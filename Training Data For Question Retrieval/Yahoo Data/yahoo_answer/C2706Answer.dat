DtkLsetkaa	How exactly do you have a horse and not know how to tack it?  Especially an Arabian, talk about a spirited breed.  Place your arm under the horses neck, with your back against its shoulders.  Bunch the top part of the bridle near the horses forehead, and place the bit near its mouth.  Place your thumb on its gums behind where the teeth stop and move your thumb towards its lips, this will force the horse to open its mouth, then you can place the bit inside its mouth (take care not to get bit!!).  Keeping your hand on its forehead will help push the head back down if it tries to lift its head too high.  I would talk to someone at your stable tho to show you exactly how to do it.  An arabian takes special care and a lot of patience, and if you don't know how to tack, you are in for a world of hurt.|`|nMe35c9Aaa	are you asking how to get it on there head or how to get the bit in there mouth. and are you asking in general or is the horse being stubborn?

Any other color or a combination of colors is a disqualification. A small white spot on the chest is permissible, but not desirable. White hairs from aging or scarring are not to be misinterpreted as brindling. Black--Blacks are all black. A black with brindle markings or a black with tan markings is a disqualification. Yellow--Yellows may range in color from fox-red to light cream, with variations in shading on the ears, back, and underparts of the dog.

They like to be with a partner, alpha male and alpha female.  I have a black clown and an orange clown.  A lot of people said they wouldnt get along, but they do.  As to tank size, you can probably get away with a 20 gallon if this is your first tank. Dont go too big, and DO NOT put these fish in a tank that has not been cycled.  You need good bacteria that takes a few weeks after setting up your tank.  You can put in lil damsels(cheap fish)  to help cycle the tank faster, but you will not keep these once the tank is cycled bc they are agressive.  You can either flush then or take them back to the fish store whe you get your tank set up.  I also believe tangs are harder to take care of, but cannot say for sure.  My parents had fish for over 10 years and never had luck with tangs, but i cannot say for sure.  As for how long the clowns live, well, i've had mine for a year now, and they have been through A LOT and are still very healthy and active.  Well, good luck!

One of my cats had similar symptoms and it turned out to be earmites. In a healthy cat you can't see earwax at all. When there is visible discharge, something is wrong.

You will have to apply them regularly, until the "wax" has gone. <br>  All the best to you and your cat.|`|0mb78CiWaa	Has your cat been scratching them a lot?

That makes the skin too alkaline to harbor the wax build up.  I've seen a big improvement with using that.  It's supposed to be better to use apple cider vinegar, but regular works too.   Just make sure there are no cuts in the cat's ears, as vinegar would make it sting bad.
AA10029366	My Malamutes have all been healthy, active, charming dogs. They were well-bred, came from responsible breeders who did genetic testing, and never suffered any major genetic problems.<br>  <br>  Their size can lead to arthritis in the hips as they get older, especially if they were active as younger dogs (mine were all shown/run in harness). They are not a breed that can deal with being obese.<br>  <br>  The Mals I dealt with were all bred or owned by a family with 4 young children, and they tolerated the kids fine...of course, these kids had been handling them since they were newborns, and had been taught how to properly interact with dogs by their parents.<br>  <br>  Intact males can be domineering. This is a breed that needs to respect you in order to live happily in your home.<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you've thoroughly investigated the Alaskan Malamute Club of America's website? It is an excellent resource.|`|o93EwErKaa	Her health is very robust.  She is 8 years old and still very active and strong - really no difference than when she was a pup.  So far, absolutely no signs of any hip or joint problems. My children were in highschool when we got her, but now I have grandchildren and she is very good with them.  She is an extremely affectionate dog, but needed a lot of socialization as a puppy because she was extremely shy.  She is also very good with my small Yorkies who try to be the boss.  She is very large though (150 lbs) so I do have to be careful just because of her size.<br>  <br>  She is a beautiful dog, but requires a lot of grooming (not so much bathing, but brushing).  The furminator has been a lifesaver, but she still sheds quite a bit.  She is extremely smart and can be stubborn at times.  My biggest problem is that she jumps fences, even extremely high fences.  She is always back before daylight, but I can't have her roaming the neighborhood.  Keeping her in at nights has worked for the most part.  She also requires two hour long fast paced "walks" per day just to let off some of that energy or she would probably jump the fence during the day too.  The runs were not a problem when my kids were home and involved in track, but now it is a little much for me alone.  If you don't have a lot of extra time for the running and grooming than this is definitely not the dog for you.  I will be returning to a harlequin Great Dane after Nikki passes.|`|kRhiSCAdaa	I have been walking one for about two years for this old man. <br>  It's an excellent dog.<br>  Its lived for many years and he said hes never had a problem with his dog.

[when i'm not looking, and then i get pissed.. lol ] Shes a sweet heart and lets any body and every body pet her, she also the man source for his wife to be able to walk around the house.<br>  The woman calls the dog and the dog gives her  a stable support when she walks. This dog has never received any training, so i'm guessing shes really smart ha ha.
321h7OVvaa	Yep, katz7dawgs2 is correct!  It's actually a bit of a joke in rescue circles that a "failed foster" is an animal that ends up being adopted by the folks who were providing foster care.  I am currently fostering my 12th dog and you can't help getting attached, especially if you have the animal for a while before they go to their new home.  I have two "failed fosters" myself - one that I just fell in love with and the other was too challenged to be adopted out - after two years of hard work, he could probably be adopted out now, but he's not going anywhere - he's my baby now!<br>  <br>  Let's be clear that the term "failed foster" has no negative meaning toward the animal in anyway.  If just means the foster folks may not be able to let the animal go to another family.|`|AA10866194	A foster failure is when the foster parent becomes attached to the pet and winds up adopting the pet.  I know from personal experience!  I work with several rescues as a transporter but only with one shelter as a foster, I have wound up adopting several of my foster kittens and dogs.  That is what foster failure means.|`|AA11593169	I would assume that "failing" means the animal is not adjusting to home life as it should. It takes a very strong person to be a foster parent. It is natural that you will become attached to any animal that you are caring for and bonding with, especially when they are living in your home. I know a little about this, as I have three dogs and four cats! (Almost all of which were foster pets!)
a2cjwMKcaa	There are ciclids you can keep in that tank, Keyhole, Kribensis or Rams would be OK.<br>  <br>  Convicts will simply kill your existing fish, especially if they are breeding.<br>  <br>  You may have agression issues even with the dawrf species, they are very good parents and will defend their breeding spots from any other fish. The Cories may still try and eat the eggs however.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|mOayTJDmaa	Convict cichlids are the easiest to breed but they'll eat the neons.  Dwarf cichlids like the ram are attractive and small.  But not the easiest to breed.  Read about the water chemistry needed for the different fish you have.  You might just have to get a 20 gallon for the neons and cories and use the 100 gallon for cichlids.  Many cichlids need hard water.<br>  <br>  Edit: Not gallons.  Ok.  Convicts are still a good choice if you use a separate tank.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Non really, the dwarfs are bottom dwellers and territorial when breeding. You have 5 Cory so the bottom is going to be crowded with a pair of cichlids. If they did breed obviously the bioload increases, so you would need another tank as the fry grow.<br>  <br>  A single Angelfish might work depending on tank shape, but at some point Neon Tetra become food.<br>  <br>  20 gallon community tank doesn't really suit cichlids and the dwarfs should have the bottom to themselves in this size setup.|`|005cb6a348aa639ee09a2a816818762baa	I certainly wouldn't recommend Convicts unless you are wanting to keep them exclusively in the 20 gallon tank.  They become TYRANTS when they have laid eggs, and for weeks after the eggs hatch, and will actually kill other fish in the tank with them. And, 20 gallons is the bare minimum size to keep Convicts.  Don't get me wrong....I have a 55 gallon tank devoted exclusively to Convicts and a few housekeeper scavengers.  But, "exclusively" is the operative word here.  I wouldn't want to place any other fish I might grow attached to in with Convicts, and expect him to live.<br>  <br>  I cannot suggest what other Cichlids might work well for you, as my experience is mostly with Guppies and Convicts, so hopefully others will be able to help you.  My only suggestion is that your choice in Cichlids not be Convicts.<br>  <br>  You would definitely not have any luck keeping your Neons or Corys alive in a 20 gallon tank with Convicts.  They would be brutally killed.<br>  <br>  Hey, what about fancy guppies?  They would get along well with your other inhabitants.  They are friendly livebearers who raise easily.  Just a thought.|`|fPmN2RQEaa	cichlids need a high ph to keep good health so no city water. most Cichlids are carnivorous so yea they will not get full size in such a small aquarium. Note: the babies will get eaten and eat each other so best to remove the babies when they hatch and be sure to keep a close eye on the baby tank for the larger ones are eating the smaller ones to.<br>  I say raise Jaguar cichlids as most pet stores do not have them and when they get really big the dark-lines nearly disappear showing the white pealescent scale just beautiful at least the one I seen in a pet store that was said to be 9 years old was so i just had to have them the biggest mouth i ever seen on a fish in a tank.

Teach him to sit at the door and praise him/give him lots of treats when he exhibits the behavior you desire.  It's going to take a few weeks to break a bad habit like jumping, but lots of praise should shortly have him trying harder not to jump.|`|a7cb19d8b3465b33cc037ff5baa35d86aa	Dont have a door.|`|f582421fab21195960a57126a91727beaa	dogs are slow to learn when it comes to innanimate things.

AA10859773	EDIT:  I may have misunderstood your question.  Or maybe I'm the only one who understood it!  LOL  I thought you meant that you are planning to continue feeding both dry AND canned foods, but you're going to have to look at other brands, and you want to know if you should buy a less expensive canned food or a less expensive dry food.<br>  <br>  So if I did misunderstand, then I cast my vote for focusing on canned food.  So long as you avoid WHISKAS (which contains a carcinogen), you'll do ok if you have to buy less expensive food.<br>  <br>  But if you are indeed planning to keep feeding both but have to find a less expensive brand of one or the other, then here's my answer:<br>  <br>  That's a darned good question!<br>  <br>  I think what I would do is choose the best dry food I could afford, and save money on the canned food.<br>  <br>  Dry foods tend to have much more distressing ingredients than canned foods do, so I would try to find the best one.  Canned foods vary much more in quality, I think, so you may be able to find a mid-level one that isn't too pricy.  Or even if you had to go with grocery store quality, it still wouldn't be completely awful.<br>  <br>  I don't know your budget, but have you considered Natural Balance?  It averages around $1 per can (5.5 oz).  I'm not sure about their dry food but I would imagine it's fairly reasonable.  If you can afford both, this would be a decent brand to choose.  Their duck & green pea is a decent dry food, and their canned foods are pretty good too.<br>  <br>  I've also heard that Chicken Soup is a decent but low priced food.<br>  <br>  If you want top of the line dry, go with Nature's Variety Instincts, Wellness Core or Evo.  There are some others but these are my top 3.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Wet is better by far.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet.

rkPdZojKaa	You mention that she has just come out of season.  How old is she? Why is she not spayed?  Was this her first heat? Why do you take her outside for the toilet instead of providng a litter box? <br>  Your cat may be experiencing the stress of going through heat cycles without being bred. Eventually, this can lead to marking in your home...and may even someday cause cancer in your cat.

svrFBaENaa	It's a bacteria bloom. It's the first stage of a cycling aquarium and there is nothing you can do to prevent it if you don't do fishless cycling.<br>  <br>  Basically, here's what's happening:<br>  Bacteria is growing in your tank. It takes a few days for this bacteria to latch on to the surfaces and start growing in your filter. Once that happens, your water will clear up.<br>  Ammonia will start to build up in your tank. Ammonia is toxic to fish so I highly recommend you get a test kit and keep an eye on that. After a couple weeks, ammonia levels will start to drop on their own, and you will start to see nitrites. Nitrites are also toxic to fish. I also recommend a test kit for those too. Again, do water changes to help keep these at a low level. In a few more weeks, Nitrites will start to drop and you'll start getting nitrates. Once you have 0 ammonia, 0 nitrites, and the presence of nitrates, your tank is cycled.|`|QV6swGUMaa	as said have ya cleaned the gravel in the tank before ya put the water in.i usually clean it in a bucket a few times until clean and then put it in the tank and add your water .|`|STPiIY8uaa	no no no lol its cloudy cuz its cycleing this will take about 3-4 weeks|`|BMri9tITaa	It's called the "Nitrogen Cycle," and you don't want to replace your water right now.  It's toxic for your fish, but it will get better.  You just need to find a temporary home for your fish, one with an already broken-in filter, until the cycle is complete.  When the cycle is done, add your fish back in slowly, one at a time, or a few at a time, until it's back up to full stocking.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Nitrogen_...</a><br>  <br>  Jason P up above explained the basics of the nitrogen cycle already, but that's a good article, and that website is a good source for all things fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bTArlHrSaa	When i got my tank the same happened, but then i washed the stones at the bottom thoroughly cause they were new and after that the water was clear for my lil fishies|`|4HQXPD4faa	im not sure really but i read some were that the male fish spray someting on eggs when they are layed and the water gose all clowdy

V5Ib9BCsaa	i think it is discrimination. they are judging a whole breed by a few owners that make there dogs "viscious". the BSL laws have been proven to be innefective and unconstitutional. there is a lady in ohio that has sued SEVERAL times because of these laws. its sad that its so hard for responsible owners to own them. my husbands in the army and we cant move on base because of ours. there is not an apt complex that alows them and its hard to find someone to rent to you with one. we pay an outrageous amount for stuff like that to own them. but honestly i wouldnt own a differnt breed of dog. they are the best dogs i have ever owned.|`|wqL84O8Naa	its a free country, but services YOU pay for aren't beyond the control of the business owners. Sadly, this is common of many insurance companies, they won't insure "viscious" dogs which is ridiculous, because dogs are no more viscious than their owners allow them to be, however, it's their right to refuse to serve you. All the more reason for people to do thier research before adopting a pet.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	give it a rest.  they don't allow it because they are higher risk for lawsuits.

Adolescent dogs often have an uncontrollable urge to chew. This could be because of discomfort in their gums as their adult teeth are settling into the jawbone. <br>  <br>  This kind of chewing also occurs as the young dog is attempting to find out about his environment and discover new things.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other reasons for chewing:<br>  <br>  An unbalanced diet – if a dog does not have enough calcium in his diet, for example, he may try to compensate by chewing stones or plaster. Puppies and dogs of all ages should be fed a balanced diet, according to their age, weight, health status and the amount of exercise they receive. You should consult your vet for advice on the best diet to feed your dog.<br>  <br>  Attention-seeking – if your dog learns that by picking something up in his mouth (such as a TV remote control) you get up and chase him round the room, he will quickly learn that this is a great way to get your attention.<br>  <br>  Distress at being left alone – some dogs cannot cope with being separated from their owners and can be destructive when left.<br>  <br>  Puppy teething - occurs from 3-7 months of age. During this time, puppies have an uncontrollable urge to chew things to relieve some of the discomfort in their gums. Chewing also facilitates the removal of puppy teeth, and the eruption of the adult set. <br>  <br>  Boredom – Dogs that are left alone for long periods or receive inadequate mental and physical stimulation are likely to become bored. Working breeds, such as Springer Spaniels, that have naturally high activity levels become easily bored in the wrong home, which can lead to destructive behaviour when left.|`|mRevWUxlaa	Crate him. Leaving him outside isn't a good ideal because it is getting warm outside. Also, he needs a place to call his own. Crates are like a den for a dog. They need that special place to get away.

Q4pUDkyHaa	Vet fees vary. If your exotic vet is good at snakes, plan on a minimum office visit of $50<br>  Add to that a fecal float, if you want it done is around $20 (To check for parasites.)  If your snake has to be wormed, or needs antibiotics, add some money for medicine, 'disposal fees', syringes,etc.<br>  My vet visits usually ran $42 for a basic visit for a reptile/avian/exotic.<br>  The vet knows that a visit is more than a normal snake would have cost you, so they will limit the costs where they can.

There are many people who do this service quite cheaply. Contact your local vet who should have a list of people offering this service. Try putting an Elizabethan collar around his neck. You can get one from the vet or make one out of cardboard.
XI2iylR4aa	I'm sorry about your piggy.  I think the idea of freezing him is a good one, if you won't be able to bury him for a few days.  We've always buried our dead pets within a day or two, but if we had to wait longer, we would put him or her in the freezer.<br>  <br>  Sorry for your loss.|`|M9o5WpOqaa	Sorry to hear about the loss of your piggie-I have lost 3 in the last 6 years and it's never easy.My last one died during the winter of 2007 and we were under 12" of snow.We carefully wrapped her up in a pillowcase,then a few small plastic bags and kept her in the garage until the ground thawed.We tried to dig every week in March but it the ground was still frozen.We were finally able to bury her in early April...<br>  I'm know she was already decomposed but at least she was wrapped in several layers and kept semi-frozen.|`|pv4nyPufaa	He has probably already started to decompose. Keeping him in the cold garage will help slow decomposition. I know this might sound a bit cold hearted, but you might want to place him and the towel in a plastic bag then either place him in the freezer or a cooler packed with ice.|`|dY7CX7qAaa	Put him in a freezer bag and store his body in the freezer.<br>  <br>  This will keep him from decomposing as quickly.
JPa0GzDjaa	You need to set a sort of discipline. You will not break a good relationship by being slightly harsh. If you don’t set out a good sort of discipline he will continue doing it. <br>  <br>  You need to give him a slight shunt in the chest with your elbow, not hard but enough he notices it and then carry on. Each time you retaliate a little he will soon know he is not to do it. You could also try moving his head away. It used to work fine with my horses, because it wasn’t like I went crazy on them or anything. <br>  <br>  You need to consider yourself higher than he is, else he will treat you like you’re below him. You need to consider that horses live in groups and that’s how they try and treat you.|`|fDDMBpwfaa	every time you go through a day when he doesnt bite u give him some food, when he bites you say no in a stern voice and dont give him any treats
y1Fihj3Maa	Chickens are very easy to keep.  They like to have ground to scratch in, a sheltered area away from wind and rain.  A nesting box, lined with straw for laying.  Chicken pellets, water, fresh air.  They love small bugs and bits of grass too, so having a space for them to free range makes very healthy chickens and eggs.  <br>  <br>  Our coop is a part of the barn, we have an inside space (Approx: 150 square feet, we have 7 rhode island red hens, and a muscovy duck, but has room for more) with nesting boxes, a door to an outside pen, well fenced top and sides. They like to perch at night, so we have a couple of small logs nailed to the wall about 3 feeet up.  When they are young, they may require a way to get to the perch, for example, a second log from perch to ground that they can walk up.  We dug a ditch around the outside pen, and buried the wire about 8 inches deep, covered in with dirt and rocks to prevent predators digging in.  We fenced the top of the pen to prevent flying predators.<br>  <br>  Predators include raccoons, mink, the neighbourhood dogs, and hawks, eagles, owls. <br>  <br>  In the winter, they are not much interested in being out, but during the summer, the pen is open.  The go out during the day, and come back into the coop at night.  We also leave our dogs outside day and night to protect them.  <br>  <br>  About once a year we treat them with flea and tick powder.  We do this at night while they are sleeping, just pick them up, sprinkle powder, rub into their feathers.  (wear rubber gloves)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!  Enjoy, I find them to be very calming animals.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Your little bantams should have three square feet per bird in the coop if they get out in a fence during the day. If confined in a coop they need seven or more per bird and about ten inches of roost per bird.
l0ktQUnWaa	Let him get used to his new surroundings. He is going through a lot of stress right now. Make sure temperatures are good.<br>  <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/reslider.html</a>|`|2YIxnXXyaa	Okay well, you'll eventually need a 120 gallon tank.<br>  Also turtles only eat in the water, so drop some turtle pellets into the water when he's older. If he doens't eat them within ten minutes, scoop them out.<br>  <br>  Also, they might not eat right away because they're in a new environment.  They're a little confused and unsure of their surroundings and that it's different.<br>  <br>  But considering he's no bigger than an inch, he's just a baby. Baby aquatic turtles don't eat pelletes or vegetation until they're about three inches. So he'll eat live/dead foods until then. It's a good idea to also give him a turtle pellet or two so he knows what they are because chances are, he'll try to nip at it and it's better to give him a variety of foods while they're babies so that they don't shy away from it later on in life.<br>  <br>  For babies, you could feed them anything that moves basically, and of course that isn't poisonous.<br>  Tadpoles, snails, small frogs, crickets, meal worms-they aren't that great though, earth worms, grasshoppers, small goldfish, guppies, minnows, shabunkins, ghost shrimp, crayfish (more so when they're big enough to kill and eat them), salamanders (NOT poisonous ones, such as the firebelly), small lizards/gekos, etc. Basically anything that's small enough for it to catch and eat and that moves. Also you can feed it raw fish from a grocery store in the meat department. And frozen shrimp that's completely thawed out.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't really feed it carrots unless it's very thin. It's not that natural for them and carrots are hard so make sure that they're peeled with a potato peeler so it's thin.  If it's too thick, it could damage their jaw.<br>  And when they're older, they can also eat strawberries, strawberry tops, collard greens, grapes and any other type of vegetation. For fruits, I would keep this to a minimum, too much is very bad for them and could cause diarrhea. Maybe once a week in small amounts is good. But only once it's older.  I doubt that it'll eat it while it's young.<br>  And also, make sure that there is always some sort of small fish in the tank with it in case it gets hungry when you're not around to feed it.  It could start trying to bite rocks or the basking area.  If it's too hard, it could damage their jaw.<br>  <br>  Also, don't forget the UVB light and the basking area. Without these two, your turtle will grow extremely unhealthy. Along with a filter because turtels are messy and can get Salmonella easily.  ALWAYS wash your hands after handling any turtle. Clean water is less of a risk.  And a water heater needs to be set to 75-80 degrees otherwise the water will get cold and slow their metabolism down, causing them not to eat as much which can lead to an unhealthy turtle. The basking area should be about ten degrees warmer than the water so 88-90 is best.<br>  <br>  <br>  These are two perfectly good examples for what your aquarium should look like<br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v373/N..." rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v373/N...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.zabludow.com/TANKWEB2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.zabludow.com/TANKWEB2.jpg</a><br>  However I don't suggest sand or anything smaller than river rock, sand turns to sludge and could clog up your filter and your turtle could swallow any small pebble and that could block their intestinse, could cause an infection and can even lead to death. So I don't suggest anything smaller than river rock.<br>  <br>  There's no such thing as knowing too much about your pet so I would do some more research.  The more the better.  And the more you know, the happier your and your turtle will be.<br>  If anything happens to your turtle, you'll need to take it to a vet.  Not a regular one, but one that specializes in reptiles.<br>  Just in case, here's a list of them in each state.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  <br>  Turtles are amazing pets and fun to watch.<br>  Hope that helped, good luck.
edmz7kqsaa	I have used PetSafe collars for a few dogs I helped train.  It's a fairly reliable brand, but I've only used the training collars with remotes.  <br>  One tried and true method of stopping a dog from running away from you (usually during a walk) is to drop, and start moaning like you are hurt.  Most dogs will come back, if only to see if you want to play.  Good luck, and you might (if possible) plant a few suprises for him, on your property.  Or have a neighbor do it.  This way, he is excercising, and getting his energy out, along with keeping him mentally interested.|`|3O6CTb3saa	Hi do you have anybody who could help you walk your dog to get exercise?  Do you have a treadmill in the house?  If you did i would put her on this every day even a couple times a day for a walk to help her get exercise.  Bigger dogs need to have lots of exercise.  I hate to see you keep her on a chain.  Chain dogs get ruined.  Check out some books in the library and videos and see if Caesar Milan the Dog Whisperer has anything on this.  The reason she slips out of the leash when you are putting her on the chain is she is trying to run away from that terrible thing of being chained up.  Kind of need to put yourself in the dogs situation.  It wouldn't be good to be chained up.  And if she does have hound in her you can't blame her for wanting to trail a scent that is their natural inborn instinct.  I know you worry about her getting hurt and that tells me you love her.  But getting a fence up would be better than shocking her.  And there is the possibility that if you shock her as she's running away she might run farther and not come back.  Good Luck!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I have heard many bad things about invisible fences and shock collars. I think your dog's problems is she's not being exercised enough -or at all, really. Do you have a friend that can walk her? Maybe you know a teenager that you could pay to take her for a run once or twice a day. All I know is, NO dog is going to mind and behave if they don't get excersized, that is just too much built up energy. I don't think an electric collar would fix the problem, just make her scared and confused as to what is painfully shocking the hell out of her.<br>  <br>  The reason no one is giving you answers about a good "training collar" is because they are inhumane. People are trying to tell you that the nice way by giving you alternative methods. The real answer is you shouldn't have gotten the dog before you had a fence. But since you did, you're going to punish the dog by shocking it? What if someone put a shock collar aroung YOUR neck???|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	FENCE!!!<br>  Right at & including the door!<br>  NOT a stupid expensive useless DANGEROUS fing "invisible " fence!<br>  A REAL one!<br>  Keep dog SAFE!<br>  <br>  Until then.keep the tether INDOORS!

LURQBU86aa	Well how much is a scoop? If it's a cup then that means you're feeding him 12 cups of food a day which is waay too much for him. For a dog that size he should be getting about 2-3 cups twice daily depending on his activity level. Consult your vet and ask them.|`|AA12128656	a year old dog doesn't need to be fed three times a day. twice is fine. <br>  <br>  bring a stool sample to the vet, just to make sure he doesn't have a parasite that would take away his nutrition.<br>  <br>  he's still growing, so he may be using his calories to grow, rather than put on weight. and he will probably ALWAYS act like he is hungry after he has eaten. many dogs will eat anything that they're given, hungry or not, because of survival instinct.<br>  <br>  i don't know what you're measuring "scoops" as, but start with the recommended amount on the bag, and add a little because he's growing. <br>  <br>  i have a dog 95 lbs who eats less than my female pit bull terrier 65 lbs, so take into consideration that his activity level and metabolism make a big difference here.|`|89512b4a439d6f311cd06b16d97c9b22aa	What do the scoops measure out to be, (a piece)?  because i put a measured amt.  of 4 cps, in the bowl my 2 GSD eat out of.. Dogs will always eat as long as it is there.  So  maybe go by the chart on the back of the dog food bag, i would maybe cut down to 2 cps per sitting, but maybe ask your vet. because he may be use to th 4 cps and you can stretch the stomach out and he is use to that much food. and if he is not over weight i wouldnt worry, maybe just drop it down 1 cup, that way you are giveing him 3 cups each time,  do that for a week, then drop it down another cup, so you will be giving him 2 cups.., but for 1 if he is not over weight dont stress it, 2 is he real active? does he get alot of  exercise? if he does he may need the xtra food, because he is burning it off.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	I'm sorry, I'm not sure what normal feeding is, it sounds like you're feeding him enough. He could have worms, check his feces if you have to, just to make sure. I know it's gross but, you may have to just to be safe.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I dont know how big your scoops are, but my very active lab mix (about the same weight) ate five cups of food every day when he was one. I have cut him back to four cups a day, now that he is two.<br>  <br>  Have you had your dog checked for worms?|`|L22hVXTIaa	You said he is a puppy, but you didn't say how old he was.

I have a German Shepherd and it look like we are barley feeding her. What we feed our dog is 'Canidae.' It has the nutritional value that the dogs need and we have one of the food dispensers.

If not that is my first thought is he has either tape worms or round worms.  If you haven't wormed him i definitely would.  Try a different food.

So worm him and try a different food ok.|`|0QtUSNetaa	he may have worms! check his feces to see. you may have to bring him to a vet to get a intestinal parasite screen. i worked in a vets office and seen many a dogs that have had the same problem.

evkp2syTaa	Foxes have rarely been known to take domestic cats.<br>  They usually prefer easier prey.|`|5f477cf9f429c86fcdfa05dc5d148aa0aa	yea, why should you worry, since you should be keeping your cat indoors like a good and responciable cat owner.|`|TdrgZwnoaa	There is nothing that a fox or coyote appreciates more than a nice juicy cat to take home to their litters.<br>  <br>   I am currently looking at my cat nursing her stiff leg in the windowsill. "Noel'' has lost two games of 'tag' with the local foxes and Coyotes.<br>  <br>   Last Summer she was housebound and under the care of the dog for 2 months while she recovered from a series of deep puncture wounds to her stomach.<br>  <br>   And in the late fall a coyote managed to put a fang through her rear leg. That appeared to heal fine with no ill effects until it became infected and she almost lost the leg. The infection has affected the leg joint but she is getting more mobile through her physiotherapy sessions courtesy of the dog. She will be ready to resume her outdoor activities any day now.<br>  <br>   Part of the risk of having pets in the country are the predators. But cats in the country are also our pest control and they have to be outside to perform that function.|`|u7vrul2Faa	I have often observed foxes eating side by side or metres from each other, foxes often only attack cats when it is the mating season or if they have offspring to protect. I still find it uncomfortable to see foxes and cats near each other as wild animals are always unpredictable. A domestic cat is no match for a wild fox. <br>   <br>  Foxes have a terrifying howling sound that they make, this could be scaring your cats and making them dash home quickly. <br>   <br>  A fox would have to be starving or caring for offspring to be desperate enough to kill a cat and eat it, however cats can get terrible injuries from a threatened fox.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	No, the only time they might fight is if one is feeding and the other wants it's meal. Neither being hunters would risk  damage in a fight with something inedible, which could result in starvation. Lots of hissing, but both parties would retreat. I've seen ewes chasing foxes to defend their lambs.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard a Barn owl kill a rat? A big owl is capable of killing a cat and should they hear the rats death scream, they would be wise to run. This is the mating season, the male will be killing for his mate.|`|0mb78CiWaa	They might if they are really hungry. But cats are pretty fierce. I do not think a fox would bother a cat. They might bother a kitten though.<br>  <br>  They may be fighting with each other. They may have been spooked by something outside. <br>  <br>  I would bring the cats in at night and lock the cat flap. That way you won't have the problem anymore, and can get a good night's rest.|`|4TX26viFaa	They would attack kittens, but not full grown cats. Foxes weigh about 8-12 pounds, you're looking at them being the same weight as a cat, who they recognise as a fellow predator.<br>  <br>  Raccoons are actually more dangerous to cats than foxes.|`|c1e9549af86c487364c948ec19681882aa	Don't let anyone fool you into believing that just because foxes are small, they won't attack your cat. They WILL if they can and want to. True, they would probably prefer to go after smaller prey, but it is not unheard of for a fox to attack a cat. A fox screech sounds sort of like a woman screaming and being choked at the same time, if that makes any sense. If you woke up to a weird animal screech and thought, "WTF was that??", it was probably a fox. <br>  <br>  A bigger concern you should have are coyotes. Coyotes WILL attack and kill cats. I have had this happen before. Alot of people are lured into thinking coyotes are so cool and reminiscent and romanticized part of the old west days or something. Dont start thinking that. Coyotes are nothing better than big vermin. They will kill your pets or small farm animals, get into your trash and your garden, chase your dog, etc. To me they are just big rats. I shoot at them whenever I get a chance. People can go ahead and thumbs down me for saying that, I don't care. That's how I feel and it's the truth.<br>  <br>  I would suggest keeping your cats indoors at night. Both foxes and coyotes are nocturnal hunters and while cats allowed to roam outdoors are always at risk of being hurt or killed by a wild animal, the chances of this happening are much greater at night. Ideally your cats shouldn't go outside at all, but that is really a personal preference that some people come to, and I'm not going to preach at you trying to convince you why you should do that. If you allow them outside, just keep them inside at night and they will be a little bit safer from wild animals. <br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope this helps =^.^=|`|800607246df3ce3c65b01624978cb3dcaa	My cats were attacked in the past by foxes. They are vicious nasty little pests. My cats were lucky to survive (my current cats live entirely indoors now). <br>  One animal that hasn't been mentioned yet is the badger. They can be really nasty creatures and I have had a cat attacked by a badger in the past as well. That cat was not so lucky. <br>  Domestic cats have lost a lot of their wild-cat instincts and are really only kittens in their minds. They do not have what it takes to defend themselves against new or unusual threats. I have learnt from bitter experience and will never let my cats out alone ever again.|`|OryQXc8naa	I would say it all depends on what type of fox it is. Some are bigger than others. In general they eat anything but since cats are pretty much the same size and weight most foxes...Im sure foxes don't go after adult cats . Cats are not afraid of big dogs, what makes you think they wont take on an animal of the same size? Cats wouldnt look for the fight and foxes neither, they are always scared. Just watch out for rabbies...|`|mR5RkClpaa	i would say they do , i have heard of them eating , wild ferral kittens, they would probably have a go at anything they could get their paws on , after all they are starving, and have no means of getting food|`|lYkvps54aa	It depends how hungary the fox is.|`|c136c061470995f88a8560ed010a00bbaa	My cat weighs 17 pounds, it would take a foolhardy fox to try it on.|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Only if desperate.|`|9Xr1wQd6aa	It is know that a fox has snatched a small cat and kittens before but only really if you live in a icolated place in the country.

T3DMhdJgaa	c0ckatiels r the right choice. they r a lot quieter than green conures. c0ckatiels LUV attention they r very cuddly-like, and they enjoy watching TV with u. when you leave the house they miss you. when you come home they chirp loudly and run to  the cage door. although when 1st get the c0ckatiel they'll be very quiet and they don't care if you leave or not, but they would still want attention. they would chirp here and there and that's it. when i first got my c0ckatiel, Shadow, she hardly chirped at all maybe only once a day! but, as she got used to me she got more attached and wanted to be around me more and more. she cared for me so when ever i sneezed or coughed she do a small chirp that she sounded like she was saying, "Are u OK?"<br>  <br>  so anyways a c0ckatiel would be the perfect bird, but the decision is totally up to you!<br>  <br>  - True Horselover|`|Ukw9DaFyaa	I'd say a Green Cheek Conure. I have one and I love him.|`|WCNsmyZBaa	I dont know much about conures but cockatiels are really nice ..<br>  They are really quiet (compared to other birds)<br>  They arent expensive and their care is fairly easy <br>  You could definatly chill with a cockatiel <br>  <br>  And just because a birds cheap doesnt mean that they have less personality or are dumb ;\<br>  <br>  No bird is a "cheapo bird"|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Any bird that you carry around on your shoulder all day will be pretty quiet.  It's only when you ignore them that they start shrieking all the time.  Also, if you put them to bed in a dark room, they won't make a sound until the lights go back on.<br>  <br>  That said, I think cockatiels are quieter in general than conures.  The conure would probably be more likely to play with toys, but they can be nippy.  I grew up with cockatiels, and the only reason they are so inexpensive is that they breed really well in captivity.  They are great pets.
5M57TTfpaa	well you already know what they eat(i feed mine cat food), and they dont eat too much at all.<br>  <br>  but to your other question, how often? i leave a little dish in my hedgehogs cage, thats almost 1 cup. i fill it up every 3 days usually. she doesnt eat the much. so your best bet is to just keep a dish in there for your hedgehog. mine usually eats at night when she wakes up, but i have seen her eating during the day. if you want to feed your hedgehog at a certain time of the day, thats up to you... hedgehogs are normally nocturnal, so will eat at night, which is when you could feed(maybe 1/5 cup?), but i have heard that you can gradually change your feed to morning time, having your hedgehog wake up when you do for breakfast and no longer be nocturnal. i have never done this though.|`|AA10356572	here is a link on Hedgehogs<br>  <a href="http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pets-Hedgehogs.86789" rel="nofollow">http://www.gomestic.com/Pets/Unusual-Pet...</a><br>  I think it will help you <br>  how much they eat depends on what you are feeding them, how big/old they are and how bored they are|`|VTf97QPOaa	Beetles, caterpillars, earthworms, slugs and snails are the hedgehog's favourite food, but the diet is varied and they will also eat cereals, pet foods, and fresh meat.<br>  <br>  Tinned cat or dog food and even dry dog food is a useful addition to a hedgehog’s diet.

Also, apparently they like to eat at dawn and dusk!|`|YsMbKwTwaa	My hedgehog eats a ferret food as a staple. I also give him a few meal worms too.

BlSe3waIaa	For puppies I always use a tearless shampoo as they can wriggle and if the shampoo does accidentally get into the eyes it will not hurt. Otherwise a good conditioning shampoo for adult dogs is required. Also Angel Eyes tear stain remover is good to get rid of those pesky tear stains.<br>  A good breed tip is some Shih Tzu's are often seen clipped all over with a No.4 or No.5 Oster Clipper Blade. The head is either trimmed shorter with scissors or clipped to the same length as the body, according to the owners wishes and their capability to maintain the coat.<br>  To find out more information on Dog Grooming and Supplies go to our site at www.doggroomingsuppliesonline.com|`|Rqb9gPN5aa	If you show your dog, you do not need to be asking questions on Yahoo Answers.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Ask your vet about Angels Eyes for your dogs eyes.  It is a supplement that is sprinkled on the food.  I think at first you use it daily, but not a full dose, and then you use it like twice a week.  I am not sure about shampoo,  I use one with coconut oil in it for my Cavie.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	I use Natures Choice in my grooming salon. They have all natural pet shampoos, for yellowing in white dogs they have a great bluing shampoo. I usually use their conditioner also. But that depends on the texture of the hair. I would do your research on Angel Eyes it really does help.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	Look for a whitening shampoo and definitely get a conditioner if you are growing his hair long. I cut my Shih Tzu's hair short and still use conditioner on her tail, head & ears. I usually trim under her eyes, but she is gray so the tears don't show up as much. I would look into the angel eyes stuff someone else mentioned. And always use a blow dryer and a brush afterwards for a soft silky coat.|`|4bb411fe8f2ea252a5857d6f647a6233aa	Dogs have extremely sensitive skin and "human" shampoo should not be used on them. <br>   Ask your vet for his recommendation.  You could also go to the Shih-tzu web sites and I'm sure you will get lots of first hand information.|`|iuYtcX6Xaa	do NOT use angel eyes it is crap! At Petco get a whitening shampoo to make him extra bright and use a re moisturizer for extra softness!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	I use Oxy-med Oatmeal shampoo on my dogs. It leaves their coats soft and silky and it smells great. Its gentle on their coats and eyes.
p23mXF70aa	Yep adult food ok, best to gradually introduce it.<br>  <br>  There are many dog foods, don't think that the more you pay the better the food, not always the case. Bakers is ok. With our own dogs we use a complete dry dog food as a base and add to it often with left overs. This works well for us.|`|XIH2oKtJaa	well i wouldn't advise that dog food however old your dog is its absolute sh*t! i used to feed my dogs it and it was horrid - made them stink (erm gas lol). i would use a better quality food it costs more but you're less likely to need a trip to the vets (for allergies etc) so saving that way....|`|WtaM7mA5aa	No adult dog food yet.  It's best to feed puppy food until they are fully developed.  Ask your vet when the proper time to switch.  Most dogs keep growing and developing until they are 18 months old.  I always fed my pups puppy food till they were 18 months old.  When in doubt ask your vet.|`|pD9sj0qAaa	No he really needs puppy food as it as more nutriants in it for them if you find a place called pets at home by you they do some in there, of bakers, otherwise another good dry food is james well be loved.|`|7Sf8VD85aa	In larger breed dogs it is more important to give the correct food at the right age as their bones are developing and they need to set correctly according to the dogs eventual size and weight. In lighter breeds this is not as important as there is not the pressure on the developing bones.<br>  At 7 months your JR is the perfect age to start eating adult formula food, although Bakers is not what I would feed by choice. However it is your choice and there are many dog food companies that all claim their product is best for your dog.<br>  I personally feed my dog a diet I have absolute control over, I do actually cook my dogs meals as that way I know exactly what she is getting and in the correct ratio.<br>  Whatever you do, have fun.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Yeah you can feed adult food now..

It's specifically designed to help with his growth and health.|`|oo2Hqqanaa	Have you tried feeding him meat?|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	no, start with soft food such as Yougurt, ready made food from the boots, ask there they have certain food for this age.<br>  <br>  At home you can use the blender to do mixed fruits, vege soups...etc.|`|6DO1pNP6aa	my vet told me to start feeding adult food at around that age
yPhCujOvaa	I'd suggest being prepared for a dog that may very well occasionally prefer to follow it's nose than to follow you.  If you are okay with that, they're a great breed.  I run into the same issue with my Beagle and can never trust it off leash, as you never know when the thing will catch a scent.  So, just be careful in that regard.  <br>  <br>  I'd also suggest you research games and activities that will help your dog put that nose to work.  You could teach it to find scented objects from a young age and work on this game throughout it's life.  The dog will love games like this and if you do not provide any kind of similar "scent outlet," it may just start tracking things on it's own, which could turn into weird undesired behavior.|`|0fJe9tTIaa	I love bloodhounds, I have never owned one, but the ones I've met are very sweet. They get pretty big, but if you are willing to have another big dog, that should be fine. =) Good luck!|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol id love a bloodhound but havent done research on them yet as we still live in an apt<br>  i wonder, you might want to check and see if you gotta clean their wrinkles like a sharpei so they dont get cruddy and infected|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	As you probably know Bloodhounds are have the best developed scent smelling noses, and will follow their noses all day. So very thorough early training in basic obedience is important. But it will also be wonderful if you can do some scent training with this dog. That's what they were made for. For tips and advice on the basics of training you can visit my web site.|`|pD9sj0qAaa	Sorry i don't know much about Bloodhounds but they are cute, but what i have seen of them is they are quite aq lazy dog, but maybe that is just the ones i have seen lol, I have a 12 months old dalmation cross collie which i brought from a breeder in burnley, yorkshire (if you want any more info on her breed you can contact me).  She is the most loving, clever dog i have ever known all she ever wants to do is show her appreciation, they also breed labradoodles.xx<br>  <br>  Take care and goodluck xxx
iuYtcX6Xaa	i go to the luv my pets and have never had a problem other then the long line, their prices are reasonable and they are friendly, maybe it is just the clinic that comes to your store, which means they most likely go to all of petco's in the area. they are actual vets and vet techs that volunteer their time to do the clinic and they use the same products as at their own vet clinics. and just because your area isnt having a problem, just be greatful that you have the vaccine in case you take your dog on vacation or out of town and he is exposed to it.|`|6xphiZLSaa	Yeah I agree you should have just took your dog to a vet in the first place. I worked at Petco and saw it and I know I would never take my dog there. I take my dog to Banfield its a pet hospital located inside of Petsmarts and you can sign up for a plan and get free vaccainations and office visits it really works out look it up. That way next time you can take your loved one someone where you know he will be taken care of. Hope that helps Oh yeah and Im a groomer and we have to look at those certificates sometime for the rabies and your right you cant read a thing.

Z4UkYWlFaa	ok... looking at your pictures... i can say that she wont be giving birth any time soon... BUT seeing the male chasing the female around is a good sign that they are doing their thing... you have to pay attention to the female guppy.. look out for the huge black dot near her rear... the fatter she gets... the higher the chances of her giving birth... when her stomach gets very bloated up... that is when you must really check on her almost every 5 hours... look out for her feeding habbits.. when she stops eating and seem like she's looking for something near the bottom of the tank or finding something in hiding places, it means that she will give birth any time<br>  when that happens... you need to catch her out of the tank and into a separate container with some plants in it so that the babies could hide after birth... its advisable to cover your container with some cardboard or paper so that you will not stress the female out... check regularly to see if there's any babies in the container from time to time... female guppies are know to eat their young...<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  i hope i helped! :)|`|D75rqaihaa	if she got pregnant from your male i'd say about 3-4 weeks...but if she was preggers before (i think she was) id say about 2 weeks ish<br>  <br>  good luck|`|l1qWh9vSaa	it is pregnant, it will be about 2 weeks looking at her, they will have there young about every 4 weeks. good luck.

2qX4AkCdaa	Some mice lack either a fear of you... or they aren't paying enough attention. I used to have pet rats from a pet store that I donated to a high school classroom for their class pets because they were so open to people holding them.<br>  <br>  Mice need to interact with people on a daily basis in order to become/stay tame. Did you spend more time with this mouse than the other? Perhaps more people gave attention to that mouse in the pet store?<br>  <br>  Mice DO naturally bite, however. And they need to do this in order to keep their teeth from growing (which can lead to deformities and death). Which is why mice chew on their cages, electrical wires, fingers, etc. Buy a box from the pet store specifically made for this sort of thing, and maybe your other mouse will be so satisfied that she won't bite you anymore. They need it, anyway. If you already have one, you're an amazing mouse-owner and your mice are perfectly normal. ;]|`|1c2adb2d5aad294a18068c79ec140867aa	She won't bite you because you've never done anything to her.

1D8tMCYIaa	Okay, I'm going to try and answer all of these in a nutshell and make sure to check the links out because they can be very helpful to you.<br>  <br>  You can feed goldfish a number of things like brine shrimp, algae wafers, regular flake, par boiled veggies and a lost of fish in general like all of this stuff including tropical fish. Just flake food isn't enough for variety. There is a link to show a number of things about feeding your fishies.<br>  <br>  It's not the easiest fish to breed since they aren't livebearers, but 2 females to 1 male sounds good. You will have to keep close eye when they do lay eggs, because they can and will eat them so you will need a tank specifically for your fry. The link explains more thoroughly about breeding.<br>  <br>  A platy, like other livebearers, gestation period is approximately 28 days, but can range from 20-40 days. You also have to keep an eye out for them eating their babies as well so a fry tank is good. If her gravid spot is very large and dark, then she might be ready to have babies very soon. <br>  <br>  I don't know what you already do know about keeping a tropical fish aquarium, so I'm just going to give you a link for it. <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Beginners.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Beginners.htm</a><br>  <br>  The General rule of thumb for stocking a fishtank is 1 gallon of water for 1 inch of adult fish. 100 litres is approximately 26 gallons so figure it out from there. :)<br>  <br>  As for your loaches, give them time. They can be known to be very shy, but they will eventually warm up to you.<br>  <br>  I don't know very much about bettas, so I provided a few links that is all about breeding them. <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/Articles/BreedingBettas.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/Articles/Breedin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/aquariummagazine/oct07/betta-breeding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/aquariummagazine...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helped!|`|lAjgMFTTaa	u can feed fish (tropical and cold water) flakes, pellets and blood worm (frozen & live). <br>  <br>  you can get stress tonic from most pet shops that you can put in the aquarium to stop the fish becoming stressed, some pet shops put this in the water wen u buy new fish 2 keep em calm.|`|u39pxPpyaa	1) Don't know<br>  2) Don't know<br>  3) Yes it is.<br>  4) No idea<br>  5) Take care of them carefully.

Sea Monkeys, aka Brine Shrimp, are fine. You can also feed blanched veges like de-shelled peas, lettuce, zucchini and cucumber.<br>  <br>  2. What kind of tropical fish? Some are herbivores, some carnivores, some insectivores, some piscavores, some omnivores. Some take pellets, some point blank ignore them. What species?<br>  <br>  3. male and female what?? If you mean Bettas NO. You will get dead fish.<br>  <br>  4. Platy gestation will be 21-28 days or so depending on tank temperature (warmer temp = shorter gestation). If the belly has squared off then she should pop in the next few days.<br>  <br>  5. Pick up books, join up to websites, that will teach you what you need to know, i.e.:<br>  <a href="http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.practicalfishkeeping.co.uk</a><br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.seriouslyfish.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.seriouslyfish.com</a><br>  <br>  6.

They're not easy to breed.<br>  <a href="http://www.angelfire.com/tx3/aquariumpets/breedingneons.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.angelfire.com/tx3/aquariumpet...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishpondinfo.com/neon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishpondinfo.com/neon.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bbayaquariums.com/neon-tetra.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbayaquariums.com/neon-tetra....</a><br>  <br>  7. 10-15 male only. Less for a mix of male/female (more female than male)<br>  <br>  8. How many Loaches are there? Clowns are very large growing fish that need to be in groups, they need 280-400 litre tanks at least for a group of 6 or more. All fish will be skittish to sudden movements outside the tank. If there are fiesty tankmates they may scare them into hiding.<br>  <br>  9.If you bred the purple blue/with the black/red you'd get a ton of red probably, and the blue with the male, a whole load of blue with some red.

WkhVNEgtaa	first off hamsters need to cleaned out at the very least every week. Also it is not a specific temperature no hard and fast rules on this but it must be consistent. if your the room is too cold the hamster could hybernate an/or get a cold which could be dangerous to a small rodent.before you get a hamster you need to do some research first. learn about different breeds, different cages and there care requirements, costs, upkeep etc|`|Lk7TpfMKaa	You might be keen on it now, but it will become a chore in a few months time to clean it's cage out etc. Remember, a pet is for a lifetime not for a birthday / Christmas. Your mum will probably end up cleaning it out. By the way, your room will smell and it will be a pain if it lets loose in your house.|`|lzqfEFghaa	hamsters don't last very long<br>  mine only lasted a year and a half and he constantly escaped.<br>  they also sleep loads to.|`|SjVeoGOnaa	as long as your ready for responsibilities,the only reason it could escape is if u don't lock the door properly.<br>  but if your ready to be responsible, then you should totally get a hamster!|`|OqQPzYfHaa	NO. They are bread from rats and in many cases carry diseases. They belong dead in trash cans.|`|klOP21xTaa	Get a gerbil they are allot more fun.|`|pSgKRP8jaa	A great way to house hamsters is to use a glass cage. They somewhat look like fish tanks, but they are not. Many people use them only for reptiles, but they are perfectly safe for other small animals.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents that having a hamster will teach you how to be responsible, and if you already are, it will make you more responsible.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|rXQgWJwcaa	Getiing any pet is a HUGE responsibility. I have 2 budgies and they have a large parrot cage. Its made for 5 parrots to live in. They LOVE IT!! they fly in it everything. These kind of details you got to pay attention to. And Hamsters are cute but its heart breaking when the pass away. My hamster i had last year lived 2 years. I dont want another because i get sad when the pass away. i used a fish tank for its cage its safer but they can escape if it not sealed from the top. You can get Hamsters i know there cute but they still need alot of care!!! Good luck with gatting a hamster!!|`|r6vk5yD6aa	get a dog|`|OkBS9hhFaa	yes definately. get a chinese dwarf hampster.  they dont bite unless you hang them upside down by their back legs.|`|sHzP9u5Taa	i know someone who has a hamster and they're up all night, running around in their cage and she has trouble sleeping because of it<br>  <br>  they're nocturnal animals so beware :p<br>  <br>  xxx|`|TK1jVIkzaa	The hamster will only escape if you do not close the cage properly. Be careful and you will hopefully never have to face the joys of crawling round on your hands and knees after a scared hamster that doesn't want to be caught.<br>  <br>  I suggest a rotastack cage. They are reasonably expensive compared to your regular wire-on-a-plastic-base cages, but worth it becase you can expand the set and also it's easier to rach in for your hamster while taming them as you can access all areas relatively easily.<br>  <br>  Hamsters will not 'smell out' your room if you keep them cleaned out with fresh bedding EVERY WEEK AT LEAST. Not every 2 weeks. They shouldn't be kept in drafts and a regular house temperature will be fine for them. If the room gets really really cold you may want. to consider taking it down to the kitchen, but modern houses in general never seem to get that cold.|`|meKY251raa	I Have Two Russian Dwarf Hamsters, both stay in my room. <br>  One had babys, and so now i have 8 in my room. <br>  Also we had to spilt the male and female so now i have 2 hamster cages in my room, and soon i will have four !<br>  ANYWAY, thats not the point.<br>  Hamsters are amazing animals, and are very playful and caring. You should defianatly get one.<br>  They dont tend to escape if you have the proper cage and lock it properly, also, if you do get a hamster dont lift it for aleast 2 days, just let it get used to its new habit.<br>  Hamsters cages can smell out your room, but only if you dont clean it, if you dont clean the cage every two weeks, your room will surely stink.<br>  Right now, because i cannot disturb the babys im not allowed to clean out my cage, and it absoultly reeks !<br>  But dont worry, your room will only smell if you dont take responsibility and dont clean the cage out.<br>  Theres not excatly a certain temp for the room. <br>  Just place your hamster cage somewhere, not too warm but not too cold.<br>  If you decide to put your hamster cage somewhere that can get a little bit chilli (as in cold) its not a problem, just give the hamster loads of bedding, (i do give mine extra bedding anyway, just to make sure) .<br>  <br>  Heres also some advice on getting a hamster .. <br>  <br>  When you get a hamster cage, get one with four edges, (some people get circlular shaped ones, and the hamsters run round and round trying to find the edges!!)<br>  <br>  You should talk to your hamster often to let him/her know your voice, so that when you go to lift it and you say something the hamster will know thats it you.<br>  <br>  Wash your hands before and after touching a hamster. You need to wash your hands before as, if you were eating the hamster will think your hand is food and bite you.<br>  <br>  NEVER wear gloves holding you hamster. People sometimes wear gloves when handling their hamster as their scared of it biting them. This isnt a good idea, the hamster needs to get your scent, so it knows your smell and knows who you are.<br>  Also, hamsters tend to bite the first few times you handle them, this is only because they do not know who you are,and need to get used to your scent (smell of your hands)<br>  <br>  If you want anymore advice on hamsters, just contact me on hotmail...<br>  Caoimhe_2006@hotmail.com<br>  <br>  Thx.. <br>  I Hope I Helped,<br>  Good Luck With Your Hamster If Your Parents Allow You To Get One.
XB0UpJsLaa	Maybe a morgan Horse. They are generally a docile, loyal breed. They are extremely versatile and excel in almost all disciplines.They are also a gorgeous breed, and are very sturdy and can work into their old age. Since you can't canter yet, and are probably still a little bit of a beginner, I would not get a super young horse,or  a green-broke horse. My morgan pony could jump 3 feet, and she was the best horse I ever had. If you do look at a morgan i suggest getting a foundation morgan, or an original morgan. (because these days they have been breeding them with saddle breds..and there barely morgans anymore) I would got to the american morgan registry website. They have great info. about the breed. Good-Luck! I hope u get a horse :D|`|FoeyqAZqaa	Thoroughbred:<br>  Known primarily as race horses, Thoroughbreds also make excellent jumpers. With their long, athletic legs and powerful haunches, they can jump great heights and at great speeds. They are agile, strong and they have great endurance, which makes them a prime candidate for cross-country. Thoroughbreds are also easy keepers, which means that they keep weight on easily and don't have trouble with specialty foods. Thoroughbreds can be "hot", however, which means that they might be difficult for beginners to control.<br>  <br>  Quarter Horse:<br>  Perfect for the beginning jumper, Quarter Horses are solidly built and generally very sturdy mounts. They can't jump as high as Thoroughbreds on average but they are great for learning and they are usually very eager to please. A great misconception is that Quarter Horses are only for western sports; on the contrary, they are great for jumping if trained that way. You'll find that Quarter Horses can be bred for jumping just like any other animal, but some have a natural affinity for launching themselves over obstacles.<br>  <br>  Arabian:<br>  While I would never own an Arabian, I know many horse owners who swear by them. Arabians are smaller, thinner and more agile than either of the previously mentioned breeds, but they have plenty of energy. Many Arabians have competed at Grand Prix levels successfully, particularly when crossed with larger breeds. An Arabian might be difficult for a beginner to handle, depending on the individual horse, but their size is attractive to younger riders.<br>  <br>  Trakkener:<br>  A less popular breed, the Trakkener is a desert horse with an incredible tolerance for heat and a formidable endurance level. Trakenners are similar in appearance to a Thoroughbred, but their flanks are often more narrow. They enjoy jumping and are generally very good at it. Some successful breeders have taken to pairing Trakkeners with Thoroughbreds to find the best of both breeds, and you can find these horses in your area. They are usually more docile than Thoroughbreds and make great companions as well as jumpers.<br>  <br>  Appaloosa:<br>  Although Appaloosas are sometimes too round in the barrel for higher jumps, they are extremely strong and determined animals that won't balk at "scary" jumps. They are good teachers for younger children just learning how to jump and can make excellent eventers or hunters because of their fluid movements. Some Appaloosas have foul dispositions and many are stubborn, but this doesn't preclude their ability to jump.

PM23RDycaa	Zoer as you have learned just now there are many twits on YA int he dog section. I can guarantee you beyond the one person who actually a run in with a pitbull - the rest of them have never be around one good or bad and wouldn't be able to pick one out of a line up.<br>  <br>  The problem with BSLs is that it infringes on EVEREYONE'S rights. Not just the pitbull owner, not just the rotts not just the dobes or the GSDs. People who blindly support BSLs don't understand that eventually THEIR breed will be next. ALL pet owners needs to fight BSLs, because sooner or later it will be your dog. We need to force our local governments to actually do their damn jobs and give more money to animal control and the shelters, animal control most of all so they can hire more people AND they need to start enforcing the non breed specific laws on the books regarding bites and attacks from dogs. It shouldn't take three or more attacks in some places to have an animal taken.<br>  <br>  Innocent dogs should not face the needle at the shelter because of other people's irresponsibility.<br>  <br>  No offense meant to anyone but how do you think the Nazis lasted so long? Do you think they took everyone at once? No. First it was the gypsies, no one said anything. Then they took the mentally ill, no one said anything. They took the gays and those thought to be gay, no one said anything. <br>  <br>  They always take those that some would gladly see gone and make their way up until someone finally puts their foot down.<br>  <br>  Bluebonnet - BSLs apply to EVERYONE including breeders. SO just HOW are breeders going to clean up the bloodlines when there are plenty of problem free pet quality pits in the the world currently. When the breeding and keeping of such dogs is ILLEGAL?|`|W0buucLsaa	You know what Irish Wolfhounds were bred for? To pull people off of war chariots and kill them. Yet they don't get a bad rap. <br>  <br>  Pitbulls CAN be bred to be inherently aggressive - but ANY dog can be bred to be aggressive. Take two aggressive dachshunds and mate them, and you're likely to get aggressive puppies. Bad people do it with pitbulls and not dachshunds because pitbulls are bigger, tougher, and stronger than dachshunds. <br>  <br>  People that fight pitbulls don't take them on walks, don't register them, and generally keep them hidden. So this won't do anything to stop those folks. It's just like gun bans - the people that get guns LEGALLY and register them aren't the dangerous folks. <br>  <br>  So yeah, this potential law sucks. At least there's a grandfather clause, though.|`|179d89749bec4d1cc3b5752c11fd0745aa	Thank God I got out of that dumpy, too liberal for my taste, state when I could.  Too many illegal immigrants, and not enough jobs.. .Oregon is going downhill.<br>  <br>  That's what my thoughts are.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I own three American Pit Bull Terriers by the way... I'm glad I live in a state where no one else finds it appropriate to nose into anyone elses business.<br>  <br>  EDIT2:  Oregon is NOT a huge wooded state... Um Hello, every been to the Portland area, or how about the Salem area, any major urban area has very LITTLE trees.<br>  <br>  And dogs are NOT inherently BAD.  They are not born DEPRAVED.  That is a human issue-- dogs ARE genetical predisposed to act in a particular way, whether it be herding, retrieving, a companion, or a fighter.  APBTs were bred to be fighting dogs (against other ANIMALS), but that does not translate to human aggression.  ANY human aggression is from bad breeding, and bad treatment, PERIOD.  There is no debate about that.<br>  <br>  It takes a certain kind of owner to own, train, and manage difficult and potentially (yes, they do have the potential) dangerous breeds like American Pit Bull Terriers, and lets face it, the majority of the population is NOT fit to own one.|`|DgCsBWk9aa	i 100% agree with you.<br>  <br>  my dog is a doberman pinscher.<br>  now most people would think that just because hes a doberman he is mean and tough and dangerous.<br>  <br>  but logical people, like you and me, know that dogs are there own person, and it dosent matter what breed they are, all dogs have a diffrent personality.<br>  <br>  my doberman is super nice, non vicious, sensitive, and peacful. <br>  <br>  ALL DOGS ARE HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONALITY,,,or should i say dogonality :D<br>  <br>  haha|`|mRevWUxlaa	I don't understand these "LAWS" that they try to pass! I own 2 APBT's and If they ever tried to pass that kind of law, 50% of people in Nevada would have to get rid of their beloved pets! Banning breeding non registered animals would be more causable I would think as that would significantly cut down on over breeding. But the fact remains.... I just don't see how they would be able to do this as they would have to euthanize so many animals for simple being "A PIT" and that would cost alot of money. <br>  <br>  I believe strongly, that there are no bad dogs, just bad people!<br>  <br>  Alot of people do not have the proper knowledge to speak on the behalf of this wonderful breed.

They were SPECIFICALLY bred to be fighting dogs.  There are characteristics that they have that no other breed has.  They have incredibly strong jaws and they don't just bite down, they rip and tear. That is why you hear of pit bulls mauling someone(s) and not just biting.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike the breed, in fact, I have played with several and they are just the SWEETEST.   I do however, think people need to be wise when choosing  a dog, research the breed and buy from reputable breeders and such.|`|87Zhgwmcaa	I do not agree.

IMHO, those who breed pit bulls for fighting purposes should be punished, not the dogs.|`|TflIiMKPaa	Just listen to the philosophy of cesar milan. What he has done with ex-fight dogs is incredible.

And when they are done with Pits, it might be german shepherds next, or Black labs, Or rottweilers or dobermen.<br>  <br>  Why are DOGS being punished? When will we pass stricter laws and ENFORCE them for dog fighters, for animal abusers, for people who do not properly contain their dog on leash or in their yard/house?|`|4PK0hiWeaa	The law should punish the owners of only dogs that attack, they are the ones responsible for the attacks.  Pit bulls are NOT inherently aggressive as some of you believe, it is the owner that instills the aggressive behavior in a dog.  It just so happens that they ARE inherently built with extremely strong jaws and muscular build which makes an attack by a pit bull severe if not deadly.  This bill seems like a knee jerk reaction to attacks by pit bulls.  Punish the owners not the dogs.

AA12083992	Over the years (too many to name) all my pets but one have been rescues. Some from the streets, some from shelters, some from people. I have never been sorry. Some have needed a little more work than others but the end result was always the same, a darn good pet! One little gal had been severely abused. Starved, beat, kicked & burnt with cigarettes. Even had one eye burned out. I had her for 16 years and still miss her (she's been gone nearly 15 years) She took the most work and ended up one of my best pets ever! Again, let me say, I have never been sorry! Most dogs, with proper training make great pets. The ones that don't have most likely been ruined by people. They were even able to rehab most of Michael Vick's dogs. Some dogs admittedly do need homes with no other pets or children but do fine with adults. However many people have an opinion without education.<br>  Edit: I have said many, many times...ANY dog is only as good as the training it receives!|`|AA12128656	many of these people ARE too lazy to train the dog. they think a dog who digs the yard, pees on the carpet, barks at the squirrels, and chews shoes has "behavioral problems". that's not true. dogs who do this stuff are just UNTRAINED, and need someone to TRAIN them.<br>  <br>  however, there has been many instances where the most poorly bred, nervous, neurotic dogs have been dumped at the shelter, and then adopted out to people, and there's where the REAL problems are. they're few and far between. <br>  <br>  most shelter dogs just need to be loved and trained.|`|iJtuhLMTaa	Its just a matter of failing to educate themselves the same as anything else.  While it is true that some shelter dogs have some type of behavior issue it is far from all of them and those that do are generally very easily correctable issues that the first owner was simply to lazy to deal with  (ie jumping, not housebroken etc)  <br>  You are incorrect however in stating most police dogs are rescues.  Most all police dogs are from breeders that specilize in breeding for police and military work.  The average dog simply does not have the correct temperment to do what is required of it in police work.   Also while some service dogs are resuces the majority are either donated by breeders or bred by the service organizations for this type of work.  Like police work they need very specific charateristics in the dog that the average dog simply doesn't have.|`|iXijnCxOaa	I've had shelter dogs.. I've had responsibly bred dogs..

If they raised the dog the issue is a personality quirk - if its a rescue/shelter dog its a behavioral PROBLEM.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I responded to a woman who was getting rid of her Dachshund to the shelter because it was "untrainable". What was untrainable was the way in which  she approached potty training, which was basically to just let the dog run around.

The sad part was that after dumping the untrainable one, she was planning to get another.|`|Kp5BOhNVaa	Basically any dog has the possibility of having behavioral problems.

But they are amazingly forgiving when you consider what has been done to some of them.  I've had pure breeds and shelter dogs and all have been "loves".  But I do spend time making my dogs part of the family and training them in proper behavior.  They are a family member and get the same respect as any other family member.  They get lots of love and discipline and great food and plenty of comfy living.  My dogs are treated better than some children.<br>  <br>  The only thing that would bother me about a shelter dog would be if it might suffer brain underdevelopment because of pre-birth and early nutritional neglect.|`|NgZJzEWUaa	I'm a rescue person. I spend most of my time looking for nice dogs in shelters to bring into our service dog program.  I find wonderful dogs every day... pure bred, mixed breed, owner surrenders, strays, you name it. <br>  <br>  If a dog is friendly, outgoing and confident, I'll pull it.  The rest can be taught.  If the dog doesn't make it through the program, we teach basic obedience and manners and we place the dog with a qualified family.<br>  <br>  I have seen dogs with issues turn into GREAT pets. That's the case with most of them. There are some dogs that are so damaged they can't be saved...<br>  <br>  In my opinion, shelter dogs have no more issues than those we get from breeder donations.  Some of the breeder donations are dogs that have zero socialization and are scared of life.  Give me a dog some idiot couldn't house break any day. We'll turn that dog into a great pet at the worst and a service dog for someone with a disability at the best!|`|mRevWUxlaa	Years ago I rescued a dog from horrifying conditions. she was in a chain outside with no water or food. The previous owners would give her water and she would be so excited that when she saw them, she would jump up to greet them, spilling out her water. They would say, "WELL THAT'S ALL YOU GET TIL TOMORROW!" <br>  <br>  I took her home that day. She tore up trash, and pooped and pee'd in the house constantly. She was only 4 month's old. I trained her myself by spending alot of time with her and playing as well as walking her daily. She is a border collie mix so she had high energy. She became a WONDERFUL family member as she matured. One of the best dogs Ive ever owned. She loved me and when I got married and had children, she was very gentle and protective over them. <br>  <br>  I think that shelter or rescue dogs can be re-trained if people can will just put in the effort. They seem to be greatful. I truely believe that they understand that you saved them! =)|`|w9aR8ymGaa	People hear what they want to hear.  Seriously, how many people carry on saying they know for a fact that a pit bull's jaws lock, a Doberman's brain will grow too big for it's head and it will go crazy, etc.?  They want to put down things they don't like, so instead of just saying, "I don't want to go through the process of adopting a dog, I really just want a tiny puppy" it is better (for them) to put down adoptable dogs.  Instead of saying, "I have never met a Dobe or a pit bull, but they look scary" they continue spreading the lies and myths that they have heard from people just like themselves. <br>  <br>  That is just how people are, unfortunately.  Always looking for things to hate.
y1Fihj3Maa	One of our female rabbits had her babies in the neighbours chicken coop.  When night came, and she had not returned, we brought the babies in, and set the live trap to catch Mom.  We caught her during the night, and put them all together in the hutch.  In 28 days, she had a second batch of babies.  So, we had 4 week old hoppers, and tiny new babies all living together.  So, it can happen.  This only happened once in all the years of rabbits, so you could call it rare.|`|5fjjsElbaa	any rabbit can but it does not always happen. I would remove the father from the cage when the kits are born by the way...they will sometimes kill the little ones. Also it is not good for mom to have litter after litter|`|OjXAcwJPaa	we had rabbits years ago, & at the time I was told to make sure the male & female were seperated before she had her litter, cause sometimes dads kill the young(so do some mothers too), so our male was always out before due date. If it says can, Id make sure he's out to at least give her time to get one batch weaned. We also had our male neutered :)

NAGiNKFWaa	Well no, you can't leave a puppy alone for 9 hours unless it is 8-months-old.  It is usually 1 hour for each month of age plus 1 hour, so a two-month-old puppy can only be alone/hold its potty for 3 hours at the most.  You are either going to have to cancel this puppy, or get some help somewhere, like a dog walker, pet sitter, family/neighbor/friend from church help, come home during lunch.  You don't ever want a puppy to think it is o.k. to potty in the crate, or in the house.  You begin potty training right away, but you have to realize that the bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and the puppy isn't fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  You realize you are going to have to get up every 2 hours at night to take this puppy potty, no matter what method you use.  I think you really need a plan before you get this puppy, it can't be alone or in the crate for 9 hours while you are at work, and again while you are asleep.  I think you really need to think about this, because you can't just throw away the puppy when it is too stressful.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|AA10229248	You begin training as soon as you bring her home. 9 hours is a long time to make a puppy wait. You should probably look into having a dog sitter or neighbor/friend/relative stop by at least once during the day to take the puppy out to potty. Teaching a puppy to use pee pads teaches them that it's okay to go potty in the house. Then you have to turn around and re-train them not to go in the house.|`|pLv0Ejt9aa	Puppies cannot control their bladders, you know like babies also. So what is going to happen is, if you leave a puppy in a crate for 9 hours, you are going to ask another question on Yahoo, something like: My puppy messes in her crate, what should I do? Or : I put a pad out for her but she does it anywhere she likes. Puppies does not know the difference between the floor, a carpet, the inside of a house, the outside or a pad. They do their business wherever they are when they need to, they cannot help it. They are not naughty, they just cannot control it. Human babies take two to 3 years before they can be potty trained and we want our dogs to be fully potty trained at 9 weeks. So how much sense does that make? There is an article about house training on this website. Worth reading.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Personally I don't like crate training & never would I crate train.  What did they do before crates were invented?  I believe that the old fashioned way is the best.  You wouldn't put another member of your family in a crate when you went to work.  Don't do your dog that way either.<br>  <br>  They make gates for this purpose.  Just keep him in a room that it wouldn't hurt if he pooped & peed on it.  Give him lots & lots of toys & things to do while you are gone & all will be fine.  It will be hard to house train him if you aren't there & puppies can only hold their bladder so long & they HAVE to go.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	Hmmm.. If you have to leave the puppy alone for 9 hours a day.. I think you should wait to get the puppy.. That is far too long to leave a puppy.. Crated or loose... You are supposed to be housetraining, crate training, socializing and obedience training a puppy.. Start young cause it's easier.. You have no time in your day for a dog...|`|Maho3P5kaa	The question should really be, with your work schedule should you be getting a puppy to begin with? Puppies need to be fed 3 -5 times a day, when will your dog eat with you being at work 9 hours a day? Crate training is very effective for sure but with you working that long you won't be able to really take advantage of crate training how its meant to be used. good luck and hopefully you discover that unless someone can be home every couple hours you shoulnd't get a puppy..just my opinion though|`|tY14vbrKaa	I crate trained my puppy, and I'm also gone about that long. What I did, was confine her to the kitchen with a baby gate during the day, and just clean up any messes (I do not approve of potty pads), and she would sleep in her crate at night.<br>  <br>  She's still confined, though she's 9 mos now, and hasn't had an accident during the work day in at least 5 mos.|`|DsFFjBtOaa	crate but if u can't get home to let him out ask a friend, family member or neighbor (only people you trust so they don't steal anything) to let them out.|`|yPhCujOvaa	I think you should get a part time job on Tuesdays and Thursdays to pay for the dog walker you are going to need MWF.|`|AA11992723	I got 2 crates for my new puppies. (i didn't get the pups together) I planned on crating each one though. When they got home though, I am a mush and couldn't do it, even though the crate is NOT cruel when it's used right. <br>  <br>  You are right that 9 hrs is too long for any puppy or adult dog to hold it on a regular basis. not only would it be physically harmful (causing UTIs, bladder/kidney problems, joint/muscle problems, growth problems) it will cause mental problems as well, even neurotic and/or aggressive behaviors.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to hire a dog walker or look into dog daycare when the puppy has had all his vaccines and neuter/spay. Water should not be limited.<br>  <br>  but a dog forced to hold his bladder 9 hrs every day, will most definately get kidney disease down the line.<br>  <br>  I know this is not what you want to hear, but if your puppy will be home alone 9 hours every day, you shouldn't get one i'm sorry but what is the point? Not only bad for them physically and mentally but what about YOU? They will demand all your attention when you are home, and won't you be just a little tired from working all day? <br>  <br>  ADD: I'm glad you wrote your add about only working mwf. that's a relief. you'd be surprised how people get a dog just to cuddle with them on the couch and expect that the dog doesn't need them or exercise the other 22 hours of the day.<br>  <br>  still I definately recommend a dog walker!! unless you want to try something like a matted tray that dogs can pee/poo on, but you'll never get your dog on a bathroom schedule if you allow them to go any time they want, and 9 hrs is just too long. i personally think 6 hrs should be the maximum amount of time a dog should be forced to hold it. 8 week old puppies need to go out every 2-3 hours though.<br>  <br>  <br>  here's a free online new puppy book<br>  <a href="http://www.dogstardaily.com/files/AFTER%20You%20Get%20Your%20Puppy.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogstardaily.com/files/AFTER%...</a><br>  <br>  I also recommend the book "The Dog Whisperer" by Paul owens, it is a basic dog info and positive reinforcement training book.

svrFBaENaa	Couple things will be slowing down the cycling.. like mentioned, Ammo-Lock greatly slows things down. What you want to use that stuff for is emergencies. If you get a sudden spike of ammonia above 3 ppm, it may be helpful in keeping your fish alive.. but if you are diligently changing the water, it should not be needed.<br>  <br>  The second thing slowing down the process is the diligent water changes. It reduces the amount of food the bacteria have and slows down how fast they reproduce. It sucks facing the option of making things take a lot longer or putting your fish through hell and possibly killing them.. I always go with making it take longer<br>  <br>  Bacteria in a bottle is debatable at best.. It's been my experience that it really doesn't do anything.<br>  <br>  With fish in your tank, there's not much that can be done except waiting. Nitrates are starting to show up, so the process is about half done. I always go with fishless cycling. It's not nearly as stressfull for you, or your fish, and takes much less time.|`|QV6swGUMaa	when you are cycling your tank ya should not need nitrate remover just do regular water changes when cycling with fish.do not change your filters ever.only if they are falling apart.if ya have nitrate removal sponge replace with a fine filter and take out carbon sponge.the bacterias which you need to do the cycling live in the fiter media which you have changed 2 times now.when ya have to once a month clean the filter one each month never all at the same time in tank water you do not need to replace them.your tank will cycle if ya do this.do regular water changes of 20 % for your fishes health.and get a gravel siphon to clean half of it each week never all of it as bacteria is in the gravel too good luck|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Stop using Ammo-Lock. Ammo-Lock converts ammonia to less toxic ammonium - this is still read as ammonia on some test kits. This is why it should NOT be used in cycling tanks. Don't use it and see how the readings change.<br>  <br>  Cycling with fish does take a lot longer than fishless cycling as you have to do water changes to keep the fish alive. And don't change the filter! By changing out and putting in new filter media you're throwing away all the growing good bacteria, each time throwing the tank back to square one.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Stop changing the filter.<br>  <br>  90% of the cycle bacteria live in the filter media. When you change the media, you throw away the bacteria and the cycle has to start again.<br>  <br>  Just rinse the media out in old tank water if it gets full of gunge. You dont need to use ammolock, just do partial water changes if the ammonia starts getting high. <br>  <br>  But if you stop messing with the filter the tank will quickly settle down. The nitrate reading indicates you have (or at least had) some cycle working, but you thew it out with the old filter pad.<br>  <br>  The slow start is to be expected, because you only have a few fish in there. But thats the best way if you are cycling with fish.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Ian
F27az9NEaa	Oh goodness. I would suggest going to another vet. I feel the Vets at Petsmart (I believe the clinic is called Banfield) are extremely incompetent. This isn't just coming from me though, a lot of other people have had issues with their staff-and practices.<br>  <br>  I would advise you to invest in a crate to keep your boxer in. I had to do that for my beagle, I crated him for a week, (only allowing him out to use the bathroom and eat).

Confine her to smaller spaces, a nice place to lay, and make sure it's warm enough.  <br>  <br>  Were you given pain management pills?  Antibiotics to attempt to ward off infection?|`|Rpj9qArgaa	It's not unusual for a stitch to become a bump. It should get better in a few days if not go to the vet if you see redness, puss or more swelling. Now to keep the dog calm is training. Good Luck!<br>  Ok, get a smaller crate (just enough to lay down comfortably)than what is generally recommended. I put my dogs in crates after procedures.|`|3bpwLPxjaa	I have two cats and a dog.  We use Banfield also.  I love our vet.  BUT  the office is only as good as the vet in charge.<br>  <br>  The incision will get hard.  It is the healing process.  Think about how a cut will get a scab and harden.  Put some antibiotic lotion on it GENTLY.  use one of those surgeon collars to prevent her from chewing on it. (that is as extreme as I would suggest) <br>  <br>  As far as keeping her calm, LMAO!!! <br>  It doesnt matter what bread you have, its a puppy!  <br>  As long as she isnt chewing it, or running alot, I wouldnt worry about it.  Do keep her from running hard by walking her when she needs to go out.  The crate idea is good, but not necessary.|`|KuUx34hCaa	unless you missed understood your Vet dogs only need to be keep quite for 3 or 4 days NOT NOT weeks & for a vet to recommend some thing that is not good or your breed I would look for another Vet as for the bump I am not sure but as for the Vet I thing petsmarts only want your money & they are more expensive than other vets AS a rule I just don't care for them but that is Me!  ps I just called my vet & they confirm 3 to 4 days NOT weeks<br>  Boxers are energetic & don't slow down until they are about 2yrs. old & are still energetic as old as 8 & even 10 yrs.& if the breeder did NOT inform you of this shame on them Boxers are great all around dogs but owners need to know what to expect & this is why it is so important to do research be for buying a dog  Do NOT put ointment on the sutures as they need to dry up you can put betadine
0mb78CiWaa	He is probably tired and in pain. He may be laying by his water bowl, so when he gets thirsty he does not have to walk to it. If he does not perk up in the next couple of days. I would contact your vet.|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, your cat must still be groggy from the antibiotic.  Give him 24 hours, and he should be ok... <br>  Congrats on having your cat fixed...|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Where he is laying is not really important.  He has undergone an operation, and is not feeling 100%, so he has chosen a place he feels content with.  If he is moping around more than a few days after his neutering, give the vet a call.  He should be back to normal soon.|`|AA10247319	you took his manhood. I'd be depressed too if my testicles were cut off lol<br>  <br>  But on a serious note he just had surgery so it's only natural he will want to lay around. And positioning himself by the water bowl is probably less strain on him to get to it if he is thirsty.|`|MJactYa6aa	He should be fine, he needs a light diet for 24 hours, he has gone through an operation and feeling not him self, give him time and a lot of love|`|JPa0GzDjaa	I think he's just feeling sorry for himself, and is probably still in effect of the sedation. I'm sure he'll be fine in time. Just keep an eye on him.|`|Ma9mNDRBaa	He is just getting use to the new thing. He should be fine in a couple of days. When I got my cat neutered she was doing weird stuff too. Good luck with your cat :)
mOayTJDmaa	Maybe 2cm at the most.|`|adPO2SVraa	hamsters chew on the bars and they are noisy, the bars should be smaller then the hamsters mouth so he can't chew on them|`|LdclkiILaa	Hi<br>  It all depends on the breed.. Syrian hamsters are fine with about 1cm spacing between the bars whereas dwarf breeds need a much smaller gap. They can escape between the bars if spaced too wide. Sometimes injuring themselves in the process!
7HxJvbjMaa	Sounds like  bristle worms.<br>  <a href="http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/marinewormcare/a/faqbristleworms.htm" rel="nofollow">http://saltaquarium.about.com/od/marinew...</a>|`|3ZOPNdxOaa	probably worms
KeevlZnTaa	You should not give a rat chocolate(even a tiny piece), it is not the best thing to be feeding your rat, however it is probably not the cause of her acting differently. <br>  <br>  There is really no way of knowing why she is acting differently, but when an animal has a sudden change in behavior it is always advised to see a vet. She may not want to be touched b/c she is in pain, or not feeling well, etc.<br>  <br>  There may be something medically wrong, or it could be behavioral. Maybe something startled her, and you didn't know. To be on the safe side I would seek the advice of a knowledgeable vet.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	you shouldn't be feeding your rat chocolate cake. thats probably not the reason that she is sick though. Like the previous comments said she may be pregnant. If your not sure take her to a vet and you will get a definite answer but also i suggest you start looking for homes for some of the babies. if your rat is alone you should keep one or two girls for her or she may get very lonely afterwords.|`|A2IDiIpIaa	Sadly prodigy is using incorrect information. <br>  Chocolate contains theobormine which, while poisonous to dogs (also under debate my dog ate 3 pounds of chocolate and is still running around like no tomorrow), is NOT poisonous to rats.<br>  <br>  <br>  She is (most likely) pregnant. She either got pregnant because she is housed with a male who you think is a female or she just got pregnant when she was leaving the pet store.<br>  <br>  She will build a nest and might be "nippy" and will get much fatter.<br>  She should give birth in 2-3 days.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped|`|hdQvbs0naa	Prodigy's answer likely did not mean it was poisonous, just that it shouldn't be fed to rats because it is unhealthy, which I agree with. <br>  <br>  She is also right regarding your rat's behavior. I would say it's not at all likely the chocolate that is causing her to act strangely, but beyond that we can't help you much with something like this. She needs to be examined in person by a professional for it to be determined, because all we can do is shout out suggestions that may or may not be right. Hope she feels better. :[|`|KToEYmwWaa	Sounds pregnant.|`|d6kekKgeaa	maybe you bought a pregnant rat that's about to pop.....|`|HPe8YPS5aa	First, let me start by saying chocolate in small amounts, especially dark chocolate, is beneficial for rats. They are one of the few animals who can tolerate it.  This article is great about rats and chocolate.   <a href="http://spazrats.tripod.com/chocolate.html." rel="nofollow">http://spazrats.tripod.com/chocolate.htm...</a>  <br>  <br>  I have a bit of experience in what you're going through. I adopted two 5 week old female rats from Petco and one started doing exactly what you described.  When I reached in the cage to pet her, she bit me which she had never done before. Since she was housed with males, I suspected she might be pregnant and I was right.  It ended up being one of the greatest experiences having baby rats!  I held them all from early on and they were all so loving and sweet.  They were like little dogs.<br>  <br>  Even If your rat isn't pregnant, I recommend buying a book by Debbie Ducommun called, Rats: A Complete Care Guide. The following link has some good info on taking care of mother and babies.  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4451094_care-baby-rats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4451094_care-bab...</a>  Good luck and I hope everything works out fine.|`|M7KT6NSCaa	please don't give her chocolate again but i really don't think that is the reason for her acting the way she is.....i think you should look her over and see if she has any cuts or anything hurting her.
Vl2Z390Eaa	no this doesnt mean she will stop laying she will probably lay more even if its not tomorrow. yes its 14-20 days. dont be alarmed if they dont hatch after then its her first clutch and most of the time this doesnt work. if they dont hatch after 20 days take them out. make sure she has a good diet. give her seed, egg and biscuit mix and grit you can get them all at a petshop. pull out some grass and put it on the bottom of the cage. they need plants. she will use some for the nest and eat some.<br>  goodluck:)|`|AA10546011	Just provide lots of good quality food to the parents and they'll feed the babies.<br>  <br>  It's an exciting process to go through.|`|2pjRC0Kkaa	Don't get your hopes up too much because sometimes finches do give up on nesting and get stressed out, so they break or eat the eggs. so make sure no one bothers her and provide fresh foods and water everyday. <br>  <br>  Maybe this will help:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2054601_feed-pet-finch.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2054601_feed-pet...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xQHDr1bYaa	I don't think this will probably be the end of her laying, as they have bigger clutches than that. I just suggest you don't go messing around the cage too much, as this could agitate her, and cause her to leave the eggs. Only enter the cage when changing the feed or water, and if possible, go to a pet shop and buy some bird nesting material, as she will want to make the nest as warm and comfortable as she can for her sake and the chicks (when hatched). Also, make sure she is having a good diet, and perhaps give her something to help with her calcium, as this will help her to produce stronger eggs. Give her plenty of what she likes, and just enjoy this truly unique experience!!! Good luck!

hbj6vGE4aa	Do you have any requirements from the breeder?  Reputable breeders always want at least the kennel name in the registered name.  Some even require a variation of the stud and dam names as well.  You could call him;<br>  [kennel name] All That Jazz<br>  [kennel name] Jasper the friendly dutch<br>  [kennel name] Jazz it up<br>  <br>  Just be creative, or try to put some personality traits in the name too.  My aussies registered name is Lil Miss Priss, because that describes her to a T.|`|AA10229248	Usually the dog's registered name has the breeder's kennel and/or one parent's name along with your name or kennel name and sometimes part of the dog's call name. That way the breeding kennel gets credit for the dog and if you finish him and use him for breeding you and your kennel name get credit.<br>  <br>  So if the breeder is Smithville Kennels and your kennel name is Thunder Paw Kennels, you'd want something like Thunder Paw of Smithville or Smithville's Jasper Thunder Paws. <br>  <br>  My mother had a cocker spaniel named Toby. His mother's name was Crystal Lady. My mom's name is Betty. So he became Betty's Crystal Tobias.|`|ELIKp5tDaa	lol *shrug* couldnt help you<br>  my dogs registered name was cloverdale chocolate hitman after his dad ;) his et name was roman<br>  honestly the registered name doesnt have to have anything to do with the dogs 'pet' name<br>  maybe  your name's Jasper or something like that your name's and the breeding place u got him from then Jasper? Example *Denise's bigtown Jasper* or soemthing like that?<br>  <br>  Cc why would someone name a MALE dog Xena? which was  a 'warrior PRINCESS' name?  0o|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	They're REGISTERABLE???? <br>  With who???<br>  Since when?|`|h9y6UPsfaa	mabey you should name it Xena or the name you picked cause it sound goo to me
nPdKJyK4aa	I would find a small animal vet and get them to the vet. Its not fair the the animal to deny them care. They can be treated pretty easily and its inhumane to just leave them. You might be able to leave them in their care while you are gone as well or find someone who will care for them. They will die a slow a pretty painful death over the next 2-3 days and if it is a URI (upper respitory Infection) then they ALL will die because its highly contaigous. BTW this kind of neglect can be reported to the police. So i'd be sure to get them checked out ASAP!
IuYekkPVaa	Some cats are very sociable, and like to have a few potential owners on stand-by, just in case standards ever drop at their home (lol).  A friend recently discovered that her cat has been visiting neighbours on Sundays, so that he gets extra portions of his favourite roast beef.<br>  <br>  Make up a paper collar with a note on saying: "If this is your cat please call this number...", so that you can ascertain whether the cat is definitely stray. Place it round the cat's neck and secure the two ends with a small piece of selloptape (don't put sellotape right round the whole thing as that can be dangerous if the cat gets caught up anywhere). If no-one calls in 24 hours you can be fairly sure he is most likely lost or stray.  You could then take him to the vets to be checked in case he has a microchip|`|DtkLsetkaa	I don't think its a silly question at all, in fact its incredibly thoughtful!!!  I would post some "Found" posters in your neighborhood and at the local vets offices.  Take him to either a vet or a local shelter to get scanned for a microchip (they do this for free) to see if he has one and if its registered.  Just because hes friendly and sweet doesn't meet hes owned, cats are amazing animals and can be sweet no matter what.  You sound like you really care for him, I hope he chose you :)|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	take him to the vet to see if he is micro chipped. put up flyers, knock on doors and try to find the owners. if none of the mentioned tips work you got yourself a cat. take it to the vet and get it micro chipped so it belongs to you and get it a license....get it fixed too.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Take him to the vet and have them check for a microchip.  If its one of the only vet offices around your immediate area, someone at the office may recognize the cat.  Then, take a picture of the cat and post "Found" ads around your neighborhood, local pounds/shelters and in the paper.  If no one claims him within a couple weeks, then you just found yourself a new pet!|`|b6lVElB4aa	ask him im sure hell tell you mine did...but then again 4 out of 5 doctors wont even see me anymore so?|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Posters and checking for a tag are good ideas.  Another is to put a collar on him with a note, asking the owner to ring you.  Someone I know who did this got a reply in minutes!<br>  <br>  An FYI for those saying people should legally keep cats in, or that any cat straying without a tag can be taken: Yahoo Answers is a world-wide service.  Unless you know the law in all countries, or know the person asking is in the same area, you might want to qualify your answers...  Here in the UK it is quite legal for cats to be out without identification, and it's up to people to fence their gardens securely if they don't want others cats coming in.  I suspect this question is from the UK...  I may be wrong!|`|BnT7HNgtaa	I would suggest taking him into your home.  You can bring him to the vet to be checked for microchips and if their are none you can also put ads in the paper saying that he was found so that the owners can find him if they are looking for them.  It's best to have him off the street though if he likes you and you are willing to take him in, that way there is a lot less risk of him getting hurt.|`|vTQN4QAzaa	Any loose animal...that doesn't have a tag on it..<br>  <br>  Legally is yours. <br>  <br>  I would bring it to a vet and get it checked out.<br>  <br>  Possession is 9/10ths of the law. And cats go over fences...moron.
BnT7HNgtaa	Some cats decide that they don't want to poop and pee in the same litter box for reasons only known to felines.  I would suggest putting another litter box in the same area as the one you already have, that may help the behavior.  <br>  <br>  Another possibility is that your kitty finds the rug more comfortable for scratching on after pooping, did you recently change litters?  If so you may want to go back to the old litter or switch around until you find one that you cat seems happy with.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	clean out the litter box and put in fresh litter. cats are notorious for being very fickle about how clean the litter box is. get a second litter box and keep them both clean.|`|i3PGjRRfaa	Throw the cat outside.............|`|lEjYhwxkaa	He probably has a bladder infection, take him to the vet to get checked out. Usually a bladder infection will cause a cat not to use the litter box. Good Luck!|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	put paper around the box|`|cSPxoFe6aa	he probably has a blader infection and it hurts when they pee so they go pee on other spots|`|AA11842750	he prob just need more attn...thats gross though dude|`|SezOZE0haa	First make sure there is no physical problem. A vet check is in order. Tell the vet what is going on so they know what to check for.<br>  <br>  If no physical problem, then it could be that you have changed the litter to something he doesn't like much. Try a different one.  Or make sure the litter is not dirty. Cats HATE to be dirty and a nasty smelly litter box would not be very appealing to him.<br>  <br>  It could also be that he is trying to get your attention - even negative attention is better than none. Try paying more attention to him.|`|FhWOpW4waa	He may not like the smell of the box.  Do you wash it thoroughly on a regular basis?  <br>  <br>  Might want to get a new litter box and see if he likes it better, or try a different type of litter.|`|VX8DlpzRaa	My two year old sister did this a lot. She would pee in the toilet and then poop on the bathroom floor. We ended up just giving her treats every time she didn't take a dump on the floor.|`|OlMNQCPPaa	clean the litter box out at least once a day.  change the litter once a week.  cats do not like dirty boxes.|`|TMAirRX0aa	Have you tried emptying the litter box?  That may help!|`|PWdPTH8paa	put the rug in the litter box|`|1CSVAn27aa	Try putting catnip in there, everyone give me thumbs up
iVQULHqYaa	I love Dally's. A friend had a Dalmation and it stayed with me when she went on holiday.Unfortunately Dally's are often bought by posers who haven't a clue about dogs.<br>  <br>  Regardless of the credentials of your ***** and regardless of how much that you want her to have puppies, take care. B1tches can die giving birth and vets expenses can be horrific. <br>  After the huge vets expenses, the expense goes on and one. You will have to pay for the puppies first shots/vaccinations and you will have to pay for their insurance for the first few weeks of their life with their new owner. In addition to this you must guarantee that you will take the puppy back if the poser who buys a dog cannot cope, or if the puppy has health problems.<br>  <br>  It's a mine field. If as you say your ***** has "all of the necessary" and if you have enough financial resources there is no problem. Thankfully you are not looking for a profit.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	You should be finding good dogs at the shows you take your female to....Oh wait, you don't show, do you? Okay, let's review: your dog must be at least 2 years old. She must have her health clearances meaning hips certified "good" by OFA or Pennhip, elbows certified normal by OFA, several normal CERF exams, several normal thyroid panels/test, no signs or family history of epilepsy, no signs of kidney or liver dysfunction and normal (bilaterally hearing) BAER results. The same restrictions apply to the stud. While we're on the topic, did you know that 8% of dals are born bilaterally deaf (deaf in both ears) and another 22% are born unilaterally deaf (deaf in one ear)? Do you want to be responsible for a deaf puppy? Most dal clubs recommend culling bilaterally deaf dogs, so they will not help you find a home for one. Do you know the pedigree of your dog? As in, know the conformation of her sire and dam, where all their puppies are (or have access to such knowledge), whether they have produced puppies with inherited defects, how long her predecessors lived and with what quality of life? If you don't even testing your dog and the stud for every preventable inherited disease will not guarantee a healthy litter because they could be carriers for inumerable problems and not show any themselves.  Do the responsible thing, don't hurt this great breed, don't put your dog through the stress and danger, get her spayed!<br>   <br>  Dalmatian health issues/concerns:<br>  <a href="http://www.thedca.org/studygp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedca.org/studygp.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dalmatianclubofsocal.org/health.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dalmatianclubofsocal.org/heal...</a><br>  <br>  Dalamatian Club of America position sttatement on Deaf dals:<br>  <a href="http://www.thedca.org/deaf1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thedca.org/deaf1.html</a>|`|5IcNNkkuaa	I suppose its safe to assume you know NOTHING about breeding, which in turn means you shouldn't try to.<br>  <br>  Leave breeding to people who know what they are doing, rather than becoming the next back yard breeder.|`|Bw18seFqaa	Most people I know find studs thru the dogs shows while they are earning CH titles on their dogs.<br>  <br>  No one with a decent stud will consider your female unless she is shown, titled, and also genetically tested for disease.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Breeding is not just throwing two dogs together.  Unless you dog is 2years old, a show champion and a great example of her breed and has passed all her genetic testing for health conditions common to her breed, she should not be bred.  The male should be the same.  If you know nothing about breeding and have no one experienced to mentor you, you should not be breeding your dog.

The Savannah is a hybrid of Serval and domestic cats, the Bengal a hybrid of the Asian Leopard Cat and domestics.  The price for either of these breeds depends on how close the generation is to the wild cat (F1, F2, F3, etc) and how well the cat matches the standard for the breed.  The Toyger is a breed being developed to have the rounder ears of a tiger and tiger striping but the current cats look absolutely NOTHING like tigers.  They may achieve this in 100 years but not likely.|`|oT71QN8Raa	First...I will never understand why people seem to think that domestic cats have more right to live than pure-breds...but whatever.<br>  <br>  Was it a toyger?  I googled and found nothing, but if by "big cat" you mean wild cat (such as tiger and/or lion) then toyger would be it.  Basically its a new breed that look exactly like tigers and/or cheetahs (spots or stripes, don't really know if cheetah is what the breeders are going for) but more acculmated for civilian pet ownership cause they are normal "cat" size :)<br>  <br>  Nothing like tigers eh?<br>  <a href="http://www.familiesonlinemagazine.com/pets/pet-descriptions/pictures/toyger-cat-facts-2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.familiesonlinemagazine.com/pe...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://kecute.files.wordpress.com/2007/06/tigers.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://kecute.files.wordpress.com/2007/0...</a><br>  <br>  ...looks pretty close to me :)
5IcNNkkuaa	There are certainly tons of food that are far better health wise to feed your dog. You could try a premium food such as Nutro, Ultra, or Blue.<br>  <br>  If you are however looking for a high quality food (it tends to be more expensive), you could look into Raw diets(BARF) such as timberwolf, Natures Variety, Merrick etc. <br>  <br>  In my opinion it's the most appropriate for dogs to eat, easiest for them to digest, and though there are inherent risks, the safest as well.<br>  <br>  However, if he's having seizures, he needs to see a vet. No matter the diet, thats usually not the cause.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	There are lots better foods but get him to the vet for now. Food shouldn't cause seizures|`|Ai8NrXB8aa	If your dog is having seizures you need to get him to the vet immediatly.<br>  <br>  BUT Iams is horrible, and you *should* change the food though. Solid Gold, Taste Of The Wild, Wellness, NutriSource, & Chicken Soup For The Dog Lover's Soul are all great.|`|52162133e9e06553229902bb43a5182caa	I don't think the food is the cause of your brittany's seizures. Although, food allergies can also cause seizures. Is this food new to your dog? You first have to find out the root cause.  Take the dog to the vet, and find out if the dog is epileptic, and you can get it on medication.  There are also other conditions that could be causing seizures, like poisonings, low blood sugars, liver and kidney disease, tumors, but, either way, the dog needs to see a vet.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	Seizures are most always early signs of Dog Epilepsy and should be taken seriously as the  condition may get worse. I just don't really think food  has something to do with it. Most common epilepsy among dogs is what they call idiopathic epilepsy, meaning the cause is unknown. Some breeds, however, are just really prone to this  disease.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that can help you out with the right information. hope your dog gets better.<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/sww.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/sww.html</a>|`|fMRcX2WDaa	food will not cause a seisure bring him to the vet asap|`|IQezKzNEaa	The seizures are most likely not caused by the dog's food.  It possible for toxins to have gotten in the food, but it probably would have been recalled.  Iam's is not the best food; it's pretty middle of the road.  The highest quality foods are going to be "specialty" foods free of corn, soy, wheat, by-products, colors, and excessive chemicals.  I personally feed Blue Buffalo, although right now they are on Purina Pro Plan because of price.  Your vet can put your dog on meds that will help with the seizures, and also give more targeted advice, as they can ask more targeted questions.|`|KuUx34hCaa	I am Not saying iams is a problem But the Best food on the on the market to date is Natural Choice for the money as it has NO Chemicals Fillers or By-Products in it I have used it for more then 20yrs|`|AOOKr1K6aa	You need to take him to a vet asap if he is having seizures.

AA11992723	I always read a sport like agility really builds confidence in dogs, plus the bond between owner and dog.;i would definately suggest agility, terriers are good at it even though the first thing you may think of with agility is a border collie, terriers are fast and agile too.<br>  <br>  how do you react when something goes wrong? dogs can smell our hormones so they know when we are mad. maybe you could also try just leaving the room when you get upset?<br>  <br>  if she's afraid of a noise, you can work on desensitization. when there's a sudden noise/movement, treat and praise her before she shows any signs of fear. If she does show fear, remove her from the situation/room, then bring her back. If she is calm when you bring her back, reward her. then repeat it again.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Some dogs out grow this & some never do.

The #1 way?  Training!<br>  <br>  Start with R+ training only, lots of treats and gentle praise.  Get her onto a schedule, IE breakfast at nine am, dinner at 6 pm.  Walk at ten am, run at 5:30 pm, etc.  If her schedule becomes predictable, the she will gain confidence.  When she understands the basic sit, down, come and stay, enroll in a basic obedience course in a group setting.  Inform the instructor that your dog is there for the socialization only, and she is a submissive urinater and needs a confidence boost.  The instructor should hopefully be able to help out with that.<br>  <br>  Try and get a CGC and do some agility as well.  Get her out and get her socialized with tons of people, places and things.  <br>  <br>  Another hint:  don't baby her.  When she gets scared, act like it is no big deal.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Please don't give up on her or give her time limits like that, sounds as if she has had a rough life and you are her first break - she needs you.<br>  <br>  I adopted a dachshund who was turned in because he was a submissive piddler like your dog.   He was a year old and cowered, rolled over, and literally was a water fountain.<br>  We learned never to approach him head on, if we had to pick him up, we did it from the side, never confronting him, and picked him up before he could flip over.<br>  You need to let the dog feel comfortable enough to come up to you, you never force yourself on the dog.<br>  <br>  We also never yell, hit, or frighten him - you are right about sudden movements triggering the piddling.<br>  Just think what this poor dog you have now went through to get her so afraid --- terriers and dachshunds are spirited dogs, takes a lot to make them this afraid and anxious.<br>  <br>  Just keep her calm, reassure her, don't confront her or get her excited or scared - she will outgrow it.   It took our dog over 2 years, he was a foster but I adopted him because I did not want someone taking him, abusing him or dumping him because he does this.<br>  <br>  He is the  most loving, charming, and grateful dog you could want - I am sure your little terrier will be too if you just have patience and keep reassuring her until she gets her spirit back - someone broke it, you can fix it.<br>  <br>  Be patient, good luck to you and the little girl.

It does have similar traits to Oscars.<br>  <br>  Angelfish would get mauled by a Jack Dempsey. Your 28 gallon is too small, especially a hex - that only makes the swimming space even less. You need more like a 55 gallon - a regular rectangular one NOT a hex or tall - for a single Jack Dempsey.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Both are species of Cichlids, as are angel fish. But they are only distant relatives.<br>  <br>  Tankmates for both are, other large cihclids, tough catfish like Plecos or BIG schooling fish like Bala sharks or tinfoil barbs. Angels are slow swimmers and would be bullied / eaten by the bigger cichlids.<br>  <br>  The JD is going to outgrow a 28gal, especially a hex one, and needs a large tank if you want to keep tankmates with it. <br>  <br>  Ian

I know several people who make homemade jerky to give to the cats and its supposed to be a wonderful treat for them (they haven't sent me any yet, you know who I'm talking to....) but I don't think the pepper is a good idea.

CtK04QcVaa	No, you should be fine to rise the filter out in the siphoned water. It will get rid of a little bacteria but your tank, if it has been established it'll also have bacteria in the gravel on the bottom of the tank. What type of filter are you using? Is it a top fin filter or something like aquaclear? Top fin only has one insert but aquaclear has 3. With aquaclear don't clean out all of them at once.<br>  <br>   I've never done it with my tank when I had it set up but we do it with our pond out in our backyard sometimes. You don't want to clean it in tap water. It has chlorine and that will kill that bacteria in your filter, which would be very bad. <br>  <br>  If you're really worried about getting rid of the bacteria, you can buy a bacteria supplement that you add in when ever you add new fish or change the water. Top fin makes one but there are others as well.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	No, it will be fine if you do it that way. The good bacteria are in the sponge and stuck to it, by just dipping it in the old tank water and squeezing it out a few time it won't remove hardly any at all. What the person that told you this was most likely stressing was the fact that if you where to use tap water and not tank water the chlorine would kill off all the bacteria.  Every two weeks is a little over kill though, maybe just do it once a month, they don't really suck up that much stuff. Good luck|`|mwYFYXXmaa	I cleaned my filter but i had to use some kind of steriliser to sterilised the tap water.

F27az9NEaa	Affection depends on the dogs personality. I've seen Yorkshire Terriers that are lovely lay in your lap, and others that are nonchalant.<br>  <br>  As for behavior, that all depends on the owner. Proper training and socialization are key.<br>  <br>  As for care, I guess it depends on what you mean. Both require grooming, all dogs require training and socialization. Yorkshire Terriers are terriers (duh) and are energetic, fiesty little things. Shih Tzus can be more relaxed, but again it depends on the dogs personality.<br>  All dogs need proper physical and mental stimuli.<br>  Because you stated you know nothing about dogs, I have a feeling you are basing the dog you want off of looks. Well dogs are more than looks, so be sure you and your family do lots of research on these breeds to be sure they suit your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  And once you have decided on a breed, there are a few things (very important to remember.)<br>  There is NO such thing as a 'teacup' or 'miniature' Yorkshire Terrier or Shih Tzu. They are toy breeds of dog. They come in ONE size.<br>  Anyone advertising these dogs as teacups, minis, or 'babydoll face' are puppymills are backyard breeders. Do Not buy from them. These dogs are nothing more than sick runts inbred with other sick runts and overpriced.<br>  <br>  Also, avoid buying online, from pet stores or from newspaper ads.<br>  These dogs come from puppymills. <a href="http://www.stoppuppymills.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stoppuppymills.org/</a>|`|A21SswSfaa	If you know nothing about dogs I wouldn't even look at dog breeds yet. I would get some books, meet some dogs, and look into what one costs and what care it needs.<br>  <br>  1. Both dogs are affectionate.<br>  2. All depends on the training of the dog and has nothing to do with the dog's breed.<br>  3. Again, all depends on the dog. For example: yorkies need less exercise but they need more attention.<br>  4. Depends on the dog and the children. I've seen some yorkies that can't stand kids and some shih-tzus that love kids and vice versa.<br>  <br>  What do you mean by "good mixes"? If you mean mutts then there's not much info to tell, all mutts are different.|`|9kcFo2alaa	Yorkie-Yorkshire Terrier (informally known as a Yorkie) is a breed of dog in the terrier category.[1][2][3] The long-haired terrier is known for its playful demeanor and distinctive blue and tan coat.[4][1][2] Yorkies can be very small, usually weighing no more than 7 pounds (3.18 kg); the standard of this breed does not mention the minimum weight accepted nor does it specify a height.[5]They are very friendly and handle children well. <br>  <br>  Shitzu-one of the smallest dogs with yorkies. They are both well behaved. They both require the same amount of care. Such as grooming, vet care ect. The Shitzu is more of a longer haired dog and their hair has to be clean and look good. Shitzu's are NOT good with heat (high room temperatures) Shitzus have quite a few health issues.  The shitzu requires more care. They are more suitable dogs with people who have allergies. Shitzus are more sensitive to allergies and is best to not give them anything that has corn in it! The Shitzu is a lap dog. Here are some good cross breeds. Shih Poo (toy poodle shitzu mix.) Shichon (bischon and shitzu mix.) Pom Shih (pomeranion shitzu mix.) Malshi (maltese shitzu mix.) Schmaltz Shi Chi and shitzu mix.) Shorkie Cavalier King Spaniel mix with yorkie. Yorkiepoo yorkie and toy poodle mix. Maltipoo maltese poodle mix. I was glad to help you!|`|i7e4hGO4aa	personally the Shitzu is a great dog the only problem is that they don't really live that long... i have a yorkie that loves to play but way to much and the care part it depends on if you want them to look like they should with long hair or not my dog hates long hair and will scratch at it all the time unless we cut it. otherwise they are basically about the same.|`|LSz1IT6Eaa	I had four Shih Tzus and love the breed.  They are very affectionate, well behaved if you train them, were great with the kids, but needed more coat care if not kept short. <br>  <br>  One lived to be almost 15, one was 14 and two were almost 13.  It nevers seems like they live long enough, but that is a decent life span for a dog in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I think the Shih Tzus are less hyper than the Yorkies, but both are nice dogs.

Choose a dry day (if possible) and a quiet time and accompany your kitten outside, allowing your pet to explore their new environment. Continue to accompany your kitten until they are used to your garden and can find their way back to the house without difficulty. Do not leave your kitten alone outside until after neutering at about five or six months old."<br>  <br>  Getting your cat microchipped would be a good idea, so that if they ever become lost, they can quickly be reunited with you.  When your cat is old enough to go out unsupervised, let them out on an empty stomach.  If they're hungry they won't be tempted to wander too far in case they miss out on meal time.

The earlier your cat can get used to the dangers of the outdoors the better your cats chances of survival are. My current cat was born in my backyard and was wild for the first couple of weeks of its life until we tamed him. Now he's a sweet cat and is very careful outdoors. Where as cats I've had in the past that I bought from pet stores, kept indoors, and then let out, ended up not being able to make it outdoors. Every cat is different, but be sure to get your cat all of his/her shots first as well to avoid the cat getting sick.|`|w2RUSkSXaa	From my personal experience, I wouldn't let it out. I had a cat that tried to get out whenever someone opened the door and sometimes she did. She would run off and come back whenever she felt like it. She got stuck in a basement by jumping through a broken window where nobody lived. We called the police and they couldn't do anything. We called a lot of people. But finally the humane society got us to get her out. Also, she has a lot of cuts on her head. Now I regret letting her out.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat.

In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|Tdzmzu4haa	we let our kitten out as soon as heed had all his jabs, he was too scared to go far, he has just had his bits of a few weekks ago when he was 6 months (which was age our last cat went out as it was from cats protection) and he doesnt wander far, unlike our other cat who we sadly lost at 18 months when he was hit by a car, letting out earlier has meant he doesnt go as far as our old cat when he was 6 months, hopefully *touch wood* we wont loose our new cat the same way|`|1N9NlhX6aa	Say all you want about the indoor/outdoor cat debate, but the fact is that indoor cats live longer, healthier lives.

If their still young, then they may change colour and be both girls or both boys. I suggest separate cages if you don't want babies. Try putting them next to each other, in case their both the same sex and you want to put them back in the same cage. Hope I helped :D|`|W6uhPj80aa	you might have to wait and see if the purpilish one is a boy it means its young and thats a good thing. Dont worry about babies they will only breed with a nest box and only if the have the same chirp/ noise
3g9HQAw2aa	This happened to one of the pups in my last litter of cavalier pups. He is perfectly healthy in every way. He is almost 11 weeks old. The spot is very small. He was checked 2 times by my vet. My vet said it would likely close by the time he was 6 months old. It's very common in toy breeds and the likely reason it happened to this pup is because he was the runt of the litter. My vet was very thorough each time. He wanted to be sure the pups brain wasn't damaged. He got a clean bill of health. The pup is doing great and has nothing wrong with him. No it's not a genetic problem to those that are being so silly in judging this. It happens. You have done nothing wrong and you couldn't have prevented it. However, I didn't want to sell him because I was worried that someone with bad intentions would take him and register him through another registry and breed him to make "teacup" cavaliers which we all know is wrong and teacup anything isn't a good thing. My mom was ready for a new pup at this point because her baby girl yorkie of 14 years died 2 years ago. So I gave him to her and she's totally in love with him. He's normal expect for his smaller size. But he's being fixed so he won't breed and he's just doing his job as being the king of her home now! Of course I will always be around him and I will get the pleasure of watching him grow and see his progress through out his life. Just keep an eye on him and give it some more time. Your vet will reassure you that he'll be fine as well! Best of luck to you. Also the spot that didn't close yet is very small. It's so small that you have to know where it is to feel it. So it's not bad at all. To those being so rude and saying mean thing, shame on you! This forum isn't for that.|`|0dda4d5d5420e22adc401448a90f4f83aa	The spelling is fontanel (or fontanelle), no wonder people didn't have a clue what you were talking about.<br>  IMO you should not be breeding and are no better than a BYB if you do not consider yourself experienced. This condition IS hereditary or genetic and this puppy needs to be sold on a spay/neuter contract or spayed by yourself.<br>  Do you actually health test your dogs? - by this I mean proper testing, not a once over by a vet.|`|DU0F48B3aa	First get an opinion from your vet.<br>  second check on the laws in your area<br>  some laws state you can't sell a dog with a known problem<br>  Ohter than chihuahuas who fontel should never close by this age all others should have closed to the best of my knowledge. there is a greater chance of a head injury or some will have fluid on hte brain'<br>  I myself would keep the dog or find it a good home for a reduced price with a spay/neuter contract and any info you have gotten from vet and stating they know this info and that the y agree to accept with these problems.|`|0J1cYbXQaa	When breeding any animals there is a risk of health problems, you can screen for lots of health conditions but not all, any breeder will understand that breeding can bring heartache.<br>  <br>  You need to understand why this has happened, so talk to breeders, vets and other people to try to gain some insight<br>  <br>  I do not think you should pass on a pup who may be unhealthy as it is unfair on the new owner and the pup, a pup who needs special care is best staying with the breeder|`|0m6BgESXaa	"one of my foundation b1tches who i had on breeders terms had the same problem, she suddenly died at 11months"<br>  Note the wording of this.

I have none so I can't answer this.|`|ZYqiay65aa	Hi, I'm in my final year at vet school and although I don't know the answer to your question I've tried to find out some more about it for you.<br>  A patent fontanelle can be associated with other diseases of the brain so it would be best to get this checked out by a vet regardless of what you decide to do with the pup.<br>  If you can find a vet who works a lot with breeders or possibly speak to a referal centre such as a university this would be best as this certainly is not a common problem.  I couldn't find any previous reports of this in cavaliers, but there may be some out there- it might be worth speaking to other breeder/breed associations to see if they have seen this before.<br>  However, even if you do find other cases of it, the outcome may be different and there is a chance this still will close by itself.<br>  If you plan to sell her, get a vet to check her over and get something in writing about what they find.<br>  I would be worried that many defects associated with the skull are genetic and I expect it would be better not to breed from her, but hopefully you can find more about this.<br>  Good luck and I hope she stays healthy.|`|P8Q39vA4aa	If the dog has a genetic defect, then you should either keep the dog and castrate. Or give it to someone and tell them of the condition and what maybe to come. The pup should be on a spay/neuter contract.<br>  <br>  I don't see why you bred a ***** that had a genetic defect like that.<br>  <br>  Im not sure what a fontel is, but whatever it is, it is an genetic defect<br>  <br>  Wait is a fontel on the skull? Cause i think i know someone in bulldogs that has had something like that, but she kept the pup or he died due to complications i don't remember<br>  <br>  Cause now that i know what it is i know for a fact its a genetic defect.|`|cETQuE9waa	I have a dog with an open fontanel. She will have this her whole entire life. She is several years old too. Nothing wrong with her. Just can't let her hit her head or run into things or she can easily have a brain injury.   The size of the open fontanel is about the size of a nickel. <br>  <br>  <br>  By 2-4 months the fontanel should close.  Although I have heard of it taking longer to close around a year old. If not it will remain open for the rest of the dog's life.<br>  <br>  This sound uncommon for your breed so I would have the vet check this puppy.<br>  <br>  In my opinion I would never breed a dog with an open font.  Then again  I would never breed a dog that couldn't whelp on its own either. I don't want a whole line of dogs with holes in their heads that can't whelp.<br>  <br>  If you know anyone involved with Chihuahuas they would be great to ask because this is VERY COMMON in them!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ADD:I am not judging you at all.

Either you keep the puppy for a while and see how it develops, or you place her, with the owners completely aware of what they are taking on.  Personally I'd not place this puppy unless you can be sure it will be okay because this is not a commodity, and emotions play a huge part.<br>  <br>  We had one, once, that had a very difficult birth and suffered oxygen starvation.  She was simply not right.  We kept her until she was 18 weeks before making the sad decision that we couldn't place her in a pet home even, and didn't have a space to keep her (she had no control over her pee or poohing) so we did the decent thing and quietly pts.  Heartbreaking, but that's part of being a responsible breeder.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	1. Get an opinion from your vet, after they have examined the pup.<br>  <br>  2. Advise any potential buyers/adopters of the problem.  Make sure they are aware of any possible issues that may result.  And to CYA, make sure they SIGN a paper that outlines the problem and confirms that they are aware of it. <br>  <br>  3. If I were able to find a good home for a pup that I thought might have a health issue, I would give it to them at either a nominal charge or for free.<br>  <br>  4. If nobody wants this pup due to the possible problems, then be prepared to either keep it yourself or put it down.
Sw1lW1AKaa	You will train your dog to know you are his owner by you training him.<br>  Dogs are pack animals they either try to be or look for a leader. By teaching him yourself the basic skills every dog needs to know <br>  ( sit, stay, lay down and so on) is going to teach him that he is your dog.<br>  <br>  Even feeding and walking. You should primarily be doing this. Multiple people feeding an animal can lead to over eating. Training your dog to walk properly on a leash yourself.... again this will show the dog who is his owner.<br>  <br>  The more time you spend building a relationship and interacting with him will establish this.<br>  <br>  your roommates should only have to reenforce what you've already taught him... its up to you to teach him before they have to.|`|jLHTDr8raa	dont let anyone else but you feed him then he'll learn that they are friends but you are owner and when he goes to bed you put him in his bed, crate,box ect.|`|yIBSIgoCaa	feed him and take him for walks.|`|t14FHs7Laa	Feed it, let it out, BE it mommy/daddy.

TSc8OE4vaa	Percheron x TB could be a good mix for a hunter, but the draft might weigh him down when it comes to jumping.  See if you can get a video of him in action and judge from there.<br>  <br>  -I like his legs a lot, he looks sturdy and built to stay sound<br>  -Bit of a thick neck, not too much of a problem, he probably got that from the percheron parent<br>  -very very slightly downhill, he is only 3 so he will probably level out<br>  -A little thick around the barrel, not too much a problem it probably came from the draft parent<br>  -Looks to have good quality hooves<br>  -Plain but attractive head<br>  <br>  All in all, I think this horse could excel as a hunter.  He could probably jump between 3'6" and 4' easily, but it's hard to estimate without seeing him in action.  He might be a bit expensive for a green horse though, see if you can get them to come down a little in the price.|`|538c1fe1a2e40d8a0eeb8046985ef01eaa	Objective comments-<br>  He is quite short in the back, which will make him strong there but can make some jumping and getting him to work on the hind more problematic, but then do go want an international level from him? he is priced high<br>  He does not seem to be put together in preportion, the cross seems to be a bit diverse.<br>  on a more positive note he has a Nice kind and attentive face.|`|tJRxQjdtaa	Oh my he is a pretty thing. Obviously you are going to need a vid to see his movement to know if he will be competitive. I am in his area and let me tell you the Baby Greens are extremely competitive around here, so I can't comment on anything other than his conformation, which is alright.

AA11621713	I would definitely work on this in-hand first. Though they say being on the ground near a spooking horse is more dangerous than being on its back, I would say in this case its the other way around given that he rears and when he does go over for the first time, he's most likely going to take a huge leap that will probably unseat you.<br>  <br>  I would start with a natural colored pole. White and brightly colored poles are much spookier looking to a horse. Use a long lead rope or even a lunge line so that you can keep your distance from him to avoid being kicked or trampled. <br>  <br>  Does he have a pasture pal? Use this horse, or another trustworthy horse to go over the pole first. Horses being herd animals will "follow the leader" quite easily when they know its okay. So have a friend walk the other horse over, while you follow with your horse a about 10 meters behind. <br>  <br>  Next, let him look at the pole. Walk him up to it rather than over it and let him put his head down to smell and study it.<br>  <br>  Stay parallel to his shoulder as you lead him over it. Don't look at him, and don't look at the pole. Just look at your destination. He's waitching your body language, and if you worry more about getting from point a to point b and pretend there's no obstacle there, he'll think less of it.<br>  <br>  When he does come around and walk over it, praise him heavily and end the session.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	I've done two things to deal with phobic horses.The first is to train them to put their head down into the relaxed position on the cue word "relax", using halter and lead rope. Say the cue, then put pressure on the lead rope and keep that pressure in place until you feel the slightest give - then release all pressure and stroke him just in front of the withers. Repeat. If he gives on the voice command, don't pull on the rope.<br>  <br>  Next, use the relax cue whenever he becomes tense at the sight of a pole. As often as you need to.<br>  <br>  Finally, you need to never let him succeed in pulling away. Brace yourself and keep the lead rope pressure on. Don't pull him forward but don't let him retreat. He may build the tension. You can either wait - he will capitulate - or push the force to the side to make him unbalance and step forward. The moment he steps forward at all, release all pressure. Then repeat so that he gradually steps forward. Combine with the relax cue.<br>  <br>  This overcomes any inadvertent training the horse has developed as a result of being allowed to shy away from frightening objects. Many times owners make shying worse by releasing pressure or attempting to console the horse out of his fear. The horse perceives that as a reward for fearful behavior and thus the behavior increases.<br>  <br>  The use of the relax cue in a variety of frightening contexts eventually will be adopted by the horse as his own and he will use it himself, spontaneously, when confronting scary objects after a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Under saddle, shying needs to be treated the same way. Keep the horse facing the scary object. Use spurs or crop ONLY to discourage retreat, and when the horse takes a single step forward, stop him and then back him away (don't turn him away). Repeat for more and more steps foirward until the shying is stopped and the horse willingly approaches the scary object.<br>  <br>  The net effect of all this is to relax the horse and prompt him to go toward scary objects.<br>  <br>  You also should work on getting the horse to stand still on lead line, putting him back in place whenever he moves. This is a key part of the quietness and stillness the horse needs to be prepared to confront scary or distracting things.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to you and your horse.|`|XJ9oSR2daa	Put him in a corral and leave poles scattered around.  <br>  <br>  Leave him there for a week where he has to eat and drink with them.  <br>  <br>  Move them around occassionally.<br>  <br>  He will get it, you just have desensitize them to it.<br>  <br>  His life will become pole ridden, thats the only way to help him overcome that.|`|vaulPrAmaa	My filly was afraid of going over the poles, so we put one down by the gate in the arena (we were inside the arena) and put hay on the other side.  I led her over the pole (after many tries, mind you) to get the hay.  I let her have one bite, I'd take the pole away, lead her back into the arena, and repeat.  I worked on it for half an hour and she never second - guessed it again.<br>  <br>  Since your problem seems to be much larger, I would suggest using a chute to get him close enough to the pole.  Stay outside the chute with a lunge whip behind him, and prod him forwards.  Go slowly - if he gets over it once that should be enough for the day, but get started again the next day.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hope this helped!|`|x787hJbBaa	I agree with mulereiner as well. I ride a horse who was absolutely afraid of water, and we do cross country, so as you can imagine that caused a lot of problems. We made him stand in a creek for two hours every Sunday, and now he neck reins through it. He had a rearing problem as well. Just desensitize him and he'll be fine.|`|WWYfEX2haa	Any time I have a horse who is worried or fearful about something the easiest way to come to an agreement is through food!  You don't necessarily have to leave him there all week (although that would be best!) if you have a few hours with him a couple times a week take him into an arena or a paddock with poles and set a bucket of grain or crunchies down right beside the pole.  Shake so he knows it's there and what it is and then just set it down and leave him be.  Don't pull or encourage, just let him decide that the pole isn't really that scary and he might consider get closer to it if it means treats!  And once he agrees to move closer to it, it's instant gratification because his grain bucket is right there beside it.|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	I agree 100% with mulereiner.  You have to get him desensitized to the poles being around.  I wouldn't just leave them lying about though.  After theyve been in the paddock or corral with him for a while, set them up as jumps and leave them in there with him.  Move them set up too.  Spend time with him while all this is going on so he associates you with the poles and that neither are going to hurt him.  I used to ride a horse that was absolutely terrified of any thing large and round, like 50 gallon drums outside arenas, large telephone spools left out by the road and tree stumps.  I just kept working him near those things and eventually he was able to deal with them.<br>  Good Luck.|`|RloOJ43haa	What Mulereiner said!

OFpl236faa	We currently have 3 Jacks and my brother is thinking about getting his next one within the next few years. We've done agility with ours for the past 5 years. Two of them are 11 years old (1 male, 1 female) and a 5 year old male. They are all rescues so come with their own little issues. The female came from a family who got 2 puppies from the same litter (bad breeder!) and then got over whelmed. She was 10 months when we got her. The 11 year old male came from a family with young kids, no fenced yard and he wasn't fixed. He came with all his belongings and he was headed to the pound if we didn't take him. The last male was on his way to be put down at the pound. He had been returned 3 times for door dashing of all things. <br>  <br>  We exercise ours daily. We do tricks in the winter, work on strengthening their bodies and other things. Then we train agility about twice a week. I would never trust any of our Jacks with a cat. Too much prey drive built in. The two oldest have done go to ground and also have killed rats. Cat wouldn't last long with them. All of ours do get along with kids, but move around too quick for really little kids. The oldest male thinks he's a big dog and has gotten himself in trouble with other dogs :) <br>  <br>  I know of some other Jack owners and they are hyper pretty much until the day they die. The 11 year olds are still going strong! Here are some pictures and video of our dogs.<br>  <br>  These are all of our rescue dogs!<br>  <a href="http://pics.livejournal.com/yeehaneeha/pic/00046r0z" rel="nofollow">http://pics.livejournal.com/yeehaneeha/p...</a><br>  <br>  This is Nub, the 5 year old...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA20Eg8RrGc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RA20Eg8Rr...</a><br>  <br>  Here is Nub and Rosie (11 year old female)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agd8DpRPjQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3agd8DpRP...</a><br>  <br>  Raleigh (11 year old male)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMx5y4VCt_w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMx5y4VCt...</a>|`|WOCnWhhbaa	I have two jack russells.  They are both girls, and one of them is absolutely a nuts, and the other one is a total lap dog.  When it's warm outside, they are mostly outside, and they love to run through the yard and go crazy.  The dog who is nuts will bark at you until you throw her ball for hours and hours and hours.  The way to deal with it, is to let them run as much as they can, for as long as you can allow them to.  The best thing for them is a fenced in yard, and if you don't have one, try to find a friend who does, or somewhere that you can let them run without a leash.  This is the only way my dogs will calm down... I hope this is possible for you to do! Good luck! I completely understand your frustration though!<br>  (the one that's nuts hates other dogs, even dogs 2 times as big as her... So i think that's probably normal in jack russells.
H06PtiIAaa	the aquarium works for both freshwater and saltwater.<br>  <br>  with that said, lets put it this way... it is an expensive tank to be used for freshwater, but you can certainly keep plenty of live plants and a whole nice planted tank in this aquarium.<br>  <br>  For saltwater, this aquarium does come with everything for a soft coral nano reef, but if you dont know enough about saltwater, why try basically.<br>  <br>  <br>  You can certianly also go freshwater and then change it over to saltwater after you learn more about saltwater.<br>  <br>  For fishes, freshwater: all fishes that make a good community tank taht can fit into a 10 gallon tank. Such as a couple of neons and a livebearer species.<br>  <br>  For saltwater, you can get away with a pair of clownfish with plenty of live rock.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	12 gal is OK for small freshwater fish.

Guppies, platies, small tetras, cory catfish etc are suitable.<br>  <br>  I would also consider a better filter, undergravel filters do work, but not as well a good power filter.

E5gaKzCsaa	You've got a whole lot of misinformation here.Your friend is definitely pulling your chain, big time. If he really believes this stuff he tells you, then somebody pulled his. Male dogs don't "have sex" with each other. One dog mounting another is called humping and many dogs, even female dogs, do it to other dogs of both genders to show they're dominant. As for one dog "raping" another, I've been around dogs for more than 30 years and this is the first time I've heard of such a thing.<br>  <br>  As for a boy dog starting to look like a girl dog, with most dogs the only way you can tell for sure what gender they are is by looking underneath to see what equipment they have. A lighter coat is not a female characteristic.|`|bfe89b40e0344af279288338e469b235aa	Actually dogs frequently mount one another as part of their social structure interaction - this is regardless of gender of the dog involved.  Probably no male dog  ever in the history of the world had not at one time or anther been on the bottom and they don't turn into girls of become feminine in any way (nor has light coat (hair) color have a darn thing to do with gender as Hulk Hogan will assure you!).<br>  I will mention they don't try to complete "the act" so dollars to donuts you did not see a rape you saw a mount|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	ROFLMAOOOOOOOOO|`|KxjUim7yaa	Some was pulling a joke on you|`|5rfnEQnGaa	grow up, my they are out in force tonight !|`|9kcFo2alaa	No this is not true.

7sb7QqAEaa	A local feed store. Feed stores are located near the country or outside of urban areas, and they usual sell animal feed for cows, chickens, etc. Around every spring (near Easter) they get an assortment of chicks and ducklings. <br>  <br>  I had a duckling once that I got from a feed store and she was the sweetest thing. She thought she was a chicken though, because we got her with a few other baby chicks. However she loved to go into a tub of water to swim in. She also laid eggs, and my whole family used to eat them (and I have to say duck eggs are better than chicken eggs!).|`|JlQl1HP9aa	try a local flee market or a farmers market.<br>  they usually have everything possible.<br>  <br>  check on petfinder.com also!|`|FtBqmFDEaa	Usually you can sex ducks by about 6-8 weeks of age.

People used to think cats were "evil" because when babies died of SIDS  they would sometimes find a cat in the cradle with it.  The truth is that cats just like the cradle because it was warm, but back in the middle ages people didn't know what SIDS was so they blamed it on the cat.  It didn't help that people thought witches could turn into cats.<br>  It is perfectly safe to let the cat run around the house at night.

wBbvGdkcaa	Your cat is an outdoor cat and likes the feeling of being free. I suggest u buy a small fence or block in a medium-size area for your cat to run and play in.<br>  And maybe the guy across the road is mistaken about your cat killing the birds.

In the long run it is usually better for the cat. There are many dangers outside.  Cats are often most energetic at night, so you might want to try to play with him with his favorite toys until he gets tired out.  You can try catnip and then get out his toys, have him chase things, etc... You could also try building or purchasing an outdoor cat enclosure.|`|HPe8YPS5aa	I'm happy to see you've decided to keep him indoors.  Cats are a huge problem to songbirds, chipmunks, squirrels etc.  As much as Havoc likes the outdoors he is also in danger from dogs, cars, poisoning, fights, getting locked in peoples garages, etc.  If he's not neutered, that may help.  Un-neutered  males tend to mark their territory by spraying and scratching.  Havoc is probably trying to protect his outdoor territory from other males.  There may be a female in heat that he wants to get to and that's why he's yowling at night. It sounds like you can't make a slow transition to indoors because of your neighbor and Havoc had to go "cold turkey".  Play with him and offer a lot of stimulation. Give him catnip and provide Kitty greens that you can buy at a pet store.  We've done this with an outdoor cat we found and he eventually stopped wailing at night. Be patient!  Once our outdoor guy got older he didn't have the desire to hunt so we let him out once in awhile.  He just hung out on our patio enjoying the sun|`|Eofxg62Eaa	get a dog or just say **** you to the neighbour let cat ot and h\eat his damn pigeons!
vMByDy1raa	I always took my bird outside but my back yard is large we have no dogs or cats in the area.  Be very careful if its windy because even clipped they could glide quite a way on the wind. Never take him out to stores without a harness.  I know several people whose birds always went everywhere with them but a car honked or made noise and the bird got loose from them.  If he goes in a tree be prepared to have a ladder or a long stick for him to step up on.  I know some people have indoor cage and outdoor cages if you have an outdoor cage don't put it in direct sunlight because the bars could get hot.   Just think what could go wrong and make provision for it.  It just like taking a little kid in the yard you have to watch then all the time.|`|7sb7QqAEaa	Id suggest you get a harness or make one yourself. There are alot of birds of prey that will swoop in an second to get your bird.<br>  <br>  -Also a bit of a forewarning, I'd suggest not to leave your bird by the window all day. Once I got home from shopping and saw that my birds were freaking out and broke many of their feathers. When I looked out the window you could see that the screen was torn and right on the sill there was a hawk!|`|uDsk8s4qaa	depends on the type of bird. i have a cockatoo. i can usually take her out if it is 40 deg or more. make sure her wings are clipped, but don't cut any blood feathers. then the quill will act like a painful straw and allow blood to leach out. any feather that hasn't totally unfurled out of the developmental covering is a bloodfeather. and if a feather has a pink thing inside it, it is a bloodfeather. you can do more research on the web.|`|PPBP6AGDaa	No sorry but definitely not unless he is wearing a harness. Even clipped birds can spook and get away, so many people lose their birds this way. You could bring him out in his cage (or harness train him), but make sure it's not too hot or cold. If it's quite warm then make sure he has access to shade and maybe even spray him down a bit before going outside.|`|E91iqvgzaa	If you have had the wings prop clipped and its warm then you should be fine!|`|1htCWW7waa	i advise not to as it still might get away|`|1O6vNjuIaa	Only if you have a safe bird-friendl backyard, I would Not recommend it being near the road, even if it can't fly if a car goes by and you bird jumps or gets scared or something......it can still glide(down).......

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It is really important to understand the way cats think and feel. Cats are not little dogs...their emotional and intellectual makeup is totally different. While many cats will respond to their "servants" when they are called, so it is obvious that they learn their names, but they only respond when they elect to do that. Cats are "faithful" companions and loyal, but at their discretion and choice at all times.<br>  <br>  Actually the fact that she is "bringing you" dead things at night.. or almost dead, is really a supreme compliment. She is trying to teach you to hunt, so you are obviously considered to be part of her clowder ( a group of cats in a feline situation). So she loves you.<br>  <br>  You may not have interviewed her for your job requirements exactly to her liking.  Since it is our job to love them unconditionally, and shower them with affection (If they are into it) and accept them as the truly marvelous pets that they are,  if you do this, your kitty will more than likely become more affectionate when she gets it that you get her!

She was in pain years after the surgery. <br>  <br>  Folks have given you excellent declaw alternatives. Have you tried soft paws? Do you know why your cat is behaving that way? Has someone played too rough with the cat, using their hands and fingers as a toy?Have you tried retraining her, by redirecting her play with toys and giving her a scratching posts and cat trees?

It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.<br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

But I'd like you to read the following and then if you really love your cat as much as you say you do then you will never consider declawing her again. <br>  <br>  Here are three comments that have been made on previous questions about declawing cats:<br>  <br>  1) I have a story for you....I took my cat to the vet one day because she had a cut on her foot that turned into an abscess nothing too serious but I heard a cat crying the whole time I was there so I asked the vet what was wrong and he said it had been declawed. He also made the comment that it was doped up on pain meds and still crying, he also made sure I knew he wasn't the one to do the amputation, the vet that owns the place did it, and told me he would never even think about doing such a thing to an animal. I went home and cried, and every time I see someone on here asking about if they should get their cats declawed I get so upset and hope they read about it and know exactly what it is to declaw a cat.<br>  2)When I was working at the shelter we had a couple come in one day to surrender their cat to us. Why? Because they had all 4 paws de-clawed at the same time. He was only 2 years old. They said he was the sweetest nicest cat before they had him de-clawed. After the surgery they said he turned out to be so vicious they couldn't even get near him with out him attacking. Sadly, he had to be euthanized as we couldn't place him in anyone's home.<br>  3)Hobbes was truly the love of my life. I adopted him when he was 10 weeks old and I was very young and foolish. I, too, bought into the idea that declawing wasn't cruel. This was 20 years ago when we weren't quite so educated about the down side... or even what the procedure really entailed. So, on the recommendation of the vet, I had him declawed when he was neutered. Hobbes lived a long life to the age of 18. He never became a biter and he never used the bathroom outside the litter box. But... he did suffer nearly debilitating arthritis as a result of his gait being altered by the mutilation that I inflicted upon him at such a tender age. See, cats don't actually get arthritis that often... it's just not common in them like it is dogs. Hobbes, however, suffered with it every day from the age of 9 to the age of 18. By the time he was 12, he couldn't even jump on furniture any more. He had to have pet steps to get anywhere. His pain was kept to a manageable level with supplements for a long time. I will never, however, forgive myself for having been the cause of his suffering.|`|IuYekkPVaa	This is a provocative question.  The obvious answer would be to telephone vets in your area and ask what they charge.  Yet you prefer to post a question that you know will arouse strong feelings in people like myself who are vehemently opposed to declawing. <br>  <br>  There are humane alternatives to delcawing, that are not only cheaper, but mean you will have a much better relationship with your cat.  Unfortunately you grew up only knowing declawed cats and as a result never learned that they can all be taught claw manners.  <br>  <br>  Both of my cats are ex-feral kittens and the female was a real spitfire.  At one stage I had so many scratches that I looked like a self-harmer, but I understood that she was young with a lot of energy to burn.  I found that using toys to play hunting-style games with her for at least one hour a day really worked.  She got to focus all her energy and aggression on them and was much calmer the rest of the time.  Once she grew out of her adolescent phase, she became a sweet and loving adult.  Your cat is still young and she will grow calmer as she matures.<br>  <br>  When she's in attack mode, instead of using a water pistol, try hissing at her.  This reawakens memories of the mother cat's discipline and is usually enough to make most cats back off.    Something else that you can try, is to distract her attention by throwing a toy or a ball of scrunched up paper. Cats are more likely to react to something if it crosses their field of vision, so when she sees a fast moving object go past her face, she's more likely to re-direct her attention from you to that object. You could also use a laser pointer to distract her as most cats love chasing after the elusive dot.<br>  <br>  These links have lots of useful advice on teaching cats to use a scratch post and how you can protect furniture, carpets, wallpaper etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you really do love your cat, please do her a favour and don't declaw.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	The cost is much more than just money...<br>  <br>  Before you decide to have your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Biting/Scratching<br>  Don't assume automatically that cats that bite are vicious creatures.  You must distinct between play-biting and real aggressive biting.  Kittens for example like to play, and sometimes pretty rough.  They use their claws and teeth to wrestle with each other.  This is how they learn to hunt and catch prey, so that’s normal.  They usually go unharmed because their fur protects them from serious wounds.  However, human skin is a different story, but kittens don't know that.<br>  <br>  When you stroke your kitten it can take it as an invitation to play and clasps your hand and bites.  That might hurt a little but is generally nothing to worry about.  Some cats make a sport out of leg biting.  They jump up on you and dig in.  Research has show that it’s a sort of unsatisfied hunting and prey instinct and lack of activity.  <br>  <br>  - Teach your kitten from an early age that hands are for feeding and stroking and NOT a toy!  <br>  - Avoid playing with your bare hands <br>  - Use a fluffy toy or a feather on a string instead <br>  - In case it grabs your hand, draw it away slowly and do NOT punish your cat, it will understand it as an attack and make matters worse.<br>  - Anytime your cat scratches or bites you, make a loud yowling sound to show that you have been hurt, (even if you really aren’t hurt). Your cat will understand. <br>  - If your cat is a "leg biter" try to spend more time playing with it and redirect its attack to a toy.  Leave toys lying around so that he can also amuse itself, particular when you keep your cat indoors. Cats need a wide variety of toys to keep them interested, so don’t expect a couple toy mice to help.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	A few months back I rescued an indoor cat that was declawed.  His owners probably thought he'd never get out of the house.  He was homeless for about 8 months before I took him in (I didnt know he was declawed until I brought him to the vet).  This cat had to work double that any cat would have to in order to get food because he had no claws.  He was also all cut up around his face and body from other neighborhood animals attacking him.  To this day, he cannot properly exercise, he loses his balance often and sometimes he decides that he doesnt want to use the litter box (all of these are long-term effects of declawing).<br>  <br>  If you love your cat you will not declaw.  You'll ruin her life.  If your furniture (inanimate object) is more important than the well being of your cat (a life, not a toy) then you should not own a cat.  Plain and simple.  Why do you think it is illegal in 25 countries?  Because it is unnecessary mutilation.<br>  <br>  Accept your cat the way she is, claws and all.  Thats what makes a cat, a cat.  You'd be doing the wrong thing if you took that away from her.<br>  <br>  This is not your last resort.  Have you tried soft paws?  If not, then declawing is not your last resort.  Try soft paws before you make any decisions - and make sure she has lots of scratching posts.<br>  <br>  You mentioned that your cat is like your child - so if your kid went around slapping people, would you cut her hands off?  Or would you teach her to stop slapping people?  Think about that.|`|gU34xa9vaa	You obviously know declawing a cat is very cruel, I think you want to be persuaded not to do this dreadul thing, otherwise why have you asked the cost on here, knowing you'd get most replies against you ? You'd have just phoned around the butchers and asked the price, IF you could find one to do it that is. I say butchers because vets are trained to help animals, not to mutilate them, so any 'vet' you find to do it, is money grabbing butcher !!!! Declawing is banned in 25 countries, it's animal abuse ...I've just answered another question from someone whose cat is in pain after this mutilation, they want to know what to do,well they can't get the cats toes put back on, that's for sure.I can't believe anyone can watch their own cat suffer because of being so selfish as to put it through the worst pain ever for a cat.<br>  You say yours is already neurotic, well she will be ten times worse if you do this to her, the odds are she'll turn to biting in her pain and confusion.<br>  If you love her like your own child, as you say you do, but you can't cope with her with claws, then do her a favour and find her a home where she'll be better understood.<br>  Prove how much you love her.|`|X5DHQxHiaa	It seems you sure walked into this one! All the answers will be not to declaw but maybe I can give you a good alternative...<br>  <br>  They sell these plastic tips that glue on to your cats nails, well instead of the regular glue, use a strong adhesive that isn't crazy glue.<br>  <br>  That worked for my cat so I wouldn't have to give him up.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Don't say you have no other options. Giving your cat away, or even to a shelter, is a much better option than declawing. You are disgusting if you can read all the information people have posted and would still consider it. <br>  <br>  If this is how you would treat your child, I hope you never reproduce.|`|z2bVBZ7Zaa	please don't declaw her! It's like taking away apart of her, it's like taking off your nails COMPLETELY. instead try a different approach, you should get this new product called pedipaws, it's really cool and doesn't hurt your kitty when you do it. sorry, I'm usually not this critical.|`|MU4EOe3oaa	* I know this is a comment and not an answer, but...*<br>  <br>  I now feel badly for not educating myself properly on de-clawing. I think I may have reconsidered had I know what I know now. Food for thought.|`|cPO5ApCQaa	Just don't do it! How would you like it if someone would rip out your finger- and toe nails because it is inconvenient for them? <br>  Obviously, your cat is troubled by something.  Find a cat behaviourist, who could work with her. Just please, don't mutilate her.|`|wx1WVpP5aa	You say your cat is extremely neurotic yet you plan to make her more so by putting her through a totally un-necessary painful procedure ? I can't get my head around that. You say you love her yet you plan to have her toes amputated ? Amputated or lasered off, they'll still be gone for good. Imagine taking an already  neurotic cat to a strange place to be put to sleep and wake up in the worst pain ever.Imagine when she realises what has happened to her. <br>  I think maybe you do just want to be convinced not to do it, or as someone said, you'd have picked up the phone and rang round vets.<br>  What would you do if you lived in a country where it was banned ? Declawing wouldn't be an option, it's a punishable offence... that says it all.|`|DtkLsetkaa	If you love your cat, you wouldn't declaw her.  Plain and simple.  Try soft paws and glue them on and see if that helps.  Cats need to be trained not to scratch, so that's up to you.<br>  <br>  The pedi paws is not a good idea, the noise bothers cats.  Get her all sorts of scratching posts and see what she likes.  Oh, and just because she is an "indoor" cat, don't think she couldn't escape one day.  It happens ALL THE TIME.<br>  <br>  Declawing leads to other nasty problems down the road, including biting, refusal to use the litter box, defensiveness, and arthritis and muscle problems.  You haven't thought this through, or you aren't aware of the issues that can arise in a declawed cat.  If you would like some links to sites, I will be more than happy to email them to you or post them here, but I believe you know how horrible it is to do to a cat, and you just want validation that its ok.  I hope you don't find it.|`|VMY7No0eaa	the alternitive that is best is the Laser removal of the nail...<br>  NOT SURGICAL REMOVAL!!!<br>  <br>  but PLEASE READ THIS FIRST<br>  ******************<br>  DECLAWING <br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/reasonsnot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/re...</a><br>  <br>  Declawing May Lead to Litter Box Problems<br>  Declawed cats often associate the pain when digging in litter with the litter box itself, and will avoid it, choosing softer carpeting instead.<br>  Declawing Sometimes Leads to Biting Problems<br>  When cats lose their ability to give a quick warning scratch, they will often resort to their second line of defense: a good, hard bite. The cat's owner may sometimes find himself the victim, just when he thinks his cat is enjoying a petting session.<br>  Cats Need the Exercise Their Claws and Toes Provide<br>  Watch a cat stretch, whether horizontally on a carpet or vertically with a tall scratching post. He will grab the carpet or sisal with his claws, using the resistance to pull and stretch his muscles. Cats' claws actually play a large and positive role in their amazing muscle tone and agility. <br>  Altered Gait May Lead to Later Joint Problems<br>  Domestic cats are digitigrade, meaning they walk on their toes. Walking with an altered gait because of the lack of the first digit of the toes can affect all the joints of the leg, resulting later in arthritis of the hip and other joints. Jean Hofve, DVM describes this joint deterioration more fully, in her article, "A Rational Look at Declawing." <br>  Cats Need to Be Cats for Their Entire "Nine Lives" <br>  Honestly, if a cat could speak human language, do you really think, given a choice, he'd say, "Sure thing. Cut off part of my toes?" His claws and toes are an integral part of making a cat a cat. Would you honestly want him to be anything less, especially since there are humane alternatives? It's your decision, but please take your cat's needs into serious consideration before making such a drastic and permanent choice.

Wn3LGHTvaa	Eastern and-3-toed box turtles are different subspecies of the same species and are capable of interbreeding freely. However, considering the time of year and your description of the female mounting the male, I think you are right and this is aggressive behavior or, at least, an effort to establish dominance
iXijnCxOaa	Now me... I just want to know who they are (pedigree)... where they're from etc.  I'm shocked that the owner isn't talking to other breeders who might be interested... although placing a male is hard.<br>  <br>  I'm full up with dogs at the moment, or I'd offer.  But if you do take them and need assistance in placing them ~ I can easily help you with that.|`|0ee4bfdaab9564dc9d539b29997544ecaa	I have a big inner child in me, so I probably would get them, then regret it later if I was working 14 hour days 6 days a week.

Can you really rely on your kids to help out in the long term, or are they like most teenagers, once they get what they want the help disappears?|`|3giaPYe8aa	It sounds like you got your hands full with the new business and all.  You don't state how old your kids are, but from my experience, sometimes the younger kids (say 10-15) can be more help than ones with a drivers license and a "life" of their own.  Does this person have any other possibilities?  I'll tell you the last time I said to myself, "gotto go get em," I ended up re-homing that "go getter" about 7 months later.  It all sounds good right now, and sometimes we feel obligated because we think we will be a better home than the next guy, but that just might be for "right now", not 6 months or more down the road.  You are the only one that can make this decision, and the clock IS ticking.  Just think of the future, not just today.  Good luck with your decision, and keep up updated if you get the new arrivals.<br>  <br>  Add:  Oh, did someone say Border....must have to do with a border lining state and a mini van.

It seems a darn shame that the dog is so close to being a champion that he won't get to finish the title. If you don't think you can handle two more dogs, why get them?

That is tough!  My inner dog lover would just be screaming "get them now!"<br>  <br>  Wow, 14 hour days, six days a week... maybe you can offer to foster them with the intent of keeping, but if it doesn't work out you could always screen the potential buyers.  Perhaps you can just keep one of them?<br>  <br>  Good luck!  I'm glad its you and not me :)|`|YUQgyPT3aa	Do you want them because they're free or because you want to give a good home to some dogs in need...<br>  <br>  You could take them on a temp basis (foster) until you can decide if it'll work or if you will want to be finding a suitable home for them.|`|x8Vgu6acaa	Go ahead and go and look at them immediately.  But, tell yourself and the woman you need at least 24 hours to think about it after you have met them.  (or whatever time you think you need)  This is a huge decision. Not one to make becuase you may miss out on a good deal.  If the woman likes you and feels that they would have a good home with you, she will wait.  <br>  If it is meant to be it will happen.  The worst thing you can do is to instantly adopt 2 more dogs when you are not ready, just on a whim.  Or because that inner child is excited.  You need some time for the Inner adult to gain control and think things out.
qjFu9SjKaa	The best thing to do would be to provide them with a lot of bedding, so that they are comfortable, however it would be better if you just had a free room or made a pen for them and they could stay there-- however 20 guinea pigs are a lot so i understand your problem,<br>  I am sorry i couldn't help any more,<br>  Good luck|`|HPe8YPS5aa	They will need a clean, dry, secure hutch. The very minimum requirement for two guinea pigs is 36"x18"x18", but the bigger the better. Two story hutches with a ramp provide added interest, exercise and extra space. The positioning should be carefully considered too, it should be placed out of bright sunlight and away from drafts. If the hutch is placed in drafts your guinea pigs can easily get colds or eye infections. If the hutch is in direct sunlight your guinea pigs will be exposed to heat stroke. The golden rule to remember is that guinea pigs do not like the extreme weather conditions. Most people prefer to bring the hutch into a utility room or shed for the winter away from the cold, it is also important not to forget that extreme heat can be just as harmful. DO NOT put the hutch in a garage that you are currently using for your vehicle, exhaust fumes are lethal.|`|Smg23Mb0aa	hi i have gunie pigs as well and what i do is put a water proof tarp over the hutch and that keeps them dry an warm plus they will snuggle up to each other but if you do something like that they will be fine,hope this helps you.

JPTP71IWaa	Set the bunny on the floor and have a carrot in your hand. Feed your bunny the carrot, from your hand (Be careful not to get bitten) and if you do this a few times a day, your pet should feel more comfortable around you.

Keep in mind that bunnies do not focus as fast as humans do.  So it is better to pet your bunny from behind and work your way forward.  You may think you are petting your bunny, but it might only be able to see a hand coming at it and cannot focus fast enough and might think you are trying to hit it.  sit with your bunny by your side and pet it and maybe feed it a carrot or something.

b1XStRqtaa	My rabbit was 11 years old when he passed away.  He was almost always in my bedroom in a large cage.  He was neutered and each year went in to have a check-up.  My vet never gave him any kind of shots and he was healthy for all his 11 years until he died of old age.  I kept the cage very, very clean and I never had any health problems because of him.  He went to the bathroom in only corner of the cage.  <br>  <br>  You can litter train rabbits also.  <br>  <br>  The people who gave stupid answers, ignore them.  They obviously don't like animals if a little smell deters them from owning one.

tMtBe1lKaa	Get a larger tank now, rather than later- go to craigslist and search for your area. Usually there are tanks with everything. here, I've seen 55 gallons go for between 50-150, depending on accessories and existing fish and stands/lighting etc. Just make sure it can hold water. When you do buy another, be sure to cycle your water. I can't beleive how many people don't do this! Anyway, the larger they are, the harder they are to move. Oscars get especially big in under a year, and the dempseys get very territorial as they get larger. I've heard of them killing oscars much larger than they are. <br>  55 is the minimum, a 75 would be better. I'm buying a 135 with fish and everything for 200, and the  2 oscars in it look big even in a big tank! There are also 4-5 large dempseys in that tank, but I'm suprised they haven't eaten each other yet. I'll be splitting them up a bit among several tanks and friends. It won't do much good to switch them among those two tanks, just start looking for a larger one. Best of luck!|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Both tanks are too small for those fish as they grow. Moving them around is like re-arranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.<br>  <br>  JDs will grow to 8-10 inches, and really need about 55gals, for one fish.<br>  <br>  The Oscars should grow to over 12", maybe up to 15". 55gal is an absolute minimum, 75gal would be better. <br>  <br>  The two fish may be able to live together, but that will need an even bigger tank, and it's not 100% that that will live in peace. But the bigger the tank, the more likely that they will co-exist.<br>  <br>  Fish will stop growing in a small tank, but it's not a good thing. Healthy fish grow, unhealthy fish dont. In a small tankteh water quality is poor and the oxygen level low. The fish isn't healty, so it doens't grow. Eventually it will kill them. Moving them to a bigger tank later, they may recover, but will never grow to their full potential. Thats if they dont die in the meanwhile.<br>  <br>  Ian|`|LvRdKlb5aa	For the time being, I would switch the fish.  From my experience, Oscars grow faster and larger than Jack dempseys.   The Dempsey may get a little bigger, but overall the Oscar will eventually grow much larger.<br>  <br>  A year will probably be pushing it to be honest.  Like I said given the space, Oscars can grow very fast... they're also very dirty.  So if you keep him in the 28 for too much longer, he'll outgrow it and it'll be really messy.<br>  <br>  The rumor of fish growing to the size of the tank is very false.  What actually happens is their growth gets stunted... which also puts a damper on their life span.  :(<br>  <br>  So the bigger the better for the two of them.  Like I said, the Dempsey may be close to done, but the Oscar is FAR from done growing.  Some of  them can get almost football sized... which sounds ridiculous I know, but I've seen it.<br>  <br>  If they do stay smaller because of the tanks they're in now, they usually grow super fast again after they have more room... That's what I've heard anyway. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck!  :)

OkJp8W4naa	I think homemade dog food is best for dog. I will give you some Homemade Dog Treats that provide total food balance of your dog.<br>  <br>  1.Decide on a type of flour--Expand beyond whole wheat or regular white with rye or oat flour. Since these are used less, there are animals allergic to them. There are also lots of other flours you can try.<br>  <br>  2.Choose add-ins--nuts, cheese, p-nut butter, and more will make a treat your dog will be delighted to eat.<br>  <br>  3.Decide a shape, will you use cookiecutters to cut them in the shapes of squirrels or mail carriers? Or will you just spoon the dough onto the cookie sheet? After Lucy won't know.<br>  <br>  4. Bake<br>  <br>  5.Let cool. Max may be very interested in what comes out of the oven however make him wait until they won't burn his mouth.<br>  <br>  6.Store. The harder and more dried out they are, the longer they'll last. If you bake something with a lot of moisture--like a muffin or pupcake--you'll prolong their life by refrigerating them. <br>  <br>  Check Out For More Details>>><a href="http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c380_Dog-Food.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.agritura.com/index.php/cat/c3...</a>|`|82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Yeah, you can make your own dog food...steam the veggies and they will be packed full of vitamins!!  DO NOT use turkey...it's bad for dogs...use chicken instead, add some rice and your dog will be eating like a king!!|`|lTsDwY9Paa	Yes you can, google raw food diets for dogs and the B.A.R.F diet for dogs.|`|OrvTG44laa	Yes, you can make him food.  Dogs live a lot longer if you do that.  My mom's dog was fed only homemade cooking and lived to be almost 20 years old.  Rice is really good for dogs, but you need more than that.  Pasta is good too.  Liver is also really good for them.<br>  <br>  The fact is, dog food makes dogs live shorter lives, because it is filled with crap.  My mom's dog should have lived to be 12 or 13.  He lived to be 18.  <br>  I would ask a vet about anything you are feeding him though.  Some dogs can't eat a new type of food.  My dog was given a different brand of dog food and got sick from it.|`|MBH7xIwUaa	It's strange that your dog loves fruits and veggies... it's not in their nature, and most dogs won't eat them, grapes are actually toxic to dogs. I think you could feed your dog your "dog food", but I'd recommend chicken instead of turkey too. Don't put too many veggies or potatoes in though.

WqGxGJkbaa	Firstly, get some Feliway Artificial Pheromone Diffusers and plug them in around your house, particularly in the areas where your cats will eventually meet and spend most of their time together.  These will calm and reassure your cats but they can take some time to work so the sooner you get them plugged in the sooner the pheromones will start entering the environment.<br>  <br>  Next you should do some scent exchanging.  Take a clean cloth and wipe it around the face of the new cat - where his scent glands are.  Then take the same cloth and wipe it around the face of your older cat and vice versa - the reason for doing this is that a cat will recognise SCENT before SIGHT and by exchanging their scent they will recognise each other as familiar and be more accepting of each other. Start carrying the new cat around with you and take him TO your female cat rather than forcing her into a room she does not want to go into.  When you can take your male cat to her without her hissing, throw down something tasty for them both to each such as some bits of chicken so that they associate being together as a good thing.  <br>  <br>  Your male cat will need to be put back into his own room when you are not around and at night for a while until you are absolutely sure that there is no fighting.  Please make sure they both have their own litter facilities (2 cats means 3 litter trays), feeding stations and cosy beds where they can go to be alone if they want to.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|EcdelIHtaa	i just adopted a cat about a week ago. She was doing the same thing it took her about 4 days to get comfortable with everything and everyone. Then her vet told us to give her some space and let her sniff around so she can get used to her new surroundings|`|V8TvIVJ8aa	you just have to let them be. they will get used to each other in time, or learn to avoid each other.|`|zpwJR60baa	There is this article on confinement form the SF SPCA... <br>  <br>  Hope this will help, instead of me typing this all up. It was from my colleague.  VERY helpful!
dqtcXOZwaa	There are a lot of things that you might want to try.  First, don't let your dog pull.  Keep the leash short.  Second, you might just want to cross the street when you see other dogs.  Get your dog into the idea that seeing other dogs doesn't mean he's going to get to "meet" them.<br>  <br>  Lightly hitting your dog under the chin is a good way to stop barking behavior.  Your dog needs to know that you are the alpha in the relationship.  Use a strong voice to tell your dog "NO" when he barks.  Most importantly, you need to assert yourself as the one with power in the relationship.  Sounds like your maltese has the power right now.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	he obviously was not socialized as a pup and you did not train him with distractions.|`|wqwupZHmaa	Well I agree with the other dude, you should have trained him when he was smaller. If he knows what the word bad means or bad dog try using that whenever he barks or pulls on the leash, and keep him close to your side so he has to walk to with you, and you can also get a muzzle thing that you put on so they when they try to pull there head goes sideways, its completely harmless to the dog but it keeps him from pulling on the leash, and if you have a muzzle on him he cant bark.

(I recommend Oxbow, a little more expensive, but top quality).|`|wsLngQ8oaa	that is really not an easy question to answer. Because there's the cost of fresh produce, and then the cost of the dry mix, and that depends on the kind and size of the bag.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It sounds like you really love your cat and are concerned about what you are observing. This is a good thing.  And in answer to your questions...<br>  <br>  It sure is time for a vet visit.  Cats only lose their baby teeth and not their "adult" teeth, which are permanent. Your cat's breath really  should not have a bad odor and not all cats have bad breath. But it  does sound like your kitty may have periodontal disease which needs veterinary attention as soon as possible to save her remaining teeth and treat her gums.<br>  <br>  For some excellent information about cats and dental concerns, check out  this great article. You may even want to print it for future reference and discussion with your vet.<br>  <a href="http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/dental.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sniksnak.com/cathealth/dental...</a><br>  <br>  Since cats really don't "chew" their food the same way that we do, since their teeth are designed for killing and tearing  prey when they hunt, cats are able to eat dry food with minimal chewing and you may not have realised that she had dental problems before she lost that tooth.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://zooclub.ru/eng/cats/uhod/10.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zooclub.ru/eng/cats/uhod/10.shtml</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Please make an appointment with your vet to have this checked out.

It sounds like your cats teeth are rotting and need care. I would schedule a cleaning with your vet, they can teach you how to brush your cats teeth and take care of them.  The dry food doesn't help your case, its not as good for cats as wet and does nothing to clean their teeth, contrary to what some people think.  Your kitty needs to see a vet.<br>  <br>  It is unlikely that they will replace the tooth, and as far as anasthesia is concerned, it depends how well behaved your cat is.  Most don't need it, but sometimes they will give them a mild sedative to calm them down to reduce the chances of the vet or tech getting bit.  You didn't know, so don't feel bad, but now that you do you can correct it.  Go take care of your little one :)|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Answering your addition since the first question is well covered... Yes, the vet will use anesthesia.  They'll scale her teeth and probably remove any bad ones immediately so she doesn't have to be knocked out again later.  (Because they don't know what they will find, they probably won't be able to give you a definite price in advance). Fillings and false teeth aren't generally used on cats.  They do very well with gums!  My cat has only a few teeth left at the front.  In spite of this she really enjoys a few pieces of dry food every day (she'd like more, but she's on mostly soft for her health!)|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	I think you should take her to the vet. My nine year old kitty has never lost a tooth, and likewise only eats dry food.|`|AA10394958	she has gum disease.<br>  <br>  it is not normal for a cat to ever loose there teeth.<br>  <br>  take her to the vet please.|`|wBbvGdkcaa	I've seen this before. The thing is, how did she loose her tooth? Did it just come out on its own, did she accidentally knock into something? Cats usually loose their teeth at 6-9 months, and if your cat is over that age then u must call your vet. This could be a serious problem and it causes eating problems and pain in the mouth. So if I were u, i would get off this website now and call your vet.<br>  <br>  Good Luck To You And Your Cat! :)<br>  <br>  P.S. I dont really think a fake tooth is necessary, but it's not my cat! :)
Rpj9qArgaa	She will stop eating, lay around more however, some dogs get more restless. I would have the dog put down as soon as she seems uncomfortable. I know its hard but it really is for the best. What does the vet say?<br>  <br>  END STAGE is the key term here. There is no cure for End Stage|`|o93EwErKaa	Have you looked into this supplement?  I have seen it mentioned with positive results on a few message boards.  I didn't hear about it before my dog with Cushing's passed.  I was treating her with Anipryl because I decided lysoderm was too poisonous for her to handle and didn't want to risk death by the treatment.  She was diagnosed at 8 and lived until 12 years old and died of congestive heart failure which I believe was unrelated to the cushings.  Her appetite and activitiy level were always good.  Constant hunger was really her main symptom.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petprohealth.com/Dog_Cushings_Disease_Y.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petprohealth.com/Dog_Cushings...</a>|`|KxjUim7yaa	Cushing's:<br>  increased drinking,urine,increased food cravings, panting,high Blood Pressure, hair loss, skin infection, and diabetic.<br>  <br>  If it is a tumor of the adrenal gland it can be removed.

M3pjhIecaa	From the start<br>  The tank needs to cycle, this is where the bacteria convert fish waste/waste from ammonia to Nitrite, ammonia is extremely toxic to fish, then Nitrite is converted to Nitrate, Nitrite again is extremely toxic. Nitrate is less toxic but even so in concentrated amount toxic, of course live plants would use this as food, but of course the easiest solution to this is to remove 25pct of the water at least every two weeks so diluting it. <br>  The cloudiness you are seeing is the growing bacteria bloom that will do the above process. <br>  Your shop should have warned you about this and when you went back they should have been aware of what was happening and again told you. The fact they didn't would have me running a mile. <br>  The cloudiness will clear as a balance is reached, Don't add any more fish however every couple of days add a small amount of food to the filter. <br>  You need to get a test kit with Ph, Ammonia, No2 and No3, <br>  once the cycling is complete, ammonia should be zero and nitrite (No2)should be zero, nitrate(No3) should be below 30 ppm the lower the better, you can again add fish but only a couple they retest and wait for the same readings to come up and add again keep doing this until you have your full stock. <br>  Measure the tank back to front and then times by the length this will give you the surface area of the tank, as a guide its 12sq inch per inch of fish however, if you stick to fish like neons you can halve that to 6sq in, remembering this is in relation to the potential size and not the size they are when you buy them. <br>  Lastly change shops anyone that moves fish without quarantining there stock will cause you immense problems, I can forgive inexperienced advice but these lot appear to be complete muppets that just want your money and have no clue about anything else other than selling you anything.|`|7HxJvbjMaa	Running a tank for 24 hours doesn't leach out chemicals.<br>  You need to properly cycle the tank which takes several weeks. Not just running it either... you need to seed it with ammonia to get the process started.<br>  Now your guppies have added the ammonia via their waste but they will have to go through the stressful process of cycling.<br>  Cloudy water means the process is going along. To keep the rest of your fish alive you'll need to do daily partial water changes. Make sure you are treating your water to remove chlorine/chloramine. Do not replace the filter, thats where the good bacteria grow.<br>  Buy some test kits for ammonia, nitrite and nitrate. Test daily until you hit the magic number - zero.<br>  Read: <a href="http://faq.thekrib.com/begin-cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://faq.thekrib.com/begin-cycling.htm...</a>|`|27bc701367843ae2833d9bcda8c0f992aa	you did not let it run long enough<br>  you need to have it run 4-6 weeks<br>  and you stocked it too quickly<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb when you have you tank cycled<br>  1 gallon pf water per fish.<br>   Now I have a 29 gallon but it has rock caves, gravel and other things that take up space.  so the 29 actual has about 26 gallons of water.<br>  <br>  You need to know how many actual gallons of water you have so you don't over stock the tank <br>  <br>  the amount of fish you have can have NO LESS than 8 gallons of water.  when your tank is cycled.  and broken in.  this takes about a year to final get it set up <br>  <br>  Look for fish breeders or stores that only deal in fish.<br>  the big box pet stores are usual typhoid Marys.

The living conditions that they keep their animals in are atrocious. Your fish probably died because they had some sort of disease lead by living in those conditions.<br>  <br>  Go to a family owned petstore instead. Go to youtube and type in "pestmart animal cruelty".<br>  <br>  Anyways. You need to make sure that your water parameters are stable enough to sustain a fish so you would need to cycle your tank before you get any more fish. This is called the nitrogen cycle and it means that the filter media and some areas of the tank need to sustain good bacteria in order to accommodate fish waste. The cloudyness in the water is actually a bacterial bloom which shows the start of your cycle. NEVER 100 percent change the water in your tank because then you will have to start all over again with the cycle. When you put your fish in the tank, you should never put the water in the tank that was in the bag. You should use a fish net to gently take them out.<br>  <br>  Please read up on the nitrogen cycle and how it works so your fish can live happily and healthy.
6LMeXaTeaa	Although it may be difficult, take him/her out as many times as you can, perhaps once every hour or so. If he goes, make sure that you reward him with praise and a treat. Eventually, as I did with my puppy, teach him a signal to show you when he has to go out. My dog ( now 6 months) either whines or scratches at the back door when he has to go outside.<br>                   Hope this helps!|`|NAGiNKFWaa	You take him outside and scold him, and in your mind you taught him something, and in the puppies mind you taught him outside is the place he never wants to go again.  You have to think like a puppy.  You don't mention the puppies age, so the bladder isn't grown until 6-months-old, and they are not fully potty trained until 1-year-old.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop..  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|OFpl236faa	It sounds like you are stressing him out (why he is pottying more in the house). You should look up crate training a puppy. You don't want to use the kennel as a bad place or punishment. It is a place for you pup to go when you can not be watching him. You need to take him out more often and reward him for going outside. If you are in the house and can keep an eye on him, then he can be out or tied to you. This way you can look for the signs that he needs to go out. If you can't watch him, then he is in his crate. He should also sleep in his crate to help prevent night time accidents. Also, take food and water away around 8 PM so that everything is out of his system. Always take him out after naps and meals. Be consistent and try to get him on a schedule.|`|6J0XbJu2aa	there is no point scolding him outside that is where he should do his Business the best way to potty train him is put him/her on a lead/leash and take him outside and don't go back in until he/she does it, when he/she does it you say good dog and give him a treat trust me we have got the same problem with my puppy we are taking him outside and let him do his Business and sooner or later he/she will get the hang of going outside and if you can get him/she a bell and some string to attach to the door and he/she will ring it if he/she wants to go out.<br>  <br>  hope that helped :)|`|FaPrr8bbaa	Time to take puppy outside and play, run and throw toys to get puppy real worked up, this stimulates potty.  Now take a break still outside and before you know it, puppy does his business,  Now play more, always end potty time with happy play. So pup will look forward to that whole routine with you WITH YOU WITH YOU  never alone.|`|s76aC4G8aa	Ok the dog will NEVER be housebroken if you continue training the way you are.  NEVER scold the dog all you are doing is reinforcing this behavior, you are making him afraid to potty infront of you out of fear of being punished for making a mess, so he won't potty.  Why are you putting him in his kennel as punishment.  Not only are you ruining housebreaking but you're also ruining crate training.  Two wrongs will never make a right.<br>  <br>  Read how to housebreak a dog.  Follow the instructions carefully and to the letter.  Never punish when he has an accident, that's YOUR fault not his, NEVER put him in his crate or he'll associate it with a negative feeling and will never want to go in it anymore.  Housebreaking is all about prevention and not punishment.  You aren't training him in a way he understands so he will never learn. <br>  <br>  You must use positive reinforcement using treats and praise, you must IGNORE when he goes in the house and you must be consistent in your training and most of all patient.  You must show him what pleases you and treats will do that, ignoring accidents inside will do that.<br>  <br>  Follow these directions and you'll have the dog housebroken in no time.  STOP with the methods you are using now completely, you've seen they don't work, try positive reinforcement training and this dog will figure it out sooner or later but he's got to learn that he's not going to get smacked any more for pottying so since you've done that it'll take a little while for him to catch on again.  Don't give up.|`|VYPblEgnaa	crate training seriously. get a crate that is just big enough for your puppy to stand up....turn around and lay down in. when you cant keep a eye on him put him in there. dogs will not deficate in their sleeping quarters (which is what the crate would be to him) and let him out every 1 to 2 hours and take him directly outside and wait til he uses the bathroom. reward him with nice words and some playtime. whenever he eats or drinks take him outside afterward to use the bathroom and once again reward him with kind words, affection and play. do this everytime and he will very soon know he is expected to go outside. good luck!|`|pSX5stBHaa	Good answers so far.<br>  Consistency is the key to potty training.  It takes time and patience, especially for an abused dog. Negativity never works and in this case will surely not work.  Your pup needs to be a proud and happy pup.<br>  When crate training, remember that your pup should have just enough room to stand up and turn around.  Your pup should NOT live in its crate and should not be used for punishment.<br>  For specific instructions please visit www.goldenrottie.blogspot.com and look up potty training.|`|39c447368835b3bdd35784dc6615155daa	You have to watch the pup constantly.  When they start to sniff or assume the stance, take the dog or (in some more drastic cases) pick the dog up, and carry them on their back, since about 95% of dogs will not go on themselves (they like to be clean after all).  Yelling at them isn't necessarilly good, and smacking them doesn't work very well.  Mostly you're both confusing the dog who just really needed to go potty, smacking him doesn't teach him location!  <br>  <br>  So... Carry them outside and praise them like they just made gold when they go.  If they don't, after about 5-10 minutes, take 'em back inside, but the moment they try to go again you take 'em outside. Eventually they'll have to go outside, and once they realize that they're not allowed to go inside they'll start holding it.  The only trick is, unless you teach the dog to let you know when it needs to go out (whining, barking, tapping a bell), you're going to have to schedule times of day in which its taken outside dogs (puppies especially) love routine.
DtkLsetkaa	Cats get soooo stressed out by travel, this would probably be a good idea, but be sure you consult with your vet AND the airline to see if its allowed.  Your vet needs to hook you up with the prescription,  but the airline may not allow sedated pets to travel on it, due to safety regulations.  But as long as both say its ok, I think its a good idea.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Ask your vet what you can use to sedate your cat.  My vet recommended I use Dramamine, and OTC drug for humans, 1/2 a pill before leaving home.  I had to move two very valuable cats, and one of them was pregnant.  Our flight was approximately 2 hours, and they were both 'healthy and happy' when we got where we were going, so that all I had to do was open the door to their 'flight cage' and they got their leashes on and walked out of the airport as if they flew all the time.  These were show Siamese, though ... so ask your vet, who should be familiar with your cat and know all of his 'problems' well enough to give you the 'proper answer' since not all cats can take the same sedatives!|`|QLopvWKDaa	Yes- I would consider sedating him. <br>  <br>  Remember that it takes awhile for it to work, so give him the medication an hour or so before you begin the trip. Of course, the vet would be the best to advise you.<br>  <br>  I once sedated my cat for an 1 1/2hour car ride, only to have her screaming and freaked the whole ride- when we arrived she jumped out of the car, tipped over on the lawn and then slept for 3 hours! lol|`|A8k9NHigaa	yeah when I took a four hour flight my vet gave my cat a cpl of pills to tak it was like kitty valium, that way she was drowsy the whole trip and slept pretty much the whole time, and she road in her carrier with me on board.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Yes I would, else he'll be beside himself.|`|CfpkOo5Oaa	Yes, that way he will sleep calmly throughout the ride. <br>  =)<br>  <br>  and u wont hear him/her freaking out lolz|`|Drnpe4T5aa	No!!!!<br>  We brought our cats with us overseas and they flew with us.<br>  My vet said that when you sedate an animal, it can't properly cool or heat itself.  So, depending on the time of year you are speaking of, your cat could encounter warm conditions as well as cooler/cold conditions that he would benefit being able to actively respond to.  Especially up in the air, in the luggage area where they put the animals, it is not temperature controlled as it is in the cabin.  Pressurized, yes - but not going to be heated and cooled as needed.  <br>  My cats also were not happy car-passengers, but they did ok with their flights (both there and back, twice)  My vocal guy meowed himself hoarse, but aside from that, they did just fine.  Your guy will, too.  :)<br>  EDIT:  There is a natural remedy that you put (in drop form) on their bald spots by their ears, called Relax-Eze or something similar.  It's available at most natural nutrition stores, is in a brown glass vial with black dropper top and a blue label.  It's a human product, but prescribed by my vet (and deemed safe for cat use - 1-2 drops a couple times a day) who specializes in natural homeopathic remedies in addtion to traditional western medicine.  It can't hurt to try it.  There are also calming pheremone sprays you can put on a towel in your cat's carrier.<br>  As a note - for our longer flight, we used a medium dog kennel, with a bed on one end and a smaller, kitten-sized potty box on the other so our cats could move around and not have to potty in the place where they sleep.  It costs more, as you pay for the space you take up - but I felt like our cats were more comfortable that way...|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	I somewhat agree with Jennifer V. I think I have heard that about them not being able to regulate their body temperature. I had a friend that moved cross country a few times and she had to sedate her cat on the trips and he didn't take to it well, she eventually did some research and discovered something that was all natural or herbal that worked perfectly. I'm sorry I don't know what it was though and I no longer am in contact with her so I can't find out. Try going to your local Petco or something and see what they have. I know there is a spray or something out there that has a calming effect on cats that's made specifically for that purpose.|`|kJX632msaa	Talk to your vet prior.  Sometimes cats (just like humans) have bad reactions to medication.  If they haven't taken it before, and you give them something when you won't be there to watch for problems, it could turn out bad.<br>  <br>  I don't like giving my cats anything they don't need.  They have been on 2 five hour flights, and although they didn't like it too much, they were perfectly fine once we got home.|`|M8X0dIOZaa	Yes, it will be better for him not to be awake through the flight. Make sure he doesn't have food or water for at least 12 hours before sedating him.|`|RFcFQoC0aa	if the cat normally does ok in vehicle rides it might not be necessary, be case when the sedation wears off and hes in a new place it can upset him a lot|`|JsiELu6xaa	yea, i dont see how it could be a bad thing. The cat will probably be happier that way.|`|AA11293619	2.5 hours isn't that long. try placing him in a covered cage. he might go to sleep on his own|`|yIBSIgoCaa	yes he will have a lovely sleep

DtkLsetkaa	Its probably your reaction when she brings it back :)  She loves to see how happy and thrilled it makes you!!  That is SUCH a talent you should be very proud!!  My Dexter plays fetch, but I knew few other cats that do it, its a nifty trick tho and you should be very happy you have a unique way of playing with your cat!!|`|CbL4ybdLaa	My sweet Ruby will play fetch all day....that is if you keep throwing her mouse.|`|cj31x3UMaa	Boy have you got something to learn! Your cat does NOT fetch... it has cleverly trained you to throw!<br>  <br>  Yes lots of owners are similarly trained, sometimes to the point where we hide the favorite toy when we get tired.  I had one that started out stripping small plastic leaves off a fake tree & bringing them to me. Bought her a plastic rose & she finally left the tree alone, would carry this long stemmed rose everywhere & bring it to us when she wanted to play. Wish I had pictures!|`|htD82ij1aa	I've never seen a cat play fetch, that's pretty special, my cat will pick up milk rings, but i never get her to bring them back.  sometimes cats will do things that surprise you, I have three cats and i haven't tried to toilet train any of them and yet the youngest one of them pees in the toilet and we don't know why.|`|QRBi7feQaa	the cats play fetch it normal hunting instincts plus it actually teaches them socialization skills and builds up their hearing vision capabilities if they r young|`|jy9Jn0Xoaa	I don't know if its normal but its definitely not abnormal. A cat I used to have (Ginger) used to play fetch all the time. Of the three cats I now have my Misty loves to play fetch. You cant even crumple up a piece of paper to throw away without her racing in from whatever room she happens to be in and then meowing away for you to throw it for her. If you should happen to make the mistake of not wanting to play and throw it into a small wastebasket without a lid or the recycle bag she will dig it out and bring it to you to throw for her. The only problem with playing fetch with her is that the first time you throw the paper or crumpled up tinfoil she will bring it back and drop it at your feet. The second time she drops it like two feet away, it progressively gets further away till it's like 10 feet away from you. If you choose to ignore her well that is unacceptable so she will come over and tap your leg with her little paw. It's like she is saying "since I am getting some exercise well you must get some also". Also you must throw the item she is fetching into the kitchen where there is linoleum where it can be batted around awhile before its brought back to you, throwing it across the living room onto carpet is unacceptable. The game goes on until eventually the "toy" ends up under the fridge or the stove. You will know where it is though when you go into the kitchen and you see her looking under the appropriate appliance and trying to fish it out with one of her paws. If you choose to leave it there so you can have a break thats ok but she will remember where it is and the next day you will see her looking and fishing for it.|`|X5DHQxHiaa	Some cats fetch, and many come when you call. Siamese cats are usually the easiest even sometimes allowing themselves to be walked on a leash.

KEYgd73saa	Unless you've got a microwave that can turn the temperature up to a couple thousand degrees, no, it won't do a thing but warm it up a bit.  Phosban and similarly adsorptive products (like activated carbon) will under only the most extreme conditions release what they've adsorbed (different than absorption).  It's a one-time deal, though it usually lasts 1-3 months.

cPO5ApCQaa	If there is blood, she is definitely ill. Take her to the vet again. Urgently. I don't know how tight on money you are, nor do I now if you live in the UK or in America. I only know what you could do in the UK. So, she has to go to the vet immediately. If you can't pay the bill, ask the RSPCA for help, or Cats Protection or any one of your local cat charities. Then, get insurance for her. You can get it as cheap as 6 GBP. It can save you thousands, if your cat gets ill. Unfortunately, it is to late to get her current illness covered. But get her insured straight away, please. And ask the charities for help. You could think of doing some work for them in return. <br>  All the best wishes for your cat.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	If there is blood in her urine, she clearly has something wrong with her urinary tract.

I am very suspicious with your vet.  if you informed me there is drops of blood after pee... there is a blood clutter in the bladder, can be more then UTI.

A lot of other vet offer payment plans...<br>  <br>  Their are cat who does not like their litter brand, and changing the litter helps or keep it real clean.

I from the other side would appreciate know how my dogs behave when I am not home. Consider just mentioning the barking about when they are gone. Like "Hey how are you doing? (chit chat, chit chat) you know your dogs go crazy when you leave. In my experience they may have separation anxiety" and recommend them a site or printed article on the matter so it seems like your concern is with the dogs and not your self. or just call a/c either way it depends on if you dont want a crappy relationship with them or not.|`|6MpoAh6Aaa	Hi!<br>  I know how you must feel... It must be very very annoying. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't take such extreme measures as to calling the police or consulting the law just yet. Maybe they don't notice that it is a problem. Maybe they don't mind the barking and don't know that others are being bothered by it. Try talking to them first. I know how much you really want to write hate mail to them, but that would make you look like the bad guy in the situation. So, what you can do is visit them, just start a friendly conversation, maybe lead on to a topic slightly relevant to dogs, night, sleep, or anything having to do with the situation. Then you can mention the problems with the dogs: "Hey, I really love your dogs!! But, its just that at night, I sort of have a hard time sleeping because they really bark loud! (say with a smile) And sometimes during the day I have a hard time concentrating because of the barks... Would you do me a big favour? Thanks so much... Its just that maybe you could try to keep them from barking, or at least so loud... Maybe you could try keeping them inside the house? Thank you so much!!!!" Try to say thank you with a lot of gratitude, like you really appreciate it (which you probably will). Make it sound nice and polite, and keep it sweet. Make it sort of like you just thought about it, and you know... <br>  <br>  I'm sure your neighbour will understand. If they continue to let their dogs bark, THEN you can call the police or check what the law is in your region about noise. Plus, you DID ask them and you TOLD them that it was a problem, so if the police come, they don't really have much of an excuse. <br>  Or if you don't want to call the police just yet as it would cause some "neighbourly hate", you can ask others on your street if it is bothering them. If they CAN hear it, then you can all come and ask your neighbour together. But I'm sure that they will stop once you have asked them alone...<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!!!<br>   Bye! (Hope I helped!!!!!)<br>  From,<br>  Mrs. Isabella Marie Cullen (Bella ;D)|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	You can report it. If the dogs are barking 24-7 that neglect from the owner.

Invite them over and say something like "I love your dogs, but they are a bit noisy. I can't sleep and it's affecting me physically and emotiionally. Can you please do something about this?" and so on and so forth. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|Drnpe4T5aa	Call your local sheriff or police non-emergency line<br>  If the barking is occuring after, say, 9 or 10 pm, many cities have noise ordinances in place.  A barking dog voilates those.  Even if the dog is barking during the day, many cities have rules about how long a dog can be barking before it is considered a nuisance. <br>  You could also try talking to your neighbor, in case they are not aware that the barking is a problem.  I think many times people with dogs that bark get so used to it, that they just tune it out.  It's not meant as an insult.  Many of us with children do the same over sibling squabbles.  ;)<br>  However, keep i nmind that if you approach your neighbor, nothing happens and *then* you call the law, they will totally know it's you that called, which can make for some neighborly tension.<br>  Good luck to you!<br>  Added:  Very interesting that they acquired these full-grown big dogs, only to leave them outside all the time...  Up here in the USA's icebox, we have to sign an agreement when adopting animals that they will not be left out.  Dogs like to be with their people.  Of course they are going to bark if just tossed outside and ignored.  <br>  I personally feel that, unless you have a warm, friendly relationship with your neighbors that is strong enough to weather this sort of conflict, you are better off letting the authorities take care of it - it's their job, and it clears you from  any nasty tension.  If you do have a great relationship with them... do you really want to risk upsetting it?  They are obviously aware of the problem.  You are not doing them or the dogs any favors by ignoring it.  But that's just my opinion...
AA12128656	my large shelter for my dogs is mobile... it's the couch in my living room.<br>  <br>  seriously, the dogs should sleep inside.  if they are out to play for the day in their covered kennel you can just give them a simple dog house. i actually found some wonderful ones at the dump made of plastic with foam inside to insulate. they even fold up to store! my dogs sleep in my bedroom though, so they think the dog houses are just places to hide their toys and play peek-a-boo!<br>  <br>  the chih can be crated in a large crate with the food, or in a seperate room from the other dog who will scarf it all down. or, you can construct a HEAVY box (immovable to the big dog) with a hole big enough for only the chih to get into. maybe if you put carpeting on the top, it could double for a dog bed?|`|kvHqnR5Haa	How about you move into the shelter and they take the house.

What cut would look good may depend on if he has a pekignese coat, a poodle coat, or an in-between coat.<br>  <br>  How long it will take for the coat to grow depends on genetics, how short it is now, how long you want it, care you give the coat, diet, etc.|`|5rfnEQnGaa	Impossible to say with a crossbreed how they will look.|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	this is a poorly bred mixed breed of a poor quality poodle and a pekinese... you have no idea how the coat will grow .... it cannot be predicted in mutts. you will have to waait and see.
DEdtNBBSaa	Well I wouldn't discount hyperthyroidism.  Even if its not severe, he may be suffering from the condition.  You may find the article below helpfu;/|`|AQsiugSpaa	Hi Michael,<br>  <br>  Your cat is obese. Most average size housecats of "no breed" weigh between 10-12 lbs.  He needs to be seen a vet to evaluate the cause of his weight gain, and a possible diet plan if there is no underlying medical condition. <br>  <br>  If you let your cat gain more weight he will be in serious trouble, and at high risk for heart disease, liver disease, kidney disease and diabetes. That he is demanding water to that extent is a signal that something is amiss, whether it be from the faucet or from the water bowl. I do hope you are cleaning that water bowl out daily and providing fresh clean water at least once a day.<br>  <br>  Without a veterinary evaluation, you are basically spinning your wheels about what could be wrong. Even if you listed all the symptoms, no one here could definitively say what is ailing your kitty.<br>  <br>  An oily dry coat is another symptom that needs professional evaluation. The diet he is receiving now may not be giving him all the essential nutrition that he needs.<br>  <br>  While there is a great deal of controversy here on Yahoo Answers about good nutrition and dry vs canned food, please take a moment to visit this excellent article on feline nutrition written by an expert veterinarian.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thensome.com/drjean/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thensome.com/drjean/</a><br>  <br>  Most vets receive very little training, if any, on this most important aspect of feline care, and most of it is supplied by Hills, in an effort to have vets prescribe their products and stock their shelves with what is actually very poor quality food for cats.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best with your kitty, and that you quickly get to the bottom of the problem.

If you're that knowledgeable about the effects of alcohol on dogs then #1 - why would leave that crap laying around for the dog to get into, and #2 - the dog would take one sniff and walk away from it like most people who have half a brain would do.  That stuff causes DEATH to people who don't understand what it does to the body - no joke.   FYI - Beer & whiskey have flavor to attract animals to it - Everclear smells like rubbing alcohol - it is NOT attractive, especially to an animal with such a keen sense of smell.   This is a B.S. story.<br>  EDIT:   When you worded that your dog "got into my everclear" you made no mention of it being in Jell-O, which is a DEADLY combination for people, by the way.  Do some research on this alcohol - it is illegal in many states due to it's high alcohol content and destroys brain cells (along with livers), which seems to be true in your case or you wouldn't have left it laying around mid-week for your dog to get into.  I stand by my first answer...this is a b.s. story.|`|V5Ib9BCsaa	your dog will be fine. one time we had a party and everyone left cups outside and my dog knocked them over and drank them and chewed through plastic bottles with alcohol in them and he was fine a bit drunk but fine. im suprised mine didnt get alchohol poisoning.<br>  to the guy that said they wont even drink wine is wrong. mine happends to have a fondness for whiskey. my husband was drunk one night and poured a strong nasty drink and didnt want it so he gave it to the dog. he loved it..............|`|M8X0dIOZaa	2 shots for a 55 lb dog probably isn't vet visit worthy. He's likely drunk and will likely not feel good for a while. Give him some food and pour water over it to help his system process the alcohol. It's not good for dogs but that little just once probably won't hurt him. If it keeps happening he could have liver damage. After he eats try to get him to lie down a while.|`|XCzpQvDvaa	We give my friends dog beer all the time and he loves it, i wouldnt worry about it the dog will either puke it up or sleep it off, they drink worse things than alcohol.<br>  And anyone that thinks a dog shouldnt drink beer well i can see your side of the argument...but the dog doesn't seem to mind|`|KuorZ1a9aa	how the hell did he get to alcohol in the first place you DRUNK!!!!<br>  <br>  well TAKE HIM TO VET <br>  works 99% of the time<br>  <br>  oh well I say don't worry he is just drunk watch him through he will bump into stuff maybe throw up<br>  works 2% of the time|`|AA10377289	2 shots? and how did you know its exactly 2 shots? how can you not have access to vehicle? were you drinking with your dog? call your vet!!! not here in computer!|`|HgMFrllLaa	If it was 2 shots only, the dog can still drive.<br>  Late Entry : whatever "everclear" may be, at 95% NO dog would even sniff it.|`|Qb7w4qdfaa	Even if you can't get to the vet, you can call one. Call and ask them what to do.|`|XpEQBuQ0aa	EMERGENCY U SHOULD GO TO THE VET! NOT THE COMPUTER
wLgGD63raa	If your male and female Leo's are still in the same tank, I suggest you separate them, because it definitely sounds to me that your female is very stressed, and that is why she is not eating. It is not always a good idea to house males and females together, especially if you do not want them breeding or if you have no idea how to breed properly. Leopard Geckos are solitary animals in the wild, and they like it that way. Your female is obviously uncomfortable being in the same "house" as your male, and she would very much appreciate having her own space. It would be very wise for you to separate them.<br>  <br>  Also, when you are housing two geckos together, it is sometimes difficult to monitor which one is eating and going to the bathroom. Your female may have stopped eating long before you noticed. A lot of times, males terrorize their female counterparts and like to hog the food to show that they are the dominant gender. <br>  <br>  Knowing this, I hope you decide to separate your geckos as soon as possible, and I hope your female begins eating again soon! Good luck with everything!|`|kSIxfA1Raa	Sorry, but im not sure how quick leopard geckos grow, if she is big enough for a pinky id go with that. im sure she would enjoy a little pinky mouse. Get one that is pre killed and frozen, then thaw it out in warm water, and feed her that. If she wont take the pinky try poking a hole in the pinkys head so the lizard can smell the brain fluids (gross, but effective.)<br>  <br>  Good luck!
tT256JQRaa	you cant feed her only waxworms. that would effectively be like you eating nothing but lard.<br>  you shouldnt rush into breeding - you should take care of her properly so that she is healthy enough to breed.<br>  <br>  feed her crickets, locusts, mealworms and the occasional waxworm, or even a pinkie mouse (rarely) if she is big enough and she'll gain enough weight in her own time. if you force her to grow using just waxworms she will almost certainly get ill, and will have next to no energy. you have to make sure she has a good diet to be healthy, and calcium is just as, if not more, important than fat, so make sure you dust the insects regularly|`|wLgGD63raa	No, your Leopard Gecko cannot eat only wax worms. Wax worms are only to be given as a treat, and only up to two (2) times a MONTH. Wax worms are very high in fat, and they are very addicting, so please do not start feeding your Leo wax worms regularly. She will probably expect them if you do, and may refuse to eat something else. Since they are so high in fat, they have no nutritious value, and therefore they are a poor choice for your Leo's dietary needs.<br>  <br>  This also goes for pinkie mice. ONLY BREEDING FEMALES (AFTER SHE HAS LAID HER EGGS) SHOULD BE GIVEN A PINKY MOUSE! They are too high in fat to be fed in a normal diet, and really don't need to be given as a treat. Stick with wax worms for treats.
8i90ov0Gaa	Most breeders I know breed their females when they are at least 1200 grams. Males can breed at 500 grams. Of course with both, bigger is better, just as Quiet Tempest said. I have heard of females laying fertile eggs at 800 or 900 grams, but this isn't recommended.|`|b94588139eda1c69ea59fe863af53826aa	smallest i have heard for males is 600, females should be atleast 1000 i have heard people breeding them at 900 but its really not worth the risk if you ask me, 1500 or larger are what most recommend|`|EDOxXdcoaa	1500 grams would be the minimum, in my opinion, for females. 2000 grams or more would be ideal. <br>  <br>  Males can be bred as early as 400 grams but you'll have better success at at least 800 grams.
w2R6SpHqaa	Just sit with her and pet her|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Give her a nice long walk around your neighborhood.

uBFhKXgHaa	Go with a high quality one.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/</a> (RawFed)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com/</a> (Jane Anderson's Raw Learning Site)<br>  <a href="http://rawfeddogs.net/" rel="nofollow">http://rawfeddogs.net/</a> (Raw Fed Dogs)<br>  <a href="http://www.rawmeatybones.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawmeatybones.com/</a> (Raw Meaty Bones)<br>  <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/preymodel.html</a> (Raw Prey Model Diet Vs.

YnCUyvK7aa	When a fluorescent bulb first starts up, it needs more energy to light up than it does to keep itself running.  The ballast is what controls the energy first sent to the bulb compared to what's sent later.<br>  <br>  So they help save the lifetime of your bulb by not giving it too much energy and having it burn out too fast and it saves you money by cutting back on the electricity used.<br>  <br>  At least, that's my understanding of what they do.

VMY7No0eaa	hey everyone... he's from Morroco! not the US... no walmart! and possibly no vets. <br>  <br>  here is a recipe for kitten milk...<br>  I get a small bottle with a nipple that looks like V instead of a U.  easier for them to eat from.<br>  Here is a recipe for the kitten milk you can make....and how to make them go to the bathroom.<br>  Make sure to bring them inside the house so a TOM won't kill them and you can keep them warm... they MUST be fed every 2 hours. <br>  so if you can't do it find someone who will.<br>  if you can find a lactating mother cat she will adopt them.<br>  good luck <br>  *****************<br>  ORPHAN KITTEN FORMULA<br>  4 oz. evaporated milk<br>  4 oz. water<br>  2 egg yolks<br>  1 teaspoon corn syrup (or substitute pancake syrup)<br>  1 capsule cod liver oil<br>  *REFRIGERATE any unused formula and make fresh formula if all not used within 48 hours.<br>  FEEDING:<br>  Warm formula but make sure it’s not too hot ! Use a plastic feeding tube – a 3 cc size is best but you can use a 1 cc size and you can obtain a tube from a vet or pharmacy. Orphan kittens need to be fed every 2 – 3 hours until they are 4 weeks old. At 4 weeks old, you can introduce some canned cat food mixed with the baby kitten formula but supplement with the feeding tube until all kittens are fully able to eat enough on their own. They should be weighed on a kitchen scale each day and their weight recorded in order to make sure they are gaining. Consult a veterinarian if the kittens fail to gain weight, have diarrhea, continually vomit or sneeze. <br>  ELIMINATION:<br>  Orphan kittens need help to eliminate their bowels until they are 3 – 4 weeks old, after which time they will begin to eliminate on their own. Until that time, after EACH feeding, use a warm, soft cloth and gently tap or rub their anal area until they pee/poop. This action simulates the mother’s rough tongue washing which, in a natural situation, helps her kittens eliminate. Be careful not to rub too hard as the skin is very tender on their rear ends when they are tiny kittens. <br>  SAFE CARE<br>  All baby kittens should be kept warm and out of a draft in a cardboard box in a safe area away from small children, dogs or other animals. All interaction with small children should be supervised as tiny kittens are very vulnerable to stress and handling. <br>  Kittens eyes will usually open around between 10 and 13 days after birth. <br>  <br>  NEW KITTY MOTHERS.<br>  Some new kitties do not know what to do with their babies.<br>  You HAVE TO HOLD THEM DOWN and MAKE them nurse their babies. <br>  <br>  Do not feed cats milk<br>  Fancy Feast Kitten food contains milk!|`|FC5BxnoPaa	Can you buy kitten replacement milk from Walmart?

If you use it correctly it is the best way to housebreak and to give your dog a safe place to go and be safe when you are not at home.  <br>  <br>  Think about leaving a toddler alone to rummage through the house......|`|d5c5079cce04b42e4018f3cce72b99f2aa	The big thing that some people forget about crate training is, as the other people have said is that dogs are den animals.  Their crate should become their 'safe" place.  When you first bring your puppy home, just have the crate door open so they can check it out.  Make sure you have a nice old blanket or towel in there so they can be comfy.  If they don't see it as a place they get put to be punished, they'll go in there just because they can, not because they have to.  My dog is happy in her crate and all I have to do to get her in it is say "Crate" and she's off like a shot.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	You should never crate a young puppy for more than a few hours. That's not a long time. It keeps the puppy safe and helps with potty training. An appropriate sized crate will become like a den to the pup and he'll enjoy being in there. My Husky mix goes and lays in her crate sometimes just because she wants too. She also sleeps in there even though I leave the door open now.|`|KxjUim7yaa	The crate is the den and safe place for the puppy. It will spend most of it's time sleeping because it is still a baby. There can be toys and items to chew. Sure playing outside with your puppy is great. They need exercise as well as good food and water. Until potty trained, running around in the house is not advised.|`|p7swtBYzaa	You don't keep a puppy contained "for so long" - you just crate him when you can't watch him, you take him out a LOT.<br>  <br>  Letting a pup run around the yard unsupervised is dangerous and will not get him potty trained.

But if the puppy is sleeping, they can go for HOURS. <br>  <br>  <br>  Puppys who are in a proper size crate for them will not poop or pee in their sleeping area. They need a walk before they go in, and they are fine for up to 8 hours. Make sure you take them outside once they come out of their sleeping area.<br>  <br>  Anyone who is saying that crate training is cruel is ignorant and blind to the fact that people dont need dog sh*t and pis* all over their house. They also are blind that leaving a puppy alone in any environment can be dangerous, as they are very curious guys and will want to get into everything.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	They should only be kenneled at night or when they are going to be left unattended for a short period of time in the house. Having them in a create all day while you are at work I believe is cruel and should not be done. But in my experience crate training makes preventing accidents and potty training much easier for small dogs...Big dogs are big enough to be left in a backyard and I don't like the idea of crating big dogs plus big dogs don't have accidents in the house as adults as little dogs tend to.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	As you have read, crating a puppy is for safety.<br>  <br>   A new puppy that has come to you at 8 weeks or so needs to be cared for by soemone else while you are at work for 8 hours - I usually recommend a pet sitting visit at around 10 AM and 2 PM, if you will get home around 5. Sometimes you can find a petsitter who will take the puppy with them between 10 and 2, or some part of the day, and alternate between having the puppy in a crate in the car, and taking them out to visit, with them holding the puppy a lot.<br>  <br>    Your instincts are correct - 8 hours amounts to incarceration.  But even that is safer than ever allowing any puppy to roam around any part of your house, looking for dangerous things to do.  <br>  <br>    It does sound as if you know to make other plans however - try your vet's office for a puppy sitter, as many vet techs actually moonlight doing that.  If they don't have any openings, they would know who the good pet sitters are in your area.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I tried to do this without the crate but the puppy got out of control she did not know what was allowed & what was not.  That was a long time ago. Last October I adopted a 9 month old Pedigree Whippet puppy who had been house trained using a crate (like you I thought it was cruel) but to me it is now the preferred method.  When you are out the puppy is safely crated & your house is not being trashed or covered with poop.  When you are home & the puppy has it's freedom & it is tired it will just crawl into it's crate & go to sleep.  It is not cruel we no longer use the crate at my house but we still get the odd poop accident when I'm not in the room & she cannot wait.  <br>  <br>  Personally I would buy a fleecy bed (easily washable) for the base, a warm blanket to snuggle under, a few toys, something to chew, a blanket to cover the top of the crate at all times so puppy has no fear of things landing on her from above & most important of all something that belongs to you that is no longer required so that she can snuggle up with it & feel safe.  Good luck & enjoy the experience.  Remember it takes quite a while to train a puppy.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Crate training is good for the lazy owner, not so good for the dog. So called experts have kept this myth going. In Europe studies have shown that excessive crating can cause high stress levels resulting in physical and mental health problems.<br>  <br>  A puppy should be trained to stay in a crate for a short period of time so it can be transported to the Vet for example, but the "dog in a box" way of raising a puppy is unnecessary and can create more problems than it solves.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	What were you reading that said they needed to be in a crate for "so long".  The only time they need to be in the crate is when you aren't supervising them or when you completely leave the house.  The rest of the time, of course they can be out running in the yard or hanging out in the kitchen with you.  Crate training just offers them a safe and secure place to rest and settle down.  Dogs enjoy having a 'den' and that's what a crate is.  Haven't you ever noticed how dogs will curl up behind the couch or under a chair?  That's because its comforting.  A crate can offer that for them.  Just because they are in their crate doesn't mean you have to lock them in there.  They will often sleep in there while the door is open.  Also, its a WONDERFUL tool for house training.  A dog won't relieve themselves inside the crate.  They, by nature, won't soil the area where they sleep.  If you leave them in a small room, there is plenty of room for them to sleep on one side and use the other side as an indoor toilet.  Once they learn that its an acceptable behavior, they'll keep doing it.  I don't want my dogs thinking its okay to use the bathroom floor as their toilet.  As for just leaving them outside, that's not as good as a kennel either.  Too many things to potentially harm them not to mention the lack of supervision.  What's to stop someone from just coming into your yard and taking them or harming them?  I prefer an indoor crate.<br>  <br>  *No, its not acceptable to leave a new puppy in the crate for 8+ hours.  Especially not 8+ hours a day, 5+ days a week.  Not to mention you'd also be crating him at night for another 8 hours.  That's 16+ hours a day in a crate!  Nope, not acceptable.  If you do crate him during the day, then he still needs to be let out and exercised at least once during that 8 hour period.  Otherwise, yes, a pin (or a bathroom/laundry room) would be a better option for you.  Unsupervised for 8 hours every single day though.... are you sure a puppy is what you need right now?  Do you both have the time to devote to properly training and caring for this dog?|`|qwD45UBJaa	What do you mean by "so long?" If you're keeping your 10 week old puppy crated for 8+ hours, it is cruel as they cannot control their bodily functions for that long. Your puppy should be able to hold its potty one hour for each month old it is, plus one. <br>  <br>  While I am at work, I keep my dog in a pen (4 by 4 feet) and have his crate inside with the door off. He prefers to sleep in his crate, but has some room to move around and use his litter box (yes, I said dog and litter box). At night, he sleeps in his crate. Now, at 5 months, he can hold it all night. He LOVES his crate. Being den animals, dogs need that security and protection. It's not cruel, it's comfort.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Dogs and puppies LOVE tight squishy places.  It's in there genes, they feel secure there.  This is why a lot of dogs will ride on the floor of a car, or hide behind the couch ... their instincts tell them it's safe.|`|vJg5k342aa	Crate training is NOT cruel if the puppy is given adequate exercise and opportunities to urinate and defecate.  8 hours is way too long to leave a puppy confined in a crate.  8 hours is the maximum duration that an adult, housebroken, dog with control over his bodily functions can be confined in a crate.  If you leave a puppy in for that long, expect him to be covered in his waste and quite unhappy.<br>  <br>  An 8 week old puppy should be taken outside at least every two hours...more frequently for toy breeds.  Food intake should be limited for an hour before crating for longer periods of time.|`|wfhKy3jpaa	Some people do leave dogs in crates for up to 8 hours and some dogs don't have a problem with it. When we first got our puppy  we tried to put her in a crate because we were told the puppies like dark little places like that. She HATED it and started freaking out to bad to keep her in there. We thought she was going to hurt herself. So we never put her in there again. She does great in the house alone when we go to run errands and stuff and is a very good little dog. I guess it just depends on the dog.|`|AiAHnPyDaa	With positive reinforcements the dog. The dog will then think it is it's home.|`|xQxSQtBmaa	dogs are den animals so it feels like there own special place.|`|aa4H6qZgaa	I only crate my dogs at night.  They didn't like it the first week or two, but now it is their "safe" place, cozy with lots of blankets and no one bothers them in there.  They hop right into their little beds at night without me telling them.  I also make sure never to invade their safe place by sticking my hand in there or anything like that, that part of the house is theirs.<br>  I don't agree with crating your dog during the day, although I understand the reasoning for it.  If it is nice outside and you have a nice grass area in your yard, buy a cage or fencing to put outside so they can have a little place to hang out during the day, but they can't escape your yard, destroy things, or dig under the fence.  Make sure you walk your dog every morning to keep him/her happy.  If you need to keep him in the house, use a baby gate to lock him in the kitchen, leave him a puppy pad to pee and poop on, some food and water, and a bed or blanket to get off the cold floor.  maybe a chew toy if you want, but he will probably sleep the whole time.  Don't be shocked to come home to poop and pee not on the puppy pad, poop stained footprints all over the place from him walking in it, and spilled water and food everywhere.  You can't get mad because they don't know better yet.  This is how I've raised all my dogs and now they are house trained and just hang out in my living room all day sleeping on the couch until i get home.  but it took me about two years of diligence to get there...

XnIdLz9xaa	You'll probably want a couple of neon tetras, they look brilliant and are quite hardy. Maybe some small angelfish as well, although if they get very large they might end up eating the tetras. You'll want maybe some danios or hatchetfish for the top level of your aquarium, and some corys or loaches  for the bottom to balance it all out. Maybe some livebearers, like swordtails or platies, and a betta. I personally love discus fish, they look amazing, but are a bit more difficult to care for. But they are very gentle and make good tankmates for most laidback fish species.|`|iuFDb1FHaa	tetras<br>  live berears<br>  plecos<br>  guramies<br>  barbs<br>  sharks (not agressive)<br>  corys<br>  alge eaters|`|5xHNGGdoaa	sense you have a fairly large tank i would deff put a few schools of brightly covered fish into it. Neon Tetra's although small when in groups of 6-7 can really brighten up any tank. Also a school of Harlequin Rasbora  wil add a nice relaxing red to the tank. Also you could have a decent size school of bottom feeders. Panda Cory Cats are beautiful and fun to watch, as they chase each other around the bottom, playfully. You could then throw in some brightly colored Dwarf Gourami's. These fish can be seen as a center piece and a great addition to any tank. A few shrimp to help keep things clean. Rainbow fish are also very beautiful fish that are bright and colorful. It would be safe to add all of these fish into a 55 gallon. A dense section of plants will make the smaller fish more comfortable. Hope i helped :)
zqVDJxUIaa	An excellent way to get rid of snails:<br>  Cut up some fresh lettuce, and drop it into the tank before you go to bed. The morning after, you will find that it is covered with snails. If you're feeling brave, put your hand in and pluck it out. You can also use tweezers or any other instrument to remove the lettuce, and dispose of it in the trash. Repeat this until your snail population is under control. Use multiple lettuce leaves for huge infestations. I would recommend against using chemicals to treat your tank, because they can kill beneficial bacteria. Also, cut down on feeding, I only feed my fish once per day.<br>  Good Luck!|`|iuFDb1FHaa	MAYBY THEY ARE BREEDING TOO MUCH AND KEEP ON BREEEDING|`|M3pjhIecaa	You don't mention what type of loach's the type needed are Botia's most common of which are clown loachs but these require to be kept in more than 5 and can exceed 10+ fully grown although i've only ever grown one to that size they are still large fish, other members of this family are yoyo or pakistan, blue, tiger, all of which will do the same job, Once snails get in they difficult to control without chemicals or fish of the type i've mentioned, they will increase dramatically if there's excess food so cut down on the food for the time being and check out some of the fish mentioned.|`|SZOMVGBRaa	Here's what you do...<br>  <br>  Yes loachs are very good snail eaters but they will only go so far you know, snail reproduce fast. They most likely came in on live plants, that's very common. <br>  <br>  So they make snail killing products but that's harmful to more than just snails. <br>  <br>  Get a nice piece of lettuce and stick it in the tank as the lights go out, either weight it down or get a veggie clip.  Then check back on it in about 5 hours or the next morning, you will have tons of snails on it assuming your other fish don;t eat it first. Then just simply remove the lettuce leaf and they are gone. Or like I said they make snail killing products like "had-a-snail"  but who knows whats in em, if it can kill snails I bet it harms fish too to some degree.|`|NkawjuoXaa	You are over feeding your fish.<br>  This is giving your snails a heavy food supply, which allows them to reproduce at night.<br>  one probably caught a ride in on your plants, and settled in the rocks.. when the abundant source of food arrived, it multiplied.|`|NUTpNxSWaa	sometimes when you go to the LFS and buy lets say plants, a really tiny mystery snail could be stuck on it. these dont need other genders to make babies. they are both sexes, male and female. so they reproduce by themselves.|`|MKuDawP7aa	There are many different types of aquarium snails many of which can be good to have in your tank. While some people think of snails as pests (and some are), others buy them on purpose to keep in their tanks. Sometimes, when you purchase plants for your aquarium tiny little snails can be hiding in the plants and you may wake up a week or two later and find your tank to be overrun by snails! Usually, however you can buy large snails at your pet store.<br>  <br>  There are several types of snails you might consider. Each one looks different and has a different demeanor in the tank.<br>  <br>  The Ramshorn snail is thusly named as it’s shape looks like a rams horn. They come in black, red and sometimes checked patterns. This snail will dine on your plants and can reproduce quite quickly.<br>  <br>  The Trumpet snail is a live bearing snail that eats that food and other stuff that has fallen into the substrate. They rarely eat plants so this is a good one to have if you have a lot of plants in your aquarium. Usually they hide during daylight and come out at night, but you will probably see them hanging out on the glass of your tank just below the water line when you first get up in the morning. The Trumpet snail can help clean the debris on the bottom of your tank.<br>  <br>  The Pond snail is the one that typically hitches a free ride into your tank on aquarium plants. Shaped like a football, they reproduce quite quickly and have a veracious appetite for your aquarium plants quickly devouring them.<br>  <br>  The Apple snail is a popular aquarium inhabitant and comes in 4 different species. These snails can eat aquarium plants so you will have to be careful. This snail can live quite a while and may grow as large as a tennis ball if given great care!<br>  <br>  Most aquarium snails will do will in a community tank. Some eat algae and some eat the debris on the bottom so these snails can be quite beneficial to the tank. Other species eat aquarium plants, so be sure you know what you are buying if you have plants in the tank.<br>  <br>  Snails get along good with many types of aquarium fish including Neon Tetras, Guppies, White Cloud Minnows and Danios. However, if you find that some uninvited snails have appeared in your tank, you might try introducing a Skink or Clown Loach into the tank as these guys will happily eat all the snails they can find.<br>  <br>  Aquarium snails are a great way to add something a bit different into your tank, but you must be sure you get snails that are compatible with your fish. When in doubt just ask the clerk at your fish store and they will be sure to point you in the right direction.|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	You have a Malaysian Trumpet Snail invasion - this is why the Loaches have failed. The Trumpet Snail's shape is just too much of a challenge to eat - not even Pufferfish attempt them! They are also hermaphrodite livebearing snails, so will keep reproducing!<br>  <br>  It's going to be physical removal that's the best way forward here. Pick them out, continuously, every day. In a month or two you should be rid of them. Stir the gravel well also, they are EXCELLENT burrowers, often used in sand tanks to keep it oxygenated and not compacted. <br>  <br>  Set vege traps, leave in for a few hours with the lights off, pluck out covered in snails and throw away.|`|VjBciucZaa	those are malasyian trumpets (corn shaped shells rite?) i asked yahoo the same question many times i got rid of mine in a week.<br>  <br>  the specie i bought was cald yoyo loach (Pakistani loach) they do a very good job at killing snails and they look nice i bought 3 of them and they happily devour snails. i also got weather/dojo loaches they also do a pretty good job at killing snails, i heard clown loaches and dwarf puffers are verry good at killing snails but those fish arnt recommended for beginners because they need extra care <br>  <br>  i think you are over feeding your fish or you have to much algae in your tank these snails are harmless but multiply very fast

My dog was diagnosed with kidney failure when he was 6.  He was given about 6 weeks to live but he surprised everyone and lived another 6 years!  My mom and I had to give him an IV four times a week, but it was sure worth it!  I would stop by (at this time I was already moved out and he lived with my parents) after work and help her with keeping him relaxed.  The joy that he brought us made it worth all of the hardships and the heartache.  He was a very special dog and will live in my heart forever.  Just remember how much he loves you and how much you love him and know that you will get through it!  My heart goes out to you, I really hope everything goes well!|`|5UpTGrFZaa	My dog has the same  thing! its not easy to deal with when you find out about it. I bought her when she was five months old and she already had it. for a few months the vets were trying to find out what was making her sick, and that was already costing us a fortune, but now that we know what he problem is, she takes 3 pills before every meal and its seems to be a breeze. Just dont let the vets fool you and try to make you get unnecessary tests done, because thats what they did to us and the bills will run you dry.
OyNJTWaiaa	Even though all my cages have grates, I dont use them. I put paper on top. I also worry about birds hurting their legs and feet. The youngsters dont seem to know how to walk well on them without stepping through and the chance of a broken leg is high. <br>  Also good seed falls straight through the grate and seed wastage is high. <br>  I change the paper often.<br>  If it really bothers you and you want a grate, get some spare aviary mesh and cut a piece to fit.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	You don't need a grate at the bottom of the cage.  I've always used newspaper on the cage tray on the bottom of the cage.  I throw out my grates.  I don't like grates because your birds can easily get their feet injured on them.  Even if you have grates, the birds will poop on their perches or food or water bowl and will step in their poop anyway.  My birds are usually on their perches, not the bottom of the cage.  I change their papers often and keep the cages clean.  They've never become ill due to this cage setup.|`|DslcKefhaa	The world wont end if your birdcage doesnt have a grate. As long as you keep the cage clean you should be fine. However, if the floor has a good deal of poo, that will be a problem. So keep it clean. However, I will bet your birds will be down there shredding the newspaper. So cleanliness is a must. <br>  <br>  You might be able to find a replacement grate on Ebay or check at your local pet store, maybe you can get one at a yard sale. <br>  <br>  If you can find one, that would be best. They are nice to have.|`|qlECsz0Iaa	you dont need a grate, its just a nice thing to have.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	The reason all the cages at the store has a grate is so the birds DO NOt step on it's own poop and some bird tend to eat their poop. Since, you said you clean the newspaper 2 times day you do not need  a grate. <br>  <br>  So, do not worry and they sound happy since you have perches on top  and toys too.<br>  <br>  What would be idle and healthy for the birds would be to let them outside in your room for at least couple of hours like birds should be "free". So, they can work out.<br>  <br>  I would say just get a playpen for them.

Completely!  It is a deadly plant and can be devastating and particularly poisonous when it is in the dead stage, after flowering.  A horse does not have to be eating very much of it before damage is done, whether seen immediately or later.  It causes loss of appetite, loss of weight, unsteadiness and other symptoms.  I have just seen a video clip of a horse suffering from this poisoning.  It is quite distressing but I am thinking that all horse owners should see it so that they do not become complacent.<br>  <br>  To identify it look up ragwort on the internet and see what it comes up with.  I have and it is very interesting.<br>  <br>  There were a couple of years ago several campaigns in different uk counties to identify ragwort and eradicate it from the countryside.  Maybe approach your council for more information.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	Common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea) is a perennial, which means that its roots overwinter and the rosette of leaves will appear as soon as the weather is mild enough.|`|PEPWFGNGaa	They don't come up in Winter but they can start really early.

A 10 gallon tank is so small all you need is to have a small light, those plants you listed need about 4 watts of light per gallon, so do the math. A regular 10 gallon florescent light strip that you can buy puts off about 30 -50 watts depending on what kind you buy. They are all generic though, no need for super special expensive stuff.

tk2AOZU5aa	You know what- I have read all of your answers and I cannot believe it. Animals in America are left to die in shelters because no one wants to take care of them, and here are people telling other people that they are cruel because they are removing their cat's claws so they can live comfortably in their house and have a happy life. <br>  <br>  All of my cats I have ever had in my whole life have been declawed. Not one has ever had a problem. I have one cat that just turned 15 years old and has her front declawed. She used to go outside every once in a while and she has been known to catch birds WITHOUT ANY FRONT CLAWS! She has also been known to climb trees as well as furniture in our home without any troubles. Cats learn to adapt! I would rather do this and have a compatable animal than have one that freaks out and scratches everyone and then no one in the house wants to pay attention to it. This happens more than people want to admit. This is why there are so many homeless pets!<br>  <br>  So before you say that I am cruel for declawing my cat- you might want to take a few things in to consideration. My cat has lived 15 years and walks just fine, climbs just fine, and has been known to catch birds. She is happy. She is VERY healthy. In fact, she just had blood work done and she is as healthy as a 1 year old cat, and she has never had to live on the street!<br>  <br>  By the way- for the person that said there could be complications for the pet if you have the claws removed-- There is a potential for complications with any surgical procedure! That is why they have you sign a permit for surgery. Nothing is guaranteed!|`|ypWBjSiIaa	Here's another question<br>  <br>  How could you make that decision having read all the information there is available on this procedure?<br>  <br>  And LiLLygirl, what a shame you couldn't come up with a less lame and flimsy argument. There are always going to be some unscrupulous vets willing to make a quick buck taking in fools who think it's okay to mutilate their pets for the sake of keeping their carpets nice.<br>  <br>  I've edited this because if you've already had it done, there is no point in trying to convince you otherwise, or making you feel bad about the decision. It's too late.<br>  <br>  But I hope that you wouldn't make this decision again. There is more information out there than ever about the psychological and of course the physical damage it does to cats and it constantly amazes me that people really still see it as a viable solution.<br>  <br>  Lecture over. You know the score. Now consider me backed off.|`|wBbvGdkcaa	I have never declawed my cats, but I know alot about it because my friend got hers declawed.<br>  <br>  Her cats aren't in the best of health,<br>  Her cats are in pain sometimes,<br>  She got hers declawed when they were little kittens,<br>  She had them declawed because she didn't want them to ruin the funiture,<br>  She doesn't regret it,<br>  She is happy with the decision.<br>  <br>  Well, she obviously doesn't love her cats. <br>  DECLAWING IS CRUEL.|`|4pZxnpVkaa	Its not my cat, but my sister had her cat declawed and wound up having to get rid of it because it started biting everyone :(  It bit our neice and that was that, she had to get stitches on her hand.  The cat also had problems using the litter box and would pee all over the place, and I have heard that's from the declawing.  I have no idea what happened to the cat, but it was so sweet but it was messing the furniture up and thats why they had its claws taken off.  They said they wont get another cat.  I was really sad :(|`|nkjsyxcsaa	personally,I think its an act of legal cruelty,it would be like you having your fingernails & toenails ripped out...so would you be happy and be free of pain.But thats just my opinion|`|TjXU0VV0aa	I got a cat from a friend of the family who had it done to her Siamese cat. I was so appalled that i did a lot of research on it. She got two kittens and had them declawed so they wouldnt scratch up her furniture.  It WAS a painful recovery for the cats. So anyone who is telling you here that it is not .. is not being honest .. or their cat's behavior was likely misinterpreted. It is a painful procedure. It is described on the pain scales as being "severely painful" as compared with "moderate pain" for having a cat spayed and "mild pain" for neutering.  Medicating your cat for the post procedural pain is difficult as well. Pain meds for cats are pretty much just people pain meds and they come with the same risks as when administered to humans. Under-medicating is also an issue because where humans express their discomfort cats will often fixate on it (licking) or sleep constantly. Many people mistake this sleep for their cat's comfort when in fact it is their way of avoiding pain. <br>  In the end .. having her cats declawed didnt work for the "old lady" because we ended up with one of her cats.  lol   BUT .. she was a couple of years old when she came to live with us and she was always a happy health INDOOR cat.  There are issues with many declawed cats using their litter boxes but our cat did not.  Also .. she was a heck of a mouser!!  We had mice one really cold winter and .. she would catch them (they didnt stay long lol) And she was a happy loving cat throughout her life.   She always longed to go outside though .. and we didnt feel comfortable with that living in such a rural area where other animals may come into contact with her .. we didnt feel she would be able to fully defend herself. <br>  I would implore you .. not to have your cat declawed. Purely for the sake of the pain. NO SURGERY on anyone or anything would be without pain. Its just common sense.  If your cat is digging furniture etc. you can do other things.  There are tips and tricks out there.  Or try to get an older cat .. because often outside of the 3-ish year mark when a cat is not so young they dont tend do do it as much anyway. PLUS .. if you get a cat from cat rescue .. then you can get a cat that has been living with a foster family .. so you can ask and get honest answers about the personality and behavior of the cat you're adopting.  <br>  Hope that helps some!  Good Luck !  :)|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Five Reasons Why Kitties Need Their Claws<br>  <br>  1. For protection. Honestly, we prefer to run away and not fight at all (unless someone is trespassing on our turf). But there are times when we just can't escape. Claws are our first line of defense, if the hissing and fluffed-out tail doesn't scare away our opponent. Plus, if we get outdoors (it can happen even to indoor cats) and we need to get away from a dog or another predator, we need our claws to climb trees skillfully. Clawless kitties have been attacked and killed because they couldn't make it up a tree fast enough.<br>  2. To mark our territory. Personally, I think this visual way of showing off our turf is a much nicer way of designating our territory than spraying. Plus, our paw pads leave a scent undetectable to you humans, but which any cat can recognize. That's why you sometimes see declawed cats "scratching" your furniture — they're still leaving their mark, only not as obviously since it's only scent and not visual. If you don't want us marking your furniture with our claws, you should get us a cat tree, or a scratching post with cat-approved surface. Our turf is important to us!<br>  3. For fitness. I keep on saying it over and over again, but I can't emphasize it enough: our claws are essential for our paw, front leg, shoulder and back health. We need to be able to dig into a surface and grab onto it so we can stretch our front legs and bodies. This helps us keep our long, lean look (I hear you humans do something called Pilates for the same reason). It also keeps us flexible far into old age. We need to stretch our toes too, and for that claws are necessary.<br>  4. To catch prey. You think that just because you feed us every day that we should not feel the need to catch things. That kind of thinking is totally ridiculous, and really very typical of human shortsightedness. For one thing, we cats are far more instinctual than you humans, and we have to be since we lack the highly sophisticated reasoning ability you people are supposed to have (but seem to so rarely utilize). Plus we need to keep in practice — what would happen if, one day, if we got out and couldn't get back home, or you keeled over and died or something and we had to fend for ourselves? A declawed cat can still catch prey, but nowhere near as well as we want to or may need to! Our hunting skills need to stay finely tuned. So even if our prey is only small bugs or just the cheap toy mice you get from the pet store, having our claws will help us keep in practice. And snatching something in midair with the hook of just one claw is so gratifying!<br>  5. So we can express ourselves. Most of the time you can tell what we're thinking by looking at how we've positioned our ears, and how we are moving our tails. But sometimes we really need to hammer a point home — say, with an unruly new kitten or an overly-friendly dog. Most of the time a good slap, with our claws in, will do the trick, but occasionally we need to flash just a touch of claw. Not enough to do any damage, mind you, but as a warning that there are lines that must not be crossed with us. We can handle our claws with the skill of an expert swordsman. Think Zorro with whiskers and pointy ears. If we knew the alphabet, I bet that most of us kitties could carve the most delicate, nearly invisible "C" on the back of your couch. Unless we are very frightened, cats know exactly how much claw to reveal. Declawed cats must resort to biting when they feel threatened, which is no fun for anyone<br>  <br>  <br>  Five Bad Things That Can Happen When a Cat Is Declawed<br>  <br>  1. We could have surgical or post-surgical complications. Since it is actually amputation, declawing is major surgery for a cat and there is a whole list of things that could possibly go wrong. Being under general anesthesia (the only way a cat is able to go through a declaw) always carries a risk of death. There is also the possibility of hemmorage. After surgery, our paws are wrapped in bandages, and it's not uncommon for us to rip them off, which hampers healing and could invite infection. Sometimes part of a claw grows back, and the cat has to have a second operation. Sometimes the surgery goes wrong and more of the paw has to be amputated. Don't think this is all that rare, or that it only happens at bad veterinary clinics. My human knows someone who works at a very high-end clinic that caters to movie stars' pets. The declawing of one Maine **** went wrong, gangrene set in, and nearly half its foot had to be cut off. This cat is crippled and deformed for life.<br>  2. Your cat may stop using his litterbox. It's impossible to predict how painful a cat's paws are going to be after declawing. Of course, they will extremely painful while he is healing, and very, very sensitive to the sharp points of clay litter. That's why a veteranarian who declaws will tell the cat's human to use a paper-based litter such as Yesterday's News during the healing process. But sometimes a cat's paws are tender even after they heal, and he may never use the litterbox again. Humans who were upset that their cat was scratching their belongings will be even less thrilled when he begins peeing on them.<br>  3. A cat may undergo unpleasant personality changes. How would you feel if some big creatures knocked you out and when you woke up, you were in great pain and parts of your fingers were gone? So if you declaw your cat and afterwards she isn't the same cuddly creature she was before the operation, can you blame her? Sure some cats recover from the surgery and they act as if nothing (or almost nothing) happened. But there's no guarantee. A cat could also become fearful, defensive, unfriendly or angry. Maybe she'll become withdrawn and spend most of her time hiding. Your cat may never trust you again.<br>  4. Declawing causes longterm physical complications. The same way you need all your toes for walking, cats need those clawed joints to move naturally. In fact, cats need that part of their feet even more because they are far more physical creatures than humans are. Cats don't sit at a desk all day and just climb a few stairs now and again. They get around by leaping, jumping and reaching for whatever flat surface that they want to lie on. Declawing hampers a cat's ability to move in ways that aren't immediately obvious to human eyes, but over months and years it can cause them to develop arthritis and crippling structural changes. In addition, the joints of the declawed paws may become painfully contracted — permanently. A cat's inability to stretch properly will cause stiffness over the years, causing him to age prematurely. Declawing is very bad for a cat's longterm health.<br>  5. Declawed cats must never be allowed out of doors, and are in great danger if they do get out. A cat without claws cannot defend itself against predators such as dogs and coyotes, and has trouble climbing trees to escape them. And there are not just animal predators around, either. Members of dog fighting rings love to find declawed cats to use as bait — they're far less messy to capture and use than clawed cats. Bunchers (evil humans who acquire animals for labs) also love them since they're easier to handle than clawed cats. A lot of humans say they have no intention of letting their cats get outside, but accidents and disasters happen and you never know when you'll find an open door or hole in a window screen and your cat missing. A cat should have all she needs to defend herself — or escape — in case of such an emergency.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	probably as happy as a human would be if all its finger tips were chopped off.  You'd keep going but you would miss them.|`|LURQBU86aa	I personally haven't had any of my cats declawed, but my family has always had their cats declawed and none of them have ever had any problems since. I think that if my family would have worked with the cats and trained them to use a scratching post then the surgery would have been unecessary, but they're all fine with the decisions they've made. I wouldn't have any of my cats declawed unless there were no other options, and luckily there haven't been any problems with them scratching things. Most cats recover fairly quickly from the surgery. The recovery is easier on younger cats than older cats because they weigh less and therefore have less stress on their paws. There are alot of websites that show the horrors of declawing cats, but more than likely if you go to a good reputable vet that knows what they're doing there shouldn't be any problems.|`|WqVawp0Kaa	I rescued a cat that was already declawed. I personally wouldn't choose to declaw my cat. I'de throw out the leather couches before I declawed my cat. But my cat is perfectly fine. Make sure your cat remains an inside cat and never abandon it because it will have a hard time defending itself in the case of a cat fight. Don't let the Vet declaw your cat by way of pulling the claws out. They have a new way of laser removing the claws now, it's a little more expensive but if you truly are an animal lover you'll at least make this sacrifice.|`|S6ie5HwBaa	Cats need there claws, for balance, defence, stress relief and there health, they actual walk on their whole paw include these toes! Having no toes, often result in muscle problems becauase they cannot stretch properly or scratch properly, as well as behavioural problems such as Biting & Spraying urine, Declawing for cats is PERMANENT PAIN! <br>  <br>  If you are considering declawing your cat, please read this. It will only take a moment, and it will give you valuable information to help you in your decision.<br>  <br>  First, you should know that declawing is pretty much an American thing, it's something people do for their own convenience without realizing what actually happens to their beloved cat. In England declawing is termed "inhumane" and "unnecessary mutilation." I agree. In many European countries it is illegal. I applaud their attitude.<br>  <br>  Before you make the decision to declaw your cat, there are some important facts you should know. Declawing is not like a manicure. It is serious surgery. Your cat's claw is not a toenail. It is actually closely adhered to the bone. So closely adhered that to remove the claw, the last bone of your the cat's claw has to be removed. Declawing is actually an amputation of the last joint of your cat's "toes". When you envision that, it becomes clear why declawing is not a humane act. It is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery period. And remember that during the time of recuperation from the surgery your cat would still have to use its feet to walk, jump, and scratch in its litter box regardless of the pain it is experiencing. Wheelchairs and bedpans are not an option for a cat.<br>  <br>  No cat lover would doubt that cats--whose senses are much keener than ours--suffer pain. They may, however, hide it better. Not only are they proud, they instinctively know that they are at risk when in a weakened position, and by nature will attempt to hide it. But make no mistake. This is not a surgery to be taken lightly.<br>  <br>  Your cat's body is perfectly designed to give it the grace, agility and beauty that is unique to felines. Its claws are an important part of this design. Amputating the important part of their anatomy that contains the claws drastically alters the conformation of their feet. The cat is also deprived of its primary means of defense, leaving it prey to predators if it ever escapes to the outdoors.<br>  <br>  I have also had people tell me that their cat's personality changed after being declawed. Although, the medical community does not recognize this as potential side effect.<br>  <br>  Okay, so now you realize that declawing is too drastic a solution, but you're still concerned about keeping your household furnishings intact. Is there an acceptable solution? Happily, the answer is yes. A big, joyful, humane YES! Actually there are several. The following website "Cat Scratching Solutions" provides many solutions as well as and insight into the psychology of why cats scratch. You can teach your cat to use a scratching post (sisal posts are by far the best). You can trim the front claws. You can also employ aversion methods. One of the best solutions I've found is Soft Paws?.<br>  <br>  Soft Paws are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws. They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post. Soft Paws? are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks. They come in clear or colors--which are really fun. Now that's a kitty manicure! The colored caps look spiffy on Tabby or Tom and have the added advantage of being more visible when one finally comes off. Then you simply replace it. You can find Soft Paws? on the web by clicking here or call 1-800-989-2542.<br>  <br>  You need to remember, though, that the caps and nail trimming should only be used on indoor cats who will not be vunerable to the dangers of the outdoors.<br>  <br>  For a list of countries in which declawing is illegal<br>  England<br>  Scotland<br>  Wales<br>  Italy<br>  France<br>  Germany <br>  Austria<br>  Switzerland<br>  Norway<br>  Sweden<br>  Netherlands<br>  Northern Ireland <br>  Ireland<br>  Denmark<br>  Finland<br>  Slovenia<br>  Portugal<br>  Belgium <br>  Brazil<br>  Australia<br>  New Zealand<br>  Yugoslavia<br>  Japan<br>  <br>  Yes, it is. To remove a cat's claws is far worse than to deprive cat owners of their fingernails. This is because the claws have so many important functions in the life of a cat. A declawed cat is a maimed cat, and anyone considering having the operation done to his pet should think again. People hastily declaw cats hoping to protect their furniture as well as themselves from potential scratches. It's natural for a cat to scratch, but with a little human effort, you can direct that energy so that you, your cat, and your furniture can comfortably live together.<br>  <br>  Consider the facts. To begin with, it is important that every cat should keep itself well groomed. A smooth, clean coat of fur is essential for a cat's well-being. It is vital for temperature control, for cleanliness, for waterproofing, and for controlling the scent signaling the feline body. As a result, cats spend a great deal of time every day dealing with their toilet. In addition to the typical licking movements, they perform repeated scratchings. These scratching actions are a crucial part of the cleaning routine, getting rid of skin irritations, dislodging dead hairs, and combing out tangles in the fur. Without claws, it is impossible for any cat to scratch itself efficiently, and the whole grooming pattern suffers as a result. Even if the human owners help out with brush and comb, there is no way they can replace the sensitivity of the natural scratching response of their pet. Anyone who has ever suffered an itch that can't be scratched will sympathize with the dilemma of the declawed cat.<br>  <br>  It has been argued that a declawed cat can learn to use its teeth more when grooming. It is true that cats often nibble an irritation rather than scratch it, but unfortunately, some of the most urgent scratching requirements are in the region of the head, mouth, neck, and especially, the ears. Teeth are useless here, and these important parts of the body cannot be kept in perfect condition with only clawless feet to groom them.<br>  <br>  A second problem faces the declawed cat when it tries to climb. Climbing is second nature to all small felines, and it is virtually impossible for a cat to switch off its urge to climb, even if it is punished for doing so. And punished it certainly will be if it attempts to climb after having its claws removed, for it will no longer have any grip in its feet. Even the simple act of climbing up onto a chair or a window ledge may prove hazardous. Without the pinpoint contact of the tips of the claws, the animals may find themselves slipping and crashing to the ground. The expression of disbelief and confusion that is observed on the faces of such cats as they pick themselves up is in itself sufficient to turn any cat lover against the idea of claw removal. If the cat accidentally gets out of doors, it is defenseless against enemies (other cats in a cat fight, dogs, mean humans, etc.). In addition, scratching offers psychological comfort through its rhythmic action, and reassurance of self-defense by the contraction of the claws.<br>  <br>  In addition to destroying the animal's ability to groom, climb, defend itself against rivals, and protect itself from enemies, the operation of declawing also eliminates the cat's ability to hunt. This may not be important for a well-fed family pet, but if ever such a cat were to find itself lost or homeless, it would rapidly die of starvation. The vital grab at a mouse with sharp claws extended would become a useless gesture.<br>  <br>  In short, a declawed cat is a crippled, mutilated cat, and no excuse can justify the operation. Despite this, many pet cats are carried off to the vet by exasperated owners for this type of convenience surgery. The operation, although nearly always refused by vets in Britain, has become so common in certain countries that it even has an official name. It is called onyxectomy. Using an old Greek name for it somehow makes it seem more respectable. The literal translation of onyxectomy, however, is simply "nail-cutting out" and that is what vets are doing, even though they may not like to be reminded of the fact when they record their day's work.<br>  <br>  The consequences of declawing are often pathetic. Changes in behavior can occur. A declawed cat frequently resorts to biting when confronted with even minor threats. Biting becomes an overcompensation for the insecurity of having no claws. Bungled surgery can result in the regrowth of deformed claws or in an infection leading to gangrene. Balance is affected by the inability to grasp with their claws. Chronic physical ailments such as cystitis or skin disorders can be manifestations of a declawed cat's frustration and stress.<br>  <br>  The reason for the popularity of the declawing operation in recent years has been the concern of owners for their furnishings. Valuable chair fabrics, curtains, cushions, and other materials are often found scratched, torn, and tattered as a result of the family cat's claw sharpening activities around the house, and the addition of commercially manufactured scratching posts to the indoor furniture rarely seems to solve the problem by itself. It takes other measures by the pet owner in combination with an alternative scratching area. Home furnishings are expensive, but a cat's well-being is priceless.<br>  <br>  5 reason cat need their claws<br>  5 reason why cats need there claws<br>  For protection. Honestly, we prefer to run away and not fight at all (unless someone is trespassing on our turf). But there are times when we just can't escape. Claws are our first line of defense, if the hissing and fluffed-out ta|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I have known several cats that have been declawed. Many of those cats will bite without hesitation. Many people claim that their cat is "fine" afterwards, but they also don't realize that later inappropriot elimination or agressiveness/biting is because the cat was declawed and only has its teeth left to defend itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Before you decide to have another cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats that have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat that has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs its claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it.

Also, they need to get used to the temperature, and humidity, or the layout, and the new sounds, everything really.

She'll eventually become used to you, and then you can see if she is pregnant, but don't try to hold them for too long, to soon, wait until they are more confident around you.

Its kind of common I guess but before I adopted her I name was Mimi. I also like the name Clover, except that sounds more of a male dogs name. <br>  <br>  Well whatever you choose to name your dog, have fun with her. I know that this is a male dogs name but my Mom's friend just got a new dog in summer and named him Ramsey. The point to saying that was that unique names can be really random. Also try to think of a name that fits her personality. <br>  I kind of chose a theme to go with my dog. Like we bought her a hot pink leash, a hot pink collar, a hot pink bowel.

34uWa9kHaa	You need to find a behavorist not just a trainer.   Most "trainer's" can not help with behavioral issues.   Behavorist's  can work with the problem & can teach you how to MANAGE the dog aggression.   You can NOT train dog aggression out of the dog.   It's genetics. <br>  <br>  How old is your dog?   If she is maturing this is the time dog aggression shows.   <br>  Typically between 2-3 yrs of age sometimes younger 1.5 yrs of  age.<br>  <br>   Dogs regardless of breed or mix can become dog aggressive.   Your dog is mixed with Pit Bull so you can not deny that part of it's genetics.  <br>  Some Pit Bulls never become dog aggressive some do. Dog aggression has nothing to do people.   Just dogs.   Pit Bulls were bred to love people not be human aggressive. <br>  Some think dog aggression leads to human aggression that is incorrect. <br>  <br>  Stop taking your dog to the park to meet other dogs one day you are not gonna be able to seperate them when a fight starts.  An owner is not gonna be understanding.   <br>  Right now you are setting your dog up to fail and putting it's life at risk for if she seriously got a hold of another dog.   She could be declaired dangerous.      <br>  <br>  I have a male here that does not like other dogs coming up into his face.  But with proper intros he will play with them.    I do not take my dogs too dog parks however.  I do not trust the other owners and it's a breeding ground for disease. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just becareful what you do with her for now.   Find a behavorist in your area.   You need to learn how to distract her and focus on you not the other dogs etc.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	unfortunately as the proud owner of a pit bull, you need to understand dog aggression is a genetic trait and will never be "trained" out of it. You need to just accept that your dog should not be meeting other dogs unless she can do it with out fighting.  My put loves some dogs and others it can't stand but I NEVER take the chance. HE has a few doggy friends and a sister that is all he needs. It is not a unmanageable thing that your dog has dog aggression. Your dog can still live a happy life with out meeting new dogs all the time.

jOdzofOAaa	They could have been infertile. The hen's probably discarding them because she knows they're duds. In the wild, such an egg would be an attraction to a predator so she has to get rid of it. The other reason she's actually eating the egg might be because she needs the nutrition, laying will use up alot of her reserves. I have finches, we offer them eggfood(you could also give live small mealworms) for protein and cuttlebone-this will be sold at any petshop, egg shells-purchased commercially or home made using hard-boiled eggs for a good source of calcium-which may be why she is eating the eggs. (And we spoil ours with the odd bit of fruit, milletspray and veg, but only a bit! :)  ) <br>  <br>  I'd try and rule out the nutrition first and see if that makes any difference, if she's still doing it then ask again :) hope this helps :) <br>  <br>  ...you can also try removing the nest during this process as unfortunately once finches get into this bad habit of eating their eggs it is hard to change, by starting fresh it may hopefully get them out of the routine, replacing the nest once they are replenished with calcium and protein :)|`|5efcbc663b7fc36633fcb20f8ab06f77aa	does she have a nesting box?<br>  if not she needs one.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	i'm guessing she has a calcium deficiency.  creating eggs depletes the calcium in a bird's body, and one way to restore it is by eating eggshells.  if you don't want her to do it, try grinding up chicken eggshells and see if she'll eat that instead.|`|pYF9KnNeaa	Laying puts a huge strain on their health and especially on their calcium reserves.  Get her a cuttle bone and make sure she never runs out of it.  As mentioned, you can also grind up egg shells and sprinkle on her wet foods.  But, the shells must be boiled first to kill bacteria and they must be ground up very fine.  You can also shave a little off the cuttle bone for her wet foods.  If she runs short of calcium, her eggs will be too soft for her to pass and she will be egg bound.  That is life threatening if not recognized immediately and dealt with properly.  She could die very quickly if egg bound.  I hope this helps.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	My brother had finches and they laid like 3 eggs a day and ate all of them! <br>  I guess thats theyre way of abortion<br>  You may have to take the egg out and take care of it.

Their popularity stems from their personality, which has been compared to that of a puppy. Many keepers experience begging around meal times or the seemingly playful greetings they receive from their fish when they get home. <br>  <br>  There are a few color varieties including albino, olive-green, brown and dark gray. They can get quite large, usually 12-14 inches and should be kept in a 55 gallon or larger aquarium. The Oscar is also known for being one of the more messy tropical fish to keep. Try to get the best filtration system possible for them and be prepared to perform frequent water changes. They are known to rearrange their environment from time to time and to bash in to filter uptake tubes and heaters. If you are wanting to keep live plants in an aquarium you may not want to get an Oscar because they love to dig up plants. They are also very good jumpers, so a heavy hood is a necessity. <br>  <br>  They will eat most flakes, pellets, frozen, freeze dried and live foods including any other fish they share a tank with that are small enough to fit in their mouths. <br>  <br>  Picture<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Freshwater Fish Species Profile and Care Information <br>  Scientific Name : Astronotus ocellatus<br>  Common Names : Albino Oscar, Tiger and Red Oscar, Marbled Cichlid<br>  <br>  Care Level : Easy, good for freshwater beginners with a large enough tank and those with an adequate aquarium filter and those willing to perform frequent partial water changes.<br>  <br>  Size : 13 inches (33 cm)<br>  <br>  pH : 6 - 8<br>  <br>  Temperature : 72°F - 80°F (22°C - 27°C)<br>  <br>  Water Hardness : 5° to 20° dH<br>  <br>  Origin / Habitat : Amazon<br>  <br>  Lifespan : 10 - 13 years<br>  <br>  Temperament / Behavior : They can be aggressive if not given a large enough aquarium.<br>  <br>  Breeding Oscar Fish / Mating / Reproduction : They reach sexual maturity at 4 inches and will form life long pairs.

My husband has never been fond of fish but he fell madly in love with the oscar who he named Claude. It's the best investment I feel I've ever made. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: Darrel<br>  These fish are seriously aggressive! I have had many over the years and all have been fighters. If the fish are small enough they will be eaten, only compatible sized fish should be kept in the same tank. I had a 7 inch oscar eat a 5 inch pictus cat head first, with all 3 spines stuck through the head of the oscar. The pictus died but the oscar survived with a little torque jaw after snipping the pictus spines off with diagonal cutters and pulling the fish out. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: Larry<br>  The agressiveness of these fish will vary on a fish to fish basis. I have owned many throughout the years and have had some that eat anything that moves, but the one I have right now is about twelve inches long and won't eat anything over one inch long. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: Mellonie<br>  I have my second set of oscars now, and they are a joy when it comes time for feeding. Be sure to feed them a variety of protein rich food with "live" food for snacks. If you aren't careful of selecting healthy "feeder fish" your Oscar will get sick. Be sure to watch closely, because the "live" fish usually don't last long. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: Dennis<br>  I alternate between hikari chiclid staple, frozen blood worms (thawed) and feeders. Make sure the feeders are small enough to be eaten in one shot as they make a horrible mess other wise. With this routine you should see about an inch a month growth. Oscars are usaully super aggressive, easy to take care of, and are one of the faster growing fish available, making them the most popular and funnest tropical fish you can buy. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: DeeDee<br>  Oscars are very spoiled and they eat other fish because they are very territorial. Buy one and enjoy the fascination that we encounter from investing in an oscar. <br>  <br>  <br>  From: Andrea<br>  We just got our little guy 'A.J.' and he is fun to watch. He greets me whenever I come close to the tank. It's neat to know a fish can have a personality. He is part of the family now! <br>  <br>  <br>  From: New Owner<br>  I recently decided to tr

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Black ones are just a little tricky since you can't see any gravid spot, but if they are pregnant they seem to become very rounded stomach, which will look like it's about to drop or explode. Please note that all molly pregnancy is different, some get extreme huge stomach while other just get a rounded stomach but doesn't always look like it's going to explode. I have noticed that while my mollies are pregnant they have different personality depending on the fish, some increased their eating habits while others decrease their eating habits and spend time by them self in a corner or near filter but make sure it's not gasping for air(fish gasp for air when they don't get enough oxygen in the water). Always examine the fish you think is pregnant because it could be an internal bacteria infection know as dropsy: <a href="http://www.fishdeals.com/fish_diseases/dropsy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishdeals.com/fish_diseases/d...</a> that has been often mistaken as pregnancy. Most of my pregnant mollies has given birth 4 weeks after they mated and some took as long as 2 months; it all depends on the fish. Mollies can also eat there young so make sure you have a place to keep these young. A breeding box is fine for a while: <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-Multi-Purpose-3-Way-Breeders.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/7449/Lee-s-...</a> but the youngs needs to move to another tank so they can grow till they get big enough to not fit in any of your fish's mouth. I fed babies a food called "First bite" <a href="http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikari-First-Bites.aspx?CoreCat=OnSiteSearch" rel="nofollow">http://www.petco.com/product/10906/Hikar...</a> two to three times daily for two months and i switch to regular flakes which i placed into a zip lock bag and crushed it into fined powder and they loved it. After they are big enough not to be eaten by any of the fish in your tank, you can place them in there and they will have to adapt to the way the adults eat, they will be bullied for a while but they will make it, it's the cycle of life.

97cea69af418b36fa64d887915f51776aa	Hey, i know exactly how you feel, i started raising fish when i was only ten, started with a one gallon a got as one of my Christmas gift and then parents got me a two 10 gallon when i was 16 or 17. They wouldn't buy a bigger tank for me bigger tank since i was always asking for more tank, so i started saving money i got from allowance, holidays, and such and i have managed to buy me a 30 gallon tank. I had the same type of fish you have except the betta (didn't like the way they were houses in the store) I started with 2 or 3 males platies and some guppies and dwarf gourami, and black widow tetra. I noticed that the male platies always nipped at each other including the gourami which eventually had enough and killed one of the platies. I tried doing research but never came to the exact resource so i went out and went to buy a female platies 2-3, and i added them to my tank, and i noticed that each male paired off with a female and the nipping gradually came to a stop. Like they say a solution seems to cause something else to worry about, few weeks later all the females got really big, meaning pregnant. About a month later one afternoon after coming home from school i saw a tank full of platy fry (baby), some where getting eaten, so i quickly removed as much as i could and placed them into the 10 gallon, way too much to count. Let me tell you that they kept having tons of babies every month, and it was getting too much that i had to donate alot to the petstore. It got to the point that both my 10 got over populated that i had to give the males away and kept my females, which never nipped or attack each other or another fish. With more research i have learned that fish will nip at each other if the tank is crowed so that they can eventually kill other fish and reduce the population and now i became so good with fish that now i breed and sell them to my local fish store and now i keep fish such as Oscars, and Jack Dempsey (aggressive fish)<br>  <br>  Redness may be some sort of parasite if it looks like a red pimple, but if not than it might be that the beta was bleeding, eitherways take the betta out because long finned fish always happens to be victims to fin nips to many fish because it looks so pleasant and appealing, yes it can live without a filter but it means that you have to keep it's water clean, i would recommend you to get a filter and a heater for it otherwise it will be vulnerable to diseases such as ich and as well as other deadly disease. You can also donate the males and get the females or get females with the males you have to note that each month you will get at least 20 babies from each female you have, so its up to you, it sound like you are close to over populated,so it will be great if you can get the 20 gallon, but i wouldn't put it on a tv cart unless it's one of the solids types with no wheels(strong wooden) because they tank can be quiet heavy and it might just fall and scatter everywhere if it's not place on a solid stable surface. Take care and please don't let anything discourage you from keeping fish because it will be very useful latger, beleive me on that, i have people drooling at my fish and aquarium everytime i get a visit, i didn't give up no matter what i have been told and i highly encourage you not to give up either. Take care and if you need more help just click on my image and send me an e-mail, good luck wish you the best.|`|tShDXmgbaa	More than likely the platy is nipping the bettas fins which is why bettas do not belong in community tanks even though some people have managed to make it work.  The best thing to do is move the betta to its own tank.  If its fins are torn badly and the betta is stressed this could led to fin rot if you dont treat him with something to help his fins heal.  Streaks of red in his fins could also indicate amonia burns.|`|jnzSz3tRaa	put the platies in a different tank.  you should never get nippy fish with a beta because they will nip at its tail and fins, which is the reason for the redness and holes.<br>  <br>  a tank weighs about the gallons with another 0 at the end. (20 gallon weighs about 200lb)|`|mnaNKujPaa	Get rid of the platties and treat the tank to prevent fin rot in the bettas torn fins. When you have had a fish a while it is easy to get attached so you have to look after that one. Ask about maybe the store will help you re home the platties and advise you on something more suitable for your tank at a later date when you are ready. Just try to go for quality and compatibility with your fish rather than quantity You are only young and have plenty of time to have better tanks later - when you have got the hang of the (sometimes complicated) basics. Good Luck and I hope your fish recovers.

y31mee4Faa	Maile, everything you read on the internet is not always true.  The information posted on many websites came from somewhere else and a lot of times it is edited to suit the message(s) offered on the new website.<br>  <br>  Don't ever just accept what you read on one site as being the only right answer, especially when you're looking for information for or about companion birds.<br>  <br>  Many of the lists of toxic foods & other things have been copied from site to site to site, but the truth is that very little of the toxic information pertains to our feathered friends, simply because there has not been any in depth studies done on exactly what is and what is not toxic to companion parrots.  Then there is the fact that something might be toxic to your 'tiel, but not toxic to my conure.<br>  <br>  Species from different continents have immunities to different things.  Most of the information on toxic lists has been compiled from things known to be toxic to animals and/or pets in general, which is OK.<br>  <br>  The toxicity problem with beans is usually in their dried state because of the hemaglutin in them, however, they're OK after being cooked.<br>  <br>  For the tomatoes, the fruit is OK, but the plant, stems & leaves are toxic.  Tomato plants are a member of the nightshade family, a family of plants that is generally toxic to all animals, including humans.<br>  <br>  You might want to join one of the cockatiel or other online bird groups.<br>  <br>  Here's several you might want to check out:<br>  <br>  FeedingFeathers-subscribe @ yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  parrot_adventures-subscribe @ yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  Strictly-Cockatiels-subscribe @ yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  thecockatielperch-subscribe @ yahoogroups.com<br>  <br>  (the links would not list right, so cut & paste them, but take the spaces out of the middle)<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|pYF9KnNeaa	The great thing about our pet birds is they can eat ALMOST anything we eat.  Of course there are some toxic exceptions so it's great that you are learning.  The first rule, is never give your bird anything until you have verified it's safety.  As for beans, they are no danger so long as they are thoroughly cooked.  Since the list of safe food items is so much longer than the list of toxic items, it's easier to study the "bad" list.  I'm going to give you some links that will help you do that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avianweb.com/toxicfoods.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://birds.about.com/od/feeding/tp/poisonousfoods.htm" rel="nofollow">http://birds.about.com/od/feeding/tp/poi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.itsagreysworld.com/diet/food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.itsagreysworld.com/diet/food....</a><br>  <br>  Pay close attention to this last one.  It not only covers foods but all of the other toxic products you likely have in your home that  can kill your birds.  We all have lots of them so check the lists right away and stop using anything that you see listed.  Some of these items do damage over the long term but some of them will literally drop your bird dead in it's tracks.

juk0m4osaa	before you buy a dog with your friend, make sure you check with them first.  dogs as gifts are never a good idea unless the person you're giving it to knows about it beforehand, otherwise they may not be ready to take on the responsibility and have to find the dog another home or take him to a shelter (which can be stressful for the dog [and the person] and can be a long and hard process OR if it ends up in a shelter it runs the risk of being euthanized if a home can't be found)<br>  <br>  try this quiz on animal planet:  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselector.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a><br>  you can answer questions about preferences and it will help you select the proper breed for the family<br>  my recommendation would be some type of spaniel.  they get to be 30-50 pounds and they're great family dogs.  they're usually quite gentle and lovable. <br>  i wouldn't worry too much about the fear of bigger dogs, if you get the dog as a puppy it'll (obviously) be a lot smaller and won't be full sized until about a year old, so the fear should subside by then (it's hard to be afraid of a dog you start to love when it's little, you'll still love it when it's big)<br>  good luck!|`|F27az9NEaa	I doubt you've studied lots about dogs in the past..hour or so.<br>  You just asked a question about which small dog breed would be best for your friend with the four year old.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Small children play too rough with little dogs.

Look at the link that Pateint Paws posted. 7 dogs, and all "Teacups" for that matter. She pays ridiculous amounts of money for poorly bred dogs, and since she is famous the dogs get a lot of publicity.. therefor encouraging uniformed citizens tyring to be like a celebrity, to buy one of these puppy mill productions. <br>  <br>  Why does anyone want to be like Paris Hilton anyways?

If you put them in a vivaquarium setup, they will drown themselves, and you will be out $50 per frog.<br>  <br>  Edit: How about African Dwarf Frogs.

I suggest that person should do some research like I did before I actually went out and bought dart frogs.<br>  <br>  Edit: He said "vivaquarium."

The sooner this is accomplished the sooner your pet can be healthy and happy and enjoy its life. <br>  Puppies with worms are sick puppies and this needs to be remedied as soon as possible. <br>  Step2<br>  Keep fleas away from your puppy as much as possible. Fleas are a major cause of tapeworm problems in pets, so it is wise to purchase whatever the veterinarian recommends for your puppy in order to get rid of fleas. Do not use the same product on a cat unless your veterinarian tells you it's all right, as some products are designed solely for dogs and can be harmful to cats. <br>  Step3<br>  Give your puppy a dose of Kaopectate to help rid them of the physical problems that worms can cause, such as diarrhea and vomiting. Your veterinarian can tell you how much to give your puppy. If necessary, use a syringe to push the medicine into the puppy's mouth. He probably won't like the taste of it but it is likely to help if you can get it down him. This will soothe the symptoms until you can completely get rid of the worms. <br>  Step4<br>  Keep your puppy from roaming too far away because this could cause your puppy to wander into something that may cause it to develop worms. Eating rodents and wild rabbits, for example, is a very good way to get an infestation going. Keep your yard clean of debris and animal waste, including the puppy's waste, as this prevents the worms from breeding in your yard and making the problem worse. <br>  Step5<br>  Check your puppy's stool frequently for little white worms about the size and shape of rice. Also you may find worms still attached to the puppy's hind quarters. If the stool looks like diarrhea, has fresh blood in it that appears bright red or even dried blood, making it look dark and thicker than usual, you need to take your puppy to the veterinarian. You must act quickly to get rid of the worms because one thing can lead to another and make the infestation much worse, even potentially leading to heart worms.

You may need to have the medications changed, or something.  You could wind up with a dog with rear limb paralysis.  <br>  You need to check on what that might mean.

5PWzxw4Xaa	dog trainer 30 plus years -<br>  Hey Suzi...your question is an excellent one.  I will tell you what works for me and you can give it a try.<br>  I usually do not leave a tv or radio on due to "strangers voices" but I do leave "easy listening" music on when I am gone...or when a dog I am training is not allowed in a room with the family I keep the rules the same at my house so they get used to it.  I leave a dim light on so lights from outside when a car goes by do not show shadow lights which can cause anxiety in a pup.  I begin a bed time ritual which I believe is crucial for them to have to get to the stage of "feeling comfortable" about bed time.  I start off with a feeding time.  If they are not used to eating at this time I just put some in my hand and let them nibble a bit & have a drink.  Then I snuggle for about 10 min. Next it's a hard and wild play time.  I toss toy after toy to have "run/fun" time until your pup shows she's getting tired.  This can be seen by the more frequent "not bringing the toy back/laying and chewing it" times.  Next I take the pup outside for potty time.  Then we go to their area of sleep.  I chit-chat quietly while I put on the music and prepare their bed.  I lay them down after I dim the lights and make sure the music is loud enough to drown out any outside noises but not so loud it's disruptive.  After they are laying down I sit beside them and coo, as well as give belly rubs, paw pad rubs, head/neck and chin rubs, massage the legs and gently talk or sing softly.  "shhhhh" is often spoken.  "Night time" is often said as words of consistence so they will soon learn when those words are spoken "it's time" will soon register.  Now grant you the first few times you do this it's not going to work like magic...so just realize that and do it anyway.  After about 4 nights your little one should be getting used to it.  Now if the kitchen is a traffic area at night (any family member that may come in late from work etc...) you may need to rethink bedtime area.  Some people use the laundry room because the door can be shut and life can go on outside the room.  Is all I tell you is try it and do what works best for you and your pup.  I hope this helps love.|`|4H4dUBkGaa	Take her running like crazy. It's unlikely that she's that anxious just out of loneliness, and you really want to avoid forming this habit.

Receiving attention all day and being left alone at night is a drastic change for the dog. Possibly try wasting every last bit of energy the dog has, almost forcing him to sleep. Being that tired, he will not even notice. Another option, more of an extreme, is to sleep with him in the kitchen. Wait until the dog falls asleep and then you can leave. Although you are in the same room, it is best to ignore the dog. Your presence allows him to get to sleep with sense of security. After a few nights, it will become more natural for the dog to sleep in the kitchen. Lastly, ask the previous owner what the sleep conditions the dog first experienced were. It may not be upset from the deprivation of yourself rather than missing it's first sleeping environment. Hope this helps!|`|dOb3OMWTaa	my puppy used to do that to she was terrible. this is how i st oped her from barking. she was just lonely so i gave her a big teddy to cuddle into when she is lonely and your puppy could be still hungry and you should leave some food down for her that is what i did and she sleeps all night. And another thing is if she starts to cry during the night never go down to her no matter what because if you do she thinks every time she cries you come don't give in hoped i helped|`|nZg00MQOaa	Most often, barking results from boredom, fear, or frustration.<br>  If you don't hear him do it, but you hear about it from neighbors, it's likely your dog barks out of boredom when you're not around. In short, he enjoys barking--it's a way to occupy himself when he's left alone.<br>  Fear barking, on the other hand, is a stress response. It's caused by something unknown to the dog, such as a sudden noise or another dog's bark. Fear barking can also result from sights and sounds a dog finds disconcerting, like skateboards or sirens. In these cases, dogs bark to send a clear message to whatever's scaring them: Stay away!<br>  A third type is frustration barking. This occurs when the dog is denied access to something he desperately wants, such as a favorite toy, a piece of steak, or the terrier on the other side of the fence.<br>  <br>  Here's how to treat this problem <a href="http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=957739316985221266621208059686" rel="nofollow">http://www.mediumurl.com/?r=957739316985...</a>|`|f8bazE0aaa	She probably,<br>  since she is a puppy wants to be with people.<br>  Anyone else living at home??<br>  where you can keep her with them??|`|ob1NhypDaa	Read scriptures to her.|`|AA10638323	You are providing to large of an area for your puppy. You need to begin to leave your puppy in her crate throughout the day while yhou are home. It is not cruel or inhumane-it is using a dog's natural instincts to your advantage. <br>  <br>  The crate is to be a safe place, a bedroom or den of sorts.If you over coddle this puppy now and give in to her barks & demands, you will in effect create a separation anxiety problem. Just because she whines & cries does not mean you fgo and give her attention-you will actual be rewarding this behavior if you do!<br>  <br>  Rule #1 of training... ignore unwanted behavior. Reward desired behavior. Simple, yet difficult to execute.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have your puppy on a schedule-a set feeding time 3 times a day (until 6 months old) and a set bedtime. Dogs do best with training on a schedule. <br>  <br>  Also, I highly doubt you have a 100% housebroken puppy-I don't consider a dog housebroken until 3 weeks of no accidents! One accident will set a pup back 3 days in training...<br>  <br>  oh-and for all of you saying this puppy has separation anxiety at thos time-you are incorrect. A puppy at 9 weeks of age would be highly unlikely to have SA. It is more of a case of testing limits and fitting into a new family. <br>  <br>  Oh-and don't have water available at night. Puppies may get bored, spill the water, or drink it, and with tiny little bladders, accidents are more likely to happen. <br>  <br>  ringtailroxy|`|iVQULHqYaa	You did get a lot of daft answers and you will get lots more, people  will tell you to leave her to cry. The people who do this end up with and adult dog with dreadful Separation Anxiety. They poo and pee from fear and they damage everything in sight. Please try my method it's kind and it works.<br>  I have saved the following answer because this method has worked for several people,it refers to males.<br>  <br>  If you were a baby and had been taken from your mother and left alone, you would cry all night. He has been left alone in a strange place; he is frightened, confused and miserable. There are lots of adult dogs who suffer all of their lives from separation anxiety; some of these dogs belong to the people who will tell you just to let your puppy cry. Please don’t listen and don’t leave him to cry, it's easy to resolve this and its kind.<br>  <br>   Try this, it will work and both you and your puppy will have good nights sleep,<br>  Spend the next day or two conning him and having rehearsals for bedtime. <br>  After he has been fed and CARRIED out to the garden for his pees and poos, let him wander around the garden, then put him in  a room on his own with a comfortable bed.  Close the door and then immediately go back into the room and IGNORE HIM. Spend a minute or two cleaning your work tops or pretend  to be occupied with something else,  Walk out again and close the door and walk back in again immediately. Keep doing this over and over again. Eventually you can leave a short gap before you go back into the kitchen, when you know that he is asleep you can stop doing this.<br>  <br>  You must listen for him waking up and you MUST GET TO HIM BEFORE HE CRIES. Pick him up and CARRY him into the garden. <br>  <br>   Play with him and let him explore the garden. If it's time for another meal, give him this and take him out again, because he will want another pee.  Then put him into his bed, close the door to his room and start doing the door thing over and over again. <br>  <br>  This is time consuming, however it works. By the end of day one he will have been put to bed several times and he will think that you are just on the other side of the door. Continue doing this for a couple of days and he will grow up without Separation Anxiety and he will stop crying at night. My dogs have never had Separation Anxiety; I think that they think that I never leave the house. I have given this advice to several people and it has worked very quickly, I know this because I have had emails from them.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

They always blame someone else dont they?|`|iVQULHqYaa	What a coincidence that there was another Jack Russell in the pen.I suspect that your husband engineered this. Your little girl could have problems because she is too young to have puppies. Keep in touch with the vet and grab your husbands credit card, he does not deserve to profit. Perhaps he thinks that your puppy is a money making machine and does not appreciate the expense of vets fees and the fact that your b1tch could die giving birth.|`|F27az9NEaa	You should've had your female fixed at six months, why she hasn't been spayed already is beyond me.<br>  <br>  Call your vet and set up an emergency spay surgery. She is too young, not just physically but mentally to have puppies. She is still a puppy herself.<br>  I'm assuming your dog was outside in a pen? Bring her indoors and keep her indoors. Smaller dogs are better suited to indoor living; dogs are pack animals and need that time with their owners.|`|OFpl236faa	You need to talk to your vet. She is way too  young to be having puppies. Her body isn't fully developed and she is still very mentally young and may not take to raising puppies well. I would talk to your vet about your options, especially if the dog you chased off was way bigger than her. It could kill her to have puppies and it sounds like she wasn't supervised. Please spay her when you can.|`|AA12192261	cant understand why she is not spayed all my dogs are done at 6months then no ACCIDENTS|`|1QXagj4Yaa	well it doesnt matter if another dog was in the pen it only matters if she was on heat (if she was bleeding just like we have periods) these last for about 3 to 4 weeks so you should of noticed that if she wasnt in heat she cant be pregnant , dogs can only be mated if on heat, so she isnt pregnant.<br>  and the comments about getting her spayed i dont agree especially so young because if you spay them to young they emotionally wont grow up so if you do want her spayed you should get it done at 18 months to 2 years old,<br>  also i dont think that breeding puppies are money machines, as a breeder of golden retrievers i do sell mine for ￡850 each but that is only to responsible owners and we only mate our bitches once every two or three years.   I HAVE 4 BITCHES AND THREE MALE DOGS  AND THEY CAN ALL LIVE TOGETHER EVEN WHEN THE BITCHES ARE ON HEAT, THEY ARE JUST KEPT SEPERATED AND IF SOMEONE THINKS THAT WHEN THE BITCHES ARE MATED THWY ARE MATED TO OUR DOGS THEY ARE NOT WE ALWAYS GO TO A DIFFERENT MALE DOG WHO CAN OFFER SOMETHING TO OUR ***** TO GET THE HEALTHIEST DOGS POSSIBLE AND BEST SHOW QUALITY AS I SHOW DOGS.

None of that is a sin, and in the right context, can be reason to cite them for bravery and service.<br>  <br>    Dogs eat cat poop because it tastes good to them, and they're not hung about where anything comes from - surely, there is some snack you probably acknowledge is fairly disgusting and not good for you that you will eat whenever nobody is around to disapprove.<br>  <br>    Your four year old probably tastes pretty good - you haven't nibbled those little toes lately?<br>  <br>    And about the feet - how is a dog supposed to know about that?  That's your job.<br>  <br>    Hey, if this is what's really bothering you, let me point out that you seem to have a happy cat somewhere, a healthy dog, a happy kid who is loved not only by you but also your dog, one who I might add will not be plagued by a lot of diseases because he/ she will have a ton of great antibodies...and your walk isn't frozen solid like mine or you wouldn't have mud.<br>  <br>    Your frustration and the peeing on the floor part probably just mean you *all* need to go out and play.

He does this the entire time we are eating dinner. It's very funny because he won't do it when we're watching him, but as soon as he knows we're not paying attention to him anymore, he rolls the ball into the kitchen and comes running in after it, looking at us like "this dumb ball just won't stay put!".

uBFhKXgHaa	Yuck, neither! Both are low quality /crap/.<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your dog? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot. <br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent dog foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Pedigree, Kibbles n' Bits, Beneful, Ol'Roy.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Canidae All Life Stages, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timberwolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material and higher quality ingredients means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Seriously on a budget? Two of the most affordable of the higher quality foods would be Chicken Soup for the Dog Lover's Soul and Canidae All Life Stages.<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by... you guessed it, the crappy pet food companies! They also often get kickbacks from the companies for pushing these products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grain-free diet. Many of the high quality foods now put out grain-free formulas. Some good grain-free diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Canidae Grain Free All Life Stages, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, GO Natural Grain Free, Sold Gold Barking At The Moon, Ziwipeak, and Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic Select, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. <br>  <br>  If you can't find a food, most of the high quality dog food brands have websites with store locators on them that will help you find the store closest to you which supplies their products. Simply type the dog food brand's name into Google, go to their website, and type your zip code into their store locator.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing the new slowly in with the old over the period of about week or so), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies. For example:<br>  Days 1 & 2: 75% old food, 25% new food<br>  Days 3 & 4: 50% old food, 50% new food<br>  Days 5 & 6: 25% old food, 75% new food<br>  Day 7: 0% old food, 100% new food<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding dogs is to feed raw.

vJg5k342aa	Unfortunately, they very well can be dangerous.  Many dog owners indiscriminately take dogs to dog parks who haven't been well socialized with other dogs and most owners simply have no control over their dogs.  <br>  <br>  Dog parks can be great places but there is definitely an element of risk involved.|`|aa4H6qZgaa	There's always the risk of a bite, but unless she is getting torn apart by a pit bull she is going to be ok.  Make sure she has all of her shots up to date, because there are all kinds of opportunity for diseases/heartworm/etc...<br>  Usually people that bring their dogs to a dog park love their dogs and they are usually well socialized so you shouldn't have problems. Most dog parks around my house have a big dog section and little dog section, make sure you take her to the right one.<br>  On a side note the atmosphere at the dog park amongst dogs is a friendly pack, they all explore and sniff each other, there really isn't much posturing for who the pack leader is.<br>  It sounds crazy but if you're worried, sometimes if you introduce a new dog to a group of dogs butt first, they sniff the dogs butt, realize he isnt a threat and then accept him into the group.  Most fights start when dogs are too aggressive sniffing butts, or protective of their butt getting sniffed, it is all a dominance game.  They are pack animals after all.|`|NYzCYCmJaa	I personally hate dog parks. People are irresponsible and they take aggressive dog there that start fights, they they don't pay any attention to there animal.  I have a 10 year old service dog and I took her to a dog park when she was about 2 and she got attacked by a dog now she hates large breed dogs.|`|WtaM7mA5aa	First of all- it sounds like so much fun for you and your dog, but I would never take my dog there.  People bring their dogs there that have parasites, and fleas, and many other icky things.  I used to take my dogs there, but they came home with fleas, and worse of all some kind of intestine disorder.  Very expensive to treat.  My vet said to stay away from dog parks.<br>  <br>  I take my dogs up to a local baseball field, soccer field, and let them play there.  Please bring a poo bag with you and clean up any little piles your dog makes.<br>  <br>  It's your decision but I would check with your vet to see their opinion.|`|9kcFo2alaa	Sometimes they can be. Some dogs there can be aggressive and try to hurt your dog. Make sure you always have her on a leash! Be careful and watch out. You should take her as long as your or someone is there with her. It would be good for her to interact with other dogs. Give it a try! If it does not work out take her for walks in the neighborhood. <br>  Im glad I could help.|`|7izZ17ncaa	a dog park is pretty stupid, all dogs no matter what breed should be required to wear a mussel me and my pitbull have no problems at the park. But you never know there's some idiots that will take there aggresive dogs there.|`|Z9zzNYNCaa	I will NEVER take any dog of mine to *any* filthy,pest & disease-ridden "dog-park",full of nasty rowdy ill-mannered untrained beasts running loose.....not to mention their dogs!<br>  NEVER...no way in hel*!!|`|Rpj9qArgaa	YES! Filled with nasty little bacteria. You wont see me or my dogs at at dog park......ever!|`|0QTCiCf8aa	I would never go because people are not responsible enough to know when there dogs are too aggressive with other animals and/or to give there dogs the shots they need.|`|AA12128656	i don't do the dog park. germs that my dogs don't need, spoiled dogs and their idiot owners, etc. i'll just take a nice hike in the woods, thanks.<br>  <br>  p.s. dogs are prone to get bitten whether they're on the leash or off. ever hear of "leash aggression"?<br>  <br>  skip the dog park.|`|aCqSF87Raa	I've never been, but since it's a new place i would wait a while and see who goes, what reviews it gets, etc. <br>  <br>  YES there is a high chance of a fight breaking out - a lot of different people bring their dogs in, and not all of those people are responsible enough to train their dogs (or socialize them properly as pups.) A dominant dog meeting a dominant dog could become pretty dangerous.<br>  <br>  Add to that a lot of people just sit back and don't bother to watch for the signs that a fight or scuffle might be brewing. If it's an "open" park then you also have to worry about people bringing in diseased dogs OR dogs with rabies (not likely but possible) or other problems.<br>  <br>  If i were you i would check out the rules of the place. I know of several where you HAVE to be a member of some group, and whoever is in charge will actually meet your dog and require all shots, perfect behavior, etc.|`|hRikwc00aa	I take my dog to the dog park all the time - it's a great opportunity for socialization. In my town at least, no one with aggressive dogs brings their dogs to the dog park. Dominance issues do break out, but there's never been any damage done. If dogs start to get wild, the owners leash them and leave. You'll need to be on the look-out, though, as not all owners are as responsible. If a dog is bothering your dog and the owner is doing nothing, you may have to leave.<br>  <br>  Most people are good about picking up after their dogs; as long as your dog is up to date on vaccinations, she should be fine. Make sure you do your part. If water is provided there, I would not let your dog drink out of it.<br>  <br>  The first couple times you bring her, you'll want to have her on-leash or even stand outside the park with her. Even playful dogs can be overwhelmed by the sheer number and energy of the dogs.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Only well socialized and friendly dogs should be allowed at a dog park (as well as vaccinated).  Generally speaking, most responsible owners follow that golden rule.  Some dogs may show more aggression or dominance behaviors, so its not unheard of for perfectly friendly dogs to get into a couple 'disagreements' with another dog.  Its not that big of a deal though.  Its part of socialization.  As long as you keep an eye on your dog, its fine.  If at any point you don't feel comfortable, then just simply leave.  Its a WONDERFUL opportunity for lots of good socialization though.  There's no reason why you shouldn't at least check it out.  I've had wonderful experience with all the dog parks I've ever been to.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I have been to some dog parks that are great and some that I'd never take my dog back to again.  It really depends.  I would drop by without your dog a few times before taking your dog.  Get a feel for what kind of people and dogs are using the park.  Sometimes, the new ones stay nice for a while.  Sometimes though ... you just get too many idiots with their untrained dogs.<br>  <br>  I play flyball with my dog and am always out at tournies and training classes and ... all over.   So I VACCINATE my dog against things and don't worry too much about germs.  They can be a consideration, but most of these people are just germaphobes.  Most things your dog can catch he can catch ANYWHERE not just at the dog park.

Before you start adding coral you need to get a bunch of test kits for at least the 4 or so of the important parameters. <br>  Calcium, Alkalinty, PH, Magnesium.  Never add Phospate to a reef tank. <br>  Anemones require a mature very stable tank at least 6 months old.
AQsiugSpaa	Tiger,<br>  <br>  I am so sorry to read about your cat. Losing a beloved pet can be devastating, and is something that we all face as pet lovers.. and it doesn't ever get easier.<br>  <br>  Where you live and local regulations will dictate where you can bury your cat. If you have a back yard of your own, most communities will allow burial on your property.<br>  <br>  Some people prefer to use commercial pet cemeteries as they take care of all the arrangements, and if one moves out of the area, it is always possible to visit the gravesite.  You might consider a memorial service for your cat to help you with the grieving process. <br>  <br>  Here is a list of Pet Cemeteries in the United States for your convenience:<br>  <a href="http://nepanetwork.com/keepsakes/petcem1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://nepanetwork.com/keepsakes/petcem1...</a> <br>  <br>  I have always had my cats cremated, individually so I know that the ashes are those of my cat. Reputable crematoriums give certificates of proof. They usually provide the pet owner with a pretty "urn" which one can keep in the house, or there are some beautiful urns which are available depending on one's needs and taste.<br>  <br>  I think having their ashes in my home, in a way has been comforting, as they are "with me" in some small way.<br>  <br>  I send my healing prayers to comfort you and I hope I was of some help.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member: Association of Pet Loss and Bereavement|`|u7vrul2Faa	I personally think cremation would be a good idea, if you ever move house at least you can take the ashes along with you and that way you will never have to worry about leaving your cat behind.

ZT0K3q2Aaa	Shock collars are cruel, and shouldnt be used on a dog. Have you ever taken a shock collar, and tested it out on your arm or something? I did it, to test it out for myself, and ill tell you,  When you do something like that, youll see how cruel it really is.|`|nmercOm7aa	Try putting your arms up so that she will hit her head on them when she jumps. She will learn to not do it.<br>  Putting a leash on and stepping on it so she can't jump will also work. <br>  At the very least, keep a leash by the door and put it on her when the door bell rings. Then you can control her. <br>  <br>  A shock collar will not do anything good.|`|p7swtBYzaa	I find it hard to believe that a dog, any dog, who is trained properly and consistently will not stop jumping on people.<br>  You either have not been to very good training facilities or you are not consistent - as in working with the dog a lot.<br>  <br>  Seems to me you are asking for leave to hurt your dog via electric shocks.   Try it on yourself first, see if you would want that - it breaks every bond of trust you could have with your dog.<br>  <br>  Be consistent in training the dog - I have trained dozens and never had one that didn't respond to patient, consistent, positive training.   There are no short cuts - certainly not something as viciously cruel as a shock collar.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	A shock collar is generally for barking.  When the dog barks, it zaps them.  Jumping wouldn't cause the contraption to omit the shock, therefor it would be pointless.  Perhaps there are shock collars that work by remote, but I don't know.  I'd consider consulting with another trainer before deciding to use shock therapy on your dog.  Shock collars should be a very last resort.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	Shock collars don't work. <br>  <br>  Get a short leash and clip it to her collar when someone is at the door. Give her a "down" command and if she breaks it, put your foot on the leash so she can't jump and has to stay in her down position. Say "off" in a firm voice. Repeat until she holds the down command and stops jumping. Firm but effective.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	Instead of using a shock collar which is quite cruel. Look into getting a harness that prevents dogs from jumping. At pet store they have harnesses that you can put on your dog to help stop them from jumping on people by preventing them from being able to jump that way.<br>   <br>  If you use a shock collar every time that she jumps on somebody she may associate people with the pain that it causes her. This can turn your dog in to a dog that is scared of and maybe even aggressive towards people. At two year old she is still very young. Continue to work with her and never let her get away with jumping and she will learn.|`|wuPdjJfsaa	OMG!!  Don't use a shock collar.  That will make her jump more.  I had the same problem with my lab.  Every time she jumps, say "NO!" and put your knee on her abdomen and push her down.  Do this constantly, and tell your friends to do it too.|`|KuUx34hCaa	an old Technic is when or as she jumps put your knee up & bump her enough that she go down immediately & say DOWN!! or step on her toes it sounds cruel put it works just be careful not to be to rough or harsh you just want her to be uncomfortable|`|645a76d1ad797b69ad89aeb363a4270aaa	we almost had to resort to a shock collar but after research we just couldn't do. We found that over time they become ineffective and they are quite costly and can be damaged by water. I would try these things first: <br>  try hiring one of the trainers that comes to your home, they cater towards the environment and can fix the problems as they are happening.  <br>  Or as soon as she beings to misbehave try putting her outside or in a cage, a kind of "time-out", we used this step first and we found results. <br>  Another thing might be to try one of those chained collars that tighten. Put it on them put her on a leash. Then try having someone walk by and as soon as she jumps yank up on the leash. I know this seems so cruel but we had a shepherd when I was younger who had the same jumping problems but we were must smaller than your children. After my dad did the collar thing once he stopped for good.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and you get to keep her!|`|NYzCYCmJaa	I have used a shock collar.  I don't recommend then unless you are taught how to use them by a profession trainer that specializes in shock collar training.  What i would do is put a 6 foot or longer leash( not retractable) on her and step on it so she is still standing but can jump. When she jumps tell her DOWN or OFF and pull the handle part of the leash so she can't jump.   If you have any other questions feel free to e-mail me|`|aa4H6qZgaa	Shock collars aren't necessarily cruel...It does sound like you have done all of the basic steps, I can't tell how well.  For example she obviously needs a ton of excercise if she is going for walks and still that hyper.  someone needs to run long distance with her everyday or have her run next to a bike until she gets worn down.  That's my first bit of advice and probably the most important.  How long have you tried working on this doorbell scenario and how often do you practice it?  It sounds serious so you should practice every day for about an hour.  You sound like you are doing everything right in terms of ignoring her etc.  Have you also been trying to make her lay down and stay before you answer the door?  If she can't do that, you should work on that first.  In terms of the jumping a shock collar might work, i've never used it for jumping but its not going to hurt her.  She sounds like if you've tried everything i've mentioned, that she just really needs something to snap her out of her frenzy.  You can also try having people or yourself grab her front paws when she jumps and force her to stand for a long time, if you do that over and over with the doorbell practice she might not want to jump once she realizes how tired her legs get?  I was fortunate enough to be able to train my dogs by just forcing them to sit and stay, and then ignoring them when people came in.  After the person is there for a while then they can pet the dogs in a calm situation.  However i really do believe that the dog is just not getting enough energy out on walks, so i truly suggest upping the tempo/distances every day, then work on her training.  I don't know if the shock collar will do much if the prong collar didn't slow her down.  A last resort you might have to call a dog specialist in to help train her...|`|tcEyuvlxaa	DO NOT GET A SHOCK COLLAR!!!! i have had all kinds of dogs, 2 shih Tu's, 3 bichon frises, a old english sheep dog, several labs, and an english bulldog.. it sounds like your dog does not think of you as a dominant person.. i would try working on that first.. also this is a very hyper dog and it is a puppy, it sounds like it needs regular exercise. try walking it in the morning and evening and keep working with the jumping.. please don't get a shock collar.. those are horrible!! and you have to be a MONSTER to put that on a dog!!!!! please just be patient with the puppy!!!!!|`|yLkSov8maa	I don't believe in any of that stuff- shock collars,prongs,etc. This is training your dog and the item becomesa "alpha" in a way. i tried bark collars and the didn't work! I have corrected it myself and after only a week after doing it myself (compared to months of the collar) I got much better results. Corect her by telling her to heel or sit. Make sure she does this and when she is calm pet her. YOu don't have to turn your back, just walk away. DOn't talk to her and acknowledge her when she is behaving well.
wrUsMG4Jaa	This may not work for your dog, but my dogs get scared out of their mind when they have the hiccups. <br>  <br>  When my dogs get the hiccups, I engage them in a running activity.

7sb7QqAEaa	Its hard to tame birds if you have more than one. Try taking the other out in another room to play with in the evening for about an hour and then put him back in the cage before taking the other out. If you do this everyday it will help tame them because right they are bonding to each other rather than you. Give them little treats when you play with them like mozzerlla cheese, pits of crumbs, baby food fruit, or seeds.<br>  <br>  Seeds or millet are like candy to them- which is why birds should be on an only pellet diet.
AA11263354	Cats are super fickle. It sounds like she just has a short fuse, she just doesn't want to be petted by certain people at certain times.  My cat is the same way sometimes and I have 2 kids.  So basically we have all just come to learn that if he wants to be petted, he will come to us.  Sometimes cats just don't have a playful or passive tempermant.

33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	I recently got a lab puppy and when we first brought her home she seemed depressed as well. She even shook every once in awhile. After some time it all stopped. We just chalked it up to the fact that she was with all her brothers, sisters, mom, and dad then suddenly taken away by us. Now she's better, full of energy and very loving. I wouldn't worry about it unless she's not eating, or is having bathroom problems. If she seems depressed and isn't eating I would suggest bringing her to the vet.|`|vpeZTL9Laa	It must not like you.|`|KkKCKu06aa	I'm not sure how old 'puppy' really is.<br>  but when we gout our second basenji to join our female. he was lost and confused for a few days. couldn't lay down and sleep without jerking at a noise or when someone touched him.<br>  he also seemed depressed.<br>  <br>  are you sure it's not just his face?|`|KWSzx2ZLaa	Give your puppy lots of attention and warmth (maybe more than the other two)! Let her sleep in your bed or sit next to you on the couch.  Does she seem not to like the other dog or cat, if nott then she may just be sad from leaving her mom, but she will get better!  If nothing helps ask your vet what to do.  Also, you could see what makes her happiest (walks, treats etc.) and do that alot!  Hope she gets better!!|`|u93oneUXaa	She's not depressed.. she's probably overwhelmed by everything right now. New place, new people, new animals... she will come around!|`|uTIoOa62aa	:/|`|S3yvKorwaa	Oh dont worry just give her some time and im sure she will come around soon<br>  What type is she?<br>  <br>  Here is a real good way to bond with you puppy! :]<br>  <br>  ::<br>  Step1 Spend one-on-one time daily with your puppy. The time that you spend interacting with your puppy will help strengthen the bond and improve your relationship. <br>  <br>  Step2 Walk your dog daily. Not only will this give your puppy the exercise that it needs, it will also help him understand that you are in control. Controlling your dog on his leash will help him learn to respect your leadership. <br>  <br>  Step3 Groom your dog on a daily basis. Either brush your puppy or give him a full-body rubdown. Be sure to handle all four paws. The contact between you and your puppy will create a strong bond. <br>  <br>  Step4 Stroke, pat and gently groom your puppy. While doing this be sure to talk in a calm soothing voice. The relationship between you and your puppy will grow strong because of times like these. <br>  <br>  Step5 Reward your puppy for good behavior. The reward will reinforce the puppy's behavior and will strengthen your bond. If your dog's behavior is unacceptable, be clear and firm in your reprimand.|`|INogJe2Oaa	Hey there it would just be getting used to be in a new place make sure that the other dog is not been mean and that he might also be scared off the cat<br>  just give all the pets the same love and just keep a eye on the puppy eating as in a new place he/she might not eat|`|DQsyrDHUaa	How long have you had it?<br>  It may just be that it is still trying to adjust to the new environment.<br>  thats funny because you would think the others that have been there would be the ones upset that you brought a new animal in the house.<br>  Try giving it some extra attention, make sure its up to date on all its shots and everything, that there is no chance it is sick!|`|fYaEMGPEaa	give the puppy a lot of attention.. spend as much time as possible playing with her. <br>  <br>  this will make her feel at home.. she is probably depressed because she feels awkward  and has not adapted yet to the home.. <br>  so do anything that will make the puppy feel at home like: playing, feeding.. and other attention.|`|hqaSMGD7aa	She's probably just nervous about being in a new environment.

(i hope! lol)|`|CaG5qOJWaa	Give it some time.. she will eventually start getting used to it. It's a new environment and like us, humans,  it takes time. Just keep cuddly and paying attention to your new pet. Tender, love, and care is what she needs.

Then it would sit at the bottom of the cage and get pooped on.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt give a parakeet a pickle. Now Honey, they might like. <br>  <br>  They are extreme bird-brains, Parakeets.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	I don't think a pickle would be very good for a parrot, I would bet the parrot would stick his tongue out taste it, and then shake his head and walk off. Find other good snacks to offer your parrot, save the pickles for yourself.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I don't think it will be ok to give a parrot a pickle cause of the spices it might hurt them and it has salt in it and you can't feed any birds that has salt or sugar in anything|`|Oz3QEbIWaa	no you can't because the juices will upset it's stomach and it will get sick!!!!!!!!!!!|`|frE1TKsIaa	NO, dont give it. the seasoning, brine and not to say the high salt content is BAD for your bird!
BJERgbM5aa	Your otocilclus is a breed of catfish found in S.America.  Also know as a sucker catfish.  They're bottom feeders and love to hid in the sand.  If he was sick, than it's entirely possible that the others picked him off, little by little, while he has burried or hiding.|`|HRHPmjtVaa	I doubt that he ate him....Is he in the filter? In a cave? Hope I helped!|`|M3pjhIecaa	He could have died and he is hidden under some rock cave or anything that would not be obvious as they like to hide away, it maybe that hes just hiding away somewhere for the same reason. <br>  I've lost fish as big as 8in and never found the carcass as something has dragged it away and devoured it. So its not a drama if you can't find it however, keep checking your water parameters as a dead fish will pollute the water quickly.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	Oto cats are a very sensitive fish.  It's common for them to die within the first few days.  I bought 2 last year, and I took extra care to adjust them to my tank water and took a good 2 hours to let them adjust before adding them to the tank.  One died within 45 minutes, the other lasted a few months.<br>  <br>  Keep looking around, they are pretty good at hiding since they're so small.  The guppy would only be able to eat it if it had died.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .
7sb7QqAEaa	Generally parakeets perfer a nesting box- which is a very big square shaped box to say the least. If she insists laying on the floor- then allow her to do so. However supply her with alot of good nesting material so the eggs wont get too dirty. I really suggest that you cut index cards into shavings because if the birds dont have something stable to grip when their chicks they can grow up to have leg problems.<br>  <br>  Once the eggs have hatched, give them a few days before you try to move them around to get a good look at them. Remove the broken shells, and change the nesting material everyday to keep them from getting dirty.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Since Carla choosed the floor instead of the nest box for laying her eggs, keep her on the floor.  She's comfortable there so let her be.  The only thing you need to be aware of is that you won't be able to clean the cage with your parakeet laying on the floor with eggs.  As long as she is sitting on her eggs, she will be able to keep them warm.  To help her out, I would make sure she is in a warm room with no drafts.  I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any good websites for this specific information.

Maybe start with a antibiotic ointment OTC.  But depending on the severity, I'm not sure.  Good luck.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Even your local vet could suggest a good antibiotic salve.
DBFcwexYaa	Call around and see if yu have some type of wildlife rescue or bird rescue if so they will come out for free and come take the bird and raise him back to health. you can not just leave the bird most likely it will not live if you leave it just because it is not stable and low in health.|`|9e4cc937385b500f07dcfe521561dfc1aa	Just put out a bowl with seeds and another bowl with water and maybe a wrapped up towel just in case it wants to relax there and stay warm.<br>  <br>  But, your backyard sounds safe but I hope no cats can get in or dogs since the bird cannot fly.
3O6CTb3saa	Hi this is either a genetic defect or an injury when growing up it sounds like to me.  Does he limp at all in a walk, trot or gallop?  The major problems will be the stress on the knee.  If the hoof turns outward i would say the leg is crooked from the knee down too.  This will eventually put stress on his knee and shoulder.  I don't know how old he is but if he's already 7 or so he will start to show problems in later years depending on how much you ride him and how crooked the leg is.  He probably will never be able to be an event horse or jumper due to the knee.  This is all without seeing the leg of course.  You could have him seen by a vet and they can tell you better.|`|5kUxkun3aa	did you have him vetted before you bought him?<br>  it could be that he has not had a good farrier. or he could have been born that way. get your vet to x-ray.<br>  get a good farrier to trim him up. you don't say how old he is.but we have had extensions put on youngsters feet to help correct some problems with the foot.<br>  you have got to watch for bone problems. we had a youngster with a bit of a club foot that he ended up with really bad ware and tare on his joints.|`|eJ60hSICaa	you need to get his hooves trimmed by a farrier i don't know my number but my horses hooves get done for 30$ all four hooves|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Just depends on how bad it is.  It could cause some issues if you are planning on using him alot.  It may make it more difficult for him to lope to the left than to the right etc.  So he would not be able to do say reining or jumping most likely.  But if you are just going to use him for pleasure he should be ok.<br>  <br>  We had a gelding here for training  a year back and he to had a crocked front leg.  He did ok, but I did have to take it into consideration, and it did affect his movement to the left to a certain degree.  But his owner just enjoys trail rides and riding for fun so he is fine for that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jenny<br>  <br>  Edit: thanks for the pics.  It would be easier to see better if he were standing square. Can you take any more of him square an standing out of the grass?  But it doesn't look that bad to me at all.  I have seen alot worse.  He sure is a cutie. and I love the picture where he is holding a stick, I have an 18 year old horse who still does that.  very precious.|`|iz03uvV4aa	Yes - it all depends on how extensively his "turn-out" is.  The more turned out, the more limited his work load can be.  Truly, any stenuous work for a horse who is severely turned out can be very long term damaging.  Of course, its like running on your own leg that was slightly deformed. More stress = more pain.  But there are plenty of horses with turn in and out issues that are perfectly sound.  It really depends on where it comes from and the severity of it.|`|5i8lDbXfaa	Here is some info on  conformation flaws.  I would have a vet and farrier look at him to see if it can be fixed, sometimes these can be fixed by certain procedures.  A filly at my old barn was born with a crooked leg and during her first 5 months of life the leg worked itself into proper position.  We think this was from her being in an awkward position inside her mom.  But still some things can be fixed, so don't rule out everything.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/conformationfaults110299b/" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...</a><br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/conformationfaults110299c/" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...</a><br>  <a href="http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health/anatomy/conformationfaults110299a/" rel="nofollow">http://equisearch.com/horses_care/health...</a><br>  <br>  Wow!!

LSz1IT6Eaa	One of my dogs had to have two surgeries before she was 3.  It has been almost a year since her last surgery, and first now she is finally back to herself.  It was a traumatic surgery, and just took a while for her to fully recover, physically and mentally.  Give her time and love and she should be fine.|`|AoSeHXeQaa	I dont think there is anything else in that area that they could have removed by mistake.<br>  However, she may have had a bad reaction to the anaesthesia, or one of the medications she was given.  Dogs can have allergies, just like humans.<br>  <br>  Have you asked him for a list of the medications he used?<br>  I would do that, and investigate the possible side effects.  Not that there is a lot you can do to change her current condition, if that is the case, but you need to know what to avoid, if she ever needs surgery again.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	Its most likely that the surgery was VERY traumatic for him. Someone might have really hurt him.<br>  But there could have been something like a rag left inside of him or something. There could also be an infection.
GVR9AjoQaa	Check your saddle pad for "sharpies"- he may be getting poked by his pad & consequently have a tender spot on his back.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	You need to get a vet or equine physio to check where the pain is.|`|eCwQYrNgaa	I think you assume the saddle fits him but I bet if you take him and the saddle to a saddle fitting clinic you would be amazed.  Horses can't talk our language but we can learn theirs, he is talking to you loudly about this problem.  <br>  One of the things I would do is contact a chiropractor and an acupuncturist.

65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	YES call the vet ASAP and tell them your dog may have eaten!  It will be fine to wait for the surgery, a hernia is not life-threatening.<br>  When an animal (or human) is under anesthesia, reflexes are stopped, including the gag reflex.  This means that you can't swallow.  Muscles relax, including the cardiac sphincter, which keeps the contents of the stomach from flowing up the esophagus.  If there is food in the stomach during anesthesia, there is a risk that it could flow up the esophagus and into the lungs, causing aspiration pneumonia, which can be deadly.<br>  Call NOW!|`|DdHhNpR3aa	Don't be to worried about him going #2. I would let the vet know that he may have eaten something that way they are prepared if anything happens or they can do his surgery later in the morning. The reason they don't want him to have eaten is because the sedative makes animals queezie and if they vomit before the swollowing reflex comes back it makes it possible for the dog to inhale vomit causing inhalation phneumona. So let'um know.|`|qapJU3tMaa	You are worried because your dog didn't poop in the house?  That's gross and disgusting!!!!    Wow, your house must smell horrible. <br>  <br>  I doubt that your vet will do the surgery if your dog ate that morning.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you need to worry more about teaching your dog to do it's business OUTSIDE!|`|ZzlrBlCjaa	I would call the vet and tell them that there is a possibility that he ate something and that you aren't sure and then let your vet make the call. As for him not pooping overnight, I don't think there's a problem ... maybe he's just learning to hold it better ... thats what happened with mine ... he used to poop in his crate overnight but at around 8 months old ... he just stopped doing it. Hope I helped :) Good luck. I hope all goes well with your little guy
zqVDJxUIaa	They have bad reputations because some inexperienced aquarists keep them alone, or in groups less than 5, since they think that they look pretty, but the truth is, if you keep them in groups of 4 or less, they will begin to nip the fins of other fish. If they are kept in large groups, then they will be content to just play around and nip their own species, which doesn't result in any harm. Black Skirts and Serpaes are both 'bigger' tetras, they get along fine for 2 reasons:<br>  <br>  -You have both of them in a large group;<br>  -And those two are roughly the same size.<br>  <br>  Serpaes are often said as 'semi-aggressive', because they WILL nip at neon tetras, angelfish, or any other fish with long, flowing fins.<br>  However, they won't nip at bigger fish, or bottom dwellers.<br>  <br>  I've kept small groups of Serpaes as well as large groups, and I've actually never had a problem with small groups (about 4).<br>  I have a tank with 5 serpaes, Black Phantoms, catfish, and even Platys! (they never bug each other)<br>  <br>  I think it's just a common misperception that Serpaes are bad fish: they're great!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|h4wNRqf9aa	Because people seem to think that 3 tetras makes a school<br>  <br>  If you don't keep them in natural conditions how can you expect them to behave naturally?|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Probably because other people have had bad experiences with them.<br>  <br>  They are probably kept in tanks that are too small, or not in a large enough group which instigates their fin nipping.|`|yV8fog7Paa	I have noticed with my 4 (10gal, waiting to add them to my 55gal until cycling is complete and goldfish are moved) that whenever I got a fish they bullied them. The more serpae's you have the less fin nipping among the other fish.

Hamsters (and other rodents) are completely defenseless against us, except biting, and they usually bite, some even when they ARE being abused.

Rw7gi86Naa	When cats groom each other they are showing that they have a special bond, (as well as helping each other clean those hard-to reach spots like top of their heads and neck). When our cats lick us, it's a similar sign; that they have accepted us as a part of the family and want to take care of us and show they care.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	If she's licking you in the morning, it means one of two things- <br>  A) she's hungry and wants you to get up and feed her<br>  -or-<br>  B) she's bored, and since you USUALLY get up soon anyway, this would be a fine time to play.|`|8qF4urLLaa	I think it's a way for them to get what they want.

be58a957ec05b08ab61416f8ea457867aa	If you know what you are doing as far as training then you don't need the tutelage of an instructor in class. But, as the first post stated, classes also provide socialization and a chance to learn to behave around distractions. If you will make the effort to provide for those things outside of the structure of a class then that is fine. You will be a rare specimen, though. In my experience, pups rarely get as much exposure as they need without attending classes.|`|DdHhNpR3aa	Do what you are comfortable with, I always keep an open mind and if you go to the class and hate it you don't have to go back. I think training is a good thing for owners and pets because it helps with bonding but more for socialization for the dog. I had my first pit bull for 10yrs and raised him from a pup, the best thing I ever did for him was to socialize him, he got along with everyone and he was loved by all. The earlier you do that the better. Good luck and please make your new fur baby an ambassador for the breed.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	Puppy classes aren't just about training, they are also about teaching a dog to listen with distractions, and getting a start on socialization.

It does not matter the breed of dog, all puppies should go to a puppy class so they can socialize with other puppies. From there she should be exposed to as many dogs as possible so she does not develop problems with other dogs, such as leash aggression or outright dog aggression. This part is the important part for Pit's since there are so many out there that come from irresponsible breeders who don't have a care in the world for anything besides making money off the puppies. <br>  <br>  Taking her to class doesn't mean you can't train her at home. You can do both.|`|Wtad1fC5aa	Usually yes, especially because its a bonding experience between you and your dog.  ultimately you want him to listen to you and be familiar with following instructions from you so if you dont have experience in this already it can be more beneficial to have assistance in being able to master your dog (especially bc pitbulls are very dominant and strong so they have to be taught WELL before they get too big and you cant physically overpower them anymore) and your dog also gets to socialize with other dogs in a safe environment and learn by example. And its actually pretty fun, but if you have experience with dog training then go for it, if not puppy classes wouldnt hurt.|`|sgEazAn2aa	I took my dog to a puppy class called Narnia.

1Qh9i9cWaa	I would definitely place her in the breeding box already. Make sure to acquire a breeding box that has a apparatus within that can separate the mother from the babies; the mother fish has been known to eat her own fry, its better to be safe than sorry. <br>  <br>  sooner or later she is probably gonna stay near the bottom of the tank is due to the change in environment. She is a pregnant fish in an unfamiliar area; this can be resolved by placing her in the breeding box, thus eliminating any possibility of the other fish from attacking her - weakness in any fish is seen as target to other fish, and by adding stress coat into the aquarium - this will help her relax. <br>  <br>  You can acquire this solution at any pet store. However, make sure to pour the solution indirectly from the fish, direct consumption can lead to death. Otherwise, good luck on your future|`|mnufOa6eaa	No she is not being bullied. The male, regardless of the fact that is pregnant, is trying to breed with her. No, she will not be hurt. <br>  <br>  Just an FYI, it's not a good idea to have 2 male livebearers with 1 female. If you want more than one male, you really should have at least 3 females so the males are less likely to fight over them.|`|QV6swGUMaa	get a breeder net and ya should buy another 2 or 3 females so your males dont stress her out that much when she has the fry.3 females to 1 male is the ratio ya should have to stop the females from being stressed at the least 2 to 1. good luck|`|dE5fs9yzaa	Get a breeders net and put her in it. Two males to one female is the wrong ratio...the males will bother her all the time and she will never get to rest! Put her in the net..with a little plant cover if you want the fry to survive. You need to either get one or two more females or trade in one male for a female or get rid of the female and go with males only.
KEYgd73saa	You're seeing a bacterial bloom, which is almost unavoidable in newly setup tanks.  Fish produce waste in the form of ammonia, which nitrifying bacteria oxidize (essentially consume) to form nitrite.  When large amounts of ammonia are present, because you just added new fish, the bacteria can multiply rapidly, which causes cloudy water.  The bacteria are harmless-- and actually NECESSARY for a healthy tank-- but the ammonia and nitrite that allow the bacteria to bloom ARE harmful.  You need to keep up on your water changes to keep your fish alive, and you may want to invest in test kits (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate at the very least) so you can know when your fish are in trouble.<br>  <br>  Cycling info: <a href="http://fishlesscycling.com/forum/index.php?topic=1945.0" rel="nofollow">http://fishlesscycling.com/forum/index.p...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/Nitrogen_Cycle.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.americanaquariumproducts.com/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlore.com/NitrogenCycle.ht...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.algone.com/cycle.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.algone.com/cycle.php</a>|`|pW0jU9gUaa	Did you put sand or gravel in the bottom?<br>  If you did, did you rinse it?<br>  If you didn't that might be your problem, try doing another water change, but the clouding should just settle.

So it's unlikely you'll be able to buy a share without an adult to sign the deal so to speak.  Sorry hun|`|lTeXIjpOaa	i've never heard of a minimum age before on owning a racehorse, but im in harness racing|`|Pn9tPYKbaa	i dont think thur is an age you have to be to own  a race horse lol.<br>  oh lol, are you talking about betting on it?? lol if so, i have no idea lol. sorry|`|RloOJ43haa	As with almost all legal contracts, 18.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	I'm pretty sure you have to be 18 to enter into any legal contract on your own.<br>  Kath

Unless these two birds have ever actually had fertile eggs and/or hatched chicks, there is no guarantee that one is a male.  They don't need a male to lay an egg.  Only to lay a fertile egg.  When you truly have one each male and female, they will take turns sitting the eggs but it would be very rare for them to fuss about it.  Usually the male will sit during the day and the female at night while he "stays on guard".  That is the instincts from the wild and it holds over in many of our pet birds.  Unless they get to the point they are hurting each other, don't worry about it.  Just be sure they have a never ending supply of cuttle bone available to them.  If they do reach a point where they are too serious about it, you could try putting shallow bowls in the cage, lined with paper towels and put one egg in each.

Other places of business - it's up to the store owner.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Howdy neighbor (I'm in Warren).  No, you can't bring  your dogs into any store, even if you carry them, unless it is a store such as Pet Supplies Plus, Petco, Pet Smart, or the like.  The only dogs that are allowed in stores and shops are registered service dogs, such as a leader dog for the blind, etc.|`|1XLZdOcQaa	It's always up to the stores to let you do that. Some stores are super-seensitive with pets being around while others don't really mind the presence of  some furry friends around. <br>  <br>  Best bet is to check before you even try to stroll down any store to avoid getting barred at the door. <br>  <br>  Dog Parks are the bestplaces for your lovely fidos. <br>  <a href="http://www.elfurl.com/lbmqf" rel="nofollow">http://www.elfurl.com/lbmqf</a>|`|Bw18seFqaa	If the store sells or serves food.. NO.. it doesnt matter how small your dog is, if its in a purse, etc..  Only SERVICE animals are allowed.  That is a health code violation to bring dogs to a store that sells food.<br>  <br>  Any store that does not sell or serve food.. its up to the store owner's discretion.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to be told to leave some of the stores if you bring your dogs.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Dogs do NOT belong in stores and most do NOT allow it unless they are service or seeing eye dogs.|`|TInJIfKfaa	Only the shop owners will be able to tell you that...

mnufOa6eaa	Depends on what you mean. Pit bulls contrary to ignorant belief, are not a "bad to the bone" breed. As long as they are, bred, raised correctly and trained properly, they can make loving, loyal pets just like any breed.|`|QVP8zSuWaa	How in the heck would we know?|`|024f046dd145f6d7ab314e8ad45af5f8aa	yeah what do you mean? a little more info may help us but i don't see why not. i have 2 pits one since a pup and the other a rescue. they are both great dogs raised with love. and contrary to belief they are loving loyal dogs. they are what you raise them to be.
R3E8DkTfaa	What the hell was your 4 year old doing with a shot glass full of gin??<br>  <br>  If it was actually poured in the tank, the fish may or may not die.  It's not that much alcohol when you consider how much it is going to be diluted by the 10 gallons of water, but you should do a water change as already advised to be safe.  <br>  <br>  Frankly I think that you did it yourself, and are blaming  your 4 year old because you don't want to sound stupid.  Too late, because it would definitely fall under the category of stupid to let a 4 year old have access to a shot glass and gin.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Alcohol was used to euthanize fish in the past. Perform an emergency 50% water change.<br>  <br>  (Assuming you are not a troll)|`|mOayTJDmaa	It's not in the tank.  And I doubt you will find it like the previous answer.  Your child drank it.<br>  But it doesn't hurt to change some water.|`|kwdjgn8Maa	take the fish out as soon as you find the alcohol, and change the water.  Also run water over the rocks and fake plants, just to be safe.|`|ExlBKnRGaa	most likely the fish would be dead if there was ANY alchol in there. BUT CHANGE THE WATER JUST IN CASE!|`|yT9QnQxmaa	yeah change the water and give sum time for the fishes to hang loose cuz they are getting dreezy^
