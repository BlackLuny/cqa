People don't have to spend as much on those nasty fossil fuels to warm their homes.  The extra CO2 is great for plants and is the stuff that all life is made of.  Unlike many things that humans produce, CO2 is entirely good for the planet.  It is only people with agendas that need to reinvent science to call that a pollutions which is about as twisted and stupid as saying water or oxygen is bad.

During most of the past 2,000 years, the temp has been about the same or higher. Currently, we are barely over the average for the last 2,000 years.<br>  <a href="http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index.php/2008/02/11/a-2000-year-global-temperature-record/" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldclimatereport.com/index....</a><br>  <br>  2. During the medieval warm period (820 – 1040 AD), Greenland supported farming. The Vikings settled in this land. They remained on Greenland until the climate again cooled and the expanding ice sheets forced them out. This would suggest that not only is the current glacial melt not catastrophic, but part of the natural cycle.<br>   <br>  3. The earth experienced a little ice age which ended around the late 1860's or so. This is about the time man started recording temperatures. This would be like measuring a lake depth after a severe drought, then worrying about it flooding as it rose to normal levels.<br>  <br>  4. The earth has been warming for the last 18,000 years, since the last major glacier time period. During this time frame, the glaciers have been melting at a fairly consistent rate. Also, for most of the last 1 billion years, the earth had NO glaciers or ice coverage.<br>  <a href="http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/ice_ages/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/i...</a><br>  <br>  5. The AGW theory states that CO2 is the primary driver of temperature. They arrived at this idea because they did not know of anything else which could cause it. But during the 70's and during the current decade, temperatures dropped while CO2 continued to rise. This means that natural occurrences are driving temp, not CO2.<br>  <br>  6. The Pacific Decadal Oscillation and sun spots provides a much better correlation to earths' temperature than CO2 levels ever have.<br>  <a href="http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/2008/01/25/warming-trend-pdo-and-solar-correlate-better-than-co2/" rel="nofollow">http://wattsupwiththat.wordpress.com/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://strata-sphere.com/blog/index.php/archives/5693" rel="nofollow">http://strata-sphere.com/blog/index.php/...</a><br>  <br>  7. Polar Bears are experiencing a population boom. Coke sales in the arctics are through the roof. Polar Bears have been around for thousands of years, and remember, we are only at the average for the last 2,000 years. They lived through all the previously warmer climates. The original picture of 2 bears on a floating ice block was a complete scam. The photographer explained that the bears were in no danger and close to shore. The picture was lifted from a public PC by another passenger and sent around the world. <br>  <br>  8. Many glaciers are expanding. Even Antarctica is growing on 98% of is land mass. Only 2% is melting.<br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1577399/Christopher-Booker%27s-Notebook.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  9. There is no consensus on AGW. This was a lie that has been propagated by the media.<br>  <a href="http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckton_papers/consensus_what_consensus_among_climate_scientists_the_debate_is_not_over/page-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://scienceandpublicpolicy.org/monckt...</a><br>  <br>  10. Yes we emit CO2 into the atmosphere and it is a greenhouse gas, but, we only contribute about .28% of all the greenhouse effect. Water vapor makes up about 95% of the greenhouse effect. CO2 and other trace gases round out the greenhouse gases at about 5% for all of them. Of that 5%, only 3% is CO2, and most of that is natural. Again, our contribution to the greenhouse effect is a paltry .28%<br>  <a href="http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenhouse_data.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocraft.com/WVFossils/greenh...</a><br>  <br>  11. The spread of disease is not attributed mainly to temperature. If this were the case, Florida would be a giant festering disease ridden cesspool. Economic standing is the primary determining factor in the spread of disease. Poor cultures can not fight the disease or eradicate the pests like more successful nations.<br>  <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120778860618203531.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries" rel="nofollow">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB12077886...</a><br>  <br>  12.

UtHnh0aHaa	All bi-products are manageable even in the current ecosystem crisis.<br>  The key is how systems to recover and use methane on a farm can be put in place at a rate fast enough to reduce or solve the problem. Methane is just natural gas in it's raw form. If a dairy farmer can gain economic benefit by capturing it and burning it in his generator to produce electricity to run his milk pumps, use the excess heat to pasteurize his milk and then sequester the carbon from the exhaust to improve the potency of his soil for growing feed - he will do it!

There is a huge danger from an overly aggressive Monsanto that sells most of the farmers seeds and patents genes and is attacking people for growing their own seeds.  The lack of diversity and making people pay because their farm was visited by bees that transported Monsanto genes is sick and stupid.  There is no real problem with GM though the potential exists.  There is a huge problem when a multinational business goes after family farmers because their safflower seeds were crosspollinated and puts them out of business.

9OHskZrhaa	Electricity is produced by burning coal and natural gas primarily. (Whereas petroleum goes mostly to transportation) See the breakdown at: <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/diagram1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eia.doe.gov/aer/diagram1.html</a><br>  <br>  These fossil fuels release Carbon Dioxide and other greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere when burned. This Carbon has been sequestered and effectively removed from the Carbon cycle for millions of years. As we mine and burn it the total carbon on earth increases. This decreases the pH of the ocean and traps more energy from the sun (Global climate change, ocean acidification) at a relatively rapid rate. Many worry that there are various tipping points that will accelerate the changes. (like methane released from a melting permafrost, the change in albedo of the planet with and ice free north pole during the summer, or various other things you can look into). While these kinds of changes are totally normal for the planet, they aren't for us, and we will have to adapt to the changes over the next few decades. Most likely, the poor will be more negatively affected than the wealthy.<br>  <br>  The mining process is also potentially hazardous to human health and the environment (eg. mountain top removal mining, sludge spills <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/23/tennessee.sludge.spill/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/12/23/tenness...</a> )<br>  <br>  Saving energy ideally decreases demand for electricity, and therefore the amount of fossil fuels mined and burned. But power plants produce at fairly constant rates, so we will only have an affect if we collectively reduce demand and increase efficiency over the long term. Turning off the light doesn't literally reduce CO2 emission in real time.

Biodegradable materials are a liability when buried and burned but an asset when composted.”<br>  <br>  The report asserts that “A zero waste approach based on preventing waste and expanding reuse, recycling and composting is one of the fastest, cheapest, and most effective strategies to protect the climate.” It also notes that, per megawatt-hour, a trash incinerator produces more carbon dioxide emissions that a coal-fired power plant. Incinerators also waste three to five times as much energy as recycling helps to conserve.<br>  <br>  “A zero waste approach is not only good news for climate stability, it’s also good news for America’s businesses and economy,” said Eric Lombardi, a report co-author and director of the Boulder, Colorado-based Eco-Cycle.<br>  <br>  “Stop Trashing the Climate” urges a local and national 20-year goal of zero waste.

3zGnJEvSaa	Polui??o Sonora<br>  <br>  Com o crescimento desordenado das cidades e o surgimento das grandes indústrias, as pessoas passaram a conviver com a polui??o de lagos, rios e das próprias metrópoles. Nesse cenário, um outro tipo de polui??o que n?o pode ser visto e com o qual as pessoas de certa forma se acostumaram pode ser considerado um dos maiores problemas da vida moderna: a polui??o sonora.<br>  <br>  A polui??o sonora se dá através do ruído, que é o som indesejado, sendo considerada uma das formas mais graves de agress?o ao homem e ao meio ambiente. Segundo a OMS - Organiza??o Mundial da Saúde, o limite tolerável ao ouvido humano é de 65 dB (A). Acima disso, nosso organismo sofre estresse, o qual aumenta o risco de doen?as. Com ruídos acima de 85 dB (A) aumenta o risco de comprometimento auditivo. Dois fatores s?o determinantes para mensurar a amplitude da polui??o sonora: o tempo de exposi??o e o nível do barulho a que se exp?e a pessoa. <br>  <br>  A perda da audi??o, o efeito mais comum associado ao excesso de ruído, pode ser causado por várias atividades da vida diária. Há por exemplo, perda de 30% da audi??o nos que usam walkman, toca-fitas ou laser disk durante duas horas por dia durante dois anos em níveis próximos de 80 dB (A). Calcula-se que 10% da popula??o do país possua distúrbios auditivos, sendo que, desse total, a rubéola é responsável por 20% dos casos. Atualmente, cerca de 5% das ins?nias s?o causadas por fatores externos, principalmente ruídos.<br>  <br>  O ruído de transito de veículos automotores é o que mais contribui na polui??o sonora e cresce muito nas grandes cidades brasileiras, agravando a situa??o. <br>  <br>  No ambito doméstico, a polui??o sonora ocorre pela emiss?o de ruídos acima das especifica??es produzidas por eletrodomésticos.<br>  <br>  O ruído industrial, além da perda organica da audi??o, provoca uma grande variedade de males à saúde do trabalhador, que v?o de efeitos psicológicos, distúrbios neuro-vegetativos, náuseas e cefaléias, até redu??o da produtividade, aumento do número de acidentes, de consultas médicas e do absenteísmo. Segundo a Sociedade Brasileira de Acústica, os níveis de ruído industrial nas empresas brasileiras s?o absurdamente excessivos.<br>  <br>  Essa situa??o pode ser revertida aplicando-se as tecnologias de controle de ruído existentes, que envolvem o desenvolvimento de produtos específicos, recursos para identifica??o e análise das fontes de ruído, previs?o da redu??o de ruídos através de programas de simula??o e o desenvolvimento de máquinas menos ruidosas.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Legisla??o Ambiental - Polui??o Sonora<br>  <br>  <br>  Por se tratar de problema social difuso, a polui??o sonora deve ser combatida pelo poder público e pela sociedade, individualmente, com a??es judiciais de cada prejudicado, ou coletivamente, através da a??o civil pública (Lei 7.347/85), para garantia do direito ao sossego público, o qual está resguardado pelo artigo 225 da Constitui??o Federal.<br>  <br>  Na legisla??o ambiental, polui??o é definida no art. 3, III, da Lei 6.938/81, como a degrada??o da qualidade ambiental resultante de atividades que, direta ou indiretamente, prejudiquem a saúde, seguran?a e o bem estar da popula??o; criem condi??es adversas às atividades sociais e econ?micas; afetem desfavoravelmente a biota; afetem as condi??es estéticas ou sanitárias do meio ambiente; lancem matérias ou energia em desacordo com os padr?es ambientais estabelecidos.<br>  <br>  A Lei 9.605/98, que trata dos crimes ambientais, em seu artigo 54, configura crime “causar polui??o de qualquer natureza em níveis tais que resultem ou possam resultar danos à saúde humana...”, o que inclui nesta figura delituosa a polui??o sonora pelas conseqüências que produz, como dito. <br>  <br>  A Lei 8.078/90 do Código do Consumidor, proíbe o fornecimento de produtos e servi?os potencialmente nocivos ou prejudiciais à saúde (artigo 10), podendo-se considerar como tais os que produzem polui??o sonora.<br>  <br>  A Resolu??o 008/93 do Conama estabelece limites máximos de ruídos para vários tipos de veículos automotores.|`|Naj456Huaa	Horrível,,, as pessoas deviam ter mais aten??o a isso,, e ter também mais respeito pelos outros!!<br>  ...Por vezes fazem cada barulho insuportável,, e completamente desnecessário!!!!|`|WZEjOngWaa	é ruim para os ouvidos.

O super aquecimento faz com que as geleiras dos polos norte e sul derretam rapidamente e a consequencia é o aumento do volume das águas do mar. Já naquela época falava-se em um provável desaparecimento das cidades da orla marinha, como o Rio de Janeiro por exemplo. O problema é que as pessoas n?o creem no que os cientistas dizem, e os que que creem mas tem interesses financeiros ligados a polui??o do nosso sistema, n?o est?o nem aí!

A conven??o sobre a biodiversidade tenta resolver isso mas é difficil <br>  <br>  para provoca e brincar um pouquinho  ... se temos que parar isso (biopirataria)  .. sera que o Brasil vai parar de explorar os ramos economicos resultados da biopirataria do passado ? ou seja parar de :<br>  <br>  plantar café ( vem da Etiopia )<br>  plantar soja ( asia)<br>  plantar cana de a?ucar ( asia)<br>  para de criar gado ( nelore é da india )<br>  para de criar mangueiro ( incrivel mas a manga é nativa da da india e birmania <a href="http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_%28fruta%29" rel="nofollow">http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga_%28fr...</a> )<br>  etc ..<br>  <br>  Se isso existe no Brasil é o resultado de uma forma obvia de biopirataria ... complicado ..n?o é para o Brasil...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ibap.org/direitoambiental/artigos/gjpf062000.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ibap.org/direitoambiental/art...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Nacionalismo, Xenofobia e Prote??o das Florestas Tropicais<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Guilherme José Purvin de Figueiredo<br>  <br>  Professor de Direito Ambiental (Fac.Saúde Pública USP - Direito USF)<br>  <br>  Procurador do Estado de S?o Paulo - Presidente do Instituto<br>  Brasileiro de Advocacia Pública<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No início do mês de junho deste ano de 2000, os debates se centravam em torno de uma falsa notícia apócrifa veiculada na Internet, segundo a qual as escolas norte-americanas estariam usando mapas com o Brasil dividido ao meio e a Amaz?niaLegal definida como "área de controle<br>  internacional". O preocupante boato chegou até mesmo a dominar um encontro de militares de alta patente, segundo nos informava o jornal "O Estado de S?o Paulo" de 13/6/2000.<br>  <br>  Surpreendentemente, tal boato encontrou ressonancia até mesmo na voz de juristas cuja idoneidade moral e espírito cívico e democrático jamais foram contestados. Pronunciamentos xenófobos por parte de aguerridos militantes da causa ambientalista chegavam até mesmo a<br>  sugerir que a Amaz?nia poderia se transformar num palco de guerra ao estilo da do Vietn?. E, o que era pior, tais discuros chegavam a empolgar muitos colegas que, aparentemente, n?o percebiam que nada há<br>  de mais anti-ambiental do que uma guerra, já que guerra é a nega??o da vida.<br>  <br>  Desde o primeiro momento alertamos que a denúncia sobre o tal mapa baseava-se em mensagens apócrifas via email e pedimos a todos que atentassem para nossos verdadeiros adversários: a quem interessa relacionar patriotismo com direito de devastar a Amaz?nia? Ou "imperialismo yankee" com preocupa??o mundial pela preserva??o dos recursos planetários?<br>  <br>  é evidente que o episódio do falso mapa norte-americano interessava em muito, naquele momento, à bancada ruralista. Era o ingrediente preciso para que todos se voltassem contra a luta dos ambientalistas pela preserva??o de nossas florestas. Nada como invocar um nacionalismo retrógrado e ufanista ("os norte-americanos v?o sentir<br>  saudades do Vietn?") para levantar a opini?o pública contra aqueles que se preocupam com a prote??o do meio ambiente.<br>  <br>  Aquele episódio n?o pode ser esquecido e dele devemos tirar algumas li??es. N?o podemos cair em jogadas rasteiras. As indústrias dos EUA continuam sim degradando o meio ambiente, destruindo o que resta da natureza. S?o sim as grandes responsáveis pelo aquecimento global e<br>  pela destrui??o da camada de oz?nio. Isto, porém, n?o significa que o povo norte-americano seja responsável por esse estado de coisas.<br>  <br>  Assim, se estamos lutando por um planeta ecologicamente equilibrado, devemos nos unir à luta dos companheiros ambientalistas de todos os países. Ainda que boateiros norte-americanos venham um dia a sair por aí dizendo que nos mapas brasileiros o Parque de Yellowstone, nos EUA<br>  figure como latifúndio improdutivo a ser invadido pelo "Exército Revolucionário Haeckel-Sandinista" ou qualquer coisa nesse sentido.<br>  <br>  De qualquer forma, é um alívio saber que o embaixador Anthony Harrington tenha qualificado tais rumores de "mito grotesco" os rumores de que os EUA estariam promovendo a internacionaliza??o da Amaz?nia.<br>  <br>  O movimento ambientalista n?o se harmonizará jamais com discursos xenófobos, pois todos sabemos que a degrada??o ecológica n?o conhece fronteiras. Vale observar que concomitantemente com o lan?amento de<br>  tal boato, come?aram a circular em Brasília panfletos acusando o WWF e o Greenpeace de serem agentes do imperialismo...<br>  <br>  N?o podemos abrir m?o do direito de lutar pela preserva??o do meio ambiente, seja no Chile, nos EUA, no Zaire, na China ou no Brasil, sejamos nós chilenos, palestinos, australianos, belgas ou suazilandeses. Isso n?o significa que queiramos invadir outros países mas, apenas, que queremos salvar o planeta.

Vários remedios, formam patenteados no exterior, e o Brasil n?o pode sequer comercializar a planta. Chama-se de biopirataria.<br>  <br>  Existe uma aldeia no amazonas cercada pelo exercito americano, onde apenas pessoas autorizadas entram na área. Nem policiais do brasil podem entrar. Provavelmente esteja sendo feito estudos com indios para a descoberta de novos remedios.<br>  <br>  Existe outro fato polemico, sobre a apresenta??o do Brasil em mapas de alguns países, o amazonas fora do continente brasileiro, pior q se trata de livros de estudantes extrangeiros.<br>  <br>  Os investimentos bélicos n?o param de crescer, china, USA, ir?, isrrael, india, korea.

Ci43NmWFaa	Oh o gas metano só é produzido na digest?o de animais que ruminam no caso vacas,bois,touros, bufalos,... mas o metano também encontra-se nos pantanos,por conta da materia em decomposi??o, Mas quanto aos peixes creio que eles soltem pum sim kk<br>  <br>  Beijinhos Gabi!|`|AA12005596	De acordo com ictiologistas da University of Guam, flatulência em peixes por si nunca foi estudada, apesar de que houve pessoas que investigaram a digest?o em peixes. Eles acham que apesar dos peixes terem ambientes intestinais alcalinos, como os nossos, peixes que comem corais devem ter conteúdos intestinais ácidos. O ácido serve para dissolver o material esquelético do coral, que é feito de carbonato de cálcio, tipo Tums. Um produto da rea??o entre ácido e carbonato de cálcio é dióxido de carbono, que é gasoso. Ent?o, pela lógica, peixes que comem coral devem peidar muito. Os outros peixes provavelmente também peidam, pelas mesmas raz?es por que nós peidamos. <br>  <br>  Além disso, provavelmente o ar n?o poderia ir para a bexiga natatória ao invés da abertura anal. Mesmo naqueles peixes que têm a bexiga conectada ao trato digestivo, que n?o s?o todos, essa bexiga está conectada mais próximo à boca, e esses peixes enchem a bexiga com ar engolido na superfície, ent?o provavelmente o ar do sistema digestivo tem outro fim.|`|d3731c70588be4860bd61aaed1166262aa	kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk, n?o sei n?o porque nunca estudei nada sobre os peixes n?o, fica difícil saber se eles soltam gás como os humanos e as vacas, mais te prometo que vou dar uma pesquisa-da nisso,você mim deixou curiosa agora.kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk... se eles peidam e poluí meu querido estamos fudidos porque a quantidade de peixes que êxito é muito grande.kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk,  imagine  as vacas e os peixes peidando juntos.kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk|`|0NFL0mppaa	Pergunta interessante... mas creio que sim... todo mundo faz isso...|`|pvBIfjiuaa	acredito que sim!<br>  Afinal se ele come,ele caga ,ele haverá de peidar mais cedo ou mais tarde...
