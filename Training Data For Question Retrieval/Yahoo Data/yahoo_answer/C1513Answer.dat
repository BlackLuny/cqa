Shows your bias is pretty overwhelming. <br>  Let's answer a few of your questions and replace a few of your dialog parts, shall we?<br>  The reason why heterosexuality is natural is because of species' design. A species is designed to survive, or adapts to survive. If you believe in evolution, yet also believe that homosexuality isn't a choice (biological, thus) then you're contradicting yourself. By evolution, homosexuality would have died out, period. Think about it; homosexuality is basically committing suicide as far as evolution would judge it.<br>  So here's where we are right now. You either now admit that homosexuality is a choice, and evolution exists, and you lose the argument. Or, you argue on, and say that perhaps evolution doesn't exist, and that humans were created or became to exist spontaneously, or through God. Either one, you're still going to lose. You go with a spontaneous theory, and you're committing logical suicide once again. Intelligence comes from intelligent design; a definition of intelligence that man has always held. DNA is a language. Period. We came from something that knew a f*ck load more about this universe than anyone could ever try to. Know why we can't prove that there's a God beyond a reasonable doubt? Because God wouldn't have it that way. He wants us to have enough faith to just go with it, and trust the hundreds of millions of people that have done so already. <br>  You know what I'm tired of? Bias.

JWs say Jesus is really the archangel formerly known as Michael, and that "Holy Spirit" is just a feeling God can spread around.

38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	The Catholic Church is the reason that Christianity survived the persecution. Without the apostolic succession of the Popes and the solidarity of the Catholic community, Christianity would have died in the arena at the hands of the Roman empire. <br>  <br>  Here is the list of all Popes from the very beginning of the Catholic Faith:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12272b.h...</a><br>  <br>  The Church taught and still teaches God's truth. That's why we have endured persecutions, heresies, and constant attacks without splintering into various groups, each with their own version of the "truth."<br>  <br>   Ask yourself this: if Martin Luther was teaching the truth, then why was he rabidly anti-Semetic? Why did he feel the need to curse Catholics and Catholicism every time that they came to his mind? Why did he ignore the warning in Revelation and both add to the Bible (the word "alone" to "faith," for example) and remove books from it? <br>  <br>  And most damningly of all, why did he tell his own mother not to leave the Catholic Church if he was so certain that he was right? All of these things can be verified, and when they are added up, they paint a much different picture of Luther than the kindly old reformer battling the evil church that most people have when they think of him.<br>  <br>  The fact that Protestantism has split again and again while the Catholic Church has remained intact should tell you which group has clung to the true Faith of Jesus Christ.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Well, I see the usual fundie BS spread thick again. The Eternal Church has always taught the truth, and She always will.

If the Catholic Church started 300 years after Acts, there would be little or no evidence of Catholic beliefs.  All early Christians of the 1st 3 centuries  were Catholic, and the overwhelming evidence is there for anyone who wants to see it. <br>  <br>  Making blind assertions out of malice with no documented evidence is wrong, cruel, and hateful.|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	The reformation resulted in a number of legitimate administrative reforms throughout the Catholic Church, but nothing in the way of doctrinal changes.<br>  <br>  The Council of Trent reaffirmed the constant teachings of the Catholic Church ... teachings that were clearly a part of authentic Church doctrine since (at least) the first Christian Pentecost, about 34 AD.<br>  <br>  Protestants conveniently ignore the authentic Christological and historical basis of the Catholic Church, just as they reject Catholic sacred tradition, since acknowledging them would completely invalidate all of non-Catholic Christianity.<br>  <br>  That's also probably why they continue to lie about it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/who-to-believe/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/who-to...</a>|`|zefFTf8Aaa	the Catholic church did teach the truth before luther and has continued to do the same. **suzanne** yeah, some bishops and priest have strayed from the church's teachings.  the church never said people couldn't read the bible.  only about 10% of the people could read, the church was keeping the bible from being stolen.|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	The Church always has and always will teach religious Truth. Official dogma is infallible and cannot be changed, ever. Jesus told us that nothing, not even Satan, will ever conquer His Church. See Mt. 16: 18-19.<br>  <br>  This however, does not mean that the human beings who lead the Church will be infallible themselves. All priests go to confession on a regular basis, especially the Pope. The Pope only teaches infallibly when he declares official Church Dogma. Like all human beings, he too can and does sin. I'll agree, that the Church has made mistakes in it's history. But, bear in mind that imperfection is only a part of human nature!
sU4rOiO5aa	G C, you mentioned the human brain. How come the Bible does not mention the human brain, which is arguably the greatest creation in the universe???

Gosh, some people are really silly. Abandon your useless mythology and superstition and dare to exist in the real world.|`|Vw1REpBKaa	Well i personally don't believe in God because there is no proof of his existence. I think it is smarter to learn about history, science and your surroundings rather than to just ignore it all and rely on 'faith', because in my opinion that is just a lazy excuse for not wanting to use your brain and learn.

Most of what I have read on the subject indicates a strong genetic component, but enviornmnet also plays a strong part. Parental involvement and early childhood stimulation can increase IQ significantly.  <br>  <br>  And I am trying to be polite tonight, so I won't speculate upon your genetic make up.... though I will remind you that Genetics was discovered by a Catholic Monk by the name of Gregor Mendel. Google it.) <br>  <br>  <br>  In any case, I'm not that smart. I did make it into MENSA on the basis of my ACT and SAT scores back in the 80s. That puts me at about 138 on the IQ test (note that's a REAL IQ test, not the on line ones that give everyone who takes it a 174). I also have a law degree, but unlike you, I'm NOT to smart to believe in God.  Mainly because I've seen God work miracles, with my own eyes.<br>  <br>  So you must really be smart.<br>  <br>  Being as smart as you are, I'd suggest you read, and then cleverly dissect, St. Thomas Aquinas' SUMMA THEOLOGICA. <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/summa/" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/summa/</a><br>  Aquinas is often considered to be one of the greatest philosophers in the history of Western Civilization. He has 5 proofs of the existance of God in there, based on pure logic. Being as smart as you are, I bet you could make him look a dumb ox. <br>  <br>  As a warm up though, you might want to start by taking apart mathematician Kurt Godel's version of St. Anselm's Ontological Proof for the existance of God. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del'..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del'...</a><br>  <br>  This is another good link to it <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/p...</a> <br>  <br>  I'm sure you know all about it, but for the folks who might read this and aren't as smart as you, here's the history of the Ontological Proof. Saint Anselm (1033-1109) English theologian and archbishop of Canterbury presented the proof. René Déscartes (1596-1660) French philosopher and mathematician improved Anselm's proof. Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz (1646 – 1716) German philosopher and mathematician improved Déscartes' proof. Charles Hartshorne (1897-2000) Professor of philosophy from the University of Texas (1962-1978) worked on logic of Saint Anselm's proof from 1923 in his Harvard Ph.D. thesis to 1965 that he wrote its revised version of the proof in his book "Re-examination of the ontological proof for God's existence". Kurt G?del (1906 - 1978) German professor of mathematics in Princeton University improved Leibniz's proof. Melvin Fitting professor of mathematics and logic in the City University of New York, Lehman College improved G?del's proof and formalized it with third order modal logic.<br>  <br>  I'm sure you will be able to make mincemeat out of those ignorant fools with that planet sized brain of yours. <br>  <br>  Now understand that To understand the proof it is required to gain knowledge of the following subjects first. One can obtain the knowledge by reading books or choosing the easier path of going to the nearest University, Math or Philosophy departments and taking necessary logic courses. List of some necessary books that cover the prerequisites can be found in the reference section.<br>  <br>  Prepositional logic <br>  Predicate logic <br>  Proof trees <br>  Modal logic <br>  Possible worlds semantics <br>  Mathematical set theory <br>  <br>  BUT...you were probably doing that straight out of nursery school.<br>  <br>  So go for it smart guy... enlighten the rest of us!|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	Micah 4:12<br>  But they do not know the thoughts of the LORD; they do not understand his plan, he who gathers them like sheaves to the threshing floor.<br>  <br>  Believing oneself smart does not necessarily translate into action and wisdom is developed.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	I believe in God|`|AA10641825	Yeah but what if they convert you?|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	I'm too smart NOT to believe in God, the Almighty, Creator of the Universe.

I'm christian too and I know its hard but the fact that you are christian is really important because gay and lesbian relationships are against of what Jesus made ad permitted. As a christian you should talk to your cousin and tell her that you think she should think about what she is doing and tell her that God has big plans with her but He won't be able to accomplish them in her if she picks wrong. You can only try to advise her but remember that she is the one who is going to decide, tell her you say this to her because you love her and if you can invite her to church and try to talk to her about God. Its really hard but ata the end no matter what happens remember that if you talk to her about God, when you go to heaven God will honor you for sharing his word with other people. Satan is going to use any situation he can to make you sin and try to make you think gay and lesbian marriagee is alright but there you show you're a true christian. So before you do anything, pray for wisdom and ask God to tell you what to say and talk to your pastor if possible for advice. I'll be praying for you as well, God Bless U!!! <br>  P.S. Don't get fall for group pressure!! Be a radical christian!!

AA11120822	Basic morality stems from empathy, which is a product of survival instinct. Don't kill or hurt others, don't steal, don't lie. That sort of thing.

The Jews ripped off the Code to write their Ten, adding the spooky language of the "no false gods" and "keep the sabbath holy" stuff. <br>  <br>  Stealing, killing, and raping are wrong because they hurt other people. So does telling lies about others. <br>  <br>  As for honoring parents: That's all well and good in a perfect world, but sometimes parents are just dishonorable. Respect and honor should be earned, not automatic. <br>  <br>  Atheists are restrained by the rule of law and societal expectations.

DVDYDaVSaa	Wow, you attempt to clarify things by making untrue statements.  Polygamy had nothing to do with supporting widows "on the prairie," as it was started years before the migration to Utah.  Many of Joseph Smith's plural wives were not only not widows but were currently married to other active mormon men at the time.  A few others were teenage girls who had parents who could support them.  This is documented in your own church's geneaology records and personal accounts.<br>  Smith didn't write the BOM when he was 14--it wasn't until years later, and he was not the simple ignorant farm boy he's portrayed to be.<br>  Yes, mormons support each other, as long as "each other" are active mormons.  Question or try to leave the church and see how much support you get.<br>  If you're happy with it, be my guest, but at least learn  the truth about it before you try to convince other people.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Thank you Drew. Unfortunately those people who are against the Church will continue to believe that only the Church's critics can have the 'real' truth. <br>  <br>  And, Diane the Succubus, have you ever read Spaulding's manuscript:? I have, and there is no similarity to the Book of Mormon. In fact, the story goes that it was given to Sidney Rigdon, who then took it to Joseph Smith and they conspired to copy it and call it the Book of Mormon. Only trouble is, Rigdon had not heard of nor met Joseph Smith until a year after the BoM had been published. When the Bom was being published, Rigdon was organising his own church. There is also the View of the Hebrews by Ethan Smith, which come claim that the BoM was copied from. Again the manuscript has no similiarity to the BoM and no evidence that Joseph had ever seen or heard of that manuscript either. <br>  <br>  As a member of the LDS Church, my studies of anti-Mormon literature has led me to some interesting finds which support the Church. Such as the consistent use of Hebreisms and chiamus used in the Book of Mormon, which people of the US in the 1800s would not have known about as even European scholars were just barely rediscovering them. Then there's the Isaiah in the BoM. There is more in the BoM than can be found in the Bible. And it is more complete than the Bible's Isaiah and most importantly, a large portion of the Isaiah found in the BoM matches the Isaiah found in the Dead Sea Scrolls which were not discovered until over a 100 yrs after Joseph Smith's death. And that would also be 100 yrs after the Spaulding Manuscript and The View of the Hebrews. The only place that Joseph Smith could have obtained these scriptures would have been from ancient writings containing them. And please do not make fun of the translation methods used. When God wants something translated, he will provide the means, no matter what anyone thinks of it.<br>  <br>  I always find it suspicious when someone claims to be a former member of the Church either does not know the Church's beliefs and history or is purposefully telling untruths about it.|`|NxPPdCSjaa	That was well written! Thank you!<br>  <br>  Now for ---Ray---- You sir know nothing of that which you speak! Mormons do not support Polygamy in any way! Period!

Most  have been Married  in the temple!<br>  <br>  Now if you are a Christian, here is a Challenge for you: <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are Christian as are Mormons then you believe in the Ten Commandments! They say Thou shall not bear False wittiness. This being the case, how do you justify your answer above?<br>  <br>  Waiting for an answer!<br>  <br>  Edit for ----Dan----- I have never known of any Catholics preaching against Mormons although I have heard of a few isolated cases but that is not a problem, I have many Catholic Friends and I am Married to a Catholic!

mVTGl6HGaa	An igloo (Inuit language: iglu, Inuktitut syllabics: ???, "house", plural: iglooit or igluit, but in English commonly igloos), translated sometimes as snowhouse, is the Inuit word for house or habitation,[1] and is not restricted exclusively to snowhouses but includes traditional tents, sod houses, homes constructed of driftwood and modern buildings.[2][3]<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>  [edit] Igloo as a snowhouse<br>  Inuit village near Frobisher Bay, an illustration from Charles Francis Hall's Arctic Researches and Life Among the Esquimaux, published in 1865<br>  <br>  When referring to a snowhouse, igloos are shelters constructed from blocks of snow, generally in the form of a dome. Although igloos are usually associated with all Inuit, they were predominantly constructed by people of Canada's Central Arctic and Greenland's Thule area. Other Inuit people tended to use snow to insulate their houses which consisted of whalebone and hides. Snow was used because the air pockets trapped in it make it an insulator. On the outside, temperatures may be as low as ?45 °C (?49.0 °F), but on the inside the temperature may range from ?7 °C (19 °F) to 16 °C (61 °F) when warmed by body heat alone.[4]<br>  <br>  [edit] Traditional types<br>  An igloo's snowbrick laying method.<br>  <br>  There were three traditional types of igloos, all of different sizes and all used for different purposes.<br>  <br>  The smallest was constructed as a temporary shelter, usually only used for one or two nights. These were built and used during hunting trips, often on open sea ice.<br>  <br>  Next in size was the semi-permanent, intermediate-sized family dwelling. This was usually a single room dwelling that housed one or two families. Often there were several of these in a small area, which formed an "Inuit village".<br>  <br>  The largest of the igloos was normally built in groups of two. One of the buildings was a temporary structure built for special occasions, the other built nearby for living. These might have had up to five rooms and housed up to 20 people. A large igloo might have been constructed from several smaller igloos attached by their tunnels, giving common access to the outside. These were used to hold community feasts and traditional dances.<br>  <br>  [edit] Modifications<br>  <br>  The Central Inuit, especially those around the Davis Strait, lined the living area with skin, which could increase the temperature within from around 2 °C (36 °F) to 10-20 °C (50-68 °F).<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Construction<br>  An igloo sideview diagram; opening to the right, optional window may be composed of an ice block. Dark-yellow signifies ground (which however, may also be ice or snow).<br>  <br>  The snow used to build an igloo must have sufficient structural strength to be cut and stacked in the appropriate manner. The best snow to use for this purpose is snow which has been blown by wind, which can serve to compact and interlock the ice crystals. The hole left in the snow where the blocks are cut from is usually used as the lower half of the shelter. Sometimes, a short tunnel is constructed at the entrance to reduce wind and heat loss when the door is opened. Due to snow's excellent insulating properties, inhabited igloos are surprisingly comfortable and warm inside. In some cases a single block of ice is inserted to allow light into the igloo. Architecturally, the igloo is unique in that it is a dome that can be raised out of independent blocks leaning on each other and polished to fit without an additional supporting structure during construction. The igloo, if correctly built, will support the weight of a person standing on the roof. Also, in the traditional Inuit igloo the heat from the kulliq (stone lamp) causes the interior to melt slightly. This melting and refreezing builds up an ice sheet and contributes to the strength of the igloo.[5] The sleeping platform is a raised area compared to where one enters the igloo. Because warmer air rises and cooler air settles, the entrance area will act as a cold trap whereas the sleeping area will hold whatever heat is generated by a stove, lamp or body heat.

e599f8e9840310f064e7afa7423bfa60aa	Jesus did magic, right?  Walking on water, raising the dead, the water into wine bit.  So, if he did it, it must exist.  If it exists, then there is a secret to it.  Wiccans may just know the secret.

Wicca is not about spells.  Wiccans believe in magic, but what they consider magic may or may not have anything to do with what you're thinking.  Real magic is generally not something that produces visible, showing effects.  This is real life, not Charmed.<br>  <br>  In addition, believing in magic has nothing to do with believing in God.  There are Christians who work magic.  Wiccans do not believe in God as Christianity describes him for a variety of reasons, often simply that they ahve seen no reason to believe in him.  Wiccans also have experience with a multitude of gods, which directly contradicts the Christian assertion that there is only one.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I believe there is a god listening to the prayers of the Christians.  I just see no reason to think the Christians have all of their facts right.  He's not the only one.  And that's the benefit of the doubt.  I have no experience personally informing me he exists.  however, I also recognise that my lack of experience in no way proves he doesn't exist, just as a Christian's lack of experience with my gods in no way proves they don't exist.  The Christians have their god, and I have mine.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	Wiccans are not the only ones who practise witchcraft, Christians do too, people of every faith practise witchcraft. <br>  <br>  And Wiccans (most anyway) do believe that there is a God and a Goddess.<br>  <br>  And if you're a Christian, you really shouldn't say that magic and spells aren't real considering the Bible says there is.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	You don't have to believe it.

Okay, so you think magic isn't real-- good for you. Just remember that most religious rituals, including Christians ones, are just another form of magic... specifically prayer. <br>  <br>  I could show you a video of someone working magic. It won't be what you want to see, because what you want to see isn't what magic really is about. Convincing you that real magic is being worked would likely be pointless.<br>  <br>  And by the way... Wiccans DO believe in a God, last time I checked. A Goddess, too. ;] Might want to do your research next time.|`|jo6pKDF9aa	Why single out wiccans?

mVTGl6HGaa	Hwang Jin-i (1520c.-1560c.), also known by her gisaeng name Myeongwol (literally bright moon), is the most legendary gisaeng of the Joseon Dynasty who lived during the reign of King Jungjong. She was noted for her exceptional beauty, charming quick wit, and extraordinary intellect. Her personal life has become almost myth-like, having inspired movies, a 2006 TV series, operas, and numerous novels. Due to her renowned assertive and independent nature, she has become a modern popular cultural icon of Korea.<br>  Contents<br>  [hide]<br>  <br>  [edit] Works<br>  <br>  Although only a handful of sijo and geomungo pieces exist today, they nonetheless show skilled craftsmanship of words and of musical arrangement. Her sijo often describe the natural beauty of Gaeseong and its famous sites such the Palace of Manwoldae and the Bagyeon Pokpo waterfall. Others hint at the tragedy of her lost loves. Some are also responses to numerous famous classic Chinese poems and literature, the majority of them reflecting on lost love. Two of her most famous sijo are:<br>  <br>      "??? ??? ??.."<br>  <br>          ??? ??? ?? ? ??? ?? ??<br>          ?? ?? ?? ???? ????<br>          ??? ?? ? ???? ???? ???<br>  <br>          Oh that I might capture the essence of this deep midwinter night<br>          And fold it softly into the waft of a spring-moon quilt,<br>          Then fondly uncoil it the night my beloved returns.<br>  <br>      "??? ???(靑山裏 碧溪水)?..."<br>  <br>          ??? ???(靑山裏 碧溪水)? ?? ?? ?? ??.<br>          ????(一到滄海)?? ?? ?? ????<br>          ??(明月)? ???(滿空山)? ? ???? ???.<br>  <br>          Respectable Byuk Kye-Soo, do not boast of leaving so early.<br>          When you venture out to the sea, it will be difficult to return.<br>          The full bright moon above the empty mountain, how about staying here to rest.<br>  <br>  [edit] Popular culture<br>  <br>  In the late 20th century, Hwang Jin-i's story began to attract attention from both sides of the Korean divide. Her life has been depicted through media including fiction, film and opera. Novels dealing with her life include a 2002 novel by the North Korean writer Hong Sok-chung, which was the first North Korean novel to win an award in the South. Another novel, by South Korean writer Jeon Gyeong-rin, became a bestseller in 2004. In late 2006, KBS released a TV series entitled Hwang Jin-i starring Ha Ji-won in the title role. A film starring Song Hye Kyo was released on June 6, 2007.

The way to do this is through documentation - if you can track down a copy of your great-grandparents' ketubah (marriage contract), or find your great-grandmother's grave in a Jewish cemetery along with your grandmother's birth record proving that was her mother - those are the most common ways.  Since the evidence is in Europe, this is harder, but still possible, and there are even organizations that specialize in doing the detective work to help people in your exact same situation.  The documents you already have may even be enough, and if not, they are a wonderful starting point - you're lucky, many people in similar situations don't have anything at all!<br>  <br>  If you really feel the pull, start attending synagogues until you find one that works for you - standard Orthodox is very different from Chassidism (and Lubavitchers are different from Breslovers who are different from Satmar, just to name a few).  Get a closer look, and you may find one resonates more than the other - and once you feel comfortable, speak with the rabbi.  If he is unwilling or unable to help, contact Chabad (even if you decide not to follow the Lubavitchers, they consider it their mission to bring Jews back to the fold, and would absolutely help get you in touch with people who could help you on your quest - it might not be free, but it would not be prohibitively expensive, as they would see it as doing a mitzvah).<br>  <br>  If you can't find documentation, you would have to go before a beis din in some sort of conversion if you wanted to marry a Chassidic, mainstream Orthodox, or even Conservative Jewish man.  The process might not be as involved or take as long as a standard conversion, but they would see it as necessary so that the status of any future children you might have is not in question.<br>  <br>  What a great story!  Lots of luck (and welcome home)!|`|FNRnqrZAaa	My first instinct is to say that you would need to convert, if only to be safe, but I'm not sure.<br>  <br>  Of course, if you're serious, starting by living like an Orthodox Jew is one of the best steps you can take on your own. see what it's like and the commitment it'll take and then if/when you're absolutely sure and more accustomed to it, find a synagogue and a rabbi near you that you feel comfortable with and discuss it with them.|`|O7xQhwm9aa	you might very possibly be Jewish. if your mother's mother was Jewish - and you have proving documents, then you are too (it goes by mother, not father). <br>  if you are, the best thing would be to contact chabad.org -they are the biggest lubavich center, and they are very helpful. tell them what you want and may you have success.|`|LIGYejglaa	Can you prove that your mother's mother was Jewish? That would be the only way. If not you will need to convert. I suggest looking for documents that would show your mother's mother's mother was Jewish; many European synagogues still have, or are attempting to rebuild, their membership records. If your story is true, it would be laborious to find records, but they would be available.<br>  <br>  By the way, there is no statute of limitations on maternal descent. The notion is ridiculous.<br>  <br>  ETA- Since I don't know what kind of documents (proof of her parents' marriage? pictures of her father praying in tallit and tefillin? gravestone in Hebrew? brother's bar mitzvah?) I can't tell you, but you should make an appointment with Chabad (they are the easiest to talk to if you're starting from zero) to talk to the rabbi about it and show him your documents.

I consider the question "what caused the universe" to be of the same kind - meaningless question.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Natural processes.<br>  <br>  If you think about it honestly, it's much more likely that matter and/or energy always existed than that an infinitely powerful being capable of speaking a universe into existence always existed.

The second requires magic.<br>  <br>  The fact that you can't explain something does not mean that it is unexplainable.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	How can you explain it poop into existence without the supernatural. <br>  <br>  So who pooped God out?|`|fjMJJnCUaa	Theists... <br>  <br>  How can you explain God, did it poop into existence. How can you explain it, without the supernatural reason of how it got there. Either it came into existence supernaturally, or it was always here supernaturally. Without a reason ( supernaturally). If you think about it for a while you will see that the universe is a miracle. Either way, it is unexplainable. What do you think?<br>  <br>  Supernatural is a retarded fucked up concept. <br>  <br>  God told me to tell you to **** yourself. ( God speaks to me ).<br>  He also told me that your a douche bag and that chrisrianity isn't real. He made it for a laugh.<br>  <br>  That is God's word. He is with me now.|`|AAAw24KOaa	Time is a property of the universe.  You can't have a before-time, in which the universe was "pooped" into existence.  Nor can you have an after-time.  You have what is and will always exist.  By definition, time and existence are eternal.  Neither can not NOT exist.<br>  <br>  Do you ever remember being before your birth?  As time is a product of the universe, observed time and memories are a product of your mind.  There has been a set time since you were born, but you (as you perceive yourself) have always existed.<br>  <br>  That's my take anyways.|`|fWWYc2UZaa	Umm.. I don't really care.

Islam practices a restricted (to four wives) form of polygamy.<br>  <br>  The practice of polygamy is currently prohibited by law and by an official declaration in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons). This was the result of the supreme court declaring laws created by congress to seize all property of the Church and its members and declare them outlaws and to de-incorporate the Church. The first amendment was basically ignored by both the Supreme Court and the Congresses that passed the laws.<br>  <br>  Rather than face total annihilation of his Church, the Lord (through revelation) rescinded his requirement. Because of those laws the Church made the decree universal to members throughout the world, regardless of where the member lives.<br>  <br>  Can you imagine what such laws, if made today, would have on the Muslim world? Those laws are still in effect, but I don't know if they are imposed upon Muslims. Marriages are now governed state-by-state, so the situation is that FLDS cannot practice plural marriage in Utah without risking discovery and prosecution under anti-bigamy laws.|`|TzY9vkinaa	The FLDS is not the restored church, they broke off from the restored church and do not have the proper priesthood authority.<br>  <br>  Mormons don't practice polygamy any more because God said so.<br>  <br>  "The family is ordained of God. Marriage between man and woman is essential to His eternal plan. At certain times and for His specific purposes, God, through His prophets, has directed the practice of plural marriage (sometimes called polygamy), which means one man having more than one living wife at the same time. In obedience to direction from God, Latter-day Saints followed this practice for about 50 years during the 1800s but officially ceased the practice of such marriages after the Manifesto was issued by President Woodruff in 1890. Since that time, plural marriage has not been approved by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and any member adopting this practice is subject to losing his or her membership in the Church." <br>  If you're interested in reading more about the LDS church and polygamy click on this link <a href="http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=bbd508f54922d010VgnVCM1000004d82620aRCRD&locale=0&index=16&sourceId=9887ec6f164b2110VgnVCM100000176f620a____" rel="nofollow">http://lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?vgnext...</a>|`|FyLfEPv0aa	The true restoration had continuing revelation.<br>  <br>  The FLDS is focused on one doctrine only and that's polygamy.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	The LDS church stopped practicing polygamy so that Utah could become a state.

3bbtzjBuaa	1.) Do you know what socialism is?<br>  <br>  2.) If it's impossible for a quick fix, then why are you attacking an administration after less than 2 months, while making no note of the last 8 years, which were clearly not socialist and probably 5 times as damaging?  How can you determine that it's HIM making it worse, when you can't say why the market has dropped AND admit that these things do not correct themselves overnight?<br>  <br>  3.)  It's funny that you speak of the deficit - he still has 4 years (excuse me, 3 years, 10 months) to make a change, and there was no way to get out of this economic climate without spending anything.  If we started with a surplus, and he has doubled the deficit, then that necessarily means that he has not cost the country as much as Bush did, and anything moving toward the black (color of pen, not people...as opposed to being in the red), constitutes a change for the better, no?  It took more than 2 months to get in the mess, you recognize that it can't change overnight, and yet you somehow have only given Obama two months to "right the ship" that he is not the sole captain of (did you forget how long it took Congress to pass the bill?  Or the fact that it's only been signed for a matter of weeks?).<br>  <br>  The markets notoriously don't know how to deal with Democratic leadership because Democrats are typically more concerned about the people who voted them into office as opposed to just the people who have money.  It only takes a statement for the market to drop, because people are unsure, but ultimately the drops due to such statements pale in comparison to the rises or falls that are due to how the economy is actually functioning; Wall Street assumes policy and functional changes through statements and reacts, but when looked at in a larger picture, it's the policy and how it works out that gives us a better idea of where the market is at.<br>  <br>  It's going to take time, but you won't give it time.

We haven't had anything like this since the great depression.The republican party slashed taxes for the wealthy only. During his administration the salary's for a working man decreased. The profits for the wealthy increased.The 750 billion $ bail out for the banks only gave more money to the wealthiest americans. Did nothing for the average american. Then those banks gave out large bonuses, took a 440 thousand $ retreat, had a very elaborate super bowl party, even ordered 50 million $ jet(obama put a stop to the jet), that's just to name a few of their choices.  The list goes on & on. Then when Obama got in office he was handed a complete mess, america was in massive debt & the only people benefiting were the wealthy which happens to be a very small % of the american people. So Obama passed a bill to help people, people down on main street not people on wall street.People like you for some unknown reason seem to be ok with giving large bonuses to wealthy ceo's to reward them for financially destroying the country. But seem to be offended by a president who passed a bill trying to help the average american. By giving them things like food stamps,medical care, & unemployment checks. By trying to invest so there will be some jobs in the future. 9 thousand people a day in america are losing there homes. I bet you live off your parents, which is why you don't have a clue. They just told you how to think & so as not to lose there financial funding you did as told, also voted as told. If you have time educate yourself.Stop being a follower.

Maybe a denomination that will at least let you write your own vows, which could leave God out of, and you could possibly do it outside a church. If he is really willing to you could even go for something like a Unitarian Universalist church. That has Christian roots but isn't  anymore.<br>  <br>  You have some tough conversations to make. Avoid having someone feel pressured, that may lead to resentment and issues later. This isn't going to be the last time religion comes up, so you need to figure out how you will deal with these things. He should be able to accept your beleifs. It is one thing if you don't care and are willing to go through the motions, but you should NOT feel like you have to do this. Explain to him that it would be meaningless to you, and that by pretending you aren't making it as important as it should be. Maybe that will make him understand.<br>  <br>  Realize that this may not work out. If he will not buudge and this is important to you, you may need to seriously reconsider the relationship. Many couples manage to work it out, but for others it is just too much and it may be better to prevent a marriage full of arguing. That doesn't make you bad people and it doesn't mean you don't love each other, it takes a lot of different things to make a relationship work and it is understandable if you can't find the balance. GIve it some time though, make sur you both have had time to calmly consider all the options.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  ADD: I think they may make you take classes or convert. It will probably depend on the church but from my understanding Catholics in general are very strict about their wedding ceremonies. You must have it in the church, you can't change the vows, etc.<br>  <br>  You can look around and see if there is a liberal priest int he area, but don't just sweep this under the rug. You both need to be sure you completely respect each others beleifs. If he just assumes that getting baptized is not going to be an issue, it is a red flag.|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	NO! You should have an outdoor wedding.You can't vow to a God you don't believe in.Besides, if you get baptized.You will also be vowing your soul/life forever to a church/God you don't believe in.I'd suggest an outdoor wedding w/ vows to "each other", good idea! Then, a reception w/ maybe his priest pronouncing a blessing before the reception begins .His priest could perform the ceremony in the park, I think.I'm not 100% on that as I'm not catholic either.Maybe have the non-denominational wedding, it's traditionally brides choice after all.Then have the priest preside over the reception in some way.Blessings,prayers,etc.Have the wedding @ the non-denominational church.Then have the reception @ the Catholic church.IDK! Those are all possibilities,though.All I know is, you must keep making suggestions.The right answer is out there.God Bless!|`|VR7JfxM4aa	Not to be a big old downer, but are you sure you have thought this thing through.

Like the Celts had Triple goddesses of motherhood, war and death. Sometimes it even seems they are Three goddesses yet all one goddess. This also happens in the middle east as well, with Babylonian and Sumerian concepts.  You had Ishtar, Nanai, and other epithets that all seem to be different and the same goddess at the same time. Ishtar with her various aspects were definately a triune nature: Love/Sexual goddess / War goddess / Planet Venus<br>  <br>  Then you can go through Egyptian lore and see the startling trinity of Father Osiris, Mother Isis, and divine Son Horus. This cult was widespread in Roman territories during the early Christian times.|`|OvuMI50Maa	the problem is that people dont know where trinity originated from. or when. <br>  The Church of the First Three Centuries says: "The doctrine of the Trinity was of gradual and comparatively late formation; . . . it had its origin in a source entirely foreign from that of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures; . . . it grew up, and was ingrafted on Christianity, through the hands of the Platonizing Fathers." <br>  <br>  By the end of the third century C.E., "Christianity" and the new Platonic philosophies became inseparably united. As Adolf Harnack states in Outlines of the History of Dogma, church doctrine became "firmly rooted in the soil of Hellenism [pagan Greek thought]. Thereby it became a mystery to the great majority of Christians." <br>  <br>  The church claimed that its new doctrines were based on the Bible. But Harnack says: "In reality it legitimized in its midst the Hellenic speculation, the superstitious views and customs of pagan mystery-worship." <br>  A PROTESTANT publication states: "The word Trinity is not found in the Bible . . . It did not find a place formally in the theology of the church till the 4th century." (The Illustrated Bible Dictionary) And a Catholic authority says that the Trinity "is not . . . directly and immediately [the] word of God."—New Catholic Encyclopedia.|`|5WIZowKOaa	The Trinity does not come from the Bible nor does it support what the Bible teaches.God is the Father, Jesus was His first creation, His son and the holy Spirit is Gods active force/power.

Watchtower 1993 Sept. 15 p.22 <br>  <br>  "And while now the witness yet includes the invitation to come to Jehovah’s organization for salvation, the time no doubt will come when the message takes on a harder tone, like a “great war cry.” " Watchtower 1981 Nov. 15 p.21 <br>  <br>  "But Jehovah God has also provided his visible organization, his “faithful and discreet slave,” made up of spirit-anointed ones, to help Christians in all nations to understand and apply properly the Bible in their lives. Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do." Watchtower 1981 Nov. 15 p.27 <br>  <br>  <br>  "Directing Bible Students to Jehovah’s Organization ***They must appreciate that identifying themselves with Jehovah’s organization is essential to their salvation." Kingdom Ministry 1990 Nov. p.1 <br>  <br>  "Direct Interest Progressively on Bible Studies: The primary purpose of a Bible study is to teach the truth of God’s Word. It should also build in the student an appreciation for Jehovah’s organization and make him aware of the vital need to become part of it. ... The weekly Bible study should include instruction that will help students appreciate the organization and take advantage of provisions for their salvation. Take a few minutes each week to relate or describe something about the organization and how it functions. You can find helpful talking points in the November 1, 1984, Watchtower. The brochures Jehovah’s Witnesses in the Twentieth Century and Jehovah’s Witnesses—Unitedly Doing God’s Will Worldwide discuss major facets of the organization and how they may benefit us. Arranging for Bible students to view the video Jehovah’s Witnesses—The Organization Behind the Name will let them see for themselves what it is accomplishing." Kingdom Ministry April 1993 p.3 <br>  To be considered part of that Organization requires reporting as an active publisher for the Watchtower Society. <br>  "As this spiritual warfare advanced, those serving with Jehovah's organization were refreshed by continuing flashes of Bible understanding, and their numbers grew until, in 1938, as many as 50,769 reported Kingdom service during an international testimony period." Watchtower 1984 Jan. 1 p.11 <br>  <br>  <br>  the biggest thing I found was that the founders used to promote the worship of Christ untill the 1950's<br>  Russell promoted the worship of Jesus and prayer to him because he is our God. <br>  "It seems clear that His Divinity was retained in humanity because He repeatedly spoke of Himself as having come down from heaven, and because He, though passing through trial and sorrow as a man, was yet possessed of the authority and exercised the prerogatives of a God. He was the object of unreproved worship even when a babe, by the wise men who came to see the new-born King. Matt. 2:2-11. Even the angels delighted to do Him honor. "When He bringeth the first-begotten into the world, He saith, "And let all the angels of God worship Him." Heb. 1:6. He never reproved any one for acts of worship offered to Himself, but when Cornelius offered such service to Peter--the leading apostle-- "he took him up, saying, stand up; I myself also am a man." .... Had Christ not been more than a man the same reason would have prevented from receiving worship...." Zion's Watch Tower 1892 May 15 p.157 <br>  <br>  "It is undoubtedly proper enough for us to address petitions to our Redeemer and Advocate, who loved us and gave himself for us....Although we are nowhere instructed to make petitions to him, it evidently could not be improper so to do; for such a course is nowhere prohibited, and the disciples worshiped him." Zion's Watch Tower 1880 Oct. p.3 <br>  <br>  "Question. The fact that our Lord received worship is claimed by some to be an evidence that while on earth he was God the Father disguised in a body of flesh and not really a man. Was he really worshiped, or is the translation faulty? Answer. Yes, we believe our Lord Jesus while on earth was really worshiped, and properly so. … It was proper for our Lord to receive worship in view of his having been the only begotten of the Father and his agent in the creation of all things, including man." Zion's Watch Tower 1898 July 15 p.216 <br>  <br>  "In one respect many of Christendom could learn numerous important lessons from these wise Gentiles....They worshiped him in three senses of the word: (1) They fell before him, prostrated themselves, thus physically expressing their reverence.

This snippet you have is proof that they do not want the holy spirit to "finish your teaching". They want themselves to have the glory of getting you to serve God. <br>  <br>  This is a false teaching and is called the "covering doctrine". This is the teaching of "Nicholaus" that was spoken of in Revelation chap 2. A lot of Churches use this in many different forms but the Witnesses flaunt this through out all of their publications. You can't go 3 paragraphs without a reference back to the advantages of being a Jehovah's Witness and how it will protect you through the last days.<br>  <br>  The scriptures are directly talking about Jesus not his organization. Where did the world get this idea that directly talking to Jesus was taboo. Jesus is the only mediator between man and God. Anything more than that is from the Devil. I think this watchtower statement proves that this group is not looking to teach you about the benefits of holy spirit and prayer but blind obedience and misdirection.<br>  <br>  In addition "anti-Christ" means "in place of Christ". Jesus said to "come to him" which is not burdensome. When we place ourselves, a spiritual leader, or a spiritual group before Christ, we are burdening ourselves which is exactly what Jesus didn't want us to do.

Well anyway here's a little something to think about.<br>  <br>  (Ephesians 4:4-6) . . .One body there is, and one spirit, even as YOU were called in the one hope to which YOU were called; 5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism; 6 one God and Father of all [persons], who is over all and through all and in all.<br>  <br>  When Paul penned this and he said that there was ONE FAITH, he understood that the organization behind Christianity had the need to be united. If it did not then people would be following a faith that was based on whoever was leading among them. <br>  <br>  Have a think about it for a while. What group of Christians in the world are totally united in whatever country you go to in the world, all taught the same way, all looking at the same material at the same time, all in agreement not challenging God's direction, all well trained the same way from the Bible, and also those taking the lead are not prominent or hold themselves in high esteem. The preaching work that you are against, is partaken in by all. That means even the leaders in the congregation are doing these tasks, it's not just left for the ones below them. We are all fellow workers of God. Just talking about that, do you really think that we are brainwashed to partake in this work. It's only that when you actually understand God's word, it's a requirement of true Christians to do this. Nothing has been contrived out of any one man, it is all directed from the Bible and can be proved. Now take notice of these scriptures:<br>  <br>  (1 Corinthians 1:10-17) . . .Now I exhort YOU, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that YOU should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among YOU, but that YOU may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought. 11 For the disclosure was made to me about YOU, my brothers, by those of [the house of] Chlo′e, that dissensions exist among YOU. 12 What I mean is this, that each one of YOU says: “I belong to Paul,” “But I to A·pol′los,” “But I to Ce′phas,” “But I to Christ.” 13 The Christ exists divided. Paul was not impaled for YOU, was he? Or were YOU baptized in the name of Paul? 14 I am thankful I baptized none of YOU except Cris′pus and Ga′ius, 15 so that no one may say that YOU were baptized in my name. 16 Yes, I also baptized the household of Steph′a·nas. As for the rest, I do not know whether I baptized anybody else. 17 For Christ dispatched me, not to go baptizing, but to go declaring the good news, not with wisdom of speech, that the torture stake of the Christ should not be made useless..<br>  <br>  Highlighting from these scriptures:<br>  <br>  * through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that YOU should all speak in agreement, and that there should not be divisions among YOU, but that YOU may be fitly united in the same mind and in the same line of thought.<br>  <br>  This along with everything else, is this not what we see from the organization of Jehovah's Witnesses. Contrast that with other faiths in the world, what do you think of your faith?<br>  <br>  Is it not true that although there are other faiths out there and they go individually by name, they have the same doctrines and beliefs (the trinity, all go to heaven etc.). Now when there is some sort of religious event they all come together and are united for that cause. But all taught a different way and going under different names. Yet who are the ones who remain separate from this and stick to their organization united. There is no room for disunity in God's organization!<br>  <br>  Now back to the scripture of your question:<br>  <br>  (John 6:66-69) . . .Owing to this many of his disciples went off to the things behind and would no longer walk with him. 67 Therefore Jesus said to the twelve: “YOU do not want to go also, do YOU?” 68 Simon Peter answered him: “Lord, whom shall we go away to? You have sayings of everlasting life; 69 and we have believed and come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”<br>  <br>  .........................................<br>  <br>  Like the disciples of old, we consider that there is no other organization to go away to. Having said that it is obvious that we believe this is God's organization and true Christianity, but we are not doing this blindly, in fact you could ask any one of us and we could prove it from the Bible.<br>  <br>  Just to clarify, when I say organization and disciples of old, I'm talking about the organization of True Christianity. Today we call ourselves Jehovah's Witnesses with the emphasis going to the Devine name Jehovah. Jesus Christ is still our role model and leader also acting as mediator to the Almighty for us. But ultimately as did Jesus, he did all things for his Father and Almighty God Jehovah devoting himself to his requirements.<br>  <br>  When Christianity was in its infancy it had Christ in it presence. All the same it was organized. Now Christ is not present in Earthly form, it has been very easy for many different groups to go and call themselves Christian. So that leads to the question; who really are Christians and what group is doing all the organization?<br>  <br>  Yes Peter in John 6:66-69 was talking about Jesus Christ himself and today we recognise who else can we go away to, but if we take that a little further we can go a bit deeper and realise that we need an organization just as it was organized back then, then we discern to have contact with Jesus we need an organization. There are scriptures that instruct us to meet together, hence be organized. So whom else can we go away to as Peter said; only Christ has sayings of everlasting life. But whom is he using on the Earth today who are truly representative of Christianity. If we find True Christianity who else can we go away to.|`|AA10554783	God mentions nothing about JW's being his organization, Grace only comes from Jesus christ.|`|CmHLKKODaa	Just another instance of the Watchtower putting itself in the way of Salvation !<br>  <br>  Jesus is the only way unless you are a Jehovah's witness ????<br>  <br>  You would think more people would question the Watchtower !|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	This speaks to my mind like a cult-scare-tactic designed to keep members locked in their organization.  It is a twisting of Peter's words recorded in John 6:68-69, "Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69We believe and know that you are the Holy One of God."<br>  <br>  The operative words here are, "TO WHOM shall we go"; not "NOWHERE ELSE TO GO."|`|AA11232725	I think that it's just more twisting of the Scriptures from a religion that is empowered by the spirit of the anti-Christ. Any religion that demotes the Lord Jesus to the position of a powerful angel or a prophet of God is preaching a "substitute" or anti-Christ.<br>  <br>  John 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  2  He was in the beginning with God.  3  All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made....14  And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br>  <br>  1 John 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.  2  By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,  3  and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	Those are not the words of my God and yes JW's are taught that if they leave the Org. they are doomed.|`|VJnuDRR9aa	They can be taught that serving God's organization on earth is the way to eternal life.<br>  If they want to  believe it that is up to them.<br>  <br>  I go to the one who stated "I am the way the truth and the Life I prefer to stake my claims to life in the blood of the Lamb.Jesus Christ  as the ONLY way  to gain eternal life and with the season of the Memorial of Christs death soon approaching  I would like to give a small reminder of what he said This is not a rant it is a scriptural quote.Please read it all for your edification<br>  <br>  It is found in John chapter 6 starting in verse 50 and it is Jesus speaking. Thats John 6:50<br>  <br>  This is the bread that came down from heaven: that a man may eat thereof  and not die 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven :if any man (note : any man) eat this bread he shall live forever:and the bread that I will give is my flesh,which I will give for the life of the world.(  note: not a select few BUT the entire world)53 Then Jesus said to them ,Truly I say to you unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood ,you have no life in you.(remember these words as the emblems pass you by on memorial night )54) Whoso eats my flesh  and drinks my blood ,HATH ETERNAL LIFE  and I  will raise him up at the last day 55) for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is drink indeed.57)  He that eats my flesh and drinks my blood ,dwells in me and I in him. For an even completer understanding read the entire chapter and remember that THIS is what Jeasus taught . Note caps added for emphises and statements in parenthises are for teaching only not scripture)<br>  <br>  Where a person goes to worship God and gain eternal life is not to an organization of any sort they must go to Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  His disiples acknowledged that when he asked if they were going to leave him also they said "Where shall we go ? You have the sayings of eternal life." And as the above testifies he certainly does and His words are alive and sharper then a two edged sword. <br>  <br>  These are Jesus words NOT an organizations words and the credit and glory for such should go to Him and non other.  <br>  <br>  Who has told you and taught you to ignore these words of Jesus Christ and to do what they teach instead of what he teaches ? Who has made the word of God(scripture) invalid?  There is no where else to go but but to the Lord Jesus Not the Watchtower .The bible does not say that ,That is a twisted interpertation . John 6:66-69 <br>  <br>  <br>  Who has made themselves Lord to you that they apply the words in John6 :66-69 to themselves <br>  <br>  Whois talking there ? who has the sayings of everlasting life the FDS or Jesus Christ .Certainly they aren't ONE and the same are they .<br>  <br>  Wake up ! That is blasphemy.
fgxajTiBaa	Absolutely not. Because looks change quite a bit as we get older. Personalities tend to grow with your partner.|`|jIk2ttH1aa	Pffft.  - NO.<br>  <br>  I was modeling at the time, met a total dichead and thought I loved him, got pregnant (btw that was best thing that ever happened to me).  <br>  <br>  But pregnancy is hard and ones priorities change quick and drastically...it's all about the life you are carrying...<br>  <br>  Needless to say I  was 8 1/2 months pregnant, going to a 50th birthday party with my boyfriend at the time.  I was being a good sport about going, even though I was exhausted.  I started to get dressed and he told me to "make sure I looked Hot", cause all his friends were going to be there, and kissed me on my cheek.  I almost puked on him.<br>  <br>  I looked down at my huge belly and realized how f'in superficial this jerk was and how even carrying his child, he still didn't see ME...the truest most important parts of me....  It was really deflating.<br>  <br>  Would you ever want that to be you?|`|VeXDGn62aa	No. Looks fade, and in 40 years I doubt I'll look remotely like I do now. (Not that I'll probably be with that person until then, but I'm just trying to make my point)|`|7aK81hsbaa	depends how close it is. i value personality far more.|`|gXIA9yHJaa	If you're with someone who believes that your looks are the most important thing about you, the relationship will never survive. There are many facets to you as an individual that make you special and looks are the least of all. If this question is literal and you're really in this situation, stand back and think about this person and the time you spend together. After evaluating the situation, make your decision based on what you're most interested in - a physical relationship (which is almost always short term) or a permanent relationship, which encompasses all facets of your partner and yourself as a unit. I want to clearly explain what I mean by facets:  interests, desires, ideologies, principles, communication skills, religion, and lastly appearance.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you in your decision process.|`|qXH5WiWjaa	No<br>  <br>  If that's the case you have no real foundation and the relationship will fail eventually anyway|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	No, but if that was the case then they must be blind. I'm far from being any GQ model.|`|Wmxpi9Amaa	No. What would happen if I was mauled by a bear? That's not a very good way to love.|`|szwFTvNaaa	No.|`|grYkoDaraa	i don't think so.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	That's sounds like the last one i dated. I've learned my lesson, so no.|`|gWJqarq8aa	no,if someone loves me they have 2 love me whole not only my outside!|`|0mwpAxfRaa	Thats kind of the norm for me, hahaha all the girls say I have a 'beautiful personality' but my body is even more gorgeous. Hahahha. So to answer the question. Yes.|`|SLAEzvnMaa	Absolutely not. A persons value truly comes from the qualities they offer from with in. Not just the package they are wrapped in. Beauty is nothing without substance to go with it.|`|QlCopFqyaa	No but if she likes me and just finds me cute then I don't mind.  As long as the two go hand in hand.|`|uky2nsh8aa	NO, never. taht's disgusting.

HenWgGkFaa	Maybe he's homeless. At any rate, he's certainly mentally ill. It's not best to laugh at people who have severe mental issues. Just try not to hit him with the car.|`|HypqcnJaaa	I think he was probably homeless and people were just being b*tches.|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	There can be 101 different reasons why someone would run down the middle of the road.  One trying to get through heavy traffic because they were late and the car broke down comes to mind.  However, it is more than likely that something was wrong with him from drugs to a reaction to a medication.  Calling the police and voicing concern for the man would have been in order.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	Sounds like he was on drugs. I would have called police he could have been killed.|`|M1u6fdZCaa	I probably wouldn't have called the police b/c I know someone else would have.|`|AA10216571	Druggie. I would have called the police|`|kMoC5dJ1aa	lol METH! :) by the time the cops showed up he would be gone so there really is nothing you could have done. :) no worries
M1u6fdZCaa	Did you cheat on her previously?  You probably did.|`|P544Sbmqaa	My experience is that you have given them a reason to be nosy.  You either arent being honest about something and she knows it, or things arent well in the marriage, or you have a history of lieing or infidelity.  Even though I doubt it, if none of those things apply, then she probably has been lied to a lot in the past or may have low self esteem.|`|h9XfQDxNaa	maybe she likes you so much that she'd feel jealous of others|`|qXH5WiWjaa	So I read someones answer who said that maybe you gave reason for her to not trust you and thereby that is why she looked thru your phone.  However it's not always something that you may have done.  It may have been the person in her previous relationship and now she has trust issues with anyone.  It's really hard to say why women do that but I feel you man.  The day my ex girlfriend started going thru my phone (and I never gave her a reason to) was the day I started to distrust her myself.  I took my phone everywhere and refused to let her touch it.  I do recommend sitting down and talking to her about the situation if you are thinking of trying to work things out.  Good luck|`|oZhFwwBoaa	She thinks you're cheating. She doesn't trust you. Why wouldn't she trust you? Marriage needs trust. Perhaps separation was the right thing to do; if you can't trust each other, you two are not meant to be.<br>  <br>  Since she doesn't trust you, that's an indication that you've cheated before, though it may have not been on her (a past girlfriend perhaps)...<br>  <br>  Are you able to be trusted? Do you lie a lot?<br>  <br>  This is why.|`|yOHCXiaMaa	God, save us from our own insecurities. <br>  <br>  Marriage is suppose to be sharing, believing in each other and supporting each other.  If one or more of the spouses are bitten by the green-eyed monster it can be a brutal battle from day one.  It can also destroy feelings and the belief you are dealing with an intelligent life form.<br>  <br>  Until she learns to "live" in her space and not violate yours.... it is going to be a forever battle.  Slowly and surely you will lose respect, faith and loyalty to her.  More than likely till she runs into someone who puts her through these very same paces she will never learn how detrimental she was to the demise of your marriage.<br>  <br>  Also if you have an individual who is always blaming others for her "faults" and "actions".  You may never see daylight till you throw your hands up in frustration and walk away.<br>  <br>  And before either of you fling mud... maybe each of you need to look at yourself. Have you changed your habits lately.  Like dressing provocatively to go to school or work?  Or maybe having numbers on your own phone and lying as to who and what they are?  Demanding an individual do a three way but refusing to do one when the catch you in your own lies.Or telling someone you are going to bed when in actually you are out at the club?  People who live in glass houses should never throw stones.. it tends to fall down around your own head|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	I've never done that or had that done to me!<br>  <br>  Maybe you gave her a reason to do it. Have you cheated on her before?  Something had to have happened to make her so insecure.|`|z0ukxexyaa	As a matter of fact all of u are completely correcto!! If he is going to put me on blast like that, Might as well say the whole truth. Since our break up is this serious to be put on net, at least say why I am use to being nosy! Yes, infidelity occurred, numerous times!! After reaching an agreement on the last infidelity that you were going to stop contact with this women if she can be called that! You continued to speak to her three more times you were caught! Yes I was nosy, but you left me no choice after feeling you were up to something. I besides your mom know you more than any other woman you have come across, I know when you change towards me , like being disrespectful or rude something is up! But this is the excuse you decided to use, me being nosy as a way to turn things around to me an put the blame on me. But its all good becuase it makes you feel better towards the guilt you have in your mind. You gave up on me so easy, while I put up with so many AND YOU KNOW IT!! N then still had the nerve to help you out today n you know how. So before you ask a question look into the past and tell me that I had no reason to inform myself about my own husband.

If a  friend asked me to get something for them, I would, because on another occasion, she would get something for me . However, if a person is rude or derogatory or just being mean, I would just stay out of their way...certainly wouldn't get it for a rude person,|`|O4jGlC2caa	No one is obligated to buy anyone else a drink.  This goes for guys buying girls drinks at a bar too.|`|STumBiU0aa	actually its rude to ask anyone to go and buy you a drink!|`|k3LbhASGaa	depends if she is gonna give out|`|8aa2ea728deb10155c8014220bf22a62aa	Just ask this ugly woman what she thinks about the issue.

CNSGz12zaa	A pretty name! I love Lolita Flores the singer|`|VqAgZB0uaa	its completely good. love the name! dont worry about the name versus your culture. i know plenty of people whose names are from their culture and vice wersa and they are always lovely.|`|AA10254694	Professor Humbert Humbert<br>  Vladimir Nabokov 1955|`|njrKjJVwaa	Lolita  is a female given name of Spanish origin. It is the diminutive form of Lola, itself a diminutive form of Dolores (Spanish: suffering).<br>  <br>  The name was made famous by Vladimir Nabokov's 1955 novel Lolita. Due to its associations with the novel's title character, the name has acquired the meaning of a sexually precocious girl. A UK retail chain was criticised in January 2008 for branding as "Lolita" a bed aimed at young girls.|`|0R46pYb3aa	Whatever name you choose, give her a name that will command respect when she is an adult.|`|NpJk2Heraa	No! I like that name! I used to know a girl named Kilola and she was never made fun of. You can name her Ruby too.|`|m1JxtSVSaa	i think it's a cute name..|`|Tn1bMQ3Aaa	I automatically think of the movie Lolita.. I'm from the states.<br>  The older American generation have heard of or seen the movie..<br>  <br>  It's possible that by the time your child is older the connection may be gone..Which is clear by the responses you have received, as it seems they are clueless about book you mentioned..<br>  <br>  That book and movie really damaged that name.!|`|57bc2e76c4c22f51ec6b0569135c682eaa	I would go with Lalita since it is traditional and avoids the connotations.   What's cute and undestandable at 6 is much harder to bear at 16.|`|16c39d1b9860f98ac0623eeeeb7348c7aa	Its a cute name, but I would definitely be worried about her time in grade school and the comments/possible harassment from other children.|`|Kdr9CRbqaa	umm, it's a pretty name, but lola is better, umm is kinda wierd, b/c my dog's name is lola.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I do not like it, it sort of sounds like a prostitute....|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	Yeah, the connotations are not good and unavoidable.

But I can't represent the rest of the western world.<br>  <br>  Lolita has connotations along the lines of an underage girl who has relationships with older men.<br>  <br>  Though I personally love that word, as well as the fashion, not everyone will. So I would recommend another name.|`|AA10128139	Well...

But at least she won't be confused with any other kids in her class, that's a pain. But if you love the name, then that's fine. I know a Janecka, and a Nodja. But I think it's a kind of pretty name. Exotic. It'll grow on her. And if worse comes to worse she can change her name :P<br>  At least it's not harry or richard (dick). Good, thing it's a girl. It's up to you in the end. I thought I loved the name Nuala. but it was a bit on the deep end. But I think Lalita is good, it sounds spanish to me actually. At least you won't name her Apple.|`|CwdcbFr0aa	I think Lolita is a nice name, i think it sounds Indian or Spanish. I's not wrong by any means to name your daughter that, you may just want to think about what she'll think about the name as she gets older.

JdYVmsNaaa	And speaking of bothersome questions, why should an eternal consciousness be designed so as to be unaware, or only subconsciously aware, of its prior existence? <br>  <br>  As imagined eternities go, I'd opt for a new physical life over perpetual disembodied prayer-reception in the clouds. But why should my consciousness/soul/what-have-you be recycled with memory loss? What's the advantage? And if there is no advantage, then why doesn't consciousness adhere to evolutionary principles? What DOES it adhere to? <br>  <br>  That's the problem: we have to spin stories on top of stories to sustain these beliefs, or else plead out with "it is beyond us".<br>  <br>   In the end, the only thing I know for certain is that religion feels to me like self-indulgence.

Thanks for asking.|`|0b1bc0d20db45e766b5bd783ee1b2812aa	I suppose "physically-liberated" means that we are going to have to find some other alternative to the varying strength of  hippocamal synaptic pathway constellations.........oh well...<br>  <br>  We could start with judged for what? [to determine if we are saved]...saved from what?.....by who? of course if we know the who, we would probably know the how and what....but lets move on....<br>  <br>  we could start with the mind/ brain dilemma or the phenomenology of consciousness.... there is a "ghost" in the machine.....<br>  <br>  we might have a better chance viewing ourselves as holographic software... <br>  <br>  maybe the change is more aparent than real. Perhaps we go from existence to nonexistence the same way we go from space to time and matter to energy.<br>  <br>  or perhaps our existence is measured by its impact on the universe that  leaving a momentary  bit of VOID in the Nothingness of existence that can be measured they way you would measure the parameters of an object suddenly removed from a room filled with smoke- the way the ground changes when you remove the figure from the figure/ground.<br>  <br>  then again, our "humanessence" could be encoded on a spatial brane. According to SS-M theory, branes are everywhere there is matter and thus, they are present in the matter of brains. An automatic encoding process may already exist! Secondly, at death, the humanessence is simply transferred from one brane to another, analogous to transferring information from one photographic plate to another (one suitable for the new afterlife environment). The final step is analogous to projection through the holographic photo plate.<br>  <br>  then again maybe it is just a case of wishful societal thinking to suggest that judgement doesn't begin until after we cease to be. Perhaps it is our way to rationalize our lack of focus on those things for which we should probably be judged immediately. There is such a thing as taking responsibility for our actions just in case we are a bit mistaken about the Pearly Gate Process.  :-)|`|AA10246871	My feeling is it must reside in the spirit, or soul, if you prefer.<br>  <br>  I have read a lot about past life regression under hypnosis, and all of it points to something coming forward into new lives. Since it obviously cannot be the physical parts of the body, it must reside in some other entity, and since I believe in the existence of the soul, that leads me to believe that is where it resides.<br>  <br>  I used to work with a therapist who used hypnosis to get at those tricky parts of our minds which would prefer to forget something. She had a startling case where a woman who was having problems opened up under hypnotic regression and revealed a death by hypothermia. She also revealed details which led my therapist to be able to locate the actual case. My therapist kept the tapes from the sessions, and also had articles about the original death by hypothermia and drowning (a fall through the ice in late winter/early spring), as well as the obituary. All of the information which led to the newpaper articles came from the hypnotic regressions. <br>  <br>  There are numerous cases recorded in medical journals of children being able to speak fluently in languages to which they have had no exposure--often before they can speak their own "native" language. The one which sticks in my mind was a Mongolian child who began speaking fluent French at about the age of 11 months, long before she could string together more than a few words in Mongolian. The parents thought it was babble until a local doctor recognized it as a foreign language and found someone who could tell them what it was. Interestingly, as her skills grew in her native language, she lost the French. You can find references to this type of thing in well-researched articles in medical journals.<br>  <br>  There's also a bit to be said for a type of cellular memory. I have most often seen it referred to with reference to the heart. I read a book about a middle-aged woman whose congenital heart defect made it necessary for her to have a transplant. After the surgery, she found herself with desires, dreams, habits and preferences which were completely foreign to her. It wasn't until she sought and was given permission to communicate with the donor's family that she found her answer. In particular, the dreams she was having were of things which had happened to him--a 17 year old boy. She is convinced she got more than mere tissue during that surgery.<br>  <br>  It says in The Bible that there is a book in which all is recorded, and which will lie open, revealing everything. If one believes in the existence of a soul, then it's not much of a reach to believe that some helpful entity will allow an individual to have a peek at his or her own pages if their memory should falter when they are called upon to answer for their deeds.<br>  <br>  Realistically, if this is all there is, and nothing happens when we die, then it's a moot point. If, however, as I believe, the soul continues on, then we will, eventually, become privy to the workings of such mysteries.<br>  <br>  One last thing. I have always loved the way the Ancient Egyptians looked at how we are judged. All of a person's actions and thoughts were said to be recorded in the heart. After death, the heart was weighed on a scale against a feather. That was the ultimate test of how we live our lives. I have a beautiful image of it in one of my books, but my scanner has gone to the great gig in the sky, so this will have to do:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/anubis_judgment.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.uncp.edu/home/rwb/anubis_judg...</a><br>  <br>  Salaam, friend.|`|xACwWEXHaa	As a child I was taught that after death one is reunited with God.  I took that to mean a physical reunion, a sort of return to the source like a stream returning to the sea. <br>  <br>   If, after death,  I am part of an omniscient power, my memories would be part of that omniscience.  Thus I would know on what basis I was being judged, and I'd know the basis for judgment for every other person, as well.  "The veil would be pulled back, and we would know" is how my pastor phrased it at my Grandmother's funeral.<br>  <br>  I figured that mechanism made as much sense as any other.|`|SGiVFN9taa	A good question!<br>  <br>  <br>  We have our subconscious mind<br>  where everything is 'recorded'<br>  from the time of our birth.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for our Spirits retaining our memories...<br>  who can explain that a blob of fat (our brain)<br>  can keep billions of "bytes" of memory<br>  from the time we were born?<br>  <br>  <br>  This is the reason that hypnotism<br>  is a very dangerous undertaking, since<br>  under hypnosis, every dastardly act<br>  is "replayed". Vividly! And many,<br>  unable to handle their guilt,<br>  will commit suicide.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible speaks of a "Book of Records"<br>  (I cannot recall where) where everything<br>  is "on record", which will--- on Judgment Day<br>  --- be opened for our so-called trial, where we will be <br>  Judged for everything good and evil we have done on Earth.<br>  <br>  <br>  On Earth, governments keep records of near everything<br>  of their citizens: birth, school, employment, police, death, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for that mechanism you speak of...<br>  who would really know?

Somewhere<br>  in that ninety (90) percent is the answer.|`|BLWxEdrMaa	Our memory is partly chemical (proven through experiments with worms and later follow-up studies of human chemical makeup), partly brain tissue, and partly heart tissue, with the possibility that other organs have similar capabilities.  I honestly do not think that there is an immortal soul.  I believe that when the bodily functions cease, so does the personality (largely inherited, DNA-based but also partly the result of our environment and training).<br>  <br>  I have no reason whatsoever to imagine that there are any actual evidences in existance of any such thing.  I know since the most ancient times people have believed in an immortal soul, and in reincarnation, and I don't claim to know everything - but I just don't see any evidence that such a thing is true.|`|7zbj4jU1aa	That's a really good question.

Thing is who of us really knows for sure what will happen when God comes.|`|AA11562077	Oh boy, HERE come some TD's!<br>  <br>  Most interesting aspect of this to me is the evidence proposed by the Scientologists.<br>  <br>  Originally founded as "Dianetics" in about 1950, L. Ron Hubbard's therapy consisted of regressing 'patients' in semi-conscious "reverie", with simple measurement of changes in pulse and breathing, attentiveness and so on used by the 'auditor' to indicate subconscious stress.  The detailed and repetitive recounting of these 'traumatic' events produced stable improvement in subjects, who were then able to access earlier events in their lifetime.  All subjects then went further back into their past, and eventually encountered birth trauma, which was similarly confronted, relived and resolved.<br>  <br>  At this point, an astonishing phenomenon occurred.  ALL subjects, once birth trauma was successfully confronted, then began recounting past life experiences, including deaths.  Hubbard accepted this data as actual experience, repeated as it was without exception.  Thus the founding of "Scientology", which actually deals with ONLY past lives.  Needless to say, Hubbard's new theories were greeted with universal skepticism, to say the least. This is, however, the essential difference between Dianetics and Scientology -- a fact unknown to most people unacquainted with the practices of the Church of Scientology first-hand.<br>  <br>  I've never done any Scientology auditing myself, and so can offer no opinion about its validity one way or another.  But some of the claimed discoveries do offer unique and even plausible explanations of some phenomena which are part of other, inductive religious philosophies; Buddhism's 'Wall of Fire', or Hindu reincarnation for instance.<br>  <br>  In other words, a Scientologist will say that we KNOW what we "are being judged for" -- we are just not AWARE of the reasons.  This is their basic premise behind addressing what we call 'immorality', 'addiction', or 'mental illness', and they suggest that resolving this dilemma is a great part of our reason to be born as human beings; this time around anyway!
423b37222c9aecc6d4e09218cb231a06aa	I just want to share this...<br>  <br>  Three years after the advent of Islam, Allah commanded the Prophet to proclaim his invitation to Islam to his immediate family in Makkah by commanding, “And warn your tribe who are of near kindred.”[Noble Quran, 26:214] <br>  <br>  The Prophet gathered forty members of his tribe, Bani Hashim and held a feast inside the house of his uncle Abu Talib by preparing food for them. After they had finished eating, the Prophet said to them, “O children of 'Abd al-Mutallib! By Allah, I don't know any young person from among the Arabs who has brought his people something better than that which I am bringing you. I have brought you the best of this world and the next, and Allah has commanded me to invite you to it. So who will be my supporter in this endeavor, to be my brother, my successor (khalifah), and legatee?” No one stood up to accept this invitation except Ali ibn Abi Talib, who was only about 13 years old at the time, said, “I will be your supporter in this endeavor.” The Prophet requested him to sit down and then repeated his question a second time. Again, only Ali stood up, and again the Prophet asked him to sit. When even the third time the Prophet heard no answer from the other family members, Ali stood up again and repeated his support. The Prophet then put his hand on his leg and said to the forty men from his immediate family, “This is my brother, my legatee, and my successor (khalifah) over you, so listen to him and obey him.” The men stood and while laughing told the father of Ali, “Your nephew has ordered you to listen to your son and obey him.”[1]<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  REFERENCES:<br>  <br>  [1] Ihqaq al-Haqq, Vol. 4, 62; Tarikh al-Tabari, Vol. 2, 117; Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Vol. 1, 159; Tarikh Abul Fida, Vol. 1, 116; Nadhm Durar al-Simtayn, 82; Kifayat al-Talib, 205; Tarikh Madinat Dimishq, Vol.1, Hadith 87, 139 and 143; al-Hasakani, Shawahid al-Tanzil, Vol. 1, 420; Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Jami‘ al-Bayan, Vol. 19, 131; Jalal al-Din al-Suyuti, al-Durr al-Manthur, Vol. 5, 97; Tafsir ibn Kathir, Vol. 3, 350; al-Baghdadi, Tafsir al-Khazin, Vol. 3, 371; al-Alusi al-Baghdadi, Ruh al-Ma?ani, Vol. 19, 122; al-Tantawi, Tafsir al-Jawahir, Vol. 13, 103; al-Hakim al-Naysaburi, al-Mustadrak ‘ala al-Sahihayn, Vol. 3, 135.

EJHhCDcaaa	Their teaching is that Jesus returned in 1914 to begin his Second Coming or “invisible presence” in fulfillment of Matthew 24:3. Then in 1918 he began to make an examination of all the religions claiming to represent him to see if any of them had been faithfully and discreetly providing true teachings of the Bible (spiritual food) at the proper time during his absence. They say that the only religion he found doing so was the Watchtower Society and therefore Jesus<br>  appointed them over all his earthly interests or “belongings” in the spring of 1919.<br>  <br>  To make such a statement would be an insult to Christ Jesus to say that he selected this organization on the basis of what it was teaching as of 1919.<br>  <br>  They were teaching so many thing that were different and what they say today is wrong such as the Holidays, Christmas, Easter and so on.  Worshiping Jesus, Jesus died on a cross.  The list is so long it would take up more space then I have here.  This doesn't include the bible chronology, date setting thing that they so misapplied and got soooo wrong.  They are not the Faithful and discrete slave nor are they God's chosen organization they are the organization that God lets an operation of Error  go to them that they may get to believing the lie.<br>  <br>  Because they did not accept the love of the truth …that is why God lets an operation of error go to them that they may get to believing the lie. – 2 Thessalonians 2:10,11<br>  <br>  The purpetual lie that stems from this Organization, that Jesus has come back to earth (his second coming) in 1874 then redone to say 1914.  Then this 1918 appointment thing, it all a big lie and put out for those whom are week in their faith to become inslaved in.    Truth is in God's Word not in the concept that an Organization will feed you his word and interpret it for you and screw it up and make changes and then call it new light to make you believe in thier false teachings.|`|C8gLsP3Taa	Jehovah's Witnesses never even existed before Mr russell decided to form this cult.

No.|`|x2EBjOataa	NO I dont|`|xhHxhai5aa	I don't believe in Jesus.  So, no :P|`|Api5zLaeaa	No. Jesus did not such thing. It is actually insulting to say that Jesus would have picked a religious organization that:<br>  1) Founded by a questionable leader with family ties to Freemasonry.<br>  2) Was unproven due to the initial changes in doctrine.<br>  3) Was Jesus looking at the heart of the leader at that time which was Rutherford or the organization? If it was Rutherford then he would have seen a drunk with visions of grandeur. If it was the organization he would have seen a ragtag group of people in an organization that would constantly change its doctrine for the next 100 years.<br>  4) The date of 1919 is wrong for at least 2 reasons. It is based off of the questionable date of 607bc. Also the way the date is achieved is through counting a number of years from that date to 1914 using Gregorian solar years instead of prophetic years.<br>  5) The quick growth of the group after 1919 is not a result of blessings; it is a result of a slick advertising campaign and the vaccum of unappealing religion. We can't forget that not just the Witnesses gained during this period. Mormons and Adventists also experienced large growth during this time. So JWs are not unique.|`|AA10554783	where is 1914!|`|CmHLKKODaa	No, I do not !|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Jesus hasn't been on earth for 2,000 years, and He certainly didn't appoint anyone to preach a massage that contradicts the message HE preached when He was here.|`|zyxY4dbMaa	No I think That IF Jesus were to appoint someone over his sheep, they would at least recognize who Jesus is in his divinity.|`|tManvxfQaa	Nope.....He did not|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Nope.  The reason being is that they claim that when Jesus came by for slave inspection, only THEY were engaged in PURE Worship.  They were also in the middle of worshiping Jesus, using the Cross, celebrating Christmas and Easter, attending a variety of churches, and some were even serving in the military.  <br>  <br>  These are things that the jw's strongly condemn today.  If they were doing it right in 1919, why don't they believe anything they were teaching back then anymore? If they had it right when Jesus came and accepted them, shouldn't they still be doing things "JUST SO"?

7J1D1IyRaa	Extremism exists in all cultures and religions, and some of the most brutal extremist acts have been perpetrated by atheist regimes, the classic example being Enver Hoxa's Albania which officially made <br>  atheism state policy and many people were hanged for praying. Pol Pot is another example. <br>  <br>  As in other religions, religious zealotry has existed among Muslims, yet it rarely resulted in mass violence. The only example that I can think of where extremists took up arms and succeeded is when Ibn Saud and his tribesmen took over what is now Saudi Arabia. But the House of Saud has also been friendly with the West, and the strict monotheists ("wahabis") have never wanted to invade or take over other nations or <br>  to spread Islam by force outside of their own region. Saudis do finance Islamic projects to propagate Islam but that is through peaceful means. <br>  <br>  After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the CIA working with Pakistani intelligence ISI and funded by Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, started the "Jihadi" movement in the border areas of Pakistan.  Jihadi textbooks were prepared at the University of Nebraska and distributed in the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan by the ISI. Religious extremists were used as "useful idiots" to get the <br>  Soviets out. It worked. <br>  <br>  After Soviets left, Osama bin Ladin returned to his own native  country, Saudi Arabia, and two things happened: 1). the US decided to establish permanent military bases in Saudi Arabia after the first Gulf War, and 2). Israeli brutalities against the Palestinians and the Lebanese continued unabated, with impunity. Bin Ladin realized that <br>  the Americans have no intention of ever leaving the Middle East, they have established full military control over Gulf countries, and they are hurting interests of Muslims by their actions or strategic non- actions, such as their refusal to condemn or pressure Israel. So his strategy was to use the same trick against the US as they themselves had used against the Soviets. The same team was selected.  The strategy didn't work this time for several reasons: 1). There was no super-power backing this time. 2). Afghans who had hosted the liberation movement had themselves become divided. 3). The Western Powers controlled the international media and the banking system. 4). The US forces were entrenched in too many Arab countries. 5). Unlike the Afghans, and contrary to American public opinion, the vast majority of Arabs do not normally stick their neck out unless they really have to, and they were afraid of Iraq-like chaos, and that's something that Bin Ladin also alludes to in couple of his speeches. <br>  <br>  So even though al-Qaida strategy has failed, the desire on the part of ordinary Arabs and Muslims to liberate their countries from Western hegemony has not ebbed. Hardly any Arab or Muslim believes that the US or Britain is fighting for 'their' freedom. They are the ones they need freedom from! To achieve their goal of having political and economic independence from the West, some Muslims have proposed uniting Muslims in some form or another, so that they would have the strength to stand up to Western imperialism. (Al-Qaida, by the way, never took that position). That was a mistake on the part of Arabs/ Muslims because Jewish lobbies immediately used the bogey of "global Jihad" for the establishment of a Caliphate to make a case that that is the root cause of terrorism-a demand that can never be met. The CORE political issues i.e., freedom for Palestinians and presence of US/British troops in the Middle East was then either ignored or quickly dismissed. So, for example, in the recent PBS series, <br>  "America at a Crossroads," towards one of the episodes they briefly mentioned that the US is keeping troops in 130 countries but wouldn't elaborate on it as the one of the very reasons why terrorists are attacking the US. That would have offended the Conservatives and Jews in this country; PBS chickened out. Not only that, PBS gave one full hour to Michael Isikoff to perpetuate this myth.|`|WdAuncq9aa	they just want from  america and jews to leave them alone<br>  <br>  no invations to Muslims country based on lies like iraq and Afghanistan and somalia bomb every where supporting corrupt leaders<br>  hundreds ofwedding parties been bombed killing hundreds then they say  sorry we thought is group of terrorst until now klling is on going|`|Kl56NSmLaa	One objective of terrorism is to force the government into an oppressive reaction and thus alienate its citizens.

CIA trained, armed and funded the so called "Afhgan Mujhadeen", to fight off the soviet union. The CIA built training camps across the Afghan Pak border. The "mujhadeen" later went on to become what we now know as "Alqaeda" and Taliban. Taliban went on to rule Afghanistan, bringing with them a very strict rule which as Yvonne Ridley and all scholars in the muslim world explains is totally unislamic. Eventhough there was security and low crime the laws seem quite strict to say the least. 911 provided America an excuse to invade Afghanistan. Later as an excuse to invade Iraq incase the excuse of WOMD failed to materialise as it did. So in this case the so called "islamic terrorism" has enabled America to justify their wars. It has provided new legislations allowing America air rights, allow their investigations to all transactions, etc.<br>  The vericity of the perputrators of attacks for example in the mumbai attack are controversal to say the least. <br>  Israels seige of gaza and west bank has seen militant organistations wanting to resist and fight against Israels oppression and genocide. So there objective is to free its people. Hezbollah has been formed to fight against Israels constant attacks in Lebonan. <br>  We should stop jumping into conclusion everytime CNN and FOX portray their side of the story, which will represent the views of those funding them, and condemn and protest against our govenment to change its foriegn policies and unite to condemn terrorist attacks no matter who the perputrators are, whether our own or not.<br>  The term Islamic terrorism is a paradox itself. Yet post 911 it has been quite easily embraced; showing how ignorant and hypocritical we really are.|`|eDYXQxA9aa	Yep.

(Happened in Virgina this week.<br>  <br>  Nothing is being done.|`|pDvlQQkcaa	Having to turn down a job because of being unable to transit to/from it.   <br>  <br>  Even when a job site openly says it's ADA compliant and a public transit system exists in a community, unless that same community public transit system actually covers where the job is located, you as a person with a disability cannot take the job only because you are a person with a disability whose disability requires the use of public transit.<br>  <br>  Using public transit is not an option until you've saved up enough money for a private car and/or an 'eco-concious choice'. You legally cannot drive.  <br>  <br>  Having to turn down a job which you are otherwise qualified for only because you cannot transit to/from it is very frustrating-embarassing, but it is completely permitted.  <br>  <br>  I as a responsible adult am expected to get myself to/from my job in a timely manner in order to prove that I am capable of properly performing it. <br>  <br>  Otherwise, it creates an argument for the company to hire another qualified candidate who can and does get to the site on time, including a candidate whose particular disability does not involve those transit problems (hard of hearing, asthma, diabetes..etc).<br>  <br>  I explain this and my specific experiences to my parents, family, and others who themselves have been able to easily pick and choose their jobs.<br>  <br>  They know, have known my disability prohibits me from driving.

But the hearing loss just kicks my butt especially in large crowded areas when trying to talk to store clerks, waiters etc.  Even if you say "hey I'm hard of hearing" no one gets it.  There is virtually no disability concerns or "accessibility" for the disability, it's up to the individual your working with to figure it out.  This is becoming a HUGE pet peeve for me.

Than I  faxed this letter, along with about 30 other pages of evidence (including my resume) proving my intelligence straight to the governor, my state senator, state congressman, and to the workman's comp board. I won my case and this b*tch lost her job.<br>  <br>  I'm still addressing this issue by going to college majoring in Computer and Electrical Engineeing where I'm due to graduate with highest honors, I'm also making a PowerPoint Presentation of every project that I did in college and so far I'm on slide 185, and I'm planning to attend graduate school just to prove to those worthless fools in political office that "Yes, the disabled can actually do more in life than push a broom or scrub some sh*tty, nasty *ss toilet." <br>  <br>  In 12/06, I faxed a research paper I did on the NCLB Act straight to the US Secretary of Education and to President Bush, after doing a research paper that fall. While doing this paper I learned that the states of Colorado, Michigan, New Jersey, and Texas were not only changing test scores to obtain more federal money but these same states were denying the learning disabled the right to an equal eduaction. In 4/07, the federal government made it a law that the standard tests will start accurately measuring the learning disabled progress throughout the school year starting this current school year.We shall see just how true this is.   <br>  <br>  I also wrote a letter to the Governor of Virginia last spring stopping Virginia's attempt to remove parental's involvment in the child's special education needs. They responded two weeks later and they did not like what I had to say; personally I don't care if I did get them mad at me, but they must have took what I said seriously because I heard nothing else about Virginia wanting to exclude the child's parents in their children's special education needs. <br>  <br>  My fight with the government will not end either until those fools realize that the disabled are equal.

bZo5Z53Uaa	Imaam Muzani, a companion of Imaam Shaafi'i said, "The Companions of the Messenger of Allaah (saaws) indeed differed, and some of them corrected others. Some scrutinised others' views and found fault with them. If all their views had been correct, they would not have done so. <br>  <br>  'Umar ibn al-Khattab became angry at the dispute between Ubaay ibn Ka'b and Ibn Mas'ood about prayer in a single garment. Ubayy said, 'Prayer in one garment is good and fine; Ibn Mas'ood said, 'That is only if one does not have many clothes.' So 'Umar came out in anger, saying, 'Two men from among the companions of the Messenger of Allaah (saaws), who are looked up to and learnt from, disputing? Ubayy has spoken the truth and not cared about Ibn Mas'ood. But if I hear anyone disputing about it after this I will do such-and-such to him'." [Ibn 'Abdul Barr in Jaami' Bayaan al-'Ilm (2/83-4)] <br>  <br>  Notice in the above hadith that the Muslim who knew the truth was permissibly angry at those who were wrong. The problem we see in the ummah is when one of us acts incorrectly out of ignorance and becomes very angry, insulting, or causing embarassement to another muslim when in fact he is wrong all along. <br>  <br>  Stop thinking you have to force your views on others, as though this is love.

mSQqEnuqaa	The origin of celebrations of birthdays is pagan & not a Biblical practice.<br>  <br>  “The various customs with which people today celebrate their birthdays have a long history.  Their origins lie in the realm of magic and religion.  The customs of offering congratulations, presenting gifts and celebrating—complete with lighted candles—in ancient times were meant to protect the birthday celebrant from the demons and to ensure his security for the coming year. .?.?. Down to the fourth century Christianity rejected the birthday celebration as a pagan custom.”—Schw?bische Zeitung (magazine supplement Zeit und Welt), April 3/4,?1981, p. 4.<br>  “The Greeks believed that everyone had a protective spirit or daemon who attended his birth and watched over him in life.  This spirit had a mystic relation with the god on whose birthday the individual was born. The Romans also subscribed to this idea. .?.?. This notion was carried down in human belief and is reflected in the guardian angel, the fairy godmother and the patron saint. .?.?. The custom of lighted candles on the cakes started with the Greeks. .?.?. Honey cakes round as the moon and lit with tapers were placed on the temple altars of [Artemis]. .?.?. Birthday candles, in folk belief, are endowed with special magic for granting wishes. .?.?. Lighted tapers and sacrificial fires have had a special mystic significance ever since man first set up altars to his gods. The birthday candles are thus an honor and tribute to the birthday child and bring good fortune. .?.?. Birthday greetings and wishes for happiness are an intrinsic part of this holiday. .?.?. Originally the idea was rooted in magic. .?.?. Birthday greetings have power for good or ill because one is closer to the spirit world on this day.”—"The Lore of Birthdays" (New York, 1952), Ralph and Adelin Linton, pp.?8,?18-20.<br>  Wholesome gatherings of family and friends at other times to eat, drink, and rejoice are not objectionable.<br>  Eccl. 3:12,?13: “There is nothing better for them than to rejoice and to do good during one’s life; and also that every man should eat and indeed drink and see good for all his hard work.

(Genesis 40:20) Now on the third day it turned out to be Phar′aoh’s birthday, and he proceeded to make a feast for all his servants and to lift up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the midst of his servants.<br>  <br>  (Matthew 14:6-10) But when Herod’s birthday was being celebrated the daughter of He?ro′di?as danced at it and pleased Herod so much 7?that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked. 8?Then she, under her mother’s coaching, said: “Give me here upon a platter the head of John the Baptist.” 9?Grieved though he was, the king out of regard for his oaths and for those reclining with him commanded it to be given; 10?and he sent and had John beheaded in the prison.<br>  <br>  True you might say that ,that would never happen today but is it harmless? Paul spoke and said:(Galatians 5:9) A little leaven ferments the whole lump.<br>  <br>  (1 Peter 2:21) In fact, to this [course] YOU were called, because even Christ suffered for YOU, leaving YOU a model for YOU to follow his steps closely.<br>  <br>  We try to follow the Bible closely and Jesus example if he did not do these things or command us to do them then we refrain.|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	Because it's a day of self-worship.

Pharaoh’s was marred by the execution of his chief baker, and King Herod’s by the execution of John the Baptist. (Gen. 40:20-22; Mark 6:21-29) Taking their cue from these facts, the early Christians refused to celebrate birthdays. Thus Augustus Neander, noted historian, says in The History of the Christian Religion and Church During the Three First Centuries: “The notion of a birthday festival was far from the ideas of the Christians of this period in general.” And the Catholic Encyclopedia (1911 Edition) quotes Origen as saying: “Of all the holy people in the Scriptures, no one is recorded to have kept a feast or held a great banquet on his birthday. It is only sinners who make great rejoicings over the day they were born into this world.”|`|XL25SEVnaa	Because there are only two references to birthday parties in the Bible and they end in death so they are taboo...ANY Celebration is taboo to JW's.

aPxmZq00aa	I was a product of the 60's. A few of the prevailing beliefs then were,"kids are very resilient, divorce doesn't negatively affect them."<br>  BULL!!<br>  <br>  ZERO POPULATION GROWTH- made you feel guilty if you wanted more than 1 child, (so I had only 1). BULL. Nobody else was thinking about it, especially in the other countries, everybody was busy having big families, at least 3 or 4 kids.<br>  <br>  My kid turned out pretty good despite that I had her very young, and was divorced and broke. By the time I got my life together she was grown and on her own. She isn't without issues, still never married at age 41 (maybe because she sees me now on my 5th), she's an only child, lonely without brothers or sisters, cousins, etc.<br>  Yeah I think our generation had influence on these Gen X kids, maybe we were just spoiled brats of the post WW 2 generation who expected that everything for us would be as easy and good as it was for our parents. We had kids young and half way let them raise themselves,because we didn't want to smother them like we were.<br>  Latchkey kids, yeah, I had 2 jobs, one in the day and one at night and still couldn't pay the bills.<br>  No I never expected today's reality, I couldn't imagine the world changing as much as it has in my lifetime.Only a few years ago did I slow down long enough to see the wake of destruction I have created .|`|AA12038658	My daughter was born in the late 70's, but I was a child of depression era parents. She has the work ethic which I and my parents had. She was sort of a latch-key kid, but I worked within walking distance, so if she needed me I was there.<br>  <br>  The only thing she needs to get over with our new reality & economy is that she has 'champagne tastes with a beer budget'. Both of them are working, but they're still living check to check. Every time they have a little extra money, they spend it!|`|e79f5e1a552ff5c84888995f3663d481aa	I just got custody of my two grandchildren the girl is 10 and the boy is 6 and they are teaching me a lot of things!!

As mine grandmother did, I was pulled aside for private talks describing what's wrong w/ "today's" world & how I need to be different than those shaped around me.

(They laugh at how I make most of my products & say that I was meant to be an alchemist in an earlier age, BUT they'll call when no marketing product meets their needs.)  I like to share my Faith w/ my grandchildren.  I'll let them know that this is not what Mommy & Daddy believe, but they have their whole life to learn about new things & they should not accept everything they hear as being true.  They should test information to see if it is good for their lives & those around them.  And like Granny told me, "Don't be scared to be different from those around you."<br>  2)  I didn't see THIS exactly coming, but I was expecting things to get worse w/ each generation b/c of the entropy the Scriptures teach.  I haven't been disappointed on that front!  (Unfortunately)|`|0rpN2419aa	I was widowed when I still had teens at home and I had to work to Support them and make house payments.  The kids are grown and most of my grand kids are grown  .   I have two great grand children.  Everyone is doing okay but it wasn't easy back then.  We didn't spoil our kids when my husband was alive and they grew up with good work ethics.|`|8G42oyydaa	I was a single divorced mother and my kids and the friends who hung out at our house, and other kids who had no place to go, all grew up to be employed, responsible, mature, hardworking, and not one with a drug or alcohol problem and not one unplanned pregnancy in the whole bunch. My son, the son of a single mother, owns his own company and is doing very well thank you.  My daughter has worked everyday since leaving school, they both have, and she as an accountant, until she had her baby. <br>  <br>  My kids NEVER had to fend for themselves, they HAD a mother. <br>  <br>  This is a stereotype, half the married stay at home moms who drove kids to things at the school showed up drunk. One of them had an accident and one of the kids she was driving was seriously hurt.<br>  <br>  My Grandson who is 10 is well mannered, intelligent, pleasant, cooperative and far from spoiled.  And I am pretty sure his parents will raise this newer one the same way. The way they were raised. <br>  <br>  I worked as a Youth and Family Counselor and easily 80% of the kids we had in residence came from two parent families. <br>  <br>  You know the kind that think they are "better parents" then single mothers just because there is a man and a woman living in the house? <br>  <br>  Never mind that dad gets drunk at the dinner table and whips beer bottles are his kids heads, or that mom is bopping half the guys in the neighbourhood and they get together with their friends to smoke and drink and swap partners on the weekends. BUT two parents in the house, hey that makes the GOOD parents compared to single parents.<br>  <br>  Having a male and a female adult living together under the same roof as the children means NOTHING.  It sure as heck does NOT explain the rise in juvenile crime if you break it down statistically. Do your research, most of the juvenile deliquents come from the burbs and most come from two parents families.<br>  <br>  If anything statistics prove single parents are BETTER parents. And all those women who thought having a husband made them better parents are now phoning my son and asking if he can talk to their junkie kids and try to get them into rehab. <br>  <br>  If there is one thing I CANNOT stand its a false stereotype started by married women who are scared to death of single women, because they know their husbands cant be trusted out of their sight. So they want to believe the single woman in the neighbourhood is immoral, a bad mother and is trolling for their husbands. Yah right. <br>  <br>  Thats my opinion on your comment " With lots of them divorced/single parents, that generations' children became the latch-key kids of the 80's. Latch-key kids had to grow up quickly and fend for themselves. "<br>  <br>  I guess you could say my kids have grown up as they were raised and  the grandchildren are being raised the same way, good manners, respect for other people, accepting responsibility, hard work, and determination. So this will hopefully be passed on down through the generations.  My mother was an abuser, thats ONE parently "skill" that was not passed on to my kids.  We all have the power to stop the cycle of abuse.  Its no excuse to be an abuser yourself.

No.  Have sexual relations?  Yes - or for a number of other reasons.  You could ask these questions likewise - tell us which you consider "wrong"<br>  a) Do you think that two people who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because of their age?<br>  b) Do you think that two people who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because of their wedding vows?<br>  c) Do you think that two people who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because of their close genetic (blood) relationship?<br>  d) Do you think that two people who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because one of them is dead?<br>  e) Do you think that two people who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because one of them does not consent?<br>  f) Do you think that a person and an animal who love each other shouldn't have sexual relations because of their species?<br>  <br>  If the bible is in agreement with your own morality on most of these - then how can it be wrong on that one issue (well, two, actually, as fornication is also prohibited).<br>  <br>  <br>  4) The whole God said man had to lie with a woman not a man thing from the Bible is silly...why would he say that, its just putting ideas in peoples heads?<br>  <br>  Ummm...he would say it because it is a sin that he wants us to avoid.  Isn't that obvious?  It's not about "putting ideas in people's heads" - in that particular case, it's about giving people the instruction they need to be gifted with the blessings of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) Most religions seem to be against being a homosexual yet it seems pretty natural...1 in 10 people are...if you dont call that natural then i dont know what is...<br>  <br>  Well, let's say homosexuality is "natural".  Let's say that everyone becomes a die-hard homosexual and that in vitro fertilization is not natural.  How long will the human race last?  Now, let's reverse it and say that homosexuality is *not* natural and that everyone becomes a die-hard heterosexual.  How long will the human race last?  Which appears to be "natural" - coinciding with the natural order of things?<br>  <br>  As for the supposed 10% statistic - so readily bandied about<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orientation#General" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic...</a><br>  it would appear that, worldwide, 4% is the maximum.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) should you burn in hell for something you cant help?<br>  <br>  No - but you *can* help it unless you mean that homosexuality is a psychological disease.

And all women are forbidden to teach men (I Timothy 2:12), wear gold or pearls (I Timothy 2:9) or dress in clothing that 'pertains to a man' (Deuteronomy 22:5).  Shellfish and pork are definitely out (Leviticus 11:7, 10) as are usury (Deuteronomy 23:19), shaving (Leviticus 19:27) and clothes of more than one fabric (Leviticus 19:19).  And since the Bible rarely recognizes divorce, they're committing adultery, which carries the rather harsh penalty of death by stoning (Deuteronomy 22:22).<br>  They wouldn't think of worrying about rules that seem absurd, anachronistic or - at best - unrealistic.

There is a difference between the reported "Memorial partakers" and those who legitimately have the heavenly hope. At times in Jehovah's Witnesses congregations around the world, known apostates will go to a congregation they have no ties with and will partake in the Memorial (which would make them counted in the number of partakers). Apostates are outside of God's organization and certainly have no hope of everlasting life in heaven or on earth. Only Jehovah God knows the exact number of anointed ones who are still presently alive on the earth. <br>  <br>  For the second question, we believe that it is POSSIBLE (but we have no definite answer) that when Christ brings the armies of heaven in the battle of Armageddon, some of the anointed may still be alive on earth at that time.

I am pretty sure she said in a sarcastic or upbeat way.  In spanish that expression is used in a sarcastic way to indirectly say 'so you think you are boss around here and can give me orders?' but that would be too long and too direct to say so we just say 'ok jefe'.  It's not a bad thing, that expression is very common and is not always used sarcastically.  It could also be a form of respect you could in spanish say 'ok jefe' to your actual boss, manager, supervisor meaning 'yes sir/ma'am I'll jump on it right away.
qpCUvqq8aa	Ancient Egyptian Government was dominated by the Pharaoh. He was believed not just the ruler but a god. Below him was the theocracy, controlled by the clergy. The Pharaoh's advisors and ministers were almost always priests, who were considered the only ones worthy and able to carry out his commands. Secular governmental officials included the vizier,  the chief treasurer, the tax collector, the minister of public works, and the army commander. These officials were directly responsible to the Pharaoh. The land itself was divided up into provinces called nomes. Each nome had a governor, who was appointed by the Pharaoh, and responsible to the vizier. <br>  <br>  As to ruling  queens to name two more, there was the widow of Seti II, Tausret,  who served as regent to his heir Siptah. When Siptah died, Tausret assumed the role of pharaoh and ruled Egypt for another two years. Her reign ended in civil strife and she was deposed by Setnakhte. She was the last ruler of the 19th dynasty.  And Nefertiti who is suspected of being Akhenaten's co-pharaoh.|`|D5RdQiJjaa	sorry,what is a thrown?.all i can tell you is during the thinite period,egypt was a state centralised around a royal power,administrative houses, like ministeries, were headed by high functionaries named by the king.he also named the governors of provinces.at the top the king had a Council of Ten,who assisted him.|`|68uyvAZMaa	yes|`|AA12152549	The line of succession from Pharaoh would begin with his firstborn son.  The Egyptian line was for the most part patrilineal, though there are two exceptions: Hatshepsut and Cleopatra.  They were the only women Pharaohs in the history of Egypt.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Yes, but we don't know a great deal about the finer points of Egyptian monarchy. Records, for obvious reasons, are patchy. And things changed: there were dozens of different dynasties, and traditions changed down the years. Egypt was around for a long time. The real hierarchy in Egyptian society didn't really centre on the monarch as much as on the priesthood, anyway - Egyptian society was rigidly religious and obsessed with religious rites connected with life and death.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14.

They are generally happy to poach experienced interviewers like you. I would actually have a look through the phone book or whatever for a new company and coldcall and ask if they have any work. Just say you are currently working for (the company where you are now but the new guys are closer to where you live.) Or maybe just pretend you haven't done it before.

It's just a part of life.  This lady sounds like a control freak, which is not uncommon in people who have supervisor positions.  You probably can't do much to be honest, you could try to find a new job, but there may be someone just like her at the new place too.  If there is someone above her that you feel comfortable talking to, then that might be a good idea, but even that doesnt always work. I've been in a similar situation as you, sometimes if it's bad enough, you just have to take the gamble and find a new job and hope things will be better.|`|grKtTRYtaa	I agree with Jm e.<br>  Buy a special little book so you won't lose your note.<br>  Everytime she monitors you, write everything down.  After 3, go to her supervisor, explain everything, ask him/her how you can improve your work to please her.  Be careful to tell you try your hardest and have no complaints from others.   You just want to do your job and help the company to succeed.  A lot of BS.  Insist that her attitude is keeping you from doing your best and you need to do anything to improve it.  Tell him that you do feel singled out and feel some of her comments are unnecessary and even hostile.<br>  There is a federal law that a company can be sued for a hostile environment, but you do have to complain to supervisor.  Certainly, do not suggest suing the company, but your supervisor should be aware of this.  My daughter was involved in something like this because her immediate boss would not talk to her (She had refused him sexually.)  She had complained to officials of company; nothing changed.  Her attorney said that she could sue.  She finally got a better job;  her boss was fired, however, probably for something else.  This sound applicable:A hostile work environment exists when an employee experiences workplace harassment and fears going to work because of the offensive, intimidating, or oppressive atmosphere generated by the harasser based on race, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, veteran status, or, in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, political affiliation, citizenship status, marital status, or personal appearance. Hostile work environment is also one of the two legal categories of sexual harassment.<br>  <br>  The anti-discrimination statutes governing hostile work environment are not a general civility code. Thus, federal law does not prohibit simple teasing, offhand comments, or isolated incidents that are not extremely serious. Rather, the conduct must be so objectively offensive as to alter the conditions of the individual’s employment. The conditions of employment are altered only if the harassment culminates in a tangible employment action or is sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile work environment.<br>  from Widipedia

Money doesn't matter to them.<br>  2. They stand outside the gates of the holy land.<br>  3. Yes, they will be brothers.<br>  4. Work together outside the gates of the holy land.<br>  5. Of course they'll know because they say "We are the two witnesses". <br>  <br>  Now, if you believe in any of the above, you must still believe in Santa. Supposively, these 2 witnesses kill anyone who opposes them (even though "thou shall not kill") with fire from their breath. The person who takes them down is the anti-christ which tells me that the anti-christ is more powerful than God. Just sounds like a bunch of bs fiction.|`|pqveENjUaa	My interpretation would be that the two would be political figures, either through courtrooms or pure politics, who rise against the anti-christ (who i think is going to be the leader of a power-nation, such as the US) and push him back into corners and talk circles around him, making him look daft and incompetent. <br>  <br>  That would describe "breathing fire" quite well, wouldn't it?
RNNdRHrMaa	Sweetie, don't be embarrassed.<br>  Easier said than done, granted. How old are you?<br>  You are probably nervous and not quite comfortable with your form.<br>  <br>  Just remember the lady in the shop will have seen many things in her time. Same applies with your doctor.<br>  I would suggest for future shop sessions, and swim wear shopping sessions, keep your underwear on. It is also good hygiene practise.<br>  <br>  Hugs sweetie X<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you believe the lady in the shop has committed an acto of Gross Misconduct towards yourself (which is likely, but she might have genuinely thought it wasn't a problem), if you don't want to go back to the shop (as someone above suggested), Phone and complain to the manager, or if it's a chain shop, make a complaint to their Customer Services dept.<br>  <br>  Nobody has the right to make you feel uncomfortable in your own skin, we do a good enough job of that as it is, with out strangers adding to it! I would urge you to register your concerns with the store.|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	She should've been more professional about how she handled this. Obviously, if you just asked for another size while you were in the dressing room, she shouldv'e been smart enough to know not to pull the curtain open. Tell her supervisor about this no matter how embarrassing (x 2) it'll be for you. Who knows how many people this moron has done this to!?|`|WuhIoS1laa	I can't believe she did that. <br>  <br>  That's just completely unacceptable, and I'd report it. Anyone dealing with a dressing area should know that the door or curtain being closed means an expectation of privacy. <br>  <br>  Generally shop keepers hang the garment over the top of the curtain, door or divider, not whip it open and expose you. That's just wrong.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	As embarrassed as you are, that was totally her fault.  You had the curtain closed for privacy.  If you meant for her to run and grab the new one and bring it back to you while you waited, you would have left the curtain open.  She should have respected your privacy more and at least pushed it under the curtain, or handed it AROUND the curtain.  It's just a good thing that no other customers saw your goodies.  <br>  <br>  Yikes.|`|swNHGx1baa	Don't worry, this was entirely her fault - I guess she just didn't think about the fact that you might have been changing. The reason why she was so embarrassed was probably because SHE made a mistake. In fact I'll bet you she's twice as embarrassed as you are.<br>  Embarrassing things happen to everyone. Just TRY and forget about it, though I know and understand it's not easy.|`|rThIVk2maa	She is the one who should be embarrassed for bursting in on you. It was an accident though, and I'm sure you will be able to forgive her for it. I'm sure nobody was inspecting your private bits in detail, and anyone who would admit to doing so is unfit for polite society.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	Report her for bad conduct, she'll get fired and you won't have to worry about seeing her again.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	what the hell she shudnt even of pulled back tht curtain without yur permission sue da B****t|`|1a624d54ff03d23031188c1046ca44e4aa	consider yourself lucky if it was a guy behind the curtain it could have warranted as sexual harassment again it would have been nicer still to knock on the wall assuming that it was a curtain type entrance so that you knew she was going to hand you something or she could have just stuck her arm through the curtain allowing you to take it from her and give her back the other one anyway whats done is done... but if it were up to me I wouldn't go back there anymore and instead shop around at a place like Walmart, Kohls, JcPenny or any other reputable clothing retailer that holds customer service not to mention privacy its top priority|`|hZco463faa	I would not worry about not going back because of embarrasment.  I wouldnt go back due to the fact that she probably did it on purpose and she was totaly hitting on.  <br>  <br>  The old lady wants you,  run before you become another school sex scandal statistic.|`|9136WNCzaa	I'd file criminal charges against here. A changing room is considered a private place, not public.

We all got a body and you didn't exactly run out of the changing room naked, just go in there and they'll just forget, dont worry bout it.|`|171a80e252b822a9deb861297f623e51aa	She's the one who should be embarrassed, not you.  She unthinkingly exposed you.  She owes you an apology (if she didn't apologize right then and there).|`|K3BHPtnXaa	She and her impoliteness must be embarrassed, not you!<br>  COME ON!!! You just worry to much!<br>  <br>  ;)|`|GBnj1lo1aa	ooh i would die of embarrassment if that happened to me, but just go in there one day face you 'fears' and buy something try not to think about what happened|`|w7XNcmihaa	What was her expression when she saw you, and what were your reactions? Post it in the additional details. :B I wanna know! >:P|`|0nUzzm0naa	just go back. I'm sure the saleslady was more embarrassed than you were.|`|AA11569882	Eeek!!!  But weren't you wearing underwear?  You don't try things on in the shop with no pants on!<br>  <br>  Yeah, I'd be a little too embarrassed to go back there...|`|MPX0f5jzaa	First of all, dear, she doesn't care, she's more embarrassed than you are.  I STRONGLY doubt she looked at your pubic hair, or focused on any other part of you either.<br>  <br>  You're fine, you were a naked one of God's creatures and trust me, nobody cares.<br>  <br>  Dear Lord, get over yourself.|`|fbGv4iZ1aa	Don't be your both women.  I remember when I needed to be "fit" for a bra size and was so embarrassed to have the lady measure me.  She said something that was so funny.<br>  <br>      " Tell you what honey, if I see anything on you that I don't have on my body, I will pick up a rock and throw it at it " .... basically we all have the same anatomy parts, nothing to be embarrassed about.|`|0704acd350dc509b1acb6896ab97e3d6aa	I would never try a new costume from a shop on my naked body<br>  I would still wear my knickers and probably bra<br>  that's more hygienic|`|87b6887f8f3651f24e111ac966c0f89daa	She's probably seen it all before as is as embarrased as you, I don't think she'll mention it again you'll just have to brush it off.|`|czAbrzcUaa	Okay, so whats your question?

ridu0Rtwaa	Christian Fundamentalist is a complete contradiction in terms!!<br>  <br>  CHRISTIAN – A follower or believer in Jesus.<br>  <br>  FUNDAMENTALIST One who believes the Bible is literally true and must be followed exactly.<br>  <br>  Therefore they are followers of the bible and not Jesus making them non Christians!!!<br>  <br>  But worse is to follow it also makes them ideologists.<br>  <br>  IDEOLOGY An idea that is false or held for the wrong reasons but is believed with such conviction as to be irrefutable.<br>  <br>  So Christians have a loving and forgiving god and fundamentalist - well - Just are not Christians!!!!<br>  <br>  So not only are they not christian but their ranting about hell and damnation actually drives people away from christianity!!<br>  <br>  Now come the day of judgment which direction do you think the verdict will send them in?  GOOD christians believe it will be very firmly down!!|`|yQNit56Qaa	Neither.  The instances around the world of actual persecution are hardly ever between Christian sects.<br>  <br>  Jim, Fundamentalist Christian|`|I8M5kw5Saa	As you will see from your answers it goes both ways...|`|RJRantBfaa	yea, it cuts both ways|`|Z4avhg3eaa	Fundamentalists harass, persecute, and actively try to take the control the law and government of this country.  They cry persecution whenever they meet resistance from sane, mainline people.  Meanwhile, if you don't voluntarily accept their values, they try to have them legislated on you.|`|Q1XUe0PDaa	Christian fundamentalists attack the American constitution and the American way of life.<br>  Patriotic Americans defend themselves against these anti American assaults.<br>  Christian fundamentalists  go after the children in schools.<br>  Humor and ridicule are excellent defensive weapons in the battle to keep American free..|`|Gf5nMPJXaa	Look at the US currency.  Does it say "we trust there are no gods"?<br>  <br>  Does the pledge state "under no gods whatsoever because they don't exist"?<br>  <br>  Are Xians banned from holding elected office in seven states?<br>  <br>  Are we being forced to marry the same gender just to annoy the fundies or does Leviticus prevent equal rights?<br>  <br>  Do taxpayer supported groups ban Christians and heterosexuals from their clubs?<br>  <br>  There's your answer kiddo.|`|tuULGJS6aa	The fundies have a huge double standard. It's fine for them to persecute people and start trouble with anyone who disagrees with their very naive beliefs, but if you chastise them for provoking you, then they say you're the one starting trouble.|`|AA11124121	i'm sorry, but labelling is'nt necessary, just say makind instead.<br>  <br>  Democide is done by evil men, and evil regimes, against other population groups..|`|NrzxtivLaa	when you consider that it was fundies that supported prop 8 in California, I'd say the latter|`|Xcri5qeTaa	Fundies can't take criticism.<br>  <br>  But they sure make no end to dishing it out.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Whoever cries "I'm the victim" first|`|4nAVWEjhaa	Christian fundamentalists "persecute" other people.  I used to be a christian and they would always attack me and others for every thing including sicknesses, or loss of employment, and voting for Obama.  They would call him Osama and that he should not be President because he is black.  They are so effing nasty.|`|K3TQT2rNaa	Both.  But really it's their own fault.<br>  When I was 14 we moved to a very small, very religious town.  The first question anyone asked me was where I went to church, and I said nowhere.  From that moment it was on.  Every time I went to school I was attacked by students, teachers, and even police trying to "correct" my behavior.  Every time my parents left the house they were pulled over and searched, sometimes for hours, always turning up nothing.  We were labeled drug dealers, gang members, cult leaders, you name it.  This went on for about 6 months before we just moved.<br>  So yes.  I persecute christian fundamentalists every single chance I get.  Because they deserve it.|`|QC7vlfPPaa	yes, both of those. <br>  <br>  It IS possible to persecute people for persecuting others. Do fundamentalists deserve it? yes, and more. they have remarkably free reign to say and do what they want... insult gays, ban them from churches, start political hate campains.<br>  In return they are (such as the Phelpses) banned from countries. They thrive on being persecuted.|`|FhHklqkhaa	fundies persecute others <br>  they claim it's about sin even though they cherry-pick from a mistranslated book and  rely on bigotry, hatred, lies plus intolerance<br>  edit: Fireball - 'beliefs' don't get immunity from criticism, many beliefs are just bigoted nonsense|`|AA11503457	I'd call what we get in the west more annoying than persecution, but we get it pretty badly in places like north korea, saudi, iran, pakistan, sudan and many other places.|`|UBdt4Wm0aa	It can go both ways, but I think Christian fundamentalists definitely dish out more than they get back.|`|J3884g1haa	I only persecute bible literalists with strong christian values|`|y0TB57IGaa	whatever persecution those fundamentalist bast*rds get, they all deserve it.|`|L8h9EHkeaa	Certainly the latter, in my opinion.|`|tOWqXCdtaa	I would have to say both.|`|szsSPSmPaa	Fundy's are persecution addicts.  They need it to feel right.|`|hEU4SlhTaa	What the Story That Was Never Told said. Its been a long time comin.|`|0yTM98Odaa	Christian fundies persecute others.

AA11785060	Loads more guys are bisexual than gay, dude. And you may turn him on just as much or even more than his girlfriend. Nothing wrong with that, he likes to play both sides of the field. More to play with that way.|`|2SrcH7bBaa	maybe he wants to have sex with you and his girlfriend at the same time|`|z2xRXM5Laa	Guys don't usually stop flirting with someone just because they are in a relationship.  Most guys cheat or flirt just because the opportunity is there, regardless of how good his relationship is.|`|HKXe27l7aa	its called Bromance<br>  its a special bond between 2 guys....|`|Ai4tL5G9aa	some boys are dumb|`|ehfzZwDbaa	Are you sure he's truly flirting, or is he just playing around? Gay men are born with gaydar, I've had similar situations in the past. Two of which have lead to me hooking up, and another time a guy had flirted with me at a party that was "straight", turns out he later admitted to being bi-curious. At the same time, I hang out with plenty of straight men who joke around with me or our other guy friends, and theres no doubt in my mind that they are straight. There is a chance this guy may be in the closet, or confused about his sexuality. One of the guys I hooked up with was a friend in college. We were not too close, until one day he asked me to hang out. Something was off with him, and I found it weird that he wanted to hang out just the two of us, and right after I had come out of the closet. He also had a girlfriend at the time( he didn't have one when we eventually hooked up). The more we hung out the more I noticed he'd look at me weird, he'd joke more and more about being gay( many straight men make jokes about being gay as well), and would make comments about how " if he were gay, I'd be his type". If you really want to test if he's gay, walk around shirtless more or bend over, see if he looks( don't be too obvious about it, otherwise you'll just look dumb and desperate). If you ever catch him staring at you, look at him and hold the gaze with a smile. When ever I caught this kid looking at me, I'd go over and ask what was up, and why he was looking over at me, this would lead him to blush....I'm also a complete asshole, so don't put this guy on the spot. Also it doesn't hurt to drink with him. Now when it comes down to it, if something does actually happen, chances are he's not going to wind up your boyfriend. In fact, from my experiences, and from hearing stories from other people, most of these scenerios don't go well. Both of the guys I hooked up with acted strange afterwards. I'm guessing they had problems with their sexual identity. So honestly, its probabaly not worth finding out, but if you really want to by all means go for it.|`|7umNEMLeaa	Males will usually flirt with a female regardless of their relationship status. I have found the reverse to also be true.

Lqy9Lc9Oaa	You are right!  You could fight it, but what will that solve?  I dunno..|`|AA11622716	I would guess that it is against school rules.  Schools can have rules beyond what is found in the criminal law.  Or, alternatively, they were suspended because the school officials believed it was marijuana.  I doubt seriously that they tested the substance.|`|ohEXIeDQaa	It would not be a matter of the substance being legal or not. It is merely a matter of the law of public intoxication. Public intoxication is not limited to alcohol and if anything alters the mind in the way that Salvia does (and I do know how it does) than this would not be accpeted in public. Your friends were very lucky they were not charged for this offense. Just because you are 19/21 does not mean that you can come to school drunk... I know your friends were MORE than fine in the school and none of us would consider this to be "intoxication" but the school is covering it's *** that's all<br>  <br>  I am not agreeing with it, I am just suggesting a possible explanation for the suspension.|`|7bIrMvziaa	Well even though it is legal <br>  It is still a mind altering substance<br>  It can cause distortions similar to mescaline<br>  So your question is basically saying if acid was legal we should be able to go school on it.<br>  That is why they got suspended<br>  And about the tobacco it's legal but doesn't cause a total mind dislocation lol. <br>  Damn this is making me want to to trip....

Christianity is NOT based on free will by the way. <br>  <br>  Ephesians 1:4<br>  <br>  For HE CHOSE US in Him before the creation of the world...<br>  <br>  Jesus said, "For you did not choose me, but I chose you."|`|GItBUBL9aa	You might not find the words "free will" in the Bible, but it's implied, such as in John 3:16 when it says "whosoever believeth."  That implies not all will believe.  "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."<br>  <br>  As we read on we see some who choose not to believe on Jesus and be saved. <br>  <br>  <br>  John 3:17-21,  "For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved."<br>  <br>  So, it says some don't come because they don't want their evil deeds exposed to them.  It's a choice.  Otherwise, if people have no free will of their own, then God is the author (cause) of all evil in the world, directing people to all sorts of evil.|`|Ll29odpHaa	It is implied but here are some scriptures to help<br>  <br>  Jam 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  <br>  <br>  Mat 26:42 He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.  <br>  <br>  Mat 12:50 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.  <br>  <br>  Jhn 5:30 I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me.|`|xLKPKgZXaa	The fact that Adam and Eve were able to ignore what God told them shows that they had free will? Could anything else be more obvious?  If they had no free will they would have obeyed and still be living in the garden of Eden.<br>  <br>  Free Will does not mean 'freedom to do what you want and still be rewarded', if that's what you are thinking. It means 'you can ignore me but suffer the consequences'. Some people think that is no kind of freedom but it is. We could all live holy lives and dwell with God forever. Those who don't, chose to exercise the free will God gave them to rebel.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	You decided to post that question rather than do something that would help relieve the suffering of another human.  Free will.  The Bible does not mention ice cream, i pods, irradiated sea food and I believe in all of them.|`|C3VD56hIaa	God told Adam and Eve not to eat the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge, and yet they did.............of their own free will....Satan told Jesus to walk away from his fate and he didn't....because of freedom of choice.....Quite often, how someone behaves speaks a thousand words...........|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Clearly is scripture it is taught that you are responsible,  and will be judged.  Since YHVH is fair, you must have the freedom to choose.|`|kw15nA5jaa	Galatians 5:1|`|6pgmp6Kiaa	We get choice.<br>  God nor the Bible can make us do anything, we choose to follow the Bible and Him or not.<br>  Its choice.|`|dXhmGkFqaa	that means no one forces you|`|2bC0dvPKaa	Do YOU think you have free will? You're not a robot, are you? This "premise" is fairly obvious...|`|A01w1dHqaa	People didn't used to question it so much until they started to believe that the outer world through psychology, evolution and genetics determined our lives.<br>  <br>  There were things like demons, astrology, hexes, etc. but we have changed these into scientific "truth."|`|YupMCYHlaa	The idea of Free Will actually goes back to the Greeks.  In the Middle Ages, Christian thinkers and scholars like Augustine mixed in some of the idea of Plato and Socrates into Christian philosophy.<br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't use the phrase 'free will', but Adam and Eve were made such that they had the choice to obey God or disobey him.  And they disobeyed.  That shows they had free will.  No other creature on earth has the ability to disobey God! (At least that's the idea.)|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Matt  16:27<br>   27 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to his works.<br>  Mark  10:28<br>   28 Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed thee.<br>   Mark  10:29-30<br>   29 And Jesus answered and said, Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's, <br>   30 But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and in the world to come eternal life.<br>  Luke  10:42<br>   42 But one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her.<br>   66 From that [time] many of his disciples went back, and walked no more with him. <br>  John 6:67<br>   67 Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away? <br>  John 6:68<br>   68 Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou hast the words of eternal life. <br>  1 Cor  3:8<br>   8 Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour. <br>  2 Cor  5:10<br>   10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may receive the things [done] in [his] body, according to that he hath done, whether [it be] good or bad. <br>   7 Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. <br>  Gal 6:8<br>   8 For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth to the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap life everlasting.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	to the 1st poster theres no burning!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  CHOOSE LIFE.....THAT PROVES THERES A CHOICE....USE INDEX CUZ I DK WHERE IT IS...|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Adam and Eve had free will, we are not robots.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	you get to choose whether you want Jesus or not.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Probably the words do not appear in the Bible, but the first time is when Adam and Eve chose to eat the fruit, when they were told not to, this was the first time "Free Will' came into play. <br>  <br>  After that, anytime anybody sinned, it was 'free will' that made them choose wrong over right. <br>  <br>  But a lot of terms aren't, or might not be in the Bible, like "free will', "Trinity", and probably a lot of others terms.|`|AA11992885	it doesn't<br>  the idea is derived because God is telling us laws, and why give laws if there is no freewill?  by giving us the laws, HE is saying we can choose to follow or break the laws......other wise, there is no point in giving us laws, as we will do exactly what HE wants us to do anyways, if we don't have freewill<br>  <br>  if we don't have freewill, there is no reason to show us the laws, this is most authorities beliefs concerning the reason for giving the laws, to show us that we DO have freewill<br>  <br>  <br>  unless the point is to show us that we do not have freewill, as, many will try to follow the laws, and yet still fail because we can not break away from whatever will is directing us.............this is MY belief|`|140b1c561177bc5cc3baf4ae5b15a6a8aa	By God giving a command to not eat of the tree in the Garden of Eden, the choice to eat or not to eat is left up to man. <br>  <br>  Deceived by the serpent or not, the command stands on its own. <br>  <br>  Genesis 2:<br>  16) And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat:<br>  17)  But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.|`|bglr4m0Naa	It's not mentioned in the bible... but it's implied.

I'm not a fan but i don't hate it. I just think rap music isn't what it used to be. But the point is that  Music is all music. What matters is the type of music whether it be pop, classical, blues, dance, rap R&B etc. Yes it is music.|`|JQXFG2ABaa	To my ears is just a load of ranting & aggressive raving. I don't<br>  consider it music which I thought was supposed to have a melody.|`|qGVBxZZOaa	I think it's talking with a beat in the background. It takes no talent to do. The only rapper I would consider even close to music is Lil Wayne.|`|CBgDc1Auaa	No.. I consider it some guy talking while some other guy goes "ahaa ahaaa"|`|AA12009576	i dont. the people who rap like 90% of them cant play an instrument so they arnt musicians mean it isnt music. thats my opinion|`|2DahzSWvaa	Yes.

BLnXhWoTaa	funny you should ask.  i just talked to my estate attorney about just this thing.<br>  <br>  it seems allstate only accepts properly certified death certificates on legal-size paper, and heaven only issues papers on 9x12 parchment scrolls.  since they don't have a file system for scrolls, allstate won't accept them, so you have to take the scroll to a mississippi judge to have it leaglly converted to an official death certificate.  then, you can submit that to allstate, but you have to wait 1,000 years until the end of tribulation to verify that the rapture is permanent.<br>  <br>  so i said 'what if i just report them as missing?'  he said you have to wait 48 hours to file a police report, and then wait for the police to complete the investigation.  so, you have to go to chicago to report her missing so you can bribe the police to close the case quickly.  the officer will usually accept a post-dated check so that you don't have to pay until you get your settlement.<br>  <br>  you lose part of your windfall, but at least you get to relax and enjoy the tribulation.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  the good news is that there will be plenty of preachers left behind to process your rapture waiver.  in fact, almost all of them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  don't get yourself fired, allstate doesn't cover that at all!|`|6wBi3hrCaa	This is a fantastic question, and the reason why I created getrapturecertified.com, the only website that allows you to earn a genuine certificate that shows that you are Rapture worthy.

So many people think that Lucifer is Satan—not so. <br>  <br>  Lucifer was a king in babylon:<br>  <br>  Isiah 14:<br>  <br>  12 How you have fallen from heaven, <br>         O morning star, son of the dawn! <br>         You have been cast down to the earth, <br>         you who once laid low the nations!<br>  <br>   13 You said in your heart, <br>         "I will ascend to heaven; <br>         I will raise my throne <br>         above the stars of God; <br>         I will sit enthroned on the mount of assembly, <br>         on the utmost heights of the sacred mountain. [c]<br>  <br>   14 I will ascend above the tops of the clouds; <br>         I will make myself like the Most High."<br>  <br>   15 But you are brought down to the grave, <br>         to the depths of the pit.<br>  <br>   16 Those who see you stare at you, <br>         they ponder your fate: <br>         "Is this the man who shook the earth <br>         and made kingdoms tremble,<br>  <br>   17 the man who made the world a desert, <br>         who overthrew its cities <br>         and would not let his captives go home?"<br>  <br>   18 All the kings of the nations lie in state, <br>         each in his own tomb.<br>  <br>   19 But you are cast out of your tomb <br>         like a rejected branch; <br>         you are covered with the slain, <br>         with those pierced by the sword, <br>         those who descend to the stones of the pit. <br>         Like a corpse trampled underfoot,<br>  <br>   20 you will not join them in burial, <br>         for you have destroyed your land <br>         and killed your people. <br>         The offspring of the wicked <br>         will never be mentioned again.<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see verse 16 tells us Lucifer is a man. Satan is not a man, he is an angelic fallen being. The only human in history to ever had seen Satan was Eve.

The popular notion is that Satan is the enemy of man and active in misleading and cursing humanity because of his intense hatred and opposition to God. Mt 13:39 would seem to point in this direction, but if one were to venture an opinion in a region where there are not enough facts to warrant a conviction, it would be that the general tenor of Scripture indicates quite the contrary, namely, that Satan’s jealousy and hatred of men has led him into antagonism to God and, consequently, to goodness. The fundamental moral description of Satan is given by our Lord when He describes Satan as the "evil one" (Mt 13:19,38; compare Isaiah’s description of Yahweh as the "Holy One," Isa 1:4 and often); that is, the one whose nature and will are given to evil. Moral evil is his controlling attribute. It is evident that this description could not be applied to Satan as originally created. Ethical evil cannot be concreated. It is the creation of each free will for itself. We are not told in definite terms how Satan became the evil one, but certainly it could be by no other process than a fall, whereby, in the mystery of free personality, an evil will takes the place of a good one.|`|1l74hQL3aa	Hw was young and thought his wisdom was equal to Gods,  He was kicked out God's bosom for asking the same question as you have, if God was perfect why did he not create a more perfect world?? Lucifer thought he could do better!!  So he was banished to a tiny spot in the universe - far away from the centre.  Here he experienced what it was like to be independant from his family.  As he matured he came to the understanding that what God had created served every purpose, Gods wisdom had been in fact much greater than his, and that God had forseen everything.  With this lucifer was filled with remorse,  and only wishes now to return to the centre of the universe - Back to God's embrace - Hence our innate desire to build space ships!!!!!|`|AA12193600	I'm sure satan rebeled at the concept of mass murdering the entire human race--the kill your son to show you love god put him on the edge.

According to the bible god is omniscient, meaning he knew everything that would occur for all time at the very first act of creation.  Therefore god knew what would eventually occur before he created the angel Lucifer (Satan).  If god knew that Lucifer would eventually "rebel" against him before he created him, and god is perfect and doesn't make mistakes would it not follow to realize that god created Lucifer on purpose?  Is Lucifer (Satan) not just following the destiny that god laid out for him?  Without Satan, god would not be able to play this little game he is playing with humans to see if they will worship him willingly, or if they will choose the opposing side of Satan.  IF Satan is evil, it is only because god made him that way.  If Satan did rebel against god it was only with god's full knowledge that this rebellion would occur and therefore not really a rebellion.|`|ZToZCLNBaa	The Bible describes it in Isaiah14, and Ezekial28, as having happened because his heart was "lifted up".<br>  He  wanted to be as God.

Mark Anstey. <br>  <br>  <br>  "It was definitely planned. He put a lot of thought, a lot of work, into it." <br>  <br>  <br>  "Dexter," a program on the Showtime network, follows Dexter Morgan, who studies blood spatters for Miami police but leads a secret life as a serial killer, hacking up victims in the name of vigilante justice. <br>  <br>  <br>  In August, Twitchell - on his Facebook social networking site - referred to himself in the third person, saying "Mark has way too much in common with Dexter Morgan." <br>  <br>  <br>  Another said, "Mark is set to evil." <br>  <br>  <br>  Altinger, an oil and gas industry worker originally from White Rock, B.C., disappeared three weeks ago. <br>  <br>  <br>  Police say the 38-year-old motorcycle enthusiast who came to the Alberta capital a decade ago, recently met a girl online on Oct. 10 and reportedly went to meet her at a southside detached residential double garage, where Twitchell had recently filmed a movie. <br>  <br>  <br>  He hasn't been seen since, but police believe even without a body, they still have enough evidence to lay a charge. <br>  <br>  <br>  "The movie was about luring a male from a dating Internet site and basically killing the male in the garage and chopping up his body parts and getting rid of the body," said Anstey. <br>  <br>  <br>  Police declined to reveal more details about the crime to protect the integrity of the investigation. <br>  <br>  <br>  The garage was rented separately from the house. Police believe Twitchell acted alone and didn't previously know Altinger. <br>  <br>  <br>  In the movie, the victim was also forced to reveal personal banking information and passwords for his social network sites. <br>  <br>  <br>  Shortly after Altinger's disappearance, he appeared to send friends an email message saying: "I've met an extraordinary woman named Jen who has offered to take me on a nice, long tropical vacation. We'll be staying in her winter home in Costa Rica." <br>  <br>  <br>  It said he wouldn't be back until December. Friends said it didn't sound like the normally reserved man they knew and Anstey agreed. <br>  <br>  <br>  "It definitely was not Mr. Altinger." <br>  <br>  Police say they also want to talk to a man who may have been lured to the garage a week before Altinger on the same premise of an online date. <br>  <br>  Two area residents reported seeing a man running from the garage on Oct. 3, eluding a pursuer who had been wearing a black-and-gold-painted hockey goalie mask. <br>  <br>  "The victim was able to break free and run into the lane," said Anstey. <br>  <br>  Police say the mask was used in Twitchell's movie and was found in his home in St. Albert - a city on Edmonton's northern outskirts. <br>  <br>  Twitchell was arrested at his parents' north-end home on Halloween and returned there with police a day later in an apparent search for evidence. <br>  <br>  Twitchell had been educated in Edmonton and was working on the fringes of the movie business as an independent director and producer. <br>  <br>  "The world is getting bigger and so is my influence on it," the father of two tells readers on his MySpace social networking site. <br>  <br>  "My lifeblood is filmmaking," he adds. "I'm hooked. "If I don't end up doing it for a living, I'll feel that I failed somewhere down the line. <br>  <br>  "My other passion in my life is my beautiful wife Jess. I've never been so in love in my life." <br>  <br>  In late August, Twitchell was between projects, so he posted a Facebook request for actors to work for free on a mystery thriller short titled "House of Cards," set to shoot over the last weekend of September - just days before the first alleged victim was seen running from the garage pursued by the man in the goalie mask. <br>  <br>  Among the advertised roles for "House of Cards" were: The Killer ("Need a male, playing mid to late 20s. Needs to deliver in a cold sociopathic voice") and The Victim (Male, playing age mid-40s). <br>  <br>  "I'm casting all these roles personally so just contact me through Facebook to start the process. We're short on time so the sooner the better," wrote Twitchell on Facebook. <br>  <br>  Just three days before the shooting date, Twitchell was back on Facebook. "Mark," he wrote. "Is gearin' up for a crazy weekend of filmin' action." <br>  <br>  On his blogsite, Twitchell says he doesn't drink, doesn't smoke and counts the "Star Wars" Luke Skywalker character as among his heroes. <br>  <br>  "Star Wars" has been core to his work. He had been finishing post-production on a low-budget tribute movie titled "Star Wars: Secrets of the Rebellion" - a work Twitchell's production company Xpress Entertainment trumpeted as one that emulates an "$80-million film on a budget of just $60,000." <br>  <br>  Though the project is not affiliated with Lucasfilm, Twitchell, on his blogsite, said it was his life's calling to fix what "Star Wars" creator George Lucas had ruined by focusing on special effects over storyline. <br>  <br>  "Often I feel beside myself, stunned that it's me who gets the divine opportunity to tell this story," says Twitchell. <br>  <br>  "I was born to do this and every turn I've taken on the path to life has led me to this. It's my destiny to revive the electricity of 'Star Wars' and invoke that chill in the spine that Lucas was too focused on the money to do. <br>  <br>  "He (Lucas) is more machine now than man."

But they imagined he was speaking about taking rest in sleep.14?At that time, therefore, Jesus said to them outspokenly: “Laz′a?rus has died, <br>  . 21?Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died. 22?And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.” 23?Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.” 24?Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” <br>  Jesus explained to them that death was a deep sleep.In speaking of death there was no confusion about it.. 21?Martha therefore said to Jesus: “Lord, if you had been here my brother would not have died. 22?And yet at present I know that as many things as you ask God for, God will give you.” 23?Jesus said to her: “Your brother will rise.” 24?Martha said to him: “I know he will rise in the resurrection on the last day.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) For the living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages, because the remembrance of them has been forgotten.(Ezekiel 18:4) Look! All the souls—to me they belong. As the soul of the father so likewise the soul of the son—to me they belong. The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.<br>  <br>  The soul is the person and so it dies also .<br>  We await in the ground until the judgement day Martha spoke of and we will hear Jesus voice and come out.(John 5:28-29) Do not marvel at this, because the hour is coming in which all those in the memorial tombs will hear his voice 29?and come out, those who did good things to a resurrection of life, those who practiced vile things to a resurrection of judgment.<br>  <br>  Hell ,grave and hades are all the same words not a fiery hell but the grave even Jesus did not escape this Acts 2:30,31 KJV<br>  He would raise up Christ to sit on the throne,he seeing this before spake of the resurrection of the Christ that his soul was not left in hell neither did his flesh see corruption.<br>  There is no fiery hell it is a man-made myth created by Dante' a loving God could never give the devil his arch-enemy permission to torture people in hell forever a thing that he would delight but on the contrary the Bible says that he will be destroyed forever.(Jeremiah 7:31) And they have built the high places of To′pheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hin′nom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.’(Jeremiah 7:31) And they have built the high places of To′pheth, which is in the valley of the son of Hin′nom, in order to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire, a thing that I had not commanded and that had not come up into my heart.’<br>  <br>  (Hebrews 2:14) Therefore, since the “young children” are sharers of blood and flesh, he also similarly partook of the same things, that through his death he might bring to nothing the one having the means to cause death, that is, the Devil;<br>  A person pulverized has no power.There are many other scriptures proving this point that Satan will soon be destroyed forever,he will not be stoking the fires of hell or be anywhere else but will be gone forever.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	yes I do and I will live again...|`|NOTc1b9saa	We are all spiritual beings within temporary physical bodies..We leave our bodies during sleep, thereby allowing our physical form to rest and recuperate and thus are unable to respond as spiritual us is not there until we return in the morning and awaken, and at death, when spiritual us gravitates naturally back to the world of Spirit or Heaven, in which there are numerous different levels, from the lowest, which could be described as hell like, dark, dank but without fire and surrounded by negative people, to the highest and beyond which are beautiful and blissful beyond our imagination..<br>  <br>  As God IS Love, to the degree that we live our lives with Love, we create within ourselves a personal frequency or vibe and when we finally vacate our physical form, we naturally gravitate to that level in *Heaven* which corresponds with our own level of Loving..Noone judges us..Noone punishes us, as it is US who, day by day create our future based on how we live our lives..<br>  <br>  Jesus came as an *Older Brother* to show the way, and taught us to *Love one another* and to *Love your neighbour as yourself*..Nothing could be simpler..God is within each one of us, the Spark of the Divine, which is our *aliveness* or consciousness and conscience..God is not just *up there*..<br>  <br>  So when we live with Love (and judging those different to us is not Loving) we can be assured of a Loving future..Noone *gets away* with anything as a result of that system which is foolproof..<br>  <br>  If we live selfishly and then confess on our deathbed or suddenly accept Jesus, believing that we then go straight to high level bliss (like those who act as suicide bombers believing they will then gravitate to *Heaven* where they will be given 24 vestial virgins). then we and they are sadly disappointed for there most certainly be great *nashing of teeth* and the like..God is not mocked..|`|I8yV5Hglaa	We.

I was raised Lutheran and you wouldn't believe how many hypocrits went to our church. Once I grew up, I tried other churches out and it was the same thing. Just a bunch of cult members encouraging each other to be psychotic. No thanks. I treat people with kindness and love and I do what's right in life.

Both good and bad persons go there, to await the resurrection. We have also learned that Gehenna does not mean a place of torment, but is used in the Bible as a symbol of everlasting destruction. In the same way, “the lake of fire” is not a literal place of fire, but represents the “second death” from which there will be no resurrection. Hell could not be a place of torment because such an idea never came into the mind or heart of God. Additionally, to torment a person eternally because he did wrong on earth for a few years is contrary to justice. How good it is to know the truth about the dead! It can truly set one free from fear and superstition.—John 8:32.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	what happens after death you ask.... you begin to realize that all your life you lived as a fool and faith was for nothing from worshiping air.

It trys to convince others that there is no purpose but those with any intelligence will seek out the truth.<br>  All religions give a slightly different twist on life after death. But it is sure better than believing in and worshipping matter.<br>  I like Hinduism/Vaishnavism which says that:<br>  Soul is eternal part and parcel of God. It's natural occupation is to serve God. Serving matter and taking the fruits of this world to serve the senses of the material body is called sin. The soul transmigrates through 84,000,000 kinds of bodies. The human body is the most rarely achieved. It affords one the opportunity to inquire about the meaning of life. Karma means that good and bad deeds recieve similar reactions in this life and the next. It determines what kind of body you get next. One should cease the cycle of karma by serving God. There are thousands of different possible destinations for the soul who dosn't come back to a body on earth. There are material heavenly planets called Svarga where they have long lives and no sufferring. Only enjoying. There are hellish planets. There are planets governed over by different demigods and there is the spiritual abode of the supreme Lord.

Otherwise you could put a suggestion in through your employers suggestion program that employees in common work areas refrain from cell phone use because of the work disruption it causes.  They should take their non-work related conversations to a non-working area like a break room.<br>  <br>  A point I would like to mention is that your coworker being Indian is irrelevant to the etiquette question being asked.  This should be the default position regardless of the person's country of origin.  The fact that your co-worker is unpleasant to deal with is relevant to the question however.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|WvUo4fi8aa	You are listening and bothering about others conversations too much and unnecessarily.

67f7a9562eea0008ccdd2892a04062f7aa	That would be a lengthy answer.<br>  <br>  Yes, it would be smart to stock up. I keep a years supply of food, powdered milk, and powdered eggs, and other necesitites. I don't worry about water because I live in the Appalachian Mountains, and there is fresh, drinkable stream water EVERYWHERE. It would be impossible for someone to cut off my water supply here. But if you live in an arid environment, I would stock bottles and canned water as well. <br>  <br>  Stock up on dried foods, and grains, powdered stuff, clothing, weapons and ammunition, and security items. Also, have several escape routes planned out for floods, wildfires, tornados, hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanos, or enemy (foreign or domestic) invasions. If you live near a faultline, know where it is, and the likely results of an earthquake in your area. It you live near vocanos, know how and when that one erupts. Plan your escape routes on the premise that you will be on foot, bike or horseback, canoe, kayak or rowboat, because in a emergency, gasoline may not be available for a car or truck.<br>  <br>  Oh, and now's a good time to practice living without electricity, gas or telephones (internet and computer included). Take a weekend, and make yourself go complety without utilities, and running water. It's not as easy as it sounds. Go camping and learn outdoor skills, especially tracking and foraging. <br>  <br>  The main thing to remember in planning is that you will get no help from the government, and they may, in fact, be the problem. You will be on your own. Trust no one, until they have proven themselves to you. If you are prepared, those who are not will try to steal your stuff. Be prepared to nuetralize looters, and other attackers (with extreme prejudice), until order is re-established (if ever).<br>  <br>  For a good example of what to expect, go to YouTube.com and look up videos from New Oleans, Slidell, and other places hit by Hurricane Katrina. Pay attention to the Authorities 'help' including the one where police brutally attacked a 70+ year-old woman, IN HER OWN HOUSE,  simply because she had a small pistol in the house for protection from looters, and the Government went out to illegaly confiscate weapons, instead of supplying food and relief for their citizens. It will be an eye-opener for you.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that the MILLIONS of dollars allocated to FEMA for relief to the people of New Orleans STILL HAS NOT BEEN DISBURSED. People are still living in Relocation Camps, years after the disaster (since 2005).<br>  <br>  Like I said, plan on being on your own......<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tLOQIdoSaa	It depends on where you live if you live in an area prone to disasters like California then be prepared, but it is best to be prepared no matter what.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet Courtney,<br>  <br>  Many of us believe that the Purity Ring is a good idea. Though realistically it’s a Christian trend it’s still a good trend. Also if your friend is sincere about abstinence then the ring is simply a physical reminder to self of the vow. Most Wiccans don’t need reminders like this, but if it works go for it. Also, if your friend is actually after an expensive ring or wants one because his friends have one, then the reasons for having one are not true to the Goddess and God and really is a show for friends and therefore having no value to true self nor to the Goddess and God. I recommend for your friend to think about what he wants one before getting one and also to consult the God’s for their opinion in this matter.<br>  <br>  I hope my blurp has helped sum.<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|LjsRfaskaa	A purity ring will not stop ones girlfriend from getting pregnant, use a condom.<br>  Purity rings are a stupid unrealistic spur of the moment fashion statement.

He needs to have a discussion with his mom about his beleifs. In my humble opinion a child should be free to honor the beleifs s/he has in their heart.

No, it can be any ring he wants, because this is about him reminding himself of what he stands for, and if he wants to make a public declaration of it then he should.<br>  <br>  I think it's a great thing! Just like everyone has the right to put an "Obama/Biden" bumper sticker on their car, your friend has the right to put a ring on his finger. <br>  <br>  So to answer your question - YES! He can have one.<br>  <br>  Take care!!! :)|`|pqveENjUaa	Why would anyone want one?

Iqp3ZUAlaa	from <a href="http://www.sandiego.edu/GEN/text/selassie.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sandiego.edu/GEN/text/selassi...</a><br>  "Haile Selassie was born Tafari Makonnen in Ethiopia in 1892. He married Wayzaro Menen in 1911, daughter of Emperor Menelik II. By becoming prince (Ras), Tafari became the focus of the Christian majority's approval over Menelik's grandson, Lij Yasu, because of his progressive nature and the latter's unreliable politics. He was named regent and heir to the throne in 1917, but had to wait until the death of the Empress Zauditu to assume full kingship. During the years of 1917-1928, Tafari traveled to such cities as Rome, Paris, and London to become the first Ethiopian ruler to ever go abroad. In November of 1930, Zaubitu died and Tafari was crowned emperor, the 111th emperor in the succession of King Solomon. Upon this occasion he took the name Haile Selassie, meaning "Might of the Trinity." This paper will focus on Selassie's progressive politics and attempts to modernize Ethiopia through technological advances and membership in the world community. Relevant to these topics is Ethiopia's struggle with Italy in World War II, Selassie's embracing of the League of Nations, and his popularity and attention worldwide because of his efforts towards humanitarianism and Ethiopian sovereignty. <br>  Ethiopia was a culturally and resourcefully rich land recognized by the European colonial powers as sovereign from as early as 1900. Selassie's predecessor expanded his empire successfully in the 1880's and formed treaties with the Italians, who recognized the imperial potential of northern Africa. Relations became strained, however, in the 1890's when Britain and Italy agreed that Ethiopia should fall under Italian influence. Despite occasional conflicts, Ethiopia under Menelik remained sovereign, and thus we see a stage set for the leadership of Selassie: a free Ethiopia with Italian, British, and French colonies nearby, and an Italian will to expand its territorial claims when its power and opportunity arise. (Marcus, 52) <br>  <br>  Well before Selassie's crowning as negus (king), he began work modernizing Ethiopia to rival that which he saw in Europe during his time abroad. He took steps to improve legislation, bureaucracy, government schooling, and health and social services in preparation for his new reign. More importantly in a diplomatic focus, Selassie acted to promote Ethiopian power and sovereignty and secure allies abroad. In 1919 Ethiopia applied for membership into the League of Nations but was banned because its practice of slavery was still strong. By 1923, working with the Empress Zauditu, the slave trade was abolished and Ethiopia was unanimously accepted into the League. He further acted to seek approval of other nations by emancipating existing slaves and their children and created government bureaus to do so. Also prior to his taking of power, Selassie promoted a twenty year treaty of friendship with Italy in 1928 and established legislation in 1930 to ban illegal sales of arms in Ethiopia, and to establish the government's right to procure arms for protection and internal unrest. (Marcus, 60-73) <br>  <br>  In 1931, upon assuming power, Selassie established the first Ethiopian constitution, which aimed to re-focus governmental power from many rases to his blood line solely. This move was effective in aiding Ethiopia's modernization through bureaucracy and solidarity, and forced the many regional rases to either oppose him treasonably or join him with their support. (Marcus, 98-100) By 1934, after several suppressed revolts, all the major rases were either supporters or outside the empires influence in the outer regions of Ethiopia. Much of Selassie's loyalty was fostered by the building of schools, universities, and newspapers, as well as increased availability of electricity, telephone, and public health services. The Bank of Ethiopia was also founded in 1931 and introduced Ethiopian currency. <br>  <br>  Though the changes in Ethiopia sponsored by Selassie and his new progressive government seemed very promising, there lingered a new threat to the growing country when Benito Mussolini came to power in Italy in 1922. The north African colony of Eritrea, held by the Italians, was harmonious in its African/Italian co-existence from the 1890's until 1922, when Mussolini's administration began to emphasize the superiority of Italian inhabitants, and even enforced the segregation of the population. As late as 1928, motions of peace were made by Italy, but it seemed as though Mussolini wanted Eritrea only as a strategic base for future conquest in Africa. (Marcus, 108) In December 1934, there was an incident seemingly provoked by Italian forces which involved an Ethiopian escort to the Welwel wells used by desert nomads. The League of Nations exonerated both parties in the battle in September 1935, and it seemed to Mussolini that he would not be condemned for his future hostilities. (Marcus, 148-49) Italy invaded Ethiopia one month later without declaring war; the League of Natio|`|m2zXOREJaa	He's a bloody good runner,he is|`|PO7eRrnLaa	He was an African emperor.

(less than 3% of all Masons) Even then, among these Masons it is a take it or leave it kind of thing. <br>  <br>  The particular passage you point out, inaccuracies of your transposition aside, actually deals with subject matter that was once a very mainstream Christian belief. Pike was born into a Massachusetts Puritan household. Among the Puritan faiths was a strong following of the work by Milton "Paradise Lost". It was in this poem that the fallen angel story of the devil was first concocted, and too it is the first historical reference where the word "lucifer" was attributed to be a name or title given to satan. <br>  Read Paradise Lost first, then study the Puritans, and then re-read Pike, you will have a better understanding of the belief system and historical context from which he writes. <br>  BTW, his books are not hard to find, most public libraries have a copy of Morals and Dogma, and most used book stores have several.

So I suggest it's up to you to deal with the issues of personal natural death - but it's also up to us all to do what we can about the stupid killing that humanity indulges in everywhere for all kinds of ridiculous "reasons" that all boil down to stupidity or greed (the same thing?) one way or another.|`|MM5iGrnIaa	You're dying right now.

We all sin, we all do things that cause us harm.  The main teaching of Jesus is that God isn't concerned if we sin, He's concerned if we don't learn from it.<br>  <br>  Here's a for-instance that is rather tame but gets the point across:  I love chocolate.  Seriously, I love the stuff, a "heavenly" day for me is to sit around eating bar after bar of it.  However, more than a couple of bites and I get sick to my stomach.  It is my unfortunate lot in life to have a bad reaction physically to the one thing I adore lol.  So, for me, chocolate is a sin.  It's bad for me.  <br>  <br>  After eating a couple of bars of it once, I spent the night in the bathroom and learned from it ... no matter how much I love it, it's not for me.  So will God condemn me to an eternity in hell for eating those two bars?  No, I learned from it.<br>  <br>  It's the same with any sin, with anything that causes your body, mind or soul harm.

Good people who do not know the law are saved through their good conscience. The judgment of a good conscience is still set against Christ's standard in a later verse. Lot was outside of Christ and was saved because he listened to the angels. Lot was one of hundreds in Sodom and Gomorrah. Sodom and Gomorrah were the worst cities. Every other city would be better than Sodom and Gomorrah and so by implication more than one good person would be living in those cities.<br>  <br>  The formula I follow is salvation is by God's grace through faith in Jesus. Then salvation is by faith alone but faith is never alone. God calls us in the first instance and then we respond with trust. Then responding with trust leads to practice the clean Christian lifestyle. So yes to question two.<br>  <br>  Is there such a thing as a clean Christian lifestyle? No it is an ideal. We are still burdened by sin no matter how much effort we put into it. As far as I know I suppose there could be a another sinless person apart from Jesus. Speculative but if Jesus comes back in the same way he came before then there could be a sinless person waiting for God to initiate the End Times. Correct me if I am wrong eschatology is your area of expertise.<br>  <br>  1 John 3:7 we are called to be holy as he is holy but again this is something that God's Spirit is doing for us to make us sinless rather than on our efforts alone. That we are aspiring to lead holy lives is an indication that God is working in us. So no to question 4.<br>  <br>  Fundamentalism arose to judge false doctrine. We can make judgements that some Christians are following false doctrines. By the same token fundamentalism can be accused of following false doctrine against the biblical standard. There are bad Christians everywhere and those so bad we can exclude from Christianity.<br>  <br>  Yes salvation is by faith. Bad Christians being saved by faith need to be open to the Holy Spirit to become good Christians so that those outside of Christ can know that they too can be saved by faith. I will stop here before I end up in Babbleon.

Luring people into carnal behavior for the sake of making money with false doctrines.|`|KleF4mohaa	It means very little to me.|`|7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	Balaam is known as a man who when he speaks, "Those whom he blesses are blessed, and those whom he curses are cursed."  A king requested Balaam to curse the Jews because he was afraid that they would come and attack him.  Balaam is part of the story where the donkey speaks with a human voice warning Balaam not to disobey God.<br>  <br>  The way of Balaam is to be a stumbling block to the faithful, and to be consumed with a love for money.  From his story, because he couldn't curse the nation of Israel and he really wanted the money, Balaam instructed the king how to draw Israel into sin so that God would strike Israel for him, Balaam wouldn't be breaking God's word, and the king would be safe from the Israelites.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	It is teaching false doctrines and enticing people into sin, for no other reason than to make money off of the listeners.  <br>  <br>  Many of the "TV preachers" are of this kind.|`|U1hGMckKaa	it means nothing to me.
tO9QjrEkaa	Great question. I never thought of that. Notice how those who don't understand your question simply cut and paste a bunch of meaningless quotes. Just as "Miracle" is another word for "Magical". "Chosen" is another word for "Conned"! Good salespeople can see when a potential customer is receptive and single them out from the others, or "Choose" them, for more indoctrination.|`|AA11232725	And if supposedly he did so, and if he supposedly keeps "choosing people" to this very day, then how can you blame the other 2/3 of the world who are not Christians for not being "chosen"..?<br>  <br>  Romans 9:14  What then shall we say? Is God unjust? Not at all!  15  For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."  16  It does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on God's mercy.  <br>  <br>  17  For the Scripture says to Pharaoh: "I raised you up for this very purpose, that I might display my power in you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."  18  Therefore God has mercy on whom he wants to have mercy, and he hardens whom he wants to harden.  <br>  <br>  19  One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us? For who resists his will?"  20  But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "Shall what is formed say to him who formed it, 'Why did you make me like this?'"  21  Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?  <br>  <br>  22  What if God, choosing to show his wrath and make his power known, bore with great patience the objects of his wrath--prepared for destruction?  23  What if he did this to make the riches of his glory known to the objects of his mercy, whom he prepared in advance for glory  24  even us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but also from the Gentiles?|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I'm sitting here contemplating how I can convey my thoughts without sounding either arrogant or delusional. Realizing, of course, that most atheists are of the opinion that those who believe in God *are* delusional.<br>  <br>  Without writing my autobiography to explain how I feel about being chosen, versus choosing God, I'll try to keep it brief and to the point.<br>  <br>  (Note: You always seem to put forth very deep, thought provoking questions. I should think a career in psychology would be right up your alley).<br>  <br>  I've always had some ability to know things before they happened - since I was about five. I was raised Catholic and at the age of 19 (1981), while living with one of my siblings in Texas, I was more or less converted to Southern Baptist. At the time this sibling gave me a bible.<br>  <br>  Having escaped the clutches of this Born Again zealot within months, I returned to New England, where I'd grown up. In the several years following I lead a life of cocaine, booze, sex and rock and roll. I always believed in God, but at no time did I follow a Christian lifestyle. I did give up the drugs in '83, and needless to say, grew up and out of the rest of the craziness over the years.<br>  <br>  I still "received" messages: fore-warnings, visions, and just "knowing" things in general. I never attended church. I was totally turned off by religion.<br>  <br>  I think it was in 2004 that I received a message. I was to choose God or my husband. I was very much in love with my husband and found this to be rather disturbing. I cried. I was confused. Over the course of the next couple of years the reality of what that message meant became painfully apparent to me. I found that my husband was a manipulative liar, who would just as quickly betray me as he would anyone else who impeded his path to whatever the hell it was and is he wanted.<br>  <br>  Although I had carried that bible with me for years, I had never read it. In 2006 I began reading it. I found that passage you're asking about and something struck me. I did not choose God. He chose me.<br>  <br>  Now, regarding people of other faiths. As far as I'm concerned, God knows no religion. God, to me, is just a name I use for a higher power than myself. A universal connection. We are all parts of one. How, or why, any one of us is chosen in some way is beyond my comprehension. For many years my lifestyle was nothing to be proud of, and certainly nothing that would make God sit up and take note on. I was hardly pious, or even ethical. Perhaps it's more a calling of sorts to that spiritual/universal connection, rather than the kind of choosing that many seem to glean from that passage.<br>  <br>  I still make no claim to mainstream Christianity. I do try to follow the simple teachings of Christ: to love my neighbor as myself; to do unto others as I would like to have done to me; not to judge, or condemn. While I don't always succeed, I know in my heart that I've come a long way. Perhaps that's why I am drawn to a Hindu proverb: "There is nothing noble in being superior to someone else. True nobility is being superior to your former self".|`|evStsOQiaa	Yahweh choose me after I asked Yahweh to give me new answers to old questions about what He wrote in The Bible and He did. Now He wants me to tell the rest of the world what I now know about Him.|`|E7fguoVBaa	Where is that Bible verse?  I'd like to read it if it really does exist.<br>  <br>  You really should quote the scripture and verse if you are going to claim that the Bible says something.|`|AA11703455	Jesus made the statements below<br>  <br>  John<br>  6: 44?No man can come to me unless the Father, who sent me, draws him; and I will resurrect him in the last day. <br>  <br>  65?So he went on to say: “This is why I have said to YOU, No one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father.”<br>  <br>  <br>  This pattern happened before <br>  <br>  Jeremiah 31:3?From far away Jehovah himself appeared to me, [saying:] “And with a love to time indefinite I have loved you. That is why I have drawn you with loving-kindness. <br>  <br>  This drawing is a result of people's appreciation for God's loving-kindness. <br>  <br>  With the nation of Israel, it become evident that Jehovah had a good purpose to be fulfilled through that people. <br>  <br>  With the development of the nation of Israel and thereafter, Jehovah’s loving-kindness in connection with his covenant continued to be magnified. (Ex 15:13; De 7:12) This was true in David’s case (2Sa 7:15; 1Ki 3:6; Ps 18:50), as it was also with Ezra and those with him (Ezr 7:28; 9:9), and likewise with “thousands” of others (Ex 34:7; Jer 32:18). In support of the kingdom covenant with David, Jehovah continued to express his loving-kindness even after Jesus died, for He resurrected this “loyal one” in fulfillment of the prophecy: “I will give you people the loving-kindnesses to David that are faithful.”—Ps 16:10; Ac 13:34; Isa 55:3.<br>  <br>  It is this loving-kindness on the part of Jehovah that draws individuals to him. (Jer 31:3) They trust in it (Ps 13:5; 52:8), hope in it (Ps 33:18,?22), pray for it (Ps 51:1; 85:7; 90:14; 109:26; 119:41), and are comforted by it (Ps 119:76). They also give thanks to Jehovah for his loving-kindness (Ps 107:8, 15, 21,?31), they bless and praise him for it (Ps 66:20; 115:1; 138:2), and they talk to others about it (Ps 92:2). Like David, they should never try to hide it (Ps 40:10), for it is good (Ps 69:16; 109:21) and it is a great source of rejoicing. (Ps 31:7) Certainly this divine loving-kindness is like a pleasant pathway in which to walk.—Ps 25:10.<br>  <br>  This lead to the directing of peoples to Jesus as was listed at the beginning. Jehovah sent John the Baptiser to announce the coming of the Christ and he gave direct guidance to those who asked him his purpose in his ministry. To his disciples, John clearly identified Jesus, and to the unbelieving Phariees, he gave a scolding about their lack of faith when coming out to be baptised. <br>  <br>  Jesus then commissioned his disciples to carry the message of the Kingdom to the ends of the earth. <br>  <br>  How does Jehovah draw people and why aren't all people standing in line to accept that?<br>  <br>  He has protected the Bible, so that today it is available in the languages of 99% of the world's tongues, some 2500 languages, has some or all the scriptures translated.<br>  <br>  People are drawn from all tribes, tongues, and peoples.<br>  <br>  Why not all? <br>  <br>  Because of the influence of Satan the Devil.<br>  <br>  2 Corinthians 4:3?If, now, the good news we declare is in fact veiled, it is veiled among those who are perishing, 4?among whom the god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through.<br>  <br>  He blinds them by verious methods. False religion, false hope based on money (Hmmm... sounds like something out the newspapers), and false hopes based on the promises of men. <br>  <br>  Revelation calls him the one "misleading the entire inhabited earth" at chapter 7.|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Both.<br>  <br>  Our salvation is predestined to be through faith in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. So we are predestined to be saved through faith in Jesus Christ. Jesus is the Lamb of God, since the foundation. He Is the Lamb of God without blemish, who is the Seed of the Woman & who wasn't born with sin nature nor did He sin when tempted of the serpent. Jesus overcame the curse of sin & death. He raised from the dead.<br>  <br>  And God so loved us first. And saved us from our sins. So we love God much, because He saved us from much.<br>  <br>  Really, Jesus is the predestined Savior. So? As soon as we receive Jesus Christ as our Lord & Savior & believe He raised from the dead, we are predestined with Him.<br>  <br>  The 7 eyes of the LORDs Spirit go to & fro seeking whose hearts are toward the LORD.<br>  Jesus said that if you seek with all of your heart, you will find.<br>  So we choose to seek with all of our heart. Many times God gets our attention first, and then we seek with all of our heart.<br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is chosen. And we are chosen when we receive His atonement for our sins & are born of His Spirit.|`|FK9Z75Staa	I think it had to do with the fact that Abraham was the only person stupid enough to agree to Yahweh's preposterous demands.|`|7lTNJsPDaa	Choosing is not a question at all.go through bible carefully before you have a question like this.|`|k3jqm2SXaa	1 who is yahweh?|`|KSCBdhDAaa	I ;honestly don't understand your question...<br>  can you explain???|`|TBZK5q78aa	What do you mean by chose? He created me lol...<br>  <br>  I don't blame the world dear. Pointing fingers at people for not being Christian is bigotry. I do not judge people based on their faith. I'm not a Christian. The term Yahwist is a bit more appropriate. <br>  <br>  What do you mean by chosen? This is no movie sweety. We all have vital purposes on the earth. Remember this isn't Hollywood, it's life.<br>  <br>  I think you are asking the wrong question here... What you are asking is why are there other names of God. God has a plethora of names. Everyone has their own conception of who God is. I call him Yahweh, but another person may refer to him as Buddha or Jehovah. Someone else may call him Zeus. Others call him Allah.<br>  <br>  We all have our opinion who God is. What's important is to help the world become a better place with love, not attempting to dispute others with futile attempts.<br>  <br>  <br>  In essence there is no "choosing". I was created by Yahweh and I accept him. Now my question to you is why do you care if you're atheist? Wouldn't this be a futile attempt on your behalf if you do not believe altogether? If you do not believe then please find something better to do with your life instead of attempting a futile dispute. I see a plethora of people trying this and it's absolutely absurd. Live the best life you can... That's my advice to you. If you are impious then you shouldn't waste time on such a topic. If you are baffled with religion and desire help then you should ask for help, and it's a whole new ball game.

xAL7OCUVaa	oh the big grin thing is a giveaway, thats what i do,<br>  i was walking through uni with a friend, and she goes<br>  "omg are you a lesbian!?!??!"<br>  right in this huuuge crowd of people, so i just kinda laughed at her|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	She's far from STRAIGHT. And she probably has that big grin because she wants you to figure it out for urself. Or she could be smiling because she likes you. What ever the case may be when tyhe time comes.....and it will. She will tell you if she is bi or lesbian.|`|3XLnDyupaa	Yeah, haha.<br>  She's not so smooth about her sexuality.|`|bd89db95a8636a616e42896cf49b6a87aa	Let her label herself.  She's not harming anyone.|`|v6tK8lhOaa	I don't think she's straight.<br>  When my friends ask me if I'm gay, I just start smiling because I'm too much of a wuss to actually tell them.|`|c0vuxtROaa	Uhh bi! Maybe not lesbian but biexual :))|`|R45yHlYjaa	i just think she is experimenting. are you out yet? does your friend know? if not tell her and then she will probably tell you|`|2TXCaLWraa	she's gay...or...she's gay|`|yXg1ojQoaa	lmao, i definently don't think she's straight, but you should let her label herself whatever she likes.<br>   Maybe she's hinting to you that she isn't straight when you question her? idk, she sounds as though she is curious at the very least.<br>  Lol, hope things work out :)|`|sTbUR32haa	Maybe she's a bit confused on her sexuality or she's experimenting...|`|52VDjbNTaa	That happened with my best mate, who claims she's straight.<br>  But my best mate is actually straight.<br>  It's really odd, haha.<br>  She knows I'm bi too...<br>  It's funny=]|`|9RYHLTPoaa	she's bi curious and really confused or possibly in denial!|`|chSN1wACaa	I think you should go down on her to find out :)
TuhSkNgWaa	I think it would be wonderful for you to learn welsh. Experiencing new languages can be healthy for the mind...and it's always fun learning new things, right? Even if people hardly use it, take pride in the fact that you'll be one of the few who took the time and liberty to learn such a language.<br>  <br>  I say go for it. It won't be a waste of time. Who knows? maybe you could teach a few family members or friends. <br>  <br>  :)|`|Dsp13qUxaa	Learning languages broadens your mind :)<br>  <br>  Who knows? You might travel to Wales some day and speak it...<br>  <br>  And I think you should learn it, even though few people speak it. You say you want to learn it... so why not to use that in your advantage? The key to learn a language is being willing to learn it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	It depends on what part of Wales. I have a colleague from south Wales who says that it's quite frequently spoken in the north, like something that you would hear on a daily basis. The official statistic is that about 1 in 5 people in Wales speaks it.|`|RLQPWkXCaa	Yes and no. I mean it's not really practical, but learning how to ski or how to get a good score on a video game isn't all that practical, either. If you're doing it just because you think Welsh sounds cool, or if you have family that speaks it, that's a good enough reason to go for it.
kkO87h0Xaa	I don't think there's much we can do about it, because it's pretty much a requirement to pass courses. I was required to read the Bible, and many religious texts in High School, and College.<br>  <br>  Last week, we finished reading "The Inferno" by Dante Alighieri, and there is a part in the Epic Poem that places Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in one of the lowest circles of Hell, and I was so distraught after reading that. But, I eventually learned to accept that it's just one Poet's opinion, and I don't have to agree with it.<br>  <br>  --Maybe you can discuss it with your professor, and ask to get your book changed?|`|UxYkISitaa	may i ask you a Q if you dont mind?<br>  haraam in what way?<br>  <br>  <br>  anyway..if they are really haraam...then dont do it...tell them its against your religion.<br>  i think you have freedom of speach ryt?? people who talk soo much telling islam duznt gove freedom should give freedom for you to tell them I DONT WANNA READ THIS CRAPP!!|`|khuhK4Gpaa	talk to the professor or deal with it. you decide.|`|xuZ2y3ADaa	talk to them about it, i noe these ppl are sad but tell them. u noe what im sayin gee|`|AA10080642	as-salaamu 'alaikum warahmatullaahi wabarakaatuh,<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can talk to your teacher. I was in a similar situation just a few days ago (Thursday) and I got quite worried. But one simple e-mail to the teacher explaining my situation to him got things solved (even though I had delayed to almost the last moment) alhamdulillaah.<br>  <br>  So, insha'Allaah, talk to your teacher and  insha'Allah, do not forget to make du'aa that Allaah gets you out of this problem.

Just read the book to pass the exame.|`|9d018ea4824b4530af398a953306530eaa	i think you have to read that book, anyway.  <br>  write the best essay as you could and score the subject.<br>  then the subject will be history|`|MfLhxmIlaa	Islamically, I wouldn't know what to tell you, sister because I'm not very knowledgable about these things so don't take my word but if I were in your position I would read it for the sake of just passing the class and getting it over with just because I've had these things come in my way at school and when I told the teachers about it, nobody cared and it only created problems for me and everyone looked at me like i'm an alien sooo uhmmm what book is it? who is it by? Allah knows your intentions and you're not doing because you wanted to but it's just a school assignment. Good luck :)|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yeah.. college's here corrupt good people..

AA12016117	As John T says, you don't have to be a supporter to send condolences to the family.<br>  <br>  It is a fact that George V (Charles' great-grandfather) was "helped on his way" to death by having a lethal injection of cocaine and morphine administered to him in his final illness.<br>  <br>  He died in January 1936.  "Fifty years later, it was revealed in the journal History Today, that he was helped on his way by the royal physician, Lord Dawson of Penn. Dawson administered a lethal dose of morphia and cocaine to the dying King, so that his death would make the first issue of the Times and would not be reported in the "less appropriate" daily newspapers."<br>  <a href="http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk/windsor...</a><br>  <br>  I don't know how far his family was involved, or their views or assent if given.|`|g4lLX3iaaa	I don't know that they support it but,as Sybaris has said King George Vl was sent to meet his maker a little earlier than was planned in order to get the information into the Times.A much larger than normal dose of pain killers does have that effect.The Royal physician was made a peer of the realm,probably for his services to the newspaper industry.|`|fI967FOCaa	He doesn't have to be a supporter to send condolences.
NNvcd5Bhaa	Yes you can. Everyone does sin. Confess your sins to God and repent (which means to truely change your way, and turn your heart to the right way). Also dont forget we are supposed to confess our sins "to one another" meaning fellow christians. I have done that, it is very hard sometimes, but the blessings that follow are more than worth it. Because I feel that God knows how difficult it was, and sees how committed I am, and therefore gave me a more powerful spirit filled relationship with Him. May God bless your walk, and your seeking truth.|`|AA11812065	no one can recieve the holy spirit since christ's days. The apostles had it for a reason, when they died there was no more holy spirit, it was used for a purpose back then. we have the bible today that has taken the place of the holy spirit.|`|tIAfq7MQaa	God is waiting for you to recieve his free gift.<br>  Everyone has sinned (except jesus)<br>  1. You just have to ADMIT you are a sinner to him<br>  <br>  2.

If you are baptised (assuming you haven't already) you can receive the Holy Spirit.|`|lUuxrGAtaa	You can recieve the Holy Spirit, but yes I do believe that you need to confess and give your sins to Jesus before that. Good luck and i'll pray for you :)|`|1248b5e8412b739c11cc6e8030453c14aa	According to the common belief yes you can, you must pray and tell God your sins and ask forgiveness.

XVVl7rycaa	its disgusting, why destroy the only body we are given, cause there are people in hospitals with diseases and such that they never did anything bad to get, and smokers are ruining their bodies just to be cool, when the people in the hospital with cancer and such would like their body and discard those habits|`|jIS8JBiJaa	smoking is nasty some people think its cool but here are some facts that will happen if you smoke even just once:<br>  <br>  bad breathe<br>  <br>  yellow teeth<br>  <br>  weak lungs<br>  <br>  poor eye sight<br>  <br>  may shut down liver<br>  <br>  one time of smoking is like smoking your whole life <br>  its not cool and you shouldnt do it|`|AA11146636	All of it is nasty.

KBBonf97aa	The chemicals in colognes react differently with individual body chemistries, so you'll have to try a few and see which ones work for you.  It's probably best to steer clear of really popular scents, since everyone else will be wearing them.  But if you talk to someone at the men's cosmetics counter at a department store, he'll be able to give you suggestions for colognes that are a little more obscure, but still potent.  If you wear a scent everyone else is wearing, you'll just be another piece of beef in the herd.  But if you choose something relatively uncommon, it could well become your signature scent.  <br>  <br>  If all else fails, you can't go wrong with steak sauce!|`|UyDkYaXuaa	Hmm...

eSfCTgHAaa	Indeed this is sad.  It is so sad that latest "philosophy" man came with is called - existentialisms - which in so many words says exactly what you just recited:  You are alone in the world, life sucks and then you die.  These people ware black and smoke cigarettes profusely in dimly lit establishments around bad parts of town.<br>  <br>  UNLESS, my brother...  Unless, you fall to your knees and accept the ONLY Lord and Savior, who died for your sins, resurrected the third day and sat down at the right hand of righteousness, until the Father will put all the world under his feet and YOU will be with him.<br>  <br>  See you among the living.  God bless.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	I think that the best and most noble thing we can do is to love, even those who are unlovable. The effects of love do make a difference, if you do not believe this then consider the following statement. 2000 years ago one man loved even the unlovable enough to die for them and today we still preach His message of love. Intellect will never satisfy or save you, only faith in Jesus Christ will do that. Peace to you...|`|cECRv4NMaa	Each of us has a purpose in life. I believe that we were given dominion over the earth, animals and all that are weaker than us. We are caretakers of this world. Pleasure is good, but not at the expense of ruining everything around us. And no, I am not politically correct, a tree hugger, nor do I believe in global warming. What is happening to the earth has happened before and anyone who it arrogant enough to believe that we are the only ones who cause this are rather thick headed. Now this doesn't mean we should abuse our time on earth, but that also doesn't mean that we should hold back when we have the chance to have our own gas here in the USA because we are afraid to ruin the environment. After all, with all our technology we can do it safely! It is not like we are technically challenged like say 20 years ago!|`|1zfwLsQpaa	Back in the caveman days life was about surviving and assuring reproduction and survival of your species...<br>  <br>  these things are set by the devil to lure us into his traps, followers of god regardless of what religion they call themselves know that they must blindly say NO to these because not everything that shines is gold...|`|SPNHhFXoaa	Everyone's purpose is different.|`|9b5935684568a7cb72fa426091885e25aa	We were created to please the creator we were created to worship him|`|tCxUEartaa	Pleasing our body and pleasing our mind are closely related to our predilictions.  Each individual in this respect is different.  If you find pleasure in serving others, it is your attitude.  And if you want to exploit others and enjoy that also is a matter of attitude.  To get pleasure from positive attitude is a desirable trait.  Everyone is selfish to the extent that whatever they do is for their pleasure.  And if anybody does anything that we don't like, we blame them. That is an immature way unless he is antisocial.  The smooth existence of social routine is necessary for existgence.|`|NqMx7YOtaa	I think living to please your body is selfish. I think that life is short and we die in the end; therefor we should live with some form of purpose.

IMKApyRDaa	Colonel Sanders of the Kentucky Fried Chicken fame said after his becoming a Christian "not everyone can be right". That is a profound statement. Not every religion can be correct. If you think about it logically this has to be true. God is not universal. Christianity is controversial because it claims a unique Son Of God and that there can be no other and that you can't be justified by your good behavior (works). Works can make a statement about your faith but they cannot save you. Christianity makes no provision for other religions and that makes it a divisive and possibly a controversial religion. If you are a Christian you are a rebel, you are telling other religions they are false religions and to evolutionists that they are modern idol worshipers because they are figuratively bowing down to an image of an simple animal declaring "behold my creator" through the avenue of an endless number of "good" birth defects. Christianity is about God reaching down to man, other religions are about man trying to reach up to God. You don't need a lot of faith just childlike faith, or like a mustard seed that grows. Don't be discouraged if you do have doubts about your faith. Doubts being answered is how your faith grows. Its a process.|`|ef4edd8f1c0d16fab298d474bf08b339aa	If you make rules God has to live by, then you are straying off the path He made. Suit yourself.<br>  <br>  I am only telling you what God said.

It tells us that we are saved by faith through grace, It is in Ephesians 2:8, it also says it is a gift of God. And in verse 9 he clearly states that it is not of works. Works after you are saved has to do with your rewards not with your initial salvation. God is not going to ask about your salvation, he will already know everything when you get there.|`|Hp2DKNH5aa	Who said God is universal?<br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: <br>  no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<br>  If ye had known me, ye should have known my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him.  John 14:6-7<br>  <br>  Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:<br>  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

The Bible says that whoever believes in Jesus will be saved. The word believe, however, means more than just believing that Jesus existed, but it means to commit your life to Him simply by asking Jesus to come into your life to be your Savior and Lord. To do this, you must be willing to repent from your sins. So basically, to be saved you must:<br>  <br>  1. Believe that Jesus died on the cross because of our sins.<br>  2. Realize that you are a sinner<br>  3. Ask Jesus to come into your life by repenting from your sins.<br>  <br>  The Bible says this in many areas. Perhaps the best verse is John 3:16. <br>  <br>  I hope this clears things up for you. If not I'd be more than happy to go into this further with you.|`|Z7TloxtOaa	eeek lady, it does not only depend on faith, it depends on sooo much more.<br>  1. have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal Savior?<br>  2.

Good works follow the new birth and are evidence of salvation but they don't add to the finished work of the Lord Jesus on the cross.<br>  <br>  Good works don't cancel out sins just like telling a judge about all of the times you were doing good deeds instead of breaking the law don't get you off. Faith means trusting in what the Lord Jesus did on the cross as payment for your sin debt. If you don't trust in that then you have to stand before God on judgment day with your sins still on your record.<br>  <br>  Romans 5:8  But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.  9  Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.<br>  <br>  Romans 6:23  For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:1  And you  He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins,  2  in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience,  3  among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others.  <br>  <br>  4  But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us,  5  even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved),  6  and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,  7  that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.  <br>  <br>  8  For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,  9  not of works, lest anyone should boast.  10  For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.|`|AA10057370	God is not "politically correct".<br>  People that oppose God have no authority to decide how God can be.<br>  OT and NT both teach God apposes all other gods and doctrines.<br>  <br>  Please read the bible to see what God says not what liberals tell you He has to be.<br>  <br>  Please read to understand:<br>  <br>  Eph 2:8-9<br>  John 3:15-21<br>  Acts 2:21,4:12<br>  Galatians<br>  Romans 10

JXMpZiwxaa	We have nothing against praying in the presence of a statue.  The statues merely serve as reminders of the people they represent.  We ask Mary to pray to God for us. Catholics use the term "pray" to mean "talk," rather than "worship."<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|Bqoydq1Oaa	We have statues of Mary, crucifixes, medals, and images, just like there are statues of famous people, just like when people keep images of their loved ones in their wallets. They are objects that remind us of who we love, and help us focus on God. They help us with focus in prayer and worshiping God. If we were to actually worship the statue, then that is idolatry, and if we had to do that, I'd be out of the Church right away.<br>  Also, for something to be a sin, it has to be conscious and intentional. You can't accidentally sin. <br>  <br>  =) Thank you for your sincerity.|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	When you as a Muslim pray on your prayer rug, are YOU subconsciously committing an act of idolatry with the prayer rug? Or, since you're facing Mecca, does Mecca subconsciously become an idol? In both cases, the answer is no. <br>  <br>  We are not sinning, nor are we subconsciously committing a form of idolatry. The statue represents Mary, but the statue is not Mary. And, you are correct to say that we are not worshiping Mary, because we are not. Sometimes, we also pray in front of the statue of a particular saint. More often, we pray in front of a crucifix, since Christ is at the center of everything. <br>  <br>  When we pray to Mary or any of the saints, we are praying in the original form of the word "pray," which means "to ask." We are asking Mary and the saints to pray for us. <br>  <br>  The use of statues and icons goes back to ancient times. Religious art was all over Solomon's temple. The Ark of the Covenant was adorned with two cherubim. So obviously, religious artwork is not what God banned, but using artwork as if the piece of art were a deity. That is idolatry. When the Hebrews made the golden calf, they were not committing idolatry. It was not until they worshipped the calf as a god that they committed idolatry. <br>  <br>  As the Church came into being, we faced a lot of persecution until about the year 300. We had to use secret symbols in order to communicate. Even once we were able to communicate with other Christians freely, however, the majority of us could not read. Before the 16-1700s, or so, you were only able to read if you were nobility, a member of the clergy, or, occasionally, a very highborn woman or nun. <br>  <br>  Statues and icons became widely used because the majority of the population just could not read. They needed to get the information somehow. Statues and icons, both of stories from the Bible and Biblical figures as well as of the saints, served to tell the stories of the Bible and of the saints lives. <br>  <br>  Mary's extreme faith in God, as well as her sinlessness, makes her the perfect example of how to live a good, faithful life. Because she is the mother of God (for to deny Mary this title is to deny Jesus His), her prayers hold a greater power than the prayers of those still on earth, for Jesus can not deny His mother that which she asks. That is how much He loves His mother.  <br>  <br>  The same applies to the saints, having been perfected in love and alive in Heaven. Their prayers, though not as powerful as Mary's, are still more powerful than ours. <br>  <br>  So, we use the statues and icons to remind us of these holy people, and when we pray to them, we are only doing so to ask them to pray for us, much the same as asking anybody else to pray for us here on earth.|`|74b1131cf5ddd01a70564ef108e130bfaa	Art ... check your own house and garden.  If you have figurines of any sort -- you know, representations of created things, I'm sure you know the criteria -- then you'd best get rid of them if indeed "having a statue is a sin".  <br>  <br>  Original poster: No, we do not worship the statues, nor the saints they represent.

Saints are not miracle workers, even though many people mistakenly feel that they are.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	The Catholic Church absolutely condemns idolatry in every form, and describes it as "incompatible with Christian life" (see the Catechism of the Catholic Church).  Praying while in front of a statue is not idolatry.  Worshipping the statue or the person it represents would be idolatry, and in my opinion probably insanity as well.  Tell me this ... if you did accept that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the human race, and God incarnate, would you consider it appropriate to honor the woman whose cooperation with God's plan made it possible for Him to come to us?|`|h5q89E3Haa	It is no more Idolatry than The Kaaba and the contents within are false worship.<br>  <br>  So we could say the same about Muslims could we not?<br>  <br>  The Blessed Virgin Mary(PBUH) is revered even in the Qu'Ran so as a Muslim you should know this.<br>  <br>  It is understandable that as a Muslim any image of a living person such as Mary(PBUH) would offend you but as Catholics we honor her not her image but we do not have the same restrictions muslims do on images.<br>  <br>  Glory be to God.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|sebhK7r7aa	It is important to know that they do not worship Mary, they just have great respect for her, and pray for her to intercede for them.

This seems to be popular among high school students but it could also be a trend like many of the fashion statements such as Emo or Goth. Last night one of our group said that one of her classmates claimed to be a Catholic/Wiccan. Being as the Christian belief forbids worship of other "Gods" they are not compatible but I have also heard an ignorant statement of justification that, it is right that you cannot worship another "God" but it is ok to worship the "Goddess."<br>  It seems that many of the people who claim to combine opposing faiths are dissatisfied and not fulfilled by their origional religion but do not have the courage to find a path that gives them a personal relationship with that which they can accept and believe to be "God" even if it is a denial of "Gods" existance. This may also be due to their family or social situation and the often ignorant ideas some believers have about other paths. Being eclectic among Pagan religions is common but they do not oppose each other. <br>  <br>  Often claiming to be "Christian/Wicca" or "Christian/Pagan" is the first step toward becomming Wiccan or another path of Pagan belief. I have seen this happening for over 10 years and often enough when the person learns and gains experiance, I have heard the person refer to themself as a "Recovered Christian." (Not my words.) This may show the effect of having a belief that does not fit ones personal path pushed upon them by outside influences.|`|DVGJWZMyaa	I think that this is unique. You need a belief that sees conversion at all costs as its main religious duty. The religion also needs to see dishonesty and misrepresentation as a valid tool of evangelism. I can only think of two major religions that fit this category, and as far as I know Christianity is the only one that has attempted it.|`|8I9uduIiaa	The same evangelical Christians who pose as 'messianic jews' are now starting to pose as 'messianic muslims':<br>  <a href="http://www.letusreason.org/Current57.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.letusreason.org/Current57.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://op.50megs.com/ditc/orrel5.html" rel="nofollow">http://op.50megs.com/ditc/orrel5.html</a>|`|DeF8Ir5naa	Uh, I don't think they've been successful.

5HcnqxKQaa	I suppose being sensitive also means giving in to others as one is concerned about their needs/feelings, and some people may confuse that for being weak by not standing up for one's own preference.<br>  <br>  The same can be said for opinions. Maybe someone who is sensitive is less confrontational, and would prefer not to argue the point when they believe in something different. They may think that arguing is pointless, and that it's far better to just shrug or nod in order to keep the peace.
9YMLsk7Taa	I think its cause we live in a "more, more, more" society. We are taught that if we fight hard enough we can have the American dream.

Peace to you....|`|FmazIF6Maa	I think this points more towards greed being the problem, rather than wealth itself.

Very sweet gesture.|`|H5nBLB9Zaa	To be honest, i have never heard of a thank you card for having someone over for dinner. i guess that's because my family has always been social growing up and we always had people over all the time for dinner on the weekends. my dad loved to entertain. never once did we receive a thank you note.  I think if someone did send one, my parents would have been very appreciative of the thoughtfulness.<br>  <br>  Also, the fact that he asked you if you enjoyed it might be sort of a hint that he wanted a "thank you" of some sort, do you know what i mean?  It's kind of like giving someone a gift and constantly asking the person if they like the gift.. it's like they are asking for the thank you.<br>  <br>  so in conclusion, either way, and especially if you were considering sending one anyway, i think you should definitely send it!!!|`|d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	A thank you card is ALWAYS proper, even if one talks on the phone and gives thanks over the phone prior to mailing a card.<br>  <br>  P.S.  it's "My husband and I" ... thanks.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a polite day.|`|AA12204752	A thank you card is perfect.

f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Fundamentalists have some persuasive arguments in such cases, such as "scientists don't know what they are talking about", or "the ways they are measuring such things are flawed".|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I think the Earth is probably a few billion years old,  but I don't know.

It would still be conceivable that our planet is a lot younger.<br>  <br>  Your argument supports claims that the universe is billions of years old.   The Catholic Church teaches,  and I believe, that God created the universe and everything in it.  I don't know when God started Creating,  and I don't know how He Creates anything.

Four year old children can identify the inconsistencies and errors in their beliefs. Oddly this does not deter them.<br>  <br>  The YEC idea that the Creation Myth in Genesis is literally true does not sit well with astronomy. <br>  <br>  Genesis opens with "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." It does not state that God created the universe, then waited about 13999994000 years to create the Earth.<br>  <br>  At best they can debate about the meaning of the word "day" in the passages, but this moves away from the literal interpretation of the bible. If Gods word can be so vague about this, why should everything else be taken at face value? Creationism of any breed is based on confusion and misunderstanding. It withers under scientific evidence, and as a result creationists fear and avoid science when ever possible.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Every bit of scientific evidence, in every scientific discipline points to the Earth being around 4.5 billion years old. The idea that there is any dispute, or that more than a handful of people dont know this, is insane.|`|303F69Woaa	Just to punch a hole in your theory. God could have created the Andromeda Galaxy 2.2 million years ago then created the earth 6000 years ago and the light from the Andromeda Galaxy would already be where he created the earth. I believe though that the earth is millions of years old.|`|stD322SIaa	Yeah, Carl Sagan said that would require god to create a column of light in the shape of a galaxy that far away, which would be such a deceitful god that he didn't want to believe in it.|`|hrmJaGWCaa	Didn't you know light was created old ?

Actually, God foreknew that they would.  Think about it.  2 Freshly, created, human beings placed within a paradise with 2 trees, of which one was forbidden to be accessed.  Now; you throw in a extremely cunning, subtle, Angelic being called Satan [Adversary] and you don't inform neither of them about this Satan.  God full well knew they would bite !  The problem was not with God but Adam & Eve had to come to see through experience that they had this proclivity towards sin already within them.  (We refer to it as "human nature") .  God wanted a special relationship with His human creation, that is why later, after they played the blame game with God that He offered His Son [Jesus] as a sacrifice for the sins of all humans, thereafter.

67Lvls2zaa	I'm guessing this goes along with the hypothetical situation that he doesn't return then? In 5000 years, Christianity will have changed with the people just as it has changed since the time of Jesus. Think about how Judaism has changed. The religion changed many times over way before Christ! He preached Judaism and how they were serving God wrong, what they needed to do, how, when, why... etc. He spoke the word of God and now all of that is the very foundation of Christianity. Since the formation of Christianity, hundreds of churches have branched off, reformed, and spread. Culture changes with every passing day, very slowly. In 5000 years, who knows what will stay and what will arise? New religions will develop and some will fade into oblivion. But there will always be religion.

Does it not matter as much just because the two are currently at war with each other?<br>  <br>  Did you ever hear of something called the Bosnian Genocide?  Bosnian Muslims were "ethnically cleansed" by Serbs and Croats because they were Muslim, thus dirty and didn't deserve to have their land, thats why half of Bosnia is currently "claimed by Serbia and Croatia through the disgusting things they did to us, but the West still hasn't intervened and given us back our land, because we obviously couldn't do it ourselves do to the fact that 50 000 of our women were held in rape camps and 250 000 of our 2 million people were butchered.  What about the fact that they raped little baby girls or slaughtered babies infront of their mothers?  OR how about when they forced parents to eat the organs of their slowly dying kids?<br>  <br>  Oh no, Westerners never hear about that because they don't care.  And when we tried to tell them we were accused of being liars.  But mostly nobody wanted to hear us out and help us because we were Muslims, and Muslims with land (aka power) were bad news and by not helping them, the West was getting rid of the problem.  And some American idiots say "Clinton did a lot to help bla bla" but if thats the case, why did so many horrible things happen?  "Nobody's to blame"  BULL!<br>  <br>  So don't give me your little arrogant crap about Muslims being offended about the Holocaust.

Like my AP Calculus teacher; she understands the majority of the class is somewhat nature at math, thus knew that many do not know how to study it since the good grades came naturally as walking. So she taught us not only the subject itself, but how to study and remember it. Calculus is hard, but nobody feel frustrated or lost.<br>  Spanish teachers...the majority of them had never studied the Spanish course in school. Spanish came nature to them, which means they will not know how difficult it is when approaching some subjects like the difference between preterit and imperfect tense. never tried to learn basic spanish words, they have no idea how hard it is for students to remember words long term, especially when they will almost never see the words again once it is learned. There is a storage decay of long term memory that is going on in our brain, without stimulus being made short termly, the percentage of remembered words will drop sharply in first few days, then level off lower and lower towards almost nothing. It is true that there are spontaneous recoveries of old words, but the amount is so pathetically small that it is statistically insignificant. The teachers have no idea this is going on. So they assume the students know every words and expects them to do well because for the teachers, it is easy. <br>  Unprofessional spanish teachers are infesting schools everywhere; when constantly not getting good spanish teachers, spanish students will get really frustrated and give up and hate the spanish language all together|`|UWIVOidYaa	Any language is hard to learn when you're already hardwired a certain way. Most kids start learning when they're already over twelve. The prime introduction age is under five. It's very frustrating to be limited in a language. I'm sure most kids don't actually hate it-- they're just very frustrated with something they don't understand well.<br>  <br>  (Personal note: Let's face it. A few of the Spanish teachers at our school can be a little frustrating themselves, and many kids are just plain lazy.)|`|i1AsTUG0aa	becuase there are to many people that are racist against the hispanic people becuase of stereotypes and etc. It is ridiculous!

It might not sound like it makes sense, but take a spanish class and you will understand the english language much more.|`|tiKEy7uraa	I believe that, if the kids you mention speak English as their mother language, then Spanish is difficult for them to learn because it requires far more grammatical types to be used and used properly. Being a Greek learning English was piece of cake for me, but Spanish (which is a language a little less complicated than my mother language, but still with much grammar) required much more effort. And then Mediterranean people speak so much faster than English or Americans (and louder too Lol!) that to acquire a fluency you must practice a lot.|`|m4yvlk7Vaa	Well yeah spanish is usually really easy until you get into present perfect and pluperfect and all that stuff, it starts to get a little hard.

AA12290150	There is no evidence for the existence of vampires or fairies or angels or God. Your question should be "Can you assume something does exist if you have no proof." You can collect all evidence and if no convincing evidence exists, there is a strong likelihood that it does not exist. <br>  <br>  Evidence and proof. When it comes to believing or not believing an eye witness who claims to have seen a vampire, for example, there are three possibilies: i. she saw a real vampire, ii. she genuinely believes she saw a vampire but in fact she didn't (it was a man in the dark, for example), iii. she is lying.   <br>  <br>  For eye witness evidence to be accepted by a court of law it must usually be corroborated by other forms of physical evidence. The more the better.<br>  <br>  So far, there is no evidence for the beings you list in your question. There is no evidence for God either, but there are millions who believe. Just because millions believe something to be true, doesn't make it so.|`|FmazIF6Maa	You can't prove a negative. <br>  <br>  It just doesn't work that way, or anyone could claim anything exists and just say "prove it doesn't"... well, how do you prove flying marshmallows, giant man-eating dust bunnies, or dancing jelly beans don't exist? You can't prove they don't exist, but you can point to a lack of evidence or proof for their existance. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  When someone presents something that possibly exists, it requires some form of evidence to support it. Lack of evidence for something generally points to the likelyhood that the thing does not exist.|`|a86de0fc85e991d8d111b09367571df7aa	Soon there will be an nuclear explosion over a waste basket with a used tissue inside.<br>  The radiation will transform this used tissue into a sentient godzilla size tissue monster, which will overflow the seas with snot and destroy human civilization.<br>  <br>  You can't prove me wrong, you haven't seen it but you can't disprove it, there is no exact definition of 'soon', could mean soon for the time-range of a nebula.<br>  <br>  So by your logic this will happen, simply because it's impossible to disprove.<br>  Ever think about starting a church?|`|y3jD0DDpaa	their IS proof they DONT exist.<br>  <br>  LISTEN TO BEARCLAW|`|ffAwH6Seaa	quite simply it's called faith , a word that has become so closely associated with christianity that it is practically synonymous with it .

The higher levels of oxygen and lowered levels of carbon dioxide are part of a plant's "footprint". <br>  A vampire must drink blood in order to survive - ergo, his footprint will include either a higher rate of homicides in his local area, or a higher than normal rate of incidences of "anemia" among his "friends". Simply drinking blood does not make you a vampire - all it does is make you a human with a fetish for drinking blood. A real energy vampire would have a footprint that shows seriously low levels of energy, as represented by blood sugar levels, yet suddenly can function at normal levels despite having a blood sugar level usually associated with hypoglycemia. For instance, a "real" energy vampire could go without eating for a week or two, and then "drain" someone, and be restored to full vitality. Sorry, but that's not going to happen, and there is no one alive who can do that. The body uses energy from blood glucose, not some nebulous energy source the existence of which cannot be proven.<br>  A "genetic" vampire will have a footprint that shows up in any medical testing - without a doubt, every single "vampire" on here was born in a hospital, has been to a hospital, or will go to a hospital, clinic, lab, whatever - for bloodwork and/or genetic testing at least once in their lives. And guess what? They will be uniformly human.<br>  So if all self-professed "vampires" are existing in purely human, physical bodies, with completely human DNA, no different from anyone else, then how do they continue to hold on to this fantasy? Well, they say, I'm really a spiritual vampire, and I have "evolved" past the point of needing blood - I suck "auras" dry. Again, I refer back to my point about blood sugar. Let me tell you what will happen if I were to make a "psy vamp" fast for a week and then offer him a "meal" of aura and ask him to engage in any physically strenuous activity - he'll pass out, flat on his face, because his nebulous "energy" -prana, chi, the Force, whatever, only exists in his own fantasies.<br>  That is why these creatures do not exist, sure, I could claim I'm the fifth Cylon, and not one of you could prove me wrong - but when the time comes to put up or shut up there's no way I can prove I'm a Cylon at all, and many ways of proving that I'm human like all the rest of us.<br>  Blood in and of itself does not contain enough protein, fats, or carbohydrates at any given time to sustain a complex creature such as Homo Sapiens or any theorized offshoot mutations. Our digestive tract releases nutrients and glucose into our bloodstream at a measured rate - in order for a vampire to have any use at all out of blood he would need to drain every drop of blood the victim has - which he cannot do because the stomach is only about as large as your clenched fist, or a little larger. Again, the footprint: a "real" vampire would have a grossly distended abdomen, resembling a huge beer gut because his stomach would have to be the size of a basketball just to hold a third of the human blood supply, if that.|`|fAcVndo7aa	You can't.  People do because logical thinking is uncommon.  If it irritates you that someone doesn't believe in something you think is real (or possibly could be real), ask them about their religion...and then draw the parallels.  You cannot prove that God does or does not exist - yet they believe it (or disbelieve it, if they're an atheist), and you are supposed to accept it.  But they refuse to accept that you believe in fairies, despite the fact that they also cannot be proved to either exist or not exist.  It usually works.  Unless you're dealing with an agnostic.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	lol. people believe in "god". it's the same damn thing. XD

fAcVndo7aa	A pentagram is simply the five-pointed star; a pentacle is the five-pointed star with a circle surrounding it.  The two are sometimes used interchangeably, but that is the difference.  Also, the common perception is that the "pentagram" is the upside down star and "pentacle" is the upright one.  Technically, no matter which way the star faces, it is a pentagram - the upside down one is actually an inverted pentagram.|`|P0EAzyw8aa	the first style has 5 points with three at the top and two points at the bottom, used by many, the second is two pints at the top and three at the bottom this is refered to as an inverted star which is used by the darker methods. the pentacle stands for earth,air, fire, water and spirit.|`|FmazIF6Maa	No, it has nothing to do with the way it is pointing.<br>  <br>  A pentagram is a geometric shape (5 pointed star). <br>  <br>  A pentacle is what occult practitioners call something in the shape of, or inscribed with, a pentagram. Usually (but not always) it is enclosed within a circle. <br>  <br>  Which way it points depends on the religion/tradition.|`|tYqUutidaa	Actually they are one and the same. <br>  <br>  A pentagram or pentacle is a five-pointed star. Pentagrams were used symbolically in ancient Greece Ancient Greece. The Pentagram has associations, and many people who practice pagan faiths wear them. Christians once commonly used the pentagram to represent the five wounds of Jesus Christ, but nowadays some Christians associate the symbol with Satanism. However, most who use it are not Satanists. <br>  Some sources refer to the pentagram as the star of Solomon. The word pentagram comes from the Greek word e?í?ü??áìì?í (pentagrammon), a noun form of e?í?ü??áìì?ò (pentagrammos), e?í?Y??áìì?ò (pentegrammos) a word meaning roughly "five-lined" or "five lines".|`|dFBccLExaa	Close, but not quite. <br>  Pentacles and Pentagrams can be upside down or rightside up. The only difference is a pentacle has a circle around it, and a pentagram doesn't.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	that's right yo.|`|U8Fwh38jaa	A pentagram is not an upside down star.  Originally, both the pentacle and the pentagram were upright.  Satanists "borrowed" the symbol and turned it upside down to represent their path.  The only difference in looks between a pentacle and a pentagram is one has a circle around it and the other doesn't (again, in Wicca and other pagan religions, both are viewed upright). Both can be used in magical rituals.  Neither is a bad or "evil" symbol in and of itself.|`|BvY47ts6aa	Ok, upside-down or upright, it doesn't make a difference. But for the purpose of clarification, here's what my research have yielded:<br>  <br>  A pentagram (sometimes known as a pentalpha or pentangle or, more formally, as a star pentagon) is the shape of a five-pointed star drawn with five straight strokes.The word "pentacle" is sometimes used synonymously with "pentagram", and this usage is borne out by the Oxford English Dictionary, although that work specifies that a circumscription makes the shape more particularly a pentacle. Wiccans and Neo-pagans often make use of this more specific definition for a pentagram enclosed in a circle.<br>  <br>  So basically pentagram is a term used for the graphical representation of a five-pointed star, WITHOUT A RING drawn around it. Pentacle is a term which was originally synonymous with pentagram, but later on was the common term used by Wiccans and Neo-pagans as their symbol, WITH A RING drawn around it.|`|866c0414bd793093e0ef8a379814398faa	One wears a pentagram.  On an altar, one uses a pentacle.

The vast majority of Lesbians, Gay men, Bisexuals, and transgenders as well as transsexuals do not do any of this anyhow.

stAeoUeSaa	True Time vs. False Time<br>  <br>  Time is fractal in nature. It repeats itself in definite and regular patterns. That is why some prophecies can have double and even triple reference. You have probably heard the wise ole maxim: “history always repeats itself”. There’s more truth to that than you may know!<br>  <br>  False time ('Satanic Calendar') is the 13:20 ratio of the Tzolkin long count of 5,125 years broken down into 13 baktuns of 144,000 days each. This count only runs from right before the Great Flood til the 'abomination of desolation' (winter solstice 2012). It was given to the bloody Mayan pagans by Pacal Votan. Other parts of the world received it by meduimship, spirit conjuring, and divination like the Chinese I-ching for example.<br>  <br>  True Time is a dispensation of 7777 years that started back in 4762 BC. Joseph Scaliger came VERY close to this with his "Julian Period" in the 16th century. We add 4762 to negative BC dates to get thier True Time date and add 4761 (since there is no zero in our Gregorian calendar) to all AD dates. The 7777 years can be divided into 7 periods of 1111 years. 1111 whispers out in many ways to all ready for True Time understanding and no it is not a coincidence. It can also be broken down into 11 periods of 707 years. These are the 11 'weeks' of mankind's history referred to in the book of Enoch.<br>  <br>  The Tribulation will be from summer 6770pc - summer 6777pc (summer 2009AD - summer 2016AD). [pc = 'post creation']<br>  The midpoint of the Tribulation is December 21, 2012 (2012 is the Year of the Dragon)<br>  The most wise prophet Daniel showed us that we can also find the beginning if we just subtract 1260 days from that evil date and find the end if we just add 1260 days to it.<br>  <br>  The Millennial Age will be from 6777pc - 7777pc (2016AD-3016AD)<br>  <br>  The square root of 1111 has a VERY SPECIAL meaning as well!|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	The bigger question is why do ppl wish at all? Say something, then cross your fingers. Blow out candles on a birthday cake. Throw a penny in a fountain. <br>  <br>  It's just a superstition.

Any symbol they can find to give them 'power' or 'luck' they'll latch onto. <br>  <br>  11:11 & 2012 are in the mainstream now & more ppl are using them. They hold no more power or significance than any other superstition.|`|tYqUutidaa	I'm not a superstitious person. Well, I won't admit to being one anyway. Maybe it would be more accurate to say that I'm a mildly superstitious person. While I don't have to sit in a certain seat on an airplane to feel safe, or carry a rabbit's foot for luck (eeew!) I do abide by some other common rules. I'll sometimes touch or knock on wood for fear of jinxing myself. I'll toss a pinch of salt over my shoulder if I spill it. I try to never open an umbrella indoors if I can help it (why would you want to anyways?). I won't walk under ladders. And on those rare occasions when I break a mirror, I'm calculating the seven-year statute of limitations before I've even started picking up the glass. But none of these things are done with any degree of seriousness. For me it is more of a "it couldn't hurt to be safe" kind of feeling.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

bOiAHI8paa	yes, it does say it is bad to gamble.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Not a sin to gamble just not wise !! <br>  <br>  Answer: Gambling can be defined as “risking money in an attempt to multiply the money on something that is against the odds.” The Bible does not specifically condemn gambling, betting, or the lottery. The Bible does warn us, however, to stay away from the love of money (1 Timothy 6:10; Hebrews 13:5). Scripture also encourages us to stay away from attempts to "get rich quick" (Proverbs 13:11; 23:5; Ecclesiastes 5:10). Gambling most definitely is focused on the love of money and undeniably tempts people with the promise of quick and easy riches.<br>  <br>  What’s wrong with gambling? Gambling is a difficult issue because if it is done in moderation and only on occasion, it is a waste of money, but it is not necessarily "evil." People waste money on all sorts of activities. Gambling is no more or less of a waste of money than seeing a movie (in many cases), eating an unnecessarily expensive meal, or purchasing a worthless item. At the same time, the fact that money is wasted on other things does not justify gambling. Money should not be wasted. Excess money should be saved for future needs or given to the Lord's work - not gambled away.<br>  <br>  Gambling in the Bible: While the Bible does not explicitly mention gambling, it does mention games of "luck" or "chance." As an example, casting lots is used in Leviticus to choose between the sacrificial goat and the scapegoat. Joshua cast lots to determine the allotment of land to the various tribes. Nehemiah cast lots to determine who would live inside the walls of Jerusalem and who wouldn’t. The apostles cast lots to determine the replacement for Judas. Proverbs 16:33 says, “The lot is cast in the lap, but its every decision is from the Lord.” Nowhere in the Bible is gambling or "chance" used for entertainment or presented as an acceptable practice for followers of God.<br>  <br>  Casinos and lotteries: Casinos use all sorts of marketing schemes to entice gamblers to risk as much money as possible. They often offer inexpensive or even free alcohol, which encourages drunkenness, and thereby a decreased ability to make wise decisions. Everything in a casino is perfectly rigged for taking money in large sums and giving nothing in return, except for fleeting and empty pleasures. Lotteries attempt to portray themselves as a way to fund education and/or social programs. However, studies show that lottery participants are usually those who can least afford to be spending money on lottery tickets. The allure of "getting rich quick" is too great a temptation to resist for those who are desperate. The chances of winning are infinitesimal, which results in many peoples’ lives being ruined.|`|AA11690436	I'll lay you five to one odds that there's something against gambling in the bible.|`|JZxZ8mKRaa	Take a look at Isaiah 65:11 - The table for the god of Good Luck - what gambling depends on.<br>  <br>  1st Corinthians 6:10 says greed is not to be a part of a Christian's personality.<br>  <br>  1st Timothy 3:8 says we are not to be greedy of dishonest gain.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 4:28 says we are to work hard for what we have and even use our excess to help others.<br>  <br>  2nd Thessalonians 3:10-12 says we are to work for what we have and if we don't, we don't deserve to eat.

AA11043053	Tibetan Buddhism is actually one of the least popular forms of the religion.<br>  <br>  There are several versions of Buddhism. Those who state that Buddhism is just as much a philosophy as a religion are speaking more of the teachings of the Buddha without the supernatural mumbo-jumbo. (For example, accepting the improvement of life if one adopts an approach of non-attachment.)<br>  <br>  But since you're a Tibetan Buddhist, you're most likely right in there with the mumbo-jumbo, no different from Christians, Muslims, and Hindus.|`|FmazIF6Maa	I believe Buddhism is a religion... but there are some people who follow Buddhist philosophies without practicing it as a religion.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	I agree; Buddhism easily fits the definition of 'religion'.<br>  <br>  I think this is an atheist issue. I've seen many atheists here make the claim that Buddhism can't be a religion because it is non-theistic. That's absurd. They just have a knee-jerk reaction to the idea that one can simultaneously lack belief in gods and yet still be religious, probably because many theistic apologists attempt to associate atheism with religion.|`|43107832ee6f9105fc8637233731bbabaa	Religion (as opposed to spirituality, spiritual path) is a social activity and a social construct.  If people within a community act as though they are following a religion then the community is a religion (you can have religion regardless of whether the gods/idols/entities you worship exist or are even considered central).  If the people act as though they are trying to reform themselves in line with the instruction of a teacher then the community is more of a philosophical community.  The problem with the word 'philosophy' in a Western academic context is that it largely tied up with arguments about words with very little implication that the study should really impact on the life, ethics and behaviour of the people studying the philosophy (I am inclined to think that this is true of a lot of religion too - lip-service only).  So perhaps the words 'movement' or 'culture' are better - Buddhism is definitely about both inner movement and the culturing of a different way of being.<br>  <br>  I am inclined to think that the religious aspect of Tibetan Buddhism is a step on the path towards the freedom of Buddhism.  Nirvana isn't a place or a state of mind - it is very much about how to live life, but viewed from the perspective of an  enlightened mind, and thus a mind developed well beyond the limits of the usual and common place. Life from this perspective isn't a single period between a birth and a death, it is the whole thread of the mind-stream.  The historical Buddha was strongly opposed to speculation about things to which we had no direct access - humans should concentrate on what humans can gain evidence from, and Devas can learn from their world.<br>  <br>  So I'd say that much of Tibetan Buddhism is a religion but that this is intended to be a 'skillful means'.|`|bGUWUgUqaa	Can you support a good cause signing the following petition ?<br>  Falun Gong, Tibetans, other Buddhists, and Christians have been persecuted in China.

G4SVG7tKaa	There is a good, sound reason why they are called Bible STORIES. Archaeologically, geologically, and historically, the contents of the Bible have been proven to be nothing more than man-made stories inspired by the culture of the times. It sure as heck is NOT the "word of God." An omnipotent God would need to give his word just ONCE and all would subscribe to its accuracy and inerrancy just ONCE. Instead we have a weird compendium of fairy tales that have been re-interpreted so many times as to cause the massive division within Christendom. Now all the 1,500 plus factions claim exclusivity to "scriptural truth," and as practising "true Christianity." Absurd.<br>  <br>  Edit: I suggest that if you do your research in the Web, do not click on obviously biased CHRISTIAN websites. You will get nothing but lies doing that.

You and I and every witness here know that they claim to be Jehovah's only voice on earth. "Gods prophet" I will link the place where they claim this:<br>  <a href="http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/god_s..." rel="nofollow">http://www.quotes-watchtower.co.uk/god_s...</a><br>  <br>  Watchtower 1972 April 1 p.197 'They Shall Know that a Prophet Was Among Them'<br>  <br>  This "prophet" was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian Witnesses... Of course, it is easy to say that this group acts as a "prophet" of God. It is another thing to prove it. The only way that this can be done is to review the record.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Holy Spirit — The Force Behind the Coming New Order! (1976) p.148 ch.8 "Spirit of Life from God Entered into Them"<br>  <br>  The facts substantiate that the remnant of Christ's anointed disciples have been doing that prophesying to all the nations...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Watchtower 1952 April 15 p.253 Aids for Understanding Prophecy<br>  <br>  19 When may prophecies be understood? The Lord said to Daniel, "O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time of the end." (Dan. 12:4, AS) This indicates that the further fulfillment's of the prophecies are sealed until the physical facts appear that begin to fulfill them. So the rule seems to be reasonable and certain that prophecies cannot be understood until they are in the course of fulfillment or until they have been fulfilled. Jehovah as the great Interpreter makes known the meaning of his revelations in his due time, and speculation by men cannot bring to light the true meaning of prophecy before time. Jehovah has provided a channel, the "faithful and discreet slave" class, who are given spiritual "food at the proper time", and this spiritual food includes among other things the understandings of the prophecies in the course of their fulfillment's. (Matt. 24:45, NW) Jehovah's witnesses themselves are not nor can they be interpreters of prophecies. But as fast as the "superior authorities" Jehovah and Christ Jesus reveal the interpretations through their provided channel that fast do God's people publish them the world over to strengthen the faith of all lovers of righteousness.--------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Now we establish that they claim to be Jehovah's Prophet with their own literature-------------<br>  <br>  What does Jehovah say though?----<br>  <br>  One thing that is for certain is Deut: 18:22 “When the prophet speaks in the name of Jehovah and the word does not occur or come true, that is the word that Jehovah did not speak. With presumptuousness the prophet spoke it”. (NWT)<br>  <br>  Has the Watchtower ever been presumptuous?<br>  <br>  Now I will show where the Watchtower back-peddles on their false prophecies--------------------<br>  <br>  Reasoning From the Scriptures (1985, 1989) p.136 False Prophets<br>  <br>  Have not Jehovah's Witnesses made errors in their teachings?<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses do not claim to be inspired prophets. They have made mistakes. Like the apostles of Jesus Christ, they have at times had some wrong expectations.—Luke 19:11; Acts 1:6.<br>  <br>  Check out the link It is all Watchtower literature.<br>  <br>  There is no other religion on earth today that is more obviously a false prophet than the Witnesses and Jehovah says not to pay attention to them.<br>  <br>  This is the vision I get when I see them go back and forth like they do......Remember the Wizard of Oz?<br>  The great and powerful OZ was just a little fat man behind the drapes manipulating and creating this fearful God?

If it were really a novel I would have read it all.<br>  <br>  To answer you, Paul said that, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God", so none of us are truly righteous.  No matter how good we think we are, our best efforts are like filthy rags to Him.  That is why we approach our Creator on the basis of Jesus Precious Name.  Jesus is our Mediator and has paved the way for all humanity to be able to approach Him in prayer.  Yes, approach JESUS in prayer.  John 14:14 says, "If YOU ask anything in my name, I will do it."|`|AT4idiuPaa	Do you think god prefers horrible people who believe in him or good people who do not?<br>  Or horrible people who try and keep his laws as opposed to good people who try and life good lives in harmony with nature and their fellow man?<br>  Is book learning so important?

Anyone who puts their trust in him is freely saved.<br>  <br>  John 6:28-29: Then they asked him, “What must we do to do the works God requires?” Jesus answered, “The work of God is this: to believe in the one he has sent.”<br>  <br>  John 3:14-18: Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the desert, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life. For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe stands condemned already because he has not believed in the name of God's one and only Son.<br>  <br>  <br>  John 6:40: For my Father's will is that everyone who looks to the Son and believes in him shall have eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>  <br>  <br>  John 20:30-31: Jesus did many other miraculous signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name.<br>  <br>  <br>  Acts 10:43: All the prophets testify about him that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name.<br>  <br>  <br>  Acts 16:30-31: He then brought them out and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” They replied, “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your household.” <br>  <br>  <br>  Romans 3:21-25: But now a righteousness from God, apart from law, has been made known, to which the Law and the Prophets testify. This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe. There is no difference, for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through faith in his blood.<br>  <br>  <br>  Romans 4:4-5: Now when a man works, his wages are not credited to him as a gift, but as an obligation. However, to the man who does not work but trusts God who justifies the wicked, his faith is credited as righteousness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Romans 10:9-13: That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved. As the Scripture says, “Anyone who trusts in him will never be put to shame.” For there is no difference between Jew and Gentile—the same Lord is Lord of all and richly blesses all who call on him, for, “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.”<br>  <br>  <br>  Ephesians 2:8-9: For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast.<br>  <br>  <br>  Galatians 5:4: You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace.<br>  <br>  <br>  Galatians 3:21-22: For if a law had been given that could impart life, then righteousness would certainly have come by the law. But the Scripture declares that the whole world is a prisoner of sin, so that what was promised, being given through faith in Jesus Christ, might be given to those who believe.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	“God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”—1?Cor. 10:13.<br>  Jehovah wants his people to be happy. He takes no pleasure in seeing his people suffer. But he does make even those enduring hardship happy because they have the opportunity now to make an everlasting record of integrity to the Universal Sovereign Jehovah God.<br>  Paul’s description of mankind’s bad conduct in the “last days” indicated what a strong influence for wrongdoing would be present in the earth. Therefore, Christians must continually be very careful and constantly rely upon Jehovah to help them in time of temptation. At 1?Corinthians chapter 10 Paul outlined some of the temptations to which the early servants of Jehovah were subjected, such as idolatry or fornication, and then said: “Consequently let him that thinks he is standing beware that he does not fall. No temptation has taken you except what is common to men. But God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear, but along with the temptation he will also make the way out in order for you to be able to endure it.”—1?Cor. 10:12, 13.<br>  <br>  * Something Phoney about all the Positive points Given by Jehovah's Witnesses.. and all thumbs Down.

Maybe you are inwardly rebelling against the Pharisaical religion of the watchtower. The good news is that Jesus came so that you could be saved by believing in Him.<br>  <br>  Luk 5:32 I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.<br>  <br>  You can never do enough or be good enough to earn everlasting life. <br>  Throw off the constraints of organized religion and get on your knees to Jesus and He will give you rest.

And exactly how do Jehovah's witnesses come unto Him?|`|AA11703455	You might not consider yourself "righteous", but your attitude reflects that you have a conscience and a care about what you do. So, I would say that Jehovah does hear your prayers.<br>  <br>  He rejects the prayers of hypo-critics, those that make a show of their "righteousness". <br>  <br>  You need though to draw closer to Jehovah. As James said at 4:8 is that when you draw close to Him, God draws closer to you.

Perfection is a hard standard to live up to. Your belief is soo deeply ingrained that ea time you do something imperfect you feel a physical symptom. God is not a taskmaster who commands ppl to be perfect & do no wrong. <br>  <br>  He is there for you to call on. If He only listened when you were perfect, how could He hear you at all? Yes, your dad made a full recovery, but what if he hadn't? There are plenty of ppl who are prayed for daily who suffer & die despite prayers. Your partying or do-gooding have nothing to do with the health of others. However, less partying & smoking will be healthier for you<br>  <br>  Your religion & close friends will frown upon it, but it would do you good to examine some other faiths. Having a different perspective can improve your relationship to God. You are NOT unworthy, despite what the literature says (that u don't deserve God's ear). It's commendable that you are concerned about your actions, but you are being very hard on yourself. <br>  <br>  God created you to be who you are & knows your heart. An all-knowing, ever-present, all-powerful being can do far more than you give Him credit for. Examine your beliefs of what you feel/think about God & what the watchtower proclaims. Look at the religions that are inline w/your beliefs & what they have to say.  <br>  <br>  God accepts us just as we are without our having to 'try'. Above all, keep praying. I hope that you will soon know the truth..for it will set you free.|`|yrJQHOOeaa	If you believe Jehovah is real and he hears you... then  he is real and he hears you. I do not share this belief, so for me he doesn't exist. Your mind makes your reality. I do have compassion for you in regards to trying to be more righteous. However, I would suggest not taking what leaders of your church say too seriously. If you believe you are heard whether you are righteous or not, then you will be heard. Your belief is all that matters.

AA11232725	Mark 10:1  Then He arose from there and came to the region of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And multitudes gathered to Him again, and as He was accustomed, He taught them again...17  Now as He was going out on the road, one came running, knelt before Him, and asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"<br>  <br>  A Jewish man had heard of Jesus and he came to Him wanting to know what he had to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus could tell that the man's wealth was an idol in his life and so He told him that in order to follow Him he would have to sell his possessions and give the money to the poor first. The man was sad because he didn't want to give up his earthly security for a Heavenly promise. Jesus pointed out that people who trusted in their wealth instead of Him would have a difficult time entering into the Kingdom of Heaven.|`|AA10057370	Trust in God not self or wealth.<br>  <br>  pray and read|`|AA11043053	Mark was the earliest written Gospel still existing.

This passage should be read in the light of that theme, which runs throughout the book.|`|z6T7nznLaa	You need to look at the context of the scripture, not just the verses you were given.  If you look at Mark 10:1, it says this:<br>  "Jesus then left that place and went into the region of Judea and across the Jordan."  <br>  What was happening?<br>  Jesus was furthering his ministry by reaching out to his children.  If you look ahead, the beginning of chapter 11 gives the account of the triumphal entry of Christ into Jerusalem.  So he is nearing his crucifixion.  What follows is the Last Supper, his death, and his resurrection.|`|2sHSXNQoaa	The man ( whoever he is) feel at Jesus feet and said what must I do to  have eternal life (heaven).

What you need to do is look at Mark 10: 13-16. It is a pretty famous story Jesus shuns the disciples for shunning the children. What you must understand is that during that time, 6 out of 10 children would not live to be 16. So people had MANY children in hopes that one or two of their children would survive. Those children are completely dependent on their parents. It was not possible for them to take care of themselves. What Jesus is saying when he says "I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it." He is saying we can't be dependent on ourselves, we have to be completely dependent on God, We can't enter the kingdom of heaven in till we hand all of our life into his hands. So after that's all said and done, this dude (The rich Young Man) walks up to him and says "Jesus what must I do to enter heaven" (Note I am paraphrasing here), quick side note that you must understand. The Jews during that time period believed that if you were a rich Jew, and life was going good for you, God was blessing you, that you were okay and better with God. And if Bad things befell you, then you did something wrong and deserved it. Look at how they treated Job when the stuff befell him. This Rich Young Man had it made in life, he had earned his way up those ranks, he was completely dependent on himself to get what he needed done. He didn't need anyone's help. When Jesus was saying sell all your stuff give it away and joins me. He wanted that man to get rid of all the things that he had created and walk amongst Jesus, with nothing, because then, he would have nothing but his sandals and some clothes, and he would completely dependent on God. But for the Rich that is hard, for one to give away your whole life and become dependent on God and no one else. This section is not telling you to sell everything and wander around a Homeless man. It's saying you need to stop depending on yourself, and depend on God. I hope that his helped you. God bless.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The man wanted to know what he could do to be saved.  We are not saved by DOING.  We are only saved by BELIEVING in Jesus.  <br>  <br>  Jesus gave him the law.  Jesus showed him that he wasn't keeping the law.  Nobody but Jesus can keep the law.  <br>  <br>  It is impossible for man to save himself.  It is only possible for God to save us, and Jesus is God.  <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|dq0L2jsAaa	Dear friend,<br>  <br>  like that rich young man, we do want to follow CHRIST and enjoy the fruits but are unwilling to sacrifice our wordly pleasures. Pleasures that can be bought by money. We do not want to obey or follow HIS commands and at the same time want to be HIS disciple.JESUS says that is not possible.As HE said in Mt 6:24 -  <br>  "No one can serve two masters. Either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and Money. "<br>  <br>  Our faith should follow action as well, as Saint  James exhorts us...<br>  James 2 : 14What good is it, my brothers, if a man claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such faith save him? 15Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. 16If one of you says to him, "Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed," but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? 17In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead. 18But someone will say, "You have faith; I have deeds." <br>  Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by what I do. 19You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder. ...<br>  <br>  So, for salvation, lip servicing alone won't do, we need to serve at HIS altar with all the blessings that our LORD has blessed us with...<br>  Rom. 12: 6We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it in proportion to his faith. 7If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; 8if it is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, Thanks.|`|hAXDWhiVaa	read the bible sweetie.

Dde4ZnmYaa	There are a lot of people who believe in God, and plenty who don't. Some are happy with their lives and some aren't. As far as I can see there is no correlation between a persons level of happiness and their religious beliefs. <br>  <br>  If a single true god improved all his believers lives, and punished others, why would other faiths exist? Why would atheists refuse all faiths? Wouldn't that be intentionally masochistic?<br>  <br>  If a single true god improved his believers lives, why would people of all faith continue to strunggle with the question "why do bad things happen to good people?"<br>  <br>  The only possible answers I can see is that either god punishes the faithful and the unfaithful indiscriminately. Or that there is no higher power doling out punishments, and that your level of happiness is determined by your own actions, the actions of those around you, and imperfect biology. <br>  <br>  Religion won't offer you a cure for your suffering, it will only offer a you a reason why you suffer. These are usually along the lines of  "God is punishing you for doing wrong" or "God is testing your faith" Personally I've found neither of these explanations particularly consoling. (and they don't help solve the problem)<br>  <br>  If god "punishes those who do wrong", why do we need a legal system to keep law and order?<br>  <br>  If pain is the result of "God testing your faith" why does he punish atheists which have no faith to test.<br>  <br>  Being told you suffer because "God works in mysterious ways" won't put an end to your suffering, it only attempts to put an end to your questioning.<br>  <br>  If you're suffering, locate the cause of your suffering and try to fix it. If your body is experiencing great pain, see a doctor (Any responsible religious person should tell you the same thing.)<br>  <br>  If your mind is experiencing pain see a psychiatrist. If the mental distress stems from a particular event you can work on dealing with it. If it's a biochemical problem they may put you on medication.<br>  <br>  Buddha may have been right, "Life is suffering", but life can also be fun and joy and love. There will always be a few things beyond your control which determine how much of those things you get (whether you believe in god or you don't)<br>  <br>  But there are plenty of things you can control to make yourself happier.  Go out there and find some of them.|`|NNvcd5Bhaa	I've got a news flash for you. Even strong christians suffer, a lot. So God has nothing to do with that. But keep in mind, in my belief, the further you are from God, the less he can help you. <br>  <br>  Yes, life can be painful. I am very ill right now. But I am also a christian. You must also remember though, without struggle, there can be no growth. Just like heavy weights that are difficult to lift make your muscles grow, so do lifes difficult situations make us to grow within. We grow not only in knowledge, but also in character, wisdom, and emotional strength.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and may God lead you to find truth and healing.|`|J0GE7Wiraa	Life is full of much suffering. The Buddha teaches us a way to end all suffering, and to be happy in your everyday life in Samsara. Not only that, but the biggest advantage of Buddhism is that it can help us to end Samsara altogether, and attain the eternal joy and peace of Nirvana.|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	First things First. God doesn't make you suffer if your suffering it's because of your own ignorance. No offense, really I'm not a very religious person, but I don't think it is fair to say god is making you suffer, the truth is he's letting you suffer. It might seem weird but I study all kinds of religion, and in the story of Jonas and the whale. he was ignorant and running away from trouble because he didn't want to suffer and face the people God was asking him to save. It is only in times of suffering and trouble that people truly realize who Gos is and Where he is for them. So God sent trouble, he sent the whale to swallow him up so he and Jonas could have a heart to heart. Life doesn't mean suffering in fact it means living. Suffering makes us stronger if we can get though it ( and most believe god is the one who helps them through it) and once the suffering end we are able to live more efficiently. If you want fact them here it is in plain cold truth. Get over it if there isn't a god then you just need a councilor and if there is ask him for help .|`|U1hGMckKaa	what's going on here is you have made a great discovery. you are on your way to happiness. religion can no longer get in the way of your daily life. what you are sufering from is you are not doing anything with your life or you are making mistakes. you have to think clearly. it's going to take me alot of time to explain it to you so mabe just a little at a time.|`|09mW6AU2aa	No, it doesn't.<br>  <br>  Watch out though, man.

Be a good person and that's all you'll ever need.<br>  <br>  "Life means suffering... life itself is suffering"  Well, ok, that can be true, but only if you look at it that way.  I view life as something that is different to each individual.  If you believe life is filled with suffering, then you will suffer.  If you see life as a series of ups and downs, then you'll learn to appreciate your meager existence.<br>  <br>  This is it, kiddo, this is your only chance.  You're either satisfied and happy with it, or you die a sad wretch.<br>  <br>  It's your choice.<br>  <br>  Grow up, there's no god.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That being said, I hope you will become a happier person in the future and that you will die with a smile.<br>  <br>  But that's your decision.|`|wRsSodTAaa	Life is hard for all, but when you are a Christian, you have a friend that sticks even closer than a brother to help you...

I could be dying of thirst, but if I refused to drink the water that was being freely offered to me, I would suffer and even die.  The same applies to Jesus.  He offers the gift, but never forces you to take it.  <br>  "Is any among you suffering? Let him pray."

Really, your life is only the sum of your situations and what you decided to do and feel about them. I suggest you keep an upbeat attitude even if you have to do it through gritted teeth. I guarantee that somewhere in the world, somebody has it worse than you. I also guarantee that somewhere in the world is a person who you could teach a thing or two about living their best life. So, don't give up. We're all in this together and we need you here living and learning with us.  <br>  <br>  I don't mean that glibly. My life could change on a dime and has before. So might yours. Good luck.|`|4DqtcnEmaa	The Buddha was at the cross in fulfillment of the Melchezidek appearance at Jerusalem before Abraham and Isaac suffering for the Faith and the Love of God and of people where He will save His many sheep from various folds from their sins for He has many crowns as written.<br>  <br>  I and The Father are One.

Philosophy deals with logic. Where people get the idea that they have to stop thinking logically to believe in God is beyond me.<br>  <br>  I don't want to sound like a unloving Christian, but sometimes tough love works; so allow me to say this. Before you take that permanent dirt nap you better logically figure this out. Yes I know your not dying but consider other sources of material to check out before you give up on a possibility that maybe just maybe God exist. I can give you many sources but let's start with one just for now; read The Case for the Real Jesus by Lee Strobel, former atheist, a journalism degree from the University of Missouri and a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale Law School and was the award winning legal editor of the Chicago Tribune.

I too have a painful illness and my life has changed over the years because of it.<br>  <br>  At one time I believed in god and thought he was allowing me to go through ****,, so as to show me something or for me to come to him.   That is what christians will say.  that god is seeking your heart,  knocking on your door so to speak.  <br>  <br>  My friend.   Christians,  Buddhists,  Hindus,   Muslims...agnostics.  athiests  ..etc..... they get sick,  we all are succeptable to physical illness and sometime mental too.   Gods or not has not a jot to do with it.<br>  It will only make things worse thinking that there is some god punishing you on purpose.   What a burden for us to bear if we all believed such a horrible concept.   So please put that out of your mind.  <br>  We get sick because of environmental,  or biophysical,  reasons,  or maybe not taking care of our health in the best way,  perhaps genetics,  hereditary reasons,   there is a perfectly logical and scientific reason for why you are not feeling well.   No invisible being is the cause of it.<br>  <br>  I believe that there can be a correlation between mental wellbeing and physical.   I found that since receiving therapy and on anti depressants,  I have less pain and have a better outlook on life.<br>  <br>  I would say for you to see your doctor,  tell him about the depressive feelings you are having.<br>  <br>  A physical painful illness can be a reason for depression,  they often go hand in hand. <br>  <br>  I hope and believe it is possible for you to get well.   Look inside yourself and find answers.   Do what you can to make healthy choices for living,  do research on the conditions that you have.  You will be lead to find healing ways to help you feel better.<br>  <br>  For instance just recently I just started having massages.  They feel amazing,  help me to relax and relieve pain and improve mood.<br>  <br>  I wish you well.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Lain H.  (answer below mine)<br>  Fantastic answer.  I love what you said.

Many of them still live in poverty and are unable to provide for their families on the work that they do. Their indigenous ways are in danger of disappearing as more and more of these artisans and their children and being encouraged to leave their rural areas for the capital city of Asuncion, where many of them end up in the slums washing clothes, selling gum or begging on corners to survive. When you become a sponsor, you are giving a child an education and basic health care that would otherwise be unattainable to him or her. Through education, your child will be given opportunities to better himself or herself in ways that they had never imagined. And by bettering themselves, they will be bettering their families and their communities. Your sponsorship will insure that these children and their families will live with dignity in their communities, constantly growing and bettering themselves as a whole. By obtaining life skills that will make them self-sufficient, or by learning basic mathematics, reading and writing, these children will then be able to go to their families and aid them in selling their pottery, clothing, or other works.

eO2rnf7yaa	Determinism is much more likely to be the belief of atheists than of people who believe in God.   It is Christians like me who are the staunchest defenders of the existence of free will.<br>  <br>  I think it is interesting that a great many people find God while incarcerated in prisons,  which would suggest that being controlled by others might lead people to turn to God for true freedom.   The practice of religion requires political freedom.  This is one of the reasons that the Catholic Church is staunchly against communism and other totalitarian governments.<br>  <br>  You asked several questions.  Freedom from the control of other people is very different from the control of nature.   Generally, we are all subject to nature.  We can build shelter from the weather, and build boats and bridges to cross rivers, but nature is only minimally and intermittently under our control or avoidable.<br>  <br>  Every known society that lives with only minimal material development has a robust religious life.  "Primitive" societies typically have rich faith lives.   More developed societies often have less active religious practices.  I think the highly developed countries have things so easy that it is often possible to forget that humans are not absolutely in control of much.   Societies that are closely engaged with nature are generally much more humble about their abilities.   I think they are more realistic about God than a lot of materially well-off societies.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|oBXiigEoaa	Not in the US.

No. Not all faiths, anyway. In my faith we are very much in control of ourselves and our destinies. If we were not, how could we be expected to be responsible for our own behavior? Taking responsibility for ourselves is a major thing in my faith. There is no forgiveness in my faith. Compassion, yes. Forgiveness, no. Self Sufficiency (one of the NNV) comes with a great sense of freedom, but also a lot of responsibility. It's something we're all aware of and deal with in our lives on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  So, there  is at least one faith out there that is full of people who *know* they have  control over what happens to us and still manage  to stay strong in our faith.<br>  <br>  But I think you hit the nail on the head with some of the other faiths, to be quite honest with you...

AA12350023	Islam allows your intended spouse to view you before marriage and even time to get to know you.. I dont believe in blind marriages.. <br>  You can sit with your intended and talk about issues that might face you in marriage..<br>  <br>  and to the person above who thinks all muslim men marry more than one women.. that obviously shows ignorance and lack of knowledge about islam.. I would be embarrassed to post up ignorant info that you know nothing about.. islam does allow UPTO 4, but doesnt say you have to.. and God says if you cannot be equal and fair (and certainly no man can) then only marry one. So God knows mens intent.. And why do other people dog on Islam about allowing more than one legal wife. when majority of the westerns all go out and have affairs with mutiple partners.. but they act like marrying mroe than one is awful..

I was unconscious when I slid into the 2nd tree but it was successful in breaking a few ribs.<br>  <br>  The only reason I consider this a near death experience is that if I had hit the first tree head first it would have certainly smashed my head open.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	I woke up in a dimly lit cave next to a large wolf, easily my size or slightly larger, whom I immediately recognized as Fenris Wolf from Norse Mythology.<br>  <br>  I placed my right hand on his left shoulder, and he wrapped his left paw around my arm and put his pads on my right shoulder, returning the gesture.<br>  <br>  Nothing was said, nothing needed to be said.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's nothing more than a neat little hallucination brought on by severe trauma, but it's a neat experience even knowing it was all in my head.|`|wG825TwBaa	I almost died in thailand from a virus.  i went into a coma for several days.   a few years before that i almost died from a very strange form of meningitis.  my doctor said he had never heard of anything like it.       those were pretty crazy.   strange thing is during my meningitis battle i lost all my faith and thats when i started to become atheist.     I felt so content with life and with death and i never once felt like i had a reason to hold on to my beliefs.   I still and have always felt this way.   during my thailand incident i was going in and out of consciousness the whole way to the hospital and once i got to the hospital i was only conscious twice for less than a min,  but even then i never felt or dreamed of anything that would lead me to a religion.|`|84gK4XlHaa	I was hit by a drunk driver while I was in a cross walk.  Thankfully, no serious injuries.  Just a lot of bruising and scratches.  Scared the scheiss out of me.|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I have had only one in living memory and lots as a baby. The one i remember was like something I will never forget. I was in a pool, at the time I was a terrible swimmer and I also had a huge fear of water. I fell into the deep part of the pool. I desperately struggled to stay afloat but my efforts were fruitless I continued to sink when all that desperation that comes from lack of breathing went away. I stopped shaking like a fish out of water and instead calmy sunk to the bottom. Then I opened my eyes and from the bottom I saw the light and in my mind I heard a voice and it said 'don't give up, fight, fight to stay alive' i then out of nowhere got strength and managed to push myself back up.<br>  <br>  I got out, nothing serious but I was shaking a lot|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Ah, J.P. you got to see Fenrir, aka Hróevitnir! You're so lucky! <br>  <br>  When I was in my motorcycle accident (some punk in Mommy and Daddy's SUV tried to pass me and clipped my front tire) I had to be airlifted out. All I saw was a really bright light and felt like I was floating. I also heard muffled voices. The bright light turned out to be the big lights above my bed. The floating sensation was whatever drug they had given me to keep me from attempting to kill anyone who tried to touch me (I don't remember that part). The muffled voices - well, that was a couple of my friends who had lied about how they were related to me so they could come into the room with me, whispering about my condition. It sounded muffled because I had one hell of a concussion.  <br>  <br>  My helmet saved my life, I'm sure.   <br>  <br>  If I had any other kind of near death experience (I was out for a long time, apparently) I certainly don't remember it.<br>  <br>  Not sure I want a repeat of that experience, either. As a matter of fact, next time I just want to die on the scene. That crap kinda hurt...|`|AA12186845	I was really sick and felt I was dying.

AA11043053	Neither.<br>  <br>  Suicide is most often considered when people feel they have no other options available. This is frequently a case of failed or impaired creativity and consultation with others.<br>  <br>  Suicide frequently arises out of mental illness, and as such can be considered a symptom of the disease. What is required is effective treatment, not permission to off oneself.<br>  <br>  If, however, someone has an untreatable physical illness that will lead to a painful death in the near future, and consultation with physicians concur on this, then I believe that doctors assisting in the death of such a person is justifiable.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	It's a sin according to the Bible, which is a work of fiction. It's a right when someone is suffering from a terminal illness. I think anything else needs the proper care and treatment.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	A right.

I believe that in the eyes of the law, physician-assisted suicide should be a right regardless of others' moral or ethical views of it. And not only for physical illnesses. What about those who are chronically depressed and can't find a medication or combination of meds that works for them? Who are we to say they must go on suffering or take a chance on a botched suicide and subsequently suffer even more?|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	What do you mean by a right? Humans have the freedom to choose right from wrong. So in that case, suicide is definitely a right because people have the freedom to choose.<br>  <br>  But that does not mean that the choice is a positive one. <br>  <br>  Suicide is definitely a sin... but as human beings we have free will to choose right from wrong and God gives us that freedom.|`|AA12262567	Supposely it's a sin in Christianity, but I don't know how other religions view it as, but probably not in a good way.

Suicide is the unfortunate result of a broken mind.  Thanks for asking.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well, that's tough.<br>  <br>  I've known four, maybe five people who killed themselves. Some I just heard about later, hadn't seen them for a long time. One was a friend of mine I saw in class every day.<br>  <br>  I'd say it is a sin, for the same reason that the Death Penalty is wrong. When you kill someone you cut short their spiritual development. You might very well be sending someone to Hell that, if they were to continue on their spiritual journey just a little longer, could have been  saved. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a person has to hit bottom before they are willing to do what it takes to be saved. To get salvation we have to genuinely repent of our sins. Not just "Dear God  I'm sorry you get upset when I do that, but it sure was fun and I promise I'll kind of sort of try not to do it again for a while."  Neither does "Dear God, I am so sorry I got caught and got in trouble. Please don't  punish me."  No to get salvation you have to genuinely say "Dear God... I really wish I hadn't ever done that. It was wrong."   That's hard. In many cases a person has to really "hit bottom" to reach that sort of repentance and really genuinely open up to God.<br>  <br>  If someone gets into trouble, and they kill themselves, they avoid a lot of pain. They also avoid any growth that may come from that pain. They may well be avoiding the very experience they need to endure in order to be genuinely saved. <br>  <br>  That being said...I don't think that most suicides are totally mentally stable when they kill themselves. Deep depression can mess with ones head in bad ways. I wouldn't be willing to say that all suicides go to Hell because I think God will probably say that most of them are "not guilty by reason of insanity".

When that happens to me, I MAKE A SCENE.  Starting with "HOW DARE YOU!"  and running the gamut of demanding apologies, to telling however does so dare, to GET F*CKED.  Very loud.  Very very loud.

OLZYHo17aa	there's nothing wrong with it. the reason some people are upset about it is because it's different from what they're used to. they've grown up seeing hetero after hetero. they aren't cultured, and they need to grow up. there have been studies shown that it's in your genes. nothing is wrong with gay/les/bi. taking the 'different is bad' approach is a horrible way to go about life.|`|47TSqkEGaa	I wouldn't know about how it is to be swinging another way, but I think that it is kinda nasty. But that doesn't mean I don't respect gay people lol. I actually support gay rights. as far as marriage. But I accept people for who they are, even if it doesn't exactly go with my religion. You can't help how you feel.|`|vhiYsLjXaa	Nothing is wrong with being gay/lesbian/bisexual. People just find it "gross" because they are scared because they don't understand it. People are scared of "different" things. Don't worry about it, your friend is probably (no offense) narrow minded and right winged!|`|XVVl7rycaa	so was shocked, when i told my best friend  i was bi, and he was ok with it, he said "i am who i am" is something i never thought he'd say since those are my words of wisdom|`|UURuejLtaa	maybe you don't understand her, but some just do because they are straight and cannot imagine themselves being one or weren't expecting you were one... surprise|`|7vgTHpKwaa	Nothing at all I've had several gay friends suprise me too I never over reacted but if there a real friend she will *** back give it time ps(now that I think about it over half my friends ary gay and bi) lol|`|WeR0E56eaa	nothing is wrong about it<br>  <br>  she is just not as open-minded|`|5vbrHrzvaa	nothing really (unless your really religious) <br>  its just kinda akward|`|AA11732071	there is nothing wrong with it at all. the problem lies in your intolerant friend|`|NnbR5Bauaa	I dont think it is, she must not be a very good friend, if i was ur friend that wouldnt matter to me because your still the same person.

Maybe they're not used to the idea that there are people different from them.<br>  <br>  Or, they think it is wrong because some people think we have to have sex and make babies. That we are not made by "God" to like the same gender. To not make babies.<br>  <br>  Some people just think it's wrong because a lot of other people think it's wrong. Some just have closed minds. Maybe they are brought up to think that being gay/lesbian/bisexual is wrong.<br>  <br>  But for your friend, I think she was surprised and a bit sad that you didn't tell her before. If my friend didn't tell me until quite a while, I think I'd be surprised as well.|`|2eztcCO0aa	Nothing is bad about it.  But it's not something that a lot of straight people can understand.  The world is full of people who just can't see beyond their own experience; they can't imagine being attracted to someone of the same sex and so they assume that someone who can must have something wrong with them.  Pity these people, and hang out with people who are capable of a larger view.|`|sTbUR32haa	Nothing is bad about it. Some people are a bit homophobic because they are not used to it or they are religious, but most of the time they are used of seeing heterosexual people.|`|gYmQSIaZaa	there is nothing gross or bad about being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. its perfectly fine.|`|uTuwAmNXaa	theres absolutely nothing wrong with it<br>  i wouldnt be freaked out, but other people might just need some time to adjust to it, idk why, but theres nothing wrong with it|`|cSaVqUDdaa	Nothing at all hunn.. shes just 1 scared of what i dunno. probably that her friend who she thought that was str8 is not. Or shes narrow minded.|`|3XLnDyupaa	Nothing is bad about it.|`|TiunEkVVaa	well...it isnt really natural...she might think u like her or something...
SP06HFMWaa	The Quran and the old testament are very very similiar from what I have read of them.I think it is important to note that Jesus whole message was called the New testament, that we really don't need the <br>  old testament. I admit that I don't know if the Quran includes the New Testament or not and I am not really familiar with the teachings of the prophet Mohammad. Getting back to Jesus personally, I believe the scribes of his time wrote about his ministry and the part of his life that covered that time period. His childhood and early years were not as important as the transformation that he experienced<br>  from Jesus the man to Jesus the Christ.I believe this occurred at about age 28, When he began his referring to the" I Am"<br>  the way..etc. I think that is when he made the connection to the God within and his consciousness was transformed to that of the Father within.I believe that the Roman Catholic Church added the mystical born of a virgin and Son of God mystery. He probably was not all that well known until he began his healing work. I have read that Mary Magdalen was probably his closest disciple and <br>  they might well have had a relationship together.Who can say? The church had it's own agenda and that revolved around controlling the masses of people and that also worked to the favor of rulers who by swearing allegiance to the holy roman empire could keep people basically impoverished and under their thumb. As for Jesus it has been said that he spent his early years in Egypt, being schooled there,<br>  some say he studied in India or the East,I think that he more than likely was schooled with a group of Essenes who helped him establish his contact with his inner Source.You have to remember that he brought forth a new teaching that replaced the belief of the Old Testament in an eye for an eye, He taught that only one testament was needed that if we loved one another as we would be loved, the others would not even need to be a consideration in the consciousness of mankind. The Essenes were the keepers of a higher form of truth or  teaching than the church or synagogues of the day.<br>  His only fit of anger that comes to mind was directed at the money changers at the Temple where people worshiped. Money changing or Tithing I believe is the same,I don't believe that giving money to churches or institutions, so they can live on it and build grand buildings to worship in, had any place in the worship of God as Jesus knew it to be - and tried his best to convey to us ,to not worship him but the one who sent him,he doeth the works.I believe that Jesus  tried to teach us to worship only at the real temple of God and that we will find within.our own being or consciousness.|`|mGTjFgCwaa	He went totally ape-****.<br>  <br>  He didn't know how to deal with the revelation of his supposed divinity. Eventually he got a hold of himself and then resurfaced as the Messiah in the Bible and Quran (2 historical books). Nobody wants to see a Prophet with human qualities, especially the Son of God, so no one in their right mind hoping to preach to the masses is going to tell about anything less than 100% perfection, water-to-wine, death-defying holiness.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Well i think He lived His life as a carpenters son would have. But always remember that the Bible tells us He was w/o sin and perfect in all of His ways. He did not marry. Many forget that while Jesus was/is indisputably the Son of God and the Messiah He was also human. He faced all of the challenges we face and yet He was w/o sin.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) The Bible and Quran; Similar Message; What happened to Jesus during those years that are not written about?<br>  <br>  We don't know.  Why?  **Because it wasn't written about!**<br>  <br>  <br>  Another mind-bending question solved by Captain Obvious!|`|oBXiigEoaa	The similarities between the holy books is easily explained by a little bit of historical research. Jews, Christians, and Arabs did a lot of trade together and lived in close proximity. Muhammad pieced together Islam by taking some bits from Judaism and Christianity.<br>  <br>  Some books of the Bible were excluded from being canonized. I am not a Bible scholar, but I believe that one or two of the excluded books goes more into detail on Jesus' personal life.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	It is not mystery. Jesus lived like any other person with his parents, in strict obedience. He had an assigned time to start his mission and until then, he was with his parents serving and obeying them. When his time came, he fasted, got baptized and started his mission.|`|7J1D1IyRaa	It's because in those years, Jesus didn't do anything significant and unlike Krishna (who even as a child was very unusual)  did not catch anybody's attention. [If one considers Jesus as God, that's hard to explain]. <br>  <br>  The Muslim view of Jesus is very different from that of Christianity. In Christianity, Jesus is divine. In Islam, Jesus is a prophet/representative of God. In Christianity, Jesus died for our sins. In Islam, Jesus was never crucified and nobody can ever die for someone else's sins, anyway.|`|oVHFz52Laa	NO. They have superficial similarities but the salvation plan is totally different. Christ is God and the Son of God, Muslims do not believe that

He has 5 proofs of the existance of God in there, based on pure logic.  <br>  <br>  There is also mathematician Kurt Godel's version of St. Anselm's Ontological Proof for the existance of God. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del'..." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del'...</a><br>  <br>  This is another good link to it <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/sector114/htm/p...</a> <br>  <br>  Now personally I'm not a big fan of the Ontological Proof, but many people a great deal smarter than I will ever dream of being put a lot of faith in it...(pardon the pun). Saint Anselm (1033-1109) English theologian and archbishop of Canterbury presented the proof. René Déscartes (1596-1660) French philosopher and mathematician (He's the one that first said "I think therefore I am")  improved Anselm's proof. Gottfried Wilhelm Von Leibniz (1646 – 1716) German philosopher and mathematician improved Déscartes' proof. Charles Hartshorne (1897-2000) Professor of philosophy from the University of Texas (1962-1978) worked on logic of Saint Anselm's proof from 1923 in his Harvard Ph.D. thesis to 1965 that he wrote its revised version of the proof in his book "Re-examination of the ontological proof for God's existence". Kurt G?del (1906 - 1978) German professor of mathematics in Princeton University improved Leibniz's proof. Melvin Fitting professor of mathematics and logic in the City University of New York, Lehman College improved G?del's proof and formalized it with third order modal logic.<br>  <br>  That's all well and good. Smart people from Aristotle to Averroes to Aquinas have spent centuries coming up with logical proofs for the existance of God, using pure reason, logic, and maths. <br>  <br>  And there are lots of mystical events in the world, like the cures at Lourdes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Medical_Bureau#Notable_cases" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lourdes_Med...</a> or the Shroud of Turin <a href="http://www.shroud.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.shroud.com,</a> and Fatima and Guadalupe.<br>  <br>  But I view all that as "back up".<br>  <br>  I know God exists because He has changed my life in some very real ways.  Praise God, and thank Him.|`|iblT1HJpaa	The history of mankind for all of history tells us that man "believes" in something greater than himself. It matters not what that is per se, but that it is by God's own hand that He has instilled in us a "question" that all nations, all peoples, all cultures and for all time have sought out the answer. <br>  By the sheer statement of atheists that " there is no God" is a fallacy beyond thought! In order to say they is no God, one must conceptualize God to come to that decision. Wait! There is no God! Hold it! I just had to think of God. No! There is no God! I just said the word so there must be one because I acknowledge Him by my own thoughts.............<br>  See? Atheism is a lie. It is an impossibility! It cannot be done. The statement of "I don't believe in God" states a contradiction. <br>  Everytime I hear it, all I can do is laugh for the incredible stupidity of the person saying it. Perhaps they never thought about what they were saying for it makes absolutely no sense at all. <br>  <br>  And in that - we know that God exists. Everyone keeps saying His name.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Can we physically prove that there is a 100% certainty of the Christian God? No, you have to read the Bible and make your own judgement.|`|AA10116612	You KNOW Him or you don't.<br>  PRAY, LISTEN, HEAR HIM.<br>  <br>  IF you spend time with Him...you WILL hear Him.|`|7mhRDbvsaa	cuz the pope says so|`|oVHFz52Laa	Christians have a personal relationship with God. We believe the Bible is true and we learn a lot about God through His Word<br>  <br>  It is not so much about the matter of " knowing" it is matter of faith. We all have faith in something. Faith starts when the evidence ends|`|LsJqpTWsaa	God has yet to proven, or dis proven as a matter of a fact. Of course it is simply far more reasonable to lean towards "Not exist", simply because that is how we do things.

I study all different types of religion. And the one thing they have in common is one main god even atheists have a god, the god is the I don't believe in god, god. Atheists can say they believe in something even though it is believing that there is no god, because religion is just believing. so atheist have their own religion of Don't believe. One almighty being that they can't prove exists but they just know it does. I know god exists because it's natural. I know you probably are not getting this, but just think, ask your self why it seems easier to believe that there is a God rather than having to find facts and dig information to prove their isn't one. I believe that we there is something out there that is bigger than us. It just feels right. Just like doing your favorite thing feels right they don't know, they feel, because they need to believe that there is someone out there watching out for us.|`|w4kTkYhHaa	well, let's think about it.<br>  <br>  1) the first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed; it can only change from one form to another.<br>  <br>  2) the works of Stephen Hawking outline how the universe and time itself, had a beginning. therefore, for the universe to come into existence, some kind of energy source must have channeled part of itself into the billions of stars and galaxies that we know of now. we know the energy source must be powerful beyond what we can imagine, for this reason. and since it created time itself, it is timeless.<br>  <br>  3) we are left then with two options: this energy source is dumb and unconscious; or it is intelligent and conscious. however, in order to bring the universe into existence, this energy source must have had a will. a will cannot exist without consciousness, and to imply that it was merely a set of pre-existing conditions would be suggesting that the cause cannot exist without the effect. but we know, from knowledge and science, that the effect (i.e the universe) in this case is limited, and therefore it cannot be so. furthermore, the complexity and physical order in the world, as proven and discovered by science, does not lead to any mathematical probability of the world being an accident, or the energy source being unconscious - hence the phrase 'intelligent design'.<br>  <br>  all other 'proofs' against the existence of God - such as 'he is unnecessary, therefore he does not exist' or 'there are too many to choose from, therefore he must not exist' are emotional, illogical, and do not prove that he does not exist in the slightest.<br>  <br>  all it takes is a simple bit of reasoning. cheers.|`|uQJnkwFVaa	Im a christian and i firmly believe that God exists because of faith, not only because of that but because he has made a new me. I was this type of girl who liked a lot of things i didn't and saw a lot of things that only made me change to a bad person inside and out. When I started noticing how wrong i was living i felt dirty and empty inside so i started searching for different things to make me believe i had a reason to live and believe in something. I started drinking, having boyfriends, seeking popularity but nothing gave me or changed me the way i was hoping, those things just worsened it. I always went to church but i never cared and just when I was about to make something horrible i decided to give God a chance to let him in my heart and i don;t regret it because i proved he was true because he saved me from a really messed up life. So if you are looking for a scientific explanation, well you will never find it, but if you try to figure it out yourself you will see that he really exists. Just try it...if u don't like it, you can turn away from his presence but you won't understand until you try it yourself.

They wrote the entire book in a 1500 year span.  These people were not in the same place.  The writers were located in Asia, Europe, and Africa.  They did not have IM to say, "Hey man.  Are you writing this down?  Make sure you put what I put.".  No.  The Bible is irresputively true.  Tell me how the books of the Bible coordinate into a smoothly running story.  How can 40 people, over a time period of 1,500 years, in 3 different continents, write the SAME EXACT STORY?!  Only by God planning all of it out is how.  <br>  <br>  The Bible is historically accurate, achaelologically accurate.  And it IS UNDENIABLY THE COMPLETE TRUTH! <br>  <br>  However there are several reason I believe in God:<br>  <br>  1.) I know God exists because the Bible is true.  There is no humanly possible way that 40 people who lived at separate times over a large span of fifteen hundred years in three completely different continents could write the same exact story down to create a flowing, sensible story.  They had no phones, no IMing, nothing.  And there wasn't any way that a person was traveling across three continents to meet with somebody.  They didn't have a Bible Organizational Board Meeting.  And because of these facts and the coordination of the Bible to so many events in history, I believe that God is real.  I see him at work everyday.  I woke up this morning because God made it so.  I am alive because he made it so.  So you cannot dispute with me the existance of the Lord.  I know He is real.  There is no other explanation PERIOD.<br>  <br>  2.) Did you know the Earth is the perfect size?  It's size and it's gravity holds the thin layer (50 miles) of nitrogen and oxgen we call our atmosphere.  If the Earth were any smaller, it would not have an atmosphere and we could not live.  However, if the Earth were any larger, it would contain free hydrogen and we would not be able to survive either.  <br>  <br>  3.) Earth is the perfect distance from the sun.  If we were any farther away, we would freeze, and if we were any closer we would burn.<br>  <br>  4.) What caused the start of the universe?  Scientists claim to know how the universe began - with a "Big Bang".  Okay, well what caused that?  They say that the world began with a spinning ball of matter, which exploded into everything.  How could the "ball of matter" spin if there is no energy yet in the universe?  How could our chunk of matter (Earth) happen to land in the exact suitable location to support life?  Science states that if matter is spinning in one direction and explodes that all particles that come off of this spinning matter will spin the same way.  Hmm... that's a curious fact, isn't it?  Why then are our planets spinning every which way?  Why aren't they obeying the "laws of physics" and spinning in a uniform direction?  Something to consider.<br>  <br>  5.) While we are on the topic of beliefs, I would like to ask a question directed to evolutionists.  (This is why I am not an evolutionist) If everyone developed from monkeys (which I find as an insult), why aren't monkeys turning into humans anymore?  Why doesn't that happen?  What is so different about evolution then as opposed to now?  Chew on that.<br>  <br>  This is why I believe fully in the Lord, not just because of faith(although it plays its role) , but because of FACTS.  SCIENTIFIC FACTS.  Science and the Bible do correspond to some degree.  I believe in God with all my heart, and I have absolutely no doubt that is working in all our lives (whether you know it or not).  <br>  <br>  I hope you have read this and understand why I believe this wholly, and I hope that the asker and anyone who reads will take it to heart.|`|6Zi7cA5Paa	1st:<br>  <br>  Once, a Bedouin was asked what made an unsophisticated man like him believe in Allah.<br>  Bedouin: "Do you see these marks in the sand?"<br>  Man: "Yes."<br>  Bedouin: "What do they tell you?"<br>  Man: "A camel went by."<br>  Bedouin: "Did you see the camel?"<br>  Man: "No, but these footprints in the sand suggest that a camel made them."<br>  Bedouin: "Do you see these mountains?"<br>  Man: "Yes."<br>  Bedouin: "They are indicative to me that Allah made them."<br>  <br>  2nd:<br>  <br>  Once Khalifa Haroon Rasheed asked Imam Malik: "What is the evidence (daleel) pointing to the existence of Allah (subhanahu wa ta`ala)?" Imam Malik replied: "Difference in languages, difference in pitches of voice, difference in singing are proof that Allah (subhanahu wa ta`ala) exists!"<br>  <br>  3rd:<br>  <br>  The same question was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no<br>  captain and no one planning its trips."<br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?"<br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless but he found out more about Haqq (The Truth) and proclaimed Islam.<br>  <br>  4th:<br>  <br>  Imam Shafi`i replied to the question in the following way, "The leaves of Toot (berries) are all but one. Each leaf tastes exactly the same.  Insects, honey bees, cows, goats, and deer live off of it. After eating these the insects produce silk; bees produce honey; deer give musk (a special kind of scent), cows and goats deliver off-springs. Is this not clear evidence that one kind of leaf has so many qualities, and who created these qualities? It is the Khaliq (Creator) who we call Allah (subhanahu wa ta`ala) Who is the Inventor and the Creator."<br>  <br>  May Allah guide all of us through the right path.|`|xhHxhai5aa	They Don't|`|AA11336384	They don't.

People react to these life events very differently.  Of interest is that the breaking down isn't about the person who has died but it's about those who are still living - what they have lost.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Sometimes people mourn quietly. It is completely normal.|`|7539ec184c5979d90293e53cc6ea20fcaa	If I don't cry at someones funeral, family member or not, it is usually because I wasn't that close to the person or I already cried so much the week before the funeral that I'm cried out. Sometimes it is because I have already come to terms with the person's death and I am at peace about it.|`|aztQDdMXaa	Don't feel bad, in the end, your grandmother would not have wanted you to be sad, or to cry.<br>  =>_<=<br>  but always keep your "shoulder to cry on" close to you.<br>  You will need that person some day.|`|STumBiU0aa	some ppl have delayed reactions to sad situations - when my grandma died, it took me  a while to be sad about it.|`|HG23pKdOaa	Everyone handles grief differently, and crying is not the only healthy way to deal with it. You may just be dealing with it differently, and there's nothing wrong with it. You may just be in a different stage of grieving--they don't happen in a set order; people can jump around between denial and bargaining and anger and so on--and you may find yourself crying about it later. Even if you don't, that's okay; some people just have a different perspective of death than others. <br>  There's nothing emotionally wrong with you; you're just coping in your unique way.<br>  I'm sorry for your family's loss; it sounds like your grandmother was very loved.|`|hwtIZH7Yaa	Some people are like that. Were you close? If so then your like me. My grandpa recently died and i didnt cry hardley at all. I only cried when i saw that they had put two little candies in the thing wehre u put things to be buried with him, that  got to me because he always liked sugar. anyway some people just dont cry during those times. you may be feeling horrible inside but you just can't gert the tears to come.|`|MeGehliuaa	A lot of people are in shock when a person dies, it might take a while for it to sink in. I don't think it's because you don't care, after all you're questioning your supposed indifference, don't worry. It doesn't make you a bad person, just know you care from the inside.|`|AA11156510	Everyone grieves in their own way.  Not breaking down at the funeral, or in anywhere else in public, doesn't make you a cold person, nor does it mean you didn't care for your grandma.  You'll grieve in your own way, with or without tears.|`|ucpKJcuKaa	HOLY CRAP<br>  Ive been thinking the SAME thing. Like, for some reason, i just can't cry at all, unless i like break my leg of course lol. Its really weird actually, like im a guy (13yrs) so its cool not to cry, but even when i should cry, i cant. IUNNO WHATS WRONG WITH US|`|AA12204752	You will mourn in your own time. Sometime when you're around too many people, you can't show your feelings. My deepest sympathy for the loss of your grandmother.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	you may be mentally tough, or you didnt have a good relationship with her?|`|AA11033942	I don't think I cried at any of my grandparents funerals, but I was 4, 8, 9, and 33 when my grandparents passed away. The first three I wasn't old enough to appreciate it, and also because of the distance away that they lived from us.<br>  <br>  By the time my other grandmother died, it was 4 or 5 years after my mother - her daughter - had died. I still visited her in the old age home but towards the end I couldn't cope with her senility so visits became less and less frequent.<br>  <br>  This might be a sign of my age: I still occasionally view the cine-films (now on DVD) and photographs that my parents took of me with them, and I vaguely remember it from the first time.|`|AA11613630	Sorry for your loss.<br>  <br>  You can still feel sadness without actually crying.  I'm sure you are grieving but everyone doesn't show it.  Hopefully no one is giving you a hard time about it, you know what you felt for her.  I have a cousin who just couldn't cry at his mother's funeral but he showed his grief in other ways.|`|HXVwG3M3aa	When the doctor came in and told me my son died, everyone in the room were all tears. Like you, I was unable to cry. Consider this: . When we cry over a loss, it means that our brain is moving forward with the process of letting go of Denial. Understand, I don’t mean letting go of the person, but rather letting the harsh reality of the loss begin to sink in. It goes something like this: If I cry, then it means that this loss is real. And if it is real, it will hurt so much I could not bear it. If I don’t cry, then part of my brain can still protect itself from the horrible truth that she is gone-and gone forever. And forever is so final that I just can’t take it.|`|5y5h5VYIaa	It depends on how you view death. I grow up with many people dying in my family and friends, I almost failed a grade because I was at funeral home so much. so I view death as some thing that has to happen and not a sad thing. So I don't cry anymore when people I know die.|`|cv222GL1aa	I had the same thing happen, except it was a Grandpa, I think it is because you are shocked and or maybe you didn't have a good relationship with her. maybe a little more information on your relationship would help

When i came out to him, i told him ive liked him for years and recently our friendship has been different.<br>  <br>  but i strongly advise you to stay friends with him. hes going through a time where he needs someone to talk to and he chose you. Yes, it may be uncomfortable for you to deal with because he has a crush on you, but a good friend wouldnt give up on a friend in their time of need.<br>  how you should feel, id say your confused and a bit weirded out at first, but just try and get used to it. your friend cant help what hes feeling, and atleast he was honest with you.<br>  dont give up your friendship over something silly.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|A1Dawc5paa	First of all, you shouldn't be asking people how YOU should feel.

I know that you value your friendship with that is why you ask this question so here is my answer.<br>        Speak to him, don't leave him in the dark his first thinking is that you rejected him and that you don't want to be close to him again. He has a lot a courage to be telling you the truth cause before telling you the truth in his mind he really cares for you and doesn't want to lie to you. <br>       At first you'll feel like you don't know how to speak to him but it's normal after all you never thought that, he is the same person that you knew that doesn't change no matter what his prefernces are. Speak to him like you always do.<br>       In a way you should feel both happy, sad.<br>     - Happy because you know that he values you and doesn't want to lose you. For him your friendship means a lot<br>    - Sad because you're going to have to break his heart by telling him that you aren't in love with him but that you do love him not in a sexual way but a brother way<br>     Help him with his love life. If he's a closeted case than when you two are alone make some jokes about it for ex: You could make jokes about sexy guys that you two see and this way he'll understand that you don't have a problem with his preferences.<br>     Make sure that he understands that you two are still best friends and that you're not interested in guys. <br>     Don't let some prejudices people ruin your friendship. If you best friend decides to come out. Please be there for him he'll need your support more then ever. Before he comes out give him some advices he might need it and if his folks are totally against it go with him to his folks house when he comes out.<br>  <br>       You value your friendship with him so much that you ask the question so I guess that answer your question.|`|0v9kxmI9aa	You don't have to like him back or support him, all you have to do is not let it affect you.  if it does and you can't stop thinking about it, just tell him that you don't feel comfortable being around but try to not let it hurt your friendship.|`|2ab1e6726e8bc4fe3d4df409fbea4149aa	look at it like this.  think of him as a girl that likes you, is your friend, but you don't like back, and go from there.|`|3BnF5juxaa	you should try it out and see how yo feel <br>  don't knock it till you try it|`|jiu5m1f0aa	First of all, you and him were friends before you knew he was gay so now that he told you should it change? No it should not.  I am a lesbian and I have happily been with my best friend for almost 10 years. Now that doesn't mean that you will be with yours. He needs your support and know that you still love him as a friend but you cant be his boyfriend. Its hard being a GLBT and comming out to people you are friends with or who are family. He is going to need someone he can count on for moral support b/c it is going to be a long hard rode for him, But at least he will be walking it with pride and satisfaction for being true to himself and having a great friend like you.|`|gFKbY9mmaa	well do you wanna have sex? if you do take a risk wants the worst that can happen?<br>  <br>                                 if u dont tell him/her ur not le/gay and u just wanna be friends

I-Ching is traditionally used for a specific person's fortune, but someone put all the hexagrams together and apparently it poitnts to the end nearing for us all.<br>  <br>  I don't know if its really all going to end in 2012.  It seems unlikely since all other doomsday predictions so far have failed.<br>  <br>  However if it did end, that would be the perfect day, since Dec.21 is our yearly winter solstice anyway.

It started out from the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar, that was used by the Mayans. The Mayans created this calendar that supposedly ends a cycle on December 21, 2012, leading some to suspect that they may have predicted the end of the world which is actually not the case, since many archaeologists have agreed that the Mayans intended for the cycle to continue beyond 2012. <br>  <br>  If anything, there is a much higher chance of humanity dying from global warming than from the Mayan's discontinuation of the Mesoamerican calendar.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help!|`|5y5h5VYIaa	People think it's going to happen becuase of the Mayan(i don't know if I spelled that right calander) it predicted the fall of the Roman Emiper and 9-11.

j9YiR51Xaa	I went from speaking an extremely harsh language to english when I was 7. I spoke russian but little english. To me english sounded different depending on what kind of person that spoke it. For instance. A person from the northern part of America spoke english extremelyy fast and slurred. People from the South seemed to be very loud and harsh with their words. People from the West coast spoke in a "lazy" or slow undertone. It was as if they hadn't a care in the world.

AA10214265	BBC America would be the source for Dr Who, which also plays on the Science Fiction Channel. BBC America has played the complete Season Four (whose Christmas episode "Voyage of the Damned" featured Kylie Minogue as a waitress aboard the ill-fated starliner Titanic). According to the website, it appears that Season Four will be repeated beginning in March.<br>  <br>  Season Five is currently being shot, according to the UK BBC website. Donna, as we already know from the conclusion of Season Four, is no longer traveling with David Tennant's Doctor. Apart from the Christmas Episode "The Next Doctor" it doesn't appear that any of the next season has yet played in Britain. Expect it to appear in the US about 6 months after it first shows in the UK.<br>  <br>  Also, it has been announced that David Tennant is leaving the series in 2009 and a new Doctor has been chosen: Matt Smith
3XLnDyupaa	They are shallow, that's why.|`|4MMkRlamaa	i don't think that people would choose looks over love. it's just that, when you see a person for the first time, their looks would be the first thing that you'd notice. it's not like you look at them and immediately you can tell if this person's a douche or not right? but eventually once you've gotten more "intimate" with the person and once you've seen their true colors, that's the time that you'd either choose to pursue that person or dump him.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	Some people yes, but clearly not all in my view.|`|ruiF2vxEaa	I would rather go after guys who can give me the feeling of love-at-one-sight and not those who I don't feel anything.

NNvcd5Bhaa	Well God does tell us to put our relationship with Him before ALL other things including relationships. Seek first His kingdom, and all else is secondary. If you live your daily life with everything that Jesus taught us always taking precedence over everything else, then you will be fine. Personally I dont think girls should have a "steady" relationship with one person before they are 21. Its just not worth it, and its much more freeing, as well as enlightening, to go out as friends with different guys for a few years.|`|tBwdVpG4aa	No, because they don't exist. <br>  <br>  Dating boys is not a subject covered in the Bible because in those times, girls did not date boys.<br>  <br>  Also because the Bible does not mention "having a relationship" with Christ.

(matthew 6:33)<br>  <br>  psalm 37:4 says to "delight thyself in the  LORD and he will give thee the desires of thine heart."<br>  <br>  hosea 2 is a favorite passage of mine.  in it, GOD is a loving husband who lovingly and patiently restores israel's soul and confidence in Him.  it can serve as a message that a woman's true love is GOD.  His love does not displace a relationship with a boy or husband, but it acts as a model for it.  just as GOD loves, protects, provides for, and nurtures a woman, the boy you date and/or the man you marry should be willing and able to do the same.  it is important for girls to get to know this aspect of GOD first so that they will know what to look for in a love relationship.|`|AA11703455	Here is a couple of  scriptures to consider.<br>  <br>  Every Christian needs to keep in mind that what we do reflects on God, either to bring glory to him or dishonor him. In regard to your desire to do have a strong relationship with God, you are doing well to keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  31?Therefore, whether YOU are eating or drinking or doing anything else, do all things for God’s glory. <br>  <br>  And when we see Paul's words about the marriage of a widow, would also show the standard that Christian women would consider with the first marriage.<br>  <br>  39?A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. But if her husband should fall asleep [in death], she is free to be married to whom she wants, only in [the] Lord. <br>  <br>  The above principle is in harmony with Paul's words to the Corinthians.<br>  <br>  14?Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?

cfv2utFQaa	You seem to already have very good understanding on Japanese.<br>  Instead of other answerer's guess, your question may be right and it is a reason complecated a little.<br>  <br>  The speaker in Anime is Chinese, isn't she?<br>  It's a long story. Maybe nobody can talk about it correctly, but I'm trying because I believe that you can understand such complicated history of Japanese language.<br>  <br>  Japanese didn't have any "standard" language until the Meiji Restoration, 140 years ago. The most stardarized language in Japan until that time is Samurai Kotoba, language of Samurai, but it is a kind of artificial language and even Samurai they used only partially in their daily lives. Ordinaly Japanese, most of them are farmers and some are town's men, speaks diarects of their own countries in Japan. The language was different among the classes.<br>  <br>  The new Japanese government of Japan had to establish "standard Japanese" and they did, but for most Japanese it is still very difficult to mastar it. The leadars of the army awore that many soldiers can't speak new, standarised Japanese, so they "invent" more light language which grammar is "verb+arimasu".<br>  <br>  As for amime, Keroro-gunsou always speaks this type of language because it reminds Japanese soldiers in 100-70 years ago.<br>  (Actually, we don't have any "soldiers" now, so it is only stereotype of the soldiers we have.)<br>  <br>  To add to that, in early Showa era, or early 19th, Japan foraied into the north of China, and faced to the situation that they have to communicate with many Chinese liveing in there to dominate them.<br>  Some studies said that Japanese government invent new language similar to Japanese and easy to master for Chinese, and other historians said that it is not forced, people in the area might started to talk that kind of language.<br>  There are some evidence that Japanese government at that time want to invent new-light-type-Japanese for Chinese in Japanese new area.<br>  The language is called "Kyowa-go", the language for consonance.<br>  <a href="http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%94%E5%92%8C%E8%AA%9E" rel="nofollow">http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%8D%94%E...</a><br>  <br>  Anyway, many people believe that Chinese people in Dalian, Mautsuria of other place where Japanese army took over have spoken that kind of "light-type" Japanese. Japanese people think the callactaristic of the language is "verb+aruyo" or "verb+arune".<br>  (Maybe the strong impression of "r" sound in Beijing pronounciation made this belief of Japanese.)<br>  <br>  After the war was over, Japanese basically lost their contact with Chinese for long years. During that years, Japanese started to describe Chinese in many Manga as "verb+aruyo"-type language speaker.<br>  It became a stereotype for Chinese in Japan, so Chinese are always talk "verb+arune" or "verb+aruyo" in Manga or Amine in Japan.<br>  like Indian-speaking in old Disney animation or Japanese described as a tour group each has his own camera.<br>  <br>  I think it is politically wrong, and at least wrong as a fact. I'm learning Mandarin from both mainland Chinese and Taiwanese, Chinese people don't speak as "verb+arune" when they try to speak Japanese.<br>  <br>  Anyway,<br>  If a girl speaking "verb+desuwa" in the anime Card captor Sakura is not a Chinese, perhaps the author tried to make some kind of effect like she is a "fushigi-chan", a weird girl.<br>  <br>  Thank you to read my long answer!|`|AA10948829	The lines are probabky koko e hairun desu ka and Meiling chan mo, okaado wo kawaretan desu ka. You just didn't hear the "n".<br>  <br>  They're not conjugated into hairimasu and kawaremashita because the "n" changes the meaning. It makes it slightly more informal and adds a feeling of giving an explanation, sounding whiney, asking "why?", making the tone softer and less direct than if you just used hairimasu/kawaremashita...<br>  <br>  The subtlety isn't really easily expressed in English because we don't have this use of grammar.|`|d2vENVGlaa	Hairu desuka does not make sense, however maybe they said hairun desuka.  The 'n' can serve as either emphasis of the statement, or make the statement a reason, explanation or excuse.  In the form of a question it is essentially the same as 'masuka', but usually if you what you are asking is important, or if you are asking for an explanation.|`|82c39534f59b368c599d61d6f18a8fc7aa	Bellie's right.<br>  <br>  Concretely:<br>  <br>  Episode 3 - Koko e hairu-"n" desu ka?<br>  <br>  Episode 28 - Meiling chan mo, o-kaado wo kawareta-"n" desu ka?<br>  <br>  ".....no desuka." will often change into "...-n desuka."

It is the ONLY Church that teaches the fullness of Christian truth.  Protestant churches have all rejected many of the beliefs and practices of original Christianity, and as such are really only "semi-Christian".  They exist in open rejection of the clearly stated will of Christ "that they all may be ONE".  The Catholic Church IS ONE, throughout the world and throughout 20 centuries, just as its founder, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ said it would be.  You will never regret coming home to God's own church and leaving manmade denominational religion behind.

I say, "stay Protestant !"  I love my Catholic faith and that's because of my family's heritage and ancestry. I've met many wonderful people from both Protestant and Catholic faiths and can clearly see the good merits and holiness of both religions. Therefore, I believe that if you have a strong Protestant faith and heritage, you should be very proud of that (proud in a good way) and seek to maintain and grow in that. I find it humbling and impressive that you would also be interested in finding out more about the Catholic Church as well, and would certainly encourage you do that as well. The history of the Catholic Church goes back almost 2000 years in an unbroken thread of faith, so I think you could indeed increase your faith by learning more about Catholics throughout the centuries.<br>  <br>  As far as Catholicism offering more, I would have to say that I've been very impressed with the evangelical efforts of the various Protestant faiths these days. I actually hope and pray that my Church can learn from and implement some of the activities and evangelism I've witnessed at Protestant Churches. So, in light of that, I think you could increase your faith from the endurance of Catholicism, but you should also see what your Protestant faith can offer you too, because it offers a lot !<br>  <br>  I've also learned a lot from religious people who believe mainly in those early Christians that lived before the 300s A.D. before organized Christianity also became state sponsored. These Christians, both modern and ancient, believed in Jesus and His Word and don't and did not have a Catholic or Protestant Church to rely on, but found heaven none the less...|`|AA12203324	You only go to hell if you do everything the pope tells you to do.

The fundamentalist Christian churches will no doubt have something to say, but they are a small minority, and quite ignorant when it comes to other religions. As a Catholic, I am free to pursue science to the fullest, accept, tolerate and understand other religions, judge people as they are, etc etc. I have never, ever experienced anything negative when going to church, or helping at food stalls, or donating money to the poor etc. Anyone who condemns Catholics is really just exhibiting a lack of understanding of the immense good it does throughout the world, largely through local efforts of individual parishes.

I almost became Catholic & found it no better than Protestant churches I grew up with:<br>  <br>  The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans, not even ourselves, clergy/churches (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write. It might save u from making the same mistake many made, getting caught up in religious beliefs that hv nothing 2 do with knowing God (poisoned tree & its fruit).<br>  <br>  Rituals hv no meaning under the NT Covenant. The Hebrew rituals were by instruction of God the best 1 could do under God's Law (None in NT). Other religions (even many Christian) either copied or invented rituals (the best humans could do within the limits of being human). Jesus' perfect sacrifice canceled the need 4 all rituals (doing them calls God a liar as it makes it appear Jesus failed His mission). The closest thing 2 a ritual is Communion but its not 2 b treated as a ritual as its 2 b treated most seriously (not 2 b presented as Jesus' actual body/blood - Cc belief).<br>  <br>  Many dont know the difference btwn a ritual done as a ritual & genuine "remembrance" - not possible without following Jesus' actual Biblical instructions - absent in Cc teachings (the Cc didnt write any part of the NT [not a Cc text - NT was written in the 1rst century by Apostles {NT Gospels/letters preserved the truth 4 all ppl not the Cc}, full Cc possession was not until 3rd century] which contradicts their teachings/practices/God's will, 1 in truth & Spirit not rituals - God allowed them 2 produce the Bible despite their wrong teachings like He allowed the Romans 2 fulfill prophecy without their knowledge [happening again today). A teaching can hv a truth in whats written but the action taken is superficial - The Cc/others, like the Pharisees, know how 2 clean the outside of the cup but dont understand how the inside is 2 be cleaned with respect 2 Jesus' actual message. The fact that the Cc & other religions hv an altar @ the center of their religious practices is 1 sign of their being about rituals not the truth.<br>  <br>  The problem is theres many religions & subset varieties. 1 day I realized they cant all be right (i.e. theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Most religions came thru ppl who thought up things 4 a God they & others liked. Some realized religion could b good 2 control the masses & 4 other agendas - but, religion cant teach u much about God (they cant teach what they dont know). Who knows more about a house the Builder or he who moves in later?<br>  <br>  4 Christians, the trouble began when the Apostles/disciples were killed off or died during the 1rst century (Christianity was illegal 4 most of that time). Over the next century others, whom either didnt know Jesus or were less informed than Jesus' 1rst generation of believers &/or (un)intentionally added in their own ideas/agendas, replaced the original believers. By the time the Cc religion became a "state - Jn 18:36" recognized, organized religion in Constantine's reign (about AD 325), most of what Jesus taught & original Apostles practiced were no longer present.<br>  <br>  The Cc mixed in things of Pagan religious practices 2 please & draw in ppl, thus, creating a new religion they labeled "Christian/Catholic". The Cc's, like other religions' agendas (some mayve been well-intentioned), was mostly 2 control masses & 2 influence politics (II Tim 2:*4; I Jn 2:*15-17; Col 2:*8; Jer 10:*2-5). The Cc claims they didnt distribute Bibles 4 over a century b/c ppl couldnt read so why didnt they teach ppl 2 read?<br>  <br>  God & Jesus hv never been about pleasing man. In fact, the Cc, RCc & Oc had made religions just like the Pharisees, which Jesus emphatically stated was an abomination b/c they were about pleasing man not God (Mt 23:15; LK 16:15). Even when Protestants/others split off from the Cc they kept the same wrong Cc format.<br>  <br>  Even tho these churches got rid of some of the Cc nonsense they still didnt know much about Jesus (most skipped over Biblical instructions due 2 various agendas) nor did they go 2 the Bible 2 find out all of Jesus' instructions [a huge mistake, as they're fulfilling prophecies against their practices (Amos 8:*11; Jr 12:*10: Is 5:*9 (large houses r churches - Mt 24:*1-2); Hos 4:*6: Mk 7:1-23 (John 3:*3,5 & Ez 36:24-27,*26); Lk 16:**15 (see Rv 21:27; Jr 10:**2-5; Is 1:*11-15)].<br>  <br>  2 Major Cc lies:<br>  <br>  1. The CC claims 2 b the 1rst church & since they r the longest existing church, they r the only "official" church. Jesus' Apostles never named their church catholic (not in the Bible nor in line with God's message that never changes) nor did they ever practice Cc religious rituals. There was nearly a 250 yr gap btwn Jesus' original Apostle's church & the start of the official Cc - there4, the Cc was never a part of or the true 1rst Christian Church (Neither a label, title, name, its history, # of members, amount of time it existed or claims made about them means anything (u can call anything anything). Its whats practiced that makes them either the whole truth or a lie. A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition/usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). I.e. neither Jesus nor the Biblical prophets were ever muslims no matter what Islam's definition application 4 the word muslim is & the Cc's claim of veneration of saints/Mary is a form of idolitry no matter what they claim (calling a dog god doesnt make it God).<br>  <br>  2. Peter was never a pope nor was he/other Apostles ever members of the Cc (not in the Bible = no apostolic succession) the use of the word pope is a Cc invention - the Bible instructs us not 2 go beyond whats written (I Cor 4:6; Rv 22:18-19). Peter was never a bishop of the Cc (he died nearly 250 yrs b4 the Cc became a church). Peter would never call himself a pope or b a member of the Cc b/c calling 1self Father & other Cc teachings r abominations. Even the devil knows Jesus is the Son of God so 1 would b wise not 2 trust any church ahead of whats in the Bible. Calling urself a Christian or saying u believe in Jesus doesnt make it true - recital of words means nothing.<br>  <br>  More wrong Cc things:<br>  <br>  Mass (not in the Bible) is full of non-biblical rituals, Statues (God isnt in2 dead things - non-living things can't help or save any1 - praying 2 them is an abomination), the Rosary & beads, mother Mary (virgin 2 Jesus' birth) as interceder (Jesus is the only way 2 God - not His Apostles/disciples - Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:12; IS 1 - Mary was a sinner & had children after Jesus - Mt 12:46-50), candles, incense, the cross (its a symbol of the curse rather than Jesus & 4 the same reasoning against statues), making the sign of the cross, stations of the cross, the pope's & other leader's garb they wear, confirmation, Trinity, the Cc creed & other documents, raising ppl 2 the status of "saint" (only God & Jesus hv such authority), purgatory, catechism, devotionals, sacraments, holy eucharist, penance, traditional/repetative type prayers & other things they do rnt in the Bible - cancels out any truth they know.<br>  <br>  Religion is built on what man likes, not what Jesus told us 2 do 2 know Him. The result is few will b saved thru most of them (u cant save urself by ur own initiative nor will good deeds save u - theres no good in any man - Rom 1:23). 1 must b very careful not 2 get sucked in or going 2 various denominations (especially if u dont hv a good handle on whats actually written in the Bible) as u can only add 2 the confusion.<br>  <br>  Just b/c religions made many fatal mistakes doesnt mean God doesnt know what He's doing. The main point missed: Jesus is the only 1 in history who said that no1 can find our real God except thru Jesus (Jn 14:6; 5:39; 10:1,7; Acts 4:11). This means "the" truth was complete & there4 finished thru what Jesus did. So, any so-called new teaching & other religious beliefs r invalid & cant lead u 2 God. The truth is either the whole truth or its a lie. It cant hv any lie. Either Jesus told the whole truth or He's a false prophet, among many, who should b disregarded. It would also mean God must not exist either (He either knows what He's doing or He cant b God).<br>  <br>  Jesus couldnt hv done nor said what He did unless He fully knew the entire OT (NT didnt exist @ the time of Jesus - the only way Jesus couldve known the whole OT is if God was with Him). & the Apostles couldnt write the NT unless Jesus allowed them 2 remember & know His purpose (Lk 24:25-27,45). Only possible b/c God caused it.<br>  <br>  No matter how much well-meaning ppl (religious or not) read the Bible they cant find Jesus without going 2 Him thru His Biblical instructions (Jn 5:39; 10:1,7; 3:3,5). God outsmarted man - the Bible is the only 1 that cant be properly understood without Jesus (Jn 14:6; II Cor 3:14, Is 29:11-12 - If Jewish ppl cant pierce the veil over the OT without Jesus then 4 sure all gentiles cant). Its why theres many interpretations & many thinking its fairy tales (Jesus came with the sword of division).<br>  <br>  voyc4rmwldrns|`|E07VAMNMaa	Yeah dont be such a sheep.

The reason there are protestants is because they dont believe in sants and the catholic hierarchy. they also believe that having all these statues resurrected is unecessary. also the Catholic church in europe used to be corrupt and give promises of salvation for money but thats not done anymore. protestants also dont believe in the rituals Catholics do. THATS the difference between the two, and its a matter of personal belief but both go to heaven. so now that you know the difference between the two, you can identify which one you are. you can also do more research on your own to find out more about the other protestant denominations.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	The truth and the answers you seek for peace of mind are in the Bible, not in any denominational liturgy.

It's normal for teenage girls to experience same-sex attractions during adolescence, but those don't make them bisexual or lesbian.  They're caused by elevated hormone levels and usually disappear once hormones drop to normal levels.  That's why most of the girls who label themselves bisexual will come to realize they're actually straight in a few years.  Rather than waiting to find out what their true orientation is, they're jumping to a conclusion based on very temporary hormonal urges.  And once they've announced they're bisexual, but realized they're straight, it's hard for their families and friends to take them seriously.  I've got a friend whose family still ridicules her for jumping to a stupid and wrong conclusion when she was a hormonally confused 15-year old.<br>  <br>  Very often, sexual orientation doesn't make itself known until late adolescence or early adulthood, so if you chose one before yours became crystal clear, there's a good chance you'd be wrong.  Your mother probably knows this, but worries because so many girls are "dabbling" in same-sex relationships because they're considered fashionable.  Sexual orientation is as innate to someone as eye color or musical talent, but you'll have to be patient before you can be sure what yours is.

Because Islam is a complete way of life. It tells man about the purpose of his creation and existence, his ultimate destiny, his place among other creatures and more importantly, it provides him with guidance to lead a balanced and purposeful life which will enable him to avoid the Hell-fire and be rewarded with a place in Paradise in the life after death. Simply Islaam is to “Obey Allah” (Allah is the Name of the Only One True God). Islaam is a verb in Arabic (a doing word). The one who does Islaam is called a Muslim. (Allah calls us “Muslims” in His Speech of Qur’an). <br>  <br>  well, Islam is a religion for all human beings as Allah created all of us regardless of skin colour, race, language and so on. The truth will come to a person who search for it with sincere heart and with full determination. Choice is in your hand. however, as a muslim i'll pray that may Allah guide all of us through the right path.

So for the next 2000 years, God punished them and all their descendents (who of course hadn't done anything wrong themselves).<br>  <br>  He then decided that in order to forgive mankind for what the first two people had done, he required a human sacrifice.  More than that, he required a sacrifice that was part human and part divine, so he arranged for it to happen.<br>  <br>  What I don't understand is why God (who set up all the rules in the first place) couldn't have simply, y'know, forgiven people.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	We are sinners and every sin keeps us away from God. No sinful person can attain God's kingdom. God wanted each of us to be righteous to the core, but human weakness does not let them live a fully righteous life. So there should be a way out to redeem us from our sins. God, being just and his rules are firm, can not simply forgive us for all our wrong doings. Therefore, someone should be there to redeem us from sins and to make us presentable before God. That was the mission of Christ. He lived a very clean life on earth, in strict obedience to his father. He lived a sinless life despite having all divine powers and all human weaknesses. He overcame his human weaknesses through the power of Holy Spirit and lived obediently until his death on cross. He suffered without doing any crime. His crucifixion and suffering was very painful; but he did it since his father wanted him to suffer. God, being a just God, can not let the sins go unpunished. So, now for you and me there is a way to become sinless. Christ paid the price for our sins. What we required to do is to follow him in every sense and keep on washing off our sins through his body and blood given to us. Through Christ alone, we become sinless and presentable to God. His suffering is for all those who believe in him and call him the Lord in their hearts; not only just calling him Lord, but doing his will as well.|`|AA12186845	One word -((( Invention))) of a new religion.|`|7ca5c6cf814ffe44b145b050ae60323aaa	I am assuming you use the word "passion" in sense that they call the week before his death "The Passion Play".  Ultimately this does refer to his passion for us.  I will try to be brief, as it sounds like you are asking for the purpose of a test question or homework assignment and you are looking for ideas.<br>  <br>  Passion - The Passion of God for his people led him to send his only son, proclaimed since Genesis 3, to die for the sins of the world.  God gave Adam and Eve instructions not to eat for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and they disobeyed.  This illustrates that mankind has always been bound to sin, as even without a knowledge of good and evil they still disobeyed God and sought self-fulfillment.  The same sin we all still pursue today.  Because man cannot save himself, God, in his great love, provided a perfect sacrifice for sin in Jesus.<br>  <br>  Death - The death of Christ represents the substitutionary atonement required for us to continue to live.  In the old testament it was the blood of animals (or grains if you were poor), now God has closed the door on sacrifices by providing one he sees as fit once and for all.  Since Christ stood in our place, we can now stand in his.  But before we can do that...<br>  <br>  Resurrection - Christ had to be ressurrected.  Paul writes to the Corinthians that if Jesus wasn't raised then Christians are all fools and should be pittied by all peoples.  the reason is that sin was paid for, but no way was made for life.  All that was satisfied in Christ's death was the punishment of sin, not the restoration of relationship with God.  Through the ressurrection we now stand in Christ, or as Paul puts it, "He who knew no sin became sin so that we might become the righteousness of God."  In this Christ has propitiated the wrath of God and imputed righteousness to us (granted us full credit if we repent and follow him).<br>  <br>  Ascension - Jesus said this was necessary so that he could go and prepare a place for us.  For as long as the Jews have spoken about Messiah, they also wiat for the resurrection of the dead and to be with God.  This is what the ascension pictures for us.  We will live and be in the presence of God forever.<br>  <br>  The way this works is that people sin and someone has to die for that sin.  The sinner, to be exact.  However, since Jesus has paid that debt, you do not have to kill your mom or dad if they sin against you.  Jesus is the sacrifice for that purpose.  We repent to one another when we sin, which is not just asking for forgiveness but avoiding that sin and not doing it again, we make resititution if necessary (if you steal something give it back/pay it back), so that we can then have reconciliation with one another in right relationship.

You would have to use a rune combination indicating what type of flight and to where/how. The closest you could get using just a single rune would be, in proto-germanic (since there are no alt+number codes for the runes) the rune "raidō". This can mean both "ride" and "journey". How it is translated depends on the surrounding runes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Well, even Norse Shamans are a practical lot.

AA11690436	Here's what Douglas Adams had to say about that:<br>  <br>  The Babel Fish Argument for the Non-Existence of God<br>  by Douglas Adams<br>  <br>    The Babel fish is small, yellow and leech-like, and probably the oddest thing in the Universe. It feeds on brainwave energy received not from its own carrier but from those around it. It absorbs all unconscious mental frequencies from this brainwave energy to nourish itself with. It then excretes into the mind of its carrier a telepathic matrix formed by combining the conscious thought frequencies with the nerve signals picked up from the speech centres of the brain which has supplied them. The practical upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of language. The speech patterns you actually hear decode the brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel fish.<br>    Now it is such a bizarrely improbable coincidence that anything so mindbogglingly useful could have evolved purely by chance that some thinkers have chosen it to see it as a final and clinching proof of the non-existence of God.<br>    The argument goes something like this: "I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing."<br>    "But," says Man, "the Babel fish is a dead giveaway isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED."<br>    "Oh dear," says God, "I hadn't thought of that," and promptly vanishes in a puff of logic.<br>    "Oh, that was easy," says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets killed on the next zebra crossing.<br>    Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best-selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God.<br>    Meanwhile, the poor Babel fish, by effectively removing all barriers to communication between different races and cultures, has caused more and bloodier wars than anything else in the history of creation.|`|YupMCYHlaa	That's like saying if you ate food for dinner, then what would you drink?  If you worked 8 hours a day then when would you sleep?<br>  <br>  Reason and faith can coexist in the healthy mind.  In fact that is one of the definitions of a healthy mind, having both logic and belief and keeping them separate.|`|QVKWVValaa	Faith would disappear. Faith is unreasoned belief. <br>  Belief is a reasonable expectation based on repeated observation and/or experience. I have repeatedly found that if I carelessly trip over a stair, I will fall to the ground. Thus, it is reasonable for me to believe that if I trip, I will fall to the ground. I do not need to have faith that I will fall. <br>  Faith is belief without question, observation or experience. If reason had any part in religion, faith would be questioned, observations made on various aspects of faith and experiences of faith would need to be verifiable. <br>  Once all these things happened, faith would no longer be faith. It would be reasonable belief.|`|564f663bd843bf78848130c65ab50bd6aa	Faith is always there. Even things that are reasoned must have an element of faith.

However, they reject it so God gave them over to their lustful, depraved and selfish desires (that's the cliff's notes version).  Even more than that, these people encourage others to sin and even sit around thinking up ways to sin.  Take that reason and apply it to what you see in the world and Paul has just told you how all of history was written and how all of the future will unfold until the second coming of Jesus, and he did it almost 2,000 years ago.<br>  <br>  Repent of your sins, trust Jesus as your personal sacrifice for those sins, and apply his ways to your life and see if you don't start to see a change.|`|sd6vzmF1aa	I don't want logic to be above faith, but neither to I want a reasonless faith. Faith is a reasonable choice in these matters. <br>  <br>  The faith that we have that saves us is from God, it is a gift of His mercy. <br>  <br>  God is all for reason, afterall, He invented it.|`|ffAwH6Seaa	Whats a matter ? Couldn't find any softer targets , like cripples or homosexuals to prey upon? <br>  Faith does not require reason, reason on the other hand requires faith that what you presuppose is true.|`|mekHjkxxaa	That's a great question.

d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	Our critical thinking is just FINE thank you.  It is YOUR critical thinking with is faulty.<br>  <br>  You give the example of the source of the mormon faith, the "Book of mormon" story, and compare this to the source of the Holy Bible.  Do you REALLY wish to hear the truth about the SOURCE of the Holy Bible, and WHY it is VALID?  I shall quote....<br>  <br>  The Bible has overwhelming manuscript evidence that affirms its reliablity.  There are nearly 5,700 known partial and complete manuscript copies of the New Testament.  These manuscript copies are very ancient and theya re available for inspection today.  Following are some highlights:<br>  <br>  -- The Chester Beatty papyrus (P45) dates to the third century A.D. and contains the four Gospels and the book of Acts (chapters 4-17) (P = papyrus)<br>  --- The Chester Beatty papyrus (P46) dates to about A.D. 200 and contains ten Paulline epistles (all but the pastorals) and the book of Hebrews.<br>  --- The Chester Beatty papyrus (P47) dates to the third century A.D. and contains Revelation 9:10-17:2.<br>  -- The Bodmer Papyrus (P66) dates to about A.D. 200 and contains the Gospel of John.<br>  --- The Bodmer Papyrus (P75) dates to the early third century and contains Luke and John.<br>  --- The Sinaiticus uncial manuscript dates to the fourth century and contains the entire New Testament.<br>  --- The Vaticanus uncial manuscript dates to the fourth century and contains most of the New Testament except Hebrews 9:14ff., the pastoral epistles, Philemon, and Revelation.<br>  --- The Washingtonianus uncial manuscript dates to the early fifth century and contains the Gospels.<br>  --- The Alexandrinus uncial manuscript dates to the fifth century and contains most of the New Testament.<br>  --- The Ephraemi Rescriptus uncial manuscript dates to the fifth century and contains portions of every book except 2 Thesselonians and 2 John.<br>  --- The Bezae/Cantabrigiensis uncial manuscript dates ot the fifth century and contains the Gospels and Acts.<br>  --- The Claromontanus uncial manucript dates to the sixth century and contains the Pauline epistles and Hebrews.<br>  <br>  If one adds into the mix over 10,000 Latin Vulgate manuscripts and at least 9,300 other early versons --- including Ethiopic, Slavic, Armenian, and other versions --- the total approximates 25,000 manuscripts that cite portions of the New Testament.  This far exceeds the number of manuscripts of other ancient documents, which, in most cases, numbers less than TEN [emphasis added] copies.  And in the case of the Book of Mormon, ZERO copies.<br>  <br>  === Back to "my" commentary... and if you consider that all those 25,000 copies of portions of the New Testament VERIFY EACH OTHER as to the content, HOW can you continue to QUESTION the VALIDITY of the Holy Bible?<br>  <br>  Is that CRITIAL THINKING enough for you?<br>  <br>  <br>  MARANATHA!

So many Christians, for example, turn their noses up at "barbarian" religions, because they are "in the wrong", yet how do they know they themselves are in "the right"?

So if I made up a religion, and said "This is the ONLY way, and I should know as I am the Son of God" would that make all other religions wrong?|`|KSCBdhDAaa	i think the reason people don't use the same criticism on their own religion is because they become, in a way, brainwashed into believing that their religion is superior & they need not explain their religion, that it should just be common sense.<br>  that's just me.|`|i6kgDVdPaa	too complicated to answer,Sorry !

But going from February 28 to March 1 left a groove on my thumb for all the twisting of that little wheel.|`|U7sBZKUuaa	Actually, I work the night shift, so I get an hour short that night. Na na na naaaaaa na.|`|QyAyQf3Laa	NO. Why is this even posted?|`|TEE4sJscaa	no|`|J3TGyOnDaa	It helps, a little, if you usually go to bed after 2 am. I realized when I was eating lunch today that I would be eating lunch after 4 pm tomorrow. It usually takes me several days to fully adjust. This year I'm eagerly anticipating  the shift to daylight saving time, because I'm TIRED of the sun setting before 7 pm.|`|hHtJOeu5aa	No but it definantly feels like someone jacked up my entire day.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I wouldn't go so far as to call how I feel a "voodoo zombie", but it usually takes me a couple days to acclimate myself to the shift of time (clockwise) change.
5tY3eZcoaa	I don't celebrate homosexuals, lol.  No I would never date a bisexual man.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	Personally me?  No, because I am not attracted to man on man sexual encounters, nor would I be happy with my partner "cheating" on me with a man.<br>  <br>  Im happy to have friends that are gay, and I treat them as any other friend.  Whether that be dinner, drinks, anything like that.  If it happens that we share the same interest, great, however it is no different than that of a straight man.<br>  <br>  Edit - From what I have learned, a sexual behavior is something that a person biologically desires in order to achive sexual satisfaction.  If a person is aroused by both sexes, yes they can be monogomus, but the urge is always there, and that would concern me in a relationship, as I would have hard time understanding, or respecting that urge.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	yeah.<br>  i never did before though. :/<br>  <br>  EDIT: ...it would be hypocritical not dating a bi guy because he is bi, considering that i'm pan. :/|`|da4zS4AOaa	NOPE!. I don't want to date a man who has been done by another men. It's gross for me to think about.|`|9goJfYZGaa	Yes. So what if he's bisexual? It shouldn't matter if you truly like the person.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Some of you are implying that if you did go out/have a relationship with a bisexual man that you would not want him to come up to you and "hey I want to have sex with another guy today, is that okay?" or that he would cheat on you with another man.<br>  Just because a person is bisexual that does not mean that if they're in a relationship with one gender they'll still continue to have sex with the other gender. I don't know any bisexual person (including myself) who would do that. Once you're in a relationship you're in a relationship and that includes not having sex with anyone else (unless you and your partner agrees to it)|`|pxf9LwQJaa	A bi-sexual is very different then a homosexual by the way. There is no way I can knowingly lay down with a guy with the knowledge that his piece was balls deep in another guys A** or worse another guy's piece was balls deep in him. Bottom line, my friendship with my gay friends are the same as the friendships with my female friends. I don't desire them sexually.<br>  I believe the term for women who hang around gays hoping to turn them out is called a f@g hag.|`|RLLASsIvaa	Hell no. I would not date a man known to be bisexual nor would I date a man who I knew had been with other men sexually at some point. It is a huge turnoff for me personally. However, some women would and more power to them. To each her own.|`|CIUAIxXaaa	I do not celebrate LGBT day or celebrate anything to do with that at all. I would never date a known bisexual man because, where there mouth could have been. Im not homophobic, I take up for gay people because they have a right to love.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	I dated a bisexual man. I knew he was bisexual before we started dating.|`|dae1d378a16dab63f48240cfd27d72f3aa	Uh...... NO!!<br>  <br>  And I don't "celebrate" homosexuals either.  Just the thought of it makes me sick!!|`|UMQgpnvzaa	no.........i just can't get over where that mouth has been.|`|fusc1cykaa	You make a very good point, honestly it'd be weird.|`|C9QQPROkaa	no No and NO i like to be in committed relationships that may one day lead to marriage. I do not want him one day to say hey i feel like having sex with a guy today is that okay with you? That's not my thing.<br>  <br>  edit: I have nothing against people who have those sexual urges its their business not mine. Im just clearly stating why its not a good thing for me. I have lots of gay and bi-sexual friends.|`|eoxx8KKPaa	NO  WAY  !!!   I wouldnt admire greedy people.|`|T588vfJDaa	yes have done, would do again|`|2tn8EALqaa	No.<br>  ...."Walk the walk"? Seriously...?<br>  I don't know any women who "celebrate" homosexuals other than LGBT people|`|WAoNhHB1aa	Yeah, why not?<br>  <br>  People who are saying that he'd cheat on you with a guy: That is a mean-spirited generalization.  So I suppose you'd be okay with him cheating on you with a chick but if he cheated on you with a dude that would somehow be worse?  Honestly I'd just be mad he cheated.

ORbFRn4oaa	The SPECIFIC months that are being referred to in 9:5 are the "Sacred Months" of Hajj.<br>  <br>  Ref. 2:193, 194<br>  <br>  2:193<br>  You may also fight them to eliminate oppression, and to worship GOD freely. If they refrain, you shall not aggress; aggression is permitted only against the aggressors.<br>  <br>  2:194<br>  During the Sacred Months, aggression may be met by an equivalent response. If they attack you, you may retaliate by inflicting an equitable retribution. You shall observe GOD and know that GOD is with the righteous.<br>  <br>  Note:  During the Sacred months ONLY self defense is allowed. <br>  <br>  The verses following these verses talk about Hajj.<br>  <br>  2:217<br>  They ask you about the Sacred Months and fighting therein: say, "Fighting therein is a sacrilege. However, repelling from the path of GOD and disbelieving in Him and in the sanctity of the Sacred Masjid, and evicting its people, are greater sacrileges in the sight of GOD. Oppression is worse than murder." They will always fight you to revert you from your religion, if they can. Those among you who revert from their religion, and die as disbelievers, have nullified their works in this life and the Hereafter. These are the dwellers of Hell, wherein they abide forever.<br>  <br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  These months are also mentioned in the verses :<br>  <br>  5:2, 5:97, 9:5, 9:36 and 9:37.<br>  <br>  The verse 9:36 clarifies that the count of months to God is 12. The verse 9:37 also tells that the months are at a STRETCH and will be altered by the Oganized Islam. Which is indeed they did.<br>  <br>  Since Hajj has traditionally been held in Zilhaj. Therefore Zilhaj is ONE of the four months. Now if we count 4 back and 4 ahead of Zilhaj. We can quickly rule out the possibility of backwards i.e. Ramadan is the month in which Hajj is NOT performed (as is also evident in another verse regarding Hajj).<br>  <br>  A further analysis clarifies that these four months are : Zilhaj, Muharram, Safar and Rabi-ul-Awal.|`|Wf5Tzbw5aa	They are specific months. It is not allowed to alter them with any other months. But in these months, Qitaal (battle) is prohibited. Jihad does not mean Qitaal. Jihad means to strive and to struggle. Many people do not marry in these months due to Shia rituals. But it has no links to Islam.<br>  <br>  It is not allowed to attack anyone during these months but if some one attacks you, you can fight back to save yourself.<br>  <br>  Quran says:<br>  <br>  2:194 Fight during the sacred months if you are attacked:for a violation of sanctity is [subject to the law of] just retribution. Thus, if anyone commits aggression against you, attack him just as he has attacked you - but remain conscious of God, and know that God is with those who are conscious of Him.<br>  <br>  Those sacred months are:<br>  <br>  009.093.539 - ONENESS, UNIQUENESS OF ALLAH (TAWHEED) -  -  -  -<br>  <br>  Narrated Abu Bakra<br>  <br>  The Prophet said, "Time has come back to its original state which it had when Allah created the Heavens and the Earth, the year is twelve months, of which four are sacred; (and out of these four) three are insuccession, namely, Dhul-Qa'da, Dhul-Hijja and Muharram, and (the fourth one) Rajab Mudar which is between Jumad (Ath-Tham) and Sha'ban."|`|jHWEEZmCaa	they are called in qoran: the forbidden months, "alHorom" the one is "haram". the arab pagans used it for pilgrimage "haj" so there was need to keep peace in them.<br>  since Mohammedans worship mohammad not god, they only perform pilgrimage just when the prophet did it, and they don't allow it in the other times except as a visit "omra". so they step on each other and kill each other, instead of following god's order in qoran: pilgrimage is well known months.<br>  they are four moon months that are well known for arabs: tholqe'da, tholhejja, moharram, and rajab. no historian ever doubted that, but some tried to make doubts by claiming that there are two rajabs for two different tribes. but there is now one rajab that is used in arabic moon calenders.<br>  as for the submitters opinion that shah talked about, i never heard or read about it. and i don't think that it's possible to doubt tholqe'da, which means the setting. (away from war)|`|uQ2mezNiaa	This is speciality of Islam that in these 4 sacred months Jihad is forbidden.<br>  If the world follow on this element of Islam and stop wars in 4 months a year, the world situation would be different.<br>  these are specific months of the year, I think the last 4, Ramadan, Shawal, DheQua'ad and Dhil-Hajj.
YnGIccE8aa	I really believe you should not be confirmed this early anyway. You are free to not be confirmed until you are ready. Maybe that isn't the *vibe* around you, but it is your right -- exercise it!!!<br>  <br>  I have to say I admire a kid that actually doubts and is willing to learn about the faith and think things through. GOOD FOR YOU!<br>  <br>  Don't be so quick to judge the Catholic church either. To just lump it into an "anti-contraception, anti-feminist, anti-choice, homophobic monster." We have a whole bunch of understanding, and with study you can see the inherent good of our church. While homosexuality is against "design" that simply means that marriage between two people of the same sex can't pro-create -- which IS God's design. The catechism is very specific about being loving and good towards our gay brothers and sisters. Period.<br>  <br>  I think if you actually study our faith (meaning study the faith in factual history, sacred tradition, and not just anti-catholic rhetoric) and know it inside and out you'll feel better about making your decision.<br>  <br>  I'll honor your decision a whole heck of a lot more than the kids who come in knowing the answers to their CCD homework because they asked for them at yahoo answers.<br>  <br>  God Bless and may you find the right path. . .|`|qGFyBSEyaa	I think that you should tell your parents that you feel you are not mature enough to handle confirmation and would be able to truly confirm yourself. This may not be true but it will probably get your parents off your back for a while.<br>  <br>  You could also do the right thing and tell them the truth. You could say that you haven't learned enough about Catholicism to be confirmed and you don't want to make a false vow.<br>  <br>  Edit: I applaud you for having the courage to stand up for your beliefs.|`|rn7UAtYJaa	The only reason you need to get confirmed is to get married through the Catholic Church.<br>  And if you do not get confirmed YOU WILL NOT go to hell.<br>  <br>  And you can get married in any other church if you want, just that you have to get confirmed to get married in the Catholic Church.|`|tQW18Kspaa	First talk to your parents if approachable<br>  if not talk to a school counselor<br>  Talk to the one in charge at the Church<br>  Tell them all their is "Freedom of Religion" in this <br>  country and you don't want Catholicism forced<br>  upon you as a child.<br>  Jesus did not get baptized till he was an Adult<br>  Old enough to know about Religion<br>  <br>  Or to keep the peace you could just <br>  go through the motions for now and<br>  change your Religion later.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	12 is entirely too young for confirmation.  I was confirmed at 14 and left the church at 15, so confirmation was a huge waste of time for me.  Do what you think is right, wait a couple of years and see how you feel.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Confirmation is a choice. It is when you choose to confirm your relationship to Jesus and your acceptance of the Catholic church's teachings.<br>  <br>  So you have 2 choices:<br>  <br>  Go up there and lie to everyone; to the priests, your parents, lie to the congregation before God and say you accept their teachings. Get the gifts and a pat on the back, keep peace in your family and prevent anyone from bugging you about your beliefs... just go along and fake it for now.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Talk to your parents and priest about not being confirmed, at least not this year. While it's traditional at your age, it's by no means a rule. <br>  <br>  If your parents tell you you have to do it, ask them if they are comfortable with making you commit a mortal sin.
81nGin29aa	Well, I know I've met a Russian before, but it never occurs to me what nationalities people look like.  I at times can tell what nationality they are by their accent and/or their last name.<br>  <br>  As for finding out your heritage, you just ask your family: your parents, siblings, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins.  They would also tell you how is it you look Russian by knowing the physical traits.|`|ejuJiZAAaa	lotta people think i m balchi and i dont even know who or what they are. it happens. probably a good thing|`|v1JBAwSTaa	No, some people can pass for another ethnicity.

For instance, my friend is pure Indian but gets called everything other than Indian (Italian, American, Russian, ...).|`|J5q9AcMmaa	Yeah possiblr, while we're on the subject of ethnicity, perhaps you all could answer my question regarding the future of the US:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AvFPSqgrwyX6NsWVpv4gT2Hsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307192207AAIEgaL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|TFz8udnQaa	um... lmfao most likely.... what kind of question is that?

Who am I to judge another<br>  When I walk imperfectly?<br>  In the quiet heart is hidden<br>  Sorrow that the eye can’t see.<br>  Who am I to judge another?<br>  <br>  3.

Savior, may I love my brother<br>  As I know thou lovest me,<br>  Find in thee my strength, my beacon,<br>  For thy servant I would be.<br>  Savior, may I love my brother—<br>  <br>  <br>  I believe so, yes.|`|6DmsiLGbaa	Yes, absolutely.  God did not, after all, place us on this earth in isolation.  We have families, friends, neighbors...all people we're meant to care about and for.  Though of course it's often easier not to get involved, it's our responsibility and privilege to look after one another as we would wish to be looked after in turn.<br>  <br>  To be absolutely clear, though, being our brother's keeper does not automatically make us into our brother's tattletale.  God wants us to look after each other, not report on each other!  If someone around you is doing themselves harm or going against God, you owe it to your Father in Heaven to do what you can to guide them back to the right path.  Sometimes this just means setting the correct example or being there when they need to talk.  It could mean inviting a friend on an outing so they're not in temptation's path.  <br>  <br>  I personally feel that telling someone else of a loved one's problem is only necessary if that person is doing great harm to themselves or others.  After all, if someone were terribly sick but refusing treatment, wouldn't you seek help to get them to a doctor?  It isn't any different for illnesses of the spirit.  If it's that serious, no matter how much you love that person and wish to respect their privacy, you can best help them by seeking the advice of your bishop.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	The LDS are very deeply involved in humanitarian causes. They are often first on the scene of natural disasters, and do not limit help to members, but all who suffer.<br>  <br>  Edit Add: I wasn't sure where you were going with this question and so I decided to give you a non-answer that leaned a bit toward your question. Thank you for the clarification.<br>  <br>  As visiting and home teachers, we have an obligation to work with the family and help as the family requests, yes. As to correcting someone else's faults, I'm not sure that I would say we are charged with that, unless we have the authority to do so. It seems we all have faults, so calling someone to repentance is one of those things that left to those that hold the "keys" of authority.<br>  <br>  It is our charge to help arrange meetings for those who wish to return to full fellowship -- many times, a person will have committed a grievous sin, but let it foster. Eventually, they may come to a point in their lives where they want to clear it up by going through the repentance process. I was approached once and asked that they not go into the details, but contacted the bishop with their permission and let things play out their course. We attended the baptism of this wonderful person later after they had gone through the process.<br>  <br>  If we know someone is in need, we certainly have the opportunity to serve. Sometimes it is no more than a bag of groceries left on a doorstep.<br>  <br>  If you are asking about a sinner, the answer is a qualified yes, but only insomuch as to express our displeasure over someone's actions, much like someone did for me when I was a teen. He said simply, I wish you hadn't said that. I still remember what he said and the impact it had on my life.<br>  <br>  He wasn't judging me, but what I had done. And that is where an important distinction should be made. It is the same with parenting. We may dislike what our children do, but we still love them. And love is the key --<br>  <br>  Edit Add: My position is no more than what happened to me. Showing disappointment in another's actions tends to carry a lot of weight. Preaching at them seems rude and more along the lines of fault-finding.<br>  <br>  To be honest, even after many years of teaching adults at all levels (from investigators to institute classes), I don't think that I've ever run across anything that suggested we preach repentance in the sense of looking for the faults in another. What I remember is the lesson where were are to take care of our own situation, (the beam in our own eye) rather than worry about the mote in our brother's eye.<br>  <br>  But that certainly does not alleviate our responsibilities to those we are assigned to home and visit teach. We just need to make sure that our lessons express our love, so they do not see us as their enemy...|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	Yes, but it's not intended to be a "tattle tale tirade". The Bible is very specific.Also, we must put ourselves in their shoes.How would we feel hearing from them what WE are saying to them?Matt.18:15-17and I Cor. 5:11are the examples in the Bible.It is our Christian duty to do this.It is also a Christian duty for the church to disfellowship members as a last resort.It's not we can, it's we must!God Bless you!|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I actually yelled at my brother today. <br>  But he deserved it for taking the last bread stick at Olive Garden. :] <br>  <br>  Seriously though. I could work on that.|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	This question is a bit difficult to answer Wispy. But maybe an example of it I can think of was that my mother and I do visiting teaching. Well one month we couldn't get in contact with a member. My mother, God bless her, she was really worried that this sister was upset or angry at her and so my mom wrote her a letter and asked if whether she was upset at her. <br>  <br>  This afternoon, we got a letter from the sister saying that she had been very stressed out because her daughter and her ex-Son in law had been causing problems. She also has a heart condition. The doctor ordered her to complete bed rest and not to move, period. And so all this time my mom and I had been trying to contact her and we couldn't reach her, she had basically been in bed and not been able to move. <br>  <br>  I told my mom we really had to talk to our Relief Society president to see if their was something that could be done for her as well as see if we could visit her sometime. <br>  <br>  I am not sure about a burden to correct fellow members, but I know it is our burden to look after and help fellow members whenever and wherever there needs need to be looked after.  I feel that relating to you this qualifies as being my brother's ...well Sister's keeper.
Ps0tDYBAaa	my best friend is a black guy and i remember him buying those Gillette fusion razors. they seem to work on him.|`|FKxrJxbPaa	Depends<br>  <br>  Typically I dont shave with a razor because I have serious issues with ingrown hairs, so I use a Braun electric shaver most of the time. <br>  <br>  However if I'm goin someplace nice or need to look good that day, I'll take time out and shave proper lol. In those cases I use one of them old-school straightrazors (throwback to grandpa days...i know) because even though they take a long time they give you an almost perfect shave.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	I'm not a man, but my husband is always looking for the best razor and shaving gel, because of ingrown hairs.  He found that shaving gel works better than shaving cream for black hair, and he likes Gillette disposables, because using a new one every three days gets a better shave.

NNvcd5Bhaa	the Bible is not against gay marriage, if you dont believe me, watch the documetary call "for the bible tells me so"|`|Ijl20aZ3aa	Gay marriage is not banned because the Bible says it's wrong, it's banned because gay marriage is immoral and perverted. No disrespect to those who are gay or lesbian. The reason why a person becomes attracted to the same sex as themselves is because they did not get the needed attention from their mother (if they are female) or father (if they are male), so they go elsewhere for the attention they desperately need. <br>  <br>  In this society so many people think this is okay, that this is who they are, and they can't change it. But they're wrong.<br>  In the book "101 Frequently Asked Questions About Homosexuality" by ex-gay Mike Haley, he quotes Dr. Nicolosi's analysis of what happens when a young boy fails to identify with the masculinity of his father and begins to identify with the feminine in his mother. Eventually, this disidentification with the masculine becomes eroticized and homosexual behavior is often the result.<br>  <br>  A societal acceptance of same sex relationships gives vulnerable children the impression that same sex relationships are good, moral and healthy. Medical professionals have affirmed that these kinds of sexual relationships are unhealthy. A society that accepts immoral relationships cause children to stumble into immorality. Acceptance of these unnatural acts sets a society up for gender and sexual confusion, which brings about widespread immorality, which tears the family down.<br>  <br>  Logically speaking, if everyone's sexuality was expressed heterosexually, then humanity will survive and perpetuate our own kind for generations to come. But simply put, if everyone's sexuality was expressed homosexually, we would go extinct. Therefore homosexuality is counter productive to the survival of the human race.<br>  <br>  Check out this article about studies that suggest that children who grow up with openly homosexual parents, are more likely to be homosexual themselves than children who do not: <a href="http://www.drtraycehansen.com/Pages/writings_prohomo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drtraycehansen.com/Pages/writ...</a><br>  The article was written by Trayce Hansen, who has a Ph.d.<br>  <br>  Homosexuals remain faithful to one partner about 25% of the time. This is a much lower fidelity rate, than their heterosexual counterparts, which is 80%. It is not unusual for homosexuals to have hundreds of sexual partners in a life time. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I think it's important that before you get a definite opinion of your own on a topic such as this one, you need to look at all views and beliefs on it, and then decide for yourself which one makes the most sense, and seems correct to you. I think this is what you should do. Don't just believe something because it's the popular belief. Popularity dies. Don't be ignorant.

It used to be that you had to prove "fault" in the divorce as well. ( This is from Wikipedia on the subject "Prior to 1975,[1] countries which permitted divorces also required proof by one party that the other party had committed an act incompatible to the marriage. This was termed "grounds" for divorce (popularly called "fault") and was the only way to terminate a marriage. Most jurisdictions around the world still require such proof of fault. In the United States, only New York state still requires fault for a divorce.[2]<br>  <br>  Fault-based divorces can be contested and may involve allegations of collusion of the parties, or condonation, connivance, or provocation by the other party. Contested fault divorces can be expensive, and not usually practical as eventually most divorces are granted. Comparative rectitude is a doctrine used to determine which spouse is more at fault when both spouses are guilty of breaches.")<br>  <br>  The exception to this rule was Nevada, which was famous for "quickie" divorces. You would take a train to Las Vegas and they would get you a divorce easily and inexpensively.<br>  <br>  The "no-fault" divorce laws of the 1970s essentially transformed marriage from a commitment to an "at will" relationship, and invented the concepts such as "the starter wife" and the "trophy wife"... as well as creating lots more "single moms". <br>  <br>  The campaign for divorce liberalization was based on the idea that "nobody should be forced to stay in a marriage when they want out"...but now with no fault divorce there is legally nothing you can do to save a marriage.... you are going to get divorced wether you want to be divorced or not, if your partner wants a divorce. People used to work things out because they had to.... that's not an entirely bad thing.  You see all these "friendly" divorces...where people stay friends after the divorce. Well if they could stay friends, they probably could have worked it out, given a little bit of an incentive and some cooling off time.  Divorce is to easy.  Been there, done that.<br>  <br>  I've been divorced, and most of the divorced people I talk to agree that they think it is way to easy to get divorced these days.  Nobody wants to force people to stay with abusive spouses, but with no fault divorces you can dump the wife on a whim, with little more trouble than you do a live in girlfirend. <br>  <br>  So tighening up divorce laws is a VERY good idea.  I know that's not where you are going with this, but it is none the less true.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Yes ban it all as the Bible says... gay marriage, divorce, cotton/poly blends, shellfish-- that'll teach those heathen Red Lobster franchise owners.|`|Johiu2cwaa	"Wow, this is the longest "answer" I've written..."<br>  <br>  That just demonstrates the depth of your bigotry and ignorance.|`|84gK4XlHaa	Good point.

What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder." —Matthew 19:6<br>  <br>  In Mark 10:9 Jesus states, "What therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder."  No one is ever to separate a husband and wife.  I wouldn't want to be a judge, who grants divorces.  I wouldn't want to be the lawmaker, who allows for all sorts of unscriptural grounds for divorce.  And by the way, there are NO SCRIPTURAL GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE.  In Matthew 5:32, Jesus said, "But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced committeth adultery."  Carefully notice that Jesus never gave anyone permission to divorce because of adultery.  What Jesus said is that a man would not be responsible for causing his wife to commit adultery, if she was ALREADY committing adultery.  How could he be?  To divorce your spouse is a sin, and you will also be responsible for their sinning if they remarry.  But you can't be held responsible for causing your spouse to commit a sin that they're already committing.  This is all Jesus meant.  If committing adultery is grounds for divorce, then Matthew 5:28 gives every wife Biblical grounds to divorce.<br>  <br>  Let me also say, If Jesus was willing to be despised and rejected of men, beaten to a pulp, mistreated, scorned, assaulted, spit upon, and crucified to death ... FOR US ... then we should follow Christ's example when our spouse does the same things to us.  I realize that this is a Christian attitude that is as alien as an unknown solar system.  Feminists and worldly thinkers cannot understand such thinking; but, it is Biblical.  Jesus was willing to die for you and me.  So why are professed "Christians" so quick to divorce their spouses, claiming mistreatment, abuse, extreme cruelty, etc.?  I don't recall any disclaimer in the marriage vows that gives a spouse the right to divorce under ANY circumstances.  What ever happened to "'Til death do us part?"  I'm not hesitant to inform you, that "irreconcilable differences" is NOT found in the Bible as grounds for a divorce.  There are NO Biblical grounds for divorce!!!<br>  <br>  If your spouse has left you and is not remarried yet, I would suggest that you call her/him and attempt to make things right.  I would also suggest that you ask your pastor if he'll go with you to visit your spouse.  Only sinful pride causes divorce.  There have been many instances of divorced couples actually getting remarried.  I realize that there are many different situations, and everyone feels that they are the victim in a divorce; but, God knows everyone's heart and WILL judge the guilty. You don't have to divorce your spouse!  Divorce is a personal choice that no one MAKES you do.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I'm a born again Christian who is guilty of this SIN!  All I can say is Thank Jesus I AM FORGIVEN!|`|KleF4mohaa	Ironically, the people that want to ban gay marriage want to ban gay divorce.  <br>  <br>  ???????????????????????????????????<br>  <br>  Isn't that what they wanted in the first place?

AA11690436	Actually, Darwin had been mulling over the ideas about natural selection for thirty years since his voyage on the HMS Beagle, but was reluctant to publish, because of the earth shaking implications.  However, when young Wallace writes him a letter, asking his opinion on the idea of natural selection, Darwin realizes that if he doesn't publish first, someone else will.  If you read Darwin's journals, you find that he came to the inevitable conclusions long before Wallace even left for Malaysia to study beetles.<br>  <br>  Even so, when pressed by friends to present a paper to the Royal Geographic Society, while Wallace was still in Malaysia, Darwin insisted on giving Wallace co-credit.|`|UWKF7x4faa	Darwin worked out the theory in far greater detail.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Darwin had been collecting evidence for years.

eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  The Church considers any act to reproduce other than direct relations between a husband and wife to be wrong.   The creation of new life is a natural result of healthy marriage.  The Catholic Church approves of medical treatments that address impairments in men and women that interfere with reproduction,  but reproduction may occur only through direct ordinary relations between the husband and wife.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church recognizes the disappointments of couples who are not able to reproduce,  and we pray that they will find a way to serve God other than by reproducing.  A child is not a right - it is a gift from God, and a duty to parents.   I think it is beautiful when parents decide to adopt someone else's child.  I realize this can be very difficult for the birth parents and the adoptive parents,  but it is a beautiful thing.<br>  <br>  I think many reproductive technologies are gravely disrespectful of all persons directly involved.   It is also clear that many artificial means of reproduction involve the intentional destruction of human life.

r4MdxTpUaa	Wolof is a language spoken in Senegal, The Gambia, and Mauritania, and it is the native language of the ethnic group of the Wolof people. Like the neighboring language Fula, it belongs to the Atlantic branch of the Niger-Congo language family. Unlike most other languages of Sub-Saharan Africa, Wolof is not a tonal language.<br>  <br>  Wolof is the most widely spoken language in Senegal, spoken not only by members of the Wolof ethnic group (approximately 40 percent of the population) but also by most other Senegalese. Wolof dialects may vary between countries (Senegal and the Gambia) and the rural and urban areas. "Dakar-Wolof", for instance, is an urban mixture of Wolof, French, Arabic, and even a little English spoken in Dakar, the capital of Senegal.<br>  <br>  "Wolof" is the standard spelling, and is a term that may also refer to the Wolof ethnic group or to things originating from Wolof culture or tradition. As an aid to pronunciation, some older French publications use the spelling "Ouolof"; for the same reason, some English publications adopt the spelling "Wollof", predominantly referring to Gambian Wolof. Prior to the 20th Century, the forms "Volof", and "Olof" were used.<br>  <br>  Unlike most African languages, Wolof has had some influence on Western European languages. Banana is a Wolof word in English, and the English word yam is believed to be derived from Wolof/Fula nyami, "to eat food." Hip or hep (e.g., jazz musicians' now cliched "hip cat") is believed by many etymologists to derive from the Wolof hepicat, "one who has his eyes open". Some etymologists reject this, however, and in late 2007 adopted the pun "to cry Wolof" as a general dismissal or belittlement of etymologies they believe to be based on "superficial similarities" rather than documented attribution.<br>  <br>  ????? ????????? ??? ?????? ???? ??????? ?????? ????? ?? ?????????? ???? ???????? ??? 7 ?????? ????? 3 ????? ???? ??. ?? ??? ?????? ??? ?????????. ??????? ???? ??????? ????????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ??????? ??????? ???? ??? ?????? ?????

Api5zLaeaa	Good Question:<br>  <br>  The body is the body of Christ. The spirit is the Holy Spirit. The One hope is salvation. Grace is oh so important.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses (like the Catholics) say there is an unbroken connection between the 1st century Christians and today's witness congregation. This is false. The congregation of today's witnesses is a hierarchy. This goes against the simple principle at Eccl 8:9 and Mat 10:41-45. The system within churches, corporations, and governments is similar to a pyramid shaped hierarchical system. This includes the Watchtower with its levels of authority in the system. I don't care how much it is said the brothers are all on the same level. The structure cannot be denied. Hierarchical structures do not belong in a religious setting if it is saying it follows Christ.<br>  <br>  Now Paul was given his commission directly by Jesus himself. One of the seven congregations that Revelation 2 talked about was visited by Paul. The others grew under the Holy Spirit. Are you willing to deny that Holy Spirit is able to do this?<br>  <br>  This is dangerous because then you would contradict the very words of Jesus when he spoke of what the Holy Spirit would allow us to accomplish. (John 14:26) We have this one spirit not because we are in the same club or fraternity. We are unified because we share the same Holy Spirit and it is expressed in more ways than Jehovah's Witnesses will ever dream to know. Because each accomplishes their dynamic ministry through their particular ability or gift whatever that may be. Not just door to door and informal. Come on!<br>  <br>  Let me tell you about my congregation. The body of Christ can be everywhere because it is not bound by knowledge, walls, race, laws, time, generation, or red tape. It is accepting of all people and each member can recognize each other by how they talk about Jesus. You can tell when someone is "not" part of the body because they have no love for Jesus. We are protected as a group because we are not a physically organized group so cannot be zeroed in on. Physical groups like Jehovah's Witnesses can be infiltrated by unsavory characters like pedophiles who obtain positions of authority due to hierarchical structure. Spiritual groups such as the body of Christ can meet together and may even have a congregation but don't need to be highly organized because it is a spiritual thing and we all have a responsibility at the end of the day to Jesus not a group structure.<br>  <br>  We in essence are unified in Christ. ANYONE who continues to use the history of the Watchtower as a crutch to confirm they have a special relationship with Jesus (such as faithful and discreet slave) will hold the same judgment as Pharisees because it is the same reasoning. ANYONE who places more emphasis on their own personal qualifications than on Jesus will ultimately deny him. Although they say they follow Jehovah God alone. This is key.<br>  <br>  Holy Spirit is not bound by time nor history but it is now at work within the whole body of Christ. I have to get more than a simple history of some off shoot group of people that promotes the name Jehovah which they themselves say is not necessarily the proper pronunciation. I have to get more than your personal qualifications as to how you may be an authority due to your many experiences. The way you discuss our ONE mediator to God is the indicator if you are a part of this body. If you disregard him then you do service with your lips which leads to cold mechanical responses that tend to always relate back to some needed bible study. Why not turn someone with questions to the bible? Why not pray that the Holy Spirit will work with that person? A witness does not have to do all the work from heathen to Savior. Yet most pioneers and Watchtower supporters would rather have someone who weakly accepts their doctrine than someone who intensely wants to find answers to their questions. Its less dangerous to train a puppy than a lion.|`|CmHLKKODaa	No and if they follow that reasoning then who are they indeed ?<br>  <br>  They seem to be guilty of the same sins that they Rail against the Catholic Church for !<br>  <br>  Maybe it's just their Earthly class that is guilty of Child molestation and like Vile things !<br>  <br>  They have as much Unity as any organization that is run by men !|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	How can they have one spirit and one body when they have two classes of people?

(Matthew 15:8-9)<br>  <br>  Like a dark cloud covering the sun, sects and cults are introduced by the enemy of our souls to pollute and corrupt the testimony of God to man.  The saints of God need to see this and guard against these "wiles" of Satan.<br>  <br>  Jehovah Witnesses have printed their own Bible to change the scriptures to conform to their teachings, and teach many heresies.  They deny the deity of Jesus Christ and the trinity, and hold that He was only a teacher sent from God.  They reject the thought of hell and teach that those not Godly are destroyed.  They teach that 144,000 faithful J.W.'s will go to heaven, and the other faithful J.W.'s will live forever on the earth.  This is another ungodly cult that draws in great numbers of people<br>  <br>  lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them. (2 Corinthians 4:4; Revelation 12:9)<br>  <br>  The only unity jehovah's witnesses have is that of been mislead and they have different classes of people one class supposedly going to heaven while the other are so happy to remain on Earth which the Bible clearly teaches will be burnt so what hope do they have.

One body and one unified teaching and complete peaceable unity earth wide.

These are the ones whom referred to in Revelation as ruling as kings and priests in heaven with Christ. So whom would they rule over? You guessed it, the Earthly Christians.This is what it is all about, a Heavenly government instead of an Earthly government. Daniel 2:44 talks of how this new king, would set up this kingdom by crushing and putting an end to all Earthly kingdoms. You know that was the way it was originally meant to be, Earthly subjects ruled from Heaven. There is more to happen besides this but I think you see what I'm saying.<br>  <br>  Christ indicated that there were differences in his followers:<br>  <br>  (John 10:16) . . .And I have other sheep, which are not of this fold; those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice, and they will become one flock, one shepherd. . .<br>  <br>  He was referring to the ones who had the Earthly hope. <br>  NOTE: They would not be divided; one flock, one shepherd<br>  <br>  You know that the ones who held God's word the Bible before Christianity was the Jews. Did you realise that they were always looking forward to an Earthly Kingdom ruled by the Messiah. There is many scriptures in the Old Testament to back this up. It talks of conditions on the Earth in prophetic form of how it will be and how mankind would enjoy it. You have got to wonder why that would be if we were all going to heaven.
VxTKNbJRaa	There are prompt words or buzzwords such as "pay attention" and "only jehovah's...". A lot is rhetorical technique such as "name-calling" or "labeling" which pigeon holes people as "of Satan the Devil" and "the world".<br>  Another is "glittering generalities" which makes a ear tickling statement and expects the listener or reader must agree or presupposes agreement then goes on to drive the falsehood home often using ideas and fact that are true but usually vague to support the falsehood.<br>  A third one is "doublespeak"/"doublethink". Where a follower can think two things are correct.

ZE9eTtRhaa	It is actually to remember the whole thing about him dying for our sins and his resurrection.  Showing us that even death no matter how it is bestowed upon us cannot kill us completely.  Giving us a hope of resurrection after death.  And then showing us how mighty he is and what God has given him as authority.  Its all important.  I was never  happy about just commemorating his death.  I always felt it was pretty morbid.  He is risen!  He lives!  That is the happy part.  He rules and can never truly be destroyed!  And they complain that people still remember him as a baby on his birth???<br>  <br>  Having only a few partake for classing differences is wrong.  That's tooting your own horn isn't it?  Now if you are not right with God for some reason, holding grudges against someone, sinning and not asking for forgiveness, not repenting, and a few other things is personal and between you and God....but to separate from who is going to rule to who is going to not is not in the bible that I have found at all.  In acts when the churches got started, there was breaking of bread amongst even new people coming into the religion of Christianity (Christ followers).  If you don't understand what it really means to break bread or eat of his body and drink of his blood than you shouldn't do it.  Since JWs don't understand this and don't want to educate to the full about it, then they shouldn't do it at all.  I mean nobody should partake in their religion.  Not even for classing purposes.  <br>  <br>  Again I would like to see where it's only for showing who was going to rule in heaven that only partake of communion.  And then again prove that all that was getting started in Acts was going to be rulers.  If it was being done back then, there wouldn't be over 8000 of them partaking now.  There have been too many selected over that amount of time if this was true.  JWs say only 144000 will rule in heaven who can partake.  Does anyone do math nowadays?  This doesn't add up, it goes over quota.  Either they got the 144000 theory wrong or they just don't have the communion right.|`|CjJKUMl8aa	Holy Communion isn't to deny Jesus Divinity but to allow us to remember once again every Sunday that what HE has done for us on the cross until HE comes back.|`|51WK9mGvaa	God has called me to write this letter to you today. You are a leader of many souls, and so I ask you to read this letter in prayer with an open heart. Please read these next few passages from the Gospel of John very carefully, John 6, 47-69: 47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear. Jesus’ body is the bread and His blood is the wine. Moreover, to get to Heaven we must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in “remembrance” as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‘ Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  This is your chance to answer God’s call and lead countless souls to Jesus’ one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church. This is the reason that God has put you where you are today. The reformists of the past may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way. We should not have divided. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure do a little research into the history of your church. You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church. We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away from you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist. The longer we are divided, the more divided we are becoming. Remember the old military saying “divide and conquer“? Today even the denominations are splitting into denominations. We have been divided, and if we do not reunite soon, the devil is going to show us an evil that will make 9/11 look small in comparison. Now is the time for us to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.<br>  <br>  You now have a choice to make: either turn from Jesus and leave him like many of his earliest disciples did, or believe that Jesus would never lie to us as He is “the Holy One of God” and like the apostles, lead His flock home to Communion with all the angels and saints. Miracles will happen if we simply do as God asks and believe.|`|AA10554783	It's a pity when you have two classes of Christians.|`|CmHLKKODaa	WORSE !<br>  <br>  It's denying Jesus Himself !<br>  <br>  Not partaking of Him is having no part of Him !|`|f5IcUlXTaa	Phl 3:2 Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the mutilation! <br>  <br>  What mutilation was Paul talking about?

This ordinance is for the entire Body of Christ.<br>  <br>  How long should the Church continue this observance? Till He comes again. What is our answer to the scoffer who jeers at the Second Coming, and who asks, "Where is the promise of His coming?" We point to the Lord’s Table and reply, "There is the promise of His coming." <br>  <br>  As for the people who obey watchtower and fall into their indoctrination they have no hope and all they doing is the will of the devil by saying NO  TO JESUS!!!!!!!|`|YnGIccE8aa	Actually -- Holy Communion is a daily thing, not a yearly thing.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Jesus affirms that Baptism and the Eucharist are both necessary for salvation.|`|n5AXfWEfaa	It is absolutely!

Personally, I think it is pretty obvious from the context that Paul is talking about heaven.  1 Corinthians 13-14 are basically guidelines and correct motivations for the gifts of the spirit, talked about in chapter 12.  The Corinthian church was way out of line in the area of spiritual gifts, according to Paul, because they were not mature.  <br>  <br>  Also, something to think about:  At the beginning of Acts, when the Holy Spirit first fell, and Peter went out to preach to the crowds, Peter, talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit (quoting the promise from the book of Joel) said that the promise was for all who would ever believe.  Jesus is still the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit and fire (He is the same yesterday, today and forever), and the gifts of the spirit are for today, provided that they follow the guidelines given in 1 Corinthians 14.<br>  <br>  If you like, I can email you a full explanation (wrote this all pretty quick) that is easy to follow and scriptural.
TX5uV9bIaa	If your question is about the integrity of the scriptures over time, then no...it has not been corrupted.  The Old Testament is the Jewish scriptures and we have ample evidence that they are intact.  New Testament documents came about after the death of Christ, and were held to a high standard for inclusion in the Bible as canon.  These are also pretty reliable.<br>  <br>  But if your question is about the Bible as the living Word, sadly, yes we have allowed our understanding and practice to be corrupted by the world so that the testimony of believers falls short of the teachings of scripture.<br>  <br>  The bridge is the Holy Spirit which teaches us and confirms the truth of the revealed word of God.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Yes Christians corrupted the bible.

The Bible itself is God's breath to us, His breathing out for us to breathe in, in spirit.  His Word is truth ( John 17:17)<br>  <br>  I would say that some of the Bible has been misunderstood and misinterpreted, misapplied and I think its mainly due to the fact that the bible has been viewed book by book in a separate way rather than a whole book which is related from Genesis to Revelation.  There is a central thought throughout the bible and because this has been missed, many things have been pulled out of context and ultimately God's people have been distracted by "things"in the bible and have not taken Christ as our central lane, line and goal.<br>  <br>  For example, many miss the fact that the bible begins with the central message that God has presented Himself to us as our food, to be partaken of as the Tree of Life, that this Christ Himself is the embodiment of this Tree, we see this Tree even till the end of the Bible in the New Jerusalem.  The Bible is a book rich in Life and full of Spirit and Life to us and much of its purity has been corrupted mainly I think sis, because we have not seen the bird's eye view of the bible.<br>  <br>  Grace be with all the genuine seekers of the Lord Jesus.<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|zUMvC6QEaa	No. They have "invented" their own version of the Bible to suit the particular denomination they belong to.

wB3AbJyLaa	This is wikipedia's defintion: "Irreducible complexity is an argument made by proponents of intelligent design that certain biological systems are too complex to have evolved from simpler, or 'less complete' predecessors, through natural selection acting upon a series of advantageous naturally occurring chance mutations." We've learned that the cell is actually run by irreducibly complex micro machines. The existence of these machine challenges a test that Darwin himself provided. Darwin said in his 'Origin of Species', "If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down." Therefore, the complex molecular micro machines that make up cells must have been developed a bit at a time, small step by step. For instance, using the example of the mousetrap. A mousetrap consist of a hammer, platform, spring, catch, and holding bar. Perhaps first there was just the platform, which evolved over time into a platform wit a hammer, then a platform with a hammer and a spring, and so on. But Darwin's theory of natural selection says that the system that work the best are the ones that survive and develop further. And a mousetrap that is just a flat wooden platform doesn't work. So according to natural selection, it wouldn't develop any further. It would be extinct. Like a mousetrap, molecular machines are irreducibly complex. Without all their elements in the right positions, that don't work. Since natural selection chooses system that are already working, any incomplete molecular machines would bite the evolutionary dust, not develop slowly.|`|cdFqekzZaa	How would a cell become a living cell in stages?

'au' is used for masculine places such as 'au cinema'.|`|Xsen794Aaa	The "au" is a compound preposition; it's a combination of "à" and "le" so it's used for masculine nouns that need the definite article. For example, Japan is "le Japon" in French, so "I go to Japan" would be "Je vais au Japon."<br>  <br>  If you're talking about living "in" a place, I'm pretty sure you use "en."|`|0c63fdd0630be2f6cbd717d497ab2474aa	"Au" is à + le<br>  <br>  Most city names do not have an article (exceptions include: La Nouvelle-Orléans, le Caire), so you just use à.<br>  <br>  In the case of à + la, you just leave it as it is.<br>  <br>  So you would say:<br>  J'habite à Chicago.

lAqV1OmRaa	I think it just depends on the teen. The common age for starting sex is probably about sixteen or so, but I was eighteen when I lost my virginity. On the whole, more kids are doing alcohol than drugs - its easier to get (older friends, parties, parents). Hooking up can be pretty common - it just depends on the teenager. I only know a few kids who hooked up (oral and what not) in the school (including myself, sadly). Most kids think that sex is ok, as long as you like/love the person.

iMplzgBtaa	It was my understanding that we are not responsible for any illnesses we are born with and that cannot be treated or reversed.  In your case this would be the lack of sexual drive which would mean celibacy is not a sin.  Most of us tend to associate our emotional feelings of love for another person with the concept of sexual interest.  You haven't said whether or not your friend also considers himself to be gay, but some of the things lead me to assume he is.  I guess that is really a moot point if neither of you is sexually active and don't intend to be.  It is a fact of life that some people don't wish to be married and have a sexual relationship. Many other friends have done what you and your friend have done and pooled your resources and bought property together.  In a sense this is not much different than two single friends sharing an apartment together and paying an equal share of the expenses.  The only difference is your intent for this to be a life long decision.  In my eyes you've done nothing morally or spiritually wrong and you are the only one who knows what you feel in your spirit about God.|`|h3gMzNS3aa	Maybe you should seek an islamic psychiatrist.

What u need to do though is lower your gaze, and for u its towards men. In your case, my best guess is ur commtitng a sin looking at your friend with lust. Living with him, and especially marrying him, is completly haram. U can find an Islamic scholar that would justify a haram act in all cases. For example, some "scholars" may say alcohol is halal, but just bc THEY say its ok, doesn't mean it truly is. Same in your case about gay marriage, its haram. U need to become a better Muslim and increase your faith, bc then these little things may not seem so important to u. This is just a test by Allah, and although it may be a tough one, others have had tougher. So take my advice, lower your gaze around men and especially ur friend, stop living with him, and become a more devout Muslim. Best of luck.|`|Wf5Tzbw5aa	Get cure as far as possible. It's a sin.<br>  <br>  Narrated Ibn 'Abbas: I have not seen a thing resembling 'lamam' (minor sins) than what Abu Huraira 'narrated from the Prophet who said "Allah has written for Adam's son his share of adultery which he commits inevitably. The adultery of the eyes is the sight (to gaze at a forbidden thing), the adultery of the tongue is the talk, and the inner self wishes and desires and the private parts testify all this or deny it."|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Just don't act upon your desires with this friend of yours. I'm sure it's a really strong friendship bond, and I doubt he has any idea that you feel this way about him at all. Allah (swt) has forbidden homosexuality as a Muslim, and marrying is completing half of our Deen. While his marriage did not work, for obvious reasons, it doesn't mean you should limit yourself of fulfilling Deen. So, why don't you get married to a nice, pious, Muslimah? He divorced her because he was forced into it, and that is definitely unislamic.<br>  <br>  --No. That is NOT Islamic at all. You cannot commit to a man, and there is no such thing as a gay Imam in Islam! That is absurd! A Muslim cannot be a homosexual. Period. You need to do some soul-searching with yourself, and resolve the deep-rooted issue within yourself, but as long as Islam is concerned, homosexuality is Haram.<br>  <br>  --No. Celibacy itself is forbidden in Islam. Marriage should be conducted as a Muslim, to the opposite sex. I doubt the "celibacy" factor is going to stick if you're going to be committed to a man you think you love more than what it really is. Your desires will eventually overtake you. Marriage has been prescribed for half of our Deen, because it relieves us of all the tension, sexually. You cannot marry a man, and remain celibate--that defeats the purpose of marriage, trust, relationships, etc. <br>  <br>  This is not Islamic, brother. I do not know where you're getting your information from, but the path you're heading towards is not a good one.|`|uQ2mezNiaa	If you have not done some sexually wrong thing, and control yourself by fearing Allah, you will have reward of it, if you both are sure that it will never turn into a sexual relationship, then it seems OK.<br>  Allah knows the best.|`|ewUsBS3maa	I doubt that this is a true story. <br>  That's all there is to say.<br>  <br>  --<br>  Your former questions highly contradict what you have stated in this question.|`|c1049adda026bb365dc17fb2b66df053aa	??? ???? ?????? ??????<br>  <br>  Im coming with answer in 10 mins .|`|9oQ0AwiBaa	I don't have an exact answer but I want to offer my prayer that Allah will guide you to the correct answer- you appear to be very mindful of Allah and submitting to him.

Do not try to justify your feelings on your disorder because there are always treatments.  Get testosterone pills or injections, that is the obvious thing to do.  And throughout your question you did not openly say you were homosexual but you obviously are hinting at it.  It is haram no matter how much you love him.  If you love him like a friend that is OK but do not lie to yourself, if there is something more stay away, because by being around him you are committing sins 24/7 through your homosexual thoughts even though you have not had sex.  Im answering this as a Muslim and it is Muslim law that you cannot give into any behaviour that maximizes homosexuality (being friends with this person) and if this is harsh for you, face it, its the Islamic truth.|`|zAfKvhW4aa	Asking questions like this on a public Muslim AND non-Muslim forum is not a good thing.

Because that is what you will get.<br>  <br>  In my personaly opinioin: it would be better if you lived with a female and loved her (even if it was only emotionally) while seeking hormonal therapy to overcome your situation.<br>  <br>  <br>  TO: MED, not every one here is a kaffir!

Eternity is for heaven only.|`|P8dIznazaa	The original concept was that Hell was the place where God was not.  In other words, it's somewhere where you're deprived of God's presence--completely.

It is a place that was originally made for satan. But since God can't be in the presence of sin, you can't be a sinner and go to heaven. God doesn't send us there, we, ourselves, do.

Many wish hell does not exist, and guess what, those who wish it does not exist are the ones who know they might very well end up in hell if it does exist, so they have a reason to deny it, however denial won’t make it go away or disappear.

Then we would not deny the Ayat (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) of our Lord, and we would be of the believers!"<br>  28. Nay, it has become manifest to them what they had been concealing before. But if they were returned (to the world), they would certainly revert to that which they were forbidden. And indeed they are liars.<br>  <br>       29. And they said: "There is no (other life) but our (present) life of this world, and never shall we be resurrected (on the Day of Resurrection)."<br>  <br>       30. If you could but see when they will be held (brought and made to stand) in front of their Lord! He will say: "Is not this (Resurrection and the taking of the accounts) the truth?" They will say: "Yes, by our Lord!" He will then say: "So taste you the torment because you used not to believe."<br>  <br>       31. They indeed are losers who denied their Meeting with Allah,[1] until all of a sudden, the Hour (signs of death) is on them, and they say: "Alas for us that we gave no thought to it," while they will bear their burdens on their backs; and evil indeed are the burdens that they will bear!"|`|cXxviTOaaa	According to the Christian church, Hell is a place created by an "all-forgiving" God, where sinners go to after death.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|u5tYX0tpaa	People don't understand stand that a big fiery pit is not actually hell.

If you reject God eternally,  He will allow you to have what you demand - eternal separation from Him.  That is called Hell,  and it is utterly devoid of anything good.  No human imagery could possibly fully depict Hell for the dreadful thing that it is.  Hell exists for Satan and his demons - who have rejected God completely.   It is not where any other creature should choose to be.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Jesus Christ was utterly victorious over Satan almost 2000 years ago.  His victory continues to this day, and Jesus wants to share His eternal victory with all people.  I hope you will reject Satan and accept the salvation of God The Father , The Son, and The Holy Spirit.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|AA11616515	The Bibles’ definition is; “the state of being when one dies,” it’s a continuing state until the resurrection.” That’s it ….it is that simple, and that defined in the Bible.|`|z2bejpm1aa	it is an imaginary place created by early Christians used to explain where bad people go when they die.

It is related to the same idea that heaven is the "state of being" in the presence of God.  Hell, therefore, is the state of being "outside" of the presence of God.<br>  <br>  It's the "free will" thingie, again, here.  God gives each one of us the CHOICE of being with Him or not.  If we choose to be with God, God accepts us to be in His presence, which is being in heaven, in paradise... eternal joy, happiness, and love.  But those who choose to REJECT being WITH God, God RESPECTS that choice, and will NOT FORCE them to be WITH Him.  Ergo, these people will be OUTSIDE of God's presence and in the state of being in HELL.<br>  <br>  Oh, and as for your question about God creating hell, if you can understand the concept I just explained, you can understand that hell is NOT a place that was "created."  How?  Since God is not a "created" being but someone who has existed FROM eternity, then it is only logical that wherever God IS is heaven, but wherever God is NOT is hell.  Therefore, hell was not created but "existed" FROM eternity... it is the place of "non-God."  Likewise, Heaven has existed FROM eternity, too, since it is the place where God exists, then it also has existed from eternity.  See?  It's PERFECTLY logical once it is explained correctly.<br>  <br>  <br>  MARANATHA!  Come, Lord Jesus, COME!|`|d8zxbKduaa	it's eternal separation from God.

zU9C6H03aa	I came up with my own theories regarding homosexuality while pursuing a PhD in psychology at Columbia. I wrote on a psychological study funded by Columbia that I led. We interviewed 100 sexually abused men and women. We specifically chose men and women that faced traumatizing levels of sexual abuse at early ages and we found that 86 of them experienced some homosexual feelings during life. Maybe homosexuality isn't genetic but rather psychological.  A young male exposed to a feminine environment is 4 times as likely to be gay during his lifetime. Statistically, most gay men have female siblings rather than male dominant siblings. I personally believe that sexual orientation is not a choice but rather a series of acquired developments. We have even found years ago that homosexual men are more likely to have a more involved mother rather than father and homosexual women are more likely to have a more involved father. Homosexuality is also correlated with hormonal balances. Unknown types of estrogen and androgen are also likely to be caused by external references (e.g relatives or media).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Gays do not choose to be gay! Citizens of the Roman Empire valued homosexuality. Gay men were part of the high class of Roman society since women were once considered inferior and prominent emperors including Julius Caesar, had "boy servants". Exposure to male attraction is a leading cause of homosexuality. Remember a kid's mind is like a sponge. What it sees, it follows in most cases.|`|80r2CQY1aa	Of course it's not genetic. Nobody has ever found that miraculous "Gay Gene" to prove there's no changing your sexuality.<br>  <br>  I, however, don't think you can change it. I believe that your sexuality is built based on life experiences and your attitude. We are subjected to all kinds of things that shape our personality and attitudes, why would anyone not believe that our sexuality is also shaped in a similar manner?|`|o1LOLYKlaa	i really don't think its a choice because heterosexuality isn't a choice so i feel it is genetic... i may also be bias because only 1 out of 3 of my fathers biological children are heterosexual my sister is bisexual i am a lesbian and my other brother is straight.|`|f194f22e2a1018663b2ef125c268418daa	It's definitely not a choice ... beyond that, I don't actually care.

Km6QTk9Caa	What makes your friend think that she is exempt from any disease or illness?    Anyone can get sick regardless to how they lead their life.   So if you do good things in life and behave morally you are not meant to get cancer.   She is not being singled out.   It's just the way life rolls.<br>  <br>  Anyhow cancer is not necessarily the big death blow that everyone thinks it is.   It can be treated if caught early enough,  the statistics of surviving are high.    <br>  <br>  I don't think you have to get into the whole god conversation.<br>  Just encourage your friend that she is going to be ok,  and that she will survive.   And help her to remain positive and not be so bleak about the whole thing.<br>  <br>  Additional:<br>  Look,  your friend isn't dying,  she is not even close.    <br>  I think you should say casually that you are not much of a praying person,  but you will keep her in your thoughts and hope for good things for her.     Or just ignore the pray comments and say I believe the chemo and the doctors will help you get better.   <br>  <br>  If you two were any kind of friends,   your differences in beliefs really shouldn't be an issue.

In a free society, you have to have some level of tolerance for people with different values than yourself, even if those differing values may foster  a culture which does cause some form of harm, however indirect.  Where direct harm is being done, chances are it's already an actionable crime of some sort.<br>  <br>  So while you could try and start up a modern day Temperance Movement, and propose an amendment to the Constitution which proscribes pornography ... that has no chance of actually becoming a reality.  Instead, why not identify some of the specific ways in which pornography harms society and volunteer your time and energy to aid the victims, and reduce harm?|`|rHqe7oMoaa	I don't think the majority of Americans would side with you in this.

It has ruined many marriages and has torn families apart, but you can't bring god into it, especially if you want the government to ban it. Separation of church and state. I'm not a liberal. I'm extremely conservative, but am not in favor of banning it. Porn sites do what is legal necessary to keep minors off, but if an underage kid wants to look at porn, they are going to do it. It's the parents responsibility to monitor their kids. If you are going to ban porn then you might as well band the internet because kids and adults can still partake in sex chat with other REAL humans.

America lives on the foundation of free speech and limited censorship. If you don't wanna look at it, don't.

A myriad of people contributed to the formation of the bible, from Moses (the first five books in the Old-Testament) to John (disciple of Jesus) to some unknown writers in the book of Psalms (in the Old-Testament). The bible is a rather large collection of various people's writings. <br>  God didn't "instruct" people to write it, He just guided them.

However, someone else had to write the end of Deuteronomy because Moses was dead.  This was most likely Joshua, who wrote the book bearing his name.<br>  <br>  Other books speak of certain people but the writing style and penmanship do not fit the era of the person.  Thus, it may be said a certain prophet wrote something but the historical evidence denies it.  This also works in reverse when someone God spoke to was given revelation of the future, such as Daniel.  The book is so detailed that archaeologists and historians say it couldn't have been written around 600bc, it had to be written around 400bc after the events had happened.  However, the writing style and penmanship all date, according to literary critics who judge these things based on many writings from that period to see how word usage, grammar, etc match-up, clearly to the 600s rather than the 400s.<br>  <br>  In the case of things like the Epistles, letters written to churches, many are said to be written by Paul, but not all of them match-up.  This has led to the discovery that Paul didn't write all of his letters.  He frequently used an amanuensis, someone who wrote what he dictated.<br>  <br>  As it is said in many churches, the Bible consists of 66 books written by more than 40 authors, covering something like 6,000 years (maybe more, depending on how you date).|`|e1Ecc6pxaa	God wrote the Bible using several men as instruments.

Make sure they know you are interested in the material and really want to succeed.

FOzN3xwzaa	You're misunderstanding James 2.  <br>  <br>  You don't want to overthrow the entire rest of the Bible, based on a misunderstanding of just the second half of James 2.  One half of one chapter shouldnt' cause us to throw out all the promises of the Lord Jesus. <br>  <br>  Jesus promises eternal life to all who believe in Him for it (John 3:16, John 6:29, John 5:24, many more).  JUST BELIEVING IN JESUS ALONE TO SAVE YOU. <br>  <br>  I believe Jesus.  <br>  <br>  James 2 is simply telling you how to help people.  You can't feed the starving with your faith.  You must do works for that.  But the works are not to save you.  The works have nothing to do with salvation from hell (it is referring to a temporal saving of someone from something such as starvation, for instance).  If you add your works to Jesus' PERFECT salvation, then you are saying that the death of Jesus on the cross for our sins, is somehow "not good enough" to save us.  And that would be VERY wrong. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a free gift|`|IiWz11Kraa	No, Belief actually means all those things you said.<br>  <br>  If you believe me when I say "there is a lion in your backyard" - even if you don't see it, you won't get out of your house. You might even call the police. So all those things you do is out of belief.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Yes.. because we also need to be converted as little children and also to be born again (John 3:3), and also confess before men Jesus as our Lord and savior :)<br>  <br>  Faith without works is dead but at the same time...For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9)|`|zUMvC6QEaa	Believing in God is not enough. You have to do much more than that if you want salvation. The Church established by Christ on the foundation of the Apostles possesses the fullness of the means of salvation, which he has willed: correct and complete confession of faith, full sacramental life, and ordained ministry in Apostolic succession. Outside the Church there is no salvation.|`|KmnbjZIdaa	Yes, because believing is an easy matter; it only takes acceptance of something as true.  Salvation requires total commitment like that of being married.  It also involves trust, fidelity and most of all love.|`|2MfMyh4Maa	A belief is a means to a goal, not the goal itself.  We believe in God in order to honestly seek Him.  I can believe that God exists but still reject Him.  I believe that God exists because I want to find Him.<br>  <br>  Faith flows naturally from a belief.  Faith is that set of actions and mindset that comes from a belief.  The progression is:<br>  a hope to know our Creator<br>  a decision, i.e. belief, to seek Him<br>  actually seeking Him, i.e. acts of faith|`|0lpXN8p9aa	We must "know" God....|`|564f663bd843bf78848130c65ab50bd6aa	Evidence of belief is action based on that belief, however works aren't necessary for salvation. After salvation and knowledge of what God wants, works is a natural response of a relationship between man and God.<br>  <br>  I love my wife, so I'll help her do things when she needs help. It's a work based out of love and the relationship.|`|OndkYzHdaa	Romans 10:9-10 says, "If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. With the heart one believes, resulting in righteousness, and with the mouth one confesses resulting in salvation." When the Bible says even the demons believe and tremble it's talking about a head knowledge versus a heart knowledge. The demons believe in Jesus but are not repentent and do not serve Him. As far as prayer goes, God does answer prayer, maybe not how we want Him to all the time, but He does. I could tell countless stories of how I've seen Him work in my life. The Bible even says you have not because you ask not.|`|rRGI5Wsvaa	Even then, salvation should not be attainable through faith alone. <br>  I can kill other people in the name of God like the KKK do. Many groups do terrible things, and that actually truly believe that they are serving God. Should they gain salvation?<br>  <br>  If it IS able to earn you salvation, why is it that a man with faith in God that has lived a bad life can go to heaven whereas a man who does not believe in God, but lives a good life can go to hell?|`|eSfCTgHAaa	You are exactly right.  It is the kind of "genuine" faith that counts.  <br>  <br>  Just like a little mustard seed grows into a large tree - so is our faith - it is a genuine faith - it is as genuine as that mustard seed which although the smallest yet it is - ALL mustard seed - through and through.<br>  <br>  It is the kind of faith that would proclaim Jesus is the Christ even in the midst of the most severe persecution.  Happy Sabbath.|`|D9mRZfRraa	Salvation is by faith alone in Christ . Works are an outward manifestation of salvation, not the producer of it. What James is talking about in Chap two, is that a genuine faith in God will produce good works, if there are no good works present in a believers life , that faith is not genuine. For example, If I ask my child if she believes daddy will catch her when she jumps from the top of the stairs, but then she doesn't jump ? That shows that her faith is not genuine and that she doesn't trust me to catch her , that's what James is talking about in this chapter. Genuine faith will produce action, but it's not that action that saves us. God bless. <br>  <br>  (New King James Version)<br>  <br>  8 For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, 9 not of works, lest anyone should boast. 10 For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Titus  3:5 <br>  <br>  5 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost.|`|cXXJVz64aa	Nothing is going to save you from death.

jiMAtaCraa	According to the philosophy of racial classification, Middle Easterners are "Caucasoid". Ironically enough Lalu, "Caucasoid" includes you, being a Somalian, as well as other Eastern African nations such as Ethiopia and Djibouti. It is a term that now encompasses Europeans, Central Asians, Middle Easterners, Northern Africans and Eastern Africans, when as a matter of fact the term was originally applied to those who are believed to have come from the Caucasus mountains neighbouring Russia. <br>  <br>  Therefore, it can be said that the term is and will ultimately reach redundancy and implosion as it's growing grasp doesn't show racial precision, but more so racial ambiguity. Charles Darwin (who authored The Origin of Species and theorized on Natural Selection and Evolution) who happened to be a monogenist, concluded that asserting different races in Mankind is arbitrary and relatively of no use: <br>  <br>  "Man has been studied more carefully than any other animal, and yet there is the greatest possible diversity amongst capable judges whether he should be classed as a single species or race, or as two (Virey), as three (Jacquinot), as four (Kant), five (Blumenbach), six (Buffon), seven (Hunter), eight (Agassiz), eleven (Pickering), fifteen (Bory St. Vincent), sixteen (Desmoulins), twenty-two (Morton), sixty (Crawfurd), or as sixty-three, according to Burke. This diversity of judgment does not prove that the races ought not to be ranked as species, but it shews that they graduate into each other, and that it is hardly possible to discover clear distinctive characters between them." (Descent of Man)<br>  <br>  It's pretty much of no use as to what this "race" debate is all about. It's an over-specification that orientates around a Sub-Sub species. The "race" that is of more use and is more exemplary in the world we are in today is that of the socially constructed one.|`|pfke6Jieaa	lol...u guys are so bent on saying arabs are mulattos. its funny when i post pictures and ask ppl do i look like a mulatto and i never get any answers. but when we tell the truth about the africans who mixed you act like you dont know what we are talking about. and u dont know how arabs look? lol......u r a hysterical person. <br>  <br>  if you notice no one else has anything against us except the blacks on here, including you. if you are that angry at me and middle easterns and other people for saying u r mixed then we are sorry. there is a saying in my culture that goes "a man without knowledge is a man of no respect" you figure out who this applies to. good day.|`|Uy58ixnvaa	According to science, they are Caucasoid.<br>  <br>  Native Americans, in case you were wondering, are Mongoloid.<br>  <br>  My question is, where do Hispanics fit in?<br>  <br>  Edit: Thanks, Choc1|`|v1JBAwSTaa	Middle Easterners have to mark tick the "White" box, They are mixture of Caucasoid, N*gro*d,Mongoloid, that's why some have coarse hair and some don't|`|eoxx8KKPaa	Caucasoid.<br>  <br>  That is how I view from an east asian point of view.|`|91fcc8b613eebc31050dad00a0ce0943aa	they just look arab to me|`|0KR4wyoQaa	Middle Easterns/Arabs are Caucasians.|`|DfDss68haa	They don't becuase there is now such things as race. Marvin has a good answer. Technically they are considered Caucasoid but that term is really becoming very stupid and a way to claim successes of Black people IMO.|`|0rDDPTi5aa	I personally think that the modern day racial classifications are outdated, and really do not accurately describe people.  For example, the whole term "Caucasian" was only invented in the late 1700's, by someone named Johann Blumenbach who discovered a skull in the Caucasus mountains, and from then on, people that fall into certain measurements are considered "Caucasian".  This link explains more: <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/johann-friedrich-blumenbach" rel="nofollow">http://www.answers.com/topic/johann-frie...</a><br>   There are problems with this, because many people defy these categories.  <br>  <br>  Think about the Micronesian or Polynesian people, or even Dravidians of India, most cannot specify where these people should fit into, so it seems to me that everything needs to be reworked.  In America, many times the expression Caucasian does mean the white race, which only adds to the confusion.<br>  <br>  I have noticed that most people of Arabic descent feel they are Caucasoid, but not white like European white, but Semitic white.|`|UhtSE2B6aa	@ Paralyzer,<br>  <br>  Hispanics are Caucasoid.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	well since the middle east is in asia i would consider middle easterners south asian.<br>  <br>  uhh...|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	People in that region have been mixing for centuries, they have all three ancestries actually.

NNvcd5Bhaa	its going to be difficult but you have to remember that YOU are the final authority in the classroom and you will need to act like it. Therefore when he acts up you will need to be tireless in your response which should be something like this. <br>  "Zac, you have a choice, you can either do what the rest of the class is doing or you can go sit in the naughty corner facing the wall. Which one do you want to do?" <br>  <br>  If you dont have a corner, just put his nose to the wall. If he wont stay there, you just have to keep physically putting him back to the wall with NO talking from you. It may take 10 or 20 times, which will take your time away from the class, but it something you must do. <br>  <br>  If he winds up participating, great, but he must still adhere to the same rules as everyone else, like sitting up, being quiet, or the same punishment applies. <br>  <br>  If dealing with him takes so much of your time that you cannot teach the class, then you should ask one of his parents to please stay in the next class to help you control him, because it is not fair to the other students who actually want to participate. <br>  <br>  If the parent continues to let him be disruptive, then you need to speak with someone higher up, or some church elders to get the parents straight on biblical parenting.

One is the Book of the Universe, a jot of whose testimony we have heard from the thirteen Flashes together with the Thirteenth Word of the Risale-i Nur. Another is the Seal of the Prophets (Upon whom be blessings and peace), the supreme sign of the Book of the Universe. Now, we must become acquainted with the Seal of the Prophets {Upon whom be blessings and peace), who is the second and Articulate Proof, and must listen to him. <br>  <br>  Indeed, look at the collective personality of this proof: the face of the earth has become his mosque, Mecca, his mihrab, and Medina, his pulpit. Our Prophet (Peace and blessings be upon him}, this clear proof, is leader to all the believers, preacher to all mankind, the chief of all the prophets, lord of all the saints, the leader of a circle for the remembrance of God comprising all the prophets and saints. He is a luminous tree whose living roots are all the prophets, and fresh fruits are all the saints; whose claims all the prophets relying on their miracles and all the saints relying on their wonderworking confirm and corroborate. For he declares and claims: There is no god but God! And all on left and right, that is, those luminous reciters of God's Names lined up in the past and the future, repeat the same words, and through their consensus in effect declare: "You speak the truth and what you say is right!" What false idea has the power to meddle in a claim which is thus affirmed and corroborated by thousands?<br>  <br>  · SECOND DROPLET <br>  <br>  ................<br>  <br>  The Nineteenth Letter<br>  <br>  THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED (PBUH)<br>  <br>  The Miracles of Muhammed (PBUH)<br>  <br>  In His Name, be He glorified!<br>  <br>  And there is nothing but it glorifies Him with praise.<br>  <br>  In the Name of the God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. <br>  He it is Who has sent His Prophet with guidance and the religion of truth to make it supreme over all religion: and sufficient is God as a Witness. * Muhammed is the Prophet of God... [to the end of the verse] <br>  {Qur'an, 48:28-9} <br>  <br>  <br>  [Since the Nineteenth and Thirty-First Words concerning the prophethood of Muhammed (Upon whom be blessings and peace) prove it with decisive evidence, we assign the verification of that side of the subject to those Words. As a supplement to them we will merely show here, in Ninenteenth Signs, some of the flashes of that great truth.]<br>  <br>  FIRST SIGN:<br>  The Owner and Master of this universe does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that are apparent to us. Since the One who creates knows, surely the One who knows will speak, since He will speak, surely He will speak to those who have consciousness, thought, and speech. Since He will speak to those who have thought, surely He will speak to humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more comprehensive of all conscious beings. Since He will speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity, renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in their hearts. <br>  <br>  Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW), and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He has done so. <br>  <br>  SECOND SIGN:<br>  <br>  ..........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nur.gen.tr/ar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nur.gen.tr/ar.html</a>

THE ONLY THING YOU WOULD HAVE TO FACE IS REJECTION AND I KNOW ITS SCARY BUT YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF KNOWING NOW IF SHE FEELS THE SAME WAY OR DOESN'T. IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THESE FEELINGS AND WASTING YOUR TIME WITH THEM. IF YOU KNOW SHE DOESN'T FEEL SAME WAY THEN AT LEAST YOU CAN MOVE ON AND FIND SOMEONE WHO DOES.

WEM5n41Oaa	I am good at this.  I do it all the time.  To practice a gentle spirit you need to be sensitive towards others.  Be gentle to others by being in tune with them.  It's different with each person because some people might want you to be more loud spoken with them.  Just be gentle in your conversations with people.  No rude or harsh speaking.  <br>  <br>  A quiet spirit is the easiest for me to practice.  The bible says "be still and know that I am God."  So read your bible to quiet your spirit or else just sit down and pray to God.  You can just sit and be with God.  A quiet spirit is a spirit that is calmed and slowed down.  So find a way to relax yourself.  I usually just sit and think.  Once I get things off my mind my spirit quiets down.|`|lQBHceP9aa	Sit, Breath, repeat.<br>  <br>  If you're Christian you could try the 'Jesus Prayer' from the Eastern Orthodox tradition.

We will choose our next evolutionary step. This is not God's fear, its what He built us for.

dQmFoRRiaa	The truth lives on the boundary of your life, taunting you and beckoning you.  The truth is everything you believe, and everything you don't. The truth is a whirling wheel and the point of perfect stillness -- you -- at its center.  The truth will cradle your heart, and devour it. The truth will feed your spirit, and break it.  The truth is the world as it is, and the world as it should be.  The truth is who you wish you could be and who you are. The truth is that you are unlimited, but finite, that you were born to live, and to die, that the world is a bright realm of aspiration and the yawning pit you are standing beside every second but can't see; the truth is everywhere, yet no man possesses it.  The truth is that life is not understood until it is seen through a veil of tears.  Now, I don't know if that's what you wanted to hear, but son, it's the truth.|`|WdAuncq9aa	The only way to heaven<br>  <br>  if you really want to go to haven I will show you the way  <br>  <br>  believe in one God the absolute  ,No 3 in 1 or Trinity  or cross or crescent  or idols or statues . <br>  believing in all the prophets of God , Moses Jesus, Mohammad (peace be on up them all).<br>  believe in his books and angels.<br>  believing in heaven and hell. <br>  believing the day of judgment or the day of resurrection <br>  believing in the destiny good  or bad and it is  all comes from Allah.<br>  <br>  Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe. (125)<br>  <br>  Islam is peace <br>  <br>  ? The word "Islam" is closely related to the word "salam or silm" which means peace. Muhammad, sallallahu alayhe wa sallam, himself had a very peaceful nature, was extremely tolerant, and highly protective of the non-Muslim minorities living in the Muslim state.<br>  <br>  However, there are times when states find war inevitable, but Islam only permits war in specific and dire circumstances. It keeps warfare at a level of mercy and respect for the enemy that no other army has been able to reach. The Prophet sometimes had to fight for the mere survival of his people and message, but once their security was ensured, he immediately reverted to peace and diplomacy.<br>  <br>  There is a rigid code Muslims must abide by in deciding when they can fight and how the fighting should be conducted. War itself is despised, and is only a last-resort option when all other attempts at peace have been made.<br>  <br>  A Muslim is never allowed to initiate hostilities. "And fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but transgress not the limits. Surely, Allah likes not the transgressors." [2: 190].<br>  <br>  The only times in which believers are allowed to take up arms are when they are defending their own lives and the lives of their people, when they see the weak being oppressed in acts of tyranny, and when they are prohibited from practicing their religion:<br>  <br>  "And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers." [2: 191].<br>  <br>  "They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso be cometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter, Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein," [2:217].<br>  <br>  Aside from these circumstances, there is no legitimate fighting in Islam.<br>  <br>  The conditions placed upon the soldier in battle are of utmost respect for the enemy and for human life. Islam makes a clear distinction between combatants and noncombatants, forbidding soldiers to harm defenseless civilian in any way. The Prophet said: "Do not kill the women, children, aged or the ill." He also prohibited Muslims from harming monks in their monasteries or hermits in their caves. Cutting down trees, destroying livestock, wells, homes or land of the enemy is likewise forbidden. Upon seeing the corpse of a woman in a battlefield, Prophet Muhammad asked his companions why she had been killed, and condemned it.<br>  <br>  There is no excuse for any expedition or attack resulting in the killing of civilians, no one has the right to take innocent lives.<br>  <br>  For those enemies active in combat and those taken prisoner of war, the list of rights is lengthy. There is no torture, no killing of the wounded or defenseless, and the return of corpses to the enemy is honored. There is no mutilation of the enemy bodies. Even after Hind bint Utbah, a powerful lady of Makkah, chewed the liver of the Prophet's uncle, Hamzah, after he was killed in a battle between Muhammad and her non-Muslim people, Muhammad still forbade his men from disrespecting a creation of God in such a way<br>  <br>  The Prophet commanded the believers to treat the prisoners of war with kindness. One prisoner by the name of Abu Aziz told how surprised he was to see the Muslims giving the better part of their meal-the bread-to the prisoners while they themselves just had dates. "Not a crumb of bread would fall into their hands without them giving it to me," he narrated, "and I would be so embarrassed that I would reject it. But then they would return it back to me."<br>  <br>  The Qur'a|`|oVHFz52Laa	Whoever has true Jesus has the Truth<br>  <br>  Jesus is the Truth and the Way and the Eternal Life|`|8qctM0B4aa	you cant handle the truth|`|saDjgQkxaa	I'll give you a hint.

Imam Malik replied: "Difference in languages, difference in pitches of voice, difference in singing are proof that Allah (subhanahu wa ta`ala) exists!"<br>  <br>  3rd:<br>  <br>  The same question was asked, by an atheist, of Imam Abu Hanifa and he replied, "Forget it! At the moment, I am busy thinking about this ship. People tell me there is a big ship, it contains different goods on board. There is no one to steer it, no one maintaining it. Yet, this ship keeps going back and forth; it even traverses big waves on the oceans; it stops at the locations that it is supposed to stop at; it continues in the direction that it is supposed to head. This ship has no<br>  captain and no one planning its trips."<br>  <br>  The atheist who posed the question interrupted and exclaimed, "What kind of strange and silly thought is this? How can any intelligent person think that some thing like this can occur?"<br>  <br>  Imam Abu Hanifa said, "I feel sorry about your state! You cannot imagine one ship running without some one looking after its affairs. Yet you think that for this whole world, which runs exactly and precisely, there is no one who looks after it, and no one owns it." <br>  <br>  Hearing the reply, the atheist was left speechless but he found out more about Haqq (The Truth) and proclaimed Islam.<br>  <br>  4th:<br>  <br>  Imam Shafi`i replied to the question in the following way, "The leaves of Toot (berries) are all but one. Each leaf tastes exactly the same. Insects, honey bees, cows, goats, and deer live off of it. After eating these the insects produce silk; bees produce honey; deer give musk (a special kind of scent), cows and goats deliver off-springs. Is this not clear evidence that one kind of leaf has so many qualities, and who created these qualities? It is the Khaliq (Creator) who we call Allah (subhanahu wa ta`ala) Who is the Inventor and the Creator."<br>  <br>  May Allah guide all of us through the right path.|`|FK9Z75Staa	The truth is the Kool-Aid man.

P544Sbmqaa	In my relationship, its actually him that has a hard time talking about.  I dont think you can make a blanket statement about which gender has it easier talking about sex.  Rather it depends on your own personal thoughts and ideals about sex.<br>  <br>  My spouse and I know more or less the majority of each other's histories.  I think its a personal decision on how much to share.  Sometimes, some things are better left unsaid, but those things are different from couple to couple.  <br>  <br>  As far as fantasies, I think its definatly important to be completly open about what you want and as open as you can be about fullfilling fantasies.  Im not proud of it, but when I was younger I was quite promiscuis and slept with several married men.  With every single one of them, the marriage had been over long before I came around, but what I learned is that a large part of the marriage falling apart was the inability to be sexually open with their spouse for one reason or another about their fantasies or desires.|`|AtY7izyHaa	If life has taught me any thing about women<br>  <br>  ironically it's been the women themselves,<br>  <br>  who have taught it to me, what better way<br>  <br>  to learn about the teacher, than to attend<br>  <br>  her class . . .

(The Mormon Kingdom, vol.1, p.138) However this may be, in another portion of the ceremony (Mormonism--Shadow or Reality? p. 468), it is explained that "Pay lay ale" means "O God, hear the words of my mouth!" In the early 1980's some critics of the church began to proclaim that in Hebrew these words really mean, "Wonderful Lucifer." If this were true, this would mean that the Mormons were praying to the Devil in this part of the ceremony. We took very strong exception to this claim and pointed out that there is no way that these words can be translated "Wonderful Lucifer." We still stand by this research which we presented in detail in our book, The Lucifer-God Doctrine, pp. 11-15, 85-86. <br>  <br>  In any case, many Mormons must have been bothered when they had to raise and lower their hands repeating the strange words "Pay lay ale" three times during the ritual. According to what we can learn, the Mormon leaders have now replaced the mysterious words with the English words which were mentioned earlier in the ceremony: "O God, hear the words of my mouth!" The fact that four different versions of the sign of the Second Token of the Melchizedek Priesthood have been given over the years certainly raises a question concerning the claim that the endowment was revealed by revelation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:q3Zhj7v3AkcJ:www.mazeministry.com/resources/books/doombook/templechanges.htm+pay+lay+ale+removed+from+the+temple+ceremonie&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=4&gl=us" rel="nofollow">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:q3Zh...</a>|`|NU06LUUXaa	The First Presidency told us not to anymore. <br>  <br>  I'm surprised that you couldn't come to that conclusion on your own.

But too often they think (incorrectly) that what makes THEM happy must be something that would make me happy, too.<br>  <br>  They forget that most important rule that I learned when being raised Methodist:  You must make Jesus your personal savior.  The pushy religious types can't understand that I've said, categorically, NO.  They don't understand NO.  So their happiness becomes my irritation and sadness and eventually anger when they don't shut up with the constant preaching.  Further, if they got me to say OK I BELIEVE just to get rid of them, then they collaborated in essentially a lie to God.

In fact, most hobbies and pastimes are either an escape from reality or some sort of distraction from it. I think coexistence and tolerance of religion is perfectly acceptable to most atheists. The conflicts lie in public policy or intolerance towards atheists. Vociferous individuals like Bill Maher and Richard Dawkins sell movies and books because they push for "tension," (to borrow a term from MLK Jr.).|`|quN4DCGWaa	Drugs make people happy too. what's the problem with drugs then???|`|zfUpf50paa	Nothing if it actually does make them happier .

DhgU7x0Daa	:) I wondered why I saw this again. Like I said before, I find African Americans classify biracial people as black as is reflected in black magazines and African American history books (lots of biracial/half white people's achievements credited to one race) and I'm sure they didn't interview them and find how they identify. Like you said, I think it's emotion based rather than logical.|`|8IyZphFVaa	when you say "classify" someone on documents, what exactly are you getting at? people of different races tend to have different experiences that has nothing to do with their dna. i just don't understand what you mean about "miss-classification" and "medical dangers?" ppl do not classify themselves according to race based on dna. if you want to know your medical dangers, you look at your family history. we're all technically 99% the same genetically.<br>  and when it comes to history, most people identify with their or their parent's nation's/culture's history. in the US you don't have american history. you have american history and african-american history and hispanic-american history. the american experience is and has always been different based on the way you look, so what do you mean when you say "false claim to another race and history?"<br>  i kind of get where you are going with this but i don't think you are acknowledging why our societies are the way they are in the first place. it has nothing to do with dna or any kind of logic.|`|fusc1cykaa	I apologize for not reading thoroughly but I can say if you look black society is gonna think your black, you look white same thing, you look like a latino same thing, etc. Doesn't matter if you are a white girl if you look latina your gonna be called latina.<br>  <br>  Or if you looked mixed you look mixed.
LXD59ocbaa	No.|`|mSt1LGfjaa	i am so sorry to hear ll that, i can imagine how upset you are. when my mom and dad died i was angry with God,,i tried to understand it all,,then i came to my senses and realize there was a God cause i had a real bad car wreck and i should have died,they had to cut me out of the car and i had a few broken bones and crack my neck,but i am still here cause it want my time to go,we cant explain why all the bad happens unless he want us to reach out to him and to learn to start praying andbelievingg in him,please dot be mad i bet if you pray things will get better and he will answer your prayers, we all have a choice to believe or not too,it is your choice,but i will pray for your loved ones for you and for you too,|`|ridu0Rtwaa	The first person to provide a shred of verifiable evidence for God will become world famous and mega rich!!  Ain't happened yet and it never will!!|`|7ylYxklsaa	Well, my parents got divorced when I was 13, then my dad died in a car accident when I was 14. My mom married a jerk who emotionally abused my sister, my mom, and me for the last four years. I've had my own car for nearly a year and have been hit four times already. <br>  <br>  I can just barely pay my rent, and it's really tough to work full time and go to school full time as it is, so now I might have to work even more.<br>  <br>  But I'm actually very happy and satisfied with my life, despite all of the crap that happens. Everyone has their burdens, and you shouldn't expect life to be a happy-go-lucky frolic in the meadow. <br>  <br>  Spend as much time as you can with your dad. Everyone dies, but be thankful that you have the time to say goodbye. <br>  <br>  When my father died, I had been in an argument with him, and there's not a day that goes by that I don't wish that the last thing I had said to him could have been that I loved him. There are many days I would give anything for a single day where I could see him again. You have the chance to say goodbye the right way.|`|CjJKUMl8aa	Well, certain accident occurs either cause by human mistakes or they forgotten to check their car condition. Well, sorry to hear this.

They dont hate all people just because of the color of their skin, only some.  They enjoy Germans, as they enjoy English, and they are both white by definition.<br>  <br>  EDIT - If you were asking if people knew what skinheads were...then why didnt you just say that?  Rather than be rude to people, when they maybe just obviously dont know.<br>  <br>  I obviously think it because it is deemed to be shown in a light that portrays them as that.  From what I was aware, skinhead was a name given to a british subculture in the 20th century, which is what I was taught in college.|`|fusc1cykaa	To my knowledge skinhead means -racist white person. So the definition saids it.|`|DQZK3eKfaa	because they are. <br>  Wow. You've reached a new low.|`|hQ7oLzH9aa	I think they actually are, maybe thats why.<br>  <br>  just a guess *sarcasm|`|z2ClkOa4aa	Because this is what the media portrays. It is what sells the papers, grab headlines, and takes sweeps week. People are unaware that the original skinheads were non racist/non political, and were more interested in soccer, scooters, and ska. These same people also don't care about learning the real history either.

5f5e536951c9ab9a35b76b038514f369aa	I wont stay with a guy who abuse me. No way! Thats why im always independent and always save money and make sure i dun get stuck in a situation where i have to depend on him for financial reason. I would not stay with him for the children's sake either. But I dun think its women's fault for staying with the guys. Some people are just not as independant as us or they have their reasons like i mentioned above.|`|4m3z1ztEaa	I am a man<br>  I can't<br>  The only reason I think people forgive is because of the pressure from family and society|`|dX4Dll0yaa	Well, you don't. I will never forgive the man who abused me. The hardest thing was forgiving myself for letting it keep going. I did keep going back. I did that because I got used to it. That was the way I thought it was supposed to be. I thought that it was all my fault, and if I was a better girlfriend maybe the abuse would end (thankfully, he did not hit me much, but the other abuse was more than enough). Also, it can be incredibly dangerous to leave. It is much more complicated than you can imagine. After being told everything is your fault for years, where is your self-esteem, you confidence, you ability to move on? I am still rebuilding years later.<br>  It is never the victim's fault - period.|`|zBw8qrASaa	Well some women stay for the fear of not being able to support themselves and their children so they stay and take it. It's not the love there its the financial security. And others stay because they believe their is no one out htere to love them for they hae been mentally abuse into thinking this way.Then their are those who look for that kind of attention because growing up thats all they knew. Then the innocent who were it didn't start like that and they can't believe they fell into this type of relationship and they love the man and they think it will change so they hang around it making up excuses for it. .........There is no right in any of these situations by no means but the answers are harder to find especially if we are not in that kind of relationship! It makes us angry.I seen things on tv that wold make mekick a mans azz if he evr did some of those things to me .i'd kill him really! but i don't think they stay to keep getting abused i think they are brain washed either by the man or themselves ino thinkin it will stop or it wasn't meant to happen and it will change you and i know it won't but they can't see it....some do as time goes on some don't or they continue in that relationship until something terrible happens!  me im out and if he hurts me im coming back at him.if not by fist with something dammit......we gonna bleed together! and im out!

eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	There are zombie legends from Africa, I had a book with supernatural stories from around the world and a couple of stories involved vodoo rituals in Africa.  The traditional Vodoo zombie is someone who's drugged, not returned from the dead, although the drug makes you miserable, feeling like you're dead.  Suggestion is a powerful tool when you're not feeling so hot.<br>  <br>  Hollywood's trying to make you fear 'Big Brother' with the chemical/biological warfare and virus releated zombie stories.|`|xOduTscPaa	yes therer are derived from haiti mostly and are mentioned in haitian folklore as mindlsaves who worked for witchdoctors by voodoo and chemical poisons. there was a case in 1962 involving a missing man named Clairvius Narcisse who was poisoned by a haitian witchdoctor by tetrodotoxin a deadly chemical that comes from a japanese puffer fish. The sodium channels in your blood are drastically reduced and blocked and this along with a poisonous toad extract put this person to the brink of death that fooled sciemntists and doctors. They marked him as dead but he was still moving around. he was braindead in a way clouded but still walking and moving around. His heartrate was so low he couldnt technically be alive but he was.  He and other poisoned "zombies" were forced to work for him until the witch doctore died mysteriously in 1964 and the toxin eventually weared off and he told his story. there is a book called the serpent and the rainbow if your interested it gives the full facts i have not yet read it but im trying to get my hands on it. its by Wade Davis I hope you enjoy.|`|BvY47ts6aa	Yes. Haiti to be exact. The original myth involved the practice of voodoo (black magic the African way), which is somewhat outdated for our modern way of acceptance. So the version involving chemicals and biological agents is more appealing.|`|wbgqfqrqaa	Yes because some would say that the gods would curse them and they are to evil and some say that Nuclar stuff could make you do that zombie stuff|`|B7aRbZRTaa	I think perhaps from Haitians of african decent combined with some western religious beliefs.  just a guess .|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Zombies come from the voudoo practices of Haiti. There are concoctions that cause paralyzayion which lead to coma states. This lead to the zombie myth & coming back from the dead. <br>  <br>  I'm not aware of stories w/chemical warfare making zombies, but the comparison could be made w/the chemical ingredients themselves. If specific chemicals were included in the weapons (either natural or synthesized), they could cause the same zombie-like symptoms.

We know what's in the Bible, and we like it.|`|IiWz11Kraa	I have read the whole bible, and I found nothing to be shameful about.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	This Christian has read the entire Bible from start to finish a few times. However, I do wish I was like an elderly neighbor I had when I was growing up. His knowledge of the Bible was such that he could take any version of the Bible handed to him and open it to within one page of any verse he was asked about. I have no doubt that he could have quoted the Bible verbatim if asked. And he lived his life as the Bible said to.<br>  <br>  It would be nice if all Christians could do that. I know of a few that only read the scripture they're told to by their pastors, ministers, etc. and feel that that is all they need to do. And if I know a few, then there must be many more.<br>  <br>  And, there is nothing in the Bible to be ashamed or embarrassed about.

Morality changes as time goes by but the bible does not. Many things that were written in the bible 2000 years ago simply are not valid by todays standards. A few examples:<br>  <br>  Slavery- The bible does not speak out against slavery. In fact the bible considers slavery as normal and says that if you are a slave, you must be hard working and obedient to your master.<br>  <br>  Women- The bible says that woman is the property of man and she must not disobey him.<br>  <br>  Child Abuse- The bible says we must not "spare the rod" against our children. <br>  <br>  Birth Control- 2000 years ago this was a non issue, however in this day and age, with overpopulation and dwindling rescources for everyone, birth control should be advocated not discouraged.<br>  <br>  This is only a short list.

BgU3WEWUaa	Well after Jesus ascended up to heaven his Holy Spirit fell upon the disciples so they were speaking in tongues he also ask them to go unto the world and spead the teachings that he has taught to them and to bless others in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit!!  <br>  <br>  The people were saved the same way that we can be saved today...by asking Jesus into our hearts and proclaiming him to be our Lord and Savior like he said in Matthew 10:32 and 33 <br>  <br>   “Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven. But whoever denies Me before men, him I will also deny before My Father who is in heaven."<br>  <br>  and YES their lives changed trumenduously because now they had Jesus in their hearts and if they followed his teachings like " love thy neighbor as thy self" and others then on judgement day they could enter heaven hearing the words *welcome Home*!!! Matthew 25:34-40 says<br>  <br>  Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:  for I was hungry and you gave Me food; I was thirsty and you gave Me drink; I was a stranger and you took Me in; I was naked and you clothed Me; I was sick and you visited Me; I was in prison and you came to Me.’ “Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungry and feed You, or thirsty and give You drink? When did we see You a stranger and take You in, or naked and clothe You? Or when did we see You sick, or in prison, and come to You?’ And the King will answer and say to them, ‘Assuredly, I say to you, inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me.’ <br>   <br>  So it wasn't just simply easier to get into heaven we still have to do our part but because Jesus died on the cross for all the sins that humanity did then he gave us back the choice to choose God and do right so we can have our enternity in heaven or choose evil and go to hell!!!<br>  <br>  I really hope this helps  :) and heres a couple verses I think might help more.....|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) What happened after Jesus left us, according to the Bible?<br>  <br>  Bunches of stuff.

"How" is an odd and complicated question - but the over-simple answer is that they believed that Jesus died for their sins, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) was it just easier to get into heaven or did their lives change?<br>  <br>  Both.  Prior to that, with the possible exception of Enoch, it was probably *impossible* to get into heaven.  Jesus is called "the firstborn from the dead".  Also:  their lives changed.

We are all given trials which are to help refine us like gold is refined in the fires, so that we can grow to be more like our Lord and less like the people of the world who do not know or care to know about our Lord.

The Blood was for our sins that we committed and the Cross is for our sin-full nature. Jesus said that no thief or murderer can enter the gates of heaven. <br>  <br>  If you stole something and went to court and the judge found you guilty. Then some one come and says I will take the penalty for you. You would be grateful but would that stop you from stilling again? No, also what would make everyone not look at you as a thief? In order for those people look at you as a thief you would have to die. That is what the cross is for, to kill your nature. <br>  <br>  Then Christ risen on the third day so that you to may have a new nature, a nature of God. Imagine having God's nature, it would be a life without sin. This is what Jesus means "You must be born again"(John 3:3). How can something old be something new or in other words How can a old life that is dead live in a new life? It can't it is imposable.<br>  <br>  The meaning of baptism is Death Burial and Resurrection (Romans 6:3-7).

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years.

ridu0Rtwaa	Easter is set by the first full moon after the vernal equinox. This is the one day in the year when day and night are roughly equal!<br>  <br>  It varies by more than a month over the years and so it simply cannot represent the date of anyone's death!!!<br>  <br>  It is in fact a combination of several pagan festivals most notably the spring festival.<br>  <br>  The name Easter comes from “Eastre” an Anglo-Saxon pagan goddess. Also the Norse goddess,Ostara who took her name from the Teutonic lunar goddess Eostre<br>  <br>  Even the Chinese have the festival of Ching Ming where flowers and sweets are put on their ancestors graves!!<br>  <br>  The egg and the rabbit are symbols of springtime and rebirth along with the custom of giving flowers etc!!<br>  <br>  The Venerable Bede, an early Christian writer pointed out that the Christian church absorbed Pagan practices when it found the population unwilling to give up the festivals.  Thus a lot of what Christians now see as Christians practices are in fact pagan!!!<br>  <br>  Fun to watch the Christians worshiping a pagan festival though - makes it just like Christmas when they do the same thing!!!<br>  <br>  There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!<br>  <br>  He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?<br>  <br>  Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!<br>   <br>  Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!<br>  <br>  At best he was an amalgam of those others!!|`|r7Vhc9zNaa	1.

I'm not Catholic so I don't know about Lent enough to answer. The customs of Easter started back before the time of Christ. It was a fertility ritual of Roman times, that is why the "Easter Bunny" and the color eggs are part of Easter. Having eggs to be fertilized increases a woman changes to bear children and the rabbit(like most rodents) is known for producing frequent offsprings.|`|FvoxgjbJaa	Forty has significance beginning with the time when Moses sent forty individuals to size up the opposition when the Israelite nation was preparing to enter it's new promised land...a land flowing with mild and honey.<br>  These spies  whose number was twelve spent forty days spying on the land of Chanaan. Coming back to Moses and the Israelites they testified that the land was indeed good but they despaired of being able to overcome its inhabitants, some of whom were giants. Only Josue and Caleb were confident in the abilities of the Israelites to overcome the immoral inhabitants of Chanaan; knowing that God was on their side.<br>  But the ten dissenters caused the majority of the Israelites to murmur against God and Moses. As a punishment for this the Israelites would wander in the desert forty years and all those twenty years and up would perish in the desert. The only exceptions were Caleb and Josue who would enter the promised land. Even Moses did not enter it but neither did he perish in the desert.<br>  Hence this is the reason why Jesus spent forty days fasting in the desert. Moses and Elias also had spent forty days fasting in the desert and that is why in the Transfiguration of the Lord, Moses and Elias appeared with Him.<br>  Our Lord died at three o'clock on Good Friday and rose from the dead at seven o'clock in the morning on Easter Sunday; He was dead forty hours. When He rose from the dead He spent forty days on earth. The Ascension day is a Thursday and is the fortieth day following Easter Sunday to commemorate our Lord's ascension into Heaven.<br>  Forty is also the number of lashes that Israelites would dole out to persons guilty of certain crimes. However because of the faithfulness of Josue and Caleb the lashes were reduced by one so the 40 lashes became 39 lashes.<br>  During Lent Catholics fast and abstain forty days from Ash Wednesday to noon of Holy Saturday. All Sundays are feast days and are never days of fast or abstinence. <br>  For more information on the days from Ash Wednesday to Easter Sunday click on the link below which will take you to a calendar outlining each day of the Lenten Season.|`|fovMmVBYaa	Open your Bible and read the first four Gospels in the new testament.

NWa45ZDIaa	I really like the scripture you quoted, that definitely makes the point. Here's a couple more scriptures:<br>  <br>  Exodus 20:13 "You must not murder."<br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22,23 "And in case men should struggle with each other and they really hurt a pregnant woman and her children do come out but no fatal accident occurs, he is to have damages imposed upon him without fail according to what the owner of the woman may lay upon him; and he must give it through the justices. But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul" This scripture shows the importance of a life is to God, even an unborn one.<br>  <br>  Psalms 149:14-16 is along the lines you quoted: "I shall laud you because in a fear-inspiring way I am wonderfully made. Your works are wonderful, As my soul is very well aware. My bones were not hidden from you. When I was made in secret, When I was woven in the lowest parts of the earth. Your eyes saw even the embryo of me, And in your book all its parts were down in writing, As regards the days when they were formed. And there was not yet one among them."|`|7ylYxklsaa	Your belief and religion in general has no place in an academic paper. Your teacher will have every right to take points off for that. <br>  <br>  Your belief might matter, but you must understand what the appropriate forum is, and you obviously don't.|`|1g49KgoGaa	It's unconstitutional to make abortion illegal because you can't control what women do with their bodies.<br>  Have you ever been put in the position where you were raped and got pregnant as a result?  Didn't think so.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Unless you live in a Christian theocracy, the Bible is irrelevant to what should or should not be legal. We cannot legislate morality. Making abortion illegal will not make it stop, only make it more dangerous. Jane cannot seriously expect a  woman who has been a victim of a crime as violent as rape to marry her attacker, then what? Live happily ever after? That is just sick! No wonder atheists think Christians are stupid. Use a bit of common sense once in a while. God bless.|`|564f663bd843bf78848130c65ab50bd6aa	Revelation 2:23 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts: and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.|`|xTriyfWuaa	how about gods curse to kill all the first born of egypt?<br>  oh... no... that doesn't really help now does it?|`|muHctmaGaa	Who knows if God is, but the Bible as written is pro-choice. The Bible doesn't recognize the fetus as equivalent to living humans, so any references to murder cannot apply. <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 6:3-6 -- "A man may have a hundred children and live many years; yet no matter how long he lives, if he cannot enjoy his prosperity and does not receive proper burial, I say that a stillborn child is better off than he. It comes without meaning, it departs in darkness, and in darkness its name is shrouded. Though it never saw the sun or knew anything, it has more rest than does that man- even if he lives a thousand years twice over but fails to enjoy his prosperity. Do not all go to the same place?"<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 4:3 -- But better off than both of them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun." <br>  <br>  Job 10:18-19 -- "Why then hast Thou brought me out of the womb? Would that I had died and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been, carried from womb to tomb." <br>  <br>  Exodus 21:22-25 -- "And if men struggle and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage, yet there is no further injury, he shall be fined as the woman's husband may demand of him, and he shall pay as the judges decide. But if there is any further injury, then you shall appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."|`|VQmHIrStaa	Hosea 9:11-16 Hosea prays for God’s intervention.  “Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.  Give them, 0 Lord: what wilt thou give?  Give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. . .Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit: yea though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb.”  Clearly Hosea desires that the people of Ephraim can no longer have children.  God of course obeys by making all their unborn children miscarry.  Is not terminating a pregnancy unnaturally “abortion?"<br>  <br>  Numbers 31:17 (Moses) “Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every women that hath known man by lying with him.”  In other words: women that might be pregnant, which clearly is abortion for the fetus.<br>  <br>  1 Samuel 15:3 God commands the death of helpless "suckling" infants.  This literally means that the children god killed were still nursing.<br>  <br>  Psalms 135:8 & 136:10 Here god is praised for slaughtering little babies.<br>  <br>  Psalms 137:9 Here god commands that infants should be “dashed upon the rocks”.|`|Wn64Oxxyaa	So you have made up your mind and are now looking for biblical evidence to judge others?

No absolutely not.  if anything God is pro-life.|`|KBzDedgvaa	Because the Bible is such a factual textbook, right?|`|EfIXhZdqaa	There are none. The bible doesn't talk about abortion, because God is pro-choice.
oVHFz52Laa	I am sure it does. However, I do not care. The Old Testament is the same it was at the time of jesus and He confirmed it. They di not see God among them ( Immanuel = God with us ), Why should I care if they are upset. I am not saying they killed jesus because it was part of the plan, but they still keep rejecting Him. They are waiting for their Messiah|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: usually the eyes tend to roll, like when reading Mina's answer.  They've heard it all before.  What gets irritating is when Christians tell Jews that they don't understand their own language and writings, that they got it wrong for 2,000 years until Christians came along to explain it to them and then wonder why Jews  (and others) think some Christians are arrogant and intolerant. Mostly it's usually just frustration.<br>  <br>  Christians who really push or use deceptive tactics to try and convince Jews to convert do get a harsher reaction, justifiably so.<br>  <br>  # # #<br>  <br>  gurgles - read a history book. The "trial" never happened, Pilate didn't cave into Jewish leaders and Jewish leaders never plotted to have Jesus killed.|`|a7IHVTNZaa	I'm sure it does upset the Jewish believers that the Tanakh is used  as a reference only and not as a guide to live by.<br>  <br>  For a long time after I became a Messianic believer (following the Torah and believing in Yahshua HaMashiach) I didn't understand the full difference in Yahshua and Jesus. I understand the difference now.<br>  The Jews know that the Messiah wasn't born in the dead of winter. They also know that the true Messiah would never do away with the Torah.<br>  When a Christian tells a Jewish person that they are believers in Jesus, they are saying that they believe in the "lawless one", (after all, don't they claim that the law was nailed to the cross?) most Jews know who that is...<br>  <br>  You are correct that Jesus doesn't fit the Tanakh. The Messiah Yahshua is the living Torah and would never change any aspect of it.|`|FK9Z75Staa	I don't care. I believe us Jews can believe in the Torah and reject the new testament, I believe christians can believe in both, I believe Hindus can believe in the Vedas and what not and I believe Pastafarians can believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. <br>  <br>  Although I certainly don't represent the whole population of Jews, I can be certain that most Jews don't care.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Most of the Jews I know know that the Christians are wrong, shrug, and move on.<br>  <br>  It's not worth getting upset over or fighting with those who choose to mistranslate and misinterpret the Tanakh as the Christians do.
vUujtivhaa	Well after watching  the video.  i now realize it's  wrong  to call someone gay when that person is not gay. so next time i should be careful in choosing  my words carefully.  to make sure i don't hurt somebody feelings because that's not nice|`|pVbTFgPuaa	exactly..

2GK3mBeuaa	1. Who do you worship and what does he/she represent? (Multiple answers obviously accepted)<br>  I honour the Norse Gods.  To name a few: Odin, Thor, Freya, Frigga, Eir, Sif, and Tyr.  Each of them is a separate and unique entity. To give you an idea, go to <a href="http://www.en.wikipeda.org/wiki/Odin" rel="nofollow">http://www.en.wikipeda.org/wiki/Odin</a> and see how long the page is just on Odin.  I honour them because they Called me.  <br>  <br>  <br>  2. What is the basis for your belief? <br>  My religion is the reconstruction of the beliefs and practices of pre-Christian Iceland, Germany, and nearby places.  Basically, the religion of the Vikings.  What we have preserved to base our beliefs off of is the notes Snorri (a Christian monk who found the religion fascinating and decided to record it.), preserved culture, and archeology.  <br>  <br>  Our moral and cultural structure is built around the Hávamál.  To sum it up in my own words: honour the Gods, the ancestors, others, and yourself.  Others like to equate the following 9 Noble Virtues with certain parts of the Hávamál: Courage, Truth, Honour, Fidelity, Discipline, Hospitality, Self-reliance, Industriousness, and Perseverance. <br>  <br>  <br>  3. What are your beliefs in regards to magick?<br>  Magic, in Heathenism, is a lot different than magic in other Pagan religions.  Ours is much more simple and to the point in my opinion.  Often runes will be used in our magic, the Gods will be asked to aid, and an offering is given to them.  The runes are the Elder Furthark.<br>  <br>  <br>  4. How is your religion/spirituality organized? (covens, for instance)<br>  We have a few national organizations, and perhaps some international ones.  The one I am most familiar with is The Troth.  <a href="http://www.thetroth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetroth.org</a> Its a rather large organization, I reccomend checking out the site for more info.  Within the larger organizations there are often kindreds or smaller groups of Heathens that meet up.  My kindred has about 8 or 9 people in it. <br>  <br>  A good intro book about what typically takes place at Blots and Sumbles (types of kindred gatherings) is Essential Asatru.  You can read the important parts for free from google books: <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=1uX-s1gSB5kC&dq=Book:+essential+asatru&printsec=frontcover&source=bn&hl=is&ei=KYuzSbHXJuPetged0_DEBw&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=4&ct=result" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=1uX-s1g...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  5. What motivated you to select this faith?<br>  Other Heathens on Yahoo!Answers actually.  I had found Wicca 5 years earlier, but for most of the time I considered myself Wiccan I realized Wicca wasn't for me.  I finally stumbled accross some Heathens here, did some research about the religion, and finally found my home.|`|knOdcrDkaa	1.  The universe, and it doesn't represent anything other than itself.<br>  <br>  2.  The universe has all the characteristics that others ascribe to their deities.  It is creator, destroyer and redeemer.  It is the Ultimate.<br>  <br>  3.  I have no skill in magic, but I'm sure it brings much inspiration to those so skilled.<br>  <br>  4.  Pantheists are scattered throughout religions and denominations, and there is no real organized structure.<br>  <br>  5.

But I believe a lot of things... it's hard to just put a theology in a nutshell. Specific questions would be helpful.|`|RxBe4y3Waa	i believe in:<br>  karma<br>  reincarnation<br>  and an understanding of and respect for nature and all living things<br>  (to make a long story short)|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	1. Who do you worship and what does he/she represent? (Multiple answers obviously accepted)<br>   I worship the gods of the Celtic people, but the majority of my worship goes to my patroness Aine, who is a goddess of war, love, and fertility. <br>  <br>  2. What is the basis for your belief?<br>  I'm not quite sure what the thrust of this question is. You mean what do I base it on? Personal experience including an NDE that provided unexplainable information, and modern science which agrees with Celtic cosmology.<br>  <br>  3. What are your beliefs in regards to magick?<br>  That you don't spell it with a k. Seriously thoough, I practise, but I consider that separate from my faith, as it should be, my Christian father practises as well, so I wouldn't call magic a pagan monopoly of any sort.<br>  4. How is your religion/spirituality organized? (covens, for instance)<br>  Usually it would be arranged in groups, if there were any large following of it, like groves, but for now, just with those, like me, who practise. <br>  <br>  5. What motivated you to select this faith?<br>  well, I started here, then went off to Christianity, which made me suicidal and depressed, then atheism, then after a bunch of stuff, including some college and a near-death experience, wended my way back. <br>  <br>  (Aine knocked me upside the head and scolded me properly, let's say.) After returning to the faith and going through multiple things that should have been medical impossibilities.|`|8DCslWmMaa	1. Who do you worship and what does he/she represent? (Multiple answers obviously accepted)<br>  I do not worship a he or she specifically, I worship all life be it a he or a she or something else. <br>  <br>  2. What is the basis for your belief?<br>  Nature & Love<br>  <br>  3. What are your beliefs in regards to magick?<br>  Magic is a natural thing.<br>  <br>  4. How is your religion/spirituality organized? (covens, for instance)<br>  While I am probably not the only one like me, I have no group or organization that I belong to really. I do like to get into places with open-minded people who can take about the same things. <br>  <br>  5. What motivated you to select this faith?<br>  It evolved naturally through my life. I was never made to go to church or anything like that so I explored life on my own.|`|cECRv4NMaa	Wicca ~ I believe that there is both Goddess(s) and God(s) in our life. I believe that we are here to protect the earth, and all on it. I believe that we can manipulate things as needed, but with in the rules. I believe that we are not all meant to follow the same beliefs or paths, but that there are many paths to salvation or heaven or what ever paradise you believe in. I believe we should take responsibility for our actions and not blame them on another person or thing. There is a lot more, but that is the basics. Sorry, missed a few... I am a solitary, magic is there to help, it is only good (or bad) depending on how you use it. I think I have always been Wiccan, but made it official after many years of research.|`|6B1sxgtOaa	Wica<br>  1. The Divine  expressed in the male and female but is androgynous.  <br>  <br>  2.  I know there is something  greater than us and do believe in "higher being"   I do not believe that a loving god would totally discard a whole sex of his creation because they were curious.  The devil is not in Wica, the evil devil is part of the Christian mythos.  I believe in reincarnation, it is a way for the soul to learn lessons and is neither good or bad just is.  It is lessons.  I believe what I send out comes back to me multiplied; good or bad.<br>  <br>  3. Magick is a natural process that must be learned by modern people because we have been taught that it does not exist but really the roots of magick is in quantum physics and science is just beginning to understand the power of the human mind and will.<br>  <br>  4.  More power in groups but better in smaller groups i.e. covens.  Closely working group but not so big as to cause strife and distance. Usually no more than 13.<br>  <br>  5.  I had no place as a female in the church except as a second class citizen.  In Wica we are representations of the Goddess and Men are representations of the God.  It is equal but separate.  I feel as though I am home.

A placebo only makes people THINK they feel better.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	A placebo is a fake pill, usually given during the double blind testing of a medication or, in the case of a person who is obsessive about medication.<br>  The idea is this tell a person in extreme pain that the pill you are giving him is the best, the strongest etc. with -in half an hour that person will express pain relief..he believes in the power of that pill, there really is nothing in the pill but sugar.  If the mind believes something ,then the body will follow through, it is a phenomena.<br>  What Dr. House is saying then is, religion is a fake pill, but the masses believe in it...  and so they feel better even though there is nothing there.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Funny.

But I don't think your dog will be considered bad: Rudotale was either old or in pain, or both. He may have been giving you signals to tell you that he hurt and didn't want to be fussed with. When you (and your mom and your boyfriend) didn't get the message, he resorted to the only signal you understood. Viewed through eyes of love this is not bad.

If you are bad (remember, you can't be good compared to God) all your life, you never choose to trust Jesus as your atoning sacrifice, and you never repent of your sins you will end up separated from God in the eternal lake of fire.<br>  <br>  My question is, what did you do to Rudotale that made him bite you?

They have to do this to protect their reputation and minimize public exposure due to lawsuits involving racism.  The problem is you can make policies and laws to enforce a certain behavior, but you can not change what is in a person’s heart.  Smart companies attack this problem on both fronts: they encourage employees with strong racial views to keep their opinions out of the work place; and, they help employees who are “sensitive” to become a little less insecure.<br>  <br>  How do they do this?  Well, they teach their employees that there is a difference between being a “racist” and being “racially insensitive.”  I don’t need to define what a racist is, but a person who is racially insensitive is someone who may make an off color comment and offend someone without even realizing it.  They just didn’t know what they said was offensive because they have not been exposed to other cultures enough to be aware of all the jargon and innuendo.  Of course, if someone is a repeat offender that argument will not hold.<br>  <br>  Bottom line, this planet belongs to all of us.  Regardless of our skin color and physical features we are all the same species, human.  We’ve made great strides, but the longer racial battles continue, the longer we must all endure the embarrassment of our collective ignorance on the subject.|`|GPznIhzMaa	There seems to be racists in every section, but they tend to gather mostly in this one and the Politics section.

I'd rather see you provide some real-world evidence for the last 3.  Take those "facts" away, and you've really just got someone whose mom or dad's a Muslim.|`|64d4893f2b5ad37e1908f80ec7b0c4c2aa	No, but I do believe he is going to run this country further into the ground, financially.|`|AA11883252	No, just a man.|`|AA11152153	I will answer your question if you show me where in the Bible it says anything about the antichrist being of Muslim descent. In fact, the word muslim does not even appear in the Bible much less in the context of the antichrist. <br>  <br>  Maybe it is you who should try some reading before you start spreading this rubbish.|`|9dACSXOmaa	wow i never thought of that...although...i do respect what he's trying to do..helping everyone financially and finding schemes that will (supposedly) offer a better standard of living in the future...BUT, he's also thrown security out the window in his trying to please people...and made it so much easier for the islamic terorrists to carry out their plots...<br>  <br>  anyway...i agree...he may be the antichrist.. (though i dont believe in any of that stuff) and if he is, he's not doing it completely on purpose..that's for sure. but his stupid rules and slackenned security are gonna encourage WW3, the idiot!!|`|knOdcrDkaa	People who ask whether Obama is the antichrist are themselves collectively the antichrist.<br>  <br>  edit: lol, Ethan.|`|Gc49JgoQaa	Hopefully.

Only if he were good looking like the guy from The Omen! LOL!|`|AA11458484	No.  In the book of 1st John, it says that the spirit of the antichrist would never be able to say that Jesus is Lord.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	The reason why, is not everyone who uses this all  English answers global forum uses American English. They use universally used British English.<br>  <br>  There are thousands English words we totally spell differently like "centre",  Americans spell it "center". <br>  <br>  It's sometimes annoying to us also when Americans use a word like "check" as a way of describing a form of payment. Which means to look or check for something, not the cheque we would deposit into a bank account or pay for something. <br>  <br>  We never use Z in our spelling of words, Americans spell realize with a Z, we spell realise with an S.  <br>  <br>  So many words which you think are miss spelt aren't, they have been asked or answered by a person in British English.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	It is annoying ...

0rDDPTi5aa	It could be because there are really dark Indian women, like jet black, who would be offended.  Her skin is not that dark.  In the Caribbean, there are a lot of people from East Indian background, and many are called "madras" and they are jet black, even darker than most black people.|`|4a43ce24fc25ee210c17b8882b616386aa	LOL her skin is fair, most Indian women that I see have a darker tan skin then her.<br>  <br>  It's not saying Alicia Keys represents dark skin black women LOL.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	For the same reason black girls get mad when white people say Beyonce is an example of "black beauty". You're saying you can only be beautiful if you aren't "too dark"|`|hQ7oLzH9aa	she is not even that dark, maybe thats why.|`|HxdqZojpaa	i watched about this in the tv once. I think It was because Indians want the light-skinned complexion and it makes them feel beautiful. They say you're beautiful if you have light skin. Since aishwarya rai got lighter out of no where, women get angry at that and get jealous of her "fair" complexion even though they don't know she used skin bleaching cream.|`|IhLebJVZaa	Maybe because Aishwarya Rai is the whitest Indian woman, or at least one of them..Freida Pinto is so much better.|`|UhirBjKmaa	Because she is still pretty light skinned. I would get offended as well.|`|V7rA5yxjaa	Yeah you're right, Aishwarya Rai isn't that light, not when compared to caucasians and east asians. In fact she's quite brown. That said there are lots of Indians in the USA and I've yet to see one lighter than Aishwarya rai, some are even as dark as dark black people. But according to you, she's still dark, so I guess that means there are basically dark and then there are even darker Indians and that's about all.<br>  <br>  Besides Aishwarya Rai is way over rated, in fact she's kind of fugly in her own way as most Indians are.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Because she isn't what I or alot of people consider dark skin. she has medium toned skin|`|2tn8EALqaa	Oh there are more important things to worry about. Seriously, I'm tired of an ethnicity always having skin color issues.<br>  <br>  I actually overheard some Indians the other day talking about how they lightened their skin.<br>  I'm not dark btw, despite my avatar. I'm actually really light...I just don't see the controversy over color...

XuqY2fccaa	I was in fifth grade, at a fall festival, it was late at night, and we went in the woods close to the play ground and she kissed me.<br>  But I got so embarrassed because I must have enjoyed it so much I said "Oh wow, do it again" haha.<br>  She did, but I'll never forget how stupid it was for me to say that.(:|`|UIRdXa6qaa	Well, it was with the first guy I felt emotions for.  His name was Zayne and he invited over to his apartment complex to just hang out. They had a basketball court, and so we wanted to go play. After awhile of playing and running around we were flirting with each other like crazy.  We got to a point where we were just kind of cuddling and hugging.  Then I just went for it after I gave him a hug. It was the biggest rush I felt at the time, and my heart was flooded with so much emotion it was intense. At that time I had never made out with anyone and we just kept kissing and kissing...So he was my first boy kiss, and my first make out ever. It was truly amazing...|`|jLLvmWJHaa	Well, it was a nice day out and me and my best friend were walking to his house. I don't know how, but the weather took a turn for the worse and it was gusting and the rain was really heavy and I couldn't breathe...luckily though his house was only a block or so away, so we got there soaking wet and I was still recovering from my panic attack. He helped me inside and then I smiled and he smiled when we got settled down, and then he kissed me. Of course I obliged and returned the kiss...it was really sweet. :]<br>  <br>  And now he's currently my best friend AND boyfriend!|`|kbCh76Uhaa	7th grade...my best friend Brandon. We used to hug...a lot. And one day he just leaned in and kissed me, while we in Math class. We got sent out of class and made fun of, but it was well worth it :).|`|cSaVqUDdaa	i was in the 2nd grade. and it was with this girl named chantel<br>  and i had a crush on her! so one day i went to her house and she <br>  had this little tint and we went inside. and i wanted to kiss her<br>  sooo bad.. so i made up some bullshit *** lie lol i said<br>  "you know on of my friends told me that whenever i go to<br>  another girls house that im suppose to kiss them" Lmaoo!<br>  i know i got game huh? =P anways she goes "really? i dont know.."<br>  i was like SHOOOT!!!! (in my mind) "well you dont have to if you dont want to i was just saying.." and she was like "well ok i'll try it" im like SCORE! lol<br>  so after we kissed i was like well did you like it? and she was like YEAHHH! lets go it again! lol im soo serious to so then we went down stairs behind her couch and we got all touchy feelie and stuff. haha so yeah<br>  <br>  thats my 1st girl kiss.. 1st time i kissed a dude was in pre-k under a slide.|`|ssV4NDUVaa	Unfortunately, my first kiss wasn't "the kiss" i was hoping it. So it got ruined. But.... the official one was when.... I was in him room, watching a tv with this guy. There's this two best friends in the show, and the other one is leaving. So i said, "Awww". Then my friend says, "Yeah, i'd be sad if my friend is leaving too." Then it got quiet. (Cause i was a month away from leaving, i was moving to a different state) So i said, "Oh, stop. You'll see me again. I just wished i didn't have to leave, but i have to." He said, "Remind me again, why?" I said, "Well... I just can't handle the stress here... Especially about myself" (i was confused on my sexuality. And he's I was a bit falling for him... secretly)<br>  <br>  We were lying in bed with our stomachs , not paying attention to the tv now. He kept asking me what was bothering me and i kept saying 'nothing'. Then he touched my shoulder, and i stopped moving. I looked at his brown hazel eyes, and honestly... I had trouble breathing. I couldn't stand the tension, so changed the subject and looked at his lamp. "Hey, that's a nice la--", but he interrupted me with his his hand touched my face and directed it infront of his face. Then... he kissed me and I kissed him. <br>  <br>  After a slow passionate kiss. We were starring at each other. Then i said... "Oh boy." I panicked and ran towards the door and in to my car. LOL!!! Stupid me, right? Sorry it was long. :)|`|TOtUfscsaa	honestly, i was at a club...and i kissed a girl who was a total stranger. I fool myself into thinking I don't regret it, but I do. The first one that meant something was soft, warm, smooth, and HAWT. We were steaming. :)|`|2iB5erd9aa	im straight sorry
ridu0Rtwaa	I'm completely in favor of the separation of Church and State. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own, so both of them together is certain death.  George Carlin|`|VR9Yjvt8aa	Now if only people had been listening when he said that, or bothered to read it at the time in our history when it would have done the most good to prevent that very strife from finding a berth on our shores.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	I agree. Too bad christians in america are not as smart as James Madison.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Love the quote. As a Christian I don't think government and God should ever mix, it becomes a pain in the ***.|`|TX5uV9bIaa	If you think this means that the nation was NOT founded on the principles of a creator who is the author of our liberties, you would be mistaken.<br>  <br>  The separation was to avoid the convergence of church and political LEADERSHIP...hence no "state sponsored religion".  The Church of England was headed by the King.  Much of Europe was under the Holy Roman Empire...and the wars of the Protestant Reformation were long and bloody.<br>  <br>  Madison was focusing on the NEED for both state and church to exist, but not to become the same.|`|xfmMeJx0aa	A very accurate and sane statement. Good quote. To bad most religious people seem to see it differently. Most of them see freedom of religion as their cue to advance religious agendas into the state and making the separation more about separating state from religion but not religion from state.|`|b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I wonder what the Native American Indians thought of James Madison and the U.S. Government.

uDZZLH0Uaa	no. we as you have said have so many homeless and starving people in america that we should be feeding them before anyone else in any other country. <br>  we are in so much debt because the government gives so much of our money away to 3rd world country's its no wonder america is struggling.<br>  <br>  feed america first all others last.<br>  cheers<br>  mystic|`|sJJcwsJJaa	i say let those clowns starve|`|daZS4jNGaa	i wish someone would let you starve for being selfish!!!|`|Jjh16FoHaa	Let me prefix this, I am not some crazy Christian “God’s love should bless us all” lady. I am an Atheist, who thinks that Spock had it right, “The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or the one…”  I am a middle class American, who happens to live in a developing (3rd world) country. <br>  <br>  So, here is a great logical argument, you aren’t paying attention to the numbers. <br>  <br>  For the price it costs us to feed one American (considering America is a ridiculously expensive country to reside in, and food there is insanely expensive when compared to that in the developing world) we can feed 20 or 30 Ethiopians. <br>  <br>  I have lived in some of the most impoverished parts of the United States, and I have lived in or visited quite a few impoverished developing (you would call it a 3rd world) countries. And I can say, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the amount of suffering abroad is so much greater then in the United States. <br>  <br>  And I also don’t happen to believe that American’s are any different then any other nationality. Why should you care about someone more simply because they were born in the same country as you? That doesn’t seem like a great justification.<br>  <br>  For most people in the developing world, there is no access to opportunity like there in America. You live in a rich world darlin’ don't make this recession scare make you forget that. You have a computer, or access to you... In some places that is riches beyond the wildest imaginations. Possibly the only privilege denied to you is the honor to get to leave that behind, and find out what the realities of being born into a different situation are.|`|GrRXAjF7aa	Finally! Someone of a similar genius to myself.

And I looked at it and saw that with the ear of laziness, it was receiving the same lesson from Satan. Then I understood that those words were as though said in the name of all evil - commanding souls, or else they had been prompted. So I too said: " Since my soul commands to evil, one who does not reform his own soul cannot reform others. In which case, I shall begin with my own soul. " <br>  <br>  I said: O soul! Listen to Five Warnings in response to those words which you uttered in compounded ignorance, on the couch of idleness, in the sleep of heedlessness.<br>  <br>  · FIRST WARNING <br>  <br>  O my wretched soul! Is your life eternal, I wonder? Have you any incontrovertible document showing that you will live to next year, or even to tomorrow? What causes you boredom is that you fancy you shall live for ever. You complain as though you will remain in the world for pleasure eternally. If you had understood that your life is brief, and that it is departing fruitlessly, to spend one hour out of the twenty-four on a fine, agreeable, easy, and merciful act of service which is the means to the true happiness of eternal life, surely does not cause boredom, but excites a real eagerness and agreeable pleasure. <br>  <br>  · SECOND WARNING <br>  <br>  O my stomach-worshipping soul! Every day you eat bread, drink water, do they cause you boredom? They do not, because since the need is repeated, it is not boredom, but pleasure, that they give. In which case, the five daily prayers should not cause you boredom, for they attract the sustenance, water of life, and air of your friends in the house of my body, my heart, spirit, and subtle faculties. Indeed, the sustenance and strength of a heart which is afflicted with infinite griefs and sorrows and captivated by infinite pleasures and hopes may be optained by knocking through supplication on the door of One All-Compassionate and Munificent. And the water of life of a spirit connected with most beings, which swiftly depart from this transitory world crying out a separation, may be imbibed by turning towards the spring of mercy and Eternal Beloved through the five daily prayers. And a conscious inner sense and luminous subtle faculty, which by its nature desires eternal life and was created for eternity and is a mirror of the Pre-Eternal and Post-Eternal One and is infinitely delicate and subtle, is surely most needy for air in the sorrowful, crushing, distressing, transient, dark, and suffocating, conditions of this world and can only breathe through the window of the prayers. <br>  <br>  · THIRD WARNING <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2875&t=The+Twenty%2DFirst+Word" rel="nofollow">http://www.risaleinur.us/read/?art=2875&...</a>|`|gyrihMqhaa	Sallam <br>  And wel come to Islam <br>  <a href="http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/chapter7/5.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.al-islam.org/encyclopedia/cha...</a><br>  <a href="http://al-imam.net/forums/index.php?showtopic=1160" rel="nofollow">http://al-imam.net/forums/index.php?show...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ezsoftech.com/Akram/shiasunniunity.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezsoftech.com/Akram/shiasunni...</a><br>  +For converts <br>  <a href="http://www.revertmuslims.com/sala.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.revertmuslims.com/sala.html</a><br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Parliament/3555/salat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/Par...</a><br>  <a href="http://shiaonline.wordpress.com/power-of-prayers/" rel="nofollow">http://shiaonline.wordpress.com/power-of...</a><br>  ======================================<br>  To Ask Question From a Scholar <br>  <a href="http://www.sistani.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.sistani.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.answering-ansar.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.answering-ansar.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.abubakr.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.abubakr.org</a> <br>  ======================================...<br>  @ Adeeb <br>  Are you Here Again To Call the Ahlybait Kaffir ?<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  @Asker <br>  Shia's are the right Path If You wanna know about shia's Feel free To Email Me ................<br>  <br>  @Hasan ROFL <br>  Which kind of islam is that ?<br>  Ismaeilis are Out Of Islam They are not mulsims|`|zKQKl9mZaa	Make sure you visit reliable sites that give you information about the true essence of Islam though Quran and Sunnah.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.troid.org/new-basics/a-warning-to-the-new-muslim/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.troid.org/new-basics/a-warnin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.islaam.ca/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islaam.ca/</a><br>  <a href="http://abdurrahman.org/salah/" rel="nofollow">http://abdurrahman.org/salah/</a><br>  <a href="http://muttaqun.com/salah.html" rel="nofollow">http://muttaqun.com/salah.html</a>|`|UBjnRty9aa	I love this site<br>  <a href="http://globalislamicsource.weebly.com/" rel="nofollow">http://globalislamicsource.weebly.com/</a><br>  <br>  ALL WHO KNOW AND MAY NOT KNOW OFFICER F...

fc4baf02ff9f98a7a775f05738a7b5c2aa	yeah so everyone already answered what they are.<br>  <br>  But some interesting history:<br>  <br>  Back in ancient greek times, women would often get raped by men. The men would then claim an incubus that disguised themselves as the man must've done it. men held all the power back then so the courts said cool it was an incubus not this man let him go. As for you woman too bad we can't stop the demon.<br>  <br>  men also used this excuse when they were caught cheating on their wives.they'd claim their partner was a succubus lol.<br>  <br>  men were kinda pathetic back int he day.|`|BvY47ts6aa	They are both sexually-hungry demons. Incubus is the male version and Succubus is the female version. By that description you could imagine what victims are favored by each of them. They are fictional and if they are real, I wouldn't want one (in my case it's the succubus) to appear in my dreams.|`|VvMquavyaa	An incubus is male, a succubus is female.<br>  They are both seductive demons that lure their victims into sex/rape.<br>  <br>  No, theyre not real. No, they dont appear in my dreams. No, I have not seen them. They are from mythology.|`|ffAwH6Seaa	I dont know that they are real or not, but i would love to be an incubus. Foul hecubus get thee behind me.lol|`|FmazIF6Maa	Incubus is a male spirit who rapes women in their sleep.<br>  Succubus is a female spirit who rapes men in their sleep.<br>  <br>  I've never encountered any. <br>  <br>  I don't know if they're real, but there are plenty of claims.
z6T7nznLaa	It's a prayer based on scripture.  They often are just prayers taken directly from scripture.  Here are a couple examples:<br>  Matthew 6:9-13<br>  "Our Father in heaven, <br>  hallowed be your name,<br>  your kingdom come,<br>  your will be dome<br>  on earth as it is in heaven.<br>  Give us today our daily bread.<br>  Forgive us our debts,<br>  as we also have forgiven our debtors.<br>  And lead us not into temptation,<br>  but deliver us from the evil one"<br>  All of the psalms are basically prayers as well, so a prayer may be based on those as well:<br>  Psalm 25 is a long psalm with many prayers to God within them.  And some are recognizable as prayers.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	Read the Lords prayer, should answer your question.|`|UinOWcMUaa	Coming from God's word and God's will :)|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Praying Gods written Word.<br>  <br>  Or singing the Psalms to God.  Like, 'We are the sheep of His Pasture...' or 'Thou Oh Lord, are a shield about me, You are the lifter of my head...'. or 'You are the Lord who heals me. You are the Lord my healer...'.  'You have broken down every wall...'. <br>  Psalm103 Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless His Ho.y Name. Bless the Lord , O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.: Who forgives all my iniquities; who heals all my diseases. Who redeems my life form destruction; who crowns me with loving kindnesses and tender mercies; Who satisfies my mouth with good things; so that my your is renewed like the eagles.<br>  <br>  You are the Lord who mends the broken hearted... <br>  <br>  So when you find a Word in the bible that answers your prayer, then you pray it. That is claiming it while trusting God & His faithfulness to His Word. You pray it to God.  God loves you telling Him His Word. He loves it when we remind Him what He has promised us. The Lords promises are always yes & Amen.|`|WiRjbGHmaa	"The Lords Prayer" is a scripture based prayer.<br>  Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,,, etc etc etc.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	God's Will.|`|ylqnNiLaaa	Scripture means a writing about religion significant.

5bubIL4Gaa	i'm in a very similar situation to you. i speak english fluently, but my parents speak mandarin to me at home. i can understand everything they say but its harder for me to think of a response. and then at school i learn japanese which sometimes confuses me a bit cos some of the words are similar to chinese.<br>  <br>  so im fluent in understanding two languages, and semi-fluent in speaking haha.<br>  <br>  but yes, my old french teacher was fluent in english, french, spanish, german and japanese.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	Yes. I come from a Sri Lankan(aka Indian) family and I can understand the language to a certain degree, but I cannot say even a word of it.

Nor is that evolution.<br>  <br>  "Suddenly and randomly things formed and somehow life got on just one planet!"<br>  Not suddenly, or randomly. Gravity, acting on gas clouds for the formation of the stars. The remnants of those clouds form protoplanetary discs, that grow in size, and eventually form the planets. This is no more random than me dropping a pen and it falling down towards the center of the Earth. And again, that's not evolution.<br>  <br>  "Would'nt there be life on other planets to ?"<br>  It's possible. You do realize we've only been on planets within our solar system though, right?

Gravity is a part of God's creation package|`|AA10190722	I used to agree with your implied answer, but I'm starting to think that once people have established their views, it's kind of like a freight train.  So it doesn't really matter what you have your faith in, unless some substantial difficulty comes along, there's no need to think about changing your mind.  "It's already been proven in my mind, whatever it is, so why bother thinking about it?"  That, and changing the entire framework for your life's purpose, your way of conducting yourself and viewing others can be a terribly difficult experience, so people are reluctant to change their core beliefs.  Pride is the biggest hurdle of all.  Who wants to be first to say that all that they ever believed and said is wrong?<br>  <br>  However, even as a Creationist, I have to say that faith in God is probably a more difficult job than faith in whatever I want because he doesn't exist.  (Though the burden is lighter).  Faith in God is something that we have to keep up.  It's a relationship of love and trust.  That's alot harder than accepting an abstract cosmological hypothesis.  But it is the truth that is more important than the ease.|`|AA12008460	The real issue is whether one believes in the epistemology of science or religion; the method of knowing.  You refer to gravity, isn't that just a theory?  There is nothing about gravity in the Bible so it must be that the will of God keeps things in place.  A scientist isn't content with that answer; a scientist wants to learn more about gravity, about the universe, about whether the earth is flat or whether it is the center of the universe.  <br>  The real issue is whether we are willing to accept every answer to every question is, God did it.  A scientist wants to know how God did it, to push the frontiers of knowledge.  <br>  Religious bigots, religious leaders with a huge appetite for power, do not want people to question their singular answer, they want obedience and tithe.  <br>  The old notions of God become obsolete as civilization evolves,  We no longer believe in the bloodthirsty boogie man in the sky.  We question who wrote the Bible and the political contest that Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicaea.  We question the historic and anthropological accuracy of the Biblical accounts.  We question everything.  <br>  Got a problem with that?  Then you should put away worldly things like refrigerators and iPod and go back to riding a donkey.  <br>  I believe in the evidence and when new evidence illuminates the way the world works, I still believe in the evidence.  The world becomes clearer and clearer.  And it is increasingly clear that the old religions are obsolete.  Even the new religious services have evolved and they will continue to do so when the evidence is overwhelmingly contrary to the teachings of religious leaders.<br>  The nice thing is that Jesus' advice is still pretty good when it comes to his recommendations about how we should treat each other.  Too bad Christians really don't give a poop about what Jesus says.|`|jOZWekKjaa	Not really.<br>  First of all, there is no proof that life is only on Earth, now is there? However, if there is life on other planets it's not too likely that we'll encounter them. And maybe on some planets, with the right location, there are creatures that breathe carbon dioxide. And the chance thing.. do you know how vast the universe is. There would be bound to be some life in how vast this whole place is.<br>  Second of all, EVOLUTION DOES NOT DEAL WITH THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE. -.-<br>  <br>  I, personally, don't believe that the universe created itself. However, at least I can understand what people get their ideas from and actually research a topic before I try to critisize it. You have NO idea what you're talking about, yet you try to make fun of an idea.. that you don't understand.<br>  <br>  Yes, you're SO intellegent.. -.-|`|IWlPfk1raa	Who said life has to take shape in human form why can't rocks on another planet with a different atmosphere be possible.

The idea is that it's chance plus natural selection, which is the opposite of randomness.  Think, for instance: what are your chances of twenty heads in a row in a coin toss?  Pretty low if you're for random coin tosses, but what if you have a selection mechanism that throws out tails?  Now your chances of twenty heads in a row are pretty high.<br>  <br>  Not that any of that will sway you; you made up your mind long before you chose to post that.|`|iu2hnHp7aa	No, TL;DR.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok, now that i've skimmed over it, You're a moron.<br>  <br>  First of all, you over simplify the Big Bang, abiogenesis, and evolution grossly, and second of all, the first one provides us with scientific advancements, such as modern medicine. The second one provides us with bigotry and a scientific hole left in the middle ages.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nobody said the matter came out of nowhere, you idiot.|`|6709f9f8b081a814a21bfcf6aade68e3aa	If your understanding of evolution is peppered liberally with "random," then, yeah.

But first, how do you know we are the only planet with life? Maybe the universe is teeming with it. Secondly, mass accumulation of particles due to gravity is observable. The Big Bang was not an explosion, just an influx of energy that caused rapid expansion. Amino acids were formed in the ocean, which is demonstrable. We can see how they could chain together. We can see how nucleic acids could have formed. We can see how extremely primitive 'cells' could have began eating each other, and reproducing.<br>  <br>  About the perfection of the Earth for life. Why must you look at it as if the Earth was honed for life. Let's look at the scope of the universe. There are billions of planets out there. There is bound to be at least one that fits the criteria for life as we know it. This does not indicate design, it indicates the results of throwing a 1 million sided dice 1 billion times.  And again, we do not know that out side of our petty little solar system, there isn't a thousand more planets that are much better at sustaining life than our little Earth could ever hope to be. <br>  <br>  Also, did you know that cyanobacteria actually do breathe carbon dioxide and excrete air.  However, if these were introduced on Mars, the biggest problem would be that they would burst because of a lack of pressure.<br>  <br>  And, of course, evolution has nothing to do with the beginning of the universe, or even life on earth.<br>  <br>  About God, there is no evidence to believe that a God exists. We see no effects that people claim should be there. It is possible that a deity of some kind created us, but there is no reason to believe that anyone on Earth knows anything about this deity. In which case, I have no reason to believe in any stories that any religions may tell.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think science is much more likely to be correct because that is the nature of science. Science does not claim that it knows things, it claims that it is working to understand things, and we will likely always be working, but we will always be getting closer.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, you are right, it is unlikely that matter would come out of nothing. But I don't think matter ever did come out of nothing. Our brains have an incredibly hard time conceiving of the possibility that somethings do not need a beginning, that some things can simply be. First, I would like to give you a simple example. The universe is made up of matter, and in between all that matter, there is nothing. That right there is hard to imagine. But, now try to imagine that the nothing stretches out forever. This is impossible to understand. Our brains are not able to comprehend this, but we know that it is probably very likely true. Why then, should we not think that the matter that makes up our universe has always existed. <br>  <br>  It is much more likely that the matter has always existed than a random intelligent being that transcends time and space decided to create a universe one day, put people on Earth, claim to love them all, but with the intent to have the entire species wiped out. The Earth is not capable for sustaining us for an extended period of time. Why would God have chosen to put us here. No, I'm afraid the God explanation is very unlikely. At least, any God explanation that people claim to know. A deity is possible, but not one that has contacted humanity.|`|nhZWAt8laa	Science works against it's self on this one , evolution say,s that the first cells of life first appeared as a result of the rocks having been rained on for millions of years, combined with lightening strikes .( I call it the electric wet rock theory ).<br>  <br>    So basically the idea is that we,re just rock ape's  LOLOL<br>  <br>    Well then there are all of the experiments that try to simulate such processes ,as a result of every one of them failing to produce anything more impressive that amino acids scientists conducting these experiments have concluded that life only comes from life and life never came from non life.<br>  <br>     But still they stick to the story that life came from wet electric rocks.<br>  <br>    Then there's the theory of the big bang that say's that absolutely everything came from absolutely nothing .<br>  <br>     I think that it definitely takes more faith to believe these self ridiculing theories than to trust the Lord at His word.|`|sBKHnAQ0aa	No. Believing in evolution only takes a few science classes. Believing in God takes Him making a move in our life to show us He exists.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 60:20b ...They are the shoot I have planted, <br>         the work of my hands, for the display of my splendor. <br>  <br>  A lot of the jerks on R&S can't find God because they don't think His words are true. If they knew it was true then they wouldn't be talking all this trash. If you're a Christian (someone who God has forgiven and made righteous thru the work of Jesus Christ) then you are blessed. If you're anything else, then all you are is an example. "What kind of example?" someone might ask... go read the bible and find out.

P5Iq6nufaa	The problem, sweetheart, with these kinds of things, like witchcraft, wicca, or other manners of the occult is that you are in a sense leaving a door open, even in a small way, to Satan. It's not that you have done anything evil or horribly bad, or even committed a mortal sin (it's a venial sin as you have described it as you haven't sought to do harm). I understand curiosity and it's good for you. But Satan looks for our weaknesses, and for us to show in small ways that we are questioning God. This isn't the same as reading Harry Potter books or the Twilight books, by the way. Those books are entertainment and not an act against God or a way to attempt to "go around" Him as long as you don't take the things contained in them and attempt to use them as any sort of substitute for God. By your question, I assume you are Catholic? It might be good for you to know a few passages from the Catechism:<br>  <br>  All forms of divination are to be rejected: recourse to Satan or demons, conjuring up the dead or other practices falsely supposed to "unveil" the future. Consulting horoscopes, astrology, palm reading, interpretation of omens and lots, the phenomena of clairvoyance, and recourse to mediums all conceal a desire for power over time, history, and, in the last analysis, other human beings, as well as a wish to conciliate hidden powers. They contradict the honor, respect, and loving fear that we owe to God alone. (CCC 2116)<br>  <br>  All practices of magic or sorcery, by which one attempts to tame occult powers, so as to place them at one’s service and have a supernatural power over others—even if this were for the sake of restoring their health—are gravely contrary to the virtue of religion. These practices are even more to be condemned when accompanied by the intention of harming someone, or when they have recourse to the intervention of demons. Wearing charms is also reprehensible. Spiritism often implies divination or magical practices; the Church for her part warns the faithful against it. Recourse to so-called traditional cures does not justify either the invocation of evil powers or the exploitation of another’s credulity. (CCC 2117)<br>  <br>  Go to Mass tomorrow and bring this to mind during your act of penitence. You can then receive the Lord knowing that you have made peace with God.|`|cECRv4NMaa	Funny how those who don't know or understand put down beliefs as evil.<br>  1. "Witchcraft" is what the religious higher echelon named anything that threatened their fledgling religious order.<br>  2. Witches were normally herbalists, scientists, any women in high positions free thinkers and midwives. Again, these were all threats to the newly established religion.<br>  3. You can't just "Try" witchcraft, because it needs a lot of education and study. To say you "Tried to do witchcraft" won't work and if it does, it usually backfires. As for pentacles or any other paraphernalia, they are only tools (or just jewelry). They are to help focus, that is all.<br>  4. Witchcraft is neither good nor bad, unless you use it for good or bad, it has rules too.<br>  and finally 5. the only reference in the bible about witchcraft is a mistranslation in which the word Poisoner was replaced by the word Witch.<br>  I believe "God" gave us "Magic" (which christians call "miracles") and depending on how we use these "miracles" will determine whither we are for or against "God."|`|5pgVIlLFaa	The Bible teaches that only God has the right to understand the realm of the supernatural (Gen. 40:8), and that intrusion into the realm of the occult makes one worthy of death (Ex. 22:18)(Also see Leviticus 19:31; 2 Kings 21:6; 23:24; 1 Chron. 10:13-14; Isaiah 8:19; 19:3).<br>  Deut 18:14 <br>  "For those nations, which you shall dispossess, listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so."<br>  <br>  Remember to ask for forgivness. Your father loves you and will wash you white as snow.|`|nNSoOWQDaa	It is definitely wrong, there are many references in the Bible. For example, this was one of the things that destroyed the life of King Saul and led him away from God into a life of sin. It sounds like you are seeking God since you said that you did this to be more with Him. But God despises witchcraft because you are calling on powers of darkness, so instead of being closer to God, you are actually being drawn further away from Him. God wants you to turn to Him in prayer and worship and not turn to other things such as witchcraft. The good news is that no one needs witchcraft or anything else to be more "with" God, because of Jesus we have direct access to God through prayer. Reading the Bible will also draw you closer to God. And if you are truly sorry about what you did and are seeking God, ask His forgiveness and seek to live the way He wants you to. God loves you and will forgive you.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	In ANY form of Christianity it's bad. If you ask for something of God through witchcraft it's just contradictory because it's something he despises. If you wish to be "more" with God, then I suggest you pray.|`|2ogimlBxaa	Wait a minute...Cullen girl?<br>  <br>  Something tells me you're a teenager, who's "witchcraft" probably comes from out of the movies and not from any religion that actually practices it.<br>  <br>  So I guess you're fine.|`|XITPweLEaa	Saying you tried to do witchcraft is like me saying I tried to do christian. What do you mean by "reversing"? What's wrong with pentacles?|`|zlHgIltOaa	Neither are real so guess what, it doesn't matter!|`|MVHxyyUJaa	Depends on how you define witchcraft and magic.  Some of the greatest Catholic philosophers and theologians were magicians in their own right, and many esoteric orders use what we would call "occult practices" in order to get closer to God.  The trick is to go through God, invite Him into your circle and life, and to ask His permission to execute the ritual and to ask for His grace in obtaining your aim.  Anything else, by definition, is heathen.<br>  <br>  If you used "witchcraft" to harm someone, or to attain any state that would normally be a crime or sin, then yes, it's still bad.  If you wanted to help someone in accordance with what is still "good", then no, it's not bad, provided you went through God's power and got His permission to work whatever ritual you did.|`|sxtWUg5saa	When each of us is born we are born under sin,so in a sense we all have betrayed God. But please if you want to be closer to God then I would be happy to help you. It is the way of salvation and the life you live cant compare with what God could offer you. Choosing Christ over all that is the best thing you could do. And yes it bad in Catholicism.|`|bEeozqacaa	Witchcraft is not real.<br>  God is not real.|`|FmazIF6Maa	According to Catholicism, Witchcraft of any kind is a sin. Of course, not everyone is Catholic... <br>  <br>  Witches don't believe they are betraying God because they don't usually agree with the Catholic church about what God thinks/wants. They think the Bible was man-written and it was people who thought God was against Witchcraft that wrote it. <br>  <br>  Witches believe that when they are doing magic, the Creator of the Universe (by whatever title you would like to give it) is fine with it because magic is part of nature and meant for us to use. <br>  <br>  So we use magic but religious Witches still feel we are "with God." We're just not with the Catholic ideas about God. <br>  <br>  It's all a matter of what you believe, how you look at it.|`|wVet0QXVaa	There is a quote in the Bible which says "thou shalt not suffer a witch to live."  Christianity in general is not pro-witch craft and Catholicism confirms this.  The idea is that by opening yourself to the occult, you are calling on super natural powers outside of God.  What sort of powers would those be?  Not the good kind, because all good comes from God.  So Catholics are against witchcraft.  However, we believe God is forgiving, go to confession and explain what happened and you will be forgiven.  We all make mistakes and poor judgements.|`|AA11796124	Practicing witchcraft is a sin. If you want to get closer to God, distance yourself from witchcraft and become more involved in His Church.|`|rn7UAtYJaa	Yes witchcraft is a sin.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes it is wrong.

6ELSwKKvaa	I am not too sure about the short thing. Their measurements are different than ours and I haven't done any studies on that. However, I do know that originally they did live a long time. They were closer to the original gene pool and less genetic diseases had cropped up to cause early deaths. There is also a point at which God set a limit on the human life span if you continue to read further.<br>  <br>    Also, if you are trying to read the Bible like your average everyday book, it is going to be difficult. I suppose it's ok to do it once but the best way to read the Bible is to use a concordance and look up specific topics and read everything there is to read about that particular word. It helps to be able to view it in context to know all the passages.<br>  <br>    Also know that sometimes, especially in Daniel that sometimes the chapters repeat a message but using different symbols as it is a prophetic book. Many of the prophetic books will give various examples of a prophesy using different symbols to help people understand them.<br>  <br>  Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John are all basically the same but written by different authors. One may give more information about a subject than another so it's good to compare notes between them.<br>  <br>    Enjoy. :-)|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) in the bible was everyone really short and lived a long time?<br>  <br>  No.  Lots of people died young, and a few were very tall.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) and they were building entrances to a holy place but it was like 2and a half feet tall.<br>  <br>  I think you have misunderstood a passage in Scripture.  There is no such entrance described.<br>  <br>  God bless your efforts.<br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|fovMmVBYaa	In the beginning humans were much taller, I have been told about 10 feet or so.  <br>  <br>  Not sure where you got your measurements from cubics and feet are not the same, so unless you quote the text and list it I, and other readers, do not know where you got those measurements from.<br>  <br>  When attempting to read the whole Bible, first pray and ask God to send the Holy Spirit to help you understand what you are reading.  <br>  <br>  Personally I like my chronological Bible for daily reading because it has everything in time order, but of course, it is not in book order as the standard Bible is, but it makes for easier reading.  It is set up to allow you read something every day and finish reading the whole Bible  in a year's time.|`|svi31SnYaa	There were both short and tall people in biblical times.  Science hasn't been able to find a reason as to why they were suppossedly shorter than the majority of people today.  Some scientists say that it is because of the way the ozone was like a greenhouse befor the great flood.  But they can't say for certain.  Maybe this information will point you in the right direction.  I'm sorry that I couldn't be more help.|`|ylqnNiLaaa	I think its because nutrition. Nowadays we are taking in a lots of unhealthy food. Hmm..are u a new Christian? I suggest you start reading bible from new testament. Juz an opinion. :)|`|V8TFzhYZaa	They were really short but the average life span was about forty years.<br>  <br>  Bear in mind that until Julius Caesar added the months of July and August (named for himself and Augustus C.), there were only ten months in the year (the last 4 are still named seven, eight, nine and ten in Latin) and that there were only twenty-eight days in each one.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew calendar remains based on Lunar cycles, as does the olde Pagan Goddess calendar.<br>  <br>  Biblical fables of long-lived individuals are apocalyptic in that the symbolism used (eg. "Methuselah lived nine-hundred years") carries secret/sacred messages based upon Hebrew numerology.<br>  <br>  Please see the Sefer Yetzirab and/or the Zohar for more info on the meanings of numbers - and be advised that the Hebrews, like the Romans, had no number for zero.<br>  <br>  Also - and this is very important - if you're reading the whole Bible, make sure that you're reading the whole Bible; which is to say NOT an abridged or censored Bible like the King James version or any of the myriad modern paraphrased versions thereof.<br>  <br>  Probably the most accurate edition on the market today which contains the whole old testament is the "Readers' Edition" of the Jerusalem Bible.<br>  <br>  Make sure it contains Baruch, 1st AND 2nd Maccabees, and Ecclesiasticus (not the same as Ecclesiastes).

Socrates <br>  Greek philosopher in Athens (469 BC - 399 BC)<br>  <br>  There are often reasons that children and teens are perceived to be disrespectful for while it is an age when they start acting out to get their own sense of who they are.  They act out to be different than their parents to try to establish their own identity.  This is a very common thing and it is often something that teens do in all aspects of their life at times that appear rude.<br>  <br>  There are some straight out things that are done rude, that typically, in smaller towns or cities if you walk down the street, and say hello to someone they generally respond back.  If in not so safe neighborhoods more often than not, saying hello to someone would get a response back.  Yet if you say it to a teenager you can get blown off or flipped the bird as a response. <br>  <br>  I think as far as what schools can do to bridge the generation gap, is not too much.  Unless they can hire younger teachers that the students could look up to and almost see as part of their peers and see the reaction that the teacher has.

When adults are afraid of kids, the boundaries are crossed.<br>  <br>  Teens act like they don't have anything to learn from adults, and I really believe that's why their are so many problems with anger, pregnancy, depression, drugs, suicide, drinking, and everything else in between.  They are so full of anger and rage that they think they can solve everything with a fist or a weapon.  And parents are partly to blame.  They fear retaliation from the courts for disciplining their children (no...spanking a child is NOT the same as abuse or beating!) and they let them walk all over them in their formative years, so of course they don't learn appropriate social behavior.  Parents are afraid to set boundaries and stick by their punishment, and they never seem to talk to their children anymore, and expect the teachers to talk about the real issues in life.  <br>  <br>  No, I don't think all teens are bad...I actually get along with most of them that I know, but this is because I actually took the time to sit down and learn how to speak their language.  I used to write teen fanfics for a show I grew up with that returned as a "sequel" type show, and I had hundreds of "fans".  I got to know a lot of kids who were deemed "throwaways", but were just young kids who needed guidance and acceptance.  If adults took the time to learn how to actually speak to teens, they might understand them a bit better...but it has to be a mutual learning experience.  Teens need to understand where adults are coming from too.<br>  <br>  Loudness, eye rolling, throwing tantrums, smarting off, and sneering irritate me to no end!  My daughter is in that stage, and it's been a battle, but she's starting to realize that I won't tolerate her acting the way her friends do.  I realize that part of this is the stress of the world going on around them...it's hard for them to watch their parents worry about money, lose their jobs, etc...they must feel like there's no hope for their future either...but being cruel and mean to their elders and to other teens isn't going to solve the world's problems.  It gets rather depressing to come here and see someone with a broken heart because the girl they liked laughed in their face or called them fat, short, ugly, or whatever...or girls saying a guy had sex with them and then told everyone all sorts of nasty things about them...is this how their adulthoods will play out?<br>  <br>  I wish I could give an answer on how to fix things, but I really don't know.|`|swYKnHkDaa	I think the real question here is, WHY DO ADULTS MAKE SUCH BIASED AND CRUDE GENERALIZATIONS?<br>  most adults take for granted the stereotype of teens being incompetent of thinking for themselves and constantly need to be corrected...<br>  teens aren't disrespectful. they just arent afraid to speak their mind and do what all you stuck up tightwads are afraid to do.<br>  oh and lemme guess...<br>  that was 'disrespectful' to u wasnt it?<br>  well honestly, that's what half the ppl who view this question are thinking...im just the one who said it...|`|zBw8qrASaa	Disrepectful! Words they use: Whatever,yeah ummm,Okayyyyyy sarcastically,i don't care? words......they don't know how to talk and show rspect around elders. They believe they are some thugs and they haven't even been out there yet! All this tough act is  cover to show off to their peers why? To impress! Why? they don't want to feel left out but in the long run they ae doing more damage to themselves then good!

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Do you have a job and buy yourself nice things?<br>  <br>  Just tell her that you're sorry but you can't afford it. Tell her you'll get her something else or if you got some spare cash tell her that you can put 50 or so dollars towards it and she can ask for her parents to pay the rest or she can with her bday money.<br>  <br>  Yes it's rude to ask someone to get you something expensive. I remember I got my friend a precious moments thing with her birth stone. It cost 25$ and she made a huge deal out of it, saying it was too expensive. I figured she didn't know the real price and just smiled and said your welcome. You know what she gave me for my bday? A couple of toy figures and a stuffed animal, they were all hers and used.........we were 14 y/o. Her family had money. I said ty but damn she could have at least given me a card or a shirt instead, she did for her other best friends.<br>  <br>  <br>  My friend Leo didn't have any money, his family was on hard times.

Laugh about it at first and give her a moment to crawl out of her rude ways. If she says she was joking, then leave it at that. If she says that she wasn't joking, then inform her that you will not be able to afford what she asked for. Tell her you had another gift in mind, but that if she doesn't want it, you understand.

She will need to accept this...|`|9Ypxwuxbaa	this is what you do, you get her the present at overstock.com (depending on what it is) and then along with the present include a little card saying.<br>  <br>  "hope you return the favor on my b-day!!)<br>  <br>  but please say what it is so we can help  you better.<br>  <br>  answer mine if you love video games<br>  <br>  (the 2 links are the real question, just take a look and you will see what i mean)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhDyZDX75SuwixDvFYtzv.Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307213056AAwP5UB">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OJIZQYDcaa	Get her something you feel like getting her, and if she decides to pout, tell her you couldn't afford the gift and if she only values your friendship if you can buy her expensive things, she's not much of a friend.|`|8dAvxMeoaa	um have you heard of something called a joke. i am pretty sure she was kidding.|`|UJD2eYebaa	I would just surprise her with a very thoughtful meaningful gift that you know she would like (& you can afford) while completely ignoring her rude request - surely she can't expect something that is way out of your price range.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	I'm sorry, but it sounds like a joke to me.

eCbhygS8aa	There are definately problems within our community but we're making progress. <br>  <br>  You answered your own question. Many of the problems stem from years of brainwashing and oppression. The cycle is a self fulfilling prophecy and when you're treated like scum long enough, you start to believe it's true. There is alot of anger, resentment, and bitterness in our community because of the way we've been treated (and the way we're still treated), and in order to prevent any unity between us, they played some of us against others. With every generation, our race becomes stronger and stronger. It doesn't seem like it now, but when you consider the fact that we're so recently removed from slavery and Jim Crow laws, and only gained our civil rights 45 years ago, we're not doing so bad.<br>  <br>  Never be ashamed of being black.

If I pay taxes and obey laws why can't I get married to the woman I love?|`|w7Ej7KFhaa	I definitely support it. In fact, I don't even believe it should be an issue. You wouldn't condone hiring a man over a woman just because he was a man, so why would you let him marry a woman and not let a just as loving caring woman just because of his genitalia. Besides that, what happened to separation on church and state. The only argument against gay marriage is religious, so why should that be counted as valid in our court system. Also, our founding fathers said that everyone had the right to the pursuit of happiness, if you tell me I can't marry someone based solely on my gender, then you're interfering with my pursuit of happiness, and it's not as if it's going to hurt anyone else. If I was to marry a woman, the only person who would be affected by this decision is me. No one makes laws about which people strait people can marry. It's absolutely ridiculous that people think that they have the right to vote on other people's love lives. No one can tell me who I can and can't love, and isn't that what marriage is all about?|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Support.........we deserve to have the same rights as everyone else.

xm98nbdpaa	You are definitely wise being concerned about the differences in your faiths.  You state that you both are strong in your own faiths.  May I ask what you base your faith on?  Have you personally studied the scriptures?  Has he?   Are you living on your own faith or your parents?  Most kids live on someone else's faith until their own is tested.  Has your faith ever been tested?  <br>  <br>     I believe that our spiritual life is the most important one.  Anything or anyone that interferes with that should be avoided.  As you are aware there are hundreds of denominations even here in the USA.  There are about as many teachings too.  Some of these teachings are in direct opposition to the others so it is clear that they all can't be right.  So how do we know which one to follow.<br>  <br>  Some would say ask your pastor or preacher.  Well it depends on which church that person is a part of as to what answer you will get so I conclude that would not be beneficial. <br>   <br>  The apostle Paul said we should study to show ourselves approved unto God.  Let me encourage both of you to study the scriptures with an open mind and then compare the teachings of your church with what the Bible says.<br>    <br>  I know that the Apostolic church uses fear to keep their members.  They really work on the emotions of people and tell them when something bad happens that it is because they are going against the church.  While it is true that sometimes God does punish us for our wrong actions it is not always the case when something goes wrong.  Read the book of Job and you will find that you can go through a lot and still be right with God.<br>  <br>  I also know that the Apostolic church makes speaking in tongues a requirement to be saved.  Don't think I ever read Paul saying this.  In fact he calls the gift of tongues the least of the gifts.   I don't know whether or not you and your boy friend will ever get married but perhaps God is giving you this opportunity to freely study on your own what the scriptures teach.  I encourage you to at least study with your friend and see what they teach.  I also would encourage your friend to study with you as well with the same open mind and pray that God will lead you both in His way.  <br>  <br>  If the Apostolic is going by the Bible, they should have no problem with people studying to make sure they are.  They are not your judge and can neither condemn or save you.  It is wrong to try to frighten you into submission.  <br>  <br>  I would like to talk with you more and perhaps let you study with some in the group I moderate.  Some have been through what you might experience.<br>  <br>  If you are interested add me to your friends and contact me by email.<br>  <br>  My prayer for the both of you is that God will help you find His truths and follow your findings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saved2seek (also lightofjoy)|`|zdKBa8EIaa	well if you really love someone religion shouldn't matter, but if it's that important to you both than whats there to worry about if you are both strong devoted christans than let that be your only concern. sects should not come between christianity. ya'll both believe in jesus and his father than there is nouthing else religous wise that you need to be worryied about....... see this is why non-denominational is the way to go. lol|`|r9nxFkGtaa	Denominations are a creation of man, not God.  As long as you are both followers of Jesus Christ, nothing else matters.|`|535f79b3a3a04acf01ddfd6276ad9e6baa	I would say be careful. God brought me out of the church of Christ. I am now a Holy Ghost filled Christian and in the Apostolic faith. If you truly love this guy. Pray that God opens his eyes to the truth contained in the word of God. God can use you to win him. Do you know the church of christ says miracles have ceased. But yet me and my Grandson Aaron are living Testimonies that they haven't. God healed me from kidney failure and Aaron from heart disease. I am no longer on dialysis and off the transplant list. With my DR saying he has never seen anything like this and that not only are my kidneys better but there is NO sign that they have ever had trouble. God does still preform miracles.<br>  I know of many that have been brought out of the church of Christ and can give you their stories of how God brought them out and filled them with his Spirit and not only that but changed their lives.<br>  If you are Apostolic please be careful. Most of all pray and study so that you are not easily swayed<br>  I am not sure if I am allowed to post links on here so I will message you a link to a group me and a few friends run. Its actually a new group due to MSN closing theirs and we ran into another group that was an offshoot of another group I was a part of. We have merged onto a forum setting and now have over 140 members. 30+ I know have come out of the coC and will be glad to help you<br>  <br>  Grace from Alabama|`|6rkdAmneaa	OK, I see you are getting answers from both the church of Christ and Apostolic side and from various other christian sides.<br>  Here's a side you might not have expected to hear from. I am atheist, and don't worry I am not one that spews out hate to christians on here. This is actually my 1st post on this answers thing. While you may be wondering why is an atheist answering.<br>  I grew up in the christian faith and have experienced both the Apostolic and coC side. I grew up Apostolic (ALJC to be particular). At the age of 29 I converted to the coC. My conversion was mainly because I was obsessed with study and found many things the Apostolic faith could not answer. Well that helped for a while but then I was still studying and finding more and more that the coC couldn't answer. My obsession to study and finding exact clear cut answers has driven me to not believing in any form of God<br>  Decide whats important. If religion is important, then make it job 1 in your life. It will be extremely hard on you if you choose a man oner your beleif<br>  <br>  Gregg<br>  <br>  Just my 2cent|`|Gzi5CoEPaa	I see he wants you to go visit with him, Have you asked him to visit with you.<br>  I was told all my life that this Apostolic Pentecostal faith is nothing bur a tool of satan. That there was nothing to these "experinces" other than the hype they generate. And I believed it. I was actually told as a kid by my mom that mos of "those" people seemed to be a off their rocker.<br>  I am now one of "those" people, and so is mom. I would not trade this for anything. That joy you felt when God filled you with His spirit, you wont find it in a coC. They dont believe its even here today. My mom is Grace, the lady that answered above me. She told me about your question on here so I had to come and post<br>  I was talking to a cousin of mine the other day who herself is comming out of the coC and was baptized in Jesus name. We were discussing, the church of Christ cant explain how my son was healed of heart disease and brought off life support. They use 1 cor 13 to say miracles have ceased but if you look more closly that refers to the return of Christ, That hasnt happened yet. But yet they fail to to explain to me that if God stopped preforming miracles. Why is my son alive today when by all means he shouldn't have<br>  <br>  But really be very careful about getting mixed up with them. Me and mom have a VERY dear friend who has got mixed up in the coC and has struggled since. Infact she had started some excelent groups that while they may no longet be here have been excelent in helping others see the error of the coC. I do believe God will completely bring her out  but she herself told me a couple years ago before I lost contact with her that her getting involved in the coC was one of her biggest regrets that she was having to fight to overcome. Getting involved in that group may cause struggles in your life. While you need to make your own decision. Get in the Bible and study, If you dont it will be easy to be swayed|`|JHuJhGTbaa	Hey Sandra.<br>  I was asked by Grace to come share my story on here. I grew up in a non church going home. I graduated HS at 18 with dreams of becoming a vet. I enrolled in state college and in the spring of my first year I tried drugs for the first time. I went one more year but by the spring of my sophomore year I was failing and lost all financial aid so I dropped out. In the next 2 months my drug habit led me into strip dancing  and prostitution. I was in and out of rehab for 3 years. Then in 2005, during my stay in the rehab center here I ran into a wonderful young lady named Janice. She was a worker at the center and also a member of the church of Christ. She started talking to me about God, even brought me a brand new Bible and case. When I was released from the center, She came and picked me up for services and even the weekday studies they had. I was soon baptized and stayed very involved. I got out of prostitution and the dancing. But I had a battle with drugs that was not near that easy. I tried so many times to quit but all I did was fail.<br>  When they would have lessons on obedience and how if we loved God we would be obiedant to him and his word. I would go home in tears. What was wrong with me. I know drug use is wrong andd sin, but why can't I quit. I love God. I want to be faithful. I was on the brink of suicide several times due to the fact I thought I was a failure. I mean I was even to the point I would not leave the house. I stayed home and read and studied, thinking there was some thing that I was missing but then I would be right back out getting more drugs. <br>  Last July that changed. I was at my local wal mart and went to the restroom where I found a tract that taught about the saving and delivering and healing power of God. One one hand I was scared to death because of what I had been taught about pentecostal churches since being in the church of Christ. But I was desperate. I wanted freedom from this that had a hold of me. I wanted to be able to see myself as more than a failure because I could not overcome this.<br>  I went the following Sunday to this church. By the end of that morning service, I was in tears. What was it in this service? It was more than emotionalism. There was somthing there. Somthing powerful. I stayed after service and spent the afternoon talking to the preacher and his wife. That night I was in service again. I was rebaptized before the evening service, in Jesus name. What happened that night was nothing other than amazing. God filled me with the holy Ghost and not only did I speak in tongues but even more amazing, He delivered me right then and there of my drug addiction. I have been clean for 8 months now and am so very happy'<br>  <br>  The church of christ does have some truth to them but they are missing out on so much<br>  <br>  Tabby|`|NNvcd5Bhaa	Well if you are talking about the same church that was once the International Church of Christ, the same one that has been banned from many college campuses because they prey on young people. Then I say stay away from that church. I was a part of them once and they do not teach the truth. If thats not the same church, then disregard what I said.<br>  <br>  I honestly do not see where Apostolic teaching differs from any good bible teaching church. As far as I can tell it is pretty straight forward. I always have a red flag go up when anyone tells me that I will go to hell if I dont believe like they do, especially if we are both christian. The bible was intended for the common man to read it and understand it all by himself, and still go to heaven even if he didnt quite get it all. <br>  <br>  I would tell your pastor that he really needs to read up on the part where we were all told to "GO and make disciple of all nations" because that means we need to get out of our own church and mix it up with the world, being led by the Holy Spirit to bring the Truth of Jesus everyone. Even other possibly misled christians. Dont get too deep in a relationship until you are clear that he believes the truth. And if he believes that his church is the only true, and saved church in the world, then you will have to make him see the truth.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	yeah that's probably not going to work, you don't want to insist he leave his faith and you obviously are not going to leave yours so unless you are okay with going to church seperately even when you're married (if that ever happens) then I would leave now.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I am Roman Catholic.<br>  <br>  I think marriage is a challenge under the best of circumstances,  and that it is very unwise to marry someone with significantly different religious beliefs.  It impairs the ability of the husband and wife to be fully intimate.  Physical relations alone are only part of the intimacy of marriage.  A rich prayer life is very important,  and to enter marriage knowing this will be limited seems to me to be unwise.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	You do not go to hell for leaving a church!.

Zk6vJMS4aa	My astrology book says: <br>  <br>  "Fixed - One of the three qualities under which the signs of the zodiac are classified. The three qualities are cardinal, fixed, and mutable. Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius are the fixed signs and comprise the fixed quadruplicity. In astrology, the fixed quality signifies persistence, single-mindedness, determination, and resourcefulness."<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|CaILVXbyaa	These are "over generalizations"...but maybe this will give you some<br>  thing to "get a handle on" the topic:<br>  <br>  Cardinal Sign people can tend to try to take the position of leader <br>  (more often than not) and may tend to start stuff (like business start<br>  -up).  They can tend to "forge a new path" as well.  <br>  <br>  Fixed Sign people tend to like Sability.  They will maintain a business<br>  once started by a Cardinal (who then sold it because they're bored<br>  with the "humdrum" of no novel problems to solve).  Most Fixed <br>  people don't like surprises (unless it's a birthday party).  Fixed Sign<br>  people tend to prefer "known problems" (with "known solutions").<br>  <br>  Common Sign people tend to be followers, and will examine (with<br>  varying degrees of close-ness) both sides of debates to guage the<br>  accuracy.  Common Sign people tend to apply this proclivity towards<br>  Contrast and Comparison to almost everything they do.  They make<br>  no "snap" decisions.|`|uuQrhnJ4aa	Fixed-means exactly that. You're fixed in one position. You're the type to be a supervisor to tell others to get things done while you observe the proceedings. <br>  <br>  Stability is also an accurate term to use. However, fixed & cardinal signs are very vibrant personalities. (I have both in my family of origin. I'm a mutable & act as the communicator btw the two!)<br>  <br>  There are many levels to astrology, as you've discovered beyond just the sign & elementals. Plenty of websites offer further explanations into fixed, mutable, cardinal. A very quick, detailed but easy one is: www.bobmarkastrologer.com<br>  <br>  Used bookstores and Barnes & Noble have excellent books to explore this topic further. They go into great depth & you can see what you're getting as opposed to an online store. There are also specific stars associated w/each, moons, planets, gemstones, plants etc. The book is basically an encyclopedia. I can't recall the name of it, mine is packed up in storage right now or I'd give you the title.  If you find that type of book it will greatly enhance your journey & learning experience!|`|BvY47ts6aa	People belonging to the fixed signs are dominant in their characteristics. The way I understand it, Fixed signs cannot be paired with another Fixed sign. There are 4 Fixed signs in the Zodiac, one for each elemental group, just the same thing with Cardinal and Mutable signs.<br>  <br>  My research says:<br>  Fixed Signs are at the height of the four seasons. Fixed Signs are associated with stamina, perseverance and strength and said to be, by nature, inert. However, they are also associated with inflexiblity. Individuals born under the four Fixed Signs of the Zodiac are thought to be determined, powerful, natural leaders, purposeful, reliable, loyal and self-confident but also occasionally stubborn and immovable, with a tendency to get stuck in ruts. They supposedly pursue their goals with dogged persistence and have a great power of concentration. According to astrologers, Fixed Signs tend to direct their energies inward rather than outward.

KWvGUoW6aa	I agree. They should start teaching future ministers about dangerous things such as science and reason, and evolution, so that Christians will be better equipped to deal with these deluded god-haters who want to take away our precious Savior, Jesus, by using their brains to come to logical conclusions about reality.

AA10671142	I agree with you. if a teacher does not know sign language that well, how can they teach deaf students. they are suppose to be able to Communicate with the students and if they are not able to the student will never learn. teachers today are getting worse everyday. I am so glad my children are out of school. even the students in special ed who do hear, the teachers don't teach them at all and just pass them to the next level. your grammar is fine, I understand everything that you wrote. I get tired of reading about deaf people that can not read when I know someone that is always reading and he is deaf or that deaf people are dumb. that is not true at all. they are as smart as any hearing person|`|PnlgLBcwaa	a big part of the problem--at least in my area is the lack of qualified teachers as whole--no matter what area-<br>  <br>  in one district near me they purposely hired people for jobs tehy were not qualified for---even when they were positions the teacher was qualified for--for example--hiring a dyslexia specialist to teach emotionally disturbed...<br>  <br>  a school will hire a non fluent teacher of teh deadf over no teacher of teh deaf..<br>  <br>  it is possible for a non 'native speaker' to become fluent--just as soem people have gotten fluent in foriegn languages....|`|4fffa6bae2775acc0a4469d4a0d63b20aa	There is a shortage of qualified teachers in many areas, for many things.  Someone I know, who previously worked as an aide in a Special Education class and has no formal training or desire to be a teacher, was assigned to teach several classes simply due to the fact that there were so few teachers available in that area.  She has wanted a job as a simple receptionist this whole time, but since the district had made budget cuts and no teachers wanted the job, they moved her from being an aide (the only job they had for her when she applied initially) to being a teacher.<br>  <br>  She needs a job, cares about kids, does a great job with her own kids, was wonderful as an aide and obviously they believe she is qualified enough to be a teacher.  But she is completely overwhelmed and this is really not what she wants to do.  Things are just crazy right now.<br>  <br>  Schools are making budget cuts - perhaps that is happening in the case you are referring to.  Maybe there just aren't enough deaf teachers available, or the school cannot afford them.|`|5319529690edf313d843743d4cacfc1baa	I agree that teacher teaching deaf / hearing impaired should have high stand of sign language some as blind student having a teacher who know braille.

Then then do on learning sign.<br>  <br>  I heard of one school in brisbane that has 3 deaf children per a class and all children at the school learn some signing but most for all I know don't.<br>  <br>  I also met someone who was deaf but raised as hearing.  Until she couldn't understand what her dad was saying at 16.  So then she learn sign language.<br>  <br>  I don't intend to be a sign teacher|`|AA12140689	In some areas there is shortage of qualified teachers, so it may not be easy to find a teacher who is very good at sign language.<br>  <br>  Also, if the people who take care of hiring teachers cannot speak sign language themselves, it can be hard for them to be the judge of how good the teacher is at sign language. It's possible that the teacher has finished some education regarding sign language, but is still not very good at using it.<br>  <br>  I agree though that teachers should be very good at sign language in order to get to teach deaf children. It's a shame that that's not always the case.

uuQrhnJ4aa	What you're talking about is filming sexual activity. Normal spousal relations are accepted, but when one films the process there can be consequences. <br>  <br>  If you download it to a computer for viewing, it can get hacked. If the computer is lost, stolen, sold...then you're both out there for everyone to see (images aren't erased when deleted, their format is scrambled & is easily recovered). <br>  <br>  If it's on a DVD or a memory card, they can get mixed in with other media and seen by inappropriate eyes (kids or strangers). Ppl have mistakenly left media in cams & dvd players only to have it discovered by repair personnel, borrower of the equipment, or the next owner. <br>  <br>  In cases of anger, jealously, etc. it can be uploaded to porn sites. <br>  <br>  That's all assuming everything remains good. If you separate/divorce, one can use the film against the other. When kids are involved, things like that are terrible in court custody cases.<br>  <br>  Back to the original issue: viewing titillating material can increase a person's appetite to see more and actually propel either of you to consult porn. It can cause you to lust after your spouse in an unhealthy manner. It can become an addiction. It's not a good idea.

Such as lightning and thunder (Zeus and Titans). Because religion has been known to find a supernatural explanation to all questions, the greatest question of all would be "Who then, created our god?" The simplest answer to this would be that God is beyond and above all things, and thus doesn't need a creator... I've got to agree, it sounds like a quick answer to an impossible question.<br>  <br>  And why did the force behind the big bang have to have conscience? That doesn't make sense to me.

Was Paul crucified for you? Were you baptized into the name of Paul? 14I am thankful that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius, 15so no one can say that you were baptized into my name. 16(Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else.) 17For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel—not with words of human wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.<br>  <br>  Brothers, I could not address you as spiritual but as worldly—mere infants in Christ. 2I gave you milk, not solid food, for you were not yet ready for it. Indeed, you are still not ready. 3You are still worldly. For since there is jealousy and quarreling among you, are you not worldly? Are you not acting like mere men? 4For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not mere men? <br>   5What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only servants, through whom you came to believe—as the Lord has assigned to each his task. 6I planted the seed, Apollos watered it, but God made it grow. 7So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God, who makes things grow<br>  <br>  I Corinthians 1:10-19; 3:1-7|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Anyone who believes that Jesus is God, believes in the Bible and follows Jesus teachings, is a Christian.

The human condition is marked by sin, and because that is so, we are unable to understand the Bible perfectly. We do the best we can and come up with differing answers.<br>  <br>  There are countless other explanations, though, not to conteract this one (because it is the technically right one), but to show that different denominations aren't always a bad thing ... <br>  <br>  The Bible doesn't explain fully how Christians in the New Testament handled baptizing their children. Some insist that all must be baptized as adults, other show that there is sufficient implcation that whole families were baptized together (presumably including infants). In this case, it make sense to allow two denominations, one that holds one idea and one that holds the other. So having many denomiations actually promotes peace among Christians.<br>  <br>  Some denominations believe that women shouldn't be pastors, while others believe those scriptures were addressing only a specific problem in a specific region at a specific time. No one can say for sure, so better to have different denominations, rather than to have one fighting all the time.<br>  <br>  There are certain things that Scripture will not let us debate on -- these are the clear teachings about God being the creator, holy and just; man being a sinner in need of salvation; Christ dying on the cross to take our place and satisfy or debt of sin; our needing to receive Christ to be called "children of God."<br>  <br>  These are non-negotiable things.

For instance, Lutherans are based on Martin Luther. Pentecostal churches were formed from a revival in the early 1900's. Calvary Chapel movement (still non-denominational) is based on both a leader and a movement in the 1960's.<br>  <br>  2) Churches split for non-essential issues: This can happen for any number of reasons, and this usually happens based on non-essential beliefs.  The Assemblies of God and the Foursquare churches split on the basis of having women pastors / preachers.  The reasons for splits are numerous, but Christians are called to dwell at peace with other Christians. When sin arises and strife happens, splits will happen.<br>  <br>  3) Location: Many denominations happen because of geographic locations. For instance, Southern Baptists started in the Southern US, but now have churches nationwide.<br>  <br>  4) Breaking off based on essential issues: Other church splits happen based on men finding corruption and lies within a church, and/or splitting from it based on bad teaching essential for salvation.  Martin Luther split off of the Catholic Church because of bad teaching.|`|nhZWAt8laa	alot of it Has to do with the differences in how one reads the bible.<br>  <br>      I for one trust Gods word to be mostly literal, but of coarse some of it was written in a metaforical way in order to avoid persecution from the hostile authorities of the times in wich they were written.<br>  <br>     Well the metaphorical parts are one exaple of why the church has divisions it's been difficult through the generations of these past 2 thousand years for people to always reach the same conclusions from the same text.<br>  <br>      Also some people view the whole Bible as a metophorical representation.<br>  <br>     Moses parting the red sea for example , some people just can't except that the God who spoke the whole universe into existance could do a little thing like part a relatively small peice of water.<br>  <br>    I on the other hand Have no problem with it, or any thing that God's word say's.<br>  <br>  <br>     Another example is some who say that they trust Gods word then say that they beleive in worldly teachings like evolution. <br>  <br>    While others just trust Him to be all that He says that He is .<br>  <br>   I think that the greatest cause of these divisions is that people rooted in the teachings of mans school systems, philosophies and sientific THEORIES just can't alway's read God's word without trying to take God himself out of the equation and replacing Him with some earthly, humanistic guess at what might have happened .  <br>  <br>     This to me is quit sad since often there will be several , even hundreds or thousands of witnesses to the events in question who are noted in the text, but people of today try to explain  away the miraculous events like these witnesses were not there. <br>  <br>   anyway these are just some of the examples of why theres division in the church ...I hope that I've been helpfull to you and that God will richly bless your life|`|GrRXAjF7aa	If you have ever sat down, and actually tried to read the bible, you would understand very quickly! :)<br>  There are so many riddles, and so many different ways to interpret the bible, that its no wonder there are 39000 different denominations.

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  Our Lady has 117 titles. She selected this title at Fatima: "I am the Lady of the Rosary."<br>  <br>  St. Francis de Sales said the greatest method of praying IS- Pray the Rosary.<br>  <br>  St. Thomas Aquinas preached 40 straight days in Rome, Italy on just the Hail Mary.<br>  <br>  St. John Vianney, patron of priests, was seldom seen without a rosary in his hand.<br>  <br>  "The rosary is the scourge of the devil" -- Pope Adrian VI<br>  <br>  "The rosary is a treasure of graces" -- Pope Paul V<br>  <br>  Padre Pio, the stigmatic priest, said: "The Rosary is THE WEAPON"<br>  <br>  Pope Leo XIII wrote 9 encyclicals on the rosary.<br>  <br>  Pope John XXIII spoke 38 times about Our Lady and the Rosary.

Why does that scare me? Mainly because religious people all think that there is life after death, and that it is superior to life on this Earth. For this reason, there are a huge number of people who are HOPING for the end of the world. There are a large number of others who are working their asses off to try and bring about the end of the world. <br>  <br>  That should be enough! But let's look further; in Northern Ireland, just for example, sects of Christians were at war with each other because they were the wrong kind of Christian. Christians in nigeria recently raided a muslim village. Muslims behead infidels. <br>  <br>  And then there is the Government. I am not form the USA, but I will use it as an example. I saw a video clip of a woman saying "I do not know what George Bush's campaign is all about, but I will vote for him because he is Christian."

Most atheists that you talk to will admit that there may be a small chance that a God does exist but his/her existence is not likely. <br>  <br>  This is how we are different. We will take the 'proofs of existence' and test them. If they fail, it is no longer respected.

And we like to piss people like you off.<br>  <br>  No, but seriously now. Most atheists base their beliefs in science. In science, everything needs to be proved in order to be held as fact. You think atheists needing to find evidence to back their claim is a sign of insecurity and self-doubt. This is incorrect. People who don't have an educated background and who don't have facts and evidence to back their beliefs are labeled inexperienced and ignorant. If you're not willing to do the work to support your theories, then why should anyone listen to you?<br>  <br>  Atheists try to disprove god because he is not tangible. He is such a huge influence on the entire world that merely disagreements about religion cause wars to come about. Why should we wage war on something/someone that we don't even know exists? Why should we have to die for something we don't believe in?<br>  <br>  The reason we try so hard to disprove god is because our lives are affected by religion when we don't want it to. If we were to not have any facts or evidence to back ourselves up, then people like you would force us to convert to your religion.<br>  <br>  Also, you claim to have no doubt in your mind, that you don't need to "waste [your] time trying to prove this." If that's so, then why did you ask this question in the first place? Why did you challenge us, saying you're willing to debate on this? You've just contradicted yourself. The point of debating is to persuade the other party into believing what you are telling them. Judging from what you've written, having a debate with you would be pointless and inane. All you'd probably do is reject everything I tell you and respond with "God is going to punish you for your sins. You're going to hell for not believing in him." You're not asking a serious question. You're looking for people to beat down.|`|eDYXQxA9aa	I spend no time attempting to disprove god. <br>  <br>  I will quite happily pass a few lazy minutes picking apart many of the intensely silly arguments put forward for gods existence here however. Thats kind of fun.<br>  <br>  On the rest of your nonsense - can you identify a fact that might disprove the existence of your god? I can't offhand. However, I'm really under no particular obligation to - you see, I make no assertion. You claim there's a god, you prove it. If you don't want to prove it, don't talk about it. I don't need to prove that your idea is wrong - you need to prove it is right, or just keep it to yourself.|`|vvQWHVWOaa	This is because, at bottom, atheism is psychological.  It is not intellectual, it is emotional.  Most atheists have a need, an almost fanatical urgency to feel and be seen as very intelligent.  It is like this false sense of superiority is their security blanket, and when confronted with arguments they have a hard time answering, they become ferocious.  They do not take kindly to their tower of blocks being knocked all over the floor when they've been bested in an argument.  This isn't because they're sore losers, but it's because psychologically, their soother (false sense of intellectual superiority) has been taken from their mouths, and rather then admit defeat like a true intellectual would do, like a baby does, they throw a tantrum.<br>  <br>    Atheism is also psychological regarding authority.  Nobody tells an atheist what to do--he/she is an island and they and they alone govern that island.  Spoiled teenagers also despise authority.  This is one reason why the new atheism and its preachers target teens the way it has been because they share that same "nobody tells me what to do attitude". Pseudo-intellectualism is also appealing to a teen because most of them lack self-esteem or self-worth. Teenagers are easy targets for atheism for those reasons, and also of course because atheism tells them they can live fast, die young, and leave a good-looking corpse without care or concern for moral responsibility.  They are easily corruptible.<br>  <br>    But the deepest and most profound psychological reality of the atheist is his/her dependency on religion. They cannot keept themselves from religious persons or religious discussion.  The topic of God, someone they fervently claim doesn't exist, becomes the center of their universe.  That mystified Ghandi about atheists.  Look at these question boards: about 85 -90% of the questions and rants are put forth by atheists.  Often they like to say God and the tooth fairy are essentially the same concept--except they don't spend time talking about the tooth fairy as they do talking about the Christian God. To spend so much time being consumed by that which you profess to abhor is the epitome of backwards. The compulsion they have in immersing themselves deep in religion and pursuing its adherents is irrational.  It has nothing to do with upholding seperation of church and state, or responding to religious intolerance or oppression because the western cultures they inhabit, heavily favour their worldview.  The church of Darwinism in public schools, supported by taxpayer money, would be just one of many.  They can't and won't avoid talking about God, Jesus Christ, Christianity, or the bible.  It is their drug of choice.  It is their opiate.  Could the reason for this be that deep in the chambers of their soul, they know he exists?

umGi6gTcaa	no I like registries. You don't have to buy what they ask for, buy them what you want as long as there isn't something similar on their list or you can wait until the last day and buy the similar item as long as it hasn't been checked off the list yet.<br>  <br>  Recently I attend a baby shower where the cheapest item on the registry was 50 bucks. There weren't a lot of items and the woman told me she gave ppl limited options so she would get what she wanted. I bought her some cloths, which weren't on the registry. If she was ungrateful enough to say something to me I would have taken them back and returned them (keeping the cash for myself, she had her chance with the cloths). She liked them though, saw her baby wear one of the clothing sets more then once.|`|49c07573b2ef8b7f4c512a10de7d7febaa	On the contrary, I like knowing where a person/couple is registered.  I want to get them something they WANT, not something that I THINK they want.  I don't consider myself obligated to buy anything just because I know where they are registered.  <br>  <br>  To me, gift registries make a huge amount of sense.  They also mean that I can (usually) simply go online, buy what I decide to buy for them, have it shipped, and never have to mess with all the hassles that usually accompany gift-giving.  Much better all around, in my book.<br>  <br>  If you got an invitation and you don't want to give something, then don't.  It's entirely up to you.  If the party is a shower, then gift-giving is its understood, socially-sanctioned purpose, to help a couple with a new stage in their lives (marriage, baby, new home, etc.)  If you can't afford a gift (or just don't want to give one), then it's not polite to go to the party to start with, because that's why it's being held.   If it's the celebration itself (birthday, wedding, whatever), then its purpose is a social ritual, and while a gift is nice, it's not required.  Two different affairs; two different situations; two different responses.|`|0kWsC3Uhaa	It's not an obligation, the registry is just a helping hand for people who don't know what to buy - and then that way you don't get 7 toasters.

AA11026013	I hope this helps: Just what is sexual harassment? The book Coping With Sexual Harassment and Gender Bias, by Dr.?Victoria Shaw, defines it as “bothering someone in a sexual way .?.?. It can be physical (such as touching someone in a sexual way), verbal (such as making unwelcome comments about someone’s appearance), or nonverbal.” Sometimes the harassment involves crude propositions.<br>  <br>  The Bible condemns “obscene jesting.” (Ephesians 5:3,?4) Therefore, you have a right to feel angry, upset, confused, and even demeaned when you are harassed!<br>  <br>  How, then, should you react if someone bothers you in this way? Sometimes a weak or vague response only makes a harasser try harder. The Bible tells us that when Joseph was propositioned by his employer’s wife, he did not simply ignore her. Instead, he firmly rejected her immoral advances. (Genesis 39:8, 9, 12) Today, being firm and direct is still the best way to fend off harassment.<br>  <br>  Simply saying something like, ‘I don’t like that kind of talk’ or, may get your point across. However you word it, do not water down your message. Let your no mean no! If [He] does not catch on to your kind hints, you have to tell [him] straight out. It often comes to that.  A firm ‘CUT IT OUT!’ may do the job.<br>  If the situation escalates, do not try to handle things alone. Try talking it over with your parents or other MATURE adults. They may have some practical suggestions for dealing with the situation. As a last resort, they may even feel it necessary to alert school officials. As uncomfortable as doing so might make you, it could protect you from further victimization.|`|25358204164d6e396a9823e7bd566d46aa	Umm, No all he did was yell boobs he didn't touch your boobs.|`|451995de6fb72b834e0802c8ad7ac052aa	well since the guy wasn't actually making gestures toward YOU it may not be strong enough to win a sexual harassment accusation, HOWEVER you could turn him in for just plain harassment.|`|76a7b4ddfc1af29392c1c59264fadc99aa	sorta. not really. some guys are weird like that|`|83d856a115a07511fc47c0068c35ccf9aa	Sounds like the guy likes you and some guys when they like some girls, they loose the ability to speak coherently. Maybe he wants to say something else to you, but that is the only thing that flies out of his mouth.<br>  I say, hunt him down, no not with a gun, find the guy and have this conversation with him, let him start to talk to you using all the vowels and consonants he can muster, you might find he is a nice person, anyway if you confront him until you KNOW the conversation is over, he will either be a new friend for you, or will run the other way when he sees you.<br>  Great luck|`|96b3f4ceb250646b406ba44e21313424aa	sexy herassment?|`|AA12167742	Whom did you report it to the last times? If nothing was done, was he still aware that a report was made? Because this happened am assuming in high school it will be hard to prove sexual harrassment because most adults laugh off the behaviour of teenage boys as immature rather than illegal. My opinion is that yes it would be if this were in any other situation and you were not a student. As annoying as he is, karma will take care of him. Report him if only if you are sure action will be taken. He may continue to do this because he likes the 'attention' you give him.|`|944e834948591e9af24fa28ac5ecb873aa	I'm not really sure if it would be harrassment. maybe? Yea if it bothers u and he keeps doing it I would tell someone. Make him feel like an a** when he says stuff like that I would clap really  loud and say---OH!! yea! big boy learned a new word 2day!! aren't u soooo smart? or if he yells boobs! I would yell; tiny penis!!|`|eb5653ccad53cf1ac1d61346e4b6f9c8aa	I don't think it was, but this boy should not be disrupting during school hours.

If he keeps doing it though you probably should report him for harassment|`|9da9eef011319719130fcda07d588a2caa	"Boob" or "Boobs" also means a stupid person.

WmD2DfxCaa	My advice is to wait for the return of the Master.  I know who he is. My avatar is in honor of the first part of his first name. Sanskrit root meaning eternal Law. He is the founder of Asharishi yoga named after his name Asharishi Yogi.  Rishi meaning a Seer or one with awareness.  His message is travelling around the world.  I use one of his one liners from time to time, “Seeing is the deepest aspect in being”.  It is said he has made years of meditation obsolete. Please connect with me.|`|QuaVnaOEaa	Using  intense meditation, which means trying not to concentrate on anything or think of anything,  the goal of meditation is trying to  become oblivious of all thoughts and things, to escape forever the material world of of pain and thinking, to get off the wheel of karma........and when achieved, Buddhahood and Nirvana are attained...so who cares what is next ?    From a Buddhist.....peace|`|mU2eMSi3aa	Imagination is important if you want to explore the ethereal worlds.  Once you have learned to attain the state that you have you can go into your meditations with the intent to explore the realms of other planes, to talk with other masters, to view past lives, visit sacred temples and read the writings of the ancients.  Imagination marks your intent and is an active tool that helps you move from passive nothingness towards other goals.  Good luck and God bless.

And it was translated in the middle ages by people who were trying to build up the Catholic church. Greek words (like English words) tend to have more than one meaning.

4MdQoPG9aa	Ho trovato una bella descrizione al riguardo,<br>  e ne riporto il testo:<br>  <br>  <br>  Il Sanscrito è la più antica lingua al mondo. Ma rispetto ad altre lingue antiche, come il greco o il latino), il sanscrito è l’unica lingua antica al mondo che ha mantenuto la sua struttura e il suo vocabolario originale sino ai giorni nostri.<br>  <br>        La più antica letteratura del mondo, i Veda, i Purana e gli Itiasa sono oggi disponibili nella stessa, identica forma in cui sono stati scritti.<br>  <br>  Il Sanscrito è tutt’oggi una linga parlata. E non mi riferisco solo ai Bramini e agli eruditi indiani. Esistono trasmissioni televisive e radiofoniche inSanscrito. Ed il suo uso quotidiano è in costante crescita.<br>  <br>   La grammatica del Sanscrito è particolarmente precisa e definita. Uno studio comparato delle diverse lingue ha portato la NASA a definire il Sanscrito come la migliore lingua in assoluto per l’uso con il computer.<br>     <br>   Il vocabolario del Sanscrito deriva da sillabe-radici. Questo lo rende estremamente adatto per aggiornarlo con parole e termini scientifici che descrivono le attuali nostre conoscenze. E queste nuove parole risultano comprensibili a chiunque comprenda ilSanscrito.<br>  <br>   Nei versi della imponente letteratura Vedica sono nascosti principi scientifici, conoscenze astrologiche, astronomiche e matematiche difficilmente visibili in una traduzione. La lettura dei testi inSanscrito permette invece di scoprire facilmente tutta questa ricchezza.<br>  <br>  <br>  Il Sanscrito è l’unico linguaggio conosciuto che ha in sè stesso la sua grammatica, lo schema di pronuncia e le regole per la formazione di nuove parole.<br>  <br>  <br>  La ricchezza di sfumature del Sanscrito è incredibile. Ha la capacità di tradurre veramente qualsiasi concetto in parole.<br>   <br>  E’ la lingua del cuore. Qualsiasi sia il vostro stato d’animo o la vostra emozione, il Sanscrito vi offre le opportune parole per farla comprendere agli altri.<br>   <br>  Il Sanscrito è contemporaneo ai Veda. E i Veda non possono essere studiati senza i 6 Vedangas.<br>        I primi tre trattano della lingua parlata. Per la precisione il primo tratta della pronuncia delle lettere e degli aksharas.<br>        Il secondo tratta di come comporre le parole.<br>        Il terzo classifica i suoni radice. In questa classificazione rientrano i sinonimi (ad esempio vengono indicati circa 120 sinonimi per la parole acqua, ognuno ovviamente con una leggerissima differnza dagli altri).<br>        Il quarto si occupa della metrica (vi sono circa due dozzine di metriche vediche e un’infinità di altre metriche).<br>        Gli ultimi due si occupano dello spazio e del tempo.<br>   <br>  <br>  Il Sanscrito ha 51 lettere o aksharas. Nelle altre lingue ci riferiamo alle lettere come alfabeto. Al contrario, nel Sanscrito, le lettere e gli aksharas hanno un significato fondamentale. Il suono delle singole lettere ed il loro significato viene mantenuto nella parola da esse formata. La pronuncia della parole è essenzialmente la pronuncia dei singoli aksharas contenuti nella parola stessa. Ciò lo rende adattissimo al ‘text-to-speech‘ computerizzato.<br>        Il secondo aspetto di ‘non distruzione‘ consiste nel fatto che gli aksharas mantengono nella parola che formano il loro significato. Per fare un esempio consideriamo la parola ‘guru‘. E’ formata dai due akshara ‘gu‘ e ‘ru‘ e indica un maestro che dissipa l’oscurità (ignoranza). L’akshara ‘gu‘ significa oscurità, mentre l’akshara ‘ru‘ significa l’atto di rimuovere.<br>  <br>  La conoscenza del Sanscrito dà la gioia di poter leggre nella loro lingua originale le grandi epiche indiane. Ad esempio il Ramayana con i suoi 24.000 versi o il Mahabharata che con i suoi 100.000 versi è il romanzo epico più lungo (e più grande) al mondo.<br>  <br>  .... .... .... .... <br>  <br>  inoltre è interessante ricordare che il numero delle lettere dell'alfabeto sanscrito (51) è esattamente lo stesso del numero della somma dei subplessi dei nostri chakras ( 51)<br>  e rappresentano , secondo la tradizione orientale, i suoni emessi dal passaggio dell'energia vitale ,nella fase di risveglio,nel nostro sistema nervoso centrale.<br>  <br>  .|`|3IQDAATXaa	è una lingua indoeuropea...|`|EBFus0Iraa	Il Sanscrito (??????? in devanagari) appartiene alla famiglia delle lingue indoeuropee, è una lingua ufficiale dell'India, dalla quale derivano molte moderne lingue del paese (primo tra tutti l'hindi, la più diffusa); il termine sams-kr-ta significa, nell'antica lingua, "perfezionato" e può essere reso col latino con-fec-tus (si noti che la radice kr del sanscrito corrisponde alla radice fac, es. facio, del latino). Il ruolo di questa lingua nella cultura indiana è simile a quello del Latino e del Greco antico in Europa. In sanscrito furono composti molti testi classici, come ad esempio i Veda.

E'  una lingua che si e' evoluta attraverso moltissimi secoli  e quindi esistono vari tipi di sanscrito. Tutte le lingue del ceppo Indo-ariano (come fra l' altro il greco e  il latino ) derivano dal sanscrito che potremmo definire il progenitore di tutte le lingue (molti studiosi ritengono che anche l' ebraico derivi da questa nostra lingua antenata).

e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	Great Question!<br>  <br>  The Bible says do not "murder" not do not "kill".<br>  <br>  The best translation of the command in Exodus 20:13 is “Do not murder.” The Hebrew word for “murder” here is ra?a?.  Strong’s Definition:<br>  <br>  “AV translates as “slayer” 16 times, “murderer” 14 times, “kill” five times, “murder” three times, “slain” three times, “manslayer” twice, “killing” once, “slayer + 310” once, “slayeth” once, and “death” once. 1 to murder, slay, kill. 1A (Qal) to murder, slay. 1A1 premeditated. 1A2 accidental. 1A3 as avenger. 1A4 slayer (intentional) (participle). 1B (Niphal) to be slain. 1C (Piel). 1C1 to murder, assassinate. 1C2 murderer, assassin (participle)(subst). 1D (Pual) to be killed.”<br>  <br>  This term has to do with unjustified killing. However, there is a word “kill” that is used for justified killing. Such as a just punishment for a crime or killing animals for food. The word for “kill” in such circumstances is ?a?a?. Strong’s definition:<br>  <br>  “AV translates as “kill” 42 times, “slay” 36 times, “offer” once, “shot out” once, and “slaughter” once. 1 to kill, slaughter, beat. 1A (Qal). 1A1 to slaughter. 1A1A beast for food. 1A1B sacrifice. 1A1C person in human sacrifice. 1A1D beaten, hammered (of shekels). 1B (Niphal) to be slaughtered, be slain (of food or sacrifice). 2 (BDB) slaughtering. 2A word doubtful.”<br>  <br>  There is of course other words that can mean “kill” could be used but the usage of “rasah” is a deliberate attempt to convey what we call “murder.”|`|o9Ckf0h4aa	No/No.A correct translation of the commandment is "Thou Shalt Not Murder".Plus, there are examples in the Bible where God himself.Sent armies into battle,Telling them to kill every person, animal, and burn down every dwelling.When they were disobedient, he punished them.|`|LF4vun1maa	The commandment was actually not to murder.  Which doesn't include killing in war, killing your disobedient children, etc.<br>  <br>  The god of the old testament was actually a big fan of killing in general, just not murder in the knife a guy down for his wallet sense.

adfb163a1daffd885f4cf3b65b9fbc00aa	L'origine della parola "tedesco" <br>  <br>  Guardando bene, la parola tedesco assomiglia un po' alla parola deutsch e non è un caso: infatti, le due parole hanno la stessa radice. Nel medioevo, nel territorio della Germania, che non esisteva ancora come stato, si parlava il latino (lingua della chiesa e dei saggi) e una lingua popolare chiamata theodisce. Questa parola appare per la prima volta in un documenti dell'anno 786 dopo Cristo, proviene dai dialetti germanici e significava semplicemente "del popolo". Quindi, in origine "lingua tedesca" significava semplicemente "lingua del popolo" a differenza dal latino che era la lingua dei saggi, dei monaci, la lingua di chi sapeva leggere e scrivere. Da theodiscus si sviluppa la parola deutsch, e in Italia la parola tedesco. I tedeschi ovvero die Deutschen erano quindi semplicemente coloro che parlavano la lingua del popolo.<br>  <br>  Che cos'era "la Germania"?<br>  <br>  La parola italiana Germania era usata già dai Romani che chiamavano così il territorio tra i fiumi Reno, Danubio e il mare baltico. I popoli che vivevano lì erano i Germani. Lo storico latino Tacito scrisse, nell'anno 98 dopo Cristo, il famoso trattato Germania - De origine, situ, moribus ac populis Germanorum dove vengono studiate da un punto di vista geografico ed etnografico le popolazioni germaniche.|`|f1e73d2a6e92058532461e9812f62a30aa	Bella domanda, ma non so risponderti.|`|b744274a7dbdb65c01edab6f6137cadaaa	YA!|`|34b13af4a8598ccfdea3afb866e67a14aa	Lo sai che moltissimi anni fá si diceva anche "Germani o Germanesi" oltre che tedeschi?

Al final, cada quien elige con quien compartir la vida, con quien casarse o si prefiere no hacerlo, ?qué mas da a los demás?, en otras palabras: si alguien elige ser célibe, libre y conscientemente ?qué cuestionan los demas?

En el siglo 1200 era tan grande la corrupción de los miembros de la Iglesia que Gregorio VII impuso entre las tantas premisas que el hombre que se dedicara a predicar el Evangelio, en principio hacer voto de pobreza y consagrar todo su tiempo a Dios,  y de ahí surge el celibato. En la figura de San Francisco de Asís hombre de familia rica y poderosa, deja de lado todo los bienes  terrenales para consagraste a Dios, haciendo voto de pobreza,  teniendo innumerables seguidores que fueron considerados locos y duramente combatidos, por el mismo clero, ya que eran hombres ricos y poderosos.Es obvio que va contra natura, creo que en poco tiempo  lo vamos a ver,y se va abolir el celibato. En este tiempo hay una minoría que cada día aumenta que curas que se han casado y siguen al frente de una iglesia dando misa. Para esto deberá irse el actual Papa, que por su edad es muy conservador, por eso se elige después de un papado de veintitantos a?os al cardenal mas anciano, considerándose un proceso de transición.

Blasfemo por que?<br>  Acaso no debe haber diversidad en cuanto a ideologías? Además si Dios nos hizo a su imagen y semejanza y el hombre es un ser imperfecto no debemos suponer acaso que Dios es también imperfecto?<br>  <br>  Manten la mente abierta y acepta las ideas de los demás, sino estas de acuerdo al menos respetalas.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Para que se sulfuran todos Jesús hera humano como todos nosotros y tenia sentimiento y también sentía amor por todos, por que no lo giba a sentir de una mujer si es la mas natural del mundo.

Sin embargo se aferran a la idea de que nació de una virgen, que resusitaba muertos, que convertía el agua en vino, que endemoniaba cerdos. Pienso que si Jesús existió debió ser como cualquier mortal y no como narra la biblia.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|dpRAQXW0aa	Pues me parece bastante lógico. No puedo imaginar a un hombre, judío, inmerso en una sociedad machista, con el mandamiento de Avrom de poblar la tierra, viviendo en comunidad con más judíos, que no se haya casado y engendrado hijos. Es más, me parece IMPOSIBLE.<br>  <br>  Si existió, era un hombre, no una entidad incorpórea. No dudo en lo absoluto de éste hecho, dado que a los judíos, un hombre o mujer estéril o que no puede tener hijos les parece abominable, aún en éstos tecnificados tiempos que vivimos.<br>  <br>  <br>  Setanta, el Perro de Culann.|`|wKCIXCTCaa	?Por qué el casamiento de Jesús sería una mancha? ?Acaso, cuando nos casamos, incorporamos un nuevo pecado a nuestra ya larga lista? ?O una persona, para ser perfecta, tiene que ser célibe?<br>  ?O crees que la Vida de Jesús, sus 33 a?os en la tierra, se limita sólo a lo que cuentan los Evangelios "oficiales"? Si quieres, puedo enviarte los que la Iglesia Católica llama "Apócrifos", es decir, los de Santiago, Tomás, Judas... donde cuentan otras cosas de la vida de Jesús, que no interesaban en la época de Carlomagno, y que hoy pondrían en tela de juicio si la Iglesia está haciendo bien las cosas...<br>  Jesús es Dios, pero también fué hombre...|`|0e345e1e2813a48c752dc95219657fb0aa	Jesús para mi es guía y apoyo. Sinceramente le profeso un enorme respeto, admiración y amor, sin embargo, <br>  <br>  era hombre de carne hueso, sentía lo mismo que nosotros, tenía las mismas necesidades, dolores, miedos y tentaciones, <br>  <br>  y si sus pescaditos eran sanos, es muy probable que haya tenido hijos<br>  <br>  y si fue así, que bien, por que entonces nos da el mensaje de que es bueno tener hijos.|`|10d9eccca95e5eb44c136fbb94b2feceaa	No es para nada blasfemo, él era un hombre de carne y huesos, así que pudo haberse casado, y para darte un dato más preciso: "con María Magdalena"...|`|4bd01cd814ab982a78a635166c61e9beaa	Y si enamorarse, casarce y tener hijos te parece blasfemo, y mas aun si te estas refiriendo a una persona o ser con el corazon y el alma pura de el, que seria de nosotros.<br>  <br>  Calmate y bajale la espuma a tu chocolate.......<br>  <br>  Pudo haber sido, pudo no haber sido....<br>  <br>  Y si fue asi que tanto.............., ni tendrias que fastidiarte por eso y tacharlo de blasfemo........|`|F1Nayfkeaa	para nada, puesto que era humano y el hacia lo que queria y no andes con tu mente chaquetera.|`|c40viMyZaa	?Manchando?A ver...?la vida acaso es una blasfemia? ?el amor es algo digno de reprobarse? ?es sucio?<br>  <br>  Y no estoy diciendo que es verdad o mentira, si no que si se tratara de una gran posibilidad ?qué con eso? .Creo que tienes un mal concepto de lo que es moralmente correcto, tu visión es muy estrecha, y con ello no pretento convencerte, si no expresar lo que pienso. Además Jesús no fue ningún Dios, él mismo dijo que la "vida nueva" era buscar a Dios dentro de cada uno, no en templos, no bajo la guía de un sacerdote. Jesús fue un hombre, y como tal, vivió todos los sentimientos, ?por qué el amor carnal habría de ser prohibido? ?acaso tu Dios no fue el supuesto creador del "sexo"? ?estás diciendo entonces que se "equivocó", creando algo "pecaminoso"?.|`|f4ad18ac29dd3cc7b21285ef18a3e81faa	Si tienes toda la razón blasfemos e irreverentes. Jesús murió en esa cruz por ser limpio y sin pecado, pero sabes yo sigo confiando en El y creyendo en su gran gloria y santidad y no me logran confundir.|`|o4I2AnzKaa	son ignorantes tienen q leer mucho para saber|`|yjM4ppJ9aa	Y porque blasfemo ?<br>  <br>  Que Jesús no era una persona ?<br>  <br>  A ver, por primera ves en tu vida piensa y usa tu imaginación:<br>  <br>  Imagínate la época en la cual vivió Jesús, ok ?<br>  Imagínate las costumbres de esa época... sale ?<br>  <br>  Bueno, ahora piensa, si prácticamente todos los judios se casaban jóvenes, antes de los 20 a?os, imagínate que hubiera pasado con Jesús si pasaban y pasaban los a?os y no se casaba...<br>  Lo mas seguro es que lo hubieran acabado apedreando y lo hubieran tachado como que no era una persona grata para los dioses... Probablemente lo hubieran corrido o matado en ese tiempo...<br>  <br>  Ahora si, aunque no te guste, también Jesús fue un ser humano y tuvo que vivir como ser humano, no ?

yoslJ9Yxaa	Un flat tire significa que tienes el llanto pinchando. Tambien se abrevia como un flat sólo. En slang flat tire también puede usar para decir que algien te pisa el zapato de atras hasta el punto de que lo tienes mal puesto (es dificil explicarlo). <br>  <br>  Fewer lanes quiere decir que en el camino se estrecha a menos carriles (por ejemplo de 3 carriles a 2).  Road narrows quiere decir casi lo mismo pero no necesariamente que cambie a menos carriles sino que el camino se hace más estrecho.   Lo contrario a fewer lanes sería more lanes y lo contrario a road narrows sería road widens (se amplia).<br>  <br>  Siempre se usa para indicar a los traficantes que va a ser un cambio en una carreterra o camino. A menudo no se pone las expresiones en EEUU sino se utilizan se?ales con rayos (indicando carriles) que se unen o se dispersan|`|eaaa78afc20593c0187c449951b94c3baa	Tratando de contestar tu pregunta<br>  Flat tires = Llantas ponchadas(sin aire)<br>  Fewer lanes = Menos carriles<br>  En la siguiente no estoy de acuerdo como la escribes,  en mi opinión no se escribe ROAD NARROWS, mas bien alreves NARROW ROADS y significaría caminos angostos<br>  Lo contrario de fewer lanes seria more lanes<br>  Lo contrario de narrow roads seria wide roads<br>  Yo no presumo de saber ingles pero se que en ingles se dice primero el adjetivo, en este caso narrow (angostos) y después el sustantivo, en este caso roads (caminos)<br>  Eso esta en plural, en singular quedaría Narrow road<br>  NO ME CREAS A MI,PERO TE RECOMIENDO QUE INVESTIGUES, PARA QUE LO QUE TENGAS QUE HACER LO HAGAS CORRECTO Y LO MEJOR POSIBLE<br>  Y no presumo que mi LENGUA MATERNA ES INGLES<br>  Mi lengua materna no es ingles pero vivo en Estados Unidos y por eso me atrevo a contestar.|`|13ff102ff3ec66c3af37068b45fc72a5aa	flat tires son ruedas planas o sea esas que son lisas, no tiene los huekitos y las demas expreciones ni ieda|`|6eee9f2525684a394d1fb2d0562b6bfaaa	flat tires son llantas ponchadas segun yo, <br>  fewer lanes son menos carriles <br>  road narrows supongo que es cando baja de dos carriles a uno o algo asi que se estrecha el camino <br>  y pues no se me ocurren mas expresiones|`|68bcfe9ff52243c6512c4105274b0ab5aa	Yo tampoco presumo de saber mucho inglés pero viví en Florida U.S.A. y saque la licencia de conducir en mi primer intento y aquí te van algunas definiciones:<br>  <br>  Flat tires = llantas desinfladas y/o ponchadas<br>  Puncture tire = llanta ponchada en inglés culto<br>  fewer lanes = disminuyen los carriles por donde circulan los autos<br>  road narrows = el camino se hace más angosto o sea en vez de dos carriles de ida se puede volver solo uno o bien el carril en el que vas en vez de ser más ancho se hace más estrecho<br>  merging lanes = es cuando tratas de meterte a una autopista viniendo de un camino secundario y por supuesto en la autopista no hay semáforos que te den el paso, por lo tanto te tienes que meter a la  autopista a la misma velocidad que los otros carros entrando por el carril de baja velocidad (que en Estados Unidos es el carril de la derecha) dicho carril de baja velocidad es tanto para entrar a la autopista como también para salir de ella, cuando tratas de entrar una se?al te advierte la velocidad mínima a la que debes entrar para no causar un accidente por entrar muy despacio; y al salir de la autopista una se?al te advierte también la velocidad a la que debes disminuir para no llegar a los caminos urbanos a una velocidad muy alta.<br>  Espero y te haya servido esta explicación cualquier duda ahí me mandas un mail a mi correo y te la contesto. ?Que estés bien!|`|78H6RveBaa	flat tires son llantas ponchadas o desinfladas, fewer lanes son pocos carriles y road narrows son caminos angostos, lo opuesto serìa a lot of lanes or many lanes y wide roads caminos amplios.|`|o5w0o1Bvaa	Goma o neumatico en llanta, menos carriles, se estrecha el camino.

You don't have to wear a sign stating that you're poor so people will get to know you & like you because of who you are, not where you live or what you have. Life is always going to be that way.

I am much younger than you, and I am poor too. My mom is from a small village and she is also poor , she went in the city to work as a maid and to study college. Unfortunately, she didn't continued her studies (just 1 year) because of financial problem. My dad is also from a small village, he is also poor but very diplomatic and smart. He went to a university but finished only 2 years because of financial problem also. His family wanted him to be a priest but he didn't last long as a trainee so he went to cooking. There he met my mom (she's a pastry chef) but she never wanted to marry a poor man because she knows it will only bring her down to her dream of becoming rich. But that didn't work, they were married even though my father's family doesn't want my mother because she is also poor. My dad became a successful chef locally and abroad because of his skills but his salary isn't that enough to call us "rich". I am currently on a public high school.. they think I'm rich. Not acting "rich" but showing what I can be. I won several contests and had been the valedictorian of our elementary, and the top student of our class. So that made them think "She isn't poor. If she's poor, then how can she achieve all of this?".. well, I must say that My family is poor but rich in opportunities.<br>  <br>  We own a farm.. my older brother is in south part of America (somewhere)  working as a head bartender and my older sister is studying in Germany (she won a scholarship)<br>  I am 13 by the way.. so I work hard because I know things will be worse and better.|`|swYKnHkDaa	Hey, dude,<br>  Don't worry about it! :)<br>  no need to hide nething <br>  and no need to display it either<br>  look, just be urself. and make friends<br>  u might just meet some nice new friends :)<br>  be optimistic,<br>  haha no worries,<br>  sometimes i feel like i'm in ur same situation <br>  make the best of the situation u have and set goals for urself<br>  graduate high school, get into college, make a life for urself and ull never have to face this again<br>  good luck and dont sweat it<br>  :))|`|umGi6gTcaa	Go to a thrift store in another town if you can. By grandma worked at one in a nice/rich neighborhood and she always got my brother nice (polo,Hilfiger, etc) cloths, some even had tags on them. If you can scrape together some cash try to shop at an outlet, I know they have name brand outlets like Klein somewhere in Pennsylvania.<br>  <br>  Just try to keep your cloths clean and if someone says something say "it's my style. Just because everyone here dresses preppy doesn't mean I have to conform." If they know where you live they wouldn't expect you to dress as nice as them but screw it. I know right now it's painful but this is high school, it's just a short time in your life.<br>  <br>  Growing up I was lower-mid class. I wore nice but nameless cloths while the other kids in my school who's families were on food stamps had name brand. Cracks me up that some of them complained they were hungry yet they had no trouble getting 100 dollar sneakers. My first name brand was a pair of mudd jeans when I was 13.<br>  <br>  Now I'm married and very comfortable thanks to my husband. He tries to spoil me (successful most of the time) but my past helps keep our check book in check lol.
fOfJz9OMaa	We need to understand what it means to believe according to Christ, which He tells us in (John 14:12), that they who believe will do the works that He does.  This is to say, that if we are truly sincere, we will make a sincere effort to deny our own will, and submit to His in all the things which He tells us.   Believing is indeed a mind-set, but with a mind-set is a performance; if we truly believe we will also do what He in whom we believe tells us to do; its that simple.   As for the ceremony of baptism, Christ Himself insisted that He be baptized, and saying that it needs to be so, to fulfill all righteousness.  And so we who say that we believe in Him, shall also follow His example; but for us baptism is our acknowledgment of our intent to wash away our sins and reform our lives.   As for is it enough to believe, yes of course; but again, if we truly do believe Him, we will do what He tells us.|`|2e06c84d21db358502c752a7100c3c3eaa	Believing in your heart is what you need but you also need to confess with your mouth - Jesus is the Lord of your life.

What is my friend talking about?<br>  <br>  A: He is talking about having a conversion experience in which one prays to God or Jesus and asks to be forgiven of one's sins on the basis of Christ's death on the cross. The phrase "ask Jesus into your heart" is not found in the Bible, but originates in a later, Protestant evangelism campaign. It is not definitive of what a Christian is either according to the Bible or according to Church history. A person is a Christian if he is baptized and professes the Christian faith.<br>  <br>  All Christians should take their faith seriously and devoutly cultivate his relationship with God and with Jesus, but that is not presented to us in either the Bible or the history of the Church as one of the requirements for being Christian. The New Testament regularly refers to people as Christians even though their walk with the Lord may be very shaky. Once they have been baptized, the New Testament does not deny them the title "Christian." Only by a total repudiation of the Christian faith can one lose this title.<br>  <br>  Your friend is confusing a particular evangelistic campaign with the essence of Christianity. Periodically, to get people to take their faith seriously, evangelists have come up with questions to get people to think about their level of faith in and committment to God.<br>  <br>  Examples of these questions are "Have you ever received Jesus into your heart?", "If God asked you why he should let you into heaven, what would you say?", "Have you made a personal committment to the Lord Jesus?", "Have you accepted Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior?", and so forth.<br>  <br>  Questions like this are well and good--people need to be given a jolt every so often to consider whether they are living in harmony with God (St. Paul, for example, gives his Corinthian readers such a jolt when he tells them: "Examine yourselves, to see whether you are holding to your faith. Test yourselves. Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? -- unless indeed you fail to meet the test!"; 2 Corinthians 13:5).<br>  <br>  However, sometimes such evangelistic questions get repeated so often that people forget they aren't in the Bible and that Scripture does not present salvation in those terms (that is the point of coming up with the question in the first place--to phrase the idea of salvation and committment to God in a new way, a mode of expression not used in the Bible, so that people will be jolted into thinking about it).<br>  <br>  When this happens, people end up confusing their own particular evangelistic campaign and way of phrasing things with the essence of Christianity. They then go around asking people their evangelistic question as if it the test for whether someone is a Christian, and anyone who does not give their group's formula answer is then told they are not a Christian and need to question their salvation. It sounds like this is what your friend is doing.<br>  <br>  If you were baptized (irrespective of your age at the time) then you were by that very fact given a personal relationship with God and put into the sphere of his grace. If you are not in state of grace now it will be because you have committed a mortal sin, not because you haven't followed the particular formula of a particular evangelistic campaign.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	Most Christian denominations use Baptism as an entry ceremony... but keep in mind, no one knows what John the Baptist or the disciples of Jesus were doing when they baptized people.<br>  <br>  And also keep in mind that the Christianity we see these days is not much like the original spiritual movement that Christ started.

Ella comienza a ser Madre de Dios cuando el Hijo Eterno se encarnó en sus entra?as. Dios, para hacerse hombre quiso tener madre.

AA11986514	La cita correcta:<br>  <br>  "Parece absurdo de todo punto - lo confieso espontáneamente- suponer que el ojo, con todas sus inimitables disposiciones para acomodar el foco a diferentes distancias, para admitir cantidad variable de luz y para la corrección de las aberraciones esférica y cromática, pudo haberse formado por selección natural. Cuando se dijo por primera vez que el Sol estaba quieto y la Tierra giraba a su alrededor, el sentido común de la humanidad declaró falsa esta doctrina; pero el antiguo adagio de vox populi, vox Dei, como sabe todo filósofo, no puede admitirse en la ciencia. La razón me dice que sí se puede demostrar que existen muchas gradaciones, desde un ojo sencillo e imperfecto a un ojo completo y perfecto, siendo cada grado útil al animal que lo posea, como ocurre ciertamente; si además el ojo alguna vez varía y las variaciones son hereditarias, como ocurre también ciertamente, y si estas variaciones son útiles a un animal en condiciones variables de la vida, entonces la dificultad de creer que un ojo perfecto y complejo pudo formarse por selección natural, aún cuando insuperable para nuestra imaginación, no tendría que considerarse como destructora de nuestra teoría."<br>  <br>      * El Origen de las Especies, Espasa-Calpe, 1988, pág. 230<br>  <br>  Aunque Charles darwin despues de todo era solo humano, y comete errores al igual que todo ser humano... por muy listo y muy preparado que sea... es un error logico creer en una sola verdad... por eso los ateos tenemos infinidades de fuentes de informacion... no solamente Darwin... pero ustedes peque?as mentecillas medievales solo tienen la biblia.<br>  <br>  Y no son perfectos querida TOSCANA... tu organismo es un monton de piezas mal colocadas e imperfectas...

Otros puntos débiles eran el " eslabón perdido " entre humanos y simios asi como el antepasado terrestre de los mamiferos marinos como ballenas y delfines .<br>  Se ha avanzado en todos ellos , y en cuanto a la evolución del ojo , este ha sucedido me parece que en mas de tres ocasiones obviamente en vertebrados , pero tambien en cefalopoos ( clamares , pulpos , jibias ) y CREO en algunos insectos avanzados como la mantis . Al ser una herramienta tanto para la caza como para la defensa , es obvio que ligeros adelantos en ella ofrecían muchas ventajas a los individuos de una especie .<br>  Aun rudimentarios sensores de luz , permitenn a bacterias y microorganismos buscar lugares cálidos que les dan mayores posibilidades de supervivencia .<br>  Y a pesar de haber expuesto su tesis , Darwin nunca se declaro como alguien que no creyese en Dios , por el contrario me PARECE que era una persona muy religiosa .|`|33315295bf0d2502d7154fc233f96a23aa	?no sabias que la iglesia siempre mete su cuahcara en donde le conviene?<br>  <br>  ?no recuerdas ue pasó con galileo?<br>  <br>  ?como primero lo condenó, y despues pasó a ser "estudiosa" de su teoría?<br>  <br>  jajajaja<br>  <br>  eso ni significa nada, si la iglesia no metiera su cuchara, te lo creería....<br>  <br>  <br>  saludso...|`|KYFAKENsaa	no, cualquiera puede decir que la teoria de la evolucion es una barrabasada sin que lo quemen|`|U9z1HC7Faa	hola, la verdad no creo en lo que dice darwin pero tampoco soy religiosa.|`|xY5J3wpxaa	bueno, habria que investigar que estuvo bebiendo darwin ese dia, nadie es perfecto,,saludos|`|AfFKMM9jaa	Darwin hablaba para una sociedad que no estaba preparada para aceptar la teoría de la evolución, por lo tanto, se anticipaba a las críticas que vendrían, ya que conocía muy bien el ambiente científico de su época.<br>  <br>  No soy evolucionista.

rU6nh42Eaa	You might surprise them sometime by given them a little German goodbye when they check out!  That might remind them that they need to watch their tongues.  I don't think this is a typical situation.  You've got some people who aren't being nice. My sister is very heavy set and loves Vietnamese food.  Once she was in a favorite restaurant and got her check when she was finished.  At the top, the server had written "Fat American woman" (in Vietnamese), so she could remember what customer it was.  She has a great sense of humor, so she took the bill up to the cashier and said in Vietnamese, "The fat American woman is ready to pay!"  The cashier was totally embarrassed, and I'll bet that waitress got a talking to.<br>  <br>  I know some Hutterites.  In fact, my daughter's husband is from an ex-Hutterite family.  They are really nice people, but anyone who lives "outside" society like that might get funny misconceptions about others.<br>  <br>  It depends on the colony how far they go in education or things like that. There isn't much of a denominational authority.  I know one colony that decided to do a lot of modern things, and since they all agreed that they like the communal life, they just stayed Hutterite and made the changes.  Their kids go to college, but they plan to use their skills to help the community.  I can imagine that other colonies might just be ingrown groups of weirdos, and most in the middle.|`|c0a5c8943ce6f1d0df1e342f2f780150aa	yes! There is a large group of Amish where I am from, and a settlement of Mennonites where I live now. Hutterites a little farther west. these people are the stingiest, cheapest, two-faced,most dishonest, low-down and rude people I have ever had dealings with!!!<br>  <br>  Isn't that funny?!...and they are notorious shoplifters!|`|p3aC2oe2aa	Next time when you hear them go over to them and ask IN GERMAN  'how can I help you?'|`|YX4y4vCfaa	As much as they like to pretend their pure they sure break allot of their rules. TV and radio, alcohol, drug abuse and dealing, an apparently making fun of people in german.<br>  <br>  I like hutterites though. And for all they make fun of other people I'm sure they get it ten times worse.<br>  <br>  The funniest thing I've ever seen is a hutterite man give his wife a mouth full. Later on at his house he sat down at the table with his hat on and I guess she saw this as an opportunity for revenge and absolutely smashed him in the back of the head.<br>  <br>  People often think the women have no say on the colony but just wait until you get inside the house. That's their domain and you go by their rules even if your the head of the colony.|`|0ZfZulnzaa	Ever since I was young we have lived near a few large colonies. The German they speak is derived from Austrian German, but they have changed it throughout the years and added some English and some Slavic words, so basically it is their own language. <br>  <br>  As for contact with colony members, they would shop in the town I lived in, I would buy eggs, chicken and vegetables from them throughout the year, they would drop it off at my house and it was very businesslike, give me what I had ordered, take the money and thank you and leave. They have had a bad rap for shoplifting, and yes there can be quite a few instances of shoplifting, mainly for things like makeup, feminine hygiene products and things they are not permitted to have at the colony. They pay cash for everything, they do not take out loans or credit, they may have a credit card,  but you can be guaranteed it is not carrying a balance ever.  <br>  <br>  My friend Lydia left the colony when she was 16 and has never been back, she does get to see her family on rare occasions when they come to where she works, but the contact is very strained and very limited, it is more for her Mom to see that she is okay and for Lydia to see that they are all okay, it is very odd to see, they act like she is not their family member at all, but that is what happens when you leave the colony, you are basically shunned, but you can go back, you can ask to be accepted back into the colony and most times they will allow it.<br>  <br>  It is surprising that they are saying things that are so out of character for them, it must be younger generation and there must not be any of the elders around, it would not be tolerated for them to behave like that. <br>  <br>  In regards to the education, yes they do go to Univ, and some are even females, and if they do go on they take something that is going to benefit their colony, like it stated Teaching etc. <br>  <br>  "I Am Hutterite" by Mary Ann Kirkby is one of the best books you will ever read in regards to life in a Hutterite Colony. <br>  <br>  I have since moved away from Southern Saskatchewan where I would see the Hutterites daily, and now live in Northern Saskatchewan, we do have a few colonies up this way but I rarely see them.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no bud dont judge....we have quakers nearby....they are secretive|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	I used to live a block away from a house of Hutterites who had left their colony to accompany one of their women who was attending Medical School to become a doctor. They always seemed like good, nice people.<br>  <br>  I know there was a standing invitation for anyone to stop by their house and hang out with them. Seems pretty nice to me.<br>  <br>  Edit: You are thinking of the Amish, apparently. The Amish don't go past 8th grade. These people were hutterite.|`|9480b47d53181b325473487c60b671daaa	We have a colony fairly close that has a lot of members down here to sell chickens and eggs.  I know in the stores it is a general rule if they come in to watch them like a hawk as they are well known to stuff their pockets with the merchandise. They all seem fairly friendly though. <br>  <br>  Their eggs and chickens are touted as  all natural which is great - if they were halfway fresh. The one c store I worked for got eggs from them and a lot were basically rotten. The chickens were small and enough of those were bad right off the truck I won't buy any of thier goods.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	are Hutterites related to the Hittites? just curious<br>  <br>  yes, not to be a Hutterite means you're just not cool (LMAO!)|`|YfwgvPaCaa	MY MAIDEN NAME WAS HUTTER! <br>  The story of my dads history is that someone of the Hutterite faith was an immigrant in the early to mid 1700's or 1800's. He left his group because he fell in love with someone of the french hierarchy. They were secretly wed and she had twins by him. She was put in a convent and the children were given to him and he was given secured passage to the Americas, some money,  and to never return or he would be killed or imprisoned. He lived in the Americas for several years where he came to the gulf coast near Louisiana (which is now part of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana). He remarried and had another daughter and then a son. That son married a Native American and from there some of the records are lost. He settled with a small group of Hutterites for a few months but they knew what he had done and was banished. He kept the name Hutter and that is where I get my maiden name. I was looking them up on the net one day. They are a little more stranger than the Amish and less accepting of others. I met some many years ago and they did seem a little stand offish and seemed to cast their noses down on many people as they passed. I was intrigued by them that I tried to talk to a couple of the elder women, being tolerant of their belief, just to ask what a Hutterite was and to tell them that my last name is Hutter. They were very stand offish and I even asked if I must speak to an elder of their group. They said that they were busy and that I had no right to ask them or anyone of their beliefs. I grew up around the Amish and had never been treated like that by them and the Amish were much more open to giving me a better understanding of their life and belief. Go figure.

Xa39FlV0aa	Yes I do believe in life after death. But I think it depends on how we are now, as to how our life will be after this. Live a good life, and care for others.... you will have a life better than you can imagine. Live a bad life here, hurt others, make bad choices.... you will not be happy.|`|7J9Eb3VCaa	I don't think anyone knows what life would be like or if there will be anything at all. Most people choose to believe in a religion to help them with those answers. I don't think anyone wants to believe there isn't anything. Personally I'm agnostic so I just believe something is out there. My friend once had kind of a silly idea, she said whatever we believe will happen after death will happen. So whatever religion or belief you have will be what happens after we die. So if you believe you will go and ride unicorns or something lol that will be what happens. Kind of a silly idea but cool to think about. I think once people start dying around you whether it's people you care about or not, you start to believe in life after death to feel better about losing them. Death becomes more real and inevitable. Thanks for asking this question it's interesting to hear what others have to say about life after death.|`|vAMKuJl8aa	nope <br>  <br>  the end is the end<br>  <br>  right now i am in heaven and hell all at once.. everything i love and enjoy are here and everything i hate and am afraid of are all right here.<br>  <br>  close your eyes, hold your breath and think of absolutely nothing for 30 minutes and you will feel like you are falling off of the planet because you will be petrified in fear. but that is how it is.. you are going to die and that's it.|`|joA5Rcyzaa	yes i do, not in heaven or hell per say. but i have had many paranormal experiances and you just cant explain them all and so yes i do believe something lies ahead but no one knows what|`|h6cYQaxYaa	Yes I do believe.

KcVvHS4daa	No. Let people  have their beliefs, but schools shouldn't teach some of their sciences. Their textbooks teach kids about evolution and not of its holes. They teach it as if its a fact. Thats just like teaching religion.|`|2eztcCO0aa	There's nothing wrong with teaching comparative religions.  I think it would actually help if people could be educated about what different religions teach and what their followers believe and practice.  It should be part of social studies.<br>  <br>  But I think it's wrong to assume that everyone wants to be taught whatever religion in predominant in the community.  It's not right to assume that every kid in school just need to hear the "good news" to become a good Christian and therefore a good citizen or that is isn't harmful to those who don't follow that religion.  <br>  <br>  And creation should definitely not be taught as a part of any science class.  That's very wrong if for no other reason that it prevents the students from learning good science and can actually make their lives harder if they want to become doctors or scientists.|`|ymrRwZr3aa	Taught, yes.<br>  <br>  Educating, not forcing a certain religion upon students; there's a huge difference!<br>  <br>  If the "theory" of evolution can be taught, then surely religions can as well.|`|4fcfd8a8f44a8a699f24377b8eaed7baaa	No.

4bf36f9c9bff39ba50d483fc6a727ca2aa	La misa es la representación de la última cena de Jesús. El sacerdote es quien la celebra y hace las veces de cristo, durante la liturgia y la consagración de la hostia que es el cuerpo de cristo.También el sacerdote representa a Cristo en la eucaristía y ofrece la comunión. Este rito es tradicional. La ubicación del sacerdote a la derecha del altar tiene que ver con la idea que,  como el sacerdote es representante de Jesús, este debe ocupar el lugar de Jesús y el lugar es  "a la derecha de dios padre" tal y como recita el credo católico: "...subió a los cielos y está sentado a la dereha del dios padre, desde ahí ha de venir a juzgar a los vivos y a los muertos...", esa el la razón.<br>  <br>  A través de la historia de la humanidad, las personas zurdas, es decir aquellos que tienen más habilidad con las extremidades izquierdas, han sido vistas con reserva y a veces con miedo. La palabra "siniestra" designa la extremidad izquierda pero su uso ha adquirido otras connotaciones como, diabólico y perverso, aunque no son estas las razones por las que el cura está a la mano derecha del altar, pero sólo durante la lectura del evangelio. Recuerda que durante la consagración el cura está en la parte central.<br>  <br>  Bye|`|5qO7bH38aa	no voy a misa porque soy cristiana y no se pero el pastor de la,iglesia  esta en centro|`|7185cc89585f769cd97e893c31d24fedaa	pues siempre el saserdote se para en el centro y los monaguillos a los lados.|`|8c4440c151123b46548e8e2a9f83212faa	Tal vez de lo que hablas es el atril donde lee la palabra del dia, no de donde esta el altar principal.  tal vez tenga un significado especial, en la biblia siempre se tiene mucha importancia al lado derecho tal vez sea eso|`|zZ5jI6KKaa	Porque en el centro van los mu?ecos que adoran|`|2oRHy8hBaa	Hola:<br>  <br>  Será por que no pueden estar en el centro de tanta cosa deleznable que pasa ultimamente.....está buena tu pregunta.<br>  <br>  Un saludo cordial|`|3dEHVDJ6aa	se sabe que en las iglesias nunca dan el sermon en el centro por falta de respeto a los supuestos dioses que creen tener pero se que lo dan ala derecha puesto que la biblia dece que jesus subio y esta sentado a la derecha del padre.|`|WxDT7L3maa	SE SUPONE Q PQ JESUS ESTA SENTADO A LA DERECHA DEL PADRE COMO LO ESCUCHAMOS EN EL CREDO...

El que esté a la derecha simboliza el lugar que toma Jesús respecto al Padre.

96866bd9dc2d3f906f72b821ab436829aa	Personally, I think that Jesus told Judas to turn him in to the authorities because it was necessary to fulfill prohecy... I have compassion and understanding for what Judas did....|`|znt2s3sMaa	In a way.  I mean, God chose Judas to be His vessel of wrath, even before he was born.  God chose Judas to be the one who betrayed Jesus.  <br>  <br>  We can look at this two different ways....we can hate him because he betrayed the Lord Jesus Christ, or we can look upon him with compassion, because of what God chose for him to do. <br>  <br>   He WAS doing God's will, even though it was for the betrayal of Jesus...that was God's plan for him, and God's plan for the world for their salvation.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, someone had to do that job, and so I do feel compassion for Judas for being the one who was chosen to do that-just as I would feel sorry for anyone else whom God chose for that job.|`|sYuTNoEJaa	Judas was not predestined to murder Jesus..........he wasn't born for that purpose.<br>  <br>  The prophecies merely tell you that it will happen --- not that it's fate or destiny.  He had free will and exercised it and, as far as we know, he didn't repent.<br>  <br>  Compassion?  Yes - because he was a person - but he betrayed Jesus.    I hope he repented.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	Yes. Judas did the right thing. Jesus was going around claiming to be god, which was illegal and Judas like the responsible citizen he was notified the authorities.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	the guy from the bible or the band? <br>  the guy from the bible kinda, the band not so much|`|2SzYXPrHaa	Yup.  Feeling bad for Judas, and his no-win situation, is what started my path away from Christianity.|`|9DW9irIGaa	yes, he was remorseful after he betrayed jesus. many betray jesus and do not repent.|`|JqtPN2kjaa	Yes, I am a devout Christian and although he is the biggest traitor. God uses all things for his good. So even Judas's betrayal of Christ had its purpose.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no....Jesus said it would be better if he was never born..|`|XEBpv9gwaa	yes|`|AxQmd4flaa	If you ask me, Christians ought to cannonize Judas. <br>  <br>  After all, none of the alleged prophecies would have been fulfilled had he not turned in the Christ. So, Christians have Judas to thank for his deeds - without him, who would have turned in the Christ to the priests?? <br>  <br>  Judas was a needed part of the literature. It is unfortunate that history has been so unkind to this person...|`|aZvWDxqvaa	No. Both Judas and Peter betrayed Jesus. The difference is Peter repented of his sin and Judas did not. Judas does not need to be pitied. He rejected forgiveness, which he should have learned in the three years with Jesus, and took the coward's way out.|`|533z6lWpaa	Yes, I do.

Harvey Milk paved the way for gay politicians and activists everywhere.  <br>  <br>  And to answer your question, without risk, there is no reward.|`|oDdXpghDaa	Nope - especially if you run in an urban area.  Rural area, ummmm... well, you might not want to come out until you get elected, but urban, it's cool.  <br>  <br>  As great as Harvey Milk was, remember though, if you want to be a politician you have to speak for EVERYBODY not just the GLBT community - so you can't be a one issue candidate, you know?  That being said, you'll find gays and lesbians care as much about healthcare, keeping the evironment clean and children having a good education as much as the heterosexual population does.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	Gay politicians are becoming more common (there are 3 out congress people now) so I don't think you'd be any more at risk than being an out gay anything else.

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	I've never heard of anybody objecting to the NWT because it is a literal translation! The objections arise due to the way the translators twist some rules of Greek grammar in order to appear to justify their rendition of certain emotive texts (John 8:58 where there is no precedent in Greek syntax to allow a present indicative to equal a perfect indicative, as the NWT translators imply). Or due to the cumbersome Americanisation of the English language. Or because of the addition of words to the text that do not clarify the meaning, but that change the meaning (Col. 1:16-17 where 'other' has been added four times). This has resulted in paraphrasing certain phrases, in contradiction to the translators claim, "We offer no paraphrase of the Scriptures" (John 15:1-11 where the Greek 'en' is inconsistently translated 'in' part of the time, and 'in union with' the remainder of the time - a paraphrase.) Or they object to erroneous rendering of Greek words (Mat 25:46 where the classical idea in vogue 300 years before Christ is chosen to translate 'kolasis' as cutting off, instead of the 1st century meaning of punishment).<br>  <br>  If I thought for a second that you were genuinely interested in learning why many Christians object to the NWT I would detail examples, but it is absolutely guaranteed that you will choose a Jehovah's Witness answer that concurs with your own view.|`|k03dYskYaa	Some people only trust the King James.<br>  I also agree with Gina. People think it's different because the name Jehovah occurs in it over 7,000 times. They may fail to realize His name has not been added, but RESTORED.<br>  <br>  Scholars have praised the New World Translation:<br>  <br>  One scholar is Jason David BeDuhn, associate professor of religious studies at Northern Arizona University in the United States. In 2003 he published a 200-page study of nine of “the Bibles most widely in use in the English-speaking world.” His study examined several passages of Scripture that are controversial, for that is where “bias is most likely to interfere with translation.” For each passage, he compared the Greek text with the renderings of each English translation, and he looked for biased attempts to change the meaning. What is his assessment?<br>  <br>    BeDuhn points out that the general public and many Bible scholars assume that the differences in the New World Translation (NW)?are due to religious bias on the part of its translators. However, he states: “Most of the differences are due to the greater accuracy of the NW as a literal, conservative translation.” While BeDuhn disagrees with certain renderings of the New World Translation, he says that this version “emerges as the most accurate of the translations compared.” He calls it a “remarkably good” translation.<br>  <br>    Dr.?Benjamin Kedar, a Hebrew scholar in Israel, made a similar comment concerning the New World Translation. In 1989 he said: “This work reflects an honest endeavor to achieve an understanding of the text that is as accurate as possible. .?.?. I have never discovered in the New World Translation any biased intent to read something into the text that it does not contain.<br>  <br>  Edit: Jehovah's Witnesses are not the only ones who use the New World Translation. I have placed it with many people who did not want to become one of Jehovah's Witnesses. I have seen people in Christendom reading it as well. Bible scholars have examined it and praised it. It has won awards and admiration.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	I think the main reason is because they put Jehovah's name back into it while all the later translations have been taking it out.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	That's because they haven't read that translation and follow what other people think or say about it. Other people think that is "wrong" because of many of the terms that are used in the NWT such as Hades.|`|0l1ZairMaa	Sure they do.<br>  On many occasions when we offer to share a scripture with the householder, they will say "I don't believe in your Bible...it's not the same as the 'real Bible."  <br>  Of course we politely explain that "our Bible" as they call it, is actually the same word of God that they read in whatever translation that they are accustomed to...then we compare the meaning of the scriptures and they realize it's saying exactly the same thing.....ONLY in a clearer and more concise way.<br>  <br>  Our New World Translation is easier to understand, because it's written in the language of TODAY.   And most of all it bears The Creator's name  JEHOVAH!|`|5pB2QAPUaa	I know for a fact that the New World Translation is only made a target by opposers of Jehovah's Witnesses because that is what of what they here in there Churches. They have not actually read it for themselves along with there own Bibles. <br>  <br>  People may forget that from the late 1800's till about 1960, Jehovah's Witnesses studied and distributed the King James or American Standard Versions worldwide. All Witnesses I know have a collection of various Bibles. Bible truths do not depend upon a 'false translation' as posters here put it.|`|HGPxEhMSaa	May i take this opportunity to point out in th KJV , John 1:1 &2 ?<br>   1In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. <br>  <br>   2The same was in the beginning with God. <br>  <br>  The NWTsays in John 1:1 , The word was a God .<br>  Thinking about verse 2 , which translation makes more sense ?<br>  Was the word God as in KJV V1 or was the word with God V2 ?<br>  The NWT makes more sense to me .<br>  The point I am making is was the word God or with God ?<br>  KJV is confusing , NWT is clear .|`|dlNxIFCcaa	My experience in life is if it is easy or different there has to be something wrong with it.  I love the NWT.  It is easy to read and understand.  I do use the older version of the KJV.  I don't study with it because I don't do well with the old Kings English.  It is good to have in ministry as alot of people have it in their homes.|`|AA10671142	I love our bible, it is much easier to read.

Satan has truly blinded and is still misleading the world.  If only they would/could open their eyes and see the truth.  It truly would set them free.|`|7lDzcZu7aa	By customized do you mean that Jehovah's name is in it 7000 times?|`|FZM15NXtaa	It seems like those who don't like the NWT keep quoting from the same superficial sources, although their objections have been met with more serious and updated scholarship, for example, the objections to the NWT's translations of John 1:1 and John 8:58.  People need to read what more objective and unbiased Greek scholars have said about these verses.  That is, if they really want the truth.<br>  <br>  There is no reason for the NWT to uphold Trinitarian teachings, because the Trinity is not a biblical dogma.  Yet, most of the objections against the NWT are connected with the failure to teach the Trinity.<br>  <br>  Funny how those who condemn the NWT for "adding" God's name to the New Testament some 200 times, although there is at least circumstantial evidence that it should be there, do not condemn other Bible translations for actually removing God's name from their Bibles over 7.000 times, although the name is clearly there in the Hebrew text.  Where is the outrage over that?<br>  <br>  Most of the objections to the NWT are religiously biased and not based on the merits of the NWT as a translation.  Regardless of who translated it, or their level of academic accomplishment, the NWT has been judged -- by unbiased scholars -- to have merit.|`|Xt9wIj4Iaa	People don't like the NWT because it exposes false teachings that have been entrenched in Christendom for centuries. Just like the Pharisees of Jesus' time, Christendom today is more concerned with the "traditions of men" than the unadulterated word of God.<br>  <br>  People also don't like the fact that, in general, the average JW is more proficient with the scriptures than a member of Christendom - or even their clergy. So since they don't have the ability to prove to JWs their beliefs from the scriptures, they resort to attacking the NWT. In this way, they have insulated themselves from any logical JW argument.<br>  <br>  Despite the claims of some that the NWT translators are trying to mislead people, all of the aforementioned scriptures - John 1:1; John 8:58; Colossians 1:16,17; John 15:1-11; Matthew 25:46 - contain footnotes. Rather than trying to pull the wool over people's eyes, the translators actually draw people's attention to these verses, letting them decide for themselves whether or not they are translated properly.|`|gASz3hDWaa	To counter Sam C's  and 'Beans' point of view answers they gave condemning the validity of translation of the NWT Bible:<br>  <br>  The King James Version translation renders the verse John 1:1 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."<br>  <br>  The New World Translation renders the same verse:<br>  "In [the] beginning the Word was, and the Word was with God, and the Word was a god."<br>  <br>  Some reference books argue strongly that the Greek text must be translated, “The Word was God”, however not all agree. In his article, “Qualitative Anarthrous Predicate Nouns: Mark 15:39 and John 1:1”, Philip B. Harner said that such clauses as the one in John 1:1,<br>  <br>  “with an anarthrous predicate preceding the verb, are primarily qualitative in meaning. They indicate that the logos has the nature of theos.” He suggests: “Perhaps the clause could be translated, ‘the Word had the same nature as God.’” (Journal of Biblical Literature, 1973, pp. 85, 87)<br>  <br>  To the point:<br>  <br>  The absence of the definite article (ho) in the second occurrence of the word theos before the verb in the sentence in Greek is considered significant. Translators who insist on rendering John 1:1, “The Word was God,” do not hesitate to use the indefinite article (a, an) in their rendering of other passages where a singular anarthrous predicate noun occurs before the verb. Thus at John 6:70, The Jerusalem Bible and King James both refer to Judas Iscariot as “a devil,” and at John 9:17 they describe Jesus as “a prophet.”<br>  <br>  Of the NWT’s rendering “…and the Word was a god” at John 1:1, Metzger states it “is not justifiable” and “entirely in accord with the Arian theology of the sect.”<br>  <br>  Dr. Jason BeDuhn, states of the NWT that its “translation of John 1:1 is superior to” the other translations he considered. He continues, “It may well be that the NW translators came to the task of translating John 1:1 with as much bias as the other translators did. It just so happens that their bias corresponds in this case to a more accurate translation of the Greek. ... The NW translation of John 1:1 is superior to that of the other eight translations we are comparing. I do not think it is the best possible translation for a modern English reader; but at least it breaks with the KJV tradition followed by all the others, and it does so in the right direction by paying attention to how Greek grammar and syntax actually work.”<br>  <br>  Several other bible translations render John 1:1 in a similar manner:<br>  <br>  1808 “and the word was a god” - The New Testament, in An Improved Version, Upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome’s New Translation: With a Corrected Text, London. <br>  1864 “and a god was the Word” - The Emphatic Diaglott (J21,interlinear reading), by Benjamin Wilson, New York and London. <br>  1935 “and the Word was divine” - The Bible—An American Translation, by J. M. P. Smith and E. J. Goodspeed, Chicago. <br>  1978 “and godlike sort was the Logos" - Das Evangelium nach Johannes, by Johannes Schneider, Berlin.
829672b4778c9f3596abc049c291e532aa	Describing Wicca, or indeed any of the Pagan religions, is difficult. In my opinion, a person is a Wiccan if he or she practices are certain type of witchcraft. Different traditions include different aspects to their rituals but most notably there is the veneration of the Lord and Lady or God and Goddess, casting of the circle, The Three Fold Law, and the infamous phrase “As it harm none, do as you will.” Most who call themselves just ‘witches’ don’t adhere to all of those things. Beware, ritual and law is played fast and loose among the Pagan/Wiccan community, even neighboring covens will have different theology. The trick is to find your match.<br>  <br>  Pagans as a whole practice a earth based religion, although not all to the same extent. Depending on where you fall there is a mix match of different Gods, Goddesses, spirits, entities, and divinity. Everything from the Greek, Celtic, Norse, Native American deities to the idea that all gods are the face of the same supreme power. Beliefs will differ from person to person. Death is also played fast and loose and you will get everything from reincarnation to souls returning to the Summer Lands, a version of heaven. All life is venerated at all levels. This may mean that you choose not to eat meat or simply recognize that animals sacrifice.<br>  <br>  There’s more. Boy is there more. I suggest you hit a library or book store. Look for books that focus on Paganism. Books that feature just Wicca or Witchcraft will merely tell you how to use magic and not give you a whole lot on the religion. Finding a book that gives you a run down about all different Pagan religions would be best. I hope you find your spiritual match and safe journey on your path.

While I respect Cunningham, I found that particular book very unhelpful.  He tells you what tools you have to buy to be Wiccan, the basic philosophy, and the words to say, but doesn't teach you anything about our personal magickal energies.  If you go by only that book, you will be making meaningless gestures.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend Christopher Penczak's The Inner Temple of Witchcraft.  He teaches a year and a day of energy exercises, magickal mediation, and building a connection to the goddess and god, and stresses that you don't need tools, which seems to be an obsession with many other writers.  Cunningham and a lot of others teach as if you pick up a wand, say the right words and you automatically become Wiccan.<br>  <br>  People will also tell you to avoid Llewellyn.  I will never understand this, as practically every Wiccan book ever written is published by them.  A lot of the non-Llewellyn books contain curses and other manipulative magick.  The only rule of Wicca is to do what you want as long as you harm none, so those really aren't Wiccan books at all.<br>  <br>  Never, ever pay anyone to teach you over the internet or in a coven.  There are classes you can take that are reputable, but make sure to ask around first.  A respectable coven, however, will never ask for money to join.  Avoid any coven that starts talking about curses and having power over people.  There are a lot of people out there who use the word Wicca as a buzz word for having special powers.  Wiccans do not have any special powers.  Everyone has the power to tap into natural forces of magick, but few do.<br>  <br>  Please ignore all the morons who will tell you that it's Satanism, evil, blah, blah, blah.  I assure you that these people have never taken two seconds to actually study the thing they slander.|`|dtrYjyYZaa	<a href="http://www.magickaschool.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.magickaschool.com/index.php</a>|`|ZcVkqwkcaa	I'm not a wiccan, but I have wiccan friends and i do follow some parts of their religion/path. . .Harm none and do what tho will (more in depth but that's all I'm writting atm cause I don't have the time, just google wiccan rede).<br>  I plan to follow their holidays (as in they have 8 that the majority follow) when I do start observing holidays again (atm I just thank that goddess/god that I'm alive everyday and that gifts that they bring thru nature).<br>  <br>  They do have a god and goddess, balance is key in that veiw point.  What god and goddess are choosen most I couldn't tell you, just that there is a goddess and god. <br>  <br>  There's more out there, I suggest just going to any search and type in wiccan and they're more then likely give a brief run down on what that person thinks is wiccan.|`|jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  I hope the following helps iut.<br>  <br>  01. Wicca is an oath-bound mystery religion, each Wiccan should either be Dedicated or Initiated as a Wiccan to be considered a Wiccan by their peers and/or the general Wiccan community.<br>  02. Wiccan’s are polytheistic, honoring a variety of gods and goddesses.<br>  03. Wiccan’s are also dualistic, seeing individual deities, at least to some extent, as aspects of one God and one Goddess.<br>  04. Wiccans are also pantheistic do some degree or another, viewing divinity as immanent within the natural world.<br>  05. Wicca encompasses the practice of magick even though many Wiccans don’t practice magick.<br>  06. Wiccan’s show religious devotion to the Goddess and/or God (depending upon Tradition).<br>  07. Wicca’s ethical basis is expressed in the Wiccan Rede ("An it harm none, do as ye will"), and the Threefold Law ("What ye send returns three times over").<br>  08. Wiccan Ritual usually involves casting a circle as the basic setting for spiritual and magical work, as well as emphasizes the Platonic four elements of earth, air, fire and water and some form of gender polarity, be that theologically in the image of the God and Goddess, and/or mundanely in the physical gender of participants as well.<br>  09. Wiccan’s more often than not incorporate some form of the "Great Rite" (union of the God and Goddess), frequently symbolized in the blessing of the ritual wine by the conjoining of the athame (ritual knife) and chalice (ritual wine cup).<br>  10. Wicca as it is known today with two cc’s came into being in the mid 1940’s, it was popularized in the mid 1960’s. But Wicca itself originates from Pre-Christian pagan belief system from all over Europe. Some (not all) Traditions in Wicca also incorporate the use of ceremonial magic, high magic and even Alchemistry which also predates Christianity<br>  <br>  Blessed Be<br>  <br>  Nyjh|`|dFBccLExaa	The places I see recommended the most is witchvox.com and wicca.timerift.com. They both have a lot of info on them. You could also start by reading up on it. Anything by Scott Cunningham is a good bet. <br>  Wicca is a religion that was created in the early 1900's. It's a nature based religion that draws from traditions of early polytheistic religions. It has heavy emphasis on duality between the god and the goddess, and has a threefold rule involved, which is kind of like karma. Also, it's good to note that not all Wiccans are witches, and not all witches are Wiccan. While witchcraft and Wicca can go well together, it's not an absolute rule that it must. <br>  You can email me if you have any more questions.|`|4OjLMQ6Yaa	I am not Wiccan but you can go to <a href="http://www.witchvox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com</a> and read up on the articles there. In short it is a nature based religion and some Wiccans honor a god and goddess. Sadly there isn't enough room here to go into great detail.
rcgoZIefaa	Sorry to ask but do you go to church???? well, if not there is a heaven and a hell and God made us to be in this world with purpose....you can read the Bible if you want Genesis the Revelation and even the whole Bible....the Bible has the answer to your question....We will go to heaven if we accept Jesus Christ as our God and personal Savior and to learn more about Him go to Church.|`|Ijl20aZ3aa	I believe there is a Heaven and a Hell, and those who believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again will go to Heaven to live with God for all of eternity, and those who do not believe that Jesus Christ died and rose again will go to Hell, where there is not so much as a dead petal from a rose (which is from God because He made it), meaning there is no sign of God in any way whatsoever.|`|dqhb6T73aa	It is a very complex thing to imagine nothingness, since you are dead you will not see black as some imagine, you really can't imagine seeing nothing, I just think YOU yourself don't experience anything, you simply don't exist, it's like before you were born.|`|5MtOAJ7Baa	<a href="http://www.sidroth.org/site/News2?abbr=rad_&page=NewsArticle&id=7613&security=1042&news_iv_ctrl=1186" rel="nofollow">http://www.sidroth.org/site/News2?abbr=r...</a>|`|A1yHDCwxaa	None of the above.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

elefAyGWaa	Eh, it might be a little bit trite at this point.  But fads are always doing this, getting caught up and turned mainstream and then fading out until it becomes a minority again.  It gave kids something to identify with, and still does to a lot of kids until they grow older and realize how to better express themselves as actual people rather than a pop fashion trend sheep.  It started out as original, but now it's pretty mainstream.  But that's okay, it's just part of the whole cycle of trends and what's taken up by the youth of the times.

fysEkCIUaa	Yes It is always considerate to ask the person before using them as a reference. Next time you see the teacher, just say hey I'm putting in some more applications can I still use you as a good reference?|`|AA11822877	Generally once someone agrees to be a reference it is okay to use them as often as you need to. However, it is polite to let that person know so they aren't taken off guard should they receive a call regarding your application. <br>  <br>  Besides, you never know if that reference knows someone at the company you are applying to and can put a good word in on your behalf. <br>  <br>  Once I told one of my references that I had applied for a job and I didn't realize that my reference knew the owner of the company.

That would be polite and then she wouldn't be surprised if she did happen to forget.|`|J5zj8dWRaa	Always ask before using someone as a reference, even if they already said yes.  For one thing, it's the polite thing to do.  For another, it gives them a heads-up in case someone calls them.<br>  <br>  As for how long to use someone as a reference - Use them as long as they are relevant to the application you're filling out and as long as they currently know you.  You wouldn't use a high school teacher on a job application 5 years from now; they wouldn't know you or be able to give witness as to how you would perform on the job you're applying for.  However, you could use a friend for as long as you know the person and they can act as a good character reference.<br>  <br>  Good luck on the apps!

Any person can devise a test, or make an observation.

k03dYskYaa	Proverbs 16:18 "Pride is before a crash, and a haughty spirit before stumbling."<br>  <br>  Humility promotes learning.<br>  The humble try to view themselves honestly and objectively, acknowledging their imperfections and their lowly position before God. (1?Peter 5:6) What is more, they recognize—and even rejoice in—the superior qualities they see in others. (Philippians 2:3) Hence, they do not become bitter with envy or consumed by jealousy. (Galatians 5:26) It stands to reason, therefore, that genuine humility fosters good relationships with others and contributes to emotional security and stability.|`|yOK32PM9aa	With me, it depends on the company I keep.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	Are you of the mind that humility is accepting yourself as less worthy than someone else? Surrendering your will and your freedom of choice to anyone else?<br>  For me that's not humility. There is no one, No one better than you. But there is no one, No one less than you. You can be anyone's teacher and they yours.People come and go in our lives all the time. Were you openminded enough to learn the lesson they had for you. Listen more than you talk. Live a life that you can look anyone in the eye and not fear judgement. And don't judge them, for everything you see wrong with them is a mirror of yourself.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Humility is not about self-deprecation.  It's about acknowledging HONESTLY ones strengths and weaknesses.  If you are good at something, humility ironically enough requires you take a reasonable pride in it and that you do it for the benefit of yourself and others, while if you are bad at something, humility requires you to step aside so others can help.|`|tx4bRDrXaa	I like to think of what Jesus said.<br>  (Luke 18:10-15) “Two men went up into the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. 11?The Pharisee stood and began to pray these things to himself, ‘O God, I thank you I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. 12?I fast twice a week, I give the tenth of all things I acquire.’ 13?But the tax collector standing at a distance was not willing even to raise his eyes heavenward, but kept beating his breast, saying, ‘O God, be gracious to me a sinner.’ 14?I tell YOU, This man went down to his home proved more righteous than that man; because everyone that exalts himself will be humiliated, but he that humbles himself will be exalted.”|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Well personally I find that I have a great deal to be humble about.|`|cpOtr6Thaa	I'm not trying to preach at anyone is saying this, it's just how I try to live my life. <br>  <br>  Being humble is about thinking of others over yourself, understanding others, giving to them what they need (if I can), minding my own business, not thinking myself greater than I am.

(Gé 14:18, 22.) Es el primer sacerdote mencionado en las Escrituras; fue sacerdote con anterioridad a 1933 a. E.C. Como era rey de Salem, que significa “Paz”, el apóstol Pablo lo llama “Rey de Paz”, y de acuerdo con el significado de su nombre, “Rey de Justicia”. (Heb 7:1, 2.) Se cree que la antigua Salem fue el núcleo original de la Jerusalén posterior y que su nombre se incorporó al de esta última, a la que a veces se llama “Salem”. (Sl 76:2.)<br>  Pablo resaltó una característica notable de Melquisedec cuando dijo que ‘estaba sin padre, sin madre, sin genealogía, sin tener principio de días ni fin de vida’, pero que ‘había sido hecho semejante al Hijo de Dios y permanecía sacerdote perpetuamente’. (Heb 7:3.) Melquisedec nació y murió como todos los humanos. No obstante, no se mencionan los nombres de su padre ni de su madre, no se hace referencia a sus antepasados ni a sus descendientes y las Escrituras tampoco registran información sobre el principio o el fin de su vida. Por lo tanto, Melquisedec fue una prefiguración adecuada de Jesucristo, cuyo sacerdocio no tiene fin. Así como Melquisedec no tuvo ningún predecesor ni hay constancia de que tuviera sucesores para su sacerdocio, de forma similar Cristo tampoco tuvo ningún sumo sacerdote que lo precediera, y la Biblia muestra que nadie le sucederá jamás. Además, aunque Jesucristo nació en la tribu de Judá y en la línea real de David, su ascendencia carnal no afectó su sacerdocio, ni tampoco influyó en que concurriesen en él los puestos de sacerdote y rey. Esto llegó como resultado del juramento que Jehová hizo..|`|UKCwofUEaa	la verdad no entendi tupregunta...lo siento....!!!|`|VHAmWsWTaa	Viendo tu avatar, no me extra?a que estés furiosa contra las religiones, y las ataques, no importa cuál sea la causa.|`|ZzriUnANaa	bendiciones<br>  lee tu la biblia para q tendas el saber <br>  no lee para disernir no para contender <br>  el sacerdote es sacerdote de DIOS antes q ablaan y el bendijo a abraan y a DIOS lo bendijo leea tu eso<br>  yo te bendigo y soy cristiano <br>  lee HEBREOS 7. y beras la verdad de tu pregunta<br>  BENDICIONES|`|f1d0c8282d55604ce58ddd7dd88cafb8aa	Me encantaría hacerle esa pregunta a Benedicto XVI...<br>  y por cierto, quien realmente quiera la respuesta que me mande un mensaje.

Melkizedek era en realidad Shem Ben Noaj, Sem el hijo de Noé, y nadie le instruyó el sacerdocio, sólo él.<br>  Melkizedek no era más que un rey que se autoimpuso en los vestigios de una ciudad llamada Salem (recordar que el Diluvio destruyó todo) que los románticos quieren hacer pasar por Jerusalem.<br>  Pero Shem tenía una virtud: su padre Noé la trnasfirió el conocimiento que aprendió previo al Diluvio y era el único que conocía sobre Dios. Abraham (que era Profeta y descendiente de la familia de Noé) sabía esto y pasó a saludarle y de paso, darle cosas para que tuviera qué comer y de qué vivir pues Abraham era rico y Melkizedek, el rey, era pobre. No fue un diezmo ni una ofrenda lo que Abraham entregó a Melkizedek. <br>  El "sacerdocio" de Melkizedek desapareció tan pronto murió.<br>  La tribu sacerdotal que posteriormente instituyó Dios a partir de los hijos de Jacobo-Israel no tienen nada que ver con Melkizedek. Fueron los descendientes de Levi, Moises y Aarón, los padres de la clase sacedotal de Israel.<br>  Comparar a Jesús con Melkizedek es una grave ignorancia del cristianismo, y una contradicción tribal, porque un sacerdote no puede ser Mesías (está claro que el Mesías es descendiente de otra tribu, la de Judá, y no de la de Levi).<br>  Esto solo es parte de las increíbles contradicciones del cristianismo.<br>  Y bueno, si insisten que era sacerdote ?con qué derecho nos lo quieren imponer como Mesías?<br>  Saludos.|`|405a1ca203a5291b46bc3baa6019e74caa	si tu sabes o crees saber que no hay conparacion que importa que otros crean o comparaen a estos dos personajes  ademas creo que el andar buscando comparaciones asi es de fanaticos que no estan conformes ni crren realmente en algo o algien|`|5N2bhNsXaa	Hasta hoy en día hay personas que coparan a Jesus con quien sabe quien...Pero que bueno que te tomes tu tiempo para estudiar la biblia tal vez recibas una revelacion un dia de estos.

When acted upon, it alienates every individual from God. Only through faith in Jesus Christ is the relationship restored.<br>  <br>  "Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned— for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <br>   But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>   Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.

They even hate each other, over little things like religion, culture and genetics.  Just look at Rwanda, Sri Lanka and Iraq.  Would you like to trade places with them?  Do you want to live the experience of a non-white in a white ruled world?  Having a few double standards against us doesn't compare to the racism many of these people face their entire life.  Entire countries and continents suffer because of the white man.  Many times they are justified to be suspicious of white people.  It is wrong for us to think that every black person is a criminal or every Muslim is a terrorist.  It is also wrong for non-whites to think that all white people are evil and racist.  But I can understand why any person that feels marginalized by society can blame the mostly white people that run our governments, courts and businesses. I can understand why they may have a prejudice towards white people.  There is finally a black man in the White House and countries like China, India and Brazil are making a big impact on the global scene.

Just because you don't hear it doesn't mean it's not real.  Basically, we label anyone crazy who doesn't match our definition of reality.  Go figure.  I don't think they put them in the asylum unless they are a danger to themselves or others anyway.  What if everyone in the population except you heard the voices, then who would be the crazy one?  Would you still think it wasn't real or would you think there was something wrong with you that you couldn't hear them?  What if we were all born without eyes but a person was born who could see.

Porque citas el diluvio. El arca de Noé existió y también el diluvio fue uno de los acontecimientos más pasmosos que ha vivido la Tierra, desde que Jehová creó a la primera pareja humana.<br>    <br>  Pero déjame decirte y aclararte que en ningún lugar de las Sagradas Escrituras se cita que los dinosaurios se hayan extinguido durante el diluvio.  Antes bien, los dinosaurios vivieron y se extinguieron antes que se formara el primer ser humano.  No hubieran podido sobrevivir los humanos con tama?as bestias.<br>  Cito un fragmento de un artículo que puede darte luces sobre el tema...<br>  ?Cuándo vivieron?<br>  <br>  Los dinosaurios desempe?aron un importante papel en la vida sobre la Tierra hasta que se extinguieron. Los estratos de roca que contienen fósiles humanos siempre aparecen por encima de los que contienen fósiles de dinosaurios, lo que lleva a muchos científicos a concluir que la especie humana apareció en la Tierra después de que los dinosaurios desaparecieran.<br>  <br>  A este respecto, el libro Palaeontology, de James Scott, dice: “Hasta las especies más primitivas de Homo sapiens (hombre) vivieron mucho después de que desaparecieran los dinosaurios [...]. Aun tomando en consideración los fenómenos de plegamiento de la corteza terrestre, las rocas que contienen fósiles humanos siempre aparecen por encima de los que conservan huesos de los enormes reptiles denominados dinosaurios, por lo que se desprende que estos últimos pertenecen a una época anterior a la de los restos humanos”.<br>  <br>  En el valle del río Red Deer, hay un estrato de roca sedimentaria que contiene huesos de dinosaurio. A este le sigue otro de color marrón purpúreo, que perfila el contorno de la ladera. Por encima de este puede verse un estrato de limolita con fósiles de helechos subtropicales, lo que indica que el clima era cálido, y al que siguen varios estratos de carbón. Más arriba hay capas de tierra de grano más grueso y en ninguna de las capas superiores se encuentran huesos de dinosaurio.<br>  <br>  El libro A Vanished World: The Dinosaurs of Western Canada (Un mundo extinguido: los dinosaurios de Canadá occidental) dice que “en la región interior occidental, las once especies principales de dinosaurios [...] cesaron de existir aproximadamente al mismo tiempo”. Este factor y el hecho de que no se han encontrado huesos humanos junto a los de dinosaurio son la razón por la que la mayoría de los científicos han llegado a la conclusión de que la era de los dinosaurios terminó antes de que aparecieran los seres humanos.|`|92tITjK3aa	pues si!!<br>  tal como dice e indica la ciencia!!<br>  si no fue un meteorito....<br>  fue una desglaciación!!<br>  Aclaro!! desglaciación!!! no diluvio de cuento chino!!|`|PG3aNkieaa	Y tú crees en los dinosaurios? es impresionante como unos juzgan a la biblia como poco creíble pero a la vez creen en cosas de poca credibilidad como la evolución. Una cosa es cierta los científicos no han podido comprobar que la vida llegó por etapas evolutivas sino que siempre que fue producto de algo espontáneo. Por lo demás hoy hay muchas especies distintas, porqué todos no estamos en una misma etapa evolutiva? si el hombre es la escala superior, porque hay tantos seres que viven de lo más bien, incluso mejor que el hombre, en su ambiente y al mismo tiempo?. Zuertte.|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Los dinosaurios todavía existen, aun no se extinguen por completo. Lo que pasa es que habitan nuevas tierras que nosotros aun no conocemos pero que ya están por descubrirse, así como han descubierto grandes animales gigantes en el mar, así descubrirán a los dinosaurios y mas cosas que nunca hemos visto, pero en diez a?os aproximadamente se empezaran a descubrir y si no me crees, cuenta la fecha desde hoy y de aquí en diez a?os lo comprobarás aunque puede ser antes de esa fecha, te lo digo y es una realidad, yo no miento.|`|jAE1viDRaa	Q crees tu de historia? siempre te van a faltar una hojas, normalmente te cuentan lo bueno, nuestros padres hacen alarde siempre de lo bueno que fueron, lo temprano que empezaron a trabajar y lo muy trabajadores que son. Si la Biblia no contiene a los dinosaurios, es porque la historia ha probado que en Israel, Palestina y esos lares no los hubo, y lo del Diluvio es hipótetico, una parábola digamos, 40 es una simbología, al igual que los 40 a?os en el desierto y los 40 días en ayuno y meditación.  También existe los gigantes como corrobora NatGeo, muy similares a los angeles que se detallan en la Biblia explica tu eso a ver!. Es un pueblo muy creyente y asi manifestaban su fe, sino esta es porque no les era importante tratarlo, o encontrarías en un libro de historia una respuesta de matemáticas.

As you entered the tiny apartment, there was a small 5’ x 5’ foyer. If you kept going straight, you went through the doorway of the bedroom. and directly across from that was the bedroom window. Under the window was a TV set angled diagonally to face the head of the bed, which was to the left of the doorway, against the wall. There was just enough leftover room to be able to walk around the three sides of the queen-size mattress, with two bureaus.<br>  <br>  I spent my first day tramping all over London, and that night I was flopped across the bed in my street clothes, reading maps and tourist info to decide what to do the next day. I was facing the window with the TV set, which was off. <br>  <br>  At one point, I glanced up from my reading material to think about my plans and noticed someone reflected in the dark TV screen. Apparently there was someone standing in the foyer behind me, looking into the room! I was startled, a little frightened at the idea of an intruder in the apartment, and in a millisecond, I felt my adrenaline kick in and spun my head to look in the foyer. There was no one there, and when I spun back to re-look at the dark TV screen, it was blank, the image gone. With my heart racing, I took stock of the experience and recalled seeing a man standing in the foyer, wearing a white wig and, I guess, an outfit from roughly the 1700s. He was only visible from roughly the mid-thighs upward, and he had his hands clutched together at chest level, as he turned back and forth as if scanning and assessing the room.<br>  <br>  I did not feel any presence at the time, and wondered if my eyes had played tricks on me, but I couldn’t see anything reflected in the TV screen that I might have mistaken for what I remembered seeing. The adrenaline surge kept me a little “up” for the next 20-30 minutes, so I got up and got something to eat, but eventually undressed for bed and slept. I didn’t think about it again until the next night.<br>  <br>  The next evening around 6, 7pm, I got in after walking for about 6 hours around London and walked directly from the front door to the bed, tossing my coat aside before I flopped perpendicularly across the bed, face down and facing away from the foyer, toward the window. Immediately, while the bed was still rocking back and forth from my flopping, I heard what I can only describe as five rapid footsteps, distinctly crossing the wooden floor, then a slight pause, and I felt an intense wave of cold energy sort of “fall upon” my body all at once. In my mind I suddenly thought “Someone’s jumped on top of me!” although there had been no physical sensation of weight. <br>  <br>  It seemed as if my entire body was energized, as if all my molecules were vibrating, and it felt cool, not quite cold. Although I was hearing no noise, I felt like I was “buzzing” and I felt someone wanted me to leave, to get out. I didn’t feel threatened, just someone wanted me out. I didn’t “belong” there.<br>  <br>  I wasn’t in shock, or even upset. though I was amazed. And I had the presence of mind to take a deep breath and in my head, start repeating to myself “It’s OK. I’m just visiting. I mean no ill will. I will be leaving in a few days. I am not a threat to you.” over and over for a few minutes. I visualized myself protected, and tried to project a safe, calming energy outwards. <br>  <br>  The sensation of the “energy wave” began to fade, and was shortly gone. The entire episode lasted less than three minutes, and for the rest of my stay, another three days, I felt, saw and experienced no further activity.|`|y7EoXgeXaa	kinnof a ghost.<br>  but not in person. <br>  it was through a dream.<br>  <br>  my mom's friend's dad died.<br>  and i had a dream the night it happened and i was talking to my grandpa [whom i had never met before because he died before i was ever born] and he told me to tell this man related to my moms friend to not get on a plane cause the plane would crash.<br>  the morning after i told my mom and she thought that was incredibly strange.<br>  <br>  two weeks later, my mom's friends, husband died in a plane crash.<br>  i don't know if it was a coincidence or what, but i think i had an encounter with a ghost.|`|BhzCW1rYaa	What we call ghosts reside in the 4th dimension, which is the spirit world and we can't see into that world unless there is a portal or the veil between worlds is thin..<br>  All dimensions have a different vibration, we are surrounded by dimensions we cannot see, but sometimes we do get a glimpse into their world and sometimes they get a glimpse into our world; also remember our dimension is the only dimension where time is measured...<br>  <br>  I recently read about a ghost scream which was recorded in England; a team of paranormal researchers were conducting an investigation into a haunting and 3 or 4 women were together in a room when they were taken by surprise by the appearance of a ghost, so they screamed...<br>  The Ghost also must have been taken by surprise as it also screamed, which was recorded on their equipment..<br>  They had the recording analysed and the result was that the scream was not of human origin; so you see we can spook the spooks just like they spook us...<br>  <br>  About 1 km up the road from me is an old manse called St Cecilia, this is in Peterborough, Sth Aust...<br>  This old manse hosts 5 ghosts, and the most prominent is the ghost of one of the old Bishops who lived there in the 1870's..<br>  A friend of mine is a psychic medium and he has been on a couple of documentaries which concern haunted places in Australia, and he has been filmed there several times...<br>  I walk past St Cecilia's 4 times a week, mostly at around the 9ish PM mark, but sometimes much later on my fitness walk..<br>  I have personally seen the Bishop 3 times, up on the porch on the far left hand side of the the building...<br>  Every time I walk past the manse all the hairs stick up on the back of my neck and I have that feeling of being watched...<br>  Every-time I have seen the Bishop, he is looking directly at me and it sends a shiver straight up my spine..<br>  He knows my energy and I know his, I just hope he stays where he is, as I honestly believe that there is something a wee bit sinister about him...<br>  <br>  I will tell you what happened to me when I first moved into my cottage in the country..<br>  One night I got outta the shower and was drying myself in the lounge room and all of a sudden I was freezing cold; I was as cold as if I were naked and out in a blizzard...<br>  I found my winter sleeping clothes(trackie daks, thermal T-shirt and a wind-cheater) and my thick woolly Pancho and I was still shivering; the temperature in my lounge room was 26C so I should have been quite comfortable in just a pair of shorts; the entity had changed my body temperature...<br>  This happened on 3 separate occasions and I contacted a psychic medium mate of mine and we sent him to the light..<br>  He was an adolescent child who was just having a bit of fun, but that fun could have killed me as it is not healthy to be all rugged up in winter clothing etc when it is in fact really quite warm inside the house....<br>  I still have one entity, and he causes me no dramas at all...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|KyLinbX9aa	yes im a medium i see spirits or ghosts everyday in the form of a person they arte just people who get lost and need guidance and help   it just like talking to a normal person but not everyone can see them|`|8jK33jK1aa	Yes,  in our old house.

I was laid on the sofa when all of a sudden a strange noise started coming from my stereo.  <br>  <br>  Now this in itself was strange as it was a seperates stereo and the cd changer and amp had both gone off for repair that day.  Without the amp nothing else worked (all the wires went into the back of the amp)<br>  <br>  It was the record deck on top spinning faster than anything I had ever witnessed before.  The arm lifted slowly went slowly to the middle of the rubber mat (All the time I was pressing the on off button and was also stood there with the unplugged wire in my hand!!!!!!)  the needle reached the middle the arm shot up returned really fast to its original place the turntable stopped instantly.

You really shouldn't think of labeling it bisexual or "bicurious" because you are a human being and humans are sexual.

KXQVRQdjaa	Even if the Christian god did tell his people that he created the world by speaking in just six days, we have to remember that the people back then would have never understood the concept of one-celled organisms and natural selection.  He said lots of other things that we know today to be simplifications of science told to people who had no way to understand what the truth of it was.  The arc could have been made with electro magnets with the technology of the time, but try explaining that to the ancient people.  No way was he going to try explaining the role of ions in lightning storms.  <br>  <br>  There are plenty of Christians who acknowledge that the Bible has a lot of mythology in it: not meant to be taken as fact, but as fables and symbols.  A lot of Christians think god created life by starting evolution.  Being a Christian doesn't have to mean being blindly ignorant of science.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Quite the reverse!!<br>  <br>  The Pope, Catholic Church, Church of England and mainstream churches all accept evolution and the big bang!!<br>  <br>  Lord Carey the former Archbishop of Canterbury put it rather well – “Creationism is the fruit of a fundamentalist approach to scripture, ignoring scholarship and critical learning, and confusing different understandings of truth”!!|`|tx4bRDrXaa	There is the Genesis account that tells us clearly what happened.Then we have the scriptures written by Paul,Paul was not a stupid man he was well versed in the law,He was a Pharasee and belonged to the Sanhedrin his had a Roman citizenship which meant he was well aquainted with all the paganizm around him.He was also a lawyer and this is what he said.<br>  (1 Corinthians 15:39-40) Not all flesh is the same flesh, but there is one of mankind, and there is another flesh of cattle, and another flesh of birds, and another of fish. <br>  Demonstrating that they do not evolve or mix they are all in a class to themselves.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Genesis 1:24|`|WQvqLnnhaa	Yes...

sayfQB2aaa	I live in Australia I'm almost 15 and a buddhist, I became buddhist last year when I was at a Christian School. It's hard some times when your close friends believe your going to burn in hell but you have to remember that buddhism is about being happy in the now and i don't think theres anything greater than that. You can email me if you want to talk. I'm going to post some of my favorite quotes and teachings: <br>  <br>  The greatest wisdom is seeing through appearances.<br>  <br>  The greatest action is not conforming with the worlds ways. <br>  <br>  Conquer the angry man by love. <br>  Conquer the ill-natured man by goodness. <br>  Conquer the miser with generosity. <br>  Conquer the liar with truth. <br>  The Dhammapada<br>  <br>  The only reason we don't open our hearts and minds to other people is that they trigger confusion in us that we don't feel brave enough or sane enough to deal with. To the degree that we look clearly and compassionately at ourselves, we feel confident and fearless about looking into someone else's eyes. <br>  Pema Chodron<br>  <br>  View all problems as challenges.<br>  Look upon negativities that arise as opportunities to learn and to grow.<br>  Don't run from them, condemn yourself, or bury your burden in saintly silence. <br>  You have a problem? Great. <br>  More grist for the mill. Rejoice, dive in, and investigate.<br>  Bhante Henepola Gunaratana<br>  <br>  Although gold dust is precious, when it gets in your eyes, it obstructs your vision.<br>  Hsi-Tang<br>  <br>  My religion is to live and die without regret.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, <br>  but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.<br>  <br>  If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the present moment, we miss everything. When a child presents himself to you with his smile, if you are not really there - thinking about the future or the past, or preoccupied with other problems - then the child is not really there for you. The technique of being alive is to go back to yourself in order for the child to appear like a marvellous reality. Then you can see him smile and you can embrace him in your arms.<br>  <br>  Live in Joy, In love, <br>  Even among those who hate. <br>  <br>  Live in joy, In health, <br>  Even among the afflicted. <br>  <br>  Live in joy, In peace, <br>  Even among the troubled. <br>  <br>  Look within. Be still. <br>  Free from fear and attachment, <br>  Know the sweet joy of living in the way. <br>  <br>  Pay no attention to the faults of others,<br>  things done or left undone by others.<br>  Consider only what by oneself is done or left undone.<br>  <br>  Neither fire nor wind, birth nor death can erase our good deeds.<br>  <br>  Holding on to anger is like grasping a hot coal with the intent of throwing it at someone else; you are the one getting burned.<br>  <br>  Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who said it, no matter if I have said it, unless it agrees with your own reason and your own common sense. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|RGabfWSVaa	you'll receive enough support from your parents unless you're practicing behind their backs , you shouldn't feel obligated to tell anyone .|`|bloGqdBqaa	well, you wanted to be cool and different, now live with it.|`|bK4NxIA0aa	a lot of them are out now|`|IqqaA2wIaa	no<br>  <br>  STICK WITH THE TRINITY CHURCHES....JESUS IS HOW WE ARE SAVED....DONT GIVE THAT UP...|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	It's a difficult time, especially since Christianity has a monopoly of "goodness" in our society that makes you feel even more alienated, and those around you will fill you with a sense of guilt about being some kind of traitor.  You also have a sense of isolation, especially if you live in a rural area, and no one else is around who is a buddhist, let alone, knows what buddhism is even about.  For that reason, it might be a good idea to keep it to yourself to avoid ridicule and questions like, "Why do you worship statues?"<br>  <br>  Ultimately, this struggle is a ripe field for practice.  Keep in mind that no external thing is going to be able to help you with your own mind.  <br>  <br>  From a Catholic point of view, you might begin to understand what Jesus was saying more as you grow through your practice.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  <br>  PS.  One thing I've found is that there are a lot of books out there about Buddhism, but if you are trying to teach yourself, I found that it is helpful to constrain yourself largely to the classics.  There is a reason that Aristotle's and Marcus Aurelius's works still survive after millennia.

ZjXbhLOnaa	Si mal no recuerdo alguien dijo una vez -y creo q lo hizo citando un pasaje de La Biblia- q el orgullo es el peor pecado, porq de el nacen todos los demas... en el caso de los pecados capitales seria equivalente a la soberbia; hermana gemela del orgullo. Porq cuando sos soberbio -u orgulloso- no te importa nada ni nadie y haces lo q se te antoja, y del hacer lo q se te anoja provienen todos los demas pecados, sean capitales o no... Esto siguiendo la doctrina catolica; porq en mi iglesia todos los pecados son considerados igual de malos... pero el mas grave seria el de derramar sangre inocente, o sea asesinato y el negar al Espiritu Santo luego de haberlo recibido. Pero repito, eso en mi iglesia; la mormona (Iglesia de Jesucristo SUD).<br>  Ahora si me das a elegir un pecado capital favorito automaticamente y sin pensarlo me quedo con la pereza; pero no porq' me guste mas q los otros, sino porque SOY RE-PEREZOSO!! De nacimiento!! JEJEJEJEJEJEJE!!<br>  Muy buena tu pregunta; te dejo estrella.|`|51fa9ea20ff3b0d73c77d15413975ee5aa	El orgullo, porque fué lo que llevó a Lucifer a creerse superior que Dios.|`|53dd34bab3ee7b11c33bc726c289702faa	más grave: la soberbia<br>  más tolerable: la gula|`|JLOpaaEAaa	Creo que la pereza, imagina si todo el dia te quedaras durmiendo en tu casa, sin hacer nada, que aburrido.<br>  La gula , ese pecado tolero mas despues de una alka seltzer.<br>  Amigo gracias por el video de felicitaciones, me encanto yo tambien te felicito. te mando un beso.|`|QsbnsqgBaa	Hola Julián:<br>  <br>  La soberbia y la pereza, me caen de la patada y en cuanto a cual toleraría más, mmm dejame pensar La lujuria, ajajajajaja, no te creas, pero quizá la gula.<br>  <br>  Saludos excelente inicio de semana|`|c3fc6bd2bf2523806cba968bc768e2a3aa	Las verdad no hay por cual decidirse por donde quieras que los mires todos en exceso son malos, pero muy malos.|`|de9CYmvCaa	nosotros los evangélicos,estamos todos sonados...no hay pecadito menor, sólo hay PECADO.|`|uollHqTYaa	El mas grave: la ira, poque te puede conducir a hacer muchas cosas sin pensar y de las que después te arrepientes toda la vida.<br>  El que mas tolero: la lujuria... no es tan mala... o si? jajajaja|`|nlJnmYoqaa	Hola, yo pienso que la envidia, ya que a veces por sentir envidia no podemos ver lo hermoso de nuestra propia vida y eso hace que se pierdan de muchas cosas.<br>  Y no me refiero a ese sentimiento de ni?os, sino al sentimiento que tenemos los seres humanos en cualquier circunstancia, hasta la mas boba.<br>  Ejemplo: Si yo tengo envidia del novio de mi amiga, porque es "lindo, guapo y atento" en el fondo puede que ese chico no sea del todo asi y por estar pensando en eso dejo pasar a un chico que me brindaria eso y muchas cosas mas.<br>  <br>  Saludos..|`|oXBIHC7Zaa	La soberbia, porque es el que te impide ver la necesidad de cambiar tu vida. Si eres iracundo pero reconoces con humildad que debes cambiar y pones tu empe?o en hacerlo, lo puedes lograr. Si eres iracundo y sobrebio, aunque sufras las peores consecuencias por tu defecto, nunca te vas a convencer que tienes problemas y no vas a poder cambiar, ni vas a dejar que nadie te lo eche en cara y menos que te ayude. La soberbia es el orgullo desmedido, la sobrevaloración  de uno mismo que lleva al desprecio de los demás y a la negación de la dependencia de Dios.|`|KbezNi7Uaa	el mas grave...matar ......el mas tolerable.................pues todos los demas|`|kyfjpl95aa	La soberbia,,,,,es la madre de todos los demás defectos de carácter, para la religión, son pecados capitales|`|0422364e3b3f0790beea4f989d7b87d3aa	la avarisia que siempre quieren mas de lo que deven o es sano.<br>  <br>  y el que mas tolero la vanidad es lindo que la gente mejore su aspecto.|`|213443a5bc575ef3cd52de7ac22ea054aa	la envidia porque esta genera otras cosas mas graves y delicadas la que mas tolero es la gula esta no hace da?o a nadie solo al que la tiene|`|6DmRxequaa	hola amigito . creo muy a mi parecer que la envidia . es muy mala consejera y de ella se pueden derivar la mayoria de los demas pecados capitales.. saludos|`|7643182b8a641904c53e14398c4aecfdaa	El que practicas sin que tes des cuenta...

Dependerá mucho de lo acostumbrada que esté esa persona a mentir. Para empezar, una persona que dice una mentira suele acercar la mano a su cara: boca, mejilla, orejas... Probablemente no te mirará a los ojos o te mirará demasiado fijamente. Otra pista es el todo de voz, que suele ser más bajo o más alto de lo normal, pero siempre se distinguirá del resto de la conversación. La postura del cuerpo también ayuda (brazos cruzados en postura defensiva, el cuerpo girado...)|`|dlWIm0VHaa	mirandolo a los ojos con firmeza si esa persona miente desviara su mirada de la tuya ya que no aguantara la presion de la verdad con la que te manejas|`|f9lTEwOAaa	si mira hacia arriba es que esta mintiendo ya que esta pensando que mentira decir, y si mira para abajo es que esta diciendo  la verdad (no lo invente, lo lei,supuestamente y q esta comprobado  y todo)|`|jgZCBSfGaa	ma?ana te pago.|`|xLknquZ3aa	Hola!<br>  Yo pienso que por la mirada y por tono de voz. besos|`|425e5d368d672163a5372ce383a70eb4aa	Si le tiembla la voz...lo labios, se les seca la boca, mueven mucho las manos o las tienen en una misma posición sin moverlas.

PvgZUzHjaa	The line is "the love of money is the root of all evil."  There's a big difference there.  Money is a useful tool; ask anyone who has been sufficiently low on money as to be homeless and hungry.  <br>  <br>  There's a big difference between an intrinsic value and an instrumental value.  An intrinsic value is one that is good for itself:  human life, love, liberty, beauty, truth, wisdom, etc.  An instrumental value is good only for what it can do:  money can buy food, pay rent, etc.  It has no value in itself:  it's only good as a medium of exchange for that which is of value.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	it's the lust of money that is the root of all kinds of evil. If you look at the most heinous of crimes you can trace it back to greed, lust or power, if not all three.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	No, christians are.|`|4405cb5dd585bee70aeaf6a964ff0b94aa	Its more of a comparative thing. For example, you take a 30 year old man who is looking for a loan, simple, happens everyday, but he makes less then $30,000 a year. Now take the 30 year old man who makes $300,000 a year applying for the same loan (don't ask me why, just giving an example), if you were the bank, who would you be more willing to trust in that they'll pay it back? This is the concept, who ever has more money, is more likely to be good at doing something. Not sure if that makes sense because I wasn't sure how to word it.|`|oihouY7Naa	Yes it is.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Love of money is|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	No money is not the root of all evil. Money is essential for us human beings. What is the root of evil is the love for money. Because people tend to do evil and wicked things just to have money. When you have much money you are famous.

0KR4wyoQaa	Arabic :D|`|PbrGLvonaa	Basque Language... no other languages related to it... plus they have the coolest surnames :)|`|wTIvLkJSaa	Because I speak Spanish, I can understand spoken Italian and Portugese and read French.  I would have to go with Spanish, because it opens a lot of doors to other languages.  English is a standard.  I tried really hard to learn Mandarin (Chinese) when I was living there, but it's too hard.  It's a tonal language so every sound has 3-5 different ways to say it (for example making the vowel sound like a question).  If you say it the wrong way, it won't make sense.  There are also TONS of different dialects, so people don't understand each other even if they both speak Mandarin and are from diffferent places.  Vietnamese is also tonal and difficult to learn.  Japanese is NOT tonal and easier to learn.  The pronunciation is similar to Spanish for some things.  I don't know.  I would still go with Spanish for being "coolest".|`|SRmNJCdiaa	Well if I could speak three languages I'd keep English, learn French and Japanese.

Make sure you brush your teeth before going out on your date. There is nothing worse than kissing someone with bad breath.    <br>  <br>   If your date consists of having something to eat before the actual kiss, make sure you have a mint on hand to take right after you finish eating. Don't take the mint just before the kiss or chew on gum. You don't want to have something in your mouth when you kiss.<br>  <br>  Moist Lips - You want your lips to be slightly moist when you kiss. Run your tongue over your lips once before you kiss. Don't wear lip gloss because that tends to make the kiss too gooey.<br>    <br>  <br>   And don't wear a lot of lipstick unless you want your partner to wear it too after the kiss. Slightly moist lips makes it easier to move your lips over your partner's and gives both you and your partner a more pleasant experience.<br>  <br>      <br>  <br>       Positioning - Stand close to your partner. As the two of you move closer together tilt your head slightly. If you can see which way your partner's head is tilting, tilt your head slightly in the opposite direction.<br>    <br>  <br>   <br>  Close Eyes - Just before your lips meet, close your eyes. Some people prefer to leave their eyes open during the kiss. But until you know what your partner prefers, it is best to close your eyes.    <br>  <br>  <br>   Open Lips - Open your mouth slightly and place your lips over your partner's lips. Do not hold your breath! Breath through your nose. As your lips meet, press them gently over your partner's. You may wish to move your lips in a slow, circular motion or just leave them still over your partners.<br>      <br>  <br>  Closed Lips - This is like the type of kiss you'd give your grandma or aunt. Instead of opening your mouth when your lips meet, keep them closed. This is also a good way of letting your partner know this is as far as it goes. It also makes a great hello/good-bye kiss or a great first time kiss if you're nervous.<br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  French Kissing<br>  <br>  This is the most popular type of kiss. This involves touching your tongue with your partner's and it can be quite a pleasant experience. There are a few tips to create a great french kiss.   <br>  <br>  <br>      Open Lips - Open your lips over your partner's slightly more than you would during a regular kiss. This makes it easier to place your tongue in your partner's mouth.<br>  <br>  Tongue - Place the tip of your tongue on the tip of your partner's tongue. Do not force your tongue too far into their mouth. If you wish, you can play with their tongue by circling theirs with your own. Have fun with it. Explore.<br>  <br>   Lips - You may explore different ways of using your tongue. Try running the tip of your tongue over your partner's lips. Do this slowly and gently, just using the tip of your tongue.<br>      <br>  Suck Kissing:<br>  <br>  This can be a very seductive type of kiss. Instead of French Kissing with your mouth open, while your partner's lips are parted suck on their top our bottom lip with your own, just for a second or two. Then go back to another type of kiss or try the other lip.    <br>  <br>  <br>  Nip Kissing:<br>  <br>  This type of kiss has to be done carefully, but when done correctly can create a wonderful effect on your date. While suck kissing, gently bite their lip, but be VERY gentle so as not to hurt your date / partner. This kiss should only be done with someone that you've kissed a few times before, otherwise you may shock your partner.<br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  Surprise Kissing:<br>  <br>  This type of kiss is done when your partner is lying down on a sofa or the ground, either asleep or just lying with their eyes closed. Quietly approach your partner and place a small, very gentle kiss on their lips. Intensify the kiss until your partner opens their eyes or awakens.|`|rxfKjMTnaa	Kissing comes natural, go with the flow. Generally however people turn their heads to the right. When it happens, you'll know.

2e06c84d21db358502c752a7100c3c3eaa	To be 'saved' is to be delivered from God's judgment. The Bible says - all have sinned and fallen short. Because you have sin in you, you're born with it, you have to be born again and that's through Jesus. When you accept Jesus by confessing with your mouth Jesus is Lord and believing in your heart God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. What is God's final judgment? Well, for those who are sinners they are cast into outer darkness apart from God's love and his light. This is where Satan and those angels who followed him are destined to go. The Bible says - it is not God's will that any man perish, but have everlasting life.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	That popular "Jesus saves" gospel comes from Paul/Saul who said: "Christ died for your sins."

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

Most have had confusion in life and have found few answers. I was lost but now I'm saved and so on. The life is simpler for some when reigned in by Jesus. It explains so much for them and they have a ready answer in the lord.

AND THEN went to the temple... you'd only be hurting yourself.  No, the temple wouldn't be tainted, but your eternal outcome might be!  No really, the ordinances wouldn't mean anything because you most likely wouldn't keep the covenants you made there anyways.<br>  <br>  I don't know why people want to go there so bad anyways, if they think it's so "bad"... <br>  <br>  I love to attend the temple.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	It's called trespassing and it's illegal.

I hear its along process for new temple goers. Teh film the play and being taught all the new stuff. Seeing the couple go thru th eveil and all. It would be interesting to see first hand.

As soon as the truth of the religion could be detected, then it would no longer require faith, but its superior: knowledge.  There is no way to stack one belief over another.  There are ways to rank one theory over another, but only to the degree that one theory is more supported by evidence than the other.  So, on the one hand we have some that make claims that the world was created by some god 6-10,000 years ago.  On the other hand, we have a scientists claiming that the Earth is 4.5 billion years old.  Scientists have evidence, and are honestly interpreting that evidence.  There is no evidence to date that can contradict this finding.  Young Earth Creationists have an old book.  How do you decide between these competing claims?  Should be obvious.|`|5FL46nZtaa	sure why not|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Convert if proven wrong.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	You assume that a religion can be proven to be 100% true.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

He did not believe what the others was telling him, he wanted to see the proof with his own eyes. Even when Jesus appeared, Thomas still did not believe that Jesus was who He said He was. That is why Jesus told everyone in the room to feel His hands and feet, to prove that He was the Jesus who had been crucified and He had risen from the dead and was a resurrected being.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	Read the passage again, and you will see that your comment is far from the truth.  All the other disciples believed when they heard about Jesus' resurrection.  Thomas , doubted.  He asked Jesus to show him the wounds in his hands.  Jesus said "you believe because you have seen. Blessed are they that have not seen and yet believe".  Not a comment that a ego-centric person would say.  Hanging on that cross dying for the sins of world, did not make him prideful either. Where did you come off with thinking that Jesus had a prideful bone in his body- He humbled Himself, and became obedient unto death, even death on a Cross.|`|IGQw4267aa	LMFAO.<br>  <br>  showboat? hotdogging?<br>  lmfao.|`|JthubNIsaa	Just like man who needs proof to believe.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	Just doin' His job.

AA11672481	I completely agree with what you've said about the bible. I was also raised catholic, and I was always told to either start a family or become a priest. As I grew up, I came to realize the things that you are now coming to realize. <br>  <br>  Please don't think that someone needs to kill you before you commit a sin. You really have made progress. You've started on the path toward balancing your faith with your first hand knowledge that homosexuality is not wrong. In time you'll begin to process what you've already started to witness about people's motivations. <br>  <br>  Faith, in my opinion, is about trusting God even when he doesn't give you all the details. However, some people treat the bible like its God's wiki. If all the answers were in the bible, then you wouldn't need faith. You would simply know the truth about everything. Ultimately, I believe that it's best to leave the spiritual stuff up to God. I just ask for guidance, and I haven't been let down yet.|`|QfPJ4dotaa	Why don't you join this forum for Gay Christians? :]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gaychristian.net/community/index.php?" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychristian.net/community/in...</a>|`|rbXCALUhaa	religion makes no sense.

Touchy, feely with other girls but totally straight. Maybe she considers you to be a close friend and she's comfortable doing these things with you. I'm thinking since this has dragged on for 2 years if she really does like you, why hasn't she kissed you? She's been flirting, grinding, touching and all that so she's certainly not shy. It must be something else.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, she could totally be into you but not up for risking your friendship by taking it further. You could give her a hint or two indicating that you like her and see if she picks them up and acts upon it. But nothing too far and sudden. That might ruin things between you. Maybe next time she tells you she loves you, tell her you love her back. See how she reacts. If she freaks out jsut cover it up quickly. <br>  <br>  You'll have to investigate further to know what she really wants. Best of luck!

I'm in  my twenties and let me tell you girls dance with each other in the clubs all the time gay or stright! I do some of those things with my girls yet I have never been with a girl, and are very much in love with my feanice. But on the other hand maybe the looking into your eyes thing and not letting the young man get close to you is another thing. Maybe she does have a secreate crush on you but she might be to scared to tell you or anyone else because high school is full of drama and you do one thing everyone else doesn't like then all of the sudden no one likes you. I know it happend to me! I wasn't really popular but I wasen't the loser kid either, well one day in PE when I was in 10th grade people stared asking me if I was gay and this was strange to me because I never gave any indication that I liked girls I didnt' even know a lot about girls&girls an boys&boys, then my HS life wasen't all that great after that rommur. So maybe your frind just doen't want to say anything because she dosen't want to lose you or her other friends, or worst maybe she's affraid of rejectoin thinking I have this crush but what if my crush isn't into me! that can suck rathger you like boys or girls! If you really are a true friend and don't really care if she likes guys or girls, just sit down and have a talk with her just the two of you let her know if she is into you that's fine and you still love her, you won't tell anyone but you just want to be her friend!  oh I just read you additional if she does like you maybe the two of you can hook up, but don't forget to keep you friendship frist cuz good friends are hard to come by GOOD LUCK HONEY|`|jiu5m1f0aa	My situation was kinda similar to yours: I was in high school, i was attracted to guys and girls but never really had sex with either. My best friend I was attracted too and I didn't know that she was a lesbian till about 3 years later and at that time I was dating this guy. We had a group of friends and they would all have sex with one another which i didn't care to be apart of b/c I wanted to save myself till i got married. I ended up engaged to my boyfriend and when that happened she started trying to grab my breast and touch me as if to get a reaction out of me ( i guess). no one new i was sexually attracted to women. I did not touch her or let her keep touching me b/c she was still in the party stage of her life and I new it might not have worked out b/c she was not a monogamous person then. Well i got married and found out at 22 that he is not what i wanted it was her. So one day at her house i just went for it and we have been together for almost 10 years.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question is: She probably wants you almost as much as you want her, but she is afraid of what people would say. You should try to go in and kiss her the next time she looks deep in your eyes and tells you she loves you. Not on the lips but on the cheeks just to see what she does. Ask her has she ever thought about being with a female. Also, she is most likely afraid that if you two got involved sexually that it would compromise your friendship. Just let her know how you feel and that you are confused about her meaning of "i love you" since you are a lesbian and all. Plus, let her know that your friendship is long lasting no matter what happens.
4VouLn4waa	idk. im doing an experiment. im not getting baptized. if i die and go to hell ill tell you on my way down|`|JTu1cLkYaa	According to the LDS theology, yes. You just won't be able to enter into the Kingdom of God. You will be in one of the lower kingdoms of heaven.|`|2Hot9EJiaa	You never said if you ever accepted Christ as your Savior.  If you have done that you are in heaven, with or without being baptized. Baptism does not save anyone of us, only Jesus can.  We have to admit that we are sinners. Confess and repent of our sin, and then accept Christ as full payment for our sins- and then after salvation with the power of the Holy Spirit desire to live as God would have you live.  Have you done this? Because that is the way to enter heaven, and have eternal life.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Yes you can. Baptism does not take you to heaven and baptism is not mandatory for that. You need to follow Jesus by having full faith in him and showing your faith through your life. Be compassionate to others, love others unconditionally, keep your mind clean always and submit your life to God. However, to become member of a Christian Church, you will be required to receive baptism. But to enter the kingdom of God, you have to become a good human being by receiving remission of sins through Jesus Christ.|`|au2o1GD5aa	Yes. In the Bible, we learn that Jesus was executed on a cross between two thieves. One believed on Jesus as the Son of God, to whom Jesus said, "Today you will be with me in Paradise."<br>  <br>  Baptism is not a ticket to Heaven. Many are baptized and will never see Heaven. But if you are a believer, and you can be baptized, you definitely "should" be baptized. Jesus ordained baptism, and that's reason enough. <br>  <br>  The real key, though is believing. If you believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, you will be saved (Acts 16:31).|`|P0UHjYwYaa	IDK<br>  maybe just born again of the 'spirit' (your heart).|`|564f663bd843bf78848130c65ab50bd6aa	Did the thief on the cross get baptized?  What did Jesus say about Him?<br>  <br>  You get to heaven by thinking about all of your sins and realizing that God hates each one, and that you deserve to end up in hell forever because of your crimes against God.  What Crimes? Every time you broke one of the 10 commandments, you broke God's law. So you deserve to be punished, just like the rest of us.<br>  <br>  But God did something so you don't have to end up in Hell. God became a man in Jesus Christ, lived the perfect and sinless life, and then went to the cross to suffer and die to pay for your crimes. Jesus died to wipe away your crimes, so you can go free on the day of Judgment.<br>  <br>  The bible says the way to salvation is to hear this good news, and respond to it by repenting of your sins, and trusting in Jesus as your only hope. <br>  <br>  Repentance means you are sorry for your sins, you apologize, and then ask God to help you never do them again.  Repentance is to turn from sin.<br>  <br>  Trusting in Jesus is a step of faith you must take. It's like trusting in a parachute when you jump out of a plane. You don't just believe in a parachute, you put the parachute on and hold on tight. The same goes for Jesus. You hold on to Jesus with all of your life, and you will be saved.<br>  <br>  That's all for salvation.  It is a free gift of God. Just trust.<br>  <br>  As for baptism, it is an act of obedience. God will give you the desire to be baptized after you are saved.  Baptism is a public proclamation that you belong to Jesus and it symbolizes death, burial, and resurrection with Christ.<br>  <br>  So the answer is yes, you can enter heaven with never being baptized.|`|868TSu7Haa	You may disagree with my beliefs but as a Jehovah's Witness I believe that Only 144,000 are going to heaven and the rest of the people will reside here on earth as God intended in the first place so Jehovah's will can be fulfilled<br>  <br>  Revelation 14: 1-6|`|N6cCc9dOaa	No because Jesus said that "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit,he can not enter the kingdom of God.It is in the bible,Gospel of John,chapter 3.verse 5.|`|zD0lCK5Kaa	Yes, baptism is not essential to our salvation.

If I were you I would get baptized anyway to show your commitment to God.|`|rIvp1BToaa	water baptism  is  Only  symbolic  not important  what is  is  spiritual  baptism  from God  read John 3<br>  John 3<br>  Jesus Teaches Nicodemus<br>   1Now there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council. 2He came to Jesus at night and said, "Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs you are doing if God were not with him."<br>  <br>   3In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.[a]"<br>  <br>   4"How can a man be born when he is old?" Nicodemus asked. "Surely he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb to be born!"<br>  <br>   5Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit. 6Flesh gives birth to flesh, but the Spirit gives birth to spirit. 7You should not be surprised at my saying, 'You must be born again.' 8The wind blows wherever it pleases.

Usually people who say this aren't even homophobes or whatever, they just think it's a bit off, and they use the word gay.|`|AA11589320	Maybe if its annoying you, toss back a few stats. Like.<br>  <br>  Did you know that 1 in 3 girls are victims of child abuse. How many of  those offenders would be a gay man. <br>  <br>  Did you know that 66% of child sexual abuse is committed by step fathers plus another 20% know to the victim.  That says almost nine out of ten child abusers are heterosexuals. <br>  <br>  The numbers prove that a child is at greatest risk from males in his own family and then family friend.  That is not gay.|`|1T2qiNIvaa	It's just something people say.  Most people don't mean anything homophobic when they say it.  I just ignore it.|`|fs5M38iBaa	to be honest with you i tihink it has to do with the person. im gay and it doesnt bother me at all. in fact i say stuff is gay all the time. i dont think of it as a derogatory term. now queer on the other hand i hate. lol its funny how different people can feel about different things.|`|m4vN12Psaa	I do take offense to it. When I hear someone that I know say it, I immediately inform them that I am offended by what they said (one of them cutely corrects them-self and says "that's so straight"). <br>  But when I'm in class (which is when I'm at my quietest) and I hear it from someone I don't know, I just keep my mouth shut instead of going into a long argument with them about what they said.|`|rTu4v2Vuaa	it bugs me to the point of screaming, i don't get offended its just the way they say it, and then you get those people who say it about ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!|`|Si83P0Oiaa	I barely ever notice. Sometimes I call stuff gay, or people gay and don't think twice about it, I should probably stop lol.<br>  I find it more offensive when people call things/other people 'homo.'|`|a1hevOG2aa	haha, no im not offended cuz i use it too, its not an offensive way to use the term, the really offensive term is ******.|`|ELZfN4hzaa	I understand where you are coming from.

I don't like it because its used as a negative. You call someone gay, its an insult. You say they did something gay, its an insult. <br>  <br>  I normally just say "That's so straight."|`|m2PlMByKaa	i've been trying my best not to use it but im use to saying it. :(<br>  for example: <br>  <br>  my friend: school is still not canceled.<br>  me: damn, thats freaking gay.|`|GZRHJBT7aa	I think it's just like saying "that's retarded." People don't actually mean it in a literal sense so it's not as insulting as it may come off as, but it's still not the right term to say. However, my bi friend says "that's so gay" so often! And I always tell her that she's being hypocritical, lol. Then she realizes and we just laugh about it. I think it's a big deal if people mean it in a bad way.I think it's wrong to say and I don't say it but I don't think it's that offensive since people most likely don't mean it to be.

gCTbN4Jbaa	All i can say really is"Respect your elders". They took care of you(maybe not you but somebody) when you were weak and small. And now that they need help for whatever time they have left, you should feel honored. I mean, i could never let my mom or grandma stay in a home if i could help it. But my grandma was dieing of kidney cancer, and i saw her while i was pregnant and sick to pieces to drive to see her. I only wish i could do it more often. How would you feel if you were stuck in a permanent hospital where everyone was waiting for you to die? Remembering who you were and who you used to be, and all you have left is that, the memories. And to top it off, your own family that you knew since they were still growing in someones uterus didn't have time for you, so all you can do is waste away in some place where most people can't even have a straight conversation with you anymore? <br>  I say make time for her. And eventually when she has been spent. You can re-figure your schedule again. Make your grandma still feel like somebody, its the end of her life, her final chapter, make it the best!|`|09DE4NG3aa	Just tell her.  Driving an hour away is a big committment to make each week.  Is it possible for your Grandma to move to a home closer to either you or your Mom?  Maybe you could make a committment to ring your Grandma weekly, but visit her once a month?

So...<br>  <br>  things you'll need:<br>  Black candle <br>  A personal item from the person you are casting the spell against <br>  A full moonlit night <br>  A cemetery <br>  Three rusty nails, preferably pulled from a place where someone was murdered, or where an innocent person was buried <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are the steps:<br>  Step1:  Dress in black clothing and go to a cemetery on a full moonlit night. Bring with you a black candle, three rusty nails as previously described, and a personal item from the person you are exacting revenge upon. The item should be something that can keep the person's image in your mind. <br>  <br>  Step2:  Find a grave that is old. Ideally, it would be the grave of a murder victim. Kneel on the grave, facing the tombstone, and push the three rusty nails into the candle, vertically, one right under the other. Make sure you put the nails close to the top of the candle. <br>  <br>  Step3:Light the candle and place it on the grave in front of you. Hold the item belonging to your victim with your right hand. <br>  <br>  Step4:Stare into the flame of the candle and chant this spell, "You have won your evil game, but now I see you in my flame, dark forces gather in dark place, dark forces now be in your face!" <br>  <br>  Step5: Concentrate on the person's face and let the hate build up as you say this chant each time a nail falls out of the candle. You will say this chant a total of four times, once for the lighting of the candle and once for each nail.|`|DxDfa3E7aa	"Awaken your powers"? That's a bunch of bull. Turning to black magic instead of good magic is your decision, but whoever told you that needs to rethink what they know. I'm a Wiccan, and the power to use magic lies within us all. If you truly and under good reason wish to use magic, you can do it as you are. But guessing by your details, magic isn't your answer. Contrary to popular belief, magic can't fix everything. You never use magic for your own personal gain or it won't work. It seems you just need to look inward for your answers.|`|LnB9U8Fbaa	good luck, email me if u find out how.|`|1Ad7jJgwaa	First, you must dye your hair black. To be one with the darkness, you must think like the darkness. Wear a long black cloak that you may hide in the shadows with.

Enroll in one of those wonderful Tai Chi classes, and Ms Wong will teach you the art of the Tickling Butterfly. It's the PERFECT premise for dark magic to spew forth from and consume the world in a FIERY bliss!<br>  <br>  Now that you've become darkness, and your fingertips are itching with delicate prowess... you may now begin channeling the dark arts. Stack a large and protected bon fire in your backyard, not near or under anything that might catch fire. Take a bottle of Lightus Fluidus, proven to really get things going, and strike fire into its depths. Walk around the fire, feeling its warmth, and scream... YESSS! LIVE! BREATH! FIRE OF THE EVE!

So I think maybe you should realize that there's really nothing you can do to shape the future other than keeping a positive and motivated attitude. That "black magic" stuff is nothing but a way for people to think that they have control. I think people like the idea of it because it's like saying you have power over what's going to happen to you on a large scale (especially when things are not going so great) and that's just never going to happen. The reason your "spell" didn't work before is not because you haven't "awoken your powers" but because (drumroll please) they never work. Nope, never.

El sexo es una necesidad básica, y como tal, debe ser satisfecha regularmente. A diferencia de las otras necesidades básicas, como comer, respirar, dormir, etc, uno puede pasar más tiempo sin sexo en comparación por ejemplo que sin respirar, pero a la larga se empieza a deteriorar el equilibrio que todos tenemos por la falta se sexo. Las religiones que ponen trabas o tabúes al sexo lo que buscan en realidad es un mayor control sobre los individuos, aparentando cierta "pureza" del alma con la "castidad" y cosas por el estilo. No promuevo la promiscuidad ni nada que se le parezca, por si alguna persona carente de criterio quiere catalogarme de eso. Tampoco el libertinaje ni la infidelidad. Pero si estás en pareja, y existe química, es natural que haya sexo. Y la religión no tiene derecho a meterse en tu vida privada. Uno debe rendirle cuentas a Dios solamente, y el día que te toque. Mientras tanto uno debe obrar de acuerdo a sus principios, respetando a los demás. Sería mejor que las religiones se preocuparan de ayudar a combatir el hambre, la pobreza, las guerras. Esas cosas matan gente de verdad, y es peor la inacción que la acción misma, a veces.

o5zY17Eeaa	Muchas mujeres piensan que lo ideal seria entregarse el dia de la boda.Si todos los hombres estuvieran preparados de tal forma, que pudieran hacer el dia de la boda,el mas feliz en la existencia de su novia,eso seria lo ideal.Una mujer puede estar muy enamorada,pero eso no quita que en su primer contacto sexual,pueda sufrir la mas grande de sus decepciones.Ahi precisamente comienzan los problemas,cuando la novia ilusionada,emocionada por hacer realidad su sue?o,casi asustada,al entregarse,ve que todo se le viene abajo,que su principe azul no es mas que un ogro desconsiderado y que ese bello sue?o se le convierte en pesadilla.Es muy bella tu actitud  de querer entregarte el dia de la boda,es algo que habla muy bien de ti,pero saber a lo que vas seria una buena forma de comenzar bien tu nueva vida. Por no ir a ciegas, a probar cuando no hay vuelta atras,<br>  es que muchas personas tienen relaciones antes de casarse.Claro si no sienten compatibilidad con el que seria su pareja,despues de dos o tres veces,tratan de terminar la relacion sin casarse ya que de ninguna forma duraria.<br>     Claro eso queda a tu eleccion, ya que puedes tener una formacion que se ri?a con la idea de tener relaciones sexuales antes del matrimonio.Respetando tu decision creo, que es mejor probar antes,para que no nos queden los remordimientos ni los consabidos porque no lo hice antes.<br>     Suerte.|`|C0N538cwaa	Tabú...

2hitJVLiaa	I don't know where all the money goes, alot of things in mormonism are secretive until you become highly involved. I love mormons, as do I love all people. They are highly structured have great family values, work hard in their preaching and would become really great christians. Yet, their later doctrine is suicidal. My grandma always said, "It's a great religion to live, but not so great when you die." I can't help but agree. The problem with tithing is it was enulled and done away with according to Hebrews 7. It was only given to the a particular set of tribes to give another tribe help because they had no inheritance. After Christ died, the thithing law was done away with among Mose's Law and now has become a Jewish Fable. There is nothing wrong with asking for an offering, but when the word tithing is mentioned, it has become a commandment of men, because God does'nt deal with it anymore. Try and get a Christian to understand this... Yet the bible is clear.  "For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof." Hebrews 7:18|`|nZ5rQXXIaa	give us your sources, please.  The church has what is called "The Bishops Storehouse."  This is for those that are in need of assistance.  This is not a permanent solution.  It is also up to the visiting and home teachers to keep in contact with their presidency and the presidencies job to contact the bishop of their ward or the branch president.  We also have other sources to help the elderly, but it is also up to the children of the elderly to assist them also.  The temples, though small in number are not used for church services.  Only for sacred ordinances we temple worthy members take part in.  You are forgetting about the many chapels and stake centers around the world.  There is the "Perpetual Education Fund" that helps those in third world countries fund an education and advance in society and in this way also help their family leave their impoverished ways.  Tithes go to building of not only temples, also they are used to fund the building of new chapels and renovate older buildings to be used for the future.|`|y9ptZmkEaa	I don't know much about Mormons, but it seems like you are asking a good question.

One of the most important things you will ever know [if you take the time] is to learn the roots of your beliefs.  The root source of christianity began with the catholic church in 325 AD after Constantine ordered it to be the official religion of the people.  Your beloved bible was put together by the early church fathers of the catholic church, everything you believe about your savior was given to the christians from the catholic church.

Used only Twice In two Thousand Years<br>  It does not say that a Pope can't be wrong on matters of faith or morals, nor even that a Pope can't be a heretic<br>  <br>  They believe in Pastor infallibility Their pastor speaks to God Himself Who answers them and has a Conversation with them (WORDS OF WISDOM Pat Robertson Benny Hinn etc.) Thousands of sects all with a Different word<br>  <br>  Transubstantiation . Catholics accept Christ’s Words (John 6:53-56 RSV) So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you; {54} he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day. {55} For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. {56} He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him. <br>  And is the same now as the first Christians practiced and believed.<br>  <br>  <br>  They deny Christ’s words John 6:66 and call Christ a Liar. Is that Number a Coincidence.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Mass- Catholics Celebrate Mass and worship Christ 365 days a Year At Mass. And is the same now as the first Christians practiced.<br>  Protestants They have meetings Nothing Holy scream shout and flop on floors while shouting gibberish  52 days Of the year. Something the Jews and Catholics have never done.<br>  <br>  Mariolatry- "Mariolatry" means the worship of Mary, giving her the kind of honor due only to God (Greek: latria). Since Catholics justifiably give her greater honor than they give other saints, but less than they give to God (and not just less, but a fundamentally different kind of honor), Mariolatry does not exist in Catholic piety. In fact, the Catholic Church forbids Mariolatry because it forbids us to worship anyone other than God himself: "Idolatry not only refers to false pagan worship. It remains a constant temptation to faith. Idolatry consists in divinizing what is not God. Man commits idolatry whenever he honors and reveres a creature in place of God. . . . Idolatry rejects the unique Lordship of God; it is therefore incompatible with communion with God" (Catechism of the Catholic Church 2113, cf. 2110–2112, 2114). <br>  <br>  Protestants worship Benny Hinn and his ilk cant wait to send in Money with their Pray request written on them for Hinn and his ilk to place them on a table calling it and alter something that is not found in their so called churches so they can place their holy men of god hands on them to fulfill their request..|`|0itSQ7iTaa	Catholisim is a denomination of Christianity, Christianity is faith and Catholicism is a religion. There are many differences although they both do believe in a triune God, God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. The most important thing that defines a Catholic as a Christian is the belief that God has sent his one and only Son, Jesus Christ to pay the ultimate price for our sins, raised from the dead and ascended into heaven. <br>  <br>  The biggest difference for me is a Christians teaching comes solely and directly from the Bible and only the Bible. The Catholic religion is a man made religion just as many others are. It's main teaching tool is their book called "The Cathecism of the Catholic Church". A Catholic may say the teachings you find in "The Cathecism of the Catholic Church" are based and come from the Bible. Now that's true in some respect. However, because of my background, of being raised Catholic and marrying a Christian I have done my research and have found alot of what is taught is not supported by the Bible. Needless to say I am now a Christian. I have taken a look at both teachings and there are many difference that are very important differences. I would recommend if you would really like to know and understand these differences get "The Cathecism of the Catholic Church" book, a Bible and James G. McCarthy's Quick Reference Guide entitled, "Roman Catholicism What You Need to Know" it goes over the 62 primary errors of Roman Catholicism. This has been very helpful for me to identify the differences. I believe you will not only find it an interesting study, but you will also see why we only need to depend on Gods Word and nothing else. It is why I have chosen Christianity over Catholicism. My experience has also been when in conversation with a Catholic they don't really know the teachings of the Bible (God's Word) and sometimes don't even know the teachings of "The Cathecism of the Catholic Church". They rely solely on the Priest to teach them and never research it for themselves as God instucts us to do in the Bible. God's Word ended in about A.D. 95 he has given us all we need to know. Anything written after that just simply doesn't count.<br>   <br>  The Bible warns us clearly about adding or subtracting anything from his Word...<br>  <br>  For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

Faith alone can not save you. You must do good acts. Other than that, the main difference between the two is that Catholics pray to Mary and various saints as well as God, and that Catholics have more things they have to do or not do during Lent, and that Catholics make the sign of the cross a lot, and that Catholics usually don't talk about their faith that much and Protestants do.|`|syBBnsCAaa	Christian is a wide spectrum encompassing several religions.

G2yUpoqfaa	The answer is yes.  Decretals are included in the canons, and these were dogmas (divine law)  from the Early Fathers who were taught by the Apostles. <br>  <br>  Cicognani, Nuncio to America, has written Canon Law, 2 vols. 1934, which can be interloaned if you really want to understand it.  It is too long to fully quote, but a short summary, beginning p. 43:  <br>  <br>  The Decretists commonly referred to ecclesiastical laws (church laws) as canon law.  Sometimes canons meant laws promulgated by the Pontiff overriding other inferior laws. Trent and Vatican Councils designated definitions of dogmas by the term canons.  It is the Code which refers to disciplinary laws of the Church as canons.  Confusing, yes?<br>  <br>  Dogmas at these two Councils, plus previous ones, promulgated de fide dogma.  Once again divine law is in the canonical law.  Laws on the behavior of the faithful apply directly in regard to divine law.  But the laws are also called canons.  <br>  <br>  These are such valuable books that I have photoed them from the originals to have on hand.

God would not contradict his Word by inspiring such gifts now.

Get away from me, you workers of lawlessness.”—Matthew 7:22, 23.|`|ZE9eTtRhaa	Is there a specific thing about it in the bible?  I'm still not convinced.

So us Christians will never see him!|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Nothing is specific about the end times except the fact, that it will definitely happen.<br>  We are to love and help each other, be aware at all times and pray with all supplication, until this time.<br>  We are also to adhere to the Lord and stay focused on God, regardless what happens in this world.|`|YA36FUf1aa	"Only Christians, no jokes". Isn't that an oxymoron? We are talking about the religion which is based on a book about a carpenter and amateur winemaker who parted a whole sea, was the son of a woman who got f*cked by an omnipotent being but claimed that didn't count as full pentrative sex and had another bit about a bloke who built a gigantic ark which held two of every single animal species in the world without any record of trouble.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	The Antichrist will be someone everyone loves (except those who no better).  As far as the Rapture, some believe it will come before and some believe after, some believe it's already happened etc.  The Bible is not too clear on when, but I think it will happen right before he arrives.  You can read Thessalonians and Revelation to find more about the Rapture.  I would not want to say for sure when it happens, because although it says it does happen, it does not really say when.  The antichrist will be killed and then resurrected, which will make some believe he is God.|`|AA11232725	An anti-Christ is not only someone who works against Christ, but it can also mean a "substitute" Christ. So in all likelihood "The" anti-Christ will claim to be the Lord Jesus. He will use false signs and wonders that God give him power to perform to fool people who don't love the truth.<br>  <br>  2 Thessalonians 2:1  Now, brethren, concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our gathering together to Him, we ask you,  2  not to be soon shaken in mind or troubled, either by spirit or by word or by letter, as if from us, as though the day of Christ had come.  <br>  <br>  3  Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first, and the man of sin is revealed, the son of perdition,  4  who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God.  <br>  <br>  5  Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?  6  And now you know what is restraining, that he may be revealed in his own time.  7  For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work; only He who now restrains will do so until He is taken out of the way.  8  And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth and destroy with the brightness of His coming. <br>  <br>   9  The coming of the lawless one is according to the working of Satan, with all power, signs, and lying wonders,  10  and with all unrighteous deception among those who perish, because they did not receive the love of the truth, that they might be saved.  11  And for this reason God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe the lie,  12  that they all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.|`|TzY9vkinaa	no and no|`|jaoFSXwkaa	No he will not say he is the anti-christ, that would defeat his/her purpose. The Bible says day and hour is not knows, even by Jesus himself, but Jesus told his desiples in Matthew 24:29-31 "Immediately after the distress of those days 'the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give it's light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken.' At that time the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all the nations of the earthwil mourn. They will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory. And he will send his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other." (NIV) Is this the first or second coming of Christ? I don't know. I tend to believe its the first because he is collecting belivers. If this is true than Jesus's words match up with Revelations 6:12 "I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like a sackcloth made of goathair, the whole moon turned blood red, and the stars in the sky fell to earth..." (NIV).<br>  <br>  If all that is true then Christians will see the Anti-christ, although that would not be who he'd be...let me explain. The anti-christ is said to have a wound in the head, but to have a wound, one must be injured. When Jesus came back from the dead he had scars. He will get life again from Satan himself, therefore becoming the anti-christ. So we would know who he is, he just spiritly would not be the anti-christ.<br>  <br>   It is also intresting fact that all central american cultures, nostradamus, and Bible codes all say it will be in 2012. These of course controversal subjects. <br>  <br>  With that being said, the best advise is just be ready for the rapture.|`|OtKCAeQZaa	The anti- Christ is some one (a man) who will see the devil and the devil will teach him what to say to the people.  The Anti- Christ will go about preaching that there is no Christ. That scripture are done away with, and that there is nothing to look forward to. That churches are deceiving the people and that they should be free to do what they want, with out wearing about a god punishing them and many ,many more things will he say that will have the  people believe him. Even the lord elect people will be deceived by the Anti Christ. This is evil to pervert the right of way of the lord. This Anti- Christ will soon come into power and go about preaching that there is no Christ. People will worship him and many will believe on his words .How strong is your faith for you to be able to continue to resist the Anti Christ’s words when he will begin to pervert the way of the lord, will you to believe in him and follow his council, or stay true to the faith and know the Jesus Christ is the Christ and that he will come, as has been predicted . Amen|`|BrjZhySIaa	Prayin 4 Jay is spot on here.<br>  <br>  The Bible says he will be so charismatic and good at what he initially does (which is what earns him the role in the first place), that people will believe he IS Christ himself.  This enables him to draw such worldwide allegiance...from ALL religions...think about that one for a minute.........that's powerful.<br>  <br>  Although, we Christians may know the man quite well prior to the Rapture.  But he will certainly use the Rapture to rally all those 'left behind' under his new global government.  However, we won't know he is indeed the Antichrist for sure.  But we who are informed will probably have a good idea.<br>  <br>  Some Christians will be infatuated with this omnipresent being and the Rapture will actually serve to save these Christians from following the evil entity.<br>  <br>  @jagmarhouse... I love that verse.  It's well worth repeating... <br>  <br>  "Be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." – Matthew 24:44|`|bzsnAC7Iaa	He will come claiming to be Christ. Able to perform miracles in the sight of men. I'm afraid most will be deceived into believing he is Christ. Christ returns at the 7th trump and we will all be changed into our spiritual bodies at that time. If a supernatural entity comes claiming to be Christ, and you are still in the flesh, it's not Jesus. I bet he even claims he's come to rapture you out of here. No rapture, sorry, but God will protect you against harm so don't worry.|`|OBid7Ozsaa	Many people believe that we are entering the final chapter of human history and that Jesus will return soon. That’s a sobering thought, for though the Bible provides a glimpse of heavenly bliss and goodness and surpasses comprehension, it also predicts earthly scenes of incredible bloodshed, horror and death.<br>  <br>  If you have trusted Christ as you Lord and Savior, you can have confidence about the future. A day is coming, perhaps soon, when the Lord will return for you. Then you will return with Christ to share in His millennial rule. After the 1000 years are over, you will live with Him in a new world forever in a life of joy and fulfillment.<br>  Be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. – Matthew 24:44<br>  <br>  But if you are not a Christian, the future is not so promising. The wrath of God will be poured out on the earth, and on you, in a time of terrible war, disease, and famine. Beyond that lies a second death – a fate every bit is real for the unbeliever as heaven is for the person who trusts in Christ.<br>  Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved. – <br>  Acts 16:31<br>  <br>  The countdown continues. The time for opportunity is now. Make your decision. Trust Christ today. Believing that He died to pay the penalty for your sins, ask Him to save you. Only then will your future be secure – both in this life and in the ages to come.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The Rapture is in 1 Thessalonians 4:17, and it is before antichrist takes over. <br>  <br>  The antichrist will deceive some people into thinking that he is God and is a helpful person.|`|49VzNZM1aa	Christian and non-Christian alike will know he has come.

I'd say most people (unfortunately) have a good knowledge of the recession after being affected by it in one way or another. People losing their jobs will have a knock on effect on things like crime rates; lower tax revenues will mean public services are reduced, social discontent will rise, along with suicide rates and the number of people depressed etc..all in all pretty damn bleak.<br>  And as for your 'too many people in the world?' line I totally totally agree, half the problem is that we can't possibly have the jobs, infrastructure etc to support the current global population and the growth rates will spell disaster.

He was perfectly content in Himself.<br>  God created us because He is gracious and kind and generous and big-hearted.<br>  The Bible says "God is love." The expression in the original Greek could be paraphrased in English as meaning "God, as to His essential nature, is love."<br>  <br>  "Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.  God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.  So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.  He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.  He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.<br>    God has now revealed to us his mysterious plan regarding Christ, a plan to fulfill his own good pleasure.  And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ—everything in heaven and on earth.  Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan.<br>  <br>  Ephesians 1:4-11 TLB|`|iblT1HJpaa	To have a full and meaningful life free from the depravity of this world and the only way to come close is to embrace and glorify God in your life.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	The purpose of life is to live a good clean life keeping sin to a minimum and no God did not make us because he was lonely...

Chrisitianity has fought withen its religion and with other relgions, so has Islam.Christianity has persicuted Jews and Muslims and in more recent times black people and gay people. Radical Muslims also dont exactly practice a tollerance for people different from themselves. This would not be currupt if members of these religions who are obviosly not tollerant say that they are. Obviosly most Christians and Muslims are tollerant, but you can not claim that either of these religions are tollerant, throughout history or in modern times. In realtily, the foundings of Christianity and Islam are not cuppupt, but they have become that way because of individuals who are at the top of the realgion are greedy for money and power. <br>  <br>  I also think that you are not a bad Christian fpor questioning your religion when you belive it is currupt or wrong.

yrJQHOOeaa	People have a natural desire to surround themselves with other people who share their beliefs. Religious circles have always seem to be in a "war" for total dominance. Muslims only want their ways to be practiced,  just as Christians, Jews, Hindus, etc. In order to dominate one must suppress individualism and free thinking. Yet with each generation arriving, more and more children are choosing to seek out their own paths. In acts of desperation, religious circles are forcing their beliefs on undeveloped minds through manipulation and fear. In my opinion, there is no "right" or "wrong" way to achieve spiritualism,,, there is just "a way." It is up to each person to find that path which promotes compassion, peace, love, and wisdom.|`|8rwxS60Eaa	I agree with Apple. they need guidance.

k03dYskYaa	I've never saw an episode of Pokemon, because cartoons don't appeal to me that much. I do like the classics (Bugs Bunny, Betty Boop, Little Lulu)<br>  I heard Pokemon has magic in it, and it looks a little strange to me, so I doubt I would personally watch it, just like I don't watch the Smurfs or Casper.<br>  Everyone is different, but I try to stay away from things where spiritism is a theme of a show or movie. At times I have watched things like that, and weird things and noises start happening around my house. No lie.<br>  <br>  This is one of many scriptures that influences thinking on this matter.<br>  Deut 18:10-12 "There should not be found in you anyone who makes his son or his daughter pass through the fire, anyone who employs divination, a practicer of magic or anyone who looks for omens or a sorcerer,?or one who binds others with a spell or anyone who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead.?For everybody doing these things is something detestable to Jehovah, and on account of these detestable things Jehovah your God is driving them away from before you." So many who do not practice magic, would not want to watch others practice it either. <br>  <br>  Many have experienced demon problems when they have had bad entertainment in their houses or watched it. My husband's friend had a bad experience with watching "the Adams family". While watching, he heard a loud scream in his house that terrified him, and no one else was home. He was scared straight.<br>  <br>  My husband brought home a laptop from his job, and I don't know what it had been used for in the past, but we heard a scream in our own house soon after using it. I had felt touches when using it prior to this event, but dismissed them as my imagination. We got rid of the computer and felt a lot better.<br>  <br>  The experience of an individual can make them more sensitive to these things. The most important thing to a Jehovah's Witness is how Jehovah feels about a matter.|`|94aceb82c6668e0fc341436367b2d246aa	You know, I've never heard that.

You mentioned you had to borrow a laundry cart so from now on try to get all of the things you might need so you don't have to ask anything of them. After all who would want to borrow a cup of sugar from people like that? I wouldn't trust them lol.<br>  And if one of them should happen to ask you for anything you say in a sweet upbeat tone "Well how are you? I was so sure I had done something horrible to you in a past life"  And when they ask why tell them how you always spoke but they never did and say it with a smile to put them on the spot.|`|6755d6124814f8a889ed9508dc8b6638aa	The best way to deal with people like that is a smile, a wave, and a loud "hello!".

Perhaps there have been incidents with crime in the neighborhood, and they don't know you well enough yet. I'm sure there are people in your neighborhood that feel the way you do, and would want to be your friend. But those who don't, don't worry about them, there isn't a law that you have to be friendly with your neighbors anyway. However, if it happens naturally, that's great, and you'll be lucky to have that.|`|FJO3quQbaa	I don't get it, you're mad at them for not being friendly, but you're calling them derogatory names in this question.  You don't sound like you really want to be friendly, you just sound mad.  Friendly people are friendly because that's who they are, not because they expect a certain response from others.  You don't know what issues your neighbors may be dealing with.  Have some compassion and leave them alone if they want to be left alone.  You may be forcing this issue.|`|f5a0a0e07a01aef60501ccf660fefa96aa	I truly love going out of my way to be nice to people like that!  It drives them crazy!  lol  Just keep being your friendly self, don't lower yourself to their level.  Hopefully they will come around. As for the older lady, she may honestly be scared, if it were me, I would leave her a cheerful card on her door. She may be lonely you know, along with being truly frightened.

uFAoq4idaa	My biggest challenge is how to forgive and forget the wrong done against me by my daughter-in-law. She is my no. 1 enemy even until now. Many times I want to be good to her but every time I heard about her infidelity I would always burst into anger. I want to forgive and forget her. I told the Lord that I would let her go and see how she will be punished by Him regarding her fornication. Thinking of my son who is in the Middle East working for the sake of their family and here is his wife going out with other man. And this man would come always to their house and play with their two daughters. They were seen by my brothers going out together with the kids, So I can not ask the kids what is happening between their mom and the man because they would side with this man. And the worst is the family of this man especially his mother is always asking money from my daughter-in-law money for her gambling and other vices. We have already settled this in front of my son when he went home last year and she was crying begging for my forgiveness. I forgive her and she promised to be good but lately my brothers had been seeing them together again. I told the Lord that I will forgive her this time but I will also forget her being a part of my family. It's up for my son what to do with her after I told him everything about what his wife is doing now. I will give everything to God and trust Him. Yes God is good all the time. I want Him to erase the pain in my heart and the hatred I have for my daughter-in-law and her lover. I want to free myself from any heartaches. I leave everything to God and free myself from hatred and falling into sin. Every time I found out what they are doing I felt my heart aching and my anger would rise to first degree level. So God help me cleanse me from iniquities and give me a forgiving spirit. This is my prayer always that I might have peace. Thanks for your question it helps me. This give me a chance to pour out my sentiments. Now I have peace inside me. Thank you Lord God!|`|6ELSwKKvaa	The challenge is having to face people who claim to be Christian but are not. The war is not only with people who don't believe in Christ it is also about fighting people who give Christ a bad name or image.

Love them and lead them to the truth and let God work out their salvation. (That is what the Holy Spirit's job is)<br>  <br>    We are to share the "Good News" Which is salvation through Christ and that all sins are not too big to be forgiven.

Las desventajas: una vida llena de paranoias de quién me ve, quién me mira, qué hablan y a quién se lo dijiste "lo mío".<br>  Te daba la imagen de puerta giratoria porque a veces la sexualidad que uno practica en privado es de uno y no tiene por que andar contándolo a los cuatro vientos.

Ever. Usually it is a mental illness, a neurological disease or someone faking it to make their church and/or god look good (usually in front of a bunch of people). It's just not something than can be done, at least in the way that you (or Hollywood) seems to think.<br>  <br>  It would be like trying to put a CD into a tape player. It's just not compatible.

Drug use altered states of consciousness in any form including meditation. Involvement with the occult can bring this type of exposure.  Some people are imbalanced but most who have a demon still have a will but something inside is taking them over, often they resist.  Demons can be cast out in the name on Jesus but if you are not a Christian I would not try it myself; Also if the demon is cast out the bible says he will gather 7 more demons and try to reenter that person.

Did you say unto men: “Worship me and my mother as two gods besides Allaah?”’  He will say: ‘Glory be to You! It was not for me to say what I had no right (to say). Had I said such a thing, You would surely have known it. You know what is in my inner-self though I do not know what is in Yours; truly, You, only You, are the All-Knower of all that is hidden (and unseen).<br>  Never did I say to them aught except what You (Allaah) did command me to say: “Worship Allaah, my Lord and your Lord.”’ And I was a witness over them while I dwelt amongst them, but when You took me up, You were the Watcher over them; and You are a Witness to all things. (This is a great admonition and warning to the Christians of the whole world).<br>  If You punish them, they are Your slaves, and if You forgive them, verily, You, only You, are the All Mighty, the All Wise”’<br>  [al-Maa’idah 5:116-118]

I'm sick of these idiots saying gay marriage will devalue straight marriage.  Are they going to sit up in bed some night and say "Oh, no!  A gay couple just got married!  Our marriage is worth less!"  I don't understand why people can't grasp the concept of "the worth of one marriage is not tied to the worth of any other marriage."  The lack of logic is astounding.<br>  <br>  As for the Biblical argument, that's just dumb.  Hindus consider cows sacred.  Raze the burger joints!  Jewish people don't eat pork.  I guess we have to make it illegal!  No more buttons for us - it's against the Amish religion!  <br>  <br>  There is absolutely no argument against gay marriage.  The only "reason" anyone gives is "I don't like it."<br>  <br>  Listen up, Jeremiah.  Here are your pathetic talking points, and here I am slamming them down one by one with logic and reason:<br>  <br>  "We all have a right to agree and disagree, I disagree with gay marriage,"<br>  <br>  You have the right to disagree.  You do NOT have the right to deny the rights of people you disagree with.<br>  <br>   "having a gay sibling myself, I can see that the rights they want are not consistent with why they say they want them, it all comes down to tax cuts, etc. Not "love""<br>  <br>  Oh yes, gays are robots no capable of love.  Even the ones who have been partners for upwards of fifty years.  Yup, no love there! /sarcasm<br>  As for tax cuts... they should be getting them because straight couples get them.  What part of "equality" do you not understand?  Are you just mathematically challenged or something?  Gay or straight people should have the right to get married for tax cuts if they want to.<br>  <br>  "Besides, how many gay people do you know, who are willing to wait until marriage?"  Despite the fact that this argument has NOTHING to do with the topic, psychological   studies have been done, dummy.  Gay people have no more or less libido than straight people.  The vast majority of straight people don't wait until marriage.  By your argument, straight marriage should be illegal.  You firmly believe that 2+2=5, don't you?  And by the way, I'm bi and I was a virgin till I was 26 because I wanted to wait for love.  Guess that blows your sex fiend argument out of the water, doesn't it?<br>  <br>  I feel sooooo sorry for your sibling.  If you loved that person, you would not vote to oppress them  Your "logic" makes it clear that you have no good argument.  You just make up stupid house of card talking points to justify your hate and your desire to control the lives of others.  You are rotgut.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Let the rain of thumbs commence.<br>  <br>  I have no problems with Gay people writing out legal contracts which state they can share each others stuff.  That's called a will, and anyone can designate who they want to inherit their worldly belongings.  They can even legally sign over power of medical attorney to anyone they want as well.  Gay people already can exercise these legal abilities, so why do they also need "religious" recognition of their commitment together when the Christian faith pretty broadly repudiates homosexual activities.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for the homosexual community, the US Constitution does allow religions to be free of State interference in religious matters.  However, the US Constitution is silent on matters of sexual identity.  The US Constitution is also silent on the concept of marriage as that is also deemed to be within the realm of religion.  <br>  <br>  The laws relating to marriage primarily deal with property rights, and responsibilities for debts.  Once again these same property assignments can be made through contractual agreements which will be recognized in a court of law.  <br>  <br>  Why the need for marriage then?<br>  <br>  There is one reason I can think of so far.  So they can get the State and Federal benefits and tax breaks.  Homosexuals want to be able to tap into the socialistic pork that is already rampant in our government.  They want to drain from the welfare teat like the rest of society, and who cares if the country goes down with them.  Like the rest of the greedy and selfish people they want theirs too, and screw those of us who end up paying for it all.<br>  <br>  That's my personal objection to homosexuals being married.

There are also non romantic reasons why 2 people want to form such a partnership from time to time.  The partnerships would have the sort of rights and responsibilities currently assigned to couples considered "married".  Couples who cohabit without benefit of such a partnership would just be considered roomies under the law.  The various religions could define for themselves what constitutes marriage, and enforce their standards within the religion but not affect everybody else. They could have their own rituals of sanctification of the union, and call that marriage according to their own standards. I don't think religious standards should be applied as law to people who don't even belong to that religion.|`|7mMwphbbaa	they can do wut they want to doo|`|dmlxljgeaa	it is a human right afforded to us in the US by our constitution|`|APseoAl6aa	I don't understand the religious concept of Marriage, I just see it as a Legal status which entitles couples to certain rights.

Sin entered and the entire world was tainted with it. God showed the world what He thought of Gay people when He destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. They aren't just written about in the Bible but in other writings you can see where the entire world knew why they were destroyed. Why agree with something that by nature you know isn't right?  Most people are ignorant and just follow their feelings and the world has taught you "Just do it". So you follow with your noses pierced with the cords of this world and it leads you around like it owns you and it does, and most don't have a clue as to why Jesus Had to Die for your salvation or what your salvation is all about.   <br>  So as you see Christians or any other religion with all due respect choosing not to go against what is by nature healthy and want to promote in our schools and churches and everywhere what is like a cancer that only will destroy us.<br>  I can only pray for those that choose to go against what God has set up and I do read the bible and we know that Christ said that it will be like it was in the days of Sodom And Gomorrah when He returns so as it is written so shall it be done.<br>  14% of the population is Gay and they recruit daily to strengthen their numbers so each one has the right to choose Christ and His Kingdom or Satan and His.

My partner and I decided to portray the characters who appeared in the dialogues at the beginning of each chapter of the text. That way, there was already a storyline for us, and we were even able to import phrases from the dialogues into our conversation.

Many organizations, made up mostly of white folks, have scholarships. Ever notice how many of the recipients are black?<br>  <br>  Not many.<br>  <br>  Every time a person goes to interview for a job, they are being judged on the basis of their color as well as ability, and don't you think they aren't!!!<br>  <br>  Do you think it is so hard for a person to be biased in their hiring practices?<br>  <br>  Well, consider this: You obviously think there's a kind of unfairness going on. That suggests to me that you might be thinking, "Hey, wait a minute! Why is the deck stacked against the whites?" That is a perfectly logical question.<br>  <br>  Now, picture yourself as an interviewer for a company. You have every intention of being totally fair, but in the back of your mind, there's this concern about the stacked deck. Inevitably, you will allow that to influence your thinking in evaluating applicants. A white guy comes in and is just a tiny bit curt or rude, and you let it slide. A black person does the same thing, and BAM! their resume is in the shredder.<br>  <br>  There's incredible bias TODAY against black folks.<br>  <br>  I used to teach in prison. Walking down a corridor in prison, it was hard not to notice that almost all the prisoners seemed to be black. And almost all of the guards (they say they HATE being called guards) are white.<br>  <br>  Does this mean the crimes are being done most by blacks?  No, not even close, if you believe the statistics the criminal justice system itself puts out. It is just that when a black person hits the criminal justice system, he's probably going to jail, whereas when a white person is arrested, he's probably getting probation or even acquittal.<br>  <br>  This is not opinion; this is the reality of the world we live in. You can, if you so desire, check it out, and you'll find that it's even worse than I'm making it appear.<br>  <br>  Blacks constantly are getting tickets for silly-@ss violations. A friend of mine was a master's degree social worker, who had been the executive director of the local family assistance agency for some time. He was a person of sterling character. He was also from the islands, and you would call him black. A cop pulled him over for "using his turn signal too early."<br>  <br>  The blacks have a term for this kind of constant harassment by the police: they call it DWB -- "Driving While Black."<br>  <br>  You have a whole array of incredible advantages over blacks that are so insidious and so pervasive that you take them for granted and don't even notice them. <br>  <br>  The United Ne.gro College Fund is set up to assist schools that offer college education to black students. It exists because someone chose to organize it, and others like me chose to contribute to it over the years. It is a fundamental right to do that if we wish to.<br>  <br>  There are in fact lots of funds that offer scholarships that favor whites. A concept of fairness has discouraged these, but they certainly are still around. <br>  <br>  Lots of scholarships are for people of certain ancestry, such as German or Swedish ancestry. When churches give a scholarship, if it's a white church, you can assume the scholarship is going to a white student. <br>  <br>  Now, take a good look at schools that are supported by the UNCF. You can find out their endowment really easily. Then compare them to schools that historically only admitted whites, such as Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.<br>  <br>  It is true that these schools today are admitting blacks, but this is extremely recent. <br>  <br>  Slavery did not exist after the end of the Civil War, right?<br>  <br>  Wrong. Sharecroppers are black farmers who are strapped with enough debt that they never are able to buy their way out, so they are trapped in a never-ending cycle. This has been helped in the past few decades, but there sure ARE lots of black people alive today who can tell you about their experiences with sharecropping.<br>  <br>  In the early twentieth century, blacks in the south were typically arrested for some reason -- often a trumped up charge -- and then, as part of their sentence, forced to work for someone for a prescribed time.|`|uxfacsgmaa	I think racism of any kind is unfortunate and ignorant, but at the same time, I would never presume to understand what it's like to be a minority in America (being a white Canadian might have something to do with that, but hey). On one hand I can understand where a lot of that anger comes from, but on the other hand, more anger doesn't solve any problems. <br>  <br>  So yeah. I guess I can't really give a good answer...I'm not too sure what my feelings are on this matter.

Look, according to statistics, many African Americans don't even take advantage of that kind of college fund because much of them, not all, look up to the African Americans who are already successful, and sadly to say, they look up to the ones who have out Rap albums talking about killing cops and smoking weed. So they follow suit thinking they'll make a big record label and get lots of money. There are those who do take advantage of it though and do become highly successful. Nothing wrong with that. As far as the whole blacks saying what they want about white people and white people can't say anything, well I have to side with Chris Rock on this one...<br>  <br>  "The people with the most ****, get to say the least ****. And the people with the least ****, get to say the most ****. So if you want to say more ****, then give up some of your ****!"<br>  <br>  And I really don't see a reason to be racist. I am convinced there is a clear distinction between a black person and a ******. A black person is out there working hard, providing for his family with what ever money he can get. Constantly on the struggle to give to his family. A ****** however takes advantage of you, possibly mugs you and steals your stuff. That's a ******. Smoking weed is not a deciding factor, successful people, white and black smoke a blunt at home when they get home from work, they don't let it control their life.<br>  <br>  And your right about your son, it's not fair, but that's the way it works unfortunately, it's a law that was passed, employers are required, if both people have the same qualifications and work experience, they have to go with the black person. If the black guy is under qualified, your son will get the job, don't worry about that.|`|v1zyfea5aa	It is my unfortunate experience that the least racist of all Americans today are the "white" people.  Just look at the election.  95-98% of the AA will vote for Obama, not because of his policies, but because he is black.  (and his family weren't slaves-in fact,it is likely that his Arab ancestors were slavers, because that was why most of them were in East Africa- to enslave non-moslems.)  Also, Howard Stern had an interesting interview of Harlem blacks.<br>  <br>  Finally, the racial hatred poured out by African Americans is such that Whites are raped, robbed and murdered everyday, but no one calls it a hate crime.  It is just considered a crime.  Google the murders in Memphis, Atlanta, Knoxville, New Orleans etc. and see the hate for what it is.  The one in Knoxville, is particularly disgusting because a couple was brutally raped, mutilated and murdered, and all the police can come up with is car-jacking.  You don't see rioting for the lack of justice in this case.<br>  <br>  Until, we begin to make all races American again, we will not eliminate the Hate exhibited against the Whites.  And AA will NEVER come into the American Dream (regardless of whom they steal the presidency for) until we begin to accept AA are the problem and stop asking for what they don't work for, stealing what isn't theirs, and hating people of other colors instead of accepting the salvation and teachings of Jesus.  Sorry if I sound bitter.  I'm just tired of the stereotyping.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	It is something many Americans simply can't get over.<br>  <br>  The fact is every race has been enslaved at some point in history.  For another fact, when nationalities come to America, they all have been downgraded and stomped on.  This supports the Arrogance of Americans needing someone to look down on--to feel superior to.<br>  <br>  The English looked down on the Indians, who saved their lives after the English got here and starved.  Followed by the French, German, Irish, etc. to the actual African slaves.  All of these have had turns as the lowest form of life.<br>  <br>  The plan was if Lincoln had lived, may or may not have been done.  But a plan was for the slaves to be gradually freed.  First getting some education and not being turned loose cold into the culture.  If this had been done perhaps we would not have the inequity that now exists.<br>  <br>  Never the less, today middle eastern people are the newest to be looked down on.  Blacks and Hispanics now join in looking down on them.|`|AA10877643	Their is a silent oppression active in the world of social engineering and which contributes to division of people and not unity. A good name or a good cause will be given as a "Logo' for this supposedly "good" work. I think that there is a political background to it, masked by the veneer of 'goodness', 'justice' etc. White Christian people, need to read the:" signs of the times"( Pope Pius X11, 1945). The imposition on groups to feel ashamed and to apologize to all and sundry successfully helps us keep quiet, not complain, nor speak out--but it is a SYSTEM which works, whilst the political incentive develops.|`|r3sg5Xsdaa	A lot of black people are prejudice against whites and raise their kids to fear or be weary of them.

It is a shame that some young white people are ashamed of being white because of something that happened when they were not born.

So for instance there can't really be a "Kenyan American Day" or a "Siera Leone Day" or a "Senegal Amercian Day".  <br>  <br>  So they have their Black American stuff instead, as a general category.<br>  <br>  Makes sense to me.|`|DqtSdgtPaa	I am not sure why it is allowed.

There are many feminists that are more for women than for equality. The original intention for most of the women rights pioneers was equal rights, not more rights than anyone else.<br>  <br>  The same could be said with unions. In my city in 1919 there was a city wide strike. This brought about unions and many changes to working conditions. Now at the time, the changes were meant to bring more fairness and equality to the worker. However, unions today seem to be more about screwing the employer and protecting lazy employees. If the strikers of 1919 could see what the strikers of today are striking for, most would tell them to suck it up.|`|yX7fVGWLaa	NEWS FLASH: There are people still alive whose grandparents were slaves.

Pretty different, huh?<br>  <br>   It wasn't THAT long ago, and 400 years of horrific oppression can't be just "forgotten" because we don't have slaves anymore. Half the life of this country was spent in slavery. It helped to create an almost-permanent underclass of people who were abused and degraded for no other reason than their skin color.
