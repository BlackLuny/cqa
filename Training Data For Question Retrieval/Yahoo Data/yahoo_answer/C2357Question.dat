20090308092350AAAoGCq	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Do you think this is unfair? Honest opinions please..!?	Im in year 9, and the top science set are allowed to do the same GCSE's as the year 11's. Normally, I wouldnt care, but this means that whatever grade they get in Year 9, they can say "i'm happy with my A, so thats my year 11 grade" or than can say "i can get better with a C, so i'll retake it in year 10". However, the other sets in year 9 are only allowed to take it in year 11. So they get 3 chances to get a good Grade, where we only get one.
20090308092305AAPXvck	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Can you please tell me what you think of my nursing essay? It is just my rough draft.?	Nursing to me means a better future for my family. Starting a family at a young age as I did, there was little time for college or career goals. I was a very dedicated mother and chose to be there for my children during their early years. I know that there is nothing more important in the whole world. I am now at the point in my life when a career is very important to me.  I am now ready to dedicate myself to a career that I have a passion for. That career for me is nursing. I have wanted to be a nurse from a very young age.  Every nurse that I have known or come into contact with has inspired me with their knowledge and expertise. A nurse’s ability to care for a patient’s complex medical needs and still be a caring and helpful support to the patient and their entire family fascinates me.     I am very dedicated to my goal of becoming a nurse. I have worked very hard to make it to this point in my education. I have strived to be the best that I can be. Having earned a 4.0 GPA at Davenport and being among the top students in most of my classes I believe that I have proven to myself and to Davenport that I have what it takes to succeed in this career. While taking classes at Davenport I have also prepared myself for this career by volunteering as a friendly visitor at Season’s Adult Day Care. I have gained experience talking to elderly people with diseases such as Alzheimer’s and dementia. I helped participants at Season’s with meaningful activities, games, and exercises. I have made many friends at Season’s and have gained a lot of respect and admiration for the elderly.  I have always been very interested in health and wellness. I try to practice healthy living practices every day such as proper nutrition and regular exercise. I believe it is important as a nurse to be a role model for good health. As a nurse I will be an advocate for a healthy lifestyle. Educating patients and their families about health and wellness will be very exciting for me.     Presently, my goal is to become a registered nurse.  I am interested in working in geriatrics or in rehabilitation. In the future I plan on getting a bachelor degree in nursing and possibly working in health education. I know I have the determination and drive to be successful. I will do whatever it takes to accomplish my goals. I have no doubts that if accepted into the nursing program that I will strive to be the top of my class. I am very excited to begin the clinical phase of my education and start building the skills I will use in my career as a nurse.

20090308093833AAOlQ5n	Education & Reference;Teaching	A question for High School Science Teachers?	I have noticed many people have a misconception about heat transfer.      "Which freezes faster, hot water or cold water?"      Most people that I ask this to say that the hot water freezes faster. How can it be that so many people are misinformed? When I ask where they got such a crazy idea, they always say the same thing. "From my high school science teacher".  (I just asked the question here on yahoo and got a 90% hot water answer)      How can we spread the truth to the average science teacher?  Do you all have a newsletter or something?      It makes me cringe when I think about the wasted electricity as millions of people fill ice trays with HOT water and put them in the freezer.      (Please don't quote the Mpemba thing. What that says is that it is possible, that you might get cold water to freeze faster occasionally, not that it is the rule, that it is an exception. And in it the "theory" states that external factors may be responsible, duh. Like putting one sample closer to the freezer vent.)      Please help save energy, teachers.

I don't mind years of studying and blood and hard work and competitiveness (if that's a word!) but today, thinking about it i'm not so sure. I'm not supposed to choose my options until i'm in year nine, and there's another school in which I could easily (and previously have) been accepted into. Should i tell my mum i don't want to choose my GCSE's now (because what i study affects what i become in the future) and that i want to go to another school or should i just leave it and hope it passes?   i really need an opinion   thanks   luvsxxx   ElectroRaveGirl

20090308104430AA2ZkTu	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Could I get into Tisch School Of The Arts?	I've been living in Sweden since I was 10 and I'm in my second year of high school here. I am an American citizen. I have been thinking about going to college in the USA, preferably in New York. I'm most interested in Tisch undergraduate drama department. The problem is that I don't know what I have to do in order to get in. The Swedish grade system is different from the American one, but I tried to convert it and I think my GPA is somewhere around 3.65. Is that enough? Money is not really a dilemma yet, but I was hoping on getting some financial aid. I haven't taken any acting classes since I was younger, but being an actress has always appealed to me and I'm going to enroll in an acting group in the fall. I was also planning on moving to New York for a year and working there before going to school again, and was planning on taking acting classes while I'm there as well. I realize that one should be passionate about acting in order to get in, but I'm not sure I am passionate about it yet since I haven't taken any serious acting classes. So I’m not completely sure that this is the school for me yet, I’m just interested.       So the question is if you think I have a chance at getting in, and if you have any tips of things I can do to increase my chances?

I do worse on them.  I don't get why so many people like them.  I especially hate multiple choice questions that have choices such as "a) or b), all of the above, two of the above is false, etc.".  The benefit of short written questions is that you can be creative and express your ideas to your professor; whereas, you do not have the opportunity to do those things in multiple choice questions.

20090306230703AAXXugZ	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	I have a question about multiple choice questions.?	Let's say you write a multiple choice exam, and you pick "a" as your answer 4 times in a row.  Does that usually mean "a" is not the answer, and that one of the choices should be an answer other than an "a"?        In your experience of writing multiple choice questions on exams, if you use one of the answer choices (i.e "a", "b", "c", "d", etc.) more frequently than the other choices, does that mean you made an error?      Do professors generally "balance" or "equalize" the answer choices on a multiple choice exam?

I took the test seperately from the other students because of special accomodations.  I took it on one campus while the other students on another branch of the campus so the other students were able to take the test using a software and automatically got their grades.  I had mine done on paper so the teacher had to grade it by hand.  So it's not like she has millions of tests to grade.  It has been two whole weeks and she has not given me my test back yet.  She told me she got the test and she'd grade it and told me what day she'd have it done.  She didn't.  I emailed her again later that week after seeing nothing on my online progress report.  She only apologized for the delay and said she'd take care of it today (that was yesterday) and nothing on my progress report yet.  I don't know what's going on and why she's not telling me what my score is after 14 whole days of waiting.  She doesn't even tell me what's taking so long.  She keeps saying she'll give it to me but she never does.  What do I do?  Do I tell the head of the department?  I don't like to tell on her but I feel like I might have to.

20090307003504AAE1wc3	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	What do you think of my essay?How can I improve it?	Rock Music. What do you think of when you hear those words? Do you think of Jimi Hendrix’s guitar riffs, or The Who’s Keith Moon and his drum solos, maybe The Doors Jim Morrison and his undeniable stage presence? Or do you think of the horrible mainstream modern bands of today ,or that music is no longer taken as an art form but as a business, and how media distorts musical tastes. I believe that the supposed ‘death of rock’ in the 2000’s need to be resurrected with quality rock artists becoming popular again.    Many people I talk with would agree- they would much prefer to listen to older rock bands than todays’ lineup. Most popular modern rock bands formed within the 2000’s are horrible. I think the one main problem with it is the bands are too commercial. there are really only two types of “rock” that you really hear today; If you look at Wikipedia, pop rock in the definition it states many believe is a “commercial product” and “not a sincere form of music”. Also, Wikipedia states the emo type as becoming “mainstream”. If you turn on any musical television station you will at least hear one song from both. According to the Billboard Top 100, some of these artists are Fall Out Boy, The Academy Is….,Panic! At the disco, Boys Like Girls, Metro Station, Kelly Clarkson, and The Jonas Brothers (Honestly, you can’t get anymore commercial than the over-exposed Jonas Brothers who shouldn’t even be considered in the genre.). Rock Music used to be about not conforming and rebelling- not the opposite as it is today. Another problem with the modern rock genre is that  the songs are all too familiar. For this essay I thought I was being a bit too rough on the modern music genre, so I go to the billboard top 100 and look up the songs on youtube, after I was down listening to the popular songs I found that many of them were presumed undistinguishable from the others. Many had familiar tunes and vocal styles. My last problem with modern rock music is too distorted, mainly using electronic equipment such as a vocal effect processor. According to James Meeker, who wrote an article called ‘Improving your industrial vocals’ on a community for musicians called DarkSonus.com; He made a very good point, he states: “I'm getting a little tired of endless numbers of industrial artists running their vocals through distortion in order to sound "aggressive." Not only is this trend becoming tiresome, it ruins the dynamic range and depth of your vocal line.” and he also makes a point about people generally liking the human vocal range. This is generally an annoying habit that is overdone by bands particularly from the modern emo and metal/hard rock bands.    My next reason why we need quality rock artists to become popular again is because modern rock today is not taken as an art form but its thought of as a business.  Music is supposed to be an art form, a form of expression with even the most random of emotion. In the past, when you heard rock music you knew there was emotion behind it- just listen to Janis Joplin or Hendrix. Now in days it seems songs are limited to two emotions- love and hate. There is no meaning behind it or complexity and creativity, you can sense this when they are performing, artists like Pete Townshend of The Who captured whatever emotion the song was about and expressed it freely- you don’t really see that anymore, artists aren’t  feeling their music.  I think a quote from the movie Almost Famous says how it was the best: “some people have a hard time explaining rock 'n' roll. I don't think anyone can really explain rock 'n' roll. Except Pete Townshend, but that's okay. Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle and a way of thinking... and it's not about money and popularity.”; Now it is mainly about money and popularity, Bands are even asking for extremely large sums to just play some venues. I think we need more bands in the public eye that are just in it for the music and expression.     Lastly, I think we need more quality rock artists around because the media distorts the masses musical tastes. Lets Face it, the media has a major influence over us; Would people care more about world issues  and less about celebrities if magazines didn’t try to dramatize their ‘glamorous’ lives. The media controls basically all trends, including music. Mostly all media(Except really Rolling Stone) picks some mediocre band and over-exposes them until every just had to have them on their play lists. The media basically can generate a lot of hype over a band , and maybe if they can get hold of maybe a more underground or lesser known quality rock band it would generate a following. Now, I am one of the many rock advocates constantly looking for newer material and bands to listen to. I must admit its pretty hard when it comes to newer rock music- you have to look for it sometimes due to lack of media coverage. I’m not as bias to modern rock is it may seem, I mean I do have some particular newer songs and bands I listen to and some are even

20090227103328AAGhNkj	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	How can I work faster during a GCSE exam?	I've got GCSE science exams coming up on wednesday. They're multiple choice, so I don't have to be doing any writing, just filling in dots on a seperate piece of paper. I still, however, have to read through a questions booklet. These usually have diagrams and information before asking you a question on that subject. I have 30 minutes per paper and and am taking 5 tests.      How can I help to work faster? I find it hard to take in so much information, process it and answer it reliably in such a short time. It's 60 marks, so I'm working at a 1 mark every half a minute. I've been trained into checking and re-checking my answers through, and I've now become very paranoid. I also accationally find that my mind goes blank, only reading the words and not the questions, and I have to read it through several times, before It makes sense. Top all that with the pressure of the exam and you've got a cocktail for trouble.      I'm in set 1 science and extremely enthusiastic about the subject. I'm also an accomplished reader. I've never failed a science exam at school, and while I'm sure I will get atleast a C, I feel that I'm losing out on B's, A's and A*'s because I can't finish the paper.      Advice would be great! Thanks.

I am planning on graduating right after junior year, because I feel like I have gotten all I could of gotten from high school. I don't want to move too fast, and don't want people thinking I'm trying to get out of there because I hate high school or something, but I feel like I'm ready to explore my options. This has nothing to do with friends, I have plenty of them, it is a purely academic and future career choice.      I like to have options to explore the opportunities I could have.   I'm interested in many different things, and I might want to do something in the film industry. What should I do for the year? Should I take a gap year, take a job and take part time classes in a community college? Should I apply for university early, take an internship? How could I approach this situation. I just need some advice and the opinions of other people.   I have, already though, decided that I will graduate after junior year, so I don't want people telling me to stay for senior year.      And once again, it has nothing to do with school and me not liking high school. I talked to my school counselor, who helps out students with classes, credits, and guidance, and she thought maybe I didn't have many friends, but trust me, that is not the issue. I'm the happiest I have been with my social situation.

It aggravates me because I honestly want to learn and I take pride in my school work.      Lately, however, I've been noticing that a lot of my male teachers pay more attention to the super pretty, "popular" girls.

I was just wondering if anyone noticed any special preference of sex from a teacher.  In your experience, did you find any teachers you've ever had behaving the same way?

20070521075537AAzyJIV	Education & Reference;Other - Education	?Podéis ayudarme a corregir este texto en inglés?	Gracias!!      A day in Gibraltar   Last month, we were to Gibraltar. We were by bus, and it was very funny.    At the bordier, the gibraltarian policeman got on the bus and asked us for the documentation. When we arrived at Gibraltar we went to Main Street. And then we were to the cementery. It was very suprising for us because it was different from here.    Then we rode on a mini-bus and we went to the Rock of Gibraltar. There, we saw the famous monkeys. We loved them, because they seemed very friendly animals. Then, we went into the Caves and saw the theatre in there. When we left the Caves, we could buy souvenirs.    Then, we return to Main Street and we had a lot of free time, so we went to the supermarket to buy chocolate. In Gibraltar there are lots of differents kinds of chocolate. We bought a lot of it!   When we finished we return to the mini-bus and we went to Málaga.    It was a very enjoyable tip!
