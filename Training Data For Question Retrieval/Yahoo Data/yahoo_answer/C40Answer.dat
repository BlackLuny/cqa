uh2bkRrFaa	No, do NOT hire a lawyer like the buffoon is guessing.    Traffic school is to take off points. If you haven't been to traffic school you can go. You still pay the ticket and have to pay to go to school and pay for the school but your insurance then will not see the point. The court wants you to to go to traffic school becuase they make money off it besides the fine for your ticket. It's pretty easy.|`|vFvI16P7aa	You can hire a lawyer who can help reduce your ticket to a non-moving violation which would result in no points.  Also, you can ask if you qualify for traffic school (if this is your first ticket).  Once you pay your ticket and complete traffic school there are no points.  In my state, traffic school is usually one Saturday (time varies depending on the instructor).  It will not raise your insurance if you have no points on your license.  Insurance companies usually review your license history 1 time each year.    To Rock:  "Buffoon"?  And so we resort to name-calling.    Traffic school doesn't fix everything.  Some tickets are not eligible for traffic school (in my state), maybe you would know that if you weren't lost in your own world.  Hiring a lawyer is another recourse (some people don't want to "waste" their time going to traffic school) so you wouldn't get points on your license for the ticket.
VZnCXMxYaa	There is no liability in other countries with a drinking age (except Canada) that is right, most Americans obviously have no idea about the world outside America like the two answerers above me.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	Oddly I think this question would have mattered to me when I was 20.

xreWOKBYaa	Okay the answer above me is very unnecessary. My father, Fiance and myself are all police officers.    Depending on what your criminal record is, your education, and references you might still have a shot at passing the background check. (But there are a lot of other tests too! including physcial tests)    Go ahead and submit your application, maybe apply to be a police cadet first then move up.|`|yYImFx3Taa	if your looking to turn over a new leaf then yea it is possible. one of my friends has had plenty of cop trouble and is still going. It really just takes a great education. a bit of body building and devotion. I would consider taking up some criminal justice courses and some psychology. Your going to need a few years to learn more so i would suggest going to a community college first and try out the courses at a cheap price so that you can be sure it's what you want to do with your life. make criminal justice your major and study it for about two years. if your college is like mine, you might get free entrance into the school gym. i would suggest buffing up there. its always good to be a healthy cop. if you need more information on the courses, then feel free to email me at kpaiva19@yahoo.com|`|afikdpZoaa	Depends on the kind of trouble you have had, and if you have stayed out of trouble for a reasonable time.
ABdZDjjcaa	Because a bunch of people here put the illegals at the same level as timothy McVeigh, Charles Manson, or ted bundy    By the way, were those guys illegals ?    In the USA there are more than 35 million laws. That means that everybody here has violated some law at some moment    Besides, in the XIX century, according to the law, you could buy and sell human beings. Therefore, you support slavery|`|280a2e214bf05397a5b94e4faa4b6d61aa	The U.S. was not founded on the concept of a divine right, or monarch or even a common culture...the United States is entirely a product of the Law.

That makes it American.|`|pHmKGLMoaa	Because all of those illegal immigrants said to hell with American laws.  Their outlook is "to hell with American laws, I'm gonna get paid".  If you can't figure it out, you should leave with them.|`|44AkhdRnaa	It's just morally unjust to support criminals.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	Illegal means unlawful. If it was beneficial and the right way to live, it would not be called that. Is it a good trait to support someone that breaks the law? I have no problem with illegals personally because they did nothing against me but let's not say this is something that should be supported...it will encourage more people to emigrate illegally.|`|sIvUjRT3aa	Because it goes against the American way of following the rule of law.  Furthermore it is very detrimental to the US to continue to allow millions of low-skill anduneducated(to a modest standard) immigrants that will effectively be a net drain on the social and economic infrastructure.      In other words, would you be willing to grant amnest to drug dealers, bank robbers, and other criminals if the only reason they broke the law was for "a better life".  Unless you are planning to look the other way when a thief steals your wallet, then you can't support some law breakers and not others, least you be considered a hypocrite.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Do you support ALL illegal aliens? Or a select few? If it's all I would say it's unamerican to support terrorists wouldn't you? If it's a select few that's racist. So you're either a terrorist lover or a racist. No in between honey.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Why is it NOT un-American to support crime?   350,000 cases of child molestation every year by illegal aliens!

Supporting the injuring of people in the US is un-American.  The list goes on!   Keep the low life scum out of the US and you make the US safer for our children! Now that's American!|`|oKU7tFWyaa	Legals or illegals, I don't support drug users, alcoholics, bank robbers, auto thieves, burglars, identity thefts, check forgers, uninsured auto drivers, unlicensed drivers, or con artists by any means.  Yet, I some how have to support their expenses via my tax dollars for their treatment, jail services, higher auto insurance, higher health insurance, higher bank fees, educational/training programs, etc...  Is it un American for me to deny these people and not others?  Not at all.    IMHO - Supporting illegal immigration, and amnesty is like saying "Piss on this countrys laws, and the right way to go about doing things." If we wanted a lawless country, we would have stayed that way from 500 or more years ago.|`|4c21e2f4c011e6cd394d8baf6024f878aa	Because most Americans actually care about things that are called laws!

7CWwd8H2aa	I would suspect you can expect a visit from an agent of the Treasury Department, so you may want to be thinking hard where you may have received that bill, because the agent will want to know.    The person who gave you the counterfeit still owes you $100.|`|fEBOzWeXaa	I would pass this "buck" onto whoever you got this from.  since people don't usually get $100 as change, you will probably remember where you got it from.  Let them take the heat.

6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Generally, any history of asthma after the age of 13 will disqualify you.  I've NEVER heard of an asthma waiver but I've seen people here claim that it exists.    The waiver you would get, if there is one, would have to come from the military physicians at MEPS, not your personal physician.  In my experience the MEPS doctors will ignore anything and everything from your personal physician.  They make their decisions based on what they find in their diagnosis.    If the asthma is going to turn up it will be at basic training during PT.  I think that if you make it past there you'll be fine.|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	the sea air will clear up your asthma I used to have it bad too, but out at sea it disappeared|`|7n523JW1aa	You'll need to get your doctors consent and you will also be tested before you go into BCT. It is possible to get a waiver for this. My brother did but he is currently Deutsch Aviation Corps.|`|BKTx9IsZaa	Arg you'll walk the plank.|`|AQBi862Jaa	That is a hard one. I know that when I was in the army back in 2001-2002, there was a girl soldier that had asthma really bad. So bad that she could not even join us during pt time. She could not even go to the gas chamber to qualify each year due to the dangers she would put herself in. She eventually got an honorable discharge due to her asthma but I can not remember if she got it while in the army or not. If you come into the service with asthma and there is a problem while you are in training, then there may be some sort of waiver that you can sign but the military will not be at fault and you can not get any medical benefits if you get out due to your asthma. You can probably seek some VA benefits but not good enough to help you out with your condition.     I had a friend that had expected the military to help him out when he got out due to his asthma problem and they did not want to help him since he knew he had it when he first joined...such as like what you want to do. I dont know if any other service treats their servicemembers better but if so that is cool. Maybe going out to see does help. Id speak to a recruiter first, though...in each of the branches of military. Good luck.|`|0IYqBZewaa	i dnt knw|`|8q4RhpZWaa	If it's genetic you are screwed but if it isn't you can overcome it!

AA11494150	Many patrol cars have cameras, you should contact the department. If there is a video, you can request it through Open Records law.     However, running a yellow light is probably illegal also. so you may not have a defense. Many people confuse a flashing yellow with a solid yellow, they are not the same. Flashing means slow down, proceed with caution. Solid means stop, unless you are too close to do so safely.|`|uh2bkRrFaa	It wasn't yellow, it was red. At anytime you're in the crosswalk and it turns red, it's running a red light. If it was yellow when you crossed, it turned red. Yellow means slow down prepare to stop, not speed up and get the heck out. You try that excuse in court, the judge will literally laugh out loud.    You have NO case. Pay the ticket and go to traffic school, it won't be on your record. But if you fight it which it sounds llike you're going to no matter what I or anyuone else says, you will lose and you cannot go to traffic school then.     And the idiot claiming cops don't show up to court is of course GUESSING. Cops show up, they get paid overtime and if they don't show up, they now just reschedule the court date so don't fall for that old wives tail.|`|AA10465540	It is not an easy call.

This means that ALL of your vehicle be out of the intersection, this includes the rear bumper, before the light turns red.|`|XByFpkrwaa	I would still suggest you go and try and argue your case.    In my experience - most police officers usually are too busy to appear in court to argue their side (especially in a case like this).  If they don't show up to argue - you automatically win and the ticket is thrown out.    If they do show up, you still have a good chance of winning if you present your case well and have a good driving record.|`|AA11972842	It's not that easy, it depends on your court and how they evidence from the Police log is presented.

wyAtVqbOaa	First of all check your tenant agreement with House A as it may have been transferred to House B.      If it has been transferred, which it can be, then you have to give the required notice period, normally 30 days.  If it has been transferred and nobody has signed the new contract, then the new housemate is actually living there with no contract in place between either you and the other housemates or with the landlady.      If the contract is not transferable, then you all are living there with no contract.  You will be better of giving your notice but if you feel that you will not get your deposit back, then don't pay the last month and when your landlady asks for it, state that you are leaving at the end of the month and you are using your deposit for that month's rent.  There's nothing he can do about that - she can't change the locks or kick you out - the only people who can change locks or remove you from the building is the bailiffs on behalf of the court but you will be out before it goes through the courts.    As for telling her the truth I would.  She is open for prosecution under the Health and Safety Act for the number of people living there as well as if they are injured and they are classed as living there, then this changes her insurance etc.      Good luck.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Sounds a horrible position to be in. My sympathy. These situations often break down rapidly making life unbearable.    From the details you supply:  1 I would have expected the lease document you signed initially for house A would include the address of the property being leased.    Therefore if you now reside in House B the details appertaining to A cannot apply to you in B.  The Lease for B has not been signed and so there is no contractual obligation on your part.    Resolution. Depending on the relationship you have with the landlord you could perhaps resume you original tenure of House A (transferring your portion of the deposit back and paying your original rent.)  If you have to share again to make up the rent shortfall be selective about your co-renter and agree some common courtesies before starting..    If it were me paying in excess of 600 PCM the very least I would expect is some peace of mind.  Where are you -Central London??   2. Cut your losses (by all means approach your landlord and request your portion of the deposit be returned) - See what the response is.   But if you can afford that sum I would be out of there like a shot - your co sharers obviously have no consideration for you so dont feel guilty - Go!    Best Wishes & Good Luck.|`|dGM6JGqdaa	Hey man they can't hold you to a lease that was never signed, what I would do is tell your roomates that your moving out if the bul-hit doesn't stop, no more sleep overs ect !

If so you are under a lease and can't leave without paying your share in full!  Doesn't matter what reason you give, you  may still be under the lease.  If it doesn't say that, you may be able to move.|`|fUhosu5Raa	Tell your landlord... the real reason you want to move out.. explain to them that your roomates have people sleeping over all the time there is a law that guests cant stay longer than a week... but as long as your landlord knows you are moving out hopefully you will get your deposit back!! good luck p.s. roomates never work out i have went threw 5 already|`|6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Generally, when there is no lease you need only give 30 days notice.  At least in the US.  You'd have to find out if your landlord transferred your lease to the new house, but that would be unusual.      I think it's rude on both parties to leave a guest in the house when you/they are not at home.  It's an enormous liability issue because you're essentially leaving a stranger in their home who might not abide by any house rules or standards.  It seems all parties failed to make clear the "yours, mine, and ours" of shared living.  You should be able to feel comfortable in your own home, but you also need to be cognizant that it is not yours alone and certain sacrifices must be made in those kinds of arrangements.      I think perhaps a non-confrontational meeting would help rectify things better than bailing, but if you're determined on that course, give the 30 days.  It's not necessary to explain why unless you're looking for sympathy and drama.|`|42910e399cf1ff7bf1eb16843000fb5eaa	There is no enforceable contract when there is not meeting of the minds. Give 30 days notice, but, you are still on a month to month contract or not. You need to look up your local landlord tenant laws and make sure you still have time this month to give notice.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	A month to month arrangement was assumed, so give him 30 days notice and move out.|`|CQXGO1M5aa	If you haven't signed a lease, you're under no obligation to give any notice before moving out. Just show up one day with a moving truck, and tell them goodbye!

He may have had an advantage in that the abortion was carried out, so there were technically losses. There is nothing he could legally do.

Either through advance directive or medical power of attorney or living will we can all have a choice in whether or not we want extreme measures taken to sustain our lives. Without these documents, all extreme measures WILL be taken. Thus, "euthanasia without a choice" could not occur. Now, if someone was killed when they didn't ask for suspension of extraordinary means, that would be murder -- a crime -- for which I would seek charging, conviction and punishment through the legal system.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	I'd think a fear mongering propaganda machine was at work on YA.|`|XRYAfxpTaa	Someone would be in deep trouble.

Such an act is murder.  We should care much more for each other.   The presumption must be that a person unable to communicate would chose life, and that prior statements and signed affidavits such as "I'd rather die than ..." must be ignored, because one's mind changes when one is actually in the extreme situation, and those who come through it, alive, say that regardless of our words previous, WE WANT TO LIVE, even in pain, even disabled.  Life is so valuable!

v6l3o2kvaa	I had the same issue actually, for those 3 months working ADSW (Active Duty Special Work) call up to HRO at your state headquarters and request a DD 214 for the time you worked.  Give them the copy or copies of your orders so they know the dates to fill in for the 214.  As soon as they give you that fax your 214 and copies of your LES for the time paid so unemployment will be able to determine how much you'll get.  Also if you were paid BAS and BAH that will factor in to your unemployment     Warning:  This will bite you in the @ss when tax season comes so watch out,    Hope this help|`|gDSJpRvTaa	You are eligable for "Unemployment Benifits"...  There is no such thing as "BAH" in the  Unemployment benifits...    End of Story...|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	It depends on your state. I pretty sure they will not add BAH on to it because Unemployment pays based on your earned salary.    If the State is out of money, where are they going to get "State Unemployment" benefits?    P.S. they will ask you if you worked (paid or not)?  Why did you stop working?|`|Rn9N7E0uaa	The National Guard in your state ran out of funds?  I'd like to hear more about this.

We have in fact had Presidents that fit this description in the past.  Do some research and you will see!|`|bxV80Clnaa	There have been 'brilliant intelligent' presidents before.

Yes, he speaks well and has made many promises but we will have to wait and see if this was all a Hollywood movie script or if he is really as good as he claims to be.|`|yQ0OzEbZaa	Obama embraces aspects of his blackness, which allows whites to see him as an authentic repository of their historical guilt from which he can absolve them.    I appreciate that it is really something to have our first black president, and some people are joyful about this historical event.    But even the great Martin Luther King Jr. would probably be turning over in his grave because people have failed to listen to his message.  He said a man should be judged by his character and not be the color of his skin. Obama has failed to show good character.|`|jzedZUhaaa	Do you get tingley sensations in your shorts now?

Obama has no real sense of Moral Patriotism ! He didn`t get it from Saul Alinsky in "Rules for Radicals"; which was his play book for his train of thought for his political agenda of "socialism" ! It wasn`t Rev Wright that put the pride of Moral Patriotism into Obama , it wasn`t Bill Ayers , it wasn`t the communist Franklin Davis , his early teen years mentor , it wasn`t Louis Farrakhan , he didn`t get Moral Patriotism from ACORN , nor did he become enlightened in the pride of Moral Patriotism by being a "community organizer" and blackmailing banks into giving unqualified home loans to unqualified borrowers !

He himself is not a committed muslim.  He really isn't a committed anything except his own ambition and some of the fascinating theories his inner college boy would like to try out as president.

Fact: Obama has been meeting with William Ayers for education reform, he is not planning terrorist acts. Had you checked your facts you would know That Ayers is a well known proffesor at the university of illinois, and is also known for his work in fundraising for educational purposes. Plus they're both from chicago before his presidency obama lived within a couple blocks of ayers of course theyre going to run into each other.

SlhuFfuZaa	In certain battles it is almost always good strategy to pit likes against likes. One wouldn't try to compare apples to cherries or olives, would you? The R.N.C. could go with a different minority, say Jindal or another woman, like they were thinking with Palin, but it is still better to stick with the status quo.  Now another way to go would be a black woman, and really clean house. They would get a large number of the female vote and a lot of the black vote. They may lose many of the anti feminist and male vote but I believe it would be worth a try.   Another way might be either an oriental woman/man and a black woman/man as team mates. Or, Latino and black, oriental or Native American, in any mixture.  The Native American idea sounds fine to me. But what ever we do, we must keep our liberties and freedom alive until the next election and get Congress cleaned out, VOTE, NO incumbents, unless they are Constitutionalists or against the Federal Reserve system.

If African-American students choose not to be around Caucasian or, Asian students, that is one thing.  But if the school were to intentionally keep them separated, for the purposes of creating a racial divide, that would be segregation.

Perhaps a dictionary might help you with terminology.  Or, maybe a call to your local IRS branch for the correct terminology would be better.  Since Dashcle was the one who contacted his own accountant about the matter I highly doubt any judge or prosecutor would be willing to bring him to trial on tax evasion charges.  It is good to question these men on this matter, but they are smart enough not to be tax evaders.    One can call them tax avoiders but Tax avoidance is the legal utilization of the tax regime to one's own advantage, in order to reduce the amount of tax that is payable by means that are within the law. Many people do this and not just the one's in D.C or Wall Street.  There are many means of doing it legally.  By contrast tax evasion is the general term for efforts to not pay taxes by illegal means.|`|0P9GYAx6aa	From Chicago, what did anyone expect.|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Cause to get elected he need to give sheep something to hate on and now they can do nothing about it.

Although at this point, I'm questioning all sides of the spectrum.   I don't think the Gov should have been pressured in any form, regardless if the replacement chosen, to be announced, Bonnie Newman, does not plan to re-run in 2010. It's the Gov's job to listen to the will of the people of their state, not the deal making of officials in Washington.   But the fact that Gregg made a deal at all period so that he would accept the position doesn't speak highly for upfront integrity.  I think he will probably do a good job as it would be in his best interest to do so.    Interesting fact though, Gregg voted to abolish the Commerce Dept in 1995. So one has to wonder about all sides at this point.  http://www.politicker.com/new-hampshire  http://www.politico.com/news/stories/020...  http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?...

As if that's such a novel idea...gee, talk to a recruiter about the military...who would have thought?    I remember talking to a recruiter a few years ago, just before my brother enlisted in the Air Force. I'm glad that I didn't enlist myself, because the stories my brother told me after serving were completely different than the idealistic picture the recruiter had painted for me.    Recruiters are no different from sales people. They say what they have to in order to reel in new recruits. That's not to say that serving in the military isn't a noble profession, it would just be nice if they were a little more upfront regarding certain aspects of it.|`|sfCnE2O4aa	Recruiter's and used car salesmen; One in the same.|`|xzSuXnvpaa	No. Recruiters have a job.

EDIT: In the national guard you are only covered by health care the weekends you serve and the two weeks you serve not the rest of the year like they promised( Marine Wife) also these lies really happened so why the thumbs down, you guys don't think the government lies to you?

And, his team's analysis of the problem and modeling of the solutions are ignored by the Congressional Republicans, who continue to play politics.<br>  <br>  When Obama can move onto issues that people can actually understand, we will have better examples of his presidential prowess - or weakness.<br>  <br>  I challenge Republicans to be specific about your criticisms of Obama - and, for heaven's sake, don't use the word "socialism," it has been so misused in relation to Obama that it doesn't have any meaning.|`|xtrdlyJHaa	Well, having just answered a question slamming Bush as the dumbest person in the world for hesitating several minutes after he learned of the second plane hitting the world trade centers, I would say it is pretty even.<br>  <br>  Here is the question:<br>  "On 9/11, when George Bush did nothing for 7 minutes after being told about the 2nd plane,?<br>  Do you think he was really "portraying an image of calm" (as he claims) or was he just completely clueless?"<br>  <br>  Couple that with people who consistently accuse him and Cheney of war crimes (of which they were not convicted or even charged)...well, you get my point.<br>  <br>  Add in the horrible McCain and Palin comments...enough said. <br>  <br>  Do you think those comments don't hurt US?|`|hcc8fq7jaa	Have you actually heard any of the horrible things that have been said by democrats about Bush in the last eight years, sweetie?

zLUQJxJkaa	LOL well I don't personally care for tats, but I did see one sick tat on a guy.. no picture but i'll try to describe it to you.. idk maybe it'll inspire you haha, He had on his left bicep, from the top of the shoulder to like 3 inches above the elbow:<br>  EGA, instead of a globe it was a circle with a sniper in a ghillie suit aiming out of it. The eagle was facing front (with a p*ssed off expression), one wing had the American flag, and the other had a "ghost" of a KBAR knife.<br>  Instead of rope around the anchor there was barbed wire. Under the anchor was "Scout Sniper"- and along the outside edge of the globe was "One shot one kill" "Death from afar" and a couple other sniper-type quotes.<br>  Now all of this was inside the "skin" that was being torn by another eagle from the outside. On the breast of the outside eagle was "9/11"- the "11" wasn't a number but it was the two towers making the number.<br>  I was sitting beside the guy for a half hour.. that's how I remember lol, plus he explained some of it just chatting with him.<br>  I wouldn't really suggest anything but whatever you want.|`|AA11586960	sorry there is no such thing as a GOOD tattoo idea|`|fSlZQzS4aa	A better idea is no tattoo at all.|`|4oOzm8L3aa	Umm its ok but theres a lot more better|`|ov5F2Fmnaa	its ok but theres a lot more better ones that u can choose from

The decision to go to war against the Salafi-Wahabi muslims in Afghanistan and Iraq and Somalia and Sudan and southern Philipines etc was ultimately his to sign off on, but apparently the massive effort in the Iraq battlefield is what pissed alot of people off, so i give you that one. <br>  The economy has very little to do with the guy in the oval office, however.  The US Congress controls the purse strings and where most of it gets spent or where taxes get cut, and the Fed 'controls' the money supply.  The Oval Office can provide leadership, but that is about it.  The USA recession of 2008-2009 was caused by the affordable housing laws and the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae institutions, all created by democrats, so no blame there for Bush, except that he did not make enough of a public stand or outcry against not regulating Fannie and Freddie, but neither did 99.9% of Americans. So be explicit what you blame him for, when answering this post's question.  Thanks.|`|AA11570618	Every administration gets blamed for things that happen on its 'watch'. That's why you saw a mediocre attempt on behalf of the Republicans to win this election. They KNOW how bad things really are going to get (in fact, Obama's probably discovering right now that things are TEN TIMES worse than the Bush administration admitted). The Bush administration KNEW about the worst economic depression about to hit this nation [I predict by October, 2009]. The Bush administration KNEW about the trillions of dollars in debt its insane, illegal, corrupt, unconstitutional, illegal 'war' has put American taxpayers in; the Bush administration 'cooked the books' so that the GOP will be able to blame the Democrats for what goes wrong in the next eight years. It took eight years for GWB to destroy this nation; it will take Obama & Co. much more than 8 years to fix it. <br>  In this instance, Bush IS to blame. He will go down as the WORST President in U.S. history [to date]. I've been blaming Bush since the first day he took office; I still blame him.

prqrQcd1aa	My opinion may be a bit biased since I actually knew Kenzie while i was living in New Castle about 8 years ago...<br>  <br>  The father will not be charged...but should be held partially responsible.. He has made threats and said things about not liking the fact that Kenzie and his father were together.. Sadly we are not required to keep guns locked up and away from kids in the state of PA, sucks yes..stupid, yes..we have to change these laws.<br>  <br>  Now..what makes an 11 year old tick? To the point where he is sooo jealous that he actually kills someone? I think that for the time being the child needs to go to an adolecent psych ward...not the freaking county jail that can't even house him.. <br>  <br>  He IS going to be charged as an adult, no matter how we feel about this, or what we say about this.. In the state of PA, if you are 10 years old and kill somone with premeditation, you ARE charged as an adult.<br>  <br>  He killed not only Kenzie, but also the baby that was inside of her...i say baby because had she have been found right after it had happend, the child would have had the chance to survive... he is being charged with killing this un born child as well. <br>  <br>  I think that there could be a chance that if he gets help that he would not kill again as an adult.. I think he should get say about 25 years in jail.. first in juvie, then send him to a regular jail once he turns 21... it's usually 21 in our state that you can't go to juivie anymore. <br>  <br>  This is how I feel about it.|`|c07v7O80aa	He may have to be charged as an adult in order not to be automatically released when he becomes an adult.

Understand that undertaking discovery of evidence against a large company is going to take time, a long time.  <br>  <br>  My advice is on future calls, turn the tables on them.  Record the calls from your end.  Even let them know you are recording.  Although in most states only one party needs to know.  You may be surprised how the tone and content of the call changes when the credit card company knows you are recording.  <br>  <br>  During a phone call, there is no real evidence retained.  It comes down to a "he said" -- "she said" situation.  If there is a recording of the conversation then there is no question what was said.  <br>  <br>  I wrote an article about this on eHow - link below.  It has some good information and a link to state laws.  I hope it is helpful to you.

If searched and the agent feels you should have a script they will seize it, that is usually all.<br>  The big thing is no diet pills of any kind, they are death on that but personnel use stuff and amounts is normally OK.<br>  If you need a pain reliever as strong as tram you should get a script, then there is no trouble bringing it back and it is cheaper than in the US if you do not have insurance.|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	It's very illegal. Customs won't be upset about it, they'll arrest both of you for narcotics trafficking. Maybe at some point during this discussion with your husband, you could google "Mexican Drugs" and see what's going on down there. It's not pretty.|`|aY9v3SJKaa	You can bring it back without a valid prescription but MUST declare it!! If you fail to declare it you are breaking the law and if caught are subject to arrest.<br>  <br>  A 1998 amendment allows a United States resident to import up to 50 dosage units of a controlled medication without a valid prescription at an international land border. These medications must be declared upon arrival, be for your own personal use and in their original container. However, travelers should be aware that drug products which are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration may not be acceptable for such importation. <br>  <br>  It is against the law not to properly declare imported medications to U.S. Customs. <br>  <br>  lt is important to have medications in the originally-dispensed container.
hcc8fq7jaa	How about it? They've been calling him stupid for over 8 years, yet at the same time claim he masterminded all these horrible deeds, PLUS lied to and fooled every member of congress, PLUS lied to and fooled the heads of state of our allies.

And the answer to your question is, he didn't mastermind anything, and that's why he was such a failure as a president. I've never met a single person who thinks that Bush blew up the levees. If he was a mastermind, he wouldn't be such a bad president. A mastermind would use the overwhelming support for the US after 9/11 to help capture those responsible for it. A mastermind would plan ahead. A mastermind would not sent troops in harms way to settle old scores. That's thinking with your gut, something a mastermind would never do.|`|JUk8Hih0aa	I agree with you completely but you know what I have noticed...no matter how hard people like you, myself, my husband and other people who know the truth try to inform the others it's not worth it. The only thing they will do is question us back instead of offering hard facts *because there are not any*, and so what we should be doing is instead of questioning them back...prove them wrong. Inform them of the bills the senate is passing and inform them of all the crap Obama is doing now and how wrong it is. In the end they will either see the truth which is what we want or they will remain in their own little world defeated by the other party.|`|57bc2e76c4c22f51ec6b0569135c682eaa	I don't think Bush was an idiot.  I think he was a President who was more interested in helping the rich become richer, and had no connection to people who have struggled.  Bush not only could not relate to the suffering in New Orleans, the cleanup was a total rip off too.   I think Cheney, who moved his Halliburton out of the US to escape scrutiny, had a bigger hand in this administration than we will ever know.  <br>  I think Iraq was a total mistake, and if the press had covered it the way it covered Vietnam, it would have ended long ago.  Our allies like Denmark, France, England and Spain who sent their children to die to support our effort were treated like caca.  Condie Rice told the world that with or without them we could do whatever we pleased.|`|0dnfyDWqaa	well people who say he masterminded these things don't call him an idiot people who think all he does is sit behind his desk and read scratch n sniff books call him an idiot...SNL for one and pretty much every other tv show that kids can watch in america has made fun of bush.<br>  <br>  when i watched zeitgeist they didn't call him an idiot even once or question his intellectual ability|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	No, didn't mastermind 9-11, and was inept in dealing with Katrina.

He was on vacation for the entire month of August 2001....and 1/3 of his Presidency.<br>  He waited too long to act on Katrina, but he had help in that disaster from all sides. However, my issue with that is that he was, again, on vacation....and celebrating John McCain's birthday in Arizona WHILE people were drowning to death in the gulf. He went to war with the wrong country. How can you screw that up? He took his eye off the ball (OBL).|`|hNa5oHxQaa	He was an awesome president and will be missed.

axiA5mMoaa	The only way that there will be a change is if he will allow Jesus to do the changing but that requires salvation that the Holy -Spirit will teach him & guild him.

If the rules are the same as when I went through, he will get 10 days of "boot" leave before he goes to either MCT or SOI. He could even get up to a month off if he makes arrangements with his recruiter for recruiter's assistance duty immediately after graduation. He would have to work at the recruiter's office every day but he would be home.

You're proud to be a coward and you want a memorial to honor your fellow cowards?<br>  I agree compulsory service is morally wrong, but you most certainly were not courageous when you ran with your tail between your legs.

JDltTREfaa	This is obviously a fake question, or perhaps a school assignment, but I'm bored so I'll play.<br>  <br>  First of all, I'm guessing that "all you are worth" isn't very much because I doubt that anyone who spent the last 18 months in any type of detention facility, let alone a juvenile one, has a lot of assets.  Secondly, a civil case for a punch in the face against someone with no assets would be in small claims court.  (Meaning there would would be no jury.)   Third, depending on the jurisdiction, the maximum award that is possible in a small claims court generally ranges between $3k and $5k.  Fourth, unless "Jeff" is a minor his family can't sue you.  Fifth, "Jeff" would only be able to recover out-of-pocket expenses and reasonably related pain-and-suffering - so unless you broke bones or teeth, and he had no health insurance I can't imagine an award would exceed $5k anyway.<br>  <br>  And why would spending time in a juvenile detention facility possibly assist with a civil case?  Neither a jury nor a judge tend to be overly sympathetic to convicted criminals.|`|KLg658F3aa	Hopefully they don't go after your parents.

Is Jeff's family suing you for punitive or actual damages?  Restitution should have been resolved as part of the criminal case (if that is why you were in juvie for so long).  <br>  <br>  If you have to go in front of a jury, I'd be telling them that you'd gotten a hold of your temper, are an upstanding citizen now, have graduated at the top of your class, and that you are on your way to Harvard so you can be a service to your community.|`|fgIbNRHfaa	The fact that you have been in juvie hurts.  It shows you have a record, and that a year and a half of being "locked up" did not teach you a lesson.  The best thing that you can do is show how this guy pushed you over the edge.  We have all been there.  Now, no matter what this guy said, it didn't give you the right to hit him.  But if the jury understands just how offensive this guy was, they are more likely to sympathize with you.  Unless you really hurt this guy, I can't see the damages being very much.  Unless your state allows punitive damages in such a case, he can only recover what his damages actually were.  For example, medical bills, lost work, and the "pain and suffering" associated with it. If it was one punch, the damages should be very much.  I am suprised a lawyer even took his case.|`|AA11376640	You just confessed in writing, throw yourself on the mercy of the court. Sounds like you have bad anger issues, I know all about having a short fuse. Unless you injured him really bad, I wouldn't loose any sleep over it. Do not open your mouth, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff, you can not be compelled to open your mouth, I suggest you not!|`|u93oneUXaa	Being in juvie will obviously not help you!  It just shows that you're a troublemaker.|`|HyPN2yleaa	The time in juvie will definently hurt you.  They will see your record and automatically know that you have issues with anger in the past.  You need to be able to control your actions and not resort to violence.  Thats why you probably ended in juvie in the first place.  The court is going to see that you didn't learn your lesson the first time and send you back. You really have nothing to say to the court, no matter what he said, you shouldn't have hit him.  Sometimes its better to just walk away, is it worth getting back into juvie over such a small thing like that?
AA10179458	Who killed a cop? I don't want that person on the streets! Of course it's not his first crime! Sounds like someone needs to go away for a long time.|`|c07v7O80aa	A really good lawyer might get him life without parole instead of death. But it's going to have to be a really good one, backed up by a number of experts. At least his last thought can be, "At least I had a good lawyer."|`|fgIbNRHfaa	If the defendant truly feared for his life or safety, and it wasn't because he was doing a crime at the time and the police were trying to stop him, then a good lawyer can defend against the charges.  But he will have a tough row to hoe.  But the force used must be the force necessary to repel the harm feared.  For example, if he feared the cop was going to beat him up, he cannot use deadily force to stop it.  If he feared deadily force from the officer, but was in the process of trying to kidnap someone at the time, his fear will not justify his actions.  It is also relevant whether the victim was on duty at the time or was in uniform.  If it was a bar fight gone bad and the victim just happened to be a cop, that's a whole other issue.  But obviously he needs a good lawyer, whether it's to beat the charges or simply get them reduced to the lowest charge possible.|`|ba53f32553b904b4453b17e5230bc19faa	i wouldnt trust anyone to properly defend that crime.<br>  i think the person who killed the cop should<br>  get his or her affairs in order<br>  and call the chaplain.

But as to "why" there is still debate:  Some people feel strongly that it is the taking of human life.  Some people don't feel that way.  And sometimes, believing that way doesn't necessarily have to do with a religious belief.  I was a nurse for many years and a D.O. for several more, and I believe that life begins with conception, simply because, medically, I know it may be "just a clump of cells" to some people, but its DNA is human.<br>  And the debate continues in the US, because in the US we are free to believe any way we choose to believe and we have the right to debate that belief.<br>  The "debate" may be over in other countries long ago, but I don't imagine the beliefs of some of the citizens of those countries has changed.|`|g4Dxlklxaa	Because it is supposed to happen. <br>  <br>  God creates man, Man worships God, Man questions God, Man destroys God...<br>  <br>  Then Man destroys himself.

They will protest or shout down anyone that disagrees with them.  The Nazis did that in Germany in the 30's.  A lot of people jumped on the Obama bandwagon just like the Germans did when the Nazis were coming to power.  The similarities are scary.  Their slogan is "change" but what they really mean is socialism.  All Obama has done is spend a lot of money that future generations will have to pay for and no one knows if it will really help.  In fact most educated people don't think it will make a difference.

AA11622716	Most appeals take place while the defendant is in prison.  In addition to appeals there are other ways to seek relief, such as a petition for writ of habeas corpus, a motion for a new trial, a motion to withdraw a guilty plea, and others.|`|AA12109395	In the event your Attorney or perhaps some privately funded advocacy group discovered significantly relative evidence that could affect the outcome of a verdict, a new trial could be requested, still up to the judge to make a determination.<br>  <br>  This happens on occassion whereby a person is retried, acquitted, and released.|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	You can be in prison awaiting an appeal. It's rare, but every once in a while you hear about someone getting released from prison after several years because they won their appeal. The last one I heard of was some guy who spent 17 years in prison, new evidence was uncovered that proved he was innocent, and when he got released the government had to compensate him over $400,000. One in a million maybe, but it happens.

Why would you do that?|`|hZLkzuuiaa	because the popular presidents tackle serious, controversial issues that people feel strongly about. the unpopular ones don't put themselves in that position. or they're like bush, and we just keep them in office to laugh at them|`|hcc8fq7jaa	In Lincoln and Kennedy's cases, their assassinations MADE them more popular, especially historically. They were made into larger than life characters. While JFK was fairly popular, Lincoln was held in contempt by many (North and South) for his trampling of the Constitution, and the horrific war he got us into. Had he lived, he would probably been judged by history as a huge failure.|`|LWzrCu5caa	How come all but Kennedy were Republicans?    Is it that Republicans are more popular or is it the Secret Service does a better job protecting Democrats?|`|qnJRwgKvaa	because popular presidents are more of a threat to the establishment than the stupid ones!!!!|`|IFVrLCNOaa	Well Lincoln was killed after the ending of the Civil War. The country was divided at that time. So, 1/2 the country (confederacy) weren't too happy with Abe.  Kennedy - he won the 1960 election just slightly. He was not totally popular but enjoyed more of a myth after his death. He had the Giancanas help get dead men to vote for him and then stuck his brother on the mob as A/G so that didn't endear him to them. Reagan was attacked by a sole wingnut in love with child actress jodi foster. bush was in for 8 years.  it's just really amazing to think that FDR was unscathed for 12 years during the depression and WW2 when certainly spies would have been interested in him as a target and he certainly must have presented challenges to the secret service due to his paralysis.|`|e5229cd398fab1a52d67a832b2db54c1aa	I have wondered this myself so many times, but the only answer I can come up with is that the unpopular ones promote the assassinations of the popular ones.<br>  <br>  .|`|tY45q3Nraa	the popular ones get too confident and think they can go out in public while ones like Bush already know their *** is grass and stay inside, behind bulletproof everything, and hire an extra whole fleet of protection!|`|idgr5SC5aa	I didn't know Lincoln was popular.

MnjOXJnJaa	if Republicans are starting to talk like conservatives, then yes, they are two-faced. because we can't get one with the nads to run on a conservative platform and save this country from the socialism that LIBERALS are enacting. yes, Republicans were expanding government and spending like liberals, which is why the GOP is part of this mess. but to say that there is no choice but to spend is ridiculous, as our economy needs to be left alone, not "stimulated," and allow capitalism to work. it may not be the perfect system, but socialism is guaranteed to fail. unfortunately, the liberals running this country right now are elitist hypocrite blood-suckers operating under the guise of being "caring." they're exploiting and victimizing us all in the name of creating an uneducated dependent welfare state that will keep electing democrats to keep them down and tell them they are trying to help. are we, as a nation really that stupid, that they can lie to us and make rules that don't apply to them as they stuff their pockets as they take from ours? if your answer is "Yes," give this a thumbs-down,|`|MqXbtvP9aa	NO|`|AA11702773	Ron Paul walks and talks the same way he always did.<br>  <br>  Ron Paul in September  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6rQ0U01Yc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv6rQ0U01...</a><br>  <br>  Ron Paul last week <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d--WEM3vTw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8d--WEM3v...</a><br>  <br>  Ron Paul in 2003 <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4156174553630131591" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <br>  Ron Paul debating the federal reserve governor in 1983.... <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hMeNnbSqkk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hMeNnbSq...</a>|`|4t2kd03Waa	The best example of a socialist is Barack Obama.

The Republicans, on the other hand, would easily have elected Colin Powell in 1996 or 2000.  Condy Rice would have been a viable candidate.

f393dfa601236e7762d7b7ba9e8aa23baa	Cases like yours were decided years ago when the legality and validity of marriages performed by someone not authorized to perform marriage ceremonies was called into question. Quick bit of background: There is a common misconception that the captain of a ship can perform a marriage. This isn't true of any country, and many countries specifically forbid it, but the myth is so widely believed that captains of ships have performed marriages. So were these marriages legal if they were performed by someone who was legally allowed to marry people?

More than likely, you are married and will need a legal divorce, but the validity of the marriage depends on the law of your state.<br>  <br>  In most jurisdictions, you can file a Petition for Divorce without an attorney.  However, if you have children or a house together, I suggest that you call a family lawyer.  This is a very specialized area of the law, and you don't want to make a mistake that could affect such important issues as custody and visitation and spousal support.

d4e41d3df62e651aeb95bc6da71e5eacaa	The problem with Social Security is that almost everybody you talk to thinks it's some kind of savings account for their future. It's almost jaw-dropping how ignorant we are about it. And for the record the Republicans have been warning us for thirty five years that the meltdown was coming. And at the very same time old decrepit frogs like Ted Kennedy stood up in front of congress and the senate and screamed with a red face (look at the newsclips) that the Republicans were crying "wolf". Bill Clinton "rescued" the fund on the backs of tobacco addicts (one of the most insidious and unjust embarrassments in our history) and now gets credit for a balanced budget. (By the way.....smokers now pay almost fourteen times more than their medical care costs!) No other single group has ever been targeted in such a manner.  Democrats are long on ideology and short on facts. I'm a Libertarian (and proud of it) and if you'd bother to find out for yourself what we're about many of you would be too.

It is scary to watch, you cannot just print money (deficit spending) over too long a period.  It is bad enough we had to do it under GW Bush because of the wars.  The Fed cannot play with lower interest rates anymore (they hit bottom), so inflation will ultimately hit (higher interest rates on any kind of loan and on credit) and the economy will remain stagnant until after Republicans are voted in to retake control in 2010 (hopefully).

fac3afb9eafebe44a3441ec97585572eaa	Well you may have answered your own question. You are right the export of jobs reduces what is called the "multiplier effect", or the effect that an active business (Traditionally factories) have on the economy.<br>  <br>  People are hired, they get paid, they pay income tax first, the rest goes to buy things locally, and that money is taxed (sales tax), and then good are used and the cycle begins again. This works unless there is an opening in that cycle for economic leakages.<br>  <br>  The worker gets the goods they want, the govt gets taxes, the business gets good productivity from the worker and gets profits, pay taxes to the govt. They then spend those profits in the economy and hiring more workers and it continues.<br>  <br>  Worker gets a job and paid. Good Thing<br>  Govt gets a lot of various taxes. Good Thing<br>  Business gets profits and expansion and hires more workers. Good Thing.<br>  <br>  Win Win Win! For That Country.<br>  <br>  It is a cycle. Once those types of jobs leave the economy for another, that cycle is broken. Those benefits to the entire economy disappear.<br>  <br>  Here is the cycle since the 1980's:<br>  Factories, Jobs, Tax Revenues, Businesses Move to another country.<br>  <br>  Those thousands of factory jobs are replaced by just a small force of sales and distribution offices that sell or transfer goods from other countries into the the USA. The multiplier effect has shrunk greatly, but in some cases volume increases, though the profits go to fewer people(Administrative staff of a few, and mostly saved.) and are re-invested in the foreign country or at least not spent.<br>  <br>  America has changed from a producer of goods to a transfer agent of goods. Like the difference between an Engineering Team(Highly Specialized) needed to make a product and the Team needed to file transfer sales papers (I don't think you need a GED to do this.)<br>  <br>  Loosing the multiplier effect and trading it for "Financial or Trading Goods", which does not actually produce anything other than transfer is not good.<br>  <br>  It is defined as a Classic Market Failure, because the Production Elements have been separated from the Legal Title. <br>  <br>  I have Legal Title to sell a product in the USA, I sell limited rights for it to be produced in some sweatshop in Thailand, I share the rights with that Thailand Production factory so they can sell it in Thailand. I only am concerned with Selling in the USA. I assemble a sales transfer team of 4 to 5 people or I hire a company to do it for me.<br>  <br>  I then go an sit on a Hawaiian Beach and sip drinks collecting proceeds the rest of my life. How much can I spend in the Economy Compared to the force of the Multiplier effect if I had my factory in the USA? <br>  <br>  There is no way I can spend enough to make up for the economic loss to the USA economy. Because with a factory the money passes though millions of hands, when I spend my "sit on my ***" profits, I end up buying other stuff made in other foreign countries, while the proceeds will bep passed through the the cycle the number of transactions will not be through millions of American hands, but will pass through Millions of Thai hands. <br>  <br>  Benefits to the US economy are gone, Thailand gets the Multiplier effect and the rights to sell my goods in that Country(And the taxes ect). I get the rights to sell in the USA and sit on my *** saving it all in my sales transfer company.<br>  <br>  In the end money does not pass through enough hands in the US anymore. This is the problem.|`|FdZtCnwhaa	Greeeeed!

He knew the conditions there were getting worse. He knew that Hussein was rebuilding his army, and that he was actively trying to rebuild his WMD.<br>  So we had no choice, just like Obama will have no choice if Iran successfully builds nuclear weapons.<br>  The region was too unsettled to just ignore.<br>  Afghanistan will be hard, but it too needs to be dealt with. I am sad the other free nations are not aiding us as I would have expected them to have done.

Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission.<br>  <br>  I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein: You cannot defy the will of the world.

How about government putting him on a cross?  Yet I hear about gitmo from sick in the head liberals every day?  Jesus was about PERSONAL responsibility.  Perhaps if you were to crack a bible instead of trying to politicize it, you could speak with knowledge instead of hate.

Its the con of the conservative that the leaders are. They use the bible to fool the good people yet do not live one iota like the teachings of Jesus, and most of the Republicans do not either. They think the sinners are the liberals if you can figure that one out.  I have a difficult time figuring out where they get the attitude of so much hatred as well, so on occassion I tune in to some fm religious music station which is often dj and callers ranting aabout the sins of abortionist and libs to the extent of printing childrens books named "there is a liberal under my bed " to read to the young ones to start "thinking" that these people are the devil and to be a good christian never listen to the cunning lies that libs will luse to defend themselves. I suspect many of these good intentions of listeners believe so strongly about doing what is right, they never question if what they are told is accurate of not, just blame and shame and hate and defend what they do not realize is against their own interests from actually even happening by voting in the people who prey on their fears and do nothing of what they insist these hardworking people do and teach them to hate the libs or dems not realizing the ones that are totally responsible for many injustices are the Republicans and only tell these ideals but do not live by, so they can be more rich and more powerful, and have supporters to knock down any and evreyone that reallizes the truth or questions it.

fgIbNRHfaa	It depends.  It is really up to the prosecutor, because they enjoy wide discretion.  Especially in domestic battery charges, they will still prosecute even if the victim changes her mind.  But if it's a lesser charge, like criminal property damage or burglary, the prosecutor will often drop the charges if the victim does not want to pursue them.  <br>  <br>  As a practical matter, it is unlikely that the prosecutor can prove their case without the victim's cooperation.  They have the burden of proving guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  If the victim won't testify, it is difficult to convict unless the defendant confessed.|`|AA11966821	If all charges are dropped, the case is dismissed.|`|AA11043457	I get to answer with the biggest answer to legal questions ----<br>  <br>  IT DEPENDS<br>  <br>  If it is a civil suit and the person who filed suit drops the case, then there isn't a court case.  If it is a case where it is a crime, such as assault or domestic abuse, then the prosecutor files that action and if the person refuses to testify, then it is up to the prosecutor as to whether the case is dropped or they go forward.  In that case the person didn't actually file the charges, but reported it and the prosecutor actually filed the charges.<br>  <br>  So civil case is where they go for money.  Now if they tell you they dropped the charges but you have a court date, you go to court and let the judge dismiss the case.  Person could tell you they dropped charges and might not have.<br>  <br>  Unless there was more information can't really say, but this should give you a basic idea of the differences between civil suit (where person files suit) and criminal suit (where prosecutor files suit).<br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.|`|f393dfa601236e7762d7b7ba9e8aa23baa	In a civil case, no, but I suspect you are talking about a criminal case.<br>  In a criminal case, charges are not pressed by the victim, nor can they be dropped by the victim. This is a myth. The victim can only file a complaint through law enforcement or other authorities. It is up to the prosecutors to file the charges or not. Even if the victim decides that they do not want you prosecuted, the case can still continue. You didn't break that individual's personal laws. You broke the laws of the state or the federal government. It is not "John Victim Vs. Sam Defendant", it is "The State vs. Sam Defendant."<br>  The prosecutors may take the victims wishes into consideration and decide that a case is not worth pursuing without the willing cooperation of the victim, but they often proceed anyway.|`|ba53f32553b904b4453b17e5230bc19faa	go to the court.<br>  and ask them. <br>  and if they say no<br>  get it in writing.<br>  you can create an entirely new case<br>  by missing a court date even if its for something that<br>  has been dismissed., if the court didnt get the memo.|`|AA11376640	Yes, unless it is a civil suit.

So you need to be very careful that you do not drink to the point where you do some stupid thing as you can end up spending  your life in jail. And in another country, you might end your life in jail (that can happen here as well).  Do not bring anything that might be contraband back into this country or take it there.  You are better staying on a resort if you are on a resort rather than going into the city to party.  <br>  <br>  Many forget that the laws are not the same and the protections are not the same so be very careful and limit your drinking there.

(It only took me about 30 seconds to find this information through Yahoo Search.) As long as you don't accept the offer of Tuition Assistance you can turn down the offer of a commission. If you sign-up for OCS you are committed to the US Marine Corps. <br>  <br>  "Upon completion of the first summer training session, applicants may begin receiving a $150 per month (tax free) stipend. Upon completing their 4-year degree, applicants are commissioned as 2nd Lieutenants in the United States Marine Corps. Unless one accepts tuition assistance under the program, there is no obligation to join the United States Marines after completion of the course. However, there is also no obligation on the part of the Marine Corps to offer a commission upon completion of the course (although, unless one totally screws up, they usually do)."
JDltTREfaa	Nope.  They can appeal the entire decision.<br>  <br>  (But I wouldn't worry too much.  Judges tend to respect the decisions made by other judges and will not grant an appeal unless there was a very clear error made by the first judge.  Additionally, your landlord wouldn't be allowed to present any new evidence on appeal so the second judge would be making a decision based on the exact same evidence that was presented to the first judge.)|`|fgIbNRHfaa	No, they can appeal the fact that the judge denied their counterclaim as well.

LWzrCu5caa	His issue revolver had ivory grips.   It was a 45 Colt Peacemaker and was the gun often given to Generals as they did not have carry what the rest of the troops carried.   Usually the Army put on pearl grips but Patton said, ""Only a pimp in a New Orleans whorehouse or a tin-horn gambler would carry a pearl-handled pistol" and had it switched out with ivory.  <br>  <br>  He also had a Smith and Wesson 357 mag.  Sometimes he carried both of them at the same time which gave rise to the name,  "Two Gun Patton."   <br>  <br>  Picture is available at the website below.
697f4b7e2abf668416acd21a3fe138f0aa	Because it is not true.  There are laws concerning taxation in the U.S.  For federal income taxes, those laws are found in Title 26 of the U.S. Code.  You can read it at <a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/" rel="nofollow">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/</a> or at <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_26.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://uscode.house.gov/download/title_2...</a>
AA11376640	Ignorance of the law, and stupidity. Some taxes are unavoidable, but you have a choice not to buy anything with a tax on it. Income tax is voluntary and the catch is knowing if you are "subject" to the tax! The only income tax is on interest and dividends, your job is not taxable unless you volunteer by signing a W2 form, by signing it you admit that you are a US citizen, then you are subject. I am not a US citizen, I am a citizen of Kentucky and I haven't paid a nickle in income tax in more than 10 years. Once the IRS accused me of owing them money, I denied it and demanded they prove it; I haven't heard from them since, good luck on your quest for information. Read up on the laws that do, and the laws that don't apply to you.

u9g2Cl6Eaa	Do you really expect an answer from people who ignore the facts below?<br>  <br>  FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|crxbob5jaa	I'm not sure they are socialist, in and of themselves. The socialist aspect comes into play when people who have a large amount of money are expected to fund every program that comes along for the benefit of those who don't have the monetary resources. <br>  <br>  It's one thing to help those who deserve help; hard working citizens who happen to be struggling through no fault of their own. It's another thing to give handouts to those who don't care to work because they can get by better on government handouts. THAT is where I have the problem. <br>  <br>  There are a great deal of problems with today's government involvement in the business of families, citizens, and small businesses. Regulation is one thing, but total control is frightening. Ask the doctors if you want to know their view of nationalized medicine. We won't have the quality of health care that we once had. In fact we don't now because of the presence of HMO's.|`|iuoB7pf0aa	It's socialist because then the government has total control of everything, and that's not the way it's supposed to be. It's really not smart to let them control our health care because then we wen't get good healthcare. Did you know that they're doing that in Canada? And lots of canadians cross into the US to get good health care because in Canada the goverment has control over the health system. That means that the doctors don't make as much money over there, and therefore they don't really care that much about their patients because they no longer have much to work for. Please do your research, it's not smart to let our government control ANYTHING because they do not care about us as people. If they cared they wouldn't spreading  chemtrails all over the skies full of freeze dried viruses and disease to poison us.  If they cared they wouldn't be putting all of the chemicals in our foods that are put there for the sole purpose of making us sick and giving us cancer and diseases for the ultimate goal of killing us off. If they cared about us they wouldn't want the whole world population down to half a billion. You really need to look things up and realize that the goverment isn't your friend at all, it's actually your enemy.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	Good spin - or you're so confused as to be a complete moron.  Education was a local, even family, issue for most of the time since our country started.  Only in the 20th century did gov't co-op education.

Only socialists think that driver's license examiners should be in charge of our health care.|`|NQYKzv7faa	Private education is superior to and cheaper than public.

Yes, they're basic needs but the federal government has NO authority to be involved in such matters. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution delegates all of the power the feds have. If it's not listed there, the government can't legitimately do it.<br>  On another note, why is expecting people to take responsibility for their own lives considered "mean" or "fascist" or any other negative word liberals like to throw around? Personal freedom goes hand-in-hand with personal responsibility, when you expect others to provide you a living, that is socialism.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Not a republican.<br>  Education, health care and most infrastructure funding should be done at the state and local levels not at the national level.<br>  Police and fire are funded locally,  national defense (the military) is the primary function of the federal government as stated in the constitution.|`|D9l4HLKKaa	You work and provide your needs not have Governemnt hand outs.<br>  Move to a socialist Country.<br>  First two are State.<br>  Third is Military and part State and part Fed.<br>  Logic and you are not freinds I see.<br>  The latter three have nothing to do with the first three.<br>  Which are you wanting to argue.<br>  You are weird.|`|TpdVba4baa	Basic needs should be government controlled.

goaxOxzdaa	You're either not typing in the person's information correctly (because of a typo or because the info you have isn't accurate) or the person you're checking doesn't have anything reportable to the agencies you're using to get the background check from.  Adult criminal records, if they have not been expunged, are public records.  So are most entries on credit reports.

And where are you looking?  Are you talking about a criminal background check or a general one?<br>  <br>  It is often difficult to find information on someone who is over the age of 18 but still young . . . unless they've been arrested after the 18th birthday.  Many 18 years olds haven't registered to vote, haven't purchased a home and don't have any other secured loans . . . there just simply isn't much to find.<br>  <br>  If you're certain you have the correct name?  The correct date of birth is important, too.  You can check on www.intelius.com and you can also Google the name of the person.  <br>  <br>  (I've Googled the name of a couple of teenagers who wanted to babysit my children and found some rather interesting information about their party habits, etc.)|`|f393dfa601236e7762d7b7ba9e8aa23baa	In some cases you are required to get the consent of the other party before doing a background check on them.

If the person has not held any jobs, owns no real property, and has never been convicted of a crime, there might not be anything that turns up in a background check. It will be blank.|`|352j4VeVaa	You need to be more specific in your search, are you looking for their address?birthday? phone number? or are you looking to do a full background check with criminal?

Pluralism holds that a variety of political and social ideas, power in general, lies in the hands of a broad and diverse group, while majoritarianism is the elite (major over minor) members of society who make the rules for everyone. Think parliment, except the members are a class of persons who are not voted into office.

It's important for you to look smart, regardless of the consequences to others.<br>  <br>  The liberal elite would, like you, refer to the questioner as "the little guys" but a true liberal elitist would not hide his/her questions and answers.

You sir, don't even have the facts.<br>  <br>  BTW, my answer is in my own words, not cut n paste from the wiki. I did not need help with Pluralism and I read the entire wiki page on majoritarianism, then condensed the major ideas into three sentences.<br>  <br>  Why bother? Because the questioner has made the conscious decision to tollerate the required Government class and get the credits. She has decided that being an informed participant in the world is not important to her, or she would have done her own research. She may be more interested in movie stars, whatever, but to each his own.<br>  <br>  Finally, my silly answer clearly explained that I didn't know the answer.

It is a the idea that democracy is based on but rather than being physical identifying characteristics we rely on social beliefs.<br>  The dangers of this belief is that it can go too far and lead to nationalist views and racism.<br>  <br>  Pluralism is when the minority groups are tolerated in society and them being present may be viewed as highly desirable, such as pro-multicultural views.|`|KiLGNvLeaa	Pluralism=the accepting of different views/points of view<br>  Majoritarianism=the majority rules/ wins etc.

q9PVawNyaa	They already have a model set out for just such a thing and they have been trying to create it since their conception but they can't. Any UN armed force would have to be composed of members of many different nations and certain nations aren't going to be willing to give consent for their troops to be used in a situation that will hamper themselves. If this happens to be one of the Big Five then they will simply veto the idea straight away.

In addition, such force would instigate numerous conflicts as it would force equal representation by every nation, which means that states like Israel could be fighting the U.N. Likewise, any conflicts involving "the army" would castigate regional instability as the countries that contribute to the "army" could be fighting their own country. Thus, the United Nations should not possess a standing security force.|`|etErp8rcaa	This just doesn't work, for a number of reasons. Where would these soldiers come from?

2d8a30b9f6641151f5c5048773c2626caa	Yes--The Peace Corps is part of the government, created by John F. Kennedy to provide appropriately trained men and women to countries that need them as a softer form of diplomacy for America.  The reasons behind the initial PC creation were many, including the call to service by JFK, the need to put people on the ground and show a softer side of America as a shield against Communism, and to give younger people (though anyone over 18 can be in the PC) a chance to live and work in another culture and then bring that information back to America.  Unlike what another ill-informed poster said, the Peace Corps budget is not tied into the CIA's, as that would pretty much defeat the purpose.  In fact, anyone who has ever been a part of the intelligence gathering community can not join the Peace Corps because the intent is to keep those missions separate.  The PC receives a miniscule portion of the overall US budget, and the director is appointed by the President.  So, yes, PC is entirely supported by tax payers.  Most of the money is spent on supporting the volunteers efforts in the countries they are serving in--staff, housing, food, transportation, and a very small living allowance.  After 27 months of service, a volunteer will receive a little over $6000 to help them "readjust" back to the United States way of life.<br>  <br>  This is taken from the Peace Corps website at <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=Learn.whatispc.management.usgov" rel="nofollow">http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shel...</a> "The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is charged with general oversight of the activities and programs of the Peace Corps, and the House Committee on International Relations serves a similar function. The Peace Corps' annual budget is determined each year by the congressional budget and appropriations process, and is part of the foreign operations budget. President Bush has devoted the highest level of funding to the Peace Corps than at any time in the history of the agency. Generally, the Peace Corps budget is about 1 percent of the foreign operations budget."  The current budget is $330.8 million, which supports the staff and nearly 8,000 volunteers in the field.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Yes.|`|pZmdGcf7aa	But of course, we send our brightest and best<br>  young people into third world countries to earn almost no money helping people who desperately need it from their own Government.<br>  And the tax payer pays for it, but the young people don't get the bulk of the money.

Blacks are celled up with blacks, whites with whites, hispanics with hispanics, and everyone else is lumped into a group called "others". Your cellmate would be randomly assigned to your cell. Most inmates follow certain rules of behavior that are imposed and enforced by the inmate population, so you won't have a problem with theft, rape, snitching, etc. A certain level of hygiene would be required. The amount of time you spend in the cell with the person depends on your security level and the facility. You may only spend 8 hours in the cell, or you may spend 23 hours in the cell. It varies. <br>  If you get a cellmate that you do not get along with personally, you can generally request that they be moved, or that you be moved. In most cases, the facility will allow you to choose another inmate with whom you wish to be celled up with. This makes things easier for everybody.<br>  I'm not sure what you consider to be a long period of time. Inmates are moved around a lot, re-classified to different security levels and transferred, etc. It would be unusual to share a cell with the same person for more than a few years. Typically, it will be about one year before one or both of you gets moved.|`|4Hp8mWEpaa	sharing a prison cell? that would depend on who your sharing a cell with|`|B6c7BeDnaa	how the hell should we know! watch lock up or something.|`|aAOgJvjSaa	How the hell could there be any thing good about sharing a prison cell.

gasquENMaa	Some astounding thoughts and answers above me. Inmates can write to anyone they wish. Outbound mail is not allowed to be opened or inspected unless we have a court order stating for us to do so ( this is usually for predator's cases with priors behind them).<br>  <br>  All inbound mail ( you writing to him) will be opened and inspected for contraband and gang related writing. It is not "read", but scanned. Each department has their own rules about what is allowed to be sent in ( number of pictures, type of pictures ( most will not allow polaroids), extra sheets of writing paper, embossed envelopes, etc.)<br>  <br>  Best advice is to call the facility and ask for the mail room. They can tell you what you might be allowed to send in. As far as standard letters go, you can write as long a letter as you want. There is no limitation to the length of a letter. Write in english. If the inspecting officer cannot understand what is written, the letter is considered contraband and will not be allowed in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck and I hope this is useful to you<br>  Source(s):<br>  5 years with the Sheriff's Department and 20 years as a Corrections Officer in a max prison|`|4eaf3b65b8bcd61e0c28ed377fb53935aa	pen and paper (some places have email).  most letters are scanned to make sure nothing inappropriate is coming in (drugs, etc)|`|M1IzK37Zaa	Well depends on if your sending mail or or they are sending mail out Either way it is searched an most of the time they are read by prison officials before going out or in.Just to make sure there isnt any contraband or anything like that an also to make sure neither party are like making threats an such|`|wg8SQQjEaa	knowing how to spell would be a great first step, along with sentence structure, and possibly punctuation. <br>  for the record, it is spelled "writing".|`|ldjbDE3Kaa	people use punctuation
w5smOXssaa	I would suggest that you think back to all the other "permanent" majorities. For example, the Democrats controlled both the House and the Senate from 1933 until 1981, with only two, two-year long "hiccups." That's 48 years. The Republicans had a majority for 12 years, including one hiccup, and have not been in the majority for the last four years. That means, that your "permanent majority" is one fourth the length of the Democratic Majority, and already has had more six years of "hiccuping."<br>  <br>  Nothing is permanent in politics, ever. And the fact that you have enough hubris to think that your party will remain in power forever shows you have as much foresight as Adolf Hitler, and hey, he only said it would last 1,000 years. I'm sure he though D-Day was a hiccup too.<br>  <br>  And finally, whether you like it or not, the man is your President and Commander in Chief so you may refer to him as a) Sir, b) Mr. President, or c) President Obama. Honestly, have some patriotism and stand by the Constitution, you are stuck with him for at least four years.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	lol...keep thinking that. You'll notice that it wasn't just Obama winning  in November....but Democrats across  the board.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	70% of America supports Obama. The majority of the House and Senate is Democrat. So where's the republican majority you are talking about? Must be in la la land.|`|qnJRwgKvaa	Republicants are 0-2 in the last two elections and old man McSame lost the white house by over 6 million votes a new record....  and you believe in a permanent republican majority huh???? wow<br>  <br>  by the way.....  wanting a one party country means you could be shot for treason!!!!|`|ujxh8Pb2aa	The Republican party is a splintered mess, you better start getting it in order if you even want to survive, much less EVER be the majority again. LOL|`|m8f7rnBEaa	No, it's just a hiccup in the long, slow Republican slide to oblivion.|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	You got a problem with Democracy?|`|RElSzZtyaa	I think you are misunderstanding the word majority as it pertains to our political system. A party can have Majority in the U.S. Congress, meaning the majority of the senate and house of representatives belong to on party. The Democrats have had the majority since 2006. Before that the republicans had the majority for about a decade or so, and before that the democrats had it. <br>  <br>  As far as whether or not Obama's presidency will be the beginning of a long line of Democratic leadership,  or if it is only going to last for four years, is really hard to say. Politics runs in cycles, the democrats won by a landslide in the past election, it wasn't luck. However, the 2012 election will depend a lot on what President Obama can do for our country in the next 4 years.<br>  <br>  <br>  Personally, I really hope that things turn around in 2012. I understand that the democrats that have written before me might not really understand how the system works, they also don't realize that not all republicans are George Bush. One day they will see the light.<br>  <br>  Also, anything over a 50% approval rating is good... the best presidents our country has had have not been able to get it much past 65%|`|W2pvqhbkaa	You mean the former KKK that previously ran this country.  <br>  <br>  The people finally saw the worship of the almighty dollar far exceeded the well being of this country and decided they had had enough. <br>  <br>  These people not only benefited the rich taking from the rest of the country that wasn't enough they had to deceive the world in so many ways.  I hope men that believe themselves superior and money is God never have a say so in anything ever again.<br>  <br>  It is almost as if these people were taught to do the opposite of the Ten Commandments.|`|OugNf0x6aa	If you think Obama is doing so poorly in office, how much better would McCain's policy served you? He offers the greatest tax relief to the wealthy, and wants to trust our crumbling health care in the hands of greedy insurance companies.|`|GIxvzkA9aa	We will not regain a permanent majority unless we kick out all the moderate (closet liberal) traitors out of our party forever.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Obama has been below 60% approval rating all weekend.<br>  <br>  57% yesterday 58% today.|`|bCkw8E8faa	for sure... he;ll bury the democrat party...<br>  hes the great prosperity killer.
zrHLiU0Faa	Well, one great thing we can do is support our soldiers. You know, ensure they receive the health care and rehabilitation they will need when they get home.

ZtOkzYhYaa	Well, in theory the constitution provides for powers to the state in a vast array of areas. However, in practical terms the states have lost almost all of their sovereign power. The implications of this is, of course, that their exists an open contradiction within the theoretical and practical operation of the constitution. This being to such a degree as to suggest that the constitution is totally invalidated.|`|SnanuNKiaa	slightly.

I think it is the success and strength they hate rather than just its leader.   We are all somewhat jealous of those who are more successful than we are.

They hate Bush because he behaved like a bully, he lied, he conned, he manipulated,  and he doesn't seem to grasp the simple fact that for every action there is a RE-action,  (blow-back) and "our leaders" keep stealing their resources and giving "rights" to corporations to "manage" (read steal) whatever interests them. We just can't leave other countries to decide for themselves what is best for THEM, we keep imposing on them OUR version of what they should be.  There are over 6 BILLION NON-Americans that NEVER voted for "our" president, nor did they vote for our intervention into their affairs.  They hate that, just as we would hate another "leader" or country deciding how WE should live our lives.<br>  We have troops stationed in 130 of the 195 countries, can you just imagine what WE would think if ANY other country decided to station THEIR troops in America?  We NEVER wage a war with a country that doesn't have something that corporate America wants control of.  Bush did more than any other president to further corporate control of other countries, therefore he is hated more than most, but he certainly isn't the first to decide to further corporate interests at the expense of others. <br>  More rational countries and their populace don't hate Americans as much as they hate our policies and they realize that it's our "leaders" and not the citizens that are the problem.  They realize that we are pawns, just like they are.  <br>  We claim to be "spreading democracy", but many of the countries that we have interfered with HAD democracies UNTIL we "intervened" and destroyed it and replaced their elected leaders with our "puppets".<br>  We train terrorists in this country at the "School of the America's" in GA. and then send them to their homeland to terrorize their own people.  MS 13 is one group we trained that has now come back to haunt US. (blow-back)<br>  There are groups in America that thing they have the right to rule the world and all of it's resources (PNAC), and they are using OUR military, OUR money, and OUR resources to accomplish this - they ONLY have THEIR interests in mind, they are working on destroying the US as we know it as well.  Their idea of a perfect society is the ultra wealthy elite running the world and eliminating the middle class and turning US into a third world country - the rich VS the poor.  They are doing much to accomplish this in America without firing a shot.|`|OTZX1jbbaa	They all have big holes running through them that nothing, not even hate, can fill. But, from my experience from living abroad for three years, it is mostly a hatred (jealousy) of the US in general. US citizens living in the US who hate the US should go live somewhere else. I lived in the UK, our closest ally and another first world nation. Believe me, we have it sooooo much better than they do. Here, the people run the government. There, the government runs the people and everyone is trying to grab for whatever little bit of power they can hold on to.<br>  <br>  We've got it good. They know it. They're jealous of it.|`|2BWyZOy5aa	They hate not only Bush but everything America really stands for.  They like Obama because Obama promises to change America from America and into something foreign.|`|N1gd7juqaa	THEY GOT THERE OWN DAMN PROBLEMS .|`|TuizUTZCaa	The United States of America needs to remove the reason why these people dislike you. They don't hate the United States they hate foreign policies directed at them. Of course, there is different policies directed at different countries. The world knows why you have policies against Cuba, because it almost started a nuclear war by allowing Russia to place war heads there in the sixties. This policy is by all means the right one to have. Chavez on the other hand is a TWIT to say the least, by buddying up to Iran's President I think he is just asking for trouble and if he keeps up the rhetoric I think something should be done. Russia on the other hand is not a problem. The U.S. and Russia just have different agenders and sometimes these agenders clash. While some policies were introduced by George Bush, some were brought in by Bill Clinton and so on. If the United States does the right thing by the world, than the world will do the right thing by the U.S.. If someone hated the U.S. because George Bush was the President then I guess they wouldn't now, but if they hate the U.S. , then I guess they will always hate you. But then again there will always be someone who dislikes someone else.|`|b22d33b389f66522a42da38105df85caaa	If you look at history, you'll see that Castro (Fidel, that is) has been in the business of hating America since 1948, so this is one thing you can't blame President Bush for.<br>  <br>  Any dictatorship hates the USA; they hate the ideology of the USA and also the freedom of choice we have over here. <br>  <br>  God help any of those leaders when their population starts to believe in their own powers and kick those "no goodniks" out.|`|xyOKb0meaa	Mostly Bush and the US government, but not the US people.

Needless to say the DS smoked him bad...........Good luck man|`|iqi8bYyDaa	I went to fort jackson in 2004. It wasnt easy and you dont get much sleep. I am a female so physically it was a little more challenging for me because of my size. I  loved it though and made some great friends. I suggest just being on your game, and take it seriously. The drill sgts yell and scream in your face, but they are only doing it to break you down mentally. The drill sgts really lighten up on you after about a month or so. The hardest part is the road marches. You will have I believe about 5 or 6 of them. You have to carry you M-16, kevlar, lce pack, ruck sack which alone weighs about 40lbs. The road marches start about 2 miles, but the very last one is 12 miles and it suuuuucks. You have to do a 3 day march and camp out, that is your very last thing. I could tell you alot more, but if you have anymore questions post them on here and id be happy to answer. Have fun, make great friends, and be proud of yourself.

D81XrnY9aa	Only you can decide which is a better fit for you, but I will tell you the ANG is very college-centric and offers a lot of college benefits. I am very partial to the ANG as I have been in for 7 years now and went 4 straight years of college using all the benefits and graduated with zero loans to my name in May 2007. My plan was to get out after college and my 6 years was up.....re-enlisted for another 6 last year because I want to stay in.<br>  The ANG does not have a deferment program like the Army National Guard does and does not have the split option route either. Most ANG recruits are seeing a 4-6 month wait to go to BMT and Tech school and it is hard to get dates to split it up for summer only. I can almost guarantee you that you will have to miss one semester to get your training done. Do not worry though, just do it and then return to college. I took a year off right after high school to get my training done, still graduated with most of my friends who went to college that year. Th training is fun, challenging and more rewarding than you can even think of. Returning to college after what you have accomplished in the ANG will be a great experience. College was a breeze for me and I can attribute that to the AF showing me great ways to learn and apply your training. I was a C-B student in high school and went to college and graduated with a 3.82 Cumulative GPA....so yes, it changed me and helped me acquire the skills to listen closely and learn.<br>  Florida pays 100% tuition, gives you the GI Bill and some jobs are giving a 20K bonus, so what are you waiting for.....get going with this and experience life! See the world!<br>  email me and I will get you the contact info for the ANG recruiters in your area.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	I know the Army Guard offers split option training during consecutive summers and the Army Guard also offers the 2 year college first stabilization.  The only catch is you can't get College First and Split Op.  YOu have to do one or the other.  The Guard also may be better than the Reserves for you because some states have extra college tuition assistance programs for their Guardsmen that federal Reservists do not qualify for.  You will have to talk to an Air Guard recruiter to find out specifically what qualifies and what is available nearby.|`|FEAWVuOuaa	I think you are great. Do you have any idea how many young men and women waste their time by selling and using drugs, having kids out of wedlock and by committing crimes, you are actually doing something worthwhile and you should be proud of yourself. I like the Air National Guard myself. Good luck buddy, proud of you. <br>  <br>  Also just some advice, don't try to do to much at once, focus on one thing and do your best on it.  Again, good luck.
TnDFT313aa	They have what are called AGR jobs which are active guard jobs.  They're like m-f jobs that the guard needs.  Mostly for personnel and that sort of thing.

HvbIE03saa	Sorry this doesn't answer your question, but I can't stand it when people say that the Marines "fall under the Dept. of Navy" as if the Navy is a branch of the US Armed Forces and the Marines are a branch of the Navy. <br>  <br>  The Marine Corps and the Navy are two separate branches that support each other and just happen to be headed up by the same Dept. (The Dept. of the Navy - which by the way should technically be called The Dept. of the Navy and Marine Corps, to be accurate).<br>  <br>  Hell, the Coast Guard is also headed up by the Dept. of the Navy (during wartime) but you don't hear people saying that if the Coast Guard wants something that they get it from the Navy.<br>  <br>  Two separate branches people!<br>  <br>  Lars - I apoligize, you are correct about the CNO. I was under the impression that he was a civilian like the SecNav, not the highest ranking member of the Navy, like the Commandant is of the Marine Corps.<br>  <br>  However the Coast Guard does fall under the Dept. of the Navy during Wartime if the President chooses, and under the Dept. of Homeland Security during Peacetime.|`|b6d207b7421df3840cc19062f2df25deaa	Like someone said, they are a department of the navy, the mens department, but if they need a ride there is always the squids.|`|XzStbSPnaa	The US NAVY SEA BEE's work for the Marine corps also.

He is the equivalent of the CNO, all branches have one.  All the highest ranking officers are the head of their own branch and are part of the Joint Chief's of Staff.<br>  <br>  And the USCG never falls under the Navy.  They fall under Department of Homeland Security and before 9-11, Department of transportation.  <br>  <br>  Now on to the answer.  Unfortunately Marines can not be SWCC as it is solely a Navy rate.  It is the same as a sailor can't be Force Recon.  I have seen Marines cross over upon their EAOS and join a Navy NSW/NSO rate but that would be the only way, and it is very rare.|`|QKlIwkMNaa	Well, the Marines fall under the Department of the Navy, if there are Marines that need a SWCC, the SWCCs will be there.
ylj2PTFFaa	Both are good choices and the only branches you should look at.  <br>  <br>  Marines are more "gun-ho" and the military persona consumes you and your fellow marines.  They are usually more respected in terms of toughness due to the bootcamp (which is the toughest of the military) and their refusial to change their standards.  You have less advancement opportunities due to the smaller numbers. But once again, the few and the proud, makes you just that.<br>  <br>  Army is much larger.  Over the past 5-years or so they have gotten more relaxed in terms of their bootcamp and standards. However, they have a bigger budget that the Marines and there are MANY MANY more specialization oppotunities.  They have better equipment and technology than the Marine.  They are also less "gun-ho".<br>  <br>  One of the biggest differences that is that if you ask a navy man what he does, he said he is in the navy... you ask a army soldier what he does, he says he is in the army... you ask a marine soldier what he does... he says he is a marine.<br>  <br>  <br>  It all depends on what you wanna do.  Look at all the job possibilites.  The army has more opportunites in terms of jobs and advancement.  Marines though.... well they are the marines.|`|wf9RHP3Eaa	There are small differences between each branch of service. Pay and benefits are the same no matter what branch you join. The differences are in methodology, tactics, uniforms, etc. Ultimitely we all serve the same purpose.<br>  <br>  I've been in for 14 years and yes, I would do it all over again. I can't tell you any stories, but I know I'm a better person because of the military than I would have been otherwise.<br>  <br>  Go talk to recruiters and see which one you like the most.|`|0s30aQC6aa	Marines in general and their officers in particular are encouraged to act much more independently than their army counterparts. But Marines are also held to a much higher level of accountability. If you are in charge you had damn well better be in charge. Excuses are not excepted ever and there is no passing the buck.

Making it part of the U.S. would be taking on a massive uneducated, impoverished underclass that the middle-class here would have to subsidize and support.

i0vcEyJtaa	You're correct. The New Deal prolonged the depression, Obama is wanting to create jobs, give more to banks, fund the public sectors, yet with a socialistic/interventionist policy. Interventions in the markets won't work, the government will only continue to encourage bad banks with bad credit, fund more for welfare, health care, which will create a staggering amount of inflation, and Obama will prolong the recession with hyper-inflation, which will put the Dollar in a bad situation. Wiemar Republic did a smiliar situation with this, and they failed. Nazi Germany in the 1933 did the same thing, they failed. Japan did this in the late 80's, they failed as well. The latest economic stimulus didn't work, and this stimulus won't work either.

T2WPvUc1aa	Environmentalists may not actively attempt to kill people, but they couldn't care less if their policies do cause death and destruction. The recent wildfires in Australia were far worse than they would otherwise have been, if not for environmental policies that prohibited people from cutting trees and brush on their property.  Because people were prohibited from cutting trees and bushes on the perimeter of their property, the fires spread from said trees and bushes, to their homes. <br>  I recently read an article on this, but cannot find the link. I do have another link that tells about this incident.<br>  Many people lost homes, and several lost their lives, because the government did not let them cut foliage that they knew was a fire hazard. One homeowner who violated the law and cut the trees anyway, was fined $50,000.00. However, he was the only one for several miles who still had a house to live in after the fires went through his area.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	This all seems like you made it up, but if you are telling the truth, feel free to post a link, I'll be happy to answer your question more thoroughly.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	There are some that wish we would go extinct (see provided link). <br>  <br>  Honestly, I get a little bit worried about the mindset of some people concerning the whole population issue.

AA11043457	We sometimes make poor choices that continue to haunt us and I'm afraid that he was yours.<br>  <br>  When he tried to run you off the road, I hope you contacted the police about the incident and filed charges.  Anytime he does somethng like that you need to file.<br>  <br>  You need to see an attorney and to see about getting back the things he took from you. The crib was your families before he came along.  It was not something you acquired in the relatinship, as was the coin collection.  You were not married so I don't know why you can't file theft charges or a civil suit to get them or the money back.  Or go to small claims court for that.  An attorney can better tell you what your rights are when you were not married to the man.<br>  <br>  You need to keep a calendar to document when visitation is and when he didn't make it or asked for another date.  If it is not a time when you already had somethng planned, then  you probably need to go along with it.<br>  <br>  If he was abusive to you, then  you need to assume that he could be abusive to your child.  Why was the supervised visitation stopped?  Is there any way to keep that going to protect your child.<br>  <br>  He is going to try to manipulate you and the courts as much as he can.  Therefore you need to document everything.  If  your child ever comes home with bruies, you need to take pictures and take her to the family doctor and then contact children's services to make a complaint.<br>  <br>  You don't need to explain anything to him.  You are being a victim in that.  You need to stop.  He will try to manipulate  you and you need to not allow that If you go to court, you need to state the facts and have documentation.  If he rants about something or claims something that isn't true, you need to state the facts to the judge and to indicate that he was verbally and emotionally abusive to you and that he did try to run  youoff the road (need your witnesses or the police reports) and then it is up to the judge to believe or not. Don't try to convince the ex. He isn't going to change his ways.  You may have to deal with this 18 years unless you limit your contact.  You do have to allow visitation as the court orders it.  But if there are signs of abuse,  you need to get those documented and to do what  you can.  If he threatens you, then  you need to go to the police and see about filing charges (it can be an assault if he threatens you and you believe he can carry it out and fear that.  You can file for protective order.<br>  <br>  Now I hope I am advising something that you never have to use but when a man is verbally and emotinally abusive, he often escalates to physical abuse as well and he is controlling.  That is the problem right there.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes you have more rights in a marriage than you have in living together.  Yet there are some advantages as well.  You should have more rights to your personal property than you might have in a marriage.  <br>  <br>  But bottom line is how much you want to fight for things that may not mean a lot.  Right now you and your daughter are the most important  here.  If he comes by to harass you, you can file a restraining order or have him ordered to stay away except for visitation and if you have to file restraining order, you should also ask for supervised vistiation.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Maybe he will find someone else and move on.  <br>  <br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.|`|1lfgh3KPaa	wow you're a judgmental skank! You have no right to judge him like that. How dare you!

That's what you are paying them for!  Ask the Court to order the appointment of a mental health professional to conduct psychological evaluations of you and your ex (in the interest of the child) and perhaps to order parenting classes to help him learn how his behavior is affecting the child.

Tape him and videotape him, he's stupid and soon enough he'll show his true colors and tah-dah!  You'll have the proof you need. <br>  <br>  You can also request a different judge, be sure and do that since the one you now obvously has brain-damage. <br>  <br>  Don't believe what people tell you about your little girl needing to have contact with her daddy.

You could take defensive driving usually with a guilty plea, and just pay court fees and the DD fee.  Another way I have heard is to keep sending in postponement requests until they deny you (usually 6+months).  Then go in and plead not guilty and say you were past the sign.

But if you fight a ticket and lose, and you will lose, you can't go to traffic school<br>  <br>  Remember most people here are guesssing, just as well as you can guess. Take it from someone who knows.
AA11494150	The rank structure is determined by the department. The most common are:<br>  <br>  Corporal<br>  Sergeant<br>  Lieutenant<br>  Captain <br>  Chief<br>  <br>  Larger departments may include other ranks such as Major,  Colonel and Assistant Chief above Captain. The investigation division may also have their own ranks.|`|u37jksU0aa	My department has a very basic structure...

Unfortunately, certain crimes as a minor will bar you from these jobs, and yours is one of them. Since law enforcement deal with evidence all the time and must be reputable with regard to the chain of evidence, they can't have people with convictions for destruction of or tampering with evidence.<br>  The Department of Corrections has lower standards than most other law enforcement agencies, so if you were turned down by corrections you will likely be turned down by the others as well.|`|AA11376640	If it wasn't a felony offense I would sue the police department for discrimination!|`|ba53f32553b904b4453b17e5230bc19faa	ask about expungement prodeedings|`|goaxOxzdaa	You want to be cop and you've committed a felony offense involving the falsification and/or destruction of evidence, in other words, you attempted to hide the truth and manipulate the system for your own personal gain.

At 18 your record should have been expunged.  Even then if they ask if you have ever been convicted of a crime, you have to say yes and then explain or it is lying on an application and you could be fired.<br>  <br>  You might be able to get an attorney and get that overturned - there is a name for it but I can't recall it, but it isn't just sealed as in a juvenile record but more or less overturns it.<br>  <br>  An attorney could probably find out for you ut it will cost you to have this done.  You might go to the academy or to a JVS with a law enforcement program and talk to them about the requirements and discuss the fact that you were arrested as a juvenile.  12 is  young and  you can make that argument that  you have learned from that.<br>  <br>  but you may now be wanting a career that is beyond  you because of your previous record, even though expunged.  It is worth checking it out now though so you can work toward another career if this error is going to keep you from your goal.<br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion.
YFzprqqgaa	I would rather live in a sheet metal shack in an Obamaville and beat the ground with a garden hoe to get a garden to grow than live as a socialist.

Americans are living the proof that our economy works without socialism. If socialism is required to fix the economy, then it has already failed. So yes I would let it sink and start a new economy based on a day's pay for a day's work. We've gotten along pretty good without socialism for two centuries, think we could risk going on without it for at least another two centuries.|`|wg8SQQjEaa	dont worry kiddo. i happen to have "economics for dummies" on my bookshelf|`|lN6YpWH4aa	Socialism can only fix the economy if you consider making everyone equally poor and miserable to be a solution. Government involvement is what created the problem to begin with. Laissez faire, free market capitalism is the only system that works. It offers the most opportunity to the most people. In a free market, people have only themselves to blame for not succeeding.|`|1ZN4e4LDaa	Socialism isn't the complete answer, but 40 years ago I told a few people that what this country needs is a good dictator for 4 years and then get him out of office and start all over again. Get rid of all politicians and all lobbyist(scourge of washington and this country). Start fresh with the national debt set to zero and Wall Street not running or ruining the country, however you want to say it. I know its the fairytale, but we can always dream.<br>   Socialism has never worked and if we come under socialism the government will fail!|`|qPEd5j2Iaa	In the first place, Socialism won't make, or keep, us strong. If it did that why can't the rest of the world defend itself? (except for the Communist nations - would you live under Communism if it kept us strong?).  Name a european nation that can defend its own borders. Socialism is the reason we won't defend our own. If anything will turn America into a third world nation it will be socialism. Name me another Nation that has given more for the improvement, safety, health and wellbeing of other nations (including socialist, communist and other dictatorships) - name me a socialist, or Communist one. The wealth and strength to do it came from Capitalism.  If you contend that Capitalism is a failure then it is so because we have allowed Socialistic programs and laws  to interfere with it. Those who wish to live with the Governments hand on their shoulder because they are afraid to make their own decisions, or  believe they are owed a certain standard of living and think people who are doing ok somehow owe them the sweat off of their brow, are part of the reason we are in trouble now. <br>  Would you go up to someone you don't know and DEMAND a handout?  If not, then why would you expect Government to do it for you. That makes you a coward for not having the guts to do it yourself, and a thief by proxy! No: I'll live in a Capitalist nation where my sweat earns rewards for me and MY family. - not for anyone who "just can't cut it! Charity, by force, is nothing less than theft. Charity begins at home - but NOT with politicians telling who gets it and how much. Compromise doesn't make one stronger, but it can, and has, eroded away the moral and ethical principals that made us a great nation in the first place! I have busted my buns to own my own home. Liberal Government has done more than anything else to make it harder for me. That they now want to steal from the well off to allow those, without the where-with-all to pay, to have a roof over their heads REALLY P***es me off.  Let them work for it as I've had to do!|`|AA11702773	That is stupid because socialism would BE a failure of the economy.  I would rather we started over.  We wouldn't be third world.

I know that Karl Marx said that the fall of  capitalism is inevitable, but he was writing during the industrial revolution and couldn't have foreseen the complexities of the market and production today. <br>  <br>  Until you prove to me that socialism is the only way, I'm not on board. There are other 'isms' to choose from, you know.

The market will right itself.  It will be hard, and many people (mostly those who made bad decisions) will be hurt, but the country will eventually right itself if left alone.  I mean, why would capitalists allow a system that made them rich to fail?|`|ERGGLvYiaa	There is nothing wrong living in a 3rd world nation if it also has fresh water and good fertile land which the USA does.

Why do you want a few rich people in the government telling you how to run your business? Or your health care? Socialism won't fix the economy, it will pile up debt and increase taxes on those who actually make money. Socialism seeks to make everyone equal by bringing everyone to the lowest common denominator. Capitalism seeks to make everyone equal by allowing everyone the opportunity to rise to the highest common denominator. While not everyone will be rich, everyone has the same opportunity to become rich.|`|noo8vpvzaa	There's no such thing as a "strong socialist country"...Why don't liberals understand that?<br>  <br>  Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  If someone convinced you that shooting you in the head would be good for your health, would you rather not be shot?...Would you let your will to live win over the desires of a party's agenda?|`|RsDZu7iNaa	He drops back to the three point line....hut..hut...hike...field goal!!!!

Failure means the complete collapse.  The economy would continue falling until it hit a floor that would be, at the worst, 90% of previous productivity.  The economy would be bad for a few years and recover, as it has dozens of times over the past 250 years.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, socialist reforms might increase the floor level.  However, the long term result would be a permanent depression due to the elimination of basic necessities for a successful economy.<br>  <br>  Presented with these two options, you would have to be a complete retard to choose the latter over the former.|`|NQYKzv7faa	Give me liberty, or give me death!<br>  <br>  That is a false choice.

Whats wrong with working hard, and reaching you goals.With socialism there is no opportunity, you do as the gov't says, and pay higher taxes, for the good of who?

But, if I was in your position and wanted it back, I'd go to the pawn shop and get it back.  If you go to the police station, I am sure they will tack it onto her charges and hold onto to it.

Generally stolen property is just returned (it wouldn't be fair to confiscate the victim's property... the government keeping your stuff wouldn't be very different from your ex's stealing it).

You need to go through the police. Once they document it as stolen, and verify that you are the legal owner, they can return it to you. They may, however, decline to investigate the case. If she took it while living with you, for example, they are likely to decide that it is a civil matter. In such a case, you would only get it from the pawn shop by paying for it, and then proceeding with a small claims case to recover the money from your ex (which would be a waste of time).|`|JgsreLmUaa	If she is all ready sentenced for the crime. you have a good chance getting it back.if not it could be used as Evidence then returned to you.but by all means check with a lawyer first,that's the only trueway to know.|`|diaK7Awgaa	Regardless of the fact that you paid for it, it is still technically stolen property, which means they can keep it.

That was one of the huge problems.  He did everything he could to make the Executive branch trump, which is not how it works.  Supposed to be balanced.  And no, he didn't cause the hurricane, but he certainly knew ahead of time that the levees wouldn't hold and did nothing about it.  Then, he couldn't even get water to a city in our own country.

It's not a criminal matter. Theft requires that someone TAKE the item without legal consent. You willingly loaned it out. This is an unlawful conversion, a civil matter.<br>  Small claims is your only option. You can recover the fair market value of the guitar and court costs. Don't bother asking for more than that because you're not going to get it. They won't pay you extra for the hassle. If the judge decides that the fair market value is less they can lower the award amount.<br>  Be prepared to document the exact amount you are asking for.<br>  Keep in mind that a judgment simply means that a court has ruled that this person owes you money. The court will not collect it for you. You must collect it from the person. If they don't do so willingly, it is up to you to find out where they work to garnish their wages, or if they have any property or bank accounts that you can place a lien upon.
DTSUJe2oaa	NO, because she has not legally abandoned her she placed her with someone she trusted to care for her and that is all that is required under Oklahoma law, if the sister does not want to care for the child any longer perhaps she would allow you and the child's father to step in until the mother returns, once a child enters protective services it can sometimes be very difficult to get them back.~
AA11707728	That's a pretty serious charge with some very serious consequences.  Frank abandonment of your children is illegal in this country.  She could go to prison.  However, it has to be much more than her leaving a child with a relative and then putting upon them to continue caring for them a little longer.  For example, she's out on a drug binge or something.  Or she doesn't call.  Or her sister refused to take the child and she just left them there.  In those cases, you call the cops and the cops will bring in a case worker from child protective services (or whatever they call it in oklahoma).  They will investigate.  If they find behavior going on that endangers the child, they will probably place the girl in the custody of your husband temporarily while the thing moves through the court system. Things have to be pretty serious for the court to intervene though.|`|ba53f32553b904b4453b17e5230bc19faa	call protective services.<br>  but <br>  if you are her step mother then its your responsiblity to get her if you think she's in harms way.<br>  where is he?<br>  idiot.<br>  this is actually his problem<br>  dont get dragge d in.<br>  just tell him to deal with his family.and go to a movie.

XIiS5VKLaa	What they lack is autonomy. They depend on trade and interaction with the controlling government to survive. Their individual identities as states and cities respectively, exist in their being controlled by a larger government. Cities and states are governmental and therefore mental constructs with little or no philosophical meaning in and of themselves. This brings in a whole lot of deeper questions, so I'm just going to scratch the surface. Suffice to say these things exist because civilized society recognizes a need for order to prevent overall chaos.
f931be7e45f5d51817c8a31a462b08d4aa	To my knowledge, most recruiters want to make sure you are in good standing with your health, with the law, and with your bills. <br>  <br>  If you are 30 days behind, then unfortunately it is not unusual that this recruiter is telling you this.

What job did you want to do for the Air Force? Chances are the Army has the same job.

He is ranked the 4th most powerful person in the world, and he is certainly the most powerful economic policymaker in the world, because the decisions he makes decisively influence the outcome of the nation’s economy.|`|Vu7kCPesaa	To rape the dollar for everything it's worth.<br>  <br>  <br>  Officially: to create money from thin air to loan to the government, with interest, which we then use for all monetary transactions.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	The fed reserves main goal is the cartelizing banks and buying up government bonds.

My sister had a 2 yr old when she and her husband were divorced.  She received a small monthly check for child support and, although she had a job, it was a low-paying one. She received food stamps & Medicaid for about 1 1/2 yrs until she got a higher paying one.  <br>  <br>  Helping people get back on their feet by paying full monthly benefits, or supplementing income people already have, is what welfare is really all about.

Is it that the bank if afraid of going under? Think about it, in a bad economy, rates usually go down to keep things moving, without providing any loans because of high rates, the bank stands to loss revenue, considering the bank is not gaining much from its investments which have decreased in value as much as anything else in the economy. If you never listen to the show you would have no clue as to what is discussed, so your comment about "right wing goof balls" is just as offensive as any comment the "older lady" made. Being a Christian you should have enough knowledge to know this. As I am repulsed by your belief that you can consider a whole the product of a small percentage and be so judgmental about others you have no concept about. Sorry but this is not a very good example of what being a Christian is.
Vu7kCPesaa	First off, I don't use tobacco in any form so I can't really be called an expert. <br>  <br>  From discussions I've had with many friends that smoke, I've learned that some of them like to sometimes smoke menthols, and sometimes just want a regular cigarette. Crushes let them choose either or. Several of them also like to smoke half of the cigarette regular and half as menthol. As I said, I don't smoke so I don't know the appeal, but I do know it is a very popular thing to do.<br>  <br>  As for snus, I know a lot of guys are trying to switch from dip to snus. The process involved in making snus causes far fewer carcinogenic by product... meaning you can do it much more with far less risk of mouth cancer than standard dip. I actually frequent a forum full of guys pushing to switch to snus, and these are all guys well above the legal age to use tobacco products.<br>  <br>  So, while it may be more appealing to teens that will use these products before they reach legal age, in the tobacco manufacturers defence, there is actually a growing user-base of appropriately aged users.

El proceso sigue requiriendo de solicitudes y entrevistas, y ahora incluye el ingreso y verificación de nombres en una sofisticada base de datos del gobierno de los Estados Unidos. Es importante que los solicitantes de hoy tengan en cuenta que los procesos de verificación y registro son elementos necesarios y cruciales para la protección de nuestros ciudadanos y turistas. Debido a esto, muchas visas requieren varias semanas para ser procesadas. Por lo tanto le pedimos que inicie su trámite con la anticipación debida para que pueda solicitar, y después recibir, su visa a tiempo. Aunque el trámite puede variar de un solicitante a otro, a continuación detallamos los pasos básicos que deberá seguir, y lo que puede esperar a lo largo de todo este proceso.<br>  <br>  Para programar una cita:<br>  <br>  Desde el 15 diciembre de 2006, Ud. puede solicitar su cita a través del Internet. <br>  Dé click a continuación para accesar a este nuevo servicio: Servicio de Citas via Internet<br>  <br>  Si Ud. lo prefiere, llame para solicitar su cita para el trámite en la Embajada de E.U. como se ha venido haciendo en últimos a?os, a los teléfonos que se indican abajo.<br>  <br>  Recomendamos programar su cita con amplia anticipación a cuando Ud. piense viajar (tomando en cuenta los tiempos de espera para cita y entrega mencionados en la página inicial de visas, que la Sección de Visas cierra los días festivos, y que la demanda aumenta en los meses anteriores a la Navidad, Semana Santa, y vacaciones de verano).

(Nota: el pasaporte debe tener vigencia de por lo menos seis meses posteriores a la cita, así es que conviene que tenga vigencia de alrededor de un a?o posterior a la llamada telefónica.) Los operadores también explicarán cómo se paga la cuota por trámite del EQUIVALENTE EN PESOS de $100 dólares, no reembolsable, en cualquier sucursal de BANAMEX, y le darán la fecha y hora de su cita.<br>  <br>  Prepare su(s) solicitud(es) antes de venir.<br>  No se le permitirá el acceso si su(s) solicitud(es) no están llenadas completamente.<br>  Las solicitudes llenadas en Internet se tramitan más rápidamente y pueden reducir su tiempo de espera.<br>  <br>  Para llenar via Internet su Solicitud General de Visas<br>  Utilice la forma DS-156 <br>  <br>  <br>  Llegue a tiempo para su cita de visas en la Embajada de E.U.<br>  <br>  Unicamente se permitirá la entrada a la Sección de Visas a las personas que van a solicitar su visa. Solicitantes menores de edad (hasta los 20 a?os), ancianos ó minusvalidos podrán venir acompa?ados.<br>  <br>  Por favor tome en cuenta que no se le permitirá entrar más de 30 minutos antes de la hora de su cita, así es que tampoco tiene caso llegar con mucha anticipación a la Embajada.<br>  <br>  Tenga su pasaporte, solicitud y documentos complementarios listos para su entrevista con el/la vice cónsul.<br>  <br>  Considere que deberá esperar entre 2 y 4 horas mientras se procesa su información. <br>  <br>  Por motivos de seguridad no se permite la entrada con alimentos ni bebidas.<br>  <br>  Cuotas de Trámite de Visa<br>  <br>  Todo solicitante de visa de visitante debe pagar por el trámite una cuota no reembolsable de EL EQUIVALENTE EN PESOS de $100 dólares. Dicha cuota se paga en cualquier sucursal de BANAMEX antes de la cita.  Conserve el recibo a la mano, ya que deberá presentarlo durante el la recepción de datos y en la ventanilla de la entrevista.<br>  <br>  Todos los ciudadanos mexicanos menores de 15 de a?os que estén solicitando una visa BBBCV de turista, en el caso de que alguno de sus padres ya tenga la visa láser, BBBCV o una de entradas múltiples (legible por máquina, pegada al pasaporte) o también esté solicitando su visa BBBCV, puede pagar EL EQUIVALENTE EN PESOS de $13 dólares para solicitar una visa BBBCV que vencerá a los diez a?os o cuando el ni?o cumpla 15 a?os de edad, lo que ocurra primero. Si se paga la cuota completa (EL EQUIVALENTE EN PESOS de $100 dólares), el ni?o podrá solicitar una visa que tenga vigencia durante diez a?os.<br>  <br>  CUOTA ADICIONAL: Por favor tenga en cuenta de que como parte de su cita es posible que tenga que someterse a una revisión completa de sus huellas digitales.  Este procedimiento tiene un costo adicional de $85.00 dólares, por lo que deberá venir preparado a pagar esa cantidad en pesos, dólares o con tarjeta de crédito.<br>  <br>  Si desea más información ?en inglés? sobre las cuotas de visa, por favor visite el sitio del Departamento de Estado. <br>  <br>  Si Ud. no es mexicano y/o está solicitando una visa especializada, puede consultar las Tablas de Reciprocidad de Visas (en inglés) para ver si debe pagar alguna tarifa de expedición de visa por reciprocidad, que además dependerá de los a?os de vigencia de dicha visa. Estas tarifas se pagan en la Embajada el día de la entrevista.  Estas se pueden pagar en dólares, pesos, o con tarjeta de crédito.<br>  <br>  Categorías de Visa<br>  <br>  Los ciudadanos y residentes permanentes de México en general deben tener una visa de no inmigrante o tarjeta de cruce fronterizo (también conocida como "visa láser" o visa "BBBCV") si desean viajar a Estados Unidos. La visa BBBCV es la nueva visa para visitantes que deseen entrar a los Estados Unidos.<br>  <br>  Existen varios tipos de visas para visitantes temporales a los E.U. El tipo de visa que se requiere está definido por la Ley de Inmigración, y tiene que ver con el propósito de su viaje. Algunos tipos de visa podrán requerir una cuota de expedición por reciprocidad.<br>  <br>  Visa "BBBCV" ó "B1/B2" de Negocios y Turismo (con menores, con empleados domésticos) <br>  Visa "J" de Visitante de Intercambio <br>  Visa "F" ó "M" de Estudiante <br>  Visa "H", "L", "O" ó "P" de Trabajador Temporal <br>  Visa "I" de Periodista y Trabajador de Medios <br>  Visa "TN/TD" de profesionista dentro del TLCAN <br>  Visa "A" Diplomática y Oficial <br>  Otras visas (de cónyuge de ciudadano, asilado, etc.) ?inglés? <br>  La visa le permite a un extranjero viajar a los Estados Unidos y presentarla en el puerto de entrada al Inspector de Inmigración del Departamento de Seguridad Interna de los Estados Unidos para solicitar permiso de ingresar. Una visa no garantiza la entrada a los Estados Unidos.<br>  <br>  Después del 11 de septiembre del 2001 se realizaron cambios que involucran la amplia revisión de las prácticas de expedición de visas en lo que compete a la seguridad nacional. Todas las solicitudes son ahora sujetas a un escrutinio mucho mayor que en el pasado. Cuando dichos procedimientos resultan en la necesidad de evaluación adicional de ciertos solicitantes, se le informa a los afectados al presentar sus solicitudes. Este procedimiento tiene un costo adicional de $85.00 dólares que deben ser pagados al contado o con tarjeta de crédito. Esta es una razón más por lo que es indispensable solicitar su visa con amplia anticipación antes de su fecha de salida de viaje."<br>  saludos y suerte<br>  Israel|`|6e7bd3123c7d04bf505cc518036a5006aa	tienes   otra  oprtunidad  de ir .. utilizando el  mismo pasaporte mexicano   ..  que ya te  fue  sellado   por el  consul americano  .. <br>  y  si en  la  segunda   cita   te rechazan  de nuevo  la  solicitud de  visa  .. <br>  tienes  que   volver a  sacar  un nuevo pasaporte  mexicano  .. <br>  <br>  eso  es lo q  te  trataron decir  ..  con la segunda  oportunidad  .. <br>  y   si   ..  tienen  razon  los  que te  dicen  que  cada  rechazo que tengas  ante   la embajada  sera  mas  dificil  para  ty   ..  que te den   en  realidad la visa  .. <br>  dile adios a tus 100 dlls ... y tambien   al dinero que    pagaste   para  tu  pasaporte  mexicano   si te  lo vuelven a sellar ..|`|vWhgBgCwaa	NO, CADA VEZ QUE TE PRESENTES TE COBRAN, SI NO, DONDE ESTA EL NEGOCIO ???|`|ww0S2NANaa	Pues ya ni para que desanimarte con la mala noticia,  mejor te doy animos.  <br>  <br>  Vas a ver que si te la dan  !!!!<br>  <br>  Mucha Suerte y Saludos desde México|`|613b9c7a456d371793e679b7a9a704ffaa	si los pierdes y para que te den la otra oportunidad tienes que volver a pagar|`|qTwTIKQPaa	PODRAS SOLICITAR LA VISA CUANTAS VESES LO DESEES, SIEMPRE TENDRAS QUE PAGAR, TAMBIEN ES VERDAD QUE ENTRE MAS VESES LO SOLICITES TENDRAS MENOS PROBABILIDAD DE QUE TE LA OTORGUEN POR LO TANTO DEBES DE PLANEAR LA PROXIMA CITA DE LA EMBAJADA.

Hasta donde he leido en periódicos como El Univesal" y "Diario Monitor" así como sus versiones en linea, No se trata de una decision gubernamental sino de lo que grandes acaparadores (MASECA, uno de ellos) son los que estan especulando con el precio del maíz blanco, con el pretexto del aumento del maíz en el mercado internacional. Quien haya hecho esta pregunta "sue?a" que el Peje nos hubiese salvado de este aumento. En corto, pasó lo que pasó porque el precio del maíz dejo de estar subsidiado por el gobierno federal al entrar en vigencia la flotacion de precios firmado en el TLC. Asi que ni el Super-peje ni otro que nos haya prometido detener los aumentos, pudo haber evitado lo que se firmó hace 15 a?os.
28a8d984ec6273ca41966ccf8ac4afe9aa	Definitivamente la tortilla es la mala de la película, pero lo que have falta hacer ver a la gente es que en los centros comerciales venden la tortilla a 5.80, de muy mala calidad pero es el gancho para que la gente la compre ahí y de paso deje mas dinero, los precios se deben basar en la oferta y la demanda, estoy de acuerdo, a nosotros los tortilleros nos vendían hace un a?o la tonelada de maíz a 1900, después subió a 2100, luego a 2400 y en diciembre a 3600 y en enero a 3800, como le hacemos para mantener el precio a 8.5 con la competencia desleal que hacen las compa?ías grandes? pues nada, cobraremos el papel, la bolsa, la distribución etc. a este precio lo único que va a pasar es que el mercado se va a depurar y van a salir de él, los que no tienen economías de escala. El gobierno también debe de regular el precio en las grandes tiendas detallistas y en las peque?as, ya que un kilo de tortilla de milpa real se vende a 8 pesos, también lo deberían ajustar para evitar los monopolios y en la "tiendita de la esquina" se vende a 9 pesos el kilo, por qué carambas tenemos que tragarnos el cuento de que se va a proteger a los pobres? Si el huevo, el pollo, la carne, las verduras y en general todo ha subido y seguirá subiendo aún cuando el estandarte del gobierno cambie (pri, prd, pan, pt etc) también el libre mercado es importante y te comunico que hoy el precio de la tonelada aún no baja.|`|881a7ee0516b37496b874ea98a339d98aa	Se nesecita ser un pobre idi-ota para defender va los acaparadores y a los monopolistas.<br>  ??Ahora salen los pedorristas a defender a los que atentan en contra de los pobres.??<br>  Que imbecil eres.|`|13b41e1feffaa3d0d12e228ce422f3b4aa	Aqui no ha aumentado, ya lo dije antes, creo que esto es solo cosa del centro y ya me estoy artando que a los chilangos solo les aumentan dos pesos cualquier fregadera y se ponen a chillar.|`|9aabb2ec3b6eabf0b698604aae9c999faa	que gueva con la politica...todo esta podrido!!|`|c1e7cfa7115a3172bb27096ec898be75aa	No todos los panistas son malos, hay gente a quien le interesa este pais, yo sonosco a panistas que repudian las injusticias, asi que no barras parejo.

VHnVBZhVaa	You can usually only draw unemployment when you are terminated without fault.  Fault (or just cause depending on your state) can be found in breaking company rules, doing personal business on company time, behaving rudely to a customer/client or failure to show up to work.  Just because your employer cites a rule does not mean you cannot file, but your employer may contest.<br>  <br>  If your employer contests it will file a response stating why it had good reason to fire you and the commission will take this into account in determining if you received benefits.  If the employer contests you may want to have an attorney present at the hearing although you are not required to do so.<br>  <br>  Another factor is severance pay.  If you received a severance package from your employer it is considered income and may offset any unemployment compensation to which you are entitled.  <br>  <br>  It would probably still be worth filing but know that if your employer contests you may very well lose.  Sexually harassing a customer will violate the rules of just about every company.  If you do receive unemployment make sure you follow the regulations regarding attempts to find a new job to ensure you don't lose your benefits.|`|0k2klSFsaa	for being terminated yes at least in my state the only way to get unemployment is to be fired  you will have to fill out the paper work and see they look into the situation and decide to give it to you or not so try the worst that can happen is they say no  but they may say yes|`|7675f38114bc08dcb10becf27c34cdfbaa	yes.

Am2WeOdRaa	I'm sorry that you and your wife went thru something so horrendous.  You can do an online search to identify the "top rated" "medical malpractice" lawyers in your area.  Ask them for a consultation during which you can discuss the facts of your case and ask for how they handle cases and deal with their clients as cases progress.  <br>  <br>  On the facts you present, you might consider filing criminal charges, or at least filing a complaint with your state licensing official overseeing medical doctors.  You can contact the state bar to determine if there were prior complaints filed against any lawyers you consider hiring.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Expect about 45-50 percent of a settlement to disappear on top of expenses accrued by your lawyer for things like professional inquiries. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to get rich, then you might as well give it up, most lawyers will try to settle out of court and will take most of the settlement. <br>  If you are trying to right the wrongs done against you then, I would suggest choosing a lawyer that knows upfront you are after justice. Most lawyers will turn you away when they hear that.|`|e3434e6687214ff855f33181f242b935aa	The link below is for a site that helps in 2 ways.<br>  You can get free advice and they will help you find a Lawyer in your area who practices in malpractice suits.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your family

As dramatic as that sounds it's really quite simple.<br>  <br>  As for the rest I'll continue to support my market positions and not make any real investments until the GBH is out of office or neutered by the mid-term elections.  I'll continue to flip houses on my off time and make money off the morons that couldn't read their contracts.  Although that is also on it's way out for the moment.  Now I'll probably turn to keeping a dozen or so houses for rental properties and let the dregs that once owned them rent for slightly more than the mortgage+taxes.<br>  <br>  As for why you are a liar.  It's simple.  You have absolutely no idea how much  money someone with a 10 million dollar portfolio actually has and are actually silly enough to believe that is the bulk of their funds.  You lack the simplest understanding of the stock market and show it on a regular basis. <br>  <br>   But yes, people who are comfortable are taking less 'risk' and investing in areas that are more stable.  <br>  <br>  ADDED:<br>  <br>  *laugh*<br>  <br>  Let me make sure I have this right.

I wanted to see the world, and get a college ed.<br>  I was told by my recruiter I could do both. And I signed on. After I'd gone thru all the military schooling necessary, I looked into the college schooling next. I even made sure I was working nights in order to go to school days. Then I discovered sleep was more important than I thought. And it was hard to sleep during the daytime with a bit of noise around in the barracks. I had to shelve my hopes then for a college ed. Now I understand that they will put you in on a delayed entry, and you can get on a program where they cover school and you go into the service later. Maybe they even have a reserve program that would work for both schooling and military service. I would talk to a few recruiters and not just one in any one location.They are paid a job to recruit any way they can. I never did see the world. Not even to cross the pond. I put in for Okinawa and was turned down three times by a 1st Leiutenant who had it in for me. So there you go. Once you're in, you're in and you can't change your mind about anything. You can't leave if things disappoint you, that's for sure. You're in for the long haul. I would visit different locations for recruiters and hear what each will promise,and put it in writing! Even then, don't expect his promise to be laid in concrete. He has to rack up numbers each month, or they will send him to another MOS quick time. I know of one guy that happened to. Now  he's in Iraq with his wife for their first term. And they have to go back again, since they agreed to and got a hefty amount of money as an incentive in advance. <br>      The average soldier seems to be obligated to go to one<br>  of the two battlefronts, twice. And each time you go back,<br>  your chances of being killed or maimed for life gets higher.<br>  So think about getting an education by another means if  you<br>  can. The life you save, will be your own!<br>       A vet!|`|f36c7a7c81a74e20f0e85b49d5c4417eaa	I joined the army in 2003  as an engineer, I was hoping to accumulate at least 30 credit hrs during my 3 year enlistment. I left the military mid 2006 with 3 credit hrs, between deployments to Iraq, 60 day long field exercises, a chain of command that was unsympathetic to my cause it waspretty impossible forme to get 30 hrs. I would say it would be very difficult tfor you to achieve your goals unless you get sent to the perfect unit with very caring commanders, especially now that units are not being given the one year recovery period between deployments. There are some type of online classes that are offered to deployed soldiers in Iraq but once again it is up to your commanders discretion as to whether you get the time to take them or not.|`|8aff3273c58f79ec9f50dd00e90f9e7aaa	Been there, and ended up with 43 credits.  I was Marine for 4 years, and did a few things to get some creds along the way.  Some of my credits were from professional military courses and training.  Some were from actual college classes I took in my off time (classes are available on base; I even took some classes while deployed aboard a ship - there were instructors hired on the ship).  I also took CLEP tests, which essentially allow you to study on your own and test out of a subject.  On base, CLEP tests are free, and you can take each one once every six months, so there is no reason not to try!  I ended up saving myself most of my gen-eds and about 2 years of college this way!|`|f1BP4uZbaa	Im in the AF and I can tell you that it takes alot to get started in classes and it can be very difficult to do college if you get deployed.

You can be charged with several crimes and yes there will be ramifications.

Como gobierne cuatro a?os más reparte el país entre los nacionalistas, y le entrega Navarra a ETA. Porque ya está bien, no sé cómo hay gente que no puede ver lo del canalla terrorista que ha liberado recientemente, porque arresto domiciliario para una persona que ha matado a 25 y encima se ríe de las víctimas desde el trullo, es una burla. Como dijo el ministro de justicia anterior, antes de que lo quitaran, deberían haber usado todos los recursos legales para mantenerlo en prisión. Y a continuación pusieron a uno de los personajes más oscuros de la historia de la democracia espa?ola, Rubalcaba, que asumió públicamente la decisión de liberar al terrorista-asesino (y lo podéis consultar en El País). Porque había posibilidades de que muriera... Bien, parece que esas posibilidades no están del todo claras, pero de todas formas, ?es que alguien le prohibió a ese animal dejar de comer? Si quería morirse de hambre yo le hubiera dejado morir, un canalla menos, ya ves qué problema. No hubiese tenido narices de todas formas, porque toda esa gentuza son unos cobardes, los cobardes del tiro en la nuca y la bomba por control remoto (incluidas mujeres, ni?os y ancianos). Cobardes, porque estos no se inmolan como los árabes, por eso no hubiese sido capaz de morir de hambre.<br>  <br>  Por otra parte, ?dónde está la política del gobierno "Socialista"? Hemos visto estos días como 10 presidentes de empresas constructoras e inmobiliarias espa?olas (como el de Astroc Mediterráneo o Martinsa) han entrado en la lista de los más ricos del mundo que elabora la revista Forbes. Y de la noche a la ma?ana, estos "se?ores del ladrillo" como les llama Forbes se han hecho con patrimonios multimillonarios a costa de hipotecar a varias generaciones de espa?oles, que ya no hay quien pueda comprarse una vivienda digna. Y que eso lo permita un gobierno que se dice socialista... ?Qué vergüenza! ?Dónde están las 100.000 actuaciones en vivienda?<br>  <br>  Y, ?a qué viene ese interés por Irak? Por cierto, que parece que los 3 a?os anteriores no había guerra, ?por qué no se han hecho manifestaciones hasta el cuarto a?o? ?No será que el gobierno está contra las cuerdas y tiene que sacar los fantasmas que le llevaron al gobierno?<br>  <br>  ?Cuántos de los asesinados en Irak lo han sido a manos de soldados espa?oles? ?Cuántos lo han sido a manos de sus "compatriotas"? Por cierto, que los que asesinan son los que apoyaban a Sadam, que matan a mujeres y ni?os, y atentan incluso en mezquitas. ?Y qué hay del resto de guerras del mundo? ?A nadie le interesan las masacres que se realizan en áfrica? Millones de seres humanos... Y todos los que mueren de hambre (y esos no hacen huelga), y de sida y de otras enfermedades. ?Esos seres humanos inocentes, víctimas del sistema capitalista, no existen? Vaya izquierda consecuente. Son una vergüenza. Sólo hay guerra de Irak. Y todos, Rodríguez-PSOE y Izquierda Unida, Ezquerra, etc., todos apoyando al bueno de Fidel, que lo que hay en cuba es un régimen de democracia ejemplar...<br>  <br>  Y por si alguien no quiere votar a PP, otra opción podría ser votar al partido de la ciudadanía (el partido de ciudadanos de Catalu?a se ha hecho nacional), para al que no le guste Rajoy. Por lo menos si sacan unos esca?os, no va a pedir una parte del país al gobierno para darle apoyo parlamentario.

They were indeed dual citizens and will remain so until they are of age. Then, I believe, Germany wants them to decide which citizenship they want to retain. Laws change all the time regarding this but in general, the baby will have the citizenship of the country they were born in and that of the mothers. To know for sure I would simply contact the english embassy as well as the dept. responsible in south Africa.

HaviqgZjaa	The answer if you are in England and Wales:<br>  <br>  If you were not involved in the attack in any way, and did not encourage or assist your friend in it, then you are not guilty of any offence.  There are no offences of failure to render aid or leaving the scene of a crime in British law. <br>  <br>  Neither are you legally obliged to tell the police about it, though you may find yourself in trouble if they come to you and you lie to them when questioned.<br>  <br>  The correct thing to do is clearly to tell the police, and if things were as you say, you are not going to get in any trouble - in fact, you will probably end up as the main witness for the prosecution.  Your friend may of course then try to blame you for the attack, and there is always the risk the police or the judge might believe his version of events rather than yours...but there is still no doubt what the right thing to do is. <br>  <br>  I would strongly suggest you go see a criminal defence solicitor.  They will not tell the police about any of this unless and until you agree, and will be there to support and advise you when you (hopefully) make the right decision and go to the police.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	Was the punch an outright assault or was your friend defending himself??<br>  If an assault the first thing you do is disown this so called friend. Then there is leaving the scene of a crime, not least as a decent person would administer first aid to the chap who was assaulted.<br>  You say the man died, well if you dont realise this is bloody serious you must be stupid. My personal standards may not be equal to yours but i would contact the police forget your "friend" where is his loyalty to you???<br>  Tell the police everything otherwise you are becoming enmeshed in a hell of a lot of trouble. If you wait til the police find you, you will be an accomplice to a manslaughter charge and will be held in jail til the police get to the bottom of it.

In word and deed you agreed  to the act of violence . what you should have done if innocent was to see if the victim was injured then called for assistance. That you clearly did not do and the fact that you did not call for assistance meant that the victim that may have been saved with early treatment died from lack of it.

However, if your parents are out of town or something, they should be able to call the school and explain the situation, and let the school know that you are a temporary emergency contact.  I have a younger brother and my mom used to ask me to stay with him when she would go out of town on business, and I never had any problem signing him out of school or anything if he was ever sick.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Those are two different questions. <br>  <br>  You can legally sign papers as soon as you are old enough to hold the pen. "Most" sorts of legal agreements you might enter into, however, will not be enforceable until you are 18. (There are a 'few' exceptions)<br>  <br>  To sign papers for a minor, you must not just be an adult, you must be their legal guardian. Even your 70 year old grandad isn't 'old enough' if he's not your guardian.<br>  <br>  Richard|`|V1GKJh8zaa	You've already got the correct answer. You have to be a legal guardian for siblings or others for your signature to be legal.<br>  <br>  Again... already correct answer for the first part of your question. In the US, the legal signing age is 18 for any personal documents.

AA10707498	DMRC is a govt based organization but professionally managed.  The advantages of not letting politicians meddle with any activities are there  for everyone to see. For all the tom-toming by our Railway Minister about Indian railways being profitable, time will say what jugglery was adopted by the accountants to make it appear so. Basically everything boils down to the leadership of any organization - he should be professional with loyalty only to the task on hand and he should be apolitical. Watch the difference with such leaders at the top (other example is the Election commission - look at what a good leader like TN Seshan did to the organization) Good leader also ensures that he leaves a legacy for the future leaders to follow or take off from where they are (not letting the achievements die along with their end of their career/tenure)|`|0WLSvVY5aa	DMRC has money and liberty and foriegn hand.<br>  Govt. based organisations have low money, less liberty and internal hands only.

rttm1SLaaa	Isn't it interesting how they're still arguing for lower taxes for corportions, despite the fact that, not only has it not functioned well today, but past examples show that it is accompanied by a bubble-burst effect.  We start doing reasonably well, and then after a period we get a recession.  A Democrat takes over the office, gets us out of the recession with so-called "spending," and then Republicans retake office before the effects of that "spending" can take place and provide the government with a major influx of money.  Jobs are created, and then the taxes on them are reduced, making it impossible to recover the costs of making those jobs, and thus leading to a higher deficit and debt.  Isn't that amazing?    Edit: Al B seems to have no concept of history.

It is Barack and his advisers that are pretending to know what will and will not work to fix the economy.    Case in point, they plan on pretending that doing what FDR did is both new and effective. This, of course, leads to the quote from FDR's Treasury Secretary:    "We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and if I am wrong ... somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosperous. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises ... I say after eight years of this Administration we have just as much unemployment as when we started ...

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	Malvo testimony<br>  In John Allen Muhammad's May 2006 trial in Montgomery County, Maryland, Lee Boyd Malvo took the stand and confessed to a more detailed version of the pair's plans. Malvo, after extensive psychological counseling, admitted that he was lying at the earlier Virginia trial where he had admitted to being the triggerman for every shooting. Malvo claimed that he had said this in order to protect John Allen Muhammad from a potential death sentence, and because it was more difficult to obtain the death penalty for a minor. Malvo said that he wanted to do what little he could for the families of the victims by letting the full story be told. In his two days of testimony, Malvo outlined many very detailed aspects of all the shootings.<br>  <br>  Part of his testimony concerned John Allen Muhammad's complete multiphase plan. His plan consisted of three phases in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas. Phase one consisted of meticulously planning, mapping, and practicing their locations around the D.C. area. This way after each shooting they would be able to quickly leave the area on a predetermined path, and move on to the next location. John Allen Muhammad's goal in Phase One was to kill 6 people a day for 30 days. Malvo went on to describe how Phase One did not go as planned due to heavy traffic and the lack of a clear shot and/or getaway at different locations.<br>  <br>  Phase Two was meant to be moved up to Baltimore. Malvo described how this phase was close to being implemented, but never was carried out. Phase Two was intended to begin by killing a pregnant woman by shooting her in the stomach. The next step would have been to shoot and kill a Baltimore police officer. Then, at the officer's funeral, they were to create several improvised explosive devices complete with shrapnel. These explosives were intended to kill a large number of police, since many police would attend another officer's funeral.<br>  <br>  The last phase was to take place very shortly after, if not during, Phase Two. The third phase was to extort several million dollars from the United States government. This money would be used to finance a larger plan. The plan was to travel north into Canada. Along the way they would stop in YMCAs and orphanages recruiting other impressionable young boys with no parents or guidance. John Allen Muhammad thought he could act as their father figure as he did with Lee Boyd Malvo. Once he recruited a large number of young boys and made his way up to Canada, he would begin their training. Malvo described how John Allen Muhammad intended to train all these boys with weapons and stealth, as he had been taught. Finally, after their training was complete, John Allen Muhammad would send them out across the United States to carry out mass shootings in many different cities, just as he had done in Washington and Baltimore. These attacks would be coordinated, and were intended to send the country into chaos.|`|PWvS7vqPaa	On 17 November 2003, the father, John Allen Muhammad, was found guilty in Virginia of four counts of murder, two of which he was sentenced to death for.<br>  <br>  On 30 May 2006, he was also found guilty on six counts of murder and sentenced to 6 consecutive life terms without parole.<br>  <br>  On 10 March 2004, the son, Lee Boyd Malvo, was formally sentenced to life without parole for one count of murder.<br>  <br>  On October 26 2004, he entered a plea deal in the murder of another victim to avoid the death penalty.|`|2rcSILkWaa	Father got death penalty.<br>  <br>  Son got life in prison.|`|rXUAUmt9aa	They were both paroled in December and have now formed a Las Vegas singing act, "Crosshair 101".

It's not supposed to be for people who merely want to milk the government for all they can (training and benefits) and get out. To retire with benefits, one has to (or at least 25 years ago had to) be in for 20 years. Retirement age is 55. So, to be an officer, one had to be no more than 34. <br>  <br>  A man or woman could conceivably join the military at any age. However, they'd have to compete physically and mentally with people less than half their age. Because of the health risks (we old fogies are expected to break more easily than young kids), and the liability (the military doesn't want to be sued because some old coot died doing the first push-up of fifty in Boot Camp).<br>  <br>  "Couldn't allowances be made for age?" Yep. But then why have requirements at all? If a guy has to run an obstacle course with a 160-pound guy on his back to be combat ready, why, just because he's older, should the requirement be lessened? If the guy has to carry his buddy off the field, the buddy isn't going to lose 120 pounds just so the old guy can carry him.<br>  <br>  When OIF began, I went down to a recruiter and offered my services. seems that there's something wrong with my birth certificate... says I'm too old. I run (not jog -- between 7 and 9 minutes/mile depending on the heat and terrain) 10-15 miles a week (weather permitting). I work out three days a week with weights. I work out three days a week with a Kali instructor. I do cardio two or three times a week. I swim between two and five miles a day. I'm 6'2" and weigh 185. My resting pulse is 52.

I wonder what your opinion of the Iraq war is, because we've already spent far more in there than we're planning on spending here, and that was OFF BUDGET, which means we have no idea where the money went.  Meanwhile, this plan is the most transparent in the history of this country - there'll be a website detailing waht each penny was spent on, and the entire text is available to the public, as are multiple news sources and their summaries on the plan.  25 billion is meant to help us more.  Yes, it's more spending.  I know that's scary, considering how little spending happened during the Bush administration that wasn't helping anyone *shudder*.     Edit: so your big response is to say that spending more just worsens the problem?  The issue isn't spending, it's how things are spent.  I went into that in depth at the end of my answer, but I'll elaborate again.  The stimulus is going to create jobs, which will cause an influx of money into the economy.  Bush's spending ended up being a massive money dump on the Iraq War and banks with little to no gain for us.  Spending can help, it just has to be focused in a better way.|`|c1566a746196b29f9589775543f6928caa	I think they are drunk with power now.

Not one ever balanced a budget, not one did not run up a massive deficit, the last running up more than $12 TRILLION and leaving us an economy in shambles. You did that!    Where do Republicans come off now telling us how fiscally conservative they are when the last president to leave a surplus was a Democrat!    We need to get this economy going and all Republicans have done is be partisan and obstructive! You now say you have a better plan, which is nothing more than more tax-cuts for the rich!     We tried your "plan" for 8 years, and before for 20 years before that. Trickle down isn't new. It did not work under Reagan either and is primarily the hemmorhage that got us into this hole under Bush.     Tax-cuts for the wealthy which was borrowed money, is idiocy. Talk about dumb! The economy starts at the BOTTOM not at the top!!! Is that a concept too hard for Republicans to grasp?    We didn't fund the "Bridge to Nowhere" and we didn't fund the "Road to Nowhere", which is built. As far as the former, Palin just kept the money and didn't build the bridge!    ______________________________________    "Cantcu: Please dont tell me you think that Clinton left a surplus. Please research your info. Because he did NOT."      Really?      Clinton presided over the longest period of peace-time economic expansion in American history, which included a balanced budget and a reported federal surplus.Based on Congressional accounting rules, at the end of his presidency Clinton reported a surplus of $559 billion. wiki    http://www.gpoaccess.gov/USbudget/fy09/h...    The GAO is where these figures came from. Clinton DID actually leave a budget surplus, unless you want to argue with the Government Accounting Office!    2000  2,025,  4571,  789,216  (236,241(Surplus))|`|9FI7zaKraa	a billion here, a billion there.....soon your talking about a trillion....now your talking about real money. these elitist are proving they do not have a clue about the economy or how to handle other peoples money. kick em all out..|`|7mOfekBWaa	Unless you have an idea on how to get things done without money, I suggest you quit your right wing rant and focus on the job at hand. How do you expect the 12 trillion dollar deficit to be alleviated if some money is not spent in the process? Unless you can build bridges out of spit and air, we'll have to spend money to make money.|`|DY9NOh4taa	Of course they are, that is the same game that they played with former President Bush, adding things to bills or they would not be passed. People blamed Bush, when he wouldn't raise taxes to pay for these pork barrel programs of the Democrats.  However, that extra money will start disappearing from our checks a week after the bill is approved.   People wanted to ridicule Former President Bush, when all he was doing was looking out for those whom had voted for him, and had placed their trust in him as Commander in Chief.  Obama is going to do what Obama wants to do, and he is going to butt heads with the House and Senate, and if he refuses to play ball with them, it will be a long and lonely 4 years for Obama at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  The other reason for the extra money may be that the Democrats have gotten the first heating bill and seen that Obama is keeping the thermostat above 80 degrees, because he claims he is used to the weather in Hawaii.  Either way the 25 million will be added or Obama will hear from the the ranking members of the House and Senate, and told to get on board or forget about getting his programs through either the House or the Senate.  The war in Iraq, and the insurgency in Afghanistan, neither one have anything to do with this bill, people would like to  think so, but these are economic stimulus packages, that have nothing to do with foreign affairs.  It is the Democrats making the bill larger than it has to be, while on the same hand they are laying the blame on Former President Bush, when in fact, he had nothing to do with Obama loosing 15% on his approval rating after one week, it was the nonsense we had to put up with over Obama's cabinet picks, of which there were questions about their taxes.

They served on a board together - a board that was started by a REPUBLICAN, actually a Republican friend of Ronald Reagan. For all of you hicks who dont know what a board is -- it's a group of people in the community who meet one a month (or less) to discuss the business of whatever foundation has asked them to serve. Being board members doesnt mean you hang out outside of the required meetings, nor do members have the power to say who they will and wont serve with...<br>  <br>  And Obama didnt launch his career in Ayres' living room. Obama merely attended a party for Alice Waters, which was thrown at Ayres' home in Chicago. Obama was on Alice's invitation list. At that time Ayres and Obama had never met.<br>  <br>  So suck on that.<br>  <br>  And also -- the beauty of a DEMOCRACY is that the people of our country pick our leaders, not a bureaucrat at the FBI. And the people of our country are picking Obama, so deal with it.|`|HLdG74ttaa	The whole thing is insane. What it boils down to, after some research, is that they are barely even connected, and even if you want to assume they are "connected" and he IS a terrorist (Ayers), then you have to realize that McCain also had relations with him.<br>  <br>  When it comes time to vote, if you are stupid enough to be swayed by such attacks on a candidate, launched (obviously) by his rival, then you shouldn't even be voting. Period.

Your relative is terribly misinformed.<br>  <br>  "Senator Obama strongly condemns the violent actions of the Weathermen group, as he does all acts of violence.

E' un fenomeno che coinvolge non solo la cultura politica, ma anche la conoscienza, e di conseguenza la coscienza che è ancora più importante, della globalità dell'individuo.<br>  La maleducazione che permette ad individui come Sgarbi di trovare qualcuno che lo ascolti, l'arroganza dei genitori che a scuola non prendono neppure in considerazione che il proprio figlio possa davvero essere un "ciuccio" (ciuco in dialetto fondano) e minacciano i professori, urlare le proprie opinioni anzichè parlarne, l'egoismo, sono tutte facce della stessa medaglia: la povertà intellettiva e morale così diffusa.<br>  Ammettere di poter sbagliare comporta due sforzi molto grandi:<br>  - informarsi sul serio, per avere ragone da vendere<br>  - dover eventualmente ammettere di aver fondato la propria vita su cose sbagliate<br>  Quindi molto meglio rimanere nella propria beata ignoranza.<br>  E' nostro dovere fare giustizia, che non vuol dire prendere a schiaffi questa gente, anche se la tentazione è forte, ma rispondere all'offesa con la calma, all'ignoranza con l'informazione, e seminare pian piano il nostro orticello, non fatto di persone schierate con noi ma di persone che abbiano imparato ad usare il cervello.<br>  Mai arrendersi. Perchè fra questi ignoranti c'è invece chi il cervello ce l'ha e lo usa per tirare i fili di queste inconsapevoli marionette.|`|wXSKSwwvaa	Beh che Berlusconi dal 90 ad oggi abbia "conosciuto" 780 diversi magistrati è un dato di fatto che fa capire chiaramente che la magistratura, almeno in parte, è in mano alla sx. <br>  <br>  Il recente caso Forleo è la conferma: venerata fino a quando ha messo sotto inchiesta agenti della CIA e del Sismi per sequestro di persona ( il capo terrorista Abou Omar), è diventata l' oggetto di critiche, ingiurie, diffamazioni, processi disciplinari, per aver fatto a D' Alema, Veltroni e Fassino nel caso UNIPOL quello che altri magistrati regolarmente fanno impunemente ( e per me giustamente ) nei confronti di Berlusconi. <br>  <br>  Oltre a quello mi viene in mente un certo Dossier Mitrokin dove per farlo insabbiare si è ricorso anche all' omicidio del testimone ex spia del KGB che doveva confermare i finanziamenti sovietici ai comunisti per fomentare la rivoluzione comunista<br>  <br>  Cmq diciamocelo... Berlusconi si ta parando il pòpò con le nuove leggi ad personam ma nn possiamo accusarlo di più di quella sx che negli anni 90 cercò con mani pulite di far piazza pulita della concorrenza. <br>  Infatti nn ricordo un solo indagato di sx e credo che chiunque abbia senno, sia esso a dx o a sx, possa credere che il marcio era da una sola parte<br>  <br>  Cmq che si voglia farlo passare per santo o per nn colpevole perchè nn condannato in sentenza definitiva... facile togliere leggi che ti farebbero fare almeno 10 anni di galera e poi dire " sono stato assolto perchè il fatto nn costituisce reato"<br>  <br>  <br>  Dai su nn pigliamoci in giro...<br>  <br>  <br>  Per Di Pietro... ha avuto il mio voto al senato. <br>  Spero se lo meriti. <br>  <br>  Per la mercedes dico che è uno specchietto per le allodole usato contro di lui proprio perchè lui usa molto la querela e la denuncia. <br>  <br>  Insomma una vendetta trasversale|`|050bc90c3e269f82fe2ed7b1a800eb3baa	Ho quarant'anni qualche acciacco troppe guerre sulle spalle <br>  Troppo schifo per poter dimenticare <br>  Ho vissuto il terrorismo stragi rosse stragi nere <br>  Aereoplani esplosi in volo e le bombe sopra i treni <br>  <br>  Ho visto gladiatori sorridere in diretta <br>  i pestaggi dei nazisti e della nuova destra <br>  Ho visto bombe di stato scoppiare nelle piazze <br>  E anarchici distratti cadere giù dalle finestre <br>  <br>  Ma ho un armadio pieno d'oro di tangenti e di mazzette <br>  Di armi e munizioni di scheletri e di schifezze <br>  Ho una casa piena d'odio, di correnti e di fazioni <br>  Di politici corrotti, i miei amici son pancioni, <br>  <br>  Puttanieri, faccendieri e tragattini <br>  Sono gobbi e son mafiosi massoni piduisti e celerini. <br>  <br>  Ho quarant'anni spesi male fra tangenti e corruzioni <br>  Ho comprato ministri faccendieri e giornalisti <br>  Ho venduto il mio di dietro ad un amico americano <br>  E adesso cerco un'anima anche di seconda mano <br>  <br>  Ma ho un armadio pieno d'oro... <br>  <br>  Ho quarant'anni ed un passato non proprio edificante <br>  Ho massacrato Borsellino e tutti gli altri <br>  Ho protetto trafficanti e figli di puttana <br>  E ho comprato voti a colpi di lupara <br>  <br>  Ma ho scoperto l'altro giorno guardandomi allo specchio <br>  Di essere ridotta ad uno straccio <br>  Questo male irreversibile mi ha tutta divorata <br>  è un male da garofano e da scudo crociato <br>  <br>  Ma ho un armadio pieno d'oro.<br>  <br>  MODENA CITY RAMBLERS - 40 ANNI (O 73, FA LO STESSO).|`|2c8fSx4saa	completamente|`|Dsf8Z9sWaa	D'accordissimo con te!

Possiamo sperare, ora, in una..revisione delle coscienze per non sprofondare definitivamente nel buio?<br>  <br>  Pubblico la lettera  inviata da Antonio Di Pietro a B. Grillo:<br>  <br>  “Caro Beppe,<br>  ci sono momenti nella vita delle nazioni in cui i cittadini devono fare delle scelte. Momenti in cui non si può più fare finta di niente e continuare a credere che, in fondo, nulla veramente cambierà. Le leggi che continuamente vengono proposte dal nuovo Governo sono un attentato alla democrazia. Se passano, vincerà il regime e perderà, per un tempo indefinito, la democrazia. Non c’è bisogno dell’esercito per togliere la libertà ai cittadini. E’ sufficiente manipolare l’informazione e, grazie a questa, farsi eleggere in Parlamento. Quindi legiferare contro la Costituzione, contro l’indipendenza della magistratura, contro la sicurezza dei cittadini, contro la libera informazione. Una legge dopo l’altra.<br>  <br>  Cosa distingue un primo ministro di una democrazia da un dittatore? Il vero tratto distintivo è l’impunità assoluta del dittatore. <br>  <br>  Quando Silvio Berlusconi l’avrà ottenuta l’Italia sarà, a tutti gli effetti, una dittatura. <br>  Sorprende come opinionisti autorevoli abbiano potuto accreditare Silvio Berlusconi di qualità di statista e come una parte della stessa opposizione abbia creduto di poter avviare con lui le riforme istituzionali. <br>  <br>  La storia di Berlusconi parla per lui. <br>  <br>  I suoi innumerevoli processi, la condanna per corruzione giudiziaria del suo avvocato Cesare Previti per la Mondadori, la sua appartenenza alla P2, l’occupazione abusiva delle frequenze di Rete4. <br>  <br>  L’elenco è interminabile come i danni subiti a causa sua dal nostro Paese. <br>  <br>  Mi riferisco soprattutto allo spegnersi della coscienza civica, della morale, dell’etica. <br>  All’esempio devastante che Berlusconi ha offerto alla nazione e alle giovani generazioni in quasi venti anni, un esempio aggravato dalla sua impunità. <br>  Una situazione simile a quella dei ragazzi nei paesi del Sud che ammirano il camorrista o il mafioso locale.<br>  <br>  Il Consiglio dei ministri di oggi, 27 giugno 2008, ha approvato il DDL per garantire l’impunità alle prime cariche dello Stato durante l’esercizio del loro mandato, che diventano quindi più uguali degli altri cittadini di fronte alla legge. Nelle scorse settimane sono state presentate dal Governo leggi che definire vergogna è insufficiente. E’ più corretto chiamarle eversive e criminali in quanto minano le basi dello Stato e favoriscono i delinquenti.<br>  <br>  La sospensione dei processi per un anno serve a evitare la possibile condanna di Berlusconi al processo Mills di Milano. Altri centomila processi saranno bloccati per reati che vanno dallo stupro, alla truffa, al rapimento di minore.<br>  <br>   La sicurezza dei cittadini, tanto sbandierata in campagna elettorale da Berlusconi e dalla Lega, è sacrificata all’interesse del presidente del Consiglio. <br>  <br>  Il divieto di pubblicare le intercettazioni una volta depositate in tribunale a disposizione delle parti, e quindi di fatto già pubbliche, impedirebbe di venire a sapere di Parmalat o dei furbetti del quartierino.<br>  <br>   Il giornalista che pubblicasse le intercettazioni finirebbe in carcere, il suo editore chiuderebbe e chi ha compiuto il crimine non dovrebbe rispondere all’opinione pubblica. <br>  <br>  Con questa legge, negli Stati Uniti non ci sarebbe stato il Watergate e Nixon non avrebbe rassegnato le dimissioni. <br>  <br>  L’Italia dei Valori proporrà un grappolo di referendum per l’abrogazione di queste leggi contro la democrazia, se necessario promuoverà azioni di disobbedienza civile come la pubblicazione degli atti giudiziari. Nessuno può più rimanere a guardare.<br>  L’otto luglio a Roma dalle ore 18:00 in Piazza Navona, in contemporanea con l’iter di approvazione della legge sulle intercettazioni, l’Italia dei Valori insieme a esponenti della società civile ha indetto una manifestazione per la libertà di espressione e per la giustizia.” Antonio Di Pietro<br>  <br>  E' forse questo l'uomo che vuole il bene del proprio Paese e dei suoi cittadini?<br>  <a href="http://www.uonna.it/evasione-fiscale-cancellata-berlusca-paga-spiccioli.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uonna.it/evasione-fiscale-can...</a><br>  .|`|rW2LsldQaa	Purtroppo i mezzi di informazione controllati dal capo del governo non sono pochi. E le sue "veline" impazzano da anni ormai. Basta ascoltare i suoi sottoposti parlare in tv per capire che son tutti "educati e coordinati" a dire le stesse cose, di solito bla bla bla senza capo nè coda, ma che fanno molta presa su un certo tipo di target.<br>  <br>  In ogni caso grazie a Dio esistono un sacco di persone, anche qui presenti, che non lasceranno passare certe idee senza provare ad alzare la propria voce.<br>  <br>  Come dice il proverbio "le bugie hanno le gambe corte" ed aggiungo io, a volte anche i bugiardi!

However Obama is no better. He has lied and is a hypocrite. HE only denounced his racist church when he decided to run for president then and cut off his friendship with his pastor that he revered to as a "father figure and mentor" You don't attend a church for 20 years and then claim you didn't know the radical racist opinions of your pastor.

On Tuesday McCain said that he is against the bailout of AIG and would not allow it. On Wednesday after its approval McCain said it had to be done. Then Thursday morning McCain received a phone call from Obama offering to make a joint statement about the crisis on their common principals. McCain didn't return that call until 2:30 in the afternoon. At 2:35 McCain gave a press conference to annouce that he directed his campaign to contact the Obama campaign to make a joint statement on the economy and that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington and lead the passing of the bailout bill. He attempted to undercut Obama by making the joint statement appear to be is idea, unaware that the Obama campiagn had already distributed an email to the media about there intentions shortly after the phone call. McCain went to Washington when a tentative deal had been reached for passage of the bill. McCain met with his republican house members and an hour later the deal was busted. McCain and Obama were then invited to the White House to discuss the bailout. It was reported that McCain was noticeably quiet and that Obama asked questions and made comments to the Treasury secretary.<br>  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  <br>  McCain accused Obama of "phoning in" his leadership and said that he would not do that as a leader. Yet, we now learn that in fact what he did was go to Washington after the debate and got on the phone the whole weekend. He told us he met face to face with republicans. <br>  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/magazine..." rel="nofollow">http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/29/magazine...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.factcheck.org/elections-2008/...</a><br>  <br>  Palin Goes Against McCain In Bringing Up Wright<br>  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06/palin-goes-against-mccain_n_132187.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Katie Couric Talks Palin Interview: "We Gave Her A Lot Of Opportunities"<br>  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06/katie-couric-talks-palin_n_132302.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06...</a><br>  <br>  McCain's Erratic Health Strategy: Now He's Slashing Medicare<br>  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/mccains-erratic-health-st_b_132242.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/m...</a>|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	He also voted for the sellout bill!

Lo volete capire che la gente non crede più ai falsi profeti? Cosa hanno fatto Travaglio e Grillo per l'Italia? Come potrebbero migliorare la condizione di vita di ognuno di noi? La gente ha fatto una scelta. Sarebbe bello poter dire: 'Grillo e Travaglio sono due persone oneste, le voto! Che ci governino loro'. Ma non è così. Queste due persone sono lungi dal candidarsi, proprio perchè incapaci di agire. Riescono solo a parlare, dire, insultare. Ma niente fatti. Niente di niente.<br>  La gente vuole qualcuno che la governi, che le dia speranza, che ne risolva i problemi, che agisca. E ha scelto Berlusconi perchè gli altri erano impresentabili.<br>  Grillo e Travaglio stanno facendo montagne di soldi sulle vostre spalle. E' solo speculaizone commerciale.

E lor odiventano sempre più ricchi.<br>  Chi è che deve aprire gli occhi?|`|F6CSxiibaa	In tutto il suo discorso Grillo ha sollevato i suoi due principali temi:<br>  1. Non pagare il canone televisivo<br>  2. Fare un referendum "produttivo" per abolire il canone<br>  <br>  1. Il canone televisivo è un'imposta per la detenzione di apparati atti o adattabili alla ricezione delle trasmissioni radiotelevisive. <br>  Il Ministero delle Finanze concede alla RAI la gestione dello Sportello abbonamenti TV, che riscuote il canone.<br>  La Corte di cassazione ha chiarito la natura del canone, che "non trova la sua ragione nell'esistenza di uno specifico rapporto contrattuale che leghi il contribuente, da un lato, e l'Ente Rai, che gestisce il servizio pubblico radiotelevisivo, dall'altro, ma costituisce una prestazione tributaria, fondata sulla legge, non commisurata alla possibilità effettiva di usufruire del servizio de quo".<br>  <br>  2. In Italia il referendum è di norma abrogativo (per eliminare una legge in vigore) o, più di rado, consultivo (per sentire il parere del popolo, che comunque non è vincolante).<br>  Per fare un referendum "produttivo" (propositivo forse?) sarebbe necessario prima cambiare la legge italiana!<br>  <br>  <br>  Per almeno questi motivi Grillo propone delle soluzioni sciocche, che causerebbe più danni che altro: nessuno potrebbe più avere la TV abilitata a ricevere trasmissioni! <br>  Non si potrebbe vedere la TV! <br>  Che idea geniale, non è vero?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Il problema infatti non è nel canone ma nella qualità del servizio televisivo. Lo hai scritto anche tu.<br>  Quindi, invece di dire baggianate e urlare provocazioni insulse, Grillo potrebbe concentrarsi sulla risoluzione effettiva del problema, che non risiede nel canone ma nella qualità del servizio.<br>  Potrebbe fare delle proposte attuabili per apportare migliorie, invece si ostina a stuzzicare chi lo ascolta con soluzioni fuori dal mondo.<br>  Serve concretezza per risolvere i problemi, non sciocche provocazioni!|`|U6IaTn77aa	Concordo in pieno|`|nc4iK3COaa	Concordo|`|DvreEMSYaa	beppe grillo dovrebbe stare solo zitto preferisco pagare il canone rai ke un suo spettacolo a 50 euro!!<br>  ma non ve nè rendete conto ke sta facendo tanto casino per nulla??a lui non gli interessa nulla di come sta la gente...gli interessa solo i miliardi ke ha in banca!!e più gente lo ascolta più gente gli darà soldi!!!ma lo sapete chele firme del 25 aprile raccolte da lui non sono valide???non possono essere presentate al governo per problemi di burocrazia si potevano raccogliere firme solo dal 3 maggio in poi per poterkle presentare...quindi ha fatto tanto casino per nulla...!!!|`|K85yIeCgaa	vuol dire che se li magnamo!!<br>  ragazzi,ragazze,io me ne vado in australia...|`|Th83t79jaa	<a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LhOJc1JBpKI" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LhOJc1JBpK...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=mTfgtYg1_3A" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=mTfgtYg1_3...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=MW8iP38KiGc" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=MW8iP38KiG...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlydL2UAlQ" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=_tlydL2UAl...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=JMbr_gKDWx8" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=JMbr_gKDWx...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJin-dYraY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=iXJin-dYra...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=eoue61XDw6k&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=eoue61XDw6...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LmuGJ18pksg&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=LmuGJ18pks...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=ghnId460NLg&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=ghnId460NL...</a><br>  <a href="http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=n-u4dOGSgf4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://it.youtube.com/watch?v=n-u4dOGSgf...</a>|`|Y6Cza3ycaa	melanio8 tu hai ragione nel dire che trà libri e spettacoli loro prendono soldi,però non credo che loro non vogliono candidarsi,è che i politici in generale sia di destra che di sinistra nessuno li candida,perchè anche se sembra un pò esagerata loro purtroppo dicono la verità,che sia tipo comica o scritta,ma sempre verità è,ciao|`|e0c64c58b17237900f9af7bc4e7556bbaa	Cosa vuol Dire le Fragole sono <Mature??|`|rDaMDEI4aa	concordiamo tutti, a me sinceramente quando mi sono accorto che ciò che dice ha delle prove evidenti, con i fatti degli ultimi giorni è corso un brivido per la schiena, ma davvero.....ho pensato. cavoli. in parlamento il pd applaude il pdl e i "comunisti" non esistono più, fatti fuori dall'informazione di regime, tutto combacia, sono due comitati d'affari.|`|rvvN8aOHaa	le fragole sono mature l'aveva detto in un vecchio spettacolo... comunque ha ragione, tra quelle firme c'è anche la mia! difendiamo la democrazia!!!!

Il mio non è qualunquismo, è una seria analisi della situazione. Noi abbiamo almeno 4 priorità<br>  1) Giustizia troppo lenta. La Giustizia è un formidabile motore economico e un collante sociale.<br>  2) Meritocrazia nella pubblica amministrazione e, in generale, nella società italiana. Deve cominciare lo Stato fissando criteri oggettivi, anche se imperfetti (li miglioreremo strada facendo), e licenziando chi non li rispetta o premiando chi lavora.<br>  3) Scuola e Ricerca. Senza queste siamo completamente incapaci di concorrere su mercati mondiali. Migliorare i docenti, ma fare capire ai ragazzi che bisogna studiare altrimenti si viene bocciati! Finanziare la ricerca non sulla base delle cordate di aziende o gruppi baronali, ma sulla base della validità del progetto, monitorando negli anni quanto l'investimento ha reso.<br>  4) Controllo dell'immigrazione. Perchè nessuno dice che l'immigrazione serve agli industriali per tenere basso il costo del lavoro? Perchè nessuno dice che mentre i nostri concorrenti attirano immigrazione con alto livello di istruzione noi facciamo il contrario? Perchè nessuno dice che è una nuova forma di colonialismo dove noi assorbiamo energie a paesi che ne avrebbero bisogno<br>  5) L'età pensionabile va agganciata da subito all'aspettativa di vita. Lancio una proposta: non si può andare in pensione se non si hanno i 5/6 dell'aspettativa di vita e se non si hanno contributi per almeno metà. Alle donne con figli viene riconosciuto un bonus per ogni figlio, ma solo a loro. Si costruisca infine un sistema di protezione che paghi i contributi nei periodi in cui non si ha lavoro, a patto che non si rinunci a quelli che vengono offerti nel raggio di 50 km.|`|odjgpClzaa	Fin'ora abbiamo visto una marea di persone, di tutte le età, che si rivolgono a maghi e fattucchiere vari per chiedere se troveranno lavoro, se guariranno dalla malattia che le affligge, se  saranno ricambiate in amore e come sarà il loro destino e se vinceranno al lotto.

La lettera, in mano agli inquirenti, costrinse Mills ad ammettere di essere stato corrotto dal nanetto in cambio della sua falsa testimonianza, salvo poi ritrattare su insistente invito dello stesso "signor B".|`|MWsiBAXbaa	Ma smettetela, tutti ad attaccarlo , poverino!<br>  Che volete che sia qualche leggina salva fondoschiena.<br>  E poi se anche viene fuori qualche criminale da galera non è poi la fine del mondo! <br>  é anche del lavoro straordinario per gli avvocati ( categoria a lui prediletta ), anche loro devono pur mangiare.|`|CWfObsk0aa	no|`|Up7P8y9Maa	sì... si tratta di una legge che sospende per la durata di 12 mesi i processi per reati il cui momento di commesso delitto si collochi anteriormente al 30 giugno 2002 e la cui pena edittale massima sia inferiore ad anni 10 di reclusione...|`|pl66LArqaa	Non sono una fan di Berlusconi (io voto Lega, non dire che è la stessa cosa xchè non lo è, mi sento rappresentata da questo partito e la voterei anche se si presentasse da sola), non sono però neanche una fan di Travaglio perchè, secondo me, dice, come si dice dalle mie parti, "quello che gli avanza"...esempio pratico: nel libro "Se li conosci li eviti" (ne ho letto un paio di passi, non tutto) parla di Roberto Maroni e della condanna per "resistenza a pubblico ufficiale", non dice però che quella "resistenza" era legittima (è finito anche in ospedale grazie a un paio di manganellate) perchè gli agenti non avrebbero dovuto perquisire il suo ufficio.

Fino ad oggi, siamo stati cortesemente ignorati.<br>  Per questo invitiamo tutti i cittadini sprovvisti di televisore, ma in possesso di altri apparecchi multimediali (computer, decoder, etc.) per i quali hanno ricevuto una richiesta di pagamento da parte della Rai a proporre un interpello all'Agenzia delle Entrate. Contrariamente ad altre forme di richiesta, se l'interpello non riceve risposta, il contribuente può far valere la sua interpretazione della legge, senza incorrere in future sanzioni.

Only in your dreams.  lol|`|Nfzt6j1laa	nope...<br>  There will always be those that refuse to see people for who they are and not from what they appear to be...<br>  African Americans will always be considered by some people as gangsters or slaves, Arabs and Muslims will always be terrorists, Asians will always be geeks... <br>  stereotyping is very wrong, it really prevents development. after all, we all share the same world, we should learn to get along and respect each others views...<br>  <br>  im just happy that George Bush's reign is finally over!|`|uuz4sK4Waa	I hope so, although I supported Obama, I do have to point out that voting for McCain doesnt automatically make you a racist, but I do have to question the intelligence for anybody who'd vote for a ticket with sara palin on it...that pig is dumber than Lou Ferrigno...|`|7ui3pQtiaa	I doubt it.  We still have Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev.

They need to start helping people of all races.|`|SVYI25Jlaa	No.  It may help, but unfortunately a lot of people, rather they admit it or not, are racist, and many of them will pass it down to the next generation.|`|ge1C7alfaa	Look at the racial makeup of the prison population in America and then try and tell me racism is a thing of the past.|`|NmGPTdgvaa	Of course not...but it's a huge step in the right direction...things like this don't happen overnight...but I honestly think we are a about one generation away from really having equality for all in this country...|`|BoXx0yK5aa	Nope. People will always use the race card and will always try to play the victim.<br>  <br>  Sad.|`|KSXjmaJ6aa	the deck never had a race card and if it did then it was played by McCain when he used Obama full name or the media |`|1L00QTMHaa	Not likely. People who didn't vote for Obama are being called racist every day.|`|0Rwsg8IVaa	It might help, but I don't think that it will make much of a difference for radically racist people|`|AA11955763	they will most likely think of some other thing to pull against the whites.|`|3h9zGIY3aa	I don't think that will ever happen as long as there is more than one race...|`|PJcu82zUaa	Yes, Carlos Mencia Said So!|`|M6JTr5Seaa	hopefully|`|YeXwPEcuaa	i wish but i agree that it will still be here as long as there are different races...|`|Ukt3s5Uqaa	yay! no more blaming "the man"<br>  <br>  interesting times- who/what will be the next scapegoat?<br>  |`|JkGgWfmiaa	Well no more excuses for us.....Whats holding us back the man..... Not really because we BECAME the man.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	This question keeps being asked. I hope it does. Bc this white girl is tired of some blacks giving her attitude bc "theyre black and shes white".|`|SaxjkMbSaa	You must be kidding ?<br>  <br>  It will be played now more than ever<br>  <br>  Obama is now in a win/win situation<br>  <br>  If Obama fails to solve or Economic Problems & International Security Problems......you will not be allowed to criticze his failures because it is not politically correct to criticize a Black President the way you do White Presidents<br>  <br>  If Obama succeeds......he will be heralded as an outstanding  Black Politician .....not just a Good President|`|ITF52tu9aa	So electing Obama has now erased racism? <br>  <br>  The civil rights movement occurred in my lifetime. White only restaurants and water fountains also existed in my lifetime. <br>  <br>  Racism is more hidden now. But it still there. Imagine if the recent media reports about violent white supremacists and the kookie McCain supported beating herself up- imagine if the perpetrators of these events were black. Ohhh, the rage... the generalizations. <br>  <br>  Imagine if Limbaugh's and Hannity's hate speech came from blacks. The outrage would be incredible... it's funny what we seem to overlook and what gets magnified. <br>   <br>  Overcoming racism will take much time and courage- much more than someone who is tired of the issue deciding it is over. Yet this is a HUGE step in the right direction. |`|OIQvZ87gaa	That will never happen...the black population was raised on it, nurtured and taught that the White Man is bad...What do you think is going to change that over night? |`|Ic1u6INRaa	people will always have their opinions regardless of who's president.|`|aJ0MZ7osaa	no it will always be there. just not as prominent

t79pLOCUaa	I used to consider Wilson and Heath the worst since the war.<br>  Now Blaire has go to the top of my list o the worst.. He was a real con-man. Won 3 general elections and left the country in the worst condition since the last Labour government in the 70s.<br>  Anyway Blaire makes Wilson look a model of probity.|`|VfYvJypEaa	Neither , they both destroyed the country .|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	B Liar has to be top of the worst PM tables.<br>  <br>  Wilson may have been a wily old crook but at least he didn't take us to war in Iraq!  Wilson's most famous remark (after his currency dvaluation) was "The pound in your pocket is still worth a pound".  <br>  <br>  Like now under Gormless Gordon Clown and his inept useless puppet Darling:-  <br>  We still have a pound in our pocket it's just that all our imports have now gone up 25-35%.    <br>  Spin has been around a long time before B Liar used the word!|`|DQpPRg9caa	Harold Wilson kept us out of Vietnam where as Blair involved us in Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  <br>  Definitely Harold Wilson.|`|fyhl3TQgaa	Tony Benn, would've made a great PM. But, as there have only been six Labour  PMs, there isn't much to choose from. In my opinion the greatest PM of the UK, of any party, is Gladstone.|`|yb4FbFiSaa	Attlee beats those two hands down.  I can't think of a singe redeeming feature of either Blair or Wilson.|`|y0Vxs86Iaa	Wilson, hands down.<br>  <br>  Despite Blair having far more charisma, at least Harold Wilson had the sense (and guts) to stand up to the US and refuse to involve Britain in a fairly unnecessary war. Despite veiled threats from Lyndon.B.Johnson to flood money markets with stored British currency from WWII and thus devalue the Pound (the same threat that was given by Eisenhower over the Suez Crisis a decade earlier) unless British troops were brought into Vietnam, Wilson stood firm. Even with this strong stance, excellent relations remained with the US.<br>  <br>  His reform of censorship laws, capital punishment, divorce, abortion and a whole host of other social issues was very much in keeping with the changing times bringing the country out of the dour and lean 1950's overhang.<br>  <br>  However, I must agree that Clement Attlee is by far the best Labour PM, if not the best of the 20th century. Overall, Attlee has to be in the top three with Pitt the Younger and Gladstone.|`|D6YjGzEAaa	Wilson was much better. His government built social housing, taxed the rich, abolished hanging, vastly extended the universities system, ensured workers had rights and kept Britain the hell out of Vietnam to name but a few progressive policies. Wilson actually had socially democratic "principles". I don't think Tony Blair even knows the meaning of the word.|`|yGqzk4UAaa	I think Harold was more devious than Tony in terms of his pipe and mac makeover: His adopting a Northern accent and courting the Beatles was gross.  But I would still place him above Tony - who  partied with Oasis at number ten - after taming and butchering the Labour Party into something middle England could vote for and the right wing tabloid press could endorse.
ZY95NCzJaa	There is not one instance of a government run program anywhere on Earth that functions as efficiently as a private business would.  Private industry actually has to show a profit and produce or else they will fail.  Government agencies just take more money an deficit spend when they fall short.  For example, UPS and Fedex are efficient and show a profit whereas the US Postal Service lost 6 billion dollars in 2008.|`|5M0FBU89aa	This goes against what all you folks are saying, but hear me out.  When you say "Government", are you talking Federal, State, Local, Community?    I think the recent economic meltdown proved that there is a "critical mass" upon which non-governmental companies potentially become corrupted with vast consequences.    The middle-ground is  governance on a local level, and that would mean EVERYONE'S involvement on a daily level - you got time for that?    The amazing thing is that government works as well as it does...    It wasn't the government that caused our economic crisis; it was poor management in large *private*  companies with world-wide/national interests that we put too much trust in. (FannyMae and FreddyMac all the way down to  Dean Whittier)    Count the number of private jets in the Private versus the public sector... Sure, there's a bunch of corrupt public officials, but you can bet there's better oversight in Government than in the private sector... Why do I say that??? There are literally THOUSANDS of groups - local to multi-national, from CNN to the ASPCA that minitor government performance....  That is what the Freedom of Information Act was all about.    How many groups are there that monitor private businesses?   It's ILLEGAL to monitor a private business for anyone to monitor a private business on the same level that anyone can monitor a public service-organization.|`|AA10187742	No|`|R0NdLzynaa	Can't happen.

You won, congrats, don't you have better things to do?<br>  <br>  I am already sitting down, I will not shut up.<br>  <br>  Yep, we had our chance.|`|d5qb8fjBaa	You can't blame the republicans for all of that - both parties are in the government - it is BOTH parties fault.

Oggi dare la colpa di questo sfacelo ai soli baroni è da irresponsabili.

Così come la possibile privatizzazione delle stesse.

AA11966821	Most foreign nurses end up working as nurses aides when they get to the US because they cannot qualify to take the board exams, or cannot pass them.  Some cannot even pass the exams for certified nurses aides!<br>  <br>  You would need to have your education assessed by a professional who can compare different countries' education systems.  You also have to find out how to qualify to take the board exams in the state in which you want to settle (each state is different).  You might also need to be a legal permanent resident to take the state boards.  That would mean a year or so after you immigrate before you fully qualify and get your state license.<br>  <br>  It's a nightmare.  And do beware "placement services" hiring foreign nurses on employment visas -- these are the ones ending up as non-certified nurses aides at $7/hour because they can't pass the boards and get their licenses.  You cannot possibly survive in the US on such low pay.

28ea2fc06015a7e0096a3636fabb769daa	caro Michele<br>  io credo e spero che la maggior parte dei giovani siano come te, la rappresentaza su questo sito non deve per forza essere quella nazionale<br>  la gioventù dovrebbe portare idee nuove, creatività apertura mentale e capacità di recepire posizioni diverse<br>  poi con il tempo molti prendono la strada della convenzionalità<br>  è semplice, conveniente<br>  si perchè riteniamo sinonimo di convenzionale=naturale<br>  non è così, naturale è tutto ciò che riguarda la natura, quindi tutti i comportamenti possibili, riguardando l' uomo, che è un essere naturale, sono naturali<br>  convenzionale è ciò che noi riteniamo sia giusto<br>  ma questa sensazione del 'giusto' è data dalla società in cui siamo immersi, non solo dal luogo geografico (e sai che già i comportamenti variano dal centro di una grossa città alla sua periferia) ma anche dal tempo (solo 20 anni fa ad esempio i neri in sudafrica non potevano votare pur essendo il 90% della popolazione; qui in Italia 50 anni fa, e guarda che è un tempo breve se ci pensi, sarebbe stato assurdo vedere una donna in tv o al mare con un costume 2 pezzi).<br>  L' Uomo è portato a creare un 'gruppo' da difendere e da cui essere difeso, in cui identificarsi, in cui riconoscersi.per non perdersi.<br>  In realtà, la Realtà è un fluido che si modella attorno a noi e a cui possiamo dare tutte le forme che vogliamo.<br>  Il nostro pensiero la cristallizza, la rende rigida e perciò immutabile e fragile, e spezzarla determina una crisi nell' individuo.<br>  Per questo i giovani sono sempre una speranza, perchè in loro la realtà non si è ancora fissata del tutto, ha ancora un grado di mobilità....<br>  per questo mi rattrista vedere tanti giovani avere già le idee fisse imposte dalla società in cui sono immersi, in cui già sono affogati....<br>  tu chiediti sempre una cosa nella vita per cercare di vedere tra le crepe del muro della cultura dominante....chi ci guadagna?...vedrai che rispondendo a questa domanda scoprirai la verità...<br>  non accontentarti delle soluzioni facili che ti propongono<br>  cerca di valutare il peso di ciò che ti dicono<br>  studia le lingue......(su internet puoi farlo facilmente vai su un sito in cui c'è uno scambio linguistico come sharedtalk, vai su bbc.com sulla sezione lerning english) sono importantisse: primo ti permettono di accedere a un maggiore numero di informazioni (qui in Italia l' informazione è totalmente adulterata, sai venendo al tuo discorso, è facile fare apparire i rumeni dei mostri: un fatto di cronaca nera viene messo come prima notizia per giorni, su tutte le rubriche di approfondimento etc.. , pr carità i fatti sono anche gravi, ma la cronaca nera deve essere secondaria in un tg nazionale, invece si parla di quello per evitare di parlare di altro...sei forse troppo giovane, ma ad esempio Vespa ha parlato per decine di volte del' assasinio di Cogne, mamma uccide bimbo, ne avvengono decine in Italia ogni anno, ma nello stesso momento previt, braccio destro i berlusconi, veniva condannato per avere pagato la più grande tangende di tutti i tempi di tutta europa...e di quello manco 5 minuti in una delle centinaia di puntate di porta a porta)<br>  le lingue ti servono inoltre per aprire le tue capacità percettive, vei, la lingua è un limete alla nostra capacità di coscienza, ciò che non può essere detto non può essere immaginato; se conosci altre lingue capisci più cose<br>  infine le diverse culture ti portano tanta ricchezza, tanto sapere, tanta conoscienza...altrimenti finisci che per tutta la vita giri per le stesse 10 vie vedendo la stessa gente invecchiare negli anni assieme alle loro idee già ereditate vecchie<br>  insomma il consiglio è: passa il tuo tempo su internet su un altro sito.... hehehehe...me fa ridere scrivertelo ma non è una battuta...vai su sharedtalk.com e passa le tue serate li a parlare con gente di tutto il mondo che vuole amare..e non odiare...<br>  ciaoooo|`|239e3d14f4705a82ec292dc3a59d5148aa	ti compatisco solo perche' affermi di avere 15 anni mentre non  compatisco il fatto che dici (parlano senza sapere)<br>  ma che cavolo sai tu, sei forse andato in giro per il mondo per una vita come me?

La scelta di Berlusconi/sindacati è stata forse ottimale per il lavoratori di Malpensa e Alitalia nel breve periodo (e dico forse perchè, comunque, pur restando italiana, dubito che si possa salvare senza i tagli al personale di cui parli; anzi dubito che si possa salvare e basta). Ma i lavoratori comunque non sono solo quelli di Malpensa e della linea aerea. Gli stipedi elargiti da una società altamente inefficiente quale Alitalia (se hai volato con un certo numero di compagnie aeree e tra queste figura l'Alitalia non avrai problemi a notare come il servizio offerto sia qualitativamente inferiore rispetto agli altri) sono pagati da altri lavoratori.

Crime, anti social behaviour, cars being stolen and arson.<br>  <br>  The people who cause the least trouble seem to be anybody who doesn't fall into this category<br>  <br>  As for the Polish, well I have a few Polish friends, my partner is not a UK citizen either. Anyway, he got up and went to work in the same place with those Polish guys for wages that most of the lazy work shy losers round here would not get out of bed for.<br>  <br>  The only people I see causing trouble in my neck of the woods are white, lazy foul mannered Brits. <br>  <br>  I have been sexually assaulted before. It was by one man. Now if I concluded that because of my experience that all men are animals, then I would probably go through life jaded and unhappy.<br>  <br>  The difference between you and me is that despite my personal experiences  I do not assume that because one dog has bitten me, that all dogs always bite. <br>  <br>  That is an ignorant and naive conclusion to say the least.<br>  <br>  Not all people are bad, and bad people come in all kinds of shapes and sizes<br>  <br>  Also<br>  <br>  I think you need to get some help and support, sexual assault is a terrible and terrifying  thing to go through.<br>  <br>  You should not have backed down in pressing charges- even if the police have let you down, it's very important. Whatever the consequences, another woman has now suffered the same fate as you- and that is on your conscience. <br>  <br>  Yes it's easy to be angry...I know how that feels and you want somebody to blame. So you blame the system and generally damn all migrant workers. Only one person did this to you- not many..just one man, and you backed down and let him win. You can't  blame every other migrant worker for that fact. <br>  <br>  What if somebody is raped?...or god forbid murdered by this person?. Could you live with knowing that something you could have done may have helped stop that? The more complaints that are filed the more seriously it will be taken.  I think you need to go back and complain again...he sounds like a dangerous individual who needs to be detained. <br>  <br>  my heart goes out to you...and I sincerely wish you the strength to recover from your terrible  ordeal<br>  <br>  Seph<br>  x|`|HvXW7EEwaa	it was recognised by European politicians in the 1970s that British people would never give up their sovereignty to the concept of one power in Europe. they concluded that the only way to make it possible would be to water down the indigenous population with mass immigration. and demoralise the indigenous people completely by removing their culture and de valuing  their nationality. this was a discussion about the possibility of turning Britain into Europes industrial Island containing all of its main nuclear power stations taking away the expensive safety culture surrounding nuclear power and industry at the time.....we have already been sold into the EU with out a referendum. and the labour party is not only filling our country with immigrants from all over the world. but it has spent the last eleven years destroying our culture to the point that at one! time, they even tried to make our national flag illegal. i believe that what is happening now. is the EU's slow and deliberate destruction of our country aided and abetted by all three main political parties in Britain. when this happens MPs from Britain will have riches and power beyond their wildest dreams and will of course! be completely unaccountable to the people.|`|NyQjxmydaa	If there is an answer to this problem, it needs to come through the ballot box, stop voting in left winged labour candidates or so far right that they get up your nose conservatives the BNP are a self destruct group, so try the UKIP party see if they can extract us from this sh-te hole called Europe and then repatriate or deport all these unneeded foreigners, just cherry pick who we need as for your experience, don't forget it or let it fester learn and get stronger from it, take up rounder's, the bats always handy, and don't expect to much help from the likes of mr Jefferson|`|pbpMH3ZGaa	My thoughts are with you entirely, I think a weak as p#ss govt bowing to human rights B.S. artists, give them what they want and that will keep them quite attitude, and we brits have to look on knowing its all wrong and cant do sod all about it|`|w07L4GvIaa	 It is not only in Britain that immigrants are gods. in India i have seen <br>   kids in good schools worshiping any white man they see. <br>   i think people want to make foreigners happy , comfortable etc,etc.<br>   so that they think the country is wonder full .  <br>   its crazy but cannot be helped . <br>  |`|ydBATo8qaa	It's the work of the Satanic globalists who are working to create a One World Dictatorship.

NO! i blame the government and the EU, they are the ones who decided that everyone except the born and bred brits deserve special treatment.<br>  <br>  Personally, i think british people just get walked all over, and thats purely because we dont ever stand up for ourselves.

He was a chief of police, and consulted with a British company called Janes, anyway he was going to train some law enforcement officials and upon arrival at the airport, he was searched I mean thoroughly searched, and he was hassled in the street. So when he arrived at Janes he brought it up to some of the other higher law enforcement officials there in Britain and that's what he basically said, they have had alot of issues of racism and etc., and they purposely do not target immigrants for fear of law suits and etc.<br>  <br>  I think sexual harassment should be addressed no matter WHO is involved, so I think your advisors were in the wrong when they assumed you were being racist when you first complained. I would have sued my employer had nothing been done.

tM5MdSDPaa	The decision isn't your parents, its yours. You're an adult now. If they can't handle that, or the choices you make as an adult, then thats there problem.<br>  <br>  I have the same situation with my family. Only they WANT me to join the Navy. Speficially, they want me to be a cook in the Navy for 20 years. Not going to happen. They weren't even satisfied when I told them I was considering the Coast Guard. It has to be thier way or the highway with them. So screw'em.<br>  <br>  My advice to you, if you really want to work your way up to the nurse corps would be to study your little a** off for the ASVAB. The higher your score, the more job, and education opportunities will be made available to you. And trust me, you need high scores to be considered for most medical jobs. Also if you have any college credit, tell your recruiter. It'll earn you advanced rank when you enlist.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Well, as a member of the Navy, you aren't going to be kicking down doors in Mosul. For some, the military is the greatest thing that ever happend to them. Others just seem to never adapt to the structure and discipline. In my experience, it is what you make of it. Boot camp in the Navy for enlisted females isn't exactly Paris Island but getting yourself in shape is definitely a good idea. The better condition you are in, the less stressful it will be.<br>  <br>  When I told my parents I was joining the Marines, my Dad laughed (former enlisted Marine, USAF pilot) and my Mother asked if I was crazy.<br>  <br>  When I earned my commission, my Father pinned my bars on me and as a retired USAF Major, gave me my first oath. When I graduated flight school, both were there. When I came back from my first deployment, both were there.<br>  <br>  This is a big decision that only YOU can make. Don't let others make it for you. If you want to join the Navy, then join the Navy. Get yourself into shape. Research on line. Talk to your recruiter. Find out as much as possible about what you want to do, where the schools are, etc. Have a back up goal. If nothing else interests you, then you bettr be prepared to do whatever is necessary to reach your goal. Otherwise, you might end up serving mashed potatoes at some station. Too many focus on when they will get leave, who came come visit them, etc. Forget all that. When you join, the Navy owns you. You go where they tell you, when they tell you, and what the rules are. If you have a bofriend, kiss him goodbye and tell him good luck in life. You will meet so many new people it won't even be funny. For the first year or 2, you won't have time for a personal life.<br>  <br>  Keep you eye focused on a goal, don't let anyone or anything distract you. Good luck.|`|ugWaptu2aa	I understand how difficult it is for you to convince your parents that joining the military would be good for your future. My parents cried and nearly disowned me for wanting to join the Marines. Understand that your parents don't want to see their child hurt and no caring parent can ever prepare themselves for the realization that their child wants to leave "the nest"<br>  <br>  I commend you for wanting to join our services, especially during these troubled times. I recommend that you, your parents and your recruiter sit down and discuss your opportunities with the Navy. <br>  Parents usually feel more comfortable when their child is more informed about the benefits and consequences of joining the military. <br>  <br>  But if they are not understanding and don't approve, remember that it is your decision and not theirs. They did their part in raising you, now it is up to you to finish what they started. <br>  <br>  With that said, NURSE CORPS.... unless you have a nursing degree or a bachelor's degree to become an officer you will NOT be considered for Nurse corps. Nurses are officers in the US Navy, and it sounds like you are being led into joining as enlisted. You can be a Corpsman (which is like a Paramedic) and the Navy can and will pay for your tution, but you need to find the time to go to school. <br>  <br>  Do your own independent research before you sign up, it is very glamorous to hear that the Navy will take care of you but don't fall victim to misinformation. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|pZAFvA9iaa	You are a legal adult. Go  ahead and enlist. They will be happy when they see the finished product; you a successful nurse and a brave American soldier.|`|TQ7vHEwIaa	Follow your heart.|`|AaUS6wqtaa	I let my parents influence my decision to join the armed forces for way to long before joining.  If you give in to there wishes, you will regret it years later.  Join now, get out on your own,  see the world and grow up in a way that most people our age are too afraid  to do.<br>  <br>  Years later you will be glad you did it, you will be proud to have served your country and while everyone around you is still paying their college debt, you will be debt free, driving the car of your choice with a US Navy emblem on your back window to let everyone know, you did your part.<br>  <br>  Go join, your parents may be mad at first, but they WILL understand and one day, when the see how much the military made you grow up. They will be proud you joined.|`|opbZlSJTaa	Its your life. If its what your heart wants and if you truly want to do it. Enlist. I think its a GREAT decision. I, and alot of people in America. will support you. |`|4650bc5207b817328dce2fe5a442dad8aa	My kid is looking at the Navy too. His dream is to get an NROTC scholarship to college but he also sees benefits in enlisting and going for an officer status later. I have no problem with his potential to join any of the services. He even thinks he might take the marine option after two years of NROTC.  I am a Navy vet. My brother is and my brother-in-law and my Dad was along with many cousins. All survived boot camp and I actually survived OCS which for a naive country boy at the time - was something - I thought. (If I can do it anybody can). <br>  <br>   Boot camp is a learning experience. It is also a quick lesson in discipline and teamwork. Then you are off to schools and then to the fleet or some shore base. Only about 20 pct (or less) of sailors are actually at sea at any given time. Some never get to sea at all. My brother enlisted - became a corpsman (medic) and worked in hospitals in the USA the whole time. After 4 years he got out but stayed in the reserves. <br>  <br>  Over 40 years he advanced in the medical service corps to Captain - although his civilian job was accountant oriented. (he never went to sea)  Doctors, Nurses and administrators are in the Medical Service Corps. Corpsmen can be assigned to the "Fleet Marines" and become medics for them - they wear marine gear while deployed but their dress uniform is navy. I can't say enough about the good things that service can do for you.  <br>  <br>  The "danger" of military service is probably on par with many civilian occupations but the broadening experience is invaluable in later life. Combat dedicated specialties are certainly more risky but the odds are still good because of the very high level of professionalism in today's services.<br>  Just now - at this point in time - given the economy - Joining the military is probably a very good way to work through the next four years. <br>  <br>  I will add - at EVERY navy facility there are now computers and libraries with more online access than you can imagine. You can look at some ship organization websites and see how they stay in touch. In addition to that - online college courses are encouraged.  Some of the bigger facilities and bigger ships even have college courses taught on board!<br>  <br>  BTW - I only served 4 years - and got out. I was an officer on a TIN CAN -- a "Fast Frigate".|`|AA10246634	You won't be able to force your parents to support you. But given time they may. I can only recommend being open with them. And invite them to boot camp graduation and even to visit you wherever you get stationed.<br>  <br>  Good luck with you decision because ultimately it is yours to make.|`|VPnCk2Muaa	If you want to go that bad, then just go. Your parents are just worried about you. It's a classic case of parents not realizing their child is growing up. A lot of people can make a good career in the military, though it is tough to get a job is you are honorably or dishonorably discharged, but even tougher get used to the civilian life again.

eTSvhZTFaa	It really depends upon the fire academy. I've been a FF for 25 yrs. Went to Sarasota Fire Academy in FL. was pretty strengent back then. Had to hold a 90% average, and if you fail 2 tests you were out. Contact your local fire department and they may be able to get some academy contact info for you. Usually the academy will give you a list of requirements. When you get them, start working on them long before you enter. <br>  <br>  Good luck, it has been a very rewarding 25 yrs for me. Will be retiring this April|`|gVOHY7I6aa	WOW hoppy that was awhile ago I live near Sarasota.<br>  I thought they closed it down and the only place is in Orlando.<br>  You can now be trained at the fire house.<br>  For instance if you go to a community college and get your EMT and then you can be trained at the firehouse.

AA11724685	At the risk of sounding cliche, I really think that you know in your heart of hearts what you should do. This sounds like an environment that no one should have to live in. If you are afraid that filing charges will result in bad feelings between you and your mom, make an effort to get your own place. Tell her you need to be independant and work things out the best you can, and that you know if you really need her help that she will be there for you. This way, you get your own space and a healthy environment, and are still on good terms with your mom. I know, after something like this, even though people might think you would hate your mom for doing this, you still love her, and you always will. She's your mom. But, at this point, getting your own apartment might be a good idea for you to live a healthy lifestyle and stay on good terms.<br>  <br>  Like I said, you know in your heart what the best decision is. Good luck.  Keep your head up. Learn from her mistakes. :o)

Instead of taking this approach, may I suggest focusing on the potential legal penalities:  Paint a picture of the following life:    1. no driver's license for a year  2. community serive hours - 8hrs a weekend for a year  3. victim impact panel (MADD)   4. fine of about $750  5. Legal fees (for a decent defense) of about $5000  6. a criminal conviction that shows up on background checks  7.

While working in the bar scene for most of my adult life we saw all kinds of dumb***es try to drive home. Usually it's only a matter of time before something terrible happens. Some are just able to escape longer. If you're old enough try hanging out and the bar sober and just watch. We would stop people offer to pay for the cab and they would still literally run out the door and drive off! Naturally we turned them in. If you're not old enough you might have to call a local tavern and as some questions, bouncers are usually the ones to ask first. I think you will have do your own research about this, I doubt there are stats on the web but you never know.

There are exceptions if you need a translator, are under 18, are handicapped, etc., or if this is a confidential hearing, but I suspect none of them apply to you.<br>  <br>  There will most likely be many other matters on calendar that day so you will probably have to wait pateintly until your case is called.  <br>  <br>  If this is an arraignment, the judge will recite the charges against you and you will be asked to enter a plea.  If you plead 'guilty' or 'no contest' the case will be pretty much over and the only think left to do will be sentencing.  This may amount to an opportunity to explain yourself to the judge, but you would really only be asing for leniency in your sentencing, but don't rely on hopes that the judge will be lenient.  If you plead 'not guilty,' you will then have further opportunities to be heard at later dates, including trial.  You may also ask the judge for a continuance to retain an attorney.  If this is a different type of hearing what you should expect may be different.  If by "LPO" you mean the arresting officer, it is likely he/she would be there if this were a bail hearing or other hearing at which evidence will be given.  I'm not familiar with Michigan procedures, but in my state the arresting officer is generally not present at an arraignment.<br>  <br>  *This entry is not intended to constitute legal advice or to create an attorney-client, fiduciary, or other legal relationship.

I would make law enforcement officers that forces/coerces/extorts testimony out of wives against their husbands instead of using the evidence and/or arresting those professionals required by law to report for her, all accountable. Complete with public hearings just like how they force the wives to do it for them publically while damaged, in civil courts instead of them doing rescues etc. I'd make the crisis line workers these victims routinly get referred to report every serious complaint on to the police like any decent citizen would do, instead of just waiting and listening until the women convert to the crisis lines philosophy/theology is. And then they usually just send the victims to re-education classes instead of sending the the Police! Talk about putting it all on the victim. The professionals supposedly helping are the real ones who treat the victims like they're stupid for staying with the abuser. As if most traditional religions do not expect it of her? As if law enforcment is not duly authoritzed to arrest these guys? As if we do not already have laws requiring doctors, therapists, Pyschologists, Pastors, Priests, and Rabbis all to report known or suspected abuse. And to document it. But using all that, or holding those people accountable when they don't bother to report is too much trouble to go to for married people. I'd have judicial investigations of those Prosecutors offices that let law enforcment just ignore laws protecting these kinds of victims and the children involved. And I'd also have then investigate the "domestic violence advocates" who do nothing of the kind but instead cover up for whole sections of kinds of abusers by using what they are doing to force people instead to convert by neglecting to help them. It's criminal, and I'd make it stop. |`|a4ce2f8b4db7d0c17a5ba6d93d36836daa	A government fund providing comprehensive legal fees for all areas of law so that access to justice was on par with access to medical care.<br>  <br>  But it will never happen.|`|HpGTkrjLaa	I'd change the national game from football to rugby and make the teams switch stadiums.|`|911f168b7fa0b89caa5732f8b9174286aa	the  huge population growth.|`|UTAGu9Gyaa	Have harsher consequences for those that abuse animals!!!!!|`|V5dadGVkaa	if i could change one thing i would not let prop 8 pass the polls|`|xVgYZpQkaa	No taxes for people whose monthly income is below $2000|`|Zp1OnX8Zaa	they would invent money trees, and id get one and plant it|`|1E5l12mpaa	the government!|`|tmRns9LMaa	Tougher police enforcement!!!!|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	The present senile UK government|`|fZgoUty4aa	everything free for all

Active duty is best because in reserve and guard you can only earn 50 points each year for retirement except for active duty. A point is a day so it takes 365 points to make a year at 2.5% of highest base pay per year in retirement. You may have to start in reserves and then try to get on active duty. I was a reserve on active duty for 21 years and retired at 42. The reserve retirement starts after age 60.<br>  <br>  ASVAB score range is 140 to 240 (200 is the average). When you receive your test results, you will also receive the book Military Careers, which describes most of the positions available in the military, along with job requirements and a graph that shows your chance of acceptance based on the Military Careers Score. For example, your chances of qualifying for a certain job are 80 percent if you have a Military Careers Score of 210, but only 10 percent if you score 170 or lower.<br>  <br>  If you're serious about joining the military, then get serious about the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB).<br>  <br>  The ASVAB is a timed multi-aptitude test, which is given at over 14,000 schools and Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) nationwide and is developed and maintained by the Department of Defense. <br>  Start now by taking our practice ASVAB tests. These tests will give you an idea of how you'll score, and identify areas that need improvement. Then use our suggested resources and ASVAB study guides to learn how to prepare for the ASVAB test.|`|16c41c715d9627672fef851a33d95417aa	The Air Force is a great branch.  It is connected to the Army as the Marines are to the Navy.  Pretty much the Air wing of the Army, filling in as support.  Most jobs in the Air Foirce are non-combatant jobs although you still must qualify with the M16.  Basic training is 6 weeks long, the shortest for all the branches.  They are not very physical and stress mental strength over physical.  If you don't follow an order properly you won't be dropping to do push-ups but instead they will take a slip of paper from you that you keep in your breast pocket (of which you two on you at all times)  Get one taken away and you get disciplined by your T.I.  more than one in a week, disciplined by the Commander and probably sent back two weeks.  But 6 weeks goes by fast.<br>  <br>  As far as the ASVAB, it is the entry test to see if you qualify for military service and also determines your strengths and weaknesses in a given field, such as Math, Technical, Mechanical, Verbal, etc.  This is given at the recruiter's office or at the MEPS center where you will get your physical examination.
16c41c715d9627672fef851a33d95417aa	The University you attend will play a part as well as your GPA and major.  The Navy is very technical-based so a major in technology, such as yours or engineering is welcoming.

AA10464818	The government is NOT in the business of giving away free money for the sake of giving away money. There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal. Only those that they feel exemplifies the objective of the grant will be approved.<br>  <br>  You can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) <a href="http://www.cfda.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.cfda.gov</a> and Grants.gov <a href="http://www.grants.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.grants.gov</a> - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants.

Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant#20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program.

For example, a candidate who wins 40% of a state's vote in the primary election will win 40% of that state's delegates; however, a candidate must win at least 15% of the primary vote, or they win no delegates. If a candidate wins 14% of the primary election, they receive zero delegates. There is no process to win superdelegates, since they can vote for whomever they please. A candidate needs to win a simple majority of total delegates to earn the Democratic nomination. [1]

But that's when I was in.<br>  <br>  I enlisted with a BA in Math at age 20 in 1960. When it came time for me to extend for my E-6, somebody dusted off my degree and recommended OCS.

With the education, my military experience and recent security clearance, I got a job managing all the government contracts on the West Coast for a management consulting firm. Retired from that job 12 years later and am now living in a Veterans Home. <br>  <br>  Bad news is that I'm going to bet that, being an HM, they're going to want you to stay HM.

For some reason that is an important part of Navy Boot camp.  <br>  <br>  As a Fleet Marine Corpsman, I believe you have to attend an additional school.  Its basically a mini Marine Corps boot camp.

7qxqkjNhaa	With the "don't ask don't tell policy" they will not ask what kind of sexual experiences you had prior to joining the military. If asked if you had anal sex tell them you don't want to talk about it. |`|9rhmeb7raa	A bit of history seems in order. When AIDS first appeared in the San Francisco Bay area it was dubbed "Gay Bowel Disease" by doctors treating the malady. That's because one of the key symptoms was the presence of hemorrhagic striations in the anal canal. All of the victims at that time were anal-receptive homosexual males. <br>  So, it is possible that such striations might appear at your physical. Although the old "bend over and spread your cheeks" maneuver is designed to detect the presence of hemorrhoids or an anal fistula, it could also reveal the presence of hemorrhagic striations as well. In such a case, questions would be raised. |`|t8SucbqFaa	Remember the military policy, don't ask don't tell.<br>  <br>  Unless they find something wrong you should have no problem. My husband was in the military for 4 years and we did know a few gay people in the military. We never cared cause our opinion has always been that it's their life and they should be happy. They didn't go and publicize it around the base so everything was fine. <br>  <br>  It's going to be hard on you being in the Marines. Some people are close minded and they will make your life hard.

Its in Great Lakes so you will propably get the snow and cold weather during Corps School.... Corps School is as long as you make it. Mines was 5 months.

I dont know about your drill weekend because I am active duty. Advancement is good for reservists though. You will go in as an E-3 but in bootcamp, EVERYBODY gets E-1 base pay, and if you have dependants then you get additional pay. But when u graduate you wear your E-3 rank. Any other questions? Why did you mention a C school? Were you offered one? You usually  dont get one until you finish A school.

The majority of Air Force deployments are usually 6 months in duration.  My son, an Army Captain, is currently stationed in Iraq.

HUfkS4jBaa	I'm actually quite glad that it did not pass. Why steal money from the average American taxpayer to basically give these irresponsible banks a slap on the wrist and let them get back to the same crap they were doing before they failed? In my opinion, that is a ludicrous alternative to just letting the banks fail. <br>  <br>  Now, if they were to come up with an alternative source of money, (the CEOs of these banks' pocketbooks) I would be behind it, as it would be a stepping stone to a more permanent solution. These CEOs should be held accountable for what they allowed to happen, not count on their buddies in Washington to cover them.

Lets face it, thats kinda what politics is all about, Ill scratch your back if you scratch mine. Looks like McCain, or Palin for that matter, doesnt like to scratch backs. Also, im not sure how diplomatic a leader can be when he cant even look at his opposition in the face. Check out the debate, McCain never looked at Obama. If I were the leader of another country, i would view that as weakness or maybe you have something to hide. Also, McCain thrashed Obama for being young, inexperienced, being a celebrity, and pulling the race card. But then he chooses Palin to run with him?? A woman younger than Obama, has little/no experience outside of Alaska, has become a bigger celeb than Obama and McCain put together, and is constantly throwing the "gender" card in the mix with the whole soccer mom crap among other things. Im sorry, as much as Id like to see a woman running the country, I just dont think Palin is the right woman.

The tax credit covers 30 percent of the costs of switching one or more traditional petroleum pumps to E85, which is an 85 percent ethanol/15 percent gasoline blend.<br>  <br>  -After a number of inmates on death row were found innocent, Senator Obama worked with law enforcement officials to require the videotaping of interrogations and confessions in all capital cases.<br>  <br>  -His first law was passed with Republican Tom Coburn, a measure to rebuild trust in government by allowing every American to go online and see how and where every dime of their tax dollars is spent.<br>  <br>  -Obama created the Illinois Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families in 2000 and successfully sponsored a measure to make the credit permanent in 2003. The law offered about $105 million in tax relief over three years.<br>  <br>  -Obama joined forces with former U.S. Sen. Paul Simon (D-IL) to pass the toughest campaign finance law in Illinois history. The legislation banned the personal use of campaign money by Illinois legislators and banned gifts from lobbyists. Before the law was passed, one organization ranked Illinois worst among 50 states for its campaign finance regulations.<br>  <br>  -As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, Senator Obama has fought to help Illinois veterans get the disability pay they were promised, while working to prepare the VA for the return of the thousands of veterans who will need care after Iraq and Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  -He traveled to Russia with Republican Dick Lugar to begin a new generation of non-proliferation efforts designed to find and secure deadly weapons around the world.<br>  <br>  -Obama has been a leading advocate for protecting the right to vote, helping to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act and leading the opposition against discriminatory barriers to voting.<br>  <br>  - In the U.S. Senate, Obama introduced the STOP FRAUD Act to increase penalties for mortgage fraud and provide more protections for low-income homebuyers, well before the current subprime crisis began.<br>  <br>  -Obama sponsored legislation to combat predatory payday loans, and he also was credited with lobbied the state to more closely regulate some of the most egregious predatory lending practices.<br>  <br>  -Barack Obama introduced the Patriot Employer Act of 2007 to provide a tax credit to companies that maintain or increase the number of full-time workers in America relative to those outside the US; maintain their corporate headquarters in America; pay decent wages; prepare workers for retirement; provide health insurance; and support employees who serve in the military.<br>  <br>  -Obama worked to pass a number of laws in Illinois and Washington to improve the health of women. His accomplishments include creating a task force on cervical cancer, providing greater access to breast and cervical cancer screenings, and helping improve prenatal and premature birth services.<br>  <br>  -Obama has introduced and helped pass bipartisan legislation to limit the abuse of no-bid federal contracts.<br>  <br>  -Obama and Senator Feingold (D-WI) took on both parties and proposed ethics legislation that was described as the "gold standard" for reform. It was because of their leadership that ending subsidized corporate jet travel, mandating disclosure of lobbyists' bundling of contributions, and enacting strong new restrictions of lobbyist-sponsored trips became part of the final ethics bill that was signed into law.|`|HEsfhQPvaa	McCain<br>  <br>  McCain<br>  <br>  Security <br>  <br>  Energy Policy - All of the above is practical.

Not just some words in a speech but a real PLAN that I can see... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  History of Obama (not all just my favorite 10)<br>  <br>  1. He sponsored a law increasing tax credits for low-income workers, negotiated welfare reform, and promoted increased subsidies for childcare. <br>  <br>  2. In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan's payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.<br>  <br>  3.He sponsored and led unanimous, bipartisan passage of legislation to monitor racial profiling by requiring police to record the race of drivers they detained and legislation making Illinois the first state to mandate videotaping of homicide interrogations.<br>  <br>  4. During his 2004 general election campaign for U.S. Senate, police representatives credited Obama for his active engagement with police organizations in enacting death penalty reforms.<br>  <br>  5. Obama voted in favor of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and cosponsored the Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act.<br>  <br>  6. In September 2006, Obama supported a related bill, the Secure Fence Act<br>  <br>  7. Obama sponsored legislation requiring nuclear plant owners to notify state and local authorities of radioactive leaks<br>  <br>  8. In December 2006, President Bush signed into law the Democratic Republic of the Congo Relief, Security, and Democracy Promotion Act, marking the first federal legislation to be enacted with Obama as its primary sponsor<br>  <br>  9. He introduced Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act, a bill to criminalize deceptive practices in federal elections.Obama also introduced the Iraq War De-Escalation Act of 2007<br>  <br>  10. And lastly, in 2007, Obama sponsored an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act adding safeguards for personality disorder military discharges.He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Above all McCain's choice for VP showed me he is not the leader we need. She is sooooo underqualified. Look how many schools she went to and how long it took her to graduate. Although I know its not all about education Palin is an idiot in my opinon, even the people of Alaska hate her. If you cant get the 100 people in Alaska behind you then it must be a problem... <br>  |`|6JQUIZFTaa	McCain, because he has the reputation of doing what is best for our country.<br>  Not Obama, because as chairman of a board that was given 100 million to raise the standards of the Chicago School System, Obama, along with Ayers, did not.<br>  <br>  Chosen to receive a grant:<br>  The South Shore African Village Collaborative for their “Celebrate African-American Holiday of Juneteenth” (celebrating the Emancipation Proclamation). Some African-Americans celebrate Juneteenth instead of the Fourth of July (a report fromTexas). Kurtz commented that in his reporting of Obama’s previous church, Trinity United Church of Christ, some members told him that Juneteenth was their Independence Day, not Fourth of July (Kurtz did not say that all members held this view).<br>  <br>  Turned down to receive a grant:<br>  *The Chicago Algebra Project: goal to increase student achievement<br>  *The District 5 Math Initiative: goal to aid Hispanic students in the process of learning English, to further learn math and science.<br>  Kurtz characterized the information he viewed as showing grant preferences for ethnic identity projects. The grants were evidently not given to schools, but rather to “external partners,” to which schools sought to attach themselves - such as a South Shore African Village Collaborative.<br>  In the meantime, after “external partners” received millions, ethnic identity didn’t help math and science scores. It is interesting to note that this Chairman of the Board position was Obama’s first “executive” experience.<br>  There’s more: Obama’s connections to the Gamaliel Foundation, Kurtz says has a “core point” advocating for a form of “liberation theology.” He further states that his research shows that Jeremiah Wright’s Black Liberation Theology preaching is not an anomaly.<br>  Kurtz refers to a book written by Dennis A. Jacobsen, Doing Justice - Congregations and Community Organizing. This book, according to Kurtz, embodies the views of the Gamaliel Foundation. Further he asserts that Greg Galluzo, “the most important figure” in the Gamaliel Foundation, approves Jacobsen’s book, and is also an Obama mentor. Kurtz believes that Obama was a teacher at the Gamaliel Foundation before Jacobsen wrote the book. Kurtz does not know whether Obama has read the book.<br>  The last portion of the interview was given to callers and emails, most of which were angry that Kurtz was allowed radio time. One emailer confused Kurtz with Weekly Standard editor, Bill Kristol, referring to “the vile traitor Bill Kristol.” Another asked about FCC oversight of the “unbalanced” station.<br>  It was striking that few callers had anything to say more than the email’s talking points. Some pulled out the constant whine that Obama was only eight years old when the Weathermen were bombing our U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, the State Department building, etc. They further pointed out Obama has “denounced” William Ayers. He did not, however, denounce him until he was forced to for the sake of his political campaign, and he wasn’t eight years old when he and Ayers began their educational reform<br>  Look up what Obama did with the money that was raised for the botanical garden park in Chicago.

On Tuesday McCain said that he is against the bailout of AIG and would not allow it. On Wednesday after its approval McCain said it had to be done. Then Thursday morning McCain received a phone call from Obama offering to make a joint statement about the crisis on their common principals. McCain didn't return that call until 2:30 in the afternoon. At 2:35 McCain gave a press conference to annouce that he directed his campaign to contact the Obama campaign to make a joint statement on the economy and that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington and lead the passing of the bailout bill. He attempted to undercut Obama by making the joint statement appear to be is idea, unaware that the Obama campiagn had already distributed an email to the media about there intentions shortly after the phone call. McCain went to Washington when a tentative deal had been reached for passage of the bill. McCain met with his republican house members and an hour later the deal was busted. McCain and Obama were then invited to the White House to discuss the bailout. It was reported that McCain was noticeably quiet and that Obama asked questions and made comments to the Treasury secretary.<br>  <a href="http://www.propeller.com/story/2008/09/2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.propeller.com/story/2008/09/2...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...</a><br>  <br>  McCain accused Obama of "phoning in" his leadership and said that he would not do that as a leader.

However, give the media time and they'll conjure up something.|`|2342825964248c03e3b4b0af44b00b59aa	Gooz is right; exercises have all different kinds of names given them and some are single, solitary type things like what you did and others are days at a time with different events and scenarios built into them to give you experience in dealing and handling different situations under stress.  The better and more effectively you can do this the better you are able to handle real life or real world situations that you may be placed or find yourself in.  You are usually evaluated on how well you do these things during an exercise and graded and then given your results during what they call a "hot wash"  after it is all over.  So your sergeant or commander probably will soon have or now has this and is faced with the question of do you and the others need more or different training and how can you do this better if your grade was not so good.  |`|MuEqt2iJaa	In the U.S. Army, the report that you gave concerning the "incident" is called a SALUTE report...it is an acronym.

As far as when did it become mass propaganda that would be during Woodrow Wilson's term when he haired Edward Bernays. Edward Bernays developed the modern version of propaganda we now call P.R. and used the works of his Uncle Sigmund Freud to manipulate the base desires and sub consious of audieces. What he called "manufacturing consent". It is fascinating to read up on his campaigns. If you ever thought that you made rational decisions on your own, you would be surprised how effective Bernays was. <br>  Now a days the mass public has become so indoctrinated by the media that it is very easy to manipulte opinion, and many have commented on how the change in mass education has left the public vulnerable to out right brainwashing.|`|WTHTVJN6aa	The 1960's!!

OcnsptnPaa	No there will be no economic boom. Rich people invest and provide jobs. Rich people will stay rich and poor people will stay poor. It is a mindset. Poverty is a mental disease. If you are poor and won a $20 million lottery, you would be right back where you were in a few years. Poor again.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Sorry, but you might want a reality check.  Rich people invest their money.  Idle money doesn't earn a return.  Their investments include building businesses (poor people get jobs there) and buying stocks and bonds (provides money to build things with), investing in commodities like oil, coffee, pork bellies, etc. (provides a stable market for farmers), and real estate (buildings get built so people have places to live and work).  <br>  <br>  Consider Ray Kroc.  He was once an average salesman in Chicago selling milk shake machines.  His customer, the McDonald Brothers kept buying more than most.  He checked them out and saw their hamburger operation.  He bought it and with his vision you get to have a Big Mac nearly anywhere in the world.|`|TJtifnxPaa	God, no! |`|RXjnmn94aa	I disagree.<br>  Robin Hood stole from the government (tax money).<br>  While you are right about the money needing to flow, you make some bad assumptions.  <br>  I was going to pick this apart, but it is too absurd to touch.|`|AhlWfUpXaa	I disagree.

It doesn't work and your random thought will not change that.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, the rich are not rich because they SAVE money, they are rich because they INVEST money.  Like, investing in a new business to create new jobs and make even more money.  What don't you get?|`|9ChD0d9xaa	do you ever wonder how the poor got poor in the first place?<br>  <br>  The problem with welfare/overtaxing the rich is it lets a bunch of people who sit around and do nothing get enough to live on. <br>  <br>  People have a right to earn money and do what they want with it.

So he is not being like robin hood and he is being like the evil sheriff and want to take more.let see who are the people that give money to cancer research,st.jude children research,To the churches, to colleges.<br>  <br>  So you need to get your fact right.<br>  <br>  so what your trying to say is tax the rich so people that do not work can get more money to stay at home and do nothing. if you tax the rich the poor will have less jobs and less jobs to spend money in the store and some one fill your head with crap.<br>  <br>  when jimmy carter was president the interest rate was 21 percent in flation was 15 percent and unemployment was15 percent and when Reagan took office he cut capital gains tax from 70 to 15 percent and the bank interest rate to 10 and 21million jobs where created.So if you want more taxes and goverment run country then vote obama.<br>  <br>  IF YOU WANT TO BE SAFE AND BE ABLE TO SPEAK YOUR MIND AND DO WANT YOU WANT TO THEN IF I WERE YOU VOTE MCCAIN.

You also, by the way have the right after the age of 13 to refuse to live with your mother if you don't like her rules, generally the same thing happens though, good luck to you.

Per il maestro unico, non mi ritengo in grado di stabilire se sia meglio o peggio, perchè non sono un pedagogo, nè un insegnante, ma secondo me che una maestra delle elementari lavori 18 ore a sett, un terzo delle quali in compresenza, è una cosa allucinante.. in qst modo lavorerebbe 24 ore a settimana piene, ed è già un passo avanti..<br>  Sui tagli all'università, che fanno parte della Finanziaria, non sono d'accordo, perchè si dovrebbe tagliare in manienra intelligente, ovvero obbligare i prof a seguire più corsi, e chiudere le università con 5 alunni. Per quando riguarda la privatizzazione delle università, sono d'accordo perchè così potranno usufruire di finanziamenti privati e potranno sono migliorare, ma questo sempre nella misura in cui le tasse universitarie restino come sono anche adesso, ovvero tarate secondo il reddito in 15 fascie...<br>  Spero di esserti stata chiara...<br>  Ps, se vuoi andarti a leggere il decreto così com'è, ti posto il link del testo integrale che ho scaricato sul sito del Governo:<br>  <a href="http://www.governo.it/Governo/Provvedimenti/dettaglio.asp?d=40106" rel="nofollow">http://www.governo.it/Governo/Provvedime...</a>|`|ELsuxmEuaa	Contraria per i tagli dell'università (che poi non dipende da lei)<br>  Per le altre cose la Gelmini non si vantasse di aver fatto chissà cosa, se mettere i grembiuli a tutti i bambini con il maestro unico potrà farle dormire sonni tranquilli, vabbè fallo pure, sai che mi importa?|`|8h3Ek5qIaa	assolutamente contraria! <br>  L'uiversità privata è una stronzata megalomane e sopratutto con il ritorno del maestro unico tantissime persone perderanno il posto di lavoro|`|GFkZqX1xaa	favorevole |`|jLgMheWIaa	sono piu' che favorevole! io appartengo alla generazione del maestro e dell'ora completa, non quella dei 50 minuti... un bambino soprattutto alle elementari ha bisogno di una persona di cui fidarsi e non di 10 maestri che non si accorgono se c'è qualcosa che non va'.... per l'università... ricordiamo che ci sono corsi che sono a numero chiuso mentre altri frequentati da 5/6 persone...... è questo lo spreco!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|DEhE7iHwaa	La voce del Soviet è <br>  <br>  assolutamente contraria<br>  <br>  nessun taglio su scuola<br>  <br>  futuro per Paese,<br>  <br>  al massimo Soviet dà sempre stessi soldi<br>  <br>  e tu impara a spendere meglio.<br>  <br>  Tu immagina che Soviet è marito<br>  <br>  e scuola massaia:<br>  <br>  marito deve pensare a futuro<br>  <br>  distribuendo equamente risorse;<br>  <br>  questo massaia deve capire<br>  <br>  quando prende pochi soldi da marito:<br>  <br>  massaia deve imparare da piccola<br>  <br>  a essere brava a far fruttare meglio possibile<br>  <br>  pochi soldi che marito le dà.<br>  <br>  Brava massaia sovietica spende poco<br>  <br>  e fa sempre leccare baffi a marito.|`|ut3zmuYMaa	assolutamente contraria!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|3zYi0tEfaa	per la legge favorevole, invece per l art 133 della privatizzazione dello stato su scuola pubblica e sanità pubblica sono contrario.. fate attenzione perche questo è un problema sociale, berlusconi sta portando avanti i suoi progetti ormai da anni e cioè quello di privatizzare lo stato, cosi i poveri si arrangiano e chi puo pagarsi l assicurazione si cura e chi non puo s arrangia come i america.. questo se lasciamo fare vorrebbe la destra eliminare tutti gli sprechi, che poi non sono sprechi ma sono essenziali per mantenere tutti e non solo a cio che conviene ai ricchi.. per fortuna ci sono ancora persone intelligenti che impediranno tutto questo..|`|6tq7Qaamaa	Favorevole.<br>  Poi se ci sono i soliti ignoranti che la accostano all'università non ci resta che ascoltare le castronerie a riguardo.|`|aj2QFWkHaa	contrari xke un alunno deve apprendere e conoscere.|`|1N3qEjlpaa	contraria|`|9vfvvHpraa	Contrario soprattutto per la privatizzazione delle Università!

gkXLMjuAaa	Il testo è una bufala. L'appello risale almeno a luglio 2000, quando circolava soltanto via e-mail. E' approdato nei newsgroup, specificamente nel newsgroup alt.cracks, il 13 ottobre 2000. Perché è una bufala. I parlamentari hanno sì numerosi privilegi, ma non quelli indicati nell'elenco. Le cifre reali sono facilmente consultabili sui siti del governo italiano. Inoltre non esiste alcun articolo de L'Espresso che riporta i dati citati dall'appello. <br>  Prima di tutto, guardiamo la coerenza interna del messaggio. Prima si dice che "sull'Espresso di questa settimana c'è un articoletto", poi si dice "queste informazioni possono essere lette solo attraverso Internet". E già qui mi pare che la cosa non stia granché in piedi.<br>  Secondo: manca ogni e qualsiasi riferimento a date, persone, indirizzi, leggi o documenti. Si dice "stiamo promuovendo un referendum": chi? dove? Se qualcuno sta davvero promuovendo un referendum, mi pare logico che voglia far sapere dove si raccolgono le firme, come contribuire, eccetera. Invece niente.<br>  Inoltre si dice "sull'Espresso di questa settimana". Bella mossa, davvero intelligente! Così la settimana prossima il messaggio sembrerà riferirsi a un altro numero dell'Espresso, e così via. Un classico espediente per non far datare la catena.<br>  Fin qui i dubbi che saltano fuori da una semplice analisi senza verifiche esterne. Ce ne sarebbero già abbastanza da cestinare immediatamente il messaggio, ma siccome c'è tanta gente (giornalisti compresi) che non crede a una semplice verifica basata sul buon senso, approfondisco le indagini.<br>  In Google scelgo l'opzione Groups per cercare il messaggio nell'archivio dei newsgroup: ne trovo tracce in abbondanza. Una risale addirittura ai primi di dicembre 2001 (e naturalmente cita sempre "l'Espresso di questa settimana" ).<br>  Nel newsgroup it.discussioni.leggende.metropolitane, poi, trovo un sacco di gente che si ricorda di un messaggio identico risalente a ben due anni prima.<br>  Insomma, direi proprio che ci sono abbastanza dati per dichiararla bufala DOC. Per carità sulle ruberie dei politici ci si può accapigliare fino al giorno del giudizio, ma lo si può fare con dati veri, non occorrono quelli inventati. E quelli di questo appello sono inventati, secondo quanto documentato dalla Camera dei Deputati più avanti. Il Codacons abbocca all'appello. <br>  Presso il sito di un giornale telematico dedicato al Parlamento italiano, Buvette.net, vi è persino una variante: qui l'appello viene attribuito addirittura al Codacons, e viene pubblicata anche una smentita con le vere cifre riguardanti i parlamentari italiani.<br>  In effetti sul sito del Codacons, nella sezione Archivi, c'è un comunicato stampa intitolato "Cronaca Nazionale 01/02/2001 - APPELLO DEL CODACONS AI DUE CANDIDATI RUTELLI E BERLUSCONI" (tratto da qui; notate la data: febbraio 2001) che ripete esattamente il testo dell'appello, segno evidente che il Codacons non ha neppure pensato di controllare le cifre prima di aprir bocca. <br>  Tirando le somme, non credete alle cifre che vi si propinano senza fonti, cercate invece di informarvi e controllare voistessi.<br>  Saluti.<br>  <br>  Simone<br>  <br>  P.S. Avresti tutto il mio appoggio se volessi veramente provare a ridurre gli stipendi ai parlmentari, ma non penso sia possibile per vie legali.|`|J83wS43haa	Hai dimenticato:<br>  <br>  "nel 1999 c'è stata la prima copia di questa lettera circolare!"<br>  <br>  <br>  va bene... mandiamoli a lavorare... ma basta con la stessa lettera che dice ogni volta che c'è stato un aumento di stipendio ai governanti... sempre all'unanimità... sempre di 1.135,00€... sempre che nel 1999 hanno mangiato per + di un milione di euro (quando dell'€ ancora non se ne parlava a quel tempo!)... sempre lo stesso referendum per l'abolizione dei privilegi (quando non si pensa che una decina di migliaia di euro cadauno al mese gioverebbero solo all'economia dello stato!)<br>  <br>  basta con questa cosa e accettiamo la dura realtà: se non sei politico ti devi rompere il culo per diventare ricco...<br>  <br>  (e basta con questo luogo comune della desta mafiosa... quando nessun politico di sinistra si è adoperato per il bene dei cittadini... e non mi sembra neanche che avevano meno privilegi... con questo non voglio dire che è meglio la destra della sinistra ma pensiamo alla realtà dei fatti... inoltre in una crisi economica come quella che ora è in atto in TUTTO IL MONDO qualsiasi governo avrebbe tagliato...)|`|bV6ZUOvXaa	Fino a quando tutti, dico tutti indistintamente, seguiteranno a essere votati, capiranno che hanno a che fare con dei dementi e si sentiranno legittimati a fregarsene di noi e guardare solo ai loro interessi.<br>  A me fanno una pena tutti quei poveretti che ancora credono che in Italia ci siano uomini di valore fra quelli che attualmente sfilano sulla passerella del palcoscenico della politica italiana.<br>  <br>  Come si può fare per far circolare questa informazione?<br>  Fammi sapere.|`|PU3PWlC0aa	Anche loro devono arrivare a fine mese.<br>  Mi chiedo perché tutti continuino a votare per il partito del popolo delle libertà democratiche (tanto sono la stessa cosa).<br>  Questa è mafia, Signori.|`|t5X5rdp1aa	qua ti do ragione dovrebberò dimezzarsi i stipendi così trovano i soldi per fare tante cose invece di spennarci a noi...|`|SgKiEnwPaa	Questa è l'italia|`|Vij9slyTaa	CHE BRUNETTA PENSI AI PARLAMENTARI, PIUTTOSTO CHE ALLA BRAVA GENTE|`|JZllqdeLaa	in gabbia|`|0QO8QCifaa	che rabbia...voglio fare qualcosa...ma cosa??una raccolta di firme?so che ce ne servono 500.000 per indire un referendum per abrogazione di legge!!|`|121f9d81f1ac7229ab2ad3af9fb4d5a6aa	mandiamoli a lavorare...<br>  immediatamente!|`|iyTYVilBaa	Soldi buttati al cesso...e poi con quei bei faccini da sberle sostengono che bisogna tagliare, perché non ci sono soldi...GLI TAGLIEREI LA TESTA, IO!!!

This year is special, because it marks the 40th anniversary of my independence.<br>  <br>  On June 30, 1968, I escaped Communist Cuba and a few months later I was in the United States to stay. That I happened to arrive in Richmond on Thanksgiving Day is just part of the story, but I digress.<br>  <br>  I've thought a lot about the anniversary this year. The election-year rhetoric has made me think a lot about Cuba and what transpired there. In the late 1950s, most Cubans thought Cuba needed a change, and they were right. So when a young leader came along, every Cuban was at least receptive.<br>  <br>  When the young leader spoke eloquently and passionately and denounced the old system, the press fell in love with him. They never questioned who his friends were or what he really believed in. When he said he would help the farmers and the poor and bring free medical care and education to all, everyone followed. When he said he would bring justice and equality to all, everyone said "Praise the Lord." And when the young leader said, "I will be forchange and I'll bring you change," everyone yelled, "Viva Fidel!"<br>  |`|f22024ccc8d47490798933fe353a5617aa	 I'm worried that when I touch the McCain icon that Obaama is gonna light up.

I believe that it is inevitable.|`|SCXiM6VDaa	No, there will not be a civil war.  There will be some misinformed foreigners who believe the few extremist represent the nation in general.  There will be a few media outlets who pretend that the extremist are mainstream so they can argue against a straw-man. <br>  <br>  The USA is a land where a person is free to think what he wants, and say what he thinks.  The president, and congress are both limited by the constitution and the courts,  The president himself has very little real power and the Democratic party is far from united in political vision.  Local politics always trump national parties in the minds of politicians who are re-elected.  <br>  <br>  There are rare people on all sides who cannot stand to hear voices other than their own.  Some blog, some have talk shows... none are really taken seriously here.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  The 'right' to have a dozen AK47's in a suburban home is really limited to a suburban home on a military base.  Farmers who's nearest neighbor is a mile away... and often have difficulty with wildlife would not like to give up their rifles...  but no one is going to ask them to.<br>  <br>  Those who THINK they have the right to stockpile weapons so they can be part of a civil war may learn that the freedom to speak does not include the freedom to conspire to commit treason, or murder or other crimes.  They will be rightfully put down, and arrested by a well organized militia called the Police.  If all goes well, they well be tried and punished in civilian courts, and not be given the legitimacy of being war-criminals.<br>  <br>  I do not even expect domestic terrorism.  There will be no civil war, the United States will remain the United States.
xiMnj4f4aa	Alan Keyes has run for the Republican nomination.  Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Shirley Chisholm, Carol Moseley-Braun have gone for the Democratic nomination.  If people just wanted to vote for somebody that was black, they would've been elected before.<br>  Perhaps race played a small role. Lots of people would like to see America's diversity represented in the top office, but I doubt many people would toss aside their policy preference for that.  Whatever role it may have played in getting people to vote for him, I also think it played at least an equal role in having people not vote for him.  We've made some great strides in overcoming our dark history of racism in the U.S., but it is not dead completely.|`|zWwmRydqaa	It depends, but most republicans hold to my points of view. If it was a dem, they would have to be one that proved to cross party lines and oppose when needed their own party-and hold to some conservative views-it's pretty hard to find a dem that meets those requirements. And one whose own party would allow them to run. So most likely the Black Republican.|`|m2E4rLxgaa	the democrat--we couldn't wait to get rid of that republican stench they call the bush administration or anything asociated with it.|`|THNvhp3Caa	The fact that black conservatives voted for McCain instead of the black conservative Alan Keyes speaks volumes to me.|`|rsMCAlEfaa	in my own case, it's a matter of party. but in the cases of many ignorant people, it's a matter of race. but THANKFULLY this nation moved past that and although there are still a number of ignorant people out there, i am PROUD to say that they are outnumbered.<br>  <br>  i think any democrat would've won this race. the republican party is in a shambles. they screwed up...big time. they need to get themselves back together again. although personally i'd like to see them continue deteriorating. <br>  <br>  good question, btw. |`|YG14boZpaa	Obama would still be president if the races were switched. I'm sure a few voters here and there voted for Obama because he was black, but not enough to change the election. Many voted for Obama because voters found his attitude refreshing and that of a scholar. Others voted for him because they agreed with his policies. Some probably even voted for him simply because they don't like George Bush. Him being a black man got a couple biased votes, but not enough to change the presidency.<br>  <br>  Congratulations Obama, I hope you're the best president we've ever had.|`|zrfSZ6DNaa	The Democrat, as long as he was as intelligent, well spoken and cool minded as Obama is|`|OpLpq3rIaa	I wish that people would quit comparing races (color) with this election.

But honestly I voted for Obama because of his policies and attitude, and they have nothing to do with race. Besides, a very small amount of blacks voted to him compared to whites.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	If Obama were white and McCain were black, I would still have voted for Obama, if that is your question.  I voted on his policies, his vision, and his skills.  
sUN1QhdYaa	Because they didn't get their way and they can't stop whining about it. |`|ebrlN6TXaa	I believe in Separation of Church and State.... And churches need to stay out of politics.  The Mormon Church in Californica gave $30 million to defete the Prop 8.   That is why so many people are mad at the Mormon Church. |`|e1a7697c7943bcffd2fa613b82800630aa	We have been told by prophets it would be this way.  Here is what Peter said:<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is against them that do evil. <br>    13 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that which is good? <br>    14 But and if ye suffer for righteousness’ sake, happy are ye: and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled; <br>    15 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear: <br>    16 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. <br>    17 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for well doing, than for evil doing. |`|Kwfo0aRvaa	The LDS church promoted Prop 8 circulating a pamphlet called "Six Consequences if Prop 8 Fails" which was full of falsehoods. So much for not bearing false witness. <br>  <br>  The claims this pamphlet made were refuted by LDS lawyer Morris Thurston.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mormonsformarriage.com/?p=35" rel="nofollow">http://mormonsformarriage.com/?p=35</a><br>  <br>  The church knowingly divided and demeaned families with gay members (even LDS families).  The LDS church claims that homosexuals are second class citizens.<br>  <br>  Civil marriage is civil issue and should be decided as such.

Just ignore them and keep on living your life. |`|61xKM07Oaa	As you said, you are 14, you still have much to learn. Its known that the Mormon church helped fund the prop 8 initiative. That's the outrage. Same-sex marriage doesn't change the definition, it just becomes more inclusive for Gays. No one can force the Mormon church to change what they preach, but at the same time the Mormon church shouldn't have any say on matters of concern to its non followers.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Listen young lady, thats the definition according to your church. Any rational thinking human being can tell you that marriage is between TWO ADULT PEOPLE.|`|HJHNR4V7aa	Some people can not stand morals so the picket churches trying to oust God. Do not feel alone, this has happened for generations. You are right to not support gay marriage. Also, you may not realize this but you live in a state that is almost it's own country and makes laws that are outrageous. You may want to live somewhere a bit more normal someday.|`|TTiAG2Gkaa	I don't hate mormons. I'm Catholic so I know how you feel with religious intolerance.<br>  <br>  However this isn't a theocracy and I believe a persons religion is a personal matter not the law.<br>  <br>  If gay marriage is so bad name one way it can hurt a person. |`|12b1df12daca2089ecf9c4360b09326baa	Why?<br>  Because you wear magic underwear.<br>  Because your founder wanted lots of ..well.. different pussy<br>  Because you think spirits are flying around and you need to give them bodies.<br>  Because women are subservient to their husbands.<br>  Because of the Lost Boy phenomenon<br>  But if you want to believe these things, expect to be ridiculed.|`|mfP7haZbaa	dude. i'm so with you <br>  <br>  my friends and i protest for prop 8. we've had multiple large painful items thrown at us. <br>  <br>  and they say we're the haters?<br>  anyways way to go for sticking up for the church. stay strongggg, because if you don't, no one else will. |`|7aEYC0CPaa	because mormons from Utah gave a bunch of money to change California laws, because mormons went around telling people to vote yes on prop 8|`|70a202bd6feb92e50610a3b09ad8786baa	Because they do not seem to believe in our fundamental reasons for separating church and state. <br>  Though I agree that is unfair to single them out, as many other groups do this.<br>  The sacred definition of marriage? Lets see,<br>  Marriage once meant a women was owned by her husband like cattle. <br>  Marriage for LDS once meant many wives not just one.<br>  Not to mention Marriage has also meant nothing to those who say they think it is sacred when it serves their needs like when they separated slaves who where married couples and sent off their kids.<br>  <br>  It is not about picking on Mormons, its about people reacting to being picked on. That's all this law is. Millions of dollars that could have fed the hungry, clothed the naked etc...<br>  Its about excepting diversity. What the LDS church is doing is sadly passive aggressive. You can't go "I am going to make laws that punish you for not having the same beliefs as our church," that is the kind of thing that makes people angry and gets people hurt; don't trust me, let history speak for me on this one. <br>  <br>  If Mormons still wanted polygamy to be excepted as legal Marriage I would fight for their rights too!<br>  Its about compassion and excepting our differences. <br>  Its about working together to make everyone's lives better.<br>  <br>  <br>  afterthought:<br>  Mormons are mostly good smart folks who know this, I am very disappointed in this whole thing....If churches are going to funnel money like this I say they all lose their Tax exemption. I see no logical reason for them to be exempt if they use their profits for political reasons. <br>  Tax exemption should be for only those who offer a service that is available in equal measure to all who require it...maybe we could give their tax exemption to people who sustainably grow food or things like that.|`|M8LKVNUtaa	one of the main reason that gays want to get marred is so they can get the benefits of marriage like<br>  -shared SSI<br>  -work related health benefits<br>  -payed leave if their partner is in the  hospital  <br>  -adoption<br>  -tax deductions<br>  -rights to see each other in the hospital  <br>  <br>  At this point in time a gay couple can be denied all of the above benefits because they are not "marred" and most insurances companies and employers don't recognize "civil unions" and that is wrong if 2 people are doing all the things that marred people do then shouldn't they get the same benefits as any other couple?<br>  Also can you explain how <br>  "YES ON PROP 8 = RELIGIOUS FREEDOM"<br>  because some religions allow gay marriage so wouldn't it be decrementing agent some religions?<br>  <br>  edit- the definition of marriage is different world wide

3a8350c362a69a12a49a31229a281914aa	The question, as stated, says that Tanya contracted with Lester to provide services to Lester.  Therefore, formation arguments are not likely to prevail.  Moreover, the statue of frauds is not implicated because the contract could be fully performed within one year, so the lack of a writing will not defeat the contract.  Also Tanya's showing up and performing the work is an indication that she accepted the contract.<br>  <br>  The best defense is to find an acceptable reason for Tanya to stop performance.  There are two ways to approach this, which amount to the same argument.<br>  <br>  Tanya can argument that there was a mistake during the formation of the contract regarding the conditions on the bus.  She would argue that the conditions she had to work under, the noise on the bus, is a material part of the contract, that the contract was silent on, and yet that Lester knew that the conditions were material, and that his failure to disclose the conditions acted as mistake that should charged against Lester, giving Tanya the right to rescind the contract.    She might even say that lester in faliure to mention the conditions should be charges with a fraude.<br>  <br>  The other way of arguing it, is to treat the conditions on the bus as an implied condition subsequent, and the failure of Lester to provide a non-noisy work environment, discharged Tanya's duty of performance.  <br>  <br>  Using older terms (still valid today), she would argue that the noise on the bus granted her an equitably right of recession, as it was material to the contract,  and not forseeable by her at the time of formation. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>

aQTzWOImaa	Ma perchè c'è ancora questo luogo comune che l'Italia sia l'ultima ruota del carro?<br>  Siamo uno dei paesi più industrializzati del mondo.<br>  per chi volesse contestarmi dimostro quanto appena detto dicendo che facciamo parte del G8 costituito dai 7 Paesi più influenti del mondo più la Russia.<br>  <br>  Quando capitano crisi mondiali i primi presidenti che devono affrontare la questione per analizzare cause effitti e possibili soluzioni sono loro.<br>  Non mi stupisco, anzi mi rincuoro a vedere un'Italia attenta con una testa come quella di Tremonti (e qui vorrei che la gente leggesse i suoi libri prima di parlare di Tremonti vista la sua preparazione riconosciuta a livello mondiale).<br>  <br>  Mettiamo che  Spagna sia stata la prima potenza a lanciare un piano anticrisi: sarei  sicura di vedere discussioni quali "l'Italia ultimo fanalino di Coda.. cosa aspetta a fare qualcosa per la Crisi?"<br>  <br>  andiamo nel dettaglio a leggere:<br>  <br>  "Un pacchetto di interventi per famiglie e imprese, per riattivare i consumi che, con sette interventi, puntano a mobilitare 80 miliardi di risorse per combattere la crisi."<br>  <br>  Non ci basta.  allora leggiamo nel dettaglio alcuni punti:<br>  1- "Banche: fino al 2009 lo Stato potrà sottoscrivere i bond per rafforzare il patrimonio di vigilanza"<br>  lo scopo è anche - come detto da Tremonti- evitare restrizione del credito per le imprese.<br>  <br>  ottimo direi poichè son proprio le piccole e medio imprese che sono in grande difficoltà a causa della attuale crisi, Per non farle fallire è necessario concederle spesso un prestito che le permetta di fronteggiare la crisi in attesa di un out-income positivo. e per loro anche la riduzione dei costi amministrativi a carico delle imprese.<br>  <br>  2- Il Bonus famiglia. <br>  l'altra categoria in deficit causa crisi è proprio la famiglia. Questi bonus mi sembrano costituiti ottimamente e con grande anticipo rispetto agli altri paesi quindi le nostre famiglie Italiane in difficoltà avranno un bonus statale prima rispetto alle altre famiglie Europee.<br>  <br>  leggo: Il beneficio sarà di 200 euro per i soggetti unici componenti di un nucleo familiare se il reddito non è superiore a 15 mila euro, di 300 euro se la famiglia è composta da due persone con un reddito di 17 mila euro l'anno, di 450 se la famiglia è composta da tre persone, sempre con un reddito di 17 mila euro all'anno.<br>  <br>  3.e ancora: Novità per mutui vecchi e nuovi. Misura di garanzia per chi ha un mutuo immobiliare a tasso variabile e deduzione dall'Ires della quota di Irap che insiste sul costo del lavoro e degli interessi. <br>  <br>  4. aiuti anche per i mutui (cosa da non sottovalutare)<br>  <br>  5. aggiungerei gli incentivi per il rientro in Italia di ricercatori residenti all'estero: qui diciamo grazie a Prodi che li aveva fatti uscire togliendo fondi alla ricerca,<br>  <br>  6.

Almeno questo è l'obiettivo del progetto neo-keynesiano messo a punto da Silvio Berlusconi e Giulio Tremonti. Ma i fatti e il contesto rendono molto difficile forzare le cose dell'economia e tantomeno le emozioni collettive anche per chi, con tenacia, persegue la politica della positività (e del consumo).<br>  L'Europa ha scelto la via di un semi-bluff, ben presto smascherato. Il piano Ue, un agglomerato di fondi nazionali – il cui totale rischia di diventare meno della somma degli addendi – invece di creare speranza rischia di indurre l'effetto contrario e di innescare una guerra tra poveri nei Paesi di Eurolandia. La scelta di Londra di abbattere l'Iva e la tentazione di Berlino di aiutare l'auto tedesca rischiano di dare un pericoloso segnale di "liberi tutti" proprio mentre servirebbe una politica coordinata per gestire la svolta verso quella green economy che diventerà, invece, il vero cantiere dell'America di Obama. Una possibile crisi nella crisi di cui l'Europa porta tutta la responsabilità.<br>  <br>  Il Governo di Roma, con l'annuncio fatto a Washington di un maxi-piano da 80 miliardi che univa passato, presente e futuro, ha reagito d'impulso con una risposta mediatica a uso del G-20 (dove peraltro Sarkozy ha esibito dati su una crescita del Pil assai "sospetta"). Per coerenza ieri Berlusconi e Tremonti l'hanno ricordato, anche se hanno dovuto spiegare che si tratta di interventi diversi e non direttamente sommabili. Il decreto, in realtà, più pragmatico e consono a questi tempi di economia della sobrietà, mette in campo 6 miliardi "reali" immediati e ne promette 25-30 per grandi interventi entro il 2013 se andrà a buon fine l'operazione (storica) di riprogrammazione dei fondi per le aree sottoutilizzate. Con il piano Barroso se ne rimettono in gioco ancora 5, altrimenti persi.<br>  <br>  Il Governo ha rinunciato a forzare i margini sul deficit che la Ue comunque ci consentirebbe: risorse in più per mezzo punto di Pil (pari a 8 miliardi) non avrebbero destato scandalo e non è certo che avrebbero nemmeno causato i paventati contraccolpi sugli spread dei titoli di Stato. Ma tant'è. Tremonti, con coerenza da uomo delle istituzioni tanto più rispettabile perchè scomoda, rimane attestato sul deficit zero nel 2011. E disegna il canone aureo dell'economia sociale di mercato cui, da qualche tempo, si ispira: un mix tra misure assistenziali e per la famiglia (3,6 miliardi), programmi di sviluppo e investimenti (16,5 miliardi) e azioni fiscali per le imprese (2,4 miliardi).<br>  <br>  Il Governo ritiene di avere risorse sufficienti. è augurabile che sia nel giusto, altrimenti ci troveremo presto senza benzina. L'Iva è in calo e anche il gettito Ires prevedibilmente fletterà; la Robin Hood tax non ha portato nelle casse pubbliche tutto il gettito previsto, ma probabilmente la metà. Il decreto promette sconti sull'Irap e limature agli acconti Ires (non Irpef), un sistema di recupero dei crediti delle imprese verso lo Stato e risparmi virtuali dovuti a un nuovo pacchetto di semplificazioni burocratiche. Non c'è molto di più. Tantomeno la detassazione degli utili reinvestiti in ricerca e tecnologia: sarebbe stato un altro importante segnale di sistema su quale dovrà diventare il modello di sviluppo dell'Italia. Forse arriverà in futuro, forse no.<br>  <br>  L'evidente sbilanciamento a favore del capitolo infrastrutture – scelta comunque positiva – sarà anche il campo di sperimentazione del nuovo ruolo dello Stato. Il motore principale è la Cassa depositi e prestiti che cambia natura e capacità di azione perché userà senza vincoli il risparmio postale. La Cdp, poi, è stata candidata a diventare fondo di garanzia pubblica per l'azione calmieratrice sul credito e, forse in un secondo tempo, anche testa di ponte nelle partecipazioni ex bancarie al capitale della Banca d'Italia. La Repubblica diventerà poi compratore di ultima istanza per i bond delle banche necessari a riportare su ratio più competitivi il patrimonio degli istituti italiani. è chiara la nuova impronta interventista, ma nella visione tremontiana c'è un'idea di fondo di un soggetto pubblico di supporto e di correzione, senza interferenze (apparenti) nella gestione di mercato delle imprese, senza esercizio diretto (apparente) di poteri operativi. Come dire: una moral suasion "armata" o "spintanea", come quella che sarà esercitata – parola di Tremonti e Calderoli – per fermare la dinamica delle tariffe.

"Il fatto è che in Palestina anticamente non esistevano i musulmani, erano tutti ebrei..."   Sei pazza o leggi troppi "Famiglia Cristiana e guardi solo Emilio Fede ???? La tua affermazione è vergognosa, e nella sua illogica conclusione perfino razzista.<br>  <br>  Lungi da me giudicare le ragioni di una o dell'altra parte, ma è storicamente indiscutibile che l'occupante sia Israele e gli occupati arabi. (non discuto la necessità di esistere dello stato d'Israele) Che sia Israele ad avere occupato territori arabi non lo dico io, ma la storia stessa, con le decine di risoluzioni inascoltate delle Nazioni Unite in cui si condanna la ripetuta occupazione dei territori.<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Confermo di non voler entrare nel merito su "ha ragione quello, no ha ragione quell'altro".<br>  <br>  Camilla sempre piu' vergognosa, affidati pure ai giochi di parole ma basandoci sulla cronologia storica ti ricordo che basterebbe andare indietro di ancora qualche anno e non solo non c'erano i musulmani , non c'erano neanche gli ebrei in Palestina. Le religioni sono state inventate dall'uomo, gli ebrei saranno diventati "ebrei" in senso religioso quando si sono inventati l'ebraismo. Prima erano popolazioni indigene, con riti religiosi che ad oggi definiremmo "pagani" : il tentativo di difesa alle tue affermazioni razziste è assolutamente ridicolo ed illogico. "Non c'erano musulmani ai tempi di cristo", grazie al cazzo camilla, dovevano ancora inventarsi l'Islamismo.  Sarebbe come dire In Italia non c'erano cattolici nell'anno 10 dopo cristo. Grazie al cazzo, ci siamo inventati il cattolicesimo poco dopo....     o dire non c'erano Cristiani ai tempi di Tutankamon.. complimenti.. l'uomo stava ancora cercando di inventarsi una religione monoteista che fornisse adeguate spiegazioni ai misteri della vita... <br>   Non sostengo tu sia cattolico (avendo studiato i principi del cattolicesimo fatico a credere che siano realmente cattolici anche alcuni pseudogiornalisti di "famiglia cristiana" o simili, siete tutti troppo razzisti per definirvi al contempo cattolici) ma "...come al solito è stata una strisciante conquista come pretenderebbero anche fare da noi con un proselitismo di prepotenza..." confermo sembra un copia ed incolla da "famiglia cristiana" o da un comizio della "lega nord".     Oltretutto leggo un "come al solito" ??? Quale strisciante conquista arabo/palestinese ci siamo persi ?<br>  <br>  "...in quanto all' appellativo di razzista, si lo sono ma soltanto con gli islamici, ho un rifiuto totale verso queste "persone"..."<br>  Attendo con ansia le motivazioni che ti spingono ad un rifiuto totale verso quello che fatichi a definire persone. <br>  <br>  Ti farei passare una settimana a Gaza a distribuire aiuti umanitari o chiuso dentro un ospedale da campo di Emergency, chissà quante "persone" potresti "totalmente rifiutare" per via della loro religione...  Magari scopriresti che l'effetto di un proiettile di carro armato israeliano su un giovane musulmano o su uno di religione differente è molto simile. Sorprendentemente ad entrambi l'impatto devasta il corpo, strappa gli arti, sangue dappertutto, le scheggie spesso fanno fuoriuscire gli intestini dal corpo che i genitori si affannano a spingere dentro con le dita sporche, in una disperata corsa verso un ospedale in cui l'anestesia non è possibile perche l'embargo degli evoluti e civili Israeliani ha fatto esaurire le scorte di sedativi..  Durante l'operazione chirurgica mancherebbe probabilmente piu' volte l'elettricità alle macchine dell'ospedale  poiché le centrali elettriche sono uno dei primi obbiettivi strategici a venir colpiti..  <br>  <br>   Accendi il cervello Camilla, non hai nulla da perdere!

La barzelletta era questa: In cima a una collina stava lo stregone di un popolo indiano che abitava ai pendii del colle. Si avvicina l'inverno, così alcuni saggi del popolo si recano dall stregone e gli chiedono come sarà l'inverno. Lo stregone risponde che sarà freddo. Così il villaggio inizia a tagliare la legna per l'inverno. Mancano tre settimane all'inverno e i saggi si recano di nuovo dallo stregone ponendogli la stessa domanda di prima. Lo stregone stavolta risponde che l'inverno sarà gelido. Così si produce legna più velocemente. A una settimana dall'inverno i saggi consultano nuovamente lo stregone ponendogli la solita domanda. Stavolta lo stregone risponde che sarà l'inverno più freddo mai registrato. Allora i saggi gli chiedo come faccia lui a sapere come sarà l'inverno e lo stregone risponde: ? Non lo so, ma qua sotto vedo un sacco di gente che taglia sempre più legna!?.<br>  E con questo si spiega l'inesistenza della crisi. Il villaggio crede che l'inverno (crisi) sarà freddo perchè glielo dice lo stregone, e lo stregone crede che l'inverno (crisi) sarà freddo perchè vede sempre più gente che taglia legna per l'inverno. E alla fine poi l'inverno (crisi) non sarà poi tanto freddo. Basta guardare il prezzo della benzina. Prima della crisi mettevi 25 euro e ti davano venti litri, adesso con 25 euro ne metti quasi 26.

t3QAaSN9aa	Every other developed country in the world has universal health care.  If you actually looked at their programs you would see a variety of ways to address the issue of universal coverage.<br>  <br>  Nearly 1/3 of our health care costs go to administrative costs.  We could greatly reduce that amount.  I have friends in Europe who are doctors and they have terrific incomes so your references to pay cuts are not impressing me. <br>  <br>  You need to study the health care plans in Europe, Japan, Australia, Canada, etc. before making generalizations that don't hold up under scrutiny. Your simplistic analysis is fundamentally flawed.|`|YwE5kIB8aa	being a Canadian, everybody pays through income tax.  You're never turned away, all procedures are paid for, none of this fillilng out papers while your bleeding out or having chest pain or whatever happens in the US.  Being an RN I make quite a good wage, dr's still make a great wage.  I guess coporate CEO's have to take a pay cut, because their is not much of a necessity for them to be paid the over the top wages that they recieve through public health care.  But they still get a very decent wage.  The head doctor of our hospital made 250 K last year, I think thats good enough don't you.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Which question do you want me to answer first.  I'll be back when I have the time.  Why don't you ask the party of NO?|`|RVABrMeSaa	well as of now my family (3 of us) and I have Aetna. It cost us $600.00a month from my husbands salary. We also pay co-payments of $35 to primary care doctor and $45 to specialist. We have deductibles. Our doctor is contradicted by the Insurance "experts" when he prescribes they change it  to a generic or somehow less expensive drug (not always equal to). When testing is required the Aetna has to OK it, rather than take the doctors word. It is all about saving the insurance co. money. <br>  Where do you get your statistics? It is more like the top 1% (the riches) pay the least taxes.<br>  Doctors from other countries are not complaining about their income. What lies are you spreading about what the doctors will be paid. <br>  We had a great family doctor when I was growing up. He took payment from medicare and Medicaid and when asked why, he said,"At least this way I get payment" He would open his office on wednesday mornings by himself (no office staff) so he could see patients who could not afford to pay.God Bless him they don't make them like him anymore.<br>  Don't you think that a healthy nation is a strong nation?|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Well it's obvious. To many people can't afford health care AT all and those who do foot the bill for all the needless ER visits as is. But all the GOOD reasons for it aside I just want a brand new set of legs and want you to pay for them. My heart isn't in great shape so I'll take yours since you don't use it anyway. I could use your eyes too since you only read right wing gibberish and we all know that's a waste of good eyeball usage. My hearing is failing too so I'll take your ear canals too for the same reason as your eyes. I could also use a scalp transplant because, well, mine is all ending up in the drain and what good is hair on a Republican anyway? i mean you all look alike. My penis could stand a jolt, but it's to small anyway so I need the bigger penis theory.. I'll try your over developed manhood..if you have a manhood at all.<br>  My liberal liver is jaundiced from being to yellow. You gotta pay for that too. I'll even take your smell receptors because I live in Texas and all these pukes are ruining my sense of smell. kidneys? You probably drink to much beer evidenced by your ignorant ranting, but beer drinking keeps it cleaned out so you guessed it..That too.<br>  The only thing in fact that i really don't want is your brain for obvious reasons and it has nothing to do with it being to large. I have a large skull and mine seems to work just fine without your obvious attempts at changing my stance on the obvious anyway.<br>  And that my fellow Americans is why i want free health care for everyone. Science is getting us to the point we can do like the Godless Chinese government does and harvest the oppositions organs at their expense.<br>  So where's the down side to Universal Health Care?|`|nNmusYZSaa	Look into the ways it works in Europe.  They pay a pretty high tax rate, but their safety net is excellent.  I would happily pay more in taxes to guarantee even basic medical coverage without the constant risk of bankruptcy.<br>  <br>  If we instituted single-payer care, the lawyers would take the first big pay cut as frivolous lawsuits trickled off. This would allow doctors to charge less without significantly diminishing their take-home pay.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, if everyone had baseline coverage, a chest cold could be cleared up with a ten dollar prescription at a "free" (public) clinic, rather than winding up in the ER as full-blown pneumonia (at public expense).  This would radically diminish the revenues lost in the treatment of the indigent that hospitals would need to try to recoup from patients who can pay.<br>  <br>  The other sector of the "health care" profession that would suffer would be the multiple redundant bureaucracies that the current system employs to provide care to patients after shareholders have received their dividends.  Lawyers again, and CEO's who make as much in a day as their average employee makes in a year.<br>  <br>  Do you really think that we should continue paying the mo$t in the world for medical care, while achieving the 37th best clinical outcomes?  I find that to be appalling.<br>  <br>  <br>  One last suggestion that is kind of radical, but could only help:  make an EMT certificate a requirement for receiving a high school diploma. It's a 150 hour course, and if we had a better understanding of anatomy, illness, and injury, we wouldn't go flying off to the ER in ambulances nearly as often as we do. <br>  <br>  Illegal aliens too?  I don't know.

I've never asked for or received disability payments from SSI. I hate admitting that I'm physically disabled, because the only times I feel disabled is when I'm having a low blood sugar episode. The last time I saw a diabetes doctor was on November 30, 2001. I can't afford to see that particular doctor again. The bill was over $1200.<br>  <br>  A bottle of human insulin bought OTC costs almost $40. The last time I got two bottles of different kinds of insulin and 100 glucose test strips cost me over $200. Yes, I can afford to pay that. <br>  <br>  If there is support available,the only reason I turn it down is because of pride and my ability to pay my own way, which very likely will not last indefinitely. SSI has been around for 80 years. Both of my parents lived through the depression. My Dad was university faculty for over 35 years, but SSI payments were not withdrawn from his paycheck until the late 1960's. The first monthly income that stopped being deposited automatically after he died was his Social Security check. The TIAA-CREF payments lasted a few months longer. <br>  <br>  I don't know how it's going to be paid for, but, since the economy is in more dire straights right now, I don't mind waiting. I may not be eligible any way.|`|qkauXpcgaa	I'm torn. No matter what there are going to be issues with any and every health care we use. If we have universal health care we'll experience the same issues as France and Canada and be looking for other countries to go to for care. It's essentially welfare for doctors. But I know that since this country is already in so much debt that's going to fall on the shoulders of the younger generations its going to cause a great(er) burden because the government is going to recover that money through the people through taxes. I know, I for one and I'm positive their are many others that can't afford health care. No I don't think that illegal aliens should receive it, I think they should apply for citizenship and pay taxes before they receive health care.

dkkdt1FEaa	With a reported personnel strength of 779,450 in 2006 (259,050 regular force[1], 419,000 regular reserve[2], and 101,400 law enforcement Gendarmerie[3]), the French Armed Forces constitutes the largest military in European Union and the 20th largest in the world by number of troops. The French Armed Forces however have the 2nd highest expenditure of any military in the world, as well as the 3rd largest nuclear force in the world, only behind the United States and Russia. [4].    There are currently 36,000 French troops deployed overseas - such operations are known as "OPEX" for Oprations Extrieures ("Overseas Operations").    Along with the United States and other countries, France provides troops for the United Nations force stationed in Haiti following the 2004 Haiti rebellion. France has sent troops, especially special forces, into Afghanistan to help the United States and NATO forces fight the remains of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. In Opration Licorne a force of a few thousand French soldiers is stationed in C?te d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) on a UN peacekeeping mission. These troops were initially sent under the terms of a mutual protection pact between France and the C?te d'Ivoire, but the mission has since evolved into the current UN peacekeeping operation. The French Armed Forces have also played a leading role in the ongoing UN peacekeeping mission along the Lebanon-Israel border     yeah they do have an army|`|JgNjdsqOaa	In French Guyana in South America, Martinique and Guadalupe in the Caribbean, Djibouti and Reunion in Africa.

We need to dismantle any company willingly hiring illegals.    I think we should hire a company in Mexico to hold all our illegal immigrants.  The whole problem is that once we catch them here and send them back, they get to do it again.  Well we need to stop this, so my idea is to send them back, but to a prison owned by the USA, but have the citizens of Mexico run it, but not release them until we say so.  Now we all know them coming here and going to jail, is like a vacation to them.  Mexican jails suck, having them run it would be punishment.    Edit  lol you got to be kidding right?  Ok some idiot just said something like "Well they do jobs no one wants"  That is a fairy tale, how do you know people won't do them?  We do know that illegals will do them, so it must be a matter of price, if you raised the wage for an American to do it then supply and demand takes over.  It's like they still don't understand that concept, it would be worth paying someone more if no one wants to do it.  Did you know you don't have to pay taxes when you get paid, you can tell the boss not to withheld any tax if you wish.  Sure no one has to pay them, but if you get caught, then you go to jail right, now what makes you think illegals are paying them.  I'm sure their employer is telling them they are, but he's strealing it.  Why wouldn't he, he's already breaking the law!!  To Immigrate legally is impossable for most people, because if everyone could move to any country they wanted when ever they wanted we would be over crowded, with no jobs for people coming here.   We have to balance the people=job ratio!!  We can't just invite everyone over and live on welfare!!

And their families back in their home countries, as well as their home countries economy.    No our government does nothing to stop illegal immigration.  They too are behind the concept of "cheap" labor.    Celine M - Illegals are not suppose to have it easy.  That is the point behind coming here and working illegally.  To make it hard for both the illegals who are here, as well as the employers who illegally hire them.|`|AA11109310	I'm soooo sick of people say illegals have it easy and don't pay taxes and blahahahahblah..  first of all many of them pay 1,000-3,000 just to TRY to cross and risk their lives to FEED their children.  Next, they have to try to find somewhere to live, which we all know isn't easy especially w/out a social and a credit score...also many times they get paid with checks and have taxes taken out...but since they dont file their taxes they never see that money back...The US benefits big time from illegal aliens..  more people, more consumers, more spending.  I would like to see what happens one day without an immigrant.   And the government isn't doing a damn thing only building stupid wall a wall is NOT  going to stop those who want to get here... they can use a trampoline and get over it just as easy!! hahhaa|`|Vpq8CZQHaa	I will go with...

The U.S. government benefits from the taxes that they file (under fake/Fraudulent SSN's that the IRS is fully aware of) and from the spending they put into the economy. We benefit from their cheap labor which keeps the costs of the services their employers provide low. Also if you use a service or buy anything that has been performed or created by "illegal" labor then you have benefited from illegal immigration.|`|nrJXE21laa	Well, our country benefits from immigrants in a few ways, our economy benefits not only because they work jobs that not many others will (allows employers to pay less in wages) but also because of the tax dollars we recieve from them. Aside from that, the immigrants and their families do. This is more for immigration in general though, not illegal immigration. Of course the same benefits apply to illegal immigration, but trust me... those people would much rather immigrate legally... it makes life easier for them but the system makes it nearly impossible...     I don't believe the government is doing all they can or should be doing to stop illegal immigration. Deporting people will not fix the problem, we need to fix the system and until they do, we will continue to have immigration problems.

The Constitution requires that the President be a "natural born citizen".    I know Obama was born in Hawaii, but that doesn't matter, because there is a difference between a 'citizen' and a 'natural born citizen'.     A 'citizen' can be a naturalized US citizen by immigrating to the US  and applying for citizenship, a native-born citizen by just being born in the US, or a citizen by descent by being born to a US citizen parent.    A "natural-born citizen" is someone who was born to two US citizen parents on US soil.    Rep. John Bingham of Ohio, chief architect of the 14th Amendment's first section, considered the proposed national law on citizenship as simply declaratory of what is written in the Constitution, that every human being born within the jurisdiction of the United States of parents not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty is, in the language of your Constitution itself, a natural born citizen (Congressional Globe, 39th congress, 1st session, March 9, 1866)  "Not owing allegiance to any foreign sovereignty" is the key phrase here. Both parents had to be US citizens, neither could be non-US citizen because then they would owe allegiance to a foreign sovereignty.    The Supreme Court case of PERKINS v. ELG (1939) defined a natural born citizen as a person who was born on US soil to two US citizen parents.It defined it in two places; once by declaring Ms. Elg a "natural born citizen" (she was born to two Swedish immigrant naturalized US citizen parents on US soil) and once by citing the Steinkauler case, in which a young man was born on US soil to two naturalized US citizen parents and said of him "in due time, if the people elect, he can become President of the United States"  See PERKINS V. ELG - http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ge...    It was also defined in MINOR v. HAPPERSETT (1874) http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/ge... where the court said "At common-law, with the nomenclature of which the framers of the Constitution were familiar, it was never doubted that all children born in a country of parents who were its citizens became themselves, upon their birth, citizens also. These were natives, or natural-born citizens ..."    In the Supreme Court case of Kwock Jan Fat v. White, 253 U.S. 454 (1920) The father of Kwock Jan Fat was a native-born US citizen, born on US soil of Chinese nationals. The mother of Kwock Jan Fat was a naturalized US citizen by virtue of her marriage to a US citizen. http://supreme.justia.com/us/253/454/cas...  Kwock Jan Fat was Born of two US citizens on US soil and thus a "natural born citizen."    To be eligible to serve as the President of the United States, the person must be a 'natural born citizen' (or a citizen at the time of the adoption of the constitution) per Article 2 Section 1 of the US Constitution. http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/...  Barack Obama's father was not an immigrant to the US. He was in the US on a student visa and was a British/Kenyan citizen. He never had "legal resident" status and he never applied for US citizenship.    Obama isn't a Constitutionally legal President.

AA11518835	There is no way that the plan is going to help the country.    Mark my words- No Way.    There are three ways that the US government can pay for these programs.  1) Take money from productive areas of society in the form of taxes    2) Borrow the money from some other country, particularly China    3) Print more money      If they tax the productive areas of society, they hurt business because they have less money to invest, to hire, and to research and develop. The average American pays 18.2% Federal Income tax (not including state and local taxes). The corporate tax rates, depending on how they are measured, are either the highest or second highest in the entire world.    When the govt usurps this money, they put it into government programs that have no system of competition with the free market. They are not subject to "bottom lines" or "profit margins". They are artificial entities that exist purely to spread the wealth that has been created through productive means to areas that are unproductive.    If they borrow the money, we will still end up with the bill. Right now the US economy is based 60% on consumption and only 40% on production. In other words, we send more money overseas than overseas sends us. Like a family of four, an economy cannot spend more than it produces without amassing debt, or in our case, more and more debt.    What will happen, and is happening, is that the Federal Reserve will just print more money to pay for this "stimulus". There are countless examples throughout history where this resulted in hyperinflation, particularly the Weimar Republic in Germany, where a barrel of marks couldn't buy a loaf of bread.    This is what we will see within 2 years- hyperinflation. The best evidence for it is the fact that there is 70% more money in circulation than there was only four months ago.      The only solution to help the economy is to cut taxes and reduce government spending. We need to abolish Income tax and the Federal Reserve and move back to the gold standard.      As with evolution in nature, the weak businesses are supposed to flounder. If the productive businesses are required to pay for the unproductive businesses to survive, then the productive business are inhibited, and the weak survive. Evolution works by survival of the fittest, not by survival of everyone.    If we keep moving towards survival of everyone, even the weak, then the drain on the fittest will be so large that the whole system will be incapable of evolving. It is true in nature, and it is true in economics.|`|GJKWgx0Paa	imo, most of President Obama's proposed economic programs are simple vote buying on behalf of the Democrats and will have little or no valuable impact on the recession.    To get people to significantly change their economic behavior, you have to permanently change the marginal cost and/or benefit of the proposed action.    Thus, you can choke off investing by raising taxes on capital gains and dividends, which the Democrats propose to do.    That this will also choke off buying new tools and equipment for the American worker to use, for which the American worker gets paid extra [according to economic studies, workers get between 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the extra value from adding more or better tools and equipment in the form of pay raises], seems to have escaped the Democrats.    Similarly, non-residential housing capital investment has declined all of 1% from 2007 levels -- hardly a situation that requires government intervention.  Adding more tens of billions of spending in that area, most of it in 2010 or later, will likely cause price increases because capacity in that area is near fully used.    The low income tax rebate proposal puts zero new dollars in the hands of low income workers until they file their 2009 tax returns -- a year from now.    And on, and on.      The program is poorly thought out and badly misdesigned if its purpose is to stimulate the economy.    Since President Obama's advisors aren't complete idiots, it is obvious that the program's real purpose is to use the excuse of the recession to spend, spend, spend on the Democrats' constituents in the hopes that the added spending will become permanent and thus Democratic control of the levers of power will become permanent.    Which, of course, spells high tax ruin for the economy.|`|v1Y3dvjgaa	Nope. We have given up a lot in electing a Marxist.  You will see income redistribution like never before.

Many of them probably wish the USA  nowadays showed the same restraint as they did then, and was less inclined to rush into wars, considering all the casualties they have suffered in recent years.  I think in any scenario, the USA would have joined WW2 eventually. Had they not joined at all, Britain might not have won at El Alamein as early as 1942 (which Churchill called "the end of the beginning") but the Russians would still have won at Stalingrad and eventually forced the Germans back west, but more slowly.  With only one front to fight on in the European mainland - no invasion of Italy, no Normandy - the Germans would have held out longer. Either we would have had to accept a stalemate armistice, or the Russians would have made virtually all of western Europe communist.

It seems unlikely that a person who is an officer of the court would do anything illegal. Which is not to say that it does not happen. There are some situations which are of such marginal value or legality that they need to be settled in court, and an attorney would be more likely to know that.    The condo board should consult its won attorney and not take advice from random strangers on the Internet.|`|AA11622716	If it is true that the bank owns it and has not given permission for him to be there, then yes there are some laws involved.

If the condo board gets to decide who lives there then they need to speak up.  If they don't get to decide who lives there then they are SOL because, as you said, the bank owns the condo.
TJ2EfH7oaa	Racism :  the hatred of one person by another -- or the belief that another person is less than human -- because of skin color, language, customs, place of birth or any factor that supposedly reveals the basic nature of that person.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, ~everybody~ has become too touchy about this subject.  Hardly anything can be said any more without someone thinking "racism".  If Obama has big ears, then JoeBlow ought to be able to say that without other's thinking he is being a racist.  If JoeBlow is black, then all is ok...but if JoeBlow happens to be white, then OH GEEZ!  he MUST be a racist !!<br>  <br>  I know that racism is real, and it is destructive.

How can you blame someone just because you don't like the way they look when we cannot choose our parents. We all have flaws, scars and insecurities, some visible and some we hide inside.Those individuals who usually make fun of another persons appearance are the most insecure about themselves or  very immature.<br>  <br>  Racism becomes intolerable when  innocent people suffer for things which they have no control over such as; employment,  personal growth, personal safety, health and happiness.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion.|`|gRfqjemmaa	From Wikipedia:<br>  Racism is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.

(This is just an example). Basically, putting discriminating against a race. <br>  <br>  <br>  My classmates are really immature. They think 'racism' is when you call someone of their skin color. For instance, I forgot an actor's name in a movie, and he was African-American, so I asked 'What was that guy's name again in this movie?" and they would say "which man?" and I'd say "the black one", and they're all "OOOH YOU RACIST!". <br>  It purely disgusts me; I tell them to look up the word before they use it. <br>  <br>  Note: My english teacher told me not to call African 'black', but call them Africans; Caucasians not whites, and Asians not yellow.

iJQqX37daa	Yes and No...that depend on your rank. I was in the infantry and we had a Medical person assigned to my unit...His name is "DOC'|`|n2oEhdZiaa	If you are assigned to an Infantry battalion, there are (I think) three main duty positions.  You can be assigned to a medic team, which is what you want to be it sounds like.  These teams go from the Battalion Headquarters Company out to the line companies.  You would be assigned a platoon of Infantry to take care of.  i.e. monitor their well being, teach them casualty care, and patch them up when injured, etc.  You could also be assigned to the battalion's internal ambulance team.  You would be driving forward to pick up the casualties and treat them while bringing them to a hospital for treatment or to a less active area for pick up.  You could also be assigned to the Battalion Aid Station, which is where the medical officer is.  You'll be doing a more serious level of treatment there, etc.  Of course, all this was from a light Infantry perspective.  I think they staff and man things a little differently if you're in a Combined Arms Battalion with Brads and Abrams mixed.  Good luck.|`|wrLu93C9aa	Yes!
