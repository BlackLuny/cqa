20090309200614AA84lBw	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	My 1800's era apartment has ceiling leaks and I am tired of it. Help!?	I have lived in my current apartment for almost two years. It is a old building from the late 1800's. About 7 months ago the kitchen ceiling in my apartment had a leak from a pipe in a corner. My lousy building manager didn't even believe me when I told him about the leak. When the plumber came to fix it the wet logged ceiling tile came tumbling down along with leaving a gaping hole in the corner of the ceiling. You could literally see upstairs into the next apartment. The plumber replaced the pipe with some cheap looking rubber hose which threads through the ceiling. The cheap rotted  wooden slats also fell down and the wood has a huge hole in it. The landlord just replaced the drop ceiling tile, but did not plaster up the hole underneath it. When you come into my kitchen you can't tell how bad the ceiling is because of the drop ceiling hiding all the damage. Now it is months later and I have a kitchen ceiling leak again. Except in a different corner. Directly beneath my upstairs neighbors bathroom. I don't know if it is them dripping out of the shower on the floor again or another pipe leak. For several months the pipes have been making a drumming noise every time someone upstairs would turn on the water. These pipes look to be made of rubber tubing, not the pipes you would see in the bathroom. The cheap looking pipes actually thread through my ceiling upstairs and are exposed when you remove the drop ceiling tile. In addition, my living room and bedroom have cracks in the wall and ceiling, which are probably from the foundation settling. This building was built as a business establishment, not made to be apartments. This building can't handling all this activity. It needs to be professionally renovated and restored. The landlord just put a bandaid on it and made it look good from the outside. I hate this apartment. I don't want to go through this again with having another leak. It left huge ugly water stains on my ceiling and I had to beg the landlord to replace the tile. The landlord supposedly spent $20,000 on renovations. He just basically put in new cabinets and a new refrigerator, he surely didn't update the ceiling,walls,bathroom. My bathroom doesn't even have a electrical outlet in it. I don't know what to do? My lease is up in a few months. but I don't have money for a security deposit to move. Do prospective landlords allow tenants to move in without a deposit? I have to get out of the hell pit. Please help!

It was in my cupboard for maybe two weeks below other moist clothes, or the shirt may have been moist at the time, which would explain how it built it. I knew I should have washed my expensive clothes separately, but haven’t had this happen before. I did the only thing I knew, which was spray the area thoroughly with a stain remover for colour, but after putting it through a washing cycle alone with the regular washing powder as instructed, surprisingly no improvement. If you’re going to recommend something like bleaching, could you be specific with the instructions? Thank you!

20090309211215AAczdaL	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Why do my blue dress shirt collars fade after washing?	I've had decent luck in machine washing most of my dress shirts. However, I'm noticing a pattern with my blue dress shirts - they all become faded around the collar after washing. On some of the blue dress shirts the fading increases gradually, but today I washed one shirt for the second time and it was really bad. The first time I washed it there was no problem. What could be causing this?       I've heard it could have something to do with the sweat on my neck, but that doesn't explain why it wouldn't be all dress shirts?      I do tend to buy cheaper detergent, so I may switch to a more expensive detergent and see what that results in.

20090309212318AAxwKqF	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Best joining method for particle board shelves?	I'm building shelves using 3/4" melamine particle board. The shelves are 16" wide in an inside corner of a closet (making an L). Along all surfaces I'm able to set the shelves on 1x2 ledgers except where one shelf butts another on the inside corner. I'm wondering what is the best method for joining the end of one shelf to the edge of the other. I haven't worked with particle board much, so I don't know how well dowels, biscuits or pocket holes compare. Obviously the most important thing is withstanding sheer down-force on that inside corner, so what is going to be the strongest?       Thanks, Jeremy

20090309214656AANZzSN	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Carson Pirie Scott custom furniture - How do I figure out what brand/model I bought?	About 5 years ago, I bought a chair from Carson Pirie Scott -- I picked a fabric and had it custom made.  Now I'd like to buy the matching ottoman, but I don't live in an area with a Carsons.  I was hoping that I could figure out the brand/model of the chair and order online from the manufacturer or take it into another department/furniture store and see if they could order it.  But, the tags don't have anything recognizable as brand/model, just some codes / numbers.        I thought I would give it a shot and see if anybody here knew anything about this before I called a Carsons or just brought in the tags to a furniture store.  Any ideas?  Are there any websites that might be able to help me out (e.g., custom furniture places)?
