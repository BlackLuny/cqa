Don't you think God reveals his Universal secrets from time to time, so that folks may have a belief.      Many died in the past believing or disbelieving God, and if in future science or scientists prove or discover that there is a real Heaven, Hell, and there is An Only One Deity / God, what do you think wud be the fate of those who died in disbelief waiting for science and scientist to prove or present a theory....?            Thank you so much      :)
20090131202523AArqHer	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Should God have answered the girl's pleas for forgiveness by stopping her execution?	Before she was hanged for drowning her baby the 20 year old girl pleaded with God to keep His promise to forgive her which she took to understand to mean that He would save her life.      The woman has vehemently claimed her innocence admitting that while she killed the baby she didn't mean to do it. What should we ask God as the rope is placed under the girl's neck as she is prepared for execution?      Questions from this story:  What is or should be God's role in all this? How should we communicate God's message in such a situation? Should the girl have been put to death? The evidence is that her intentional acts caused the baby to drown

20090226081604AAS90jf	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do Christians say that asking Jesus in their heart with confession isn't biblical?	When it is written that if we confess with our mouth Jesus Christ our Lord while believing in our heart He raised from the dead, we will be saved.      Heart is used interchangeably with being spiritual over & over in the Bible. Circumcised of the heart, where our heart love & thanksgiving praises are to God & not so much man & mans accomplishments. He will give us a new heart & write His love laws on them.      Believing in ones heart, isn't mental assent. Or just believing mentally what someone told you. You need to believe in your heart. It is written in the OT that the Holy Spirit (7eyes of God) goes to & fro seeking whose hearts are toward the LORD.      Who can tell a child who asked Jesus into their heart that he or she isn't saved. That this is a heresy.   Or worse, to tell a child that they can't pray that. Don't you think that Jesus will get mad at the self righteous person? That the person is in danger of hell fire to lead a little child away from Jesus?      When believing in our heart is a step to being born of Gods Spirit. And God the Father draws our heart unto Jesus?

20090131150944AAAcOqm	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Is this V-day gift excessive?/V-day gift ideas for boyfriend?	I'm having trouble coming up with a gift for my boyfriend of 9 months. We are both around 14.   I started knitting him a scarf, but it is a little too wide and taking a bit of time. At first I thought that he could fold it and went on. One of his friends said that the idea was sweet when he found out, and has encouraged me in finishing it. However, even if I do finish it in time, I'm not sure he would like it just for the sentimental value if it was partially unusable since he is not an extremely emotional/sentimental guy. He would probably be embarassed if I gave him something at school around anyone. Is this idea excessive?       He likes music, playing music, writing music, etc., and plays french horn. He has a dog, and plays the card game Magyk. Again, he's not too sentimental. I didn't want to get him something birthday gift-ish, (and I don't know much about Magyk or specifically what bands/etc he likes) just maybe some nice chocolate and something else.   I'm not sure he'd be into those mini IOUs or anything, so I'm not sure what he'd like or be mildly embarassed about. I'm afraid that if I do anything too sentimental he'll think it is corny.

20090226084837AAbX7dJ	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	He reverted to Islam then died ! www.islamway.com?	ONCE UPON A TIME..(this story was sent to me by a dear sister in islam..jazaha LLAH khayran....amiiin....      A man used to live in Saudi Arabia originally from India was a Siekh, and a Muslim Shaik  ( Muhammad Farrag ) used to invite him a lot to Islam. He neither refused nor accepted the idea because of his family.       Then one day Allah opened his heart to Islam, he came to the shaik in his mosque to embrace Islam. The shaik was busy with his students and some Du’ah (Muslim missioners who invite people to the worship of Allah).      Sheik Muhammad did not know that the man wanted to enter in Islam so he did not give him any attention and he left the mosque with his students.       The man, who wanted to enter in Allah’s religion, remained standing at the door of the mosque watching the shaik and his students riding their cars and moving away. On that sight he could not prevent himself from crying and burst into tears. While he was standing weeping at the door of the mosque, a young man who lived in the same quarter passed by him.      He asked him about the reason of his crying and the Indian replied that he wanted to be a Muslim.       The young man (May Allah rewards him the best) took him to his house. He made him perform abulution (wudoo) and say the two testimonies (No god but Allah and Muhammad is His Messenger). The Indian left after he said the testimony and it was about the dusk prayer (Al-Maghrib). Then he went to his room and suffered from a severe stomachache.      The young man came to shaik Muhammad and told him the whole story. The shaik repented what he had done though he was ignorant of the matter. He went to the Indian’s room, but his colleagues told him that he had died last night and he was then in the fridge of the Central Hospital. The shaik went with some Du’ah to the hospital to receive his corpse, but the hospital refused stating that the embassy had sent to his family in India and they would receive his corpse to be burnt there. The sheik objected saying that the man became a Muslim and there were witnesses on that, but still the hospital refused.       Sheik Muhammad went to Shaik Abd Al-Aziz Bin Baz (May Allah rest his soul and have mercy upon him) and told him the whole story. Shaik Abd Al-Aziz said that the Indian should not be given to his family as he became their brother in Islam; they should pray on his corpse and bury him there. He should not be given to the unbelievers. Sheik Abd Al-Aziz sent a copy of the subject to the emirate and requested an order to give the corpse to sheik Muhammad Farrag.      The emirate ordered the hospital to give the corpse to Shaik Muhammad and he received it. Some Du’ah washed the man and put him in his coffin. The funeral prayer coincided with Al-Goma’ah (the congregational prayer). Shaik Muhammad gave a wonderful oration on the one who embraced Islam then died without making one prostration to Allah. He stated in the first oration some similar examples from history, then he stated in the second one the story of the Indian man upon whom they would pray after Al-Goma’ah. The Muslims pray upon him, then they carried him upon their shoulders and they all went to the graveyard led by a lot of Du’ah and scholars.    It was a moving scene, May Allah accept (his deeds) and have mercy upon him.   Written by meteor at clouds site.      On the Authority of ‘Abdullah bin Mus’ud (May Allah be pleased with him) who said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), the true and truly inspired said, “(The matter of Creation of) a human being is put together in the womb of the mother for forty days, and then he becomes a clot of thick blood for a similar period, and then a piece of flesh for similar period. Then Allah sends an angel who is ordered to write four things. He is ordered to write his (i.e. the new creature’s) deeds, his livelihood, his (date of) death, and whether he will be blessed or wretched (in religion). Then the soul is breathed into him. By Allah who is no God but Him, a man amongst you may do (good) deeds till there is only a cubit between him and paradise and then what has been written for him decides his behavior and he starts doing (evil) deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire so he enters it. And similarly a man amongst you may do (evil) deeds till there is only a cubit between him and the (Hell) Fire, and then what has been written for him decides his behavior, and he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise so he enters it.” Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim.          SOBHANA LLAH, ALLAH(swt) is full of mercy, this man didnt die but a true muslim...alhamduli LLAH.   assalamo 3alaykom wa rahmato LLAH wa barakatoh.

Ok all you people out there that have pitbulls, do they have these same wierdo behaviors lol???   1. They refuse to play fetch   - You throw the ball and they will go get it and never bring that **** back no matter how long you try to teach them to play fetch they just arent interested   2. They like to sleep under the blankets   - Mine comes up to the top of the blanket every night and paws at it like let me in *****!   3. They love swimming   - Even when its 20 degrees outside   4. Obviously, they love to chew **** up especially shoes lol    If you have anything else that you noticed the pitbull breed does add it.    Please no nasty comments about this breed like they are vicious and stupid **** like that cuz if anyone had half a brain they would know that these dogs are beaten and abused really bad and forced to fight by people and thats why they end up vicious These dogs are NOT vicious b nature...its the owners that make them vicious. If you dumb people that think these dogs are creul vicious and bad have you noticed a pattern?? First it was doberman pinchers, then german shephards, rotty's , and now its the pitbulls turn!!! So as you can see throught history theres always been a breed singled out

20090226084934AAsFvwJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	When Jesus said "Love ye one another." did he qualify that in any way?	Let us first of all assume he was speaking to adults.      "Love ye one another."        My question is this:    Did he qualify it in any way?  Did he, for example, say "Love ye one another, all except for gays."?      I would be interested in knowing if he excluded gays when he said that.      If not, then my next big question is:    If Jesus didn't specifically exclude gays and forbid them from loving each other, then why are church folks doing it?   .

Some people say it's a type of dinosaur, and some people say it's a type of extra large hippopotamus. I think it could be possible that there were dinosaurs in that time, because sin hadn't entered the world yet, and certain animals weren't aggressive yet. If anyone has a opinion, just let me know!

For example: I stated that I was going to go and get my car washed at lunch time. When she leaves for her lunch, she comes back with a clearly freshly washed car with tire wet on her wheels. This is like a daily thing. I'll buy some new shoes, and she will come in the office with the same ones in a different color. Or she'll see a product (makeup etc.) im using and literally show up the next day with the same product. This lady is sooo weird, and it's becoming really annoying.       Can anyone explain this behavior? This is literally a daily thing. I could give more examples, but I'm sure you get the gist of what I am talking about...
20090226083648AAOJnTQ	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My friend is hurting my feelings, what should I do?	I've been online friends with Mary since 2002 (we're both in our 30s). I'm gay and she's married with a 3-year-old. We met through LiveJournal and have kept in touch via e-mail and occasionally on the phone.       The past year or so, she hasn't answered my e-mails. She emailed me about a two months ago and said that's she's been depressed and is trying to get back on track (job issues, etc.). Other than that e-mail, and a phone call from her in November for my birthday, I haven't heard from her. I answered her e-mail but never heard from her again.       A couple weeks ago I e-mailed her and said that I hope she's feeling better and that her lack of response is rather hurting my feelings. She never responded. I see her responding to people on Facebook, but she hasn't commented on things I've told her.      Not sure if I should just keep things as they are or what. Her birthday is March 11th, so I'm wondering if I should send her a message? It hurts that she hasn't responded to me. I'm going through things in life, too.

20090131151755AAzCDaF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do ppl think the Caylee Anthony case is getting too much attention?	People keep asking why is this getting so much airplay. I don't see that happening. In fact, Nancy Grace is the only time I ever see news from the case. Even they stopped following the case for awhile. I watch CNN and MSNBC, and never see anything about this case. What are people talking about? I think it originally got attention because of the circumstances of the case: Casey waited so long to tell anyone and was out partying. There have also been a lot of developments happening lately, so of course, the news is going to keep updating. Caylee captured the hearts of everyone, and people naturally want to know what happened. It's true - parents kill their kids all the time, but I'm glad when any one of these cases gets attention because I think it is a big problem, esp. when you have babies having babies. I recently saw a case where a teen mom's boyfriend killed her kid out of frustration. Maybe teens will think before uncrossing their legs if they see consequences like this. Not that all teen parents go on to kill their kids, but most aren't fit for parenting. So, I don't get why anyone would be discouraged about this story getting press.

I'm not so fond of people who stare, I mind my own business as much of the time as I can, which means avoiding people unless we have to interact by means of work.      At times when I'm driving, I'll also get your typical dumb guys driving next to me to check me out...it gets so old and annoying to deal with. I'll just stare at them back usually and scowl, or make some ugly face so they can turn around, although I shouldn't be giving them much attention at all....notice I have APD...So I hate it also when people try to get my attention and I'm just doing my own thing..

I have pretty long, past my shoulders hair that i get highlighted/dyed blonde, but it's professionally done. Some people really love it, I have a few friends that do. My parents HATE it, and that's that. Some people think I should be in THIS careerpath, others think THAT, it's just ultimately so confusing because I feel like I'm being pulled in 100000000000 different directions, and I'm not happy ultimately because it's not what I want personally.      So in the end what should I do, just go ahead with what I want regardless of what anyone else thinks or what?      My parents even made the comment to me "You're not going to get hired anywhere with THAT hair, unless you work in the fashion industry."

20090226084741AA8fYUB	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Hedonist vs. Christians?	Im wondering how the views differ between the two. I was told by a Christian a long time ago that my style of beliefs pointed strongly to a Hedonist. He told me that he thought they worshiped the same God, just in different ways.       My style of beliefs are relatively simple, I am all about enjoying life. I want to experience all I feel God has put here on Earth. No matter what it is, well except for your basic child sex, rape and murder, I feel that nothing really is too taboo to experience once in my lifetime. Well I personally also wont really go and try homosexualality, but I dont judge others who do. I personally just know I wouldnt like it, so I dont want to try it.      But I actually feel that to worship God by always going to Church, praising his name, trying to convert others, etc., is actually something that God doesnt want me to do. I seriously just feel that God wants me to have fun while Im alive. And worshiping and living a cautious type life based on alot of rules by the Bible doesnt seem to be what was intended for me.       Ive never read the Bible, I just started yesterday, afterwards though I plan on reading the AntiChrist Bible because I was told that it deals with worshiping no one, and relying on yourself. Not that it deals with Satan, so I figure if anything, its just another book on Philosophy more or less.       Also do Hedonists have a Bible? What are the views and lifestyle of a Hedonist compared to a Christian? Also please nobody bash on Christians or Hedonists, or anyone. Your views are yours, but if your views are simply negative in general, then you dont need to reply to this question, thanks for any good answers. I know religion seems to be a weird thing to talk about now a days, and everyone seems to get negative and hateful pretty fast.

I belong with country there mostly Christian are converted from other religion. I like to open or support the some Bible schools in area where there are not any resources for Christians believers and their kids. Why?  coz is that when people accept the Jesus but then while nobody is there to tell more about Christ, They go back to their last faith. Same thing happen with me also  when I was child I didn't got any Bible education and environment was different over there but I got luck & somebody helped me and took me to the boarding house and I got good education about Christianity and God. So now I am the believer. I did my best when I was with my people but now I got overseas job to give some financial help my family and some other needed people. I believe that if  we give good education to the Kids then they will share Bible stories and Word of God with their parents and families. Mostly people are uneducated.

20090131164123AA4UrqX	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your take on this type of person?	A person claims to be a devout Christian to the point of being a rabid zealot. Yet they are incredibly judgemental of anyone who doesn't agree with their personal beleifs. Meanwhile, for the same amount of time that they spend reading their Bible (which is quite frequently) they are also a porn addict which the Bible clearly states in many places that God doesn't allow that type of thing if you are to be a follower of his, meanwhile totally denying that fact when it is brought against them. So would you consider that person to be a true Christian or a blatant hypocrite? And would you trust anything they had to say based on your judgement of them due to their actions?

20090131162937AAdpHDy	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does this make sense?	This is based on an incident that happened in school.      On Monday, I had 4th period gym.  During gym, a kid challenged me to basketball.  I accepted.  The score was 1-1.  During the game, he was pushing me when I went to take a layup.  At one point I was running full speed, driving up with the ball to take a layup and he full out kicked my shins.  I fell to the ground directly on both of my knees.  Since I was running really fast, that just put more strain on my knees.  My gym teacher saw what happened and called the kid over to the side.  My gym teacher spoke with the kid and asked my gym teacher asked me a couple of times if I was ok.  I said I was ok.  I told my gym teacher that I wanted to continue the game against the kid because I wanted to beat him.  I couldn't walk properly and I couldn't run at all.  I continued the game against the kid and I beat him 11-1.  Gym ended like 5 minutes later.  I went to the nurses office directly after.  I told the nurse that I was kicked and I fell on my knees.  I asked for an ice pack and they gave me two ice packs to use for my knees.  I went to Chemistry class during 5th period.  I didn't want to go to the Principal that period because I was learning something new in Chemistry.  6th period, I had to take an economics final so I didn't go that period either.  7th period, I had Advanced Computer Applications so I went to the main office that period.  I asked to see the principal when I arrived there but he wasn't available.  Instead, I spoke to one of the assistant principals.  I told her that the kid intentionally kicked me while I was playing basketball and that I fell on my knees and that they were hurting.  She asked me if I went to the nurse and I said yeah.  She asked me if I wanted to go with her to the nurse again and I said no because I don't want to risk being sent home because I had more tests that day.  I didn't tell her that I continued playing with the kid after I fell because I thought that was irrelevant information.  She said that she will call the kid  down and call his parents.  That same day, I went to the emergency room because my knees were in too much pain later on.  I was diagnosed with bilateral knee hematoma which means bone bruises in both knees.  My dad spoke with the assistant principal and she said that she called the kid's parents and left a message on their phone.  My dad spoke with my gym teacher on the phone and he explained everything to my dad.  I didn't tell my dad about continuing to play with the kid, because once again, I thought it was irrelevant information.  Today, the assistant principal calls my dad saying that they aren't going to do anything to the kid because the kid claims it to be an "accident," and because I continued to play with him.  I only continued to play with him to beat him and get him off of my back for a while because all he does is annoy me everyday.  Now, I can't walk properly and I can't run at all and the school isn't going to do anything to the kid.  The kid claims it to be an "accident," but I have almost the entire gym as a witness as to what happened.  Even some of the kid's supposed "friends" would probably vouch for me.  So many people saw what happened and yet still nothing happens to the kid.       Shouldn't something happen to the kid?  He should be suspended for intentional violence.  The fact that I continued to play basketball shouldn't make any difference.  That was all based on a sense of pride and an adrenaline rush.  Of course I wouldn't feel the damage immediately.  I would only feel it later on, which I did.

Also, how do you explain the Treaty of Tripoli in 1797 which was approved by President John Adams and ratified by the Senate?

20090131160536AANb4de	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Did Christianity or wanting to be a Christian HIT you at a time when  you thought you were horrible?

20090131160304AAdYEwb	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do any of you Christians even know how Christianity became a religion?	Saul started it... in and around 70 AD. Did you know the only parts of Jesus' life he was aware of was the tail end, where Jesus was crucified, rose and ascended, and even he thought that was just a 'myth'....?      Do you realize that the Jesus story is pretty much the pattern ancient literary mythological writers like Homer used to 'create' the tale of a Heroic figure... (Check out Dionysus, Hercules, and Osiris... you will find they lead the same lives.... there are TWENTY TWO points of 'action' that heroes of mythic stories tend to follow...and all of these Heroes followed the same path of Jesus whether they can before or after....)      How do you explain that MODERN Christianity makes NO SENSE?

Management hired temp staff, and there's this one girl who I avoided at first because it was awkward that no-one had introduced us. But then, someone did, and every time we see each other, she looks me in the eyes for ages, and just smiles really fondly. This happens like a million times a day, without fail- if we're 3 feet away or 50.      You know how if you pass one of your colleagues or schoolmates, you kind of give a short smile and walk off? Well we just hold a gaze for 5-10 seconds, and she's got this smile that's kinda intimate.      Well, she's leaving in 3 days, and we don't get a chance to speak because the store is manic-busy. All I have is her first name.      What can I do? Does it sound like she's just being friendly, or could there be more to it?      TIA.

I would like for someone to help me understand and/or figure out why I sometimes become deeply infuated with other women. Two times in my life I have felt emotionally and physically attracted to another women but could not/can not do anything about it. One of those times is currently happening to me.      My branch is currently working with an all new staff, so we have had an employee from another branch come in to help us out. It hasn't gone unoticed by me that she is pretty, young and an outgoing woman that I feel attracted to as a friend. I like her a lot and feel like I want to know her outside of work, but I am afraid to ask.      I am in my mid-twenties, have never experienced a romantic relationship, and have had a bit of a rough childhood that doesn't allow for me to easily trust others and make friends.

20090131161814AAiPmng	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	I avoid immigrant customers, am I bad?	I currently work in a clothing store and it seems like the immigrant customers are the WORST.  First, I have to strain myself to understand them while they ask me stupid questions in bad English like what the size of something is, or the price of something even though tags are on everything!  Then at the till they always keep asking me for discounts on items that are already on sale, even after I have told them no like 5 times!  They will also get me to do annoying things like check for cheap shirts or pants by calling all the other stores, even when I tell them that we are the only clearance store and no one else has last year stock.  They will just beg with me to call anyways so there is no use.      Now when I see them coming I slip to the back and let my coworker deal with the frustrations.        Am I terrible for feeling this way?  I just feel like I could run 10 natural citizens through the till with all more pricey items than I could selling one $9.99 shirt to an off-the-boater while they get me to "measure the sleeves" for a medium sweater.

20090131152210AAyNHxT	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is this gender discrimination?	I work for a small family run company, our office is 25-30 people, the majority of the staff is women. In my department there are 6 of us; five women and one man. He has been with the company for five years and I have been there one. As far as I know everyone has to follow the rules in the "company handbook". The one man in my department calls out sick frequently and has an unscheduled absence/  "sick day" at least once a week. He has been working four day work weeks since before the holidays and has always been unreliable. I was recently called into a meeting with our supervisor and told that I was receiving a verbal warning for being 1-2 minutes late four times in the month of January. There is a rule about being to work at 8:30 -5:30 and she told me that there is no leeway and that if I am even 30 seconds late, I am considered late by the owner, He tells us to be there at 8:30 but sets his clock in the lobby a few minutes fast...Another rule in the handbook is that you can not have more than 3 unscheduled absences in 90 days. I brought up the fact that the man in our department missed frequently and asked if he had been given a warning as well. She couldn't answer and started saying that maybe the man in our department had a special arrangement with the owner. I would think that as his supervisor, she would know if he had special treatment. I think getting in trouble for being 1-2 minutes late is rediculous and I also don't think that it is fair for the man in our department not to have to follow the same handbook rules. I know if I called in sick once a week I would have been fired by now. I feel like I have my own special set of strict rules in the office that no one else follows and like the owner is always trying to watch to catch me rule breaking. I don't understand why they are "picking on me" I am one of the lowest paid employees there. I want to tell them it seems like gender discrimination but I'm afraid that as soon as I bring up discrimination that they will find a way to fire me. How should I handle this?

When there, he would get up and nervously walk up to a table facing me, then before he would, he would about-face and sit back down. He did that a few times. What is up?

All my friends, and people all around always think that. And...I don't know...maybe they're right, because I'm bisexual, and none of my friends know that I am xD. So is that mostly true? Or just steriotype?   The whole point to this question is mostly the question asked above, but for one reason. 1.) I'm starting to like this guy in theater, and I don't know if he's that way or not. He's really quite since he's new, and he's like mostly around me since we're the only two guys out of 10 chicks in the class. Which is kind of nice xD. So yea, no hard feelings if the question is completely false. Just wanted to ask:D Please answer thanks!!!

20090131162914AApVDbJ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Want to change my gender-confusing first name ... what's your opinion?	I am 36 years old, so I know it's a little late to do this, but I have hated my name all my life.  I will tell you that I am a female and my first name is Trey.  What were my parents thinking?  It's a guys name and I hate it ... everything from being called "Mr. ... " at the doctor's office to cashiers looking at my credit card and then looking at me like "did you steal this from a guy named Trey?"  I know some of you might think it's cool, but try living a day in my shoes and I will tell you it's not fun.  My middle name is definitely feminine, but I'm not a big fan of being called that.  Now I am about to start a part-time career as a real estate agent (keeping my day job until market picks up) and your name in real estate is everything.  With meeting so many new people in this new field, I want to legally change my first name to Traci ... leaving my middle and last name (married name) in tact.  I figure that way, it's easy for people to remember beause it's so close to my current name (just adding "ci" to the end).  If friends or current co-workers forget and call me "Trey", it is short for Traci.  I know Traci in itself can be gender confusing too, but not nearly as much as Trey.  I have done a lot of name statistics research and "Traci", because it is spelled with an i at the end, is 100% female, according to name registrations.  Other variations like Tracy or Tracey could be either, but mostly female.  I like the name.  It's short, easy to say, and flows well with my middle and last names.  BTW ... I live in Maryland.  Know anyone else who has done this?  How easy will it be for friends to remember my new name?  Opinions anyone?

I slept in the tube tops and wore short shorts in the house because it was soooo hot   even with the    AC. This WAS  my house, my home. I never left the house in a tube top. How is it being wicked to wear short shorts in your home, door closed with a tube top.   I put on a duster if someone knocked.  I have not   had short short on since I quit biking years ago,   had hardly any clothes and it was hot as could be.   I would put on shorts and go running or biking.   How I long for those days. Merely a short 20 yrs since I was a runner. Merely four years since I started biking again, but had to quit.

20090131165908AAAJ4Df	Society & Culture;Languages	About trilingual family?	I want you imagine the situation. Father is Russian. Mother is Polish. They don't know each other's language well so they're talking in English. Native country's language is Polish. Daily when they have some business they're talking to people in their native languages.      I have heard that children should be taught in parents language. For example father should talk in Russian and mother should talk in Polish. But how to avoid the confuse if they will talk between each other in English? If children ask something mother in Russian she will not understand. In which language should be talking to child that parents will understand? English is not so popular in that country, but baby should be understood by both parents, who doesn't know each other native language. What should they do?

20090131183100AApjUta	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	I don't know why but my question didn't show up?	So i will ask here.      For the past two months I have been receiving late night phone calls from a with held number, when I would answer there was just a man breathing heavily and mumbling, I thought this was quite strange as I never give my phone number out.       Then earlier tonight I had a phone call from a withheld number, this time they spoke, they said "I want to f*ck your tight little c*nt", I didn't recognize the voice, And obviously I was quite shaken. I immediately hung up, but they persisted and called again. I then proceeded to just switch my phone off.       About a half out later, I put my phone on again to phone friend for a chat and to tell her about what had happened, when I saw I had a voicemail, It was the same man...   He said: "I want to f*ck you, I want to beat your little c*nt, I am going to f*ck you so hard, tight little p*ssy, Im going to f*ck you" Then there was heavy breathing (as though he was jerking off) and then and the end he said, "Im watching you all the time".      Obviously I am really shaken;      1. Is this sexual harassment?   2. If i go to the police can they track the number?   3. Will the police be able to press charges?         This is serious, so please no silly comments, I really need to know.

20090131180331AAz9aGy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: why should the government legislate morality?	why should the government legislate morality on topics such as abortion and gay marriage? and before you start quoting bible verses, hear me out first:      abortion: simply put, it is a personal choice that the woman makes for HERSELF, and HERSELF alone. the government should not govern what happens in a woman's womb. if she wants to have the baby, good for her! if she wants to abort it, too bad. before you say "thou shall not kill", note that not everyone's a christian and follows the bible. THEY aren't obliged to do so. and really, why should YOU care about some stranger. you don't even are about over 99% of the billions of children who ARE living. why should you care about those who don't even exist yet? and I don't believe in souls. I don't believe the "life begins at conception" stuff.      gay marriage: "it is against god": okay. according to your beliefs, it is against god. but what about people who are atheist or agnostic? they don't believe there's a god. they shouldn't have to be forced to live their lives according to the bible. "it is between a man and a woman": says who? the bible? see above. "it is unnatural": so are eyeglasses, A.I. and clothes (we are all born naked.... well, maybe not ALL of us).      if you don't like abortion, stay away from the clinics. if you don't like gay marriage (and homosexuals in general), then don't hang around them. you don't have to. live your OWN life according to YOUR beliefs. associate yourself with people who DO share your religion and beliefs. but don't infringe upon the lives of other people (who most likely don't share your religion or beliefs, and whom you don't know).      the government should:   1. NOT govern morality   2. NOT govern the PERSONAL lives of people.   3. maintain separation of church and state

20090131170022AAKY1V8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why does there have to be a God?	I have been wondering this for some time, is it something that along the line thousands of years ago we created the concept of God(s) so that we could feel like there was some form of purpose and what not?  Does believing that there is an Almighty watching over us allow us to feel better about our lives, and help us sleep at night?  What evidence is there even for a God?  I see all these people going after evolutionists on here for saying it is outrageous and whatnot, but at least they have some form of tangible evidence for what they believe.  I'm not trying to make people mad or anything, but why does there have to be a God?
20090131170850AAwNbHR	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Does this make sense to you?	This is based on an incident that happened in school.      On Monday, I had 4th period gym. During gym, a kid challenged me to basketball. I accepted. The score was 1-1. During the game, he was pushing me when I went to take a layup. At one point I was running full speed, driving up with the ball to take a layup and he full out kicked my shins. I fell to the ground directly on both of my knees. Since I was running really fast, that just put more strain on my knees. My gym teacher saw what happened and called the kid over to the side. My gym teacher spoke with the kid and asked my gym teacher asked me a couple of times if I was ok. I said I was ok. I told my gym teacher that I wanted to continue the game against the kid because I wanted to beat him. I couldn't walk properly and I couldn't run at all. I continued the game against the kid and I beat him 11-1. Gym ended like 5 minutes later. I went to the nurses office directly after. I told the nurse that I was kicked and I fell on my knees. I asked for an ice pack and they gave me two ice packs to use for my knees. I went to Chemistry class during 5th period. I didn't want to go to the Principal that period because I was learning something new in Chemistry. 6th period, I had to take an economics final so I didn't go that period either. 7th period, I had Advanced Computer Applications so I went to the main office that period. I asked to see the principal when I arrived there but he wasn't available. Instead, I spoke to one of the assistant principals. I told her that the kid intentionally kicked me while I was playing basketball and that I fell on my knees and that they were hurting. She asked me if I went to the nurse and I said yeah. She asked me if I wanted to go with her to the nurse again and I said no because I don't want to risk being sent home because I had more tests that day. I didn't tell her that I continued playing with the kid after I fell because I thought that was irrelevant information. She said that she will call the kid down and call his parents. That same day, I went to the emergency room because my knees were in too much pain later on. I was diagnosed with bilateral knee hematoma which means bone bruises in both knees. My dad spoke with the assistant principal and she said that she called the kid's parents and left a message on their phone. My dad spoke with my gym teacher on the phone and he explained everything to my dad. I didn't tell my dad about continuing to play with the kid, because once again, I thought it was irrelevant information. Today, the assistant principal calls my dad saying that they aren't going to do anything to the kid because the kid claims it to be an "accident," and because I continued to play with him. I only continued to play with him to beat him and get him off of my back for a while because all he does is annoy me everyday. Now, I can't walk properly and I can't run at all and the school isn't going to do anything to the kid. The kid claims it to be an "accident," but I have almost the entire gym as a witness as to what happened. Even some of the kid's supposed "friends" would probably vouch for me. So many people saw what happened and yet still nothing happens to the kid.      Shouldn't something happen to the kid? He should be suspended for intentional violence. The fact that I continued to play basketball shouldn't make any difference. That was all based on a sense of pride and an adrenaline rush. Of course I wouldn't feel the damage immediately. I would only feel it later on, which I did.      By the way, I am in high school. I am a junior and the kid that hurt me is a senior. We are in the same gym class.

20090131165314AAQZ0eJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians...what do you think about the new policy ?	This policy was passed by Obama to aid abortions in other countries...oh yea..at the expense of the USA.      "Dr. Walter Odhiambo, the country director for Marie Stopes Kenya, said his family planning organization had been limping along on European aid because of the U.S. rule on not supporting other countries on abortion issues. Obama overturned this policy on Jan. 23 in one of his first presidential acts. Now, Odhiambo said, he would be applying for U.S. funds he hoped to use to expand abortion counseling , particularly in rural Kenya."      The policy,  (under President Bush),  banned U.S. government money from going to international groups that either offer abortions or provide information, counseling or referrals about abortion. Its critics call it the "global gag rule," because it prohibits funding for groups that lobby to legalize abortion or promote it as a family planning method.          Christians.....abortions and contraceptives are against Gods will. The only acceptable form of birth control is abstinence. What are your views on this?      Im targeting answers from Christians only please....serious answers only.   Thank you and God Bless all of you.

20090131175416AAlufEz	Society & Culture;Etiquette	My son's pointing out skin color?	My son is 3, and has started pointing out what color skin people have. Our family is diverse--there are dark- and light-skinned members, and his best friends are from mixed backgrounds, so it's not an issue of race. He's simply saying "you have brown skin," "you have pink skin," etc.   I don't want him to do this at school and make his teachers or other kids uncomfortable, but he doesn't understand why he shouldn't do this.   What's a good way to discuss this with a 3-year old?

My aunt and uncle don't want to have a child and they are called selfish and horrible because of it. I think this is ridiculous. It is their choice. What's wrong with not wanting a child?      I was once even called a bad person for not wanting to have a child when I get older and I'm only 14! Also, why is "family" defined as a couple with a child? Why does having a child mean you have a family rather than you have a new family member?

20090131173843AA41UAp	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Are the following situations rude, or am I just over-sensitive?	I find the following situations rude. Am I over-sensitive like the people involved told me I am, or are they really rude?      - My friend asked me to call her. While we're on the phone, she starts checking her e mail and watching a movie. I have to keep repeating myself because she's distracted.      - I'm hungry after School so head over to a Sushi bar for something to eat. My friend is with me but doesn't have any money on her, so I buy her sushi (expensive). A few days later, the situation is reversed, but she doesn't buy me so much as a drink.      - Graduation is around the corner and everyone is planning celebratory holidays. I've planned to visit some old friends (attending a different HS) at one of their Aunt's apartments at the beach. Few weeks before, a couple of my other friend's plans fall through and they lose their hotel booking. They're pretty upset, so I adjust my plans to include them and they come along with us. Everyone gets along famously, until the second night...when they hear from their other friend who invites them to her apartment (3 hours away, but in the main party area). They leave right away - refusing to pay for costs we'd agreed on splitting.         I've found all of these situations hurtful and rude. In the last one, I told them how I felt, and they called me "needy" and "over-sensitive". Is that the case or are they rude?

Honestly he has all the looks and is better looking than me. He knows alot of girls and alot of girls want to know him. That just pisses me off cause i get jealous. Im very protective of him when he goes with other guys i also feel the anxiety of missing him. We spent alot of time with each other. when we watch movies he lies down on my shoulder and holds my hand when i get scared. That could mean that hes trying to stop my from covering my eyes or just simply wants to hold my hand. when our eyes meet we gaze into each others eyes soo deeply. We always look at each other. People are starting to notice something. Like when he leans on me. I also enjoy making him laugh and being with him. Im not sure of his sexuality and that's what bothers me. He is extremely handsome and a lot of gay guys in our school have crushes on him. he doesn't mind them and just minds me. We play alot of games that involve touching each other. They're my ideas and he does play along but i think he likes them too What should I do?

One morning when he noticed he wasn't in his room so he went looking for him and found him in the yard. He had been bitten by a snake and J started crying really hard about it...      His uncle died the day before, so that could have made it worse.      So for Valentine's Day I found this cute little stuffed Chihuahua that I was going to order him. I want to get a little collar to put on it and a dog tag that says "Stefano" and maybe "I love you J" under it or something...      But would that hurt him and make him sad, or would it be sweet?

20090131170604AAgPAFF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians--If an Indian Chief, who is a polygamist, wants to "get saved," what does he do with his wives?	So I'm reading about this history of Marcus and Narcissa Whitman, and they ran into the issue of Indians that were polygamists. The Whitmans argued that the Indians, once saved, had the duty to get rid of all wives but one.      That leads me to the question--what is the proper response of the Christian to a polygamist who wants to repent and trust in Jesus? Does the polygamist divorce all his wives but one, kicking them to the proverbial curb? Or does he continue living as a polygamist, which is something that's also frowned upon by Scripture?

(If a person was under the Mosaic Law and was judged guilty of profaning the Sabbath, he was to be stoned to death by the whole congregation, according to Exodus 31:14 and Numbers 15:32-35. Many who argue for sabbath keeping have reason to be glad that we are not under that Law. As shown in the scripture here quoted, an approved standing with God no longer requires observance of the sabbath requirement given to Israel.)

20090131194111AAamOcI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To those who believe in a global flood...?	Specifically, I'm addressing the Young-Earth Creationists. I was reading Genesis earlier and noticed that God creates the river Euphrates near Eden:    Genesis 2: 14 "The name of the third river is Tigris; it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates."    This was obviously before the Flood of Noah, but well after the Flood the river is mentioned again and again. Here's one example:    Genesis 15:18 "On the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying: "To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River Euphrates"    Now, how could a flood with enough force to create the Grand Canyon and the Green River Formation possibly leave the Euphrates untouched? Even if another river that appeared after the flood was given the same name, why is it in the same exact place? This makes no sense to me.    P.S. For the record, I am a Christian. But, I'm a rational one.
20090131192549AAYnUBs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, I have a few questions...?	1.)

If God/Jesus loves me, why does he want me to go through all this crap in life, THEN burn in hell for my sins?      4.) But since we are all sinners and Jesus died for our sins, does it really matter what we do? We will all be saved, especially if we repent right before we die.      5.) Why do you continue to call yourself christians when you really aren't true to the word of God (or man..), and you are really closer to Satanic?

20090131204619AARC1nD	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the connection between atheism and morality? ?	I'm guessing the so called fundies are going to say that atheists also deny the existence of ethics and morality, and I'm going to also guess that the atheist nutbars will agree with that. I'm asking rational people of both persuasions the question; certainly atheists agree that ethics and morality are important, that they might even be close to being universal in nature. What then would have been the source of that premise? (an honest question seeking an honest answer, not a dig, or a rant. I have traced western concepts of morality only back as far as Plato who's main character, Socrates claimed to believe in a higher power but who also claimed an unfailing belief in logic).

20090131192704AAmEAMF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can you worship a God who has designed such a world as this?	I am well aware that many religious people accept that God cannot intervene on wordly matters, so as to leave human beings "in charge" of our own destinies.  But in the cases of people born physically deformed, or into an impoverished part of the world beset by famine, war or drought, how can this possibly be fair?      There are animals who, through natural design, are compelled to hunt, kill and eat whatever prey they can find. The Leopard Seal, for example, will eat penguins if available.  Small penguins it can gobble whole, larger ones it has to physically slam against the water surface many times, until the penguin's body is completely shattered and it slowly dies an agonizing death.  Similar predation occurs when the crocodile drags prey beneath the water, slowly suffocating the unfortunate beast to a prolonged and painful death.  The Indian wild dog, if hungry enough, will chase its prey for many miles, until, totally exhausted, the victim may be disembowelled while still living, and slowly skinned alive.   I want religious people to explain how their God, who supposedly "designed" all this, is worth worshipping, in the face of such barbarity.  If your answer is that God is powerless to intervene, this surely renders Him unworthy of worship. Saying "He works in mysterious ways," or "it is a mystery," carries little water.    If you can recite the Lord's Prayer or the Palms while watching a Youtube video of a rabbit being slowly swallowed alive by a snake, please explain how.        Thank you and God bless.

20090226090143AAqXnDs	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is god himself an atheist?	Lets first get a working definition. atheist: noun, One who denies the existence of God.   (Since this definition is based on the Western concept of monotheism, we might expand it to include the Hindu religion or one who denies the existence of any gods.)      What is clear from the growth of the theological tradition in the Biblical text is that the early God of the Hebrews was one of many Semitic gods found in the pantheon usually located atop a high mountain peaks such as the Biblical Sinai or Horeb and it is within this polytheistic society that the first Commandment of Exodus 20 was written.      [An Excursion: The Evolution of “God” in the LXX: A Note on Genesis 1:1      In the early epic cycles in the Hebrew Bible, not only in J and E in in Genesis and Exodus, but as redacted in the Tribal League epics in the Deuteronomistic History of the Tetratuch, the concept of the deity of the Hebrews / Israelites moves from a local god who is but one member of a pantheon of gods which create the world (????) for his people which he rules over to a latter universal single monotheistic deity of the LXX drawn from the Classical Greek concept of θε??.      Genesis 1: 1            This plural form of god is emended in the Old Greek and carried in to the LXX as:   εν αρχη εποιησεν ο θεο? τον ουρανον και την γην      (Note: ????? the plural masculine of ?? or singular for god (see: Marvin Pope excellent comments in his classical study: El in the Ugaritic Text, EJ Brill 1955; pp. 1 - 21 and for a more up to date study see: John Day, Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan (Sheffield Academic Press, 2000)      Genesis 1: 1 clearly states that the world of the Hebrews was formed by a polytheistic assembly of gods just as one would expect in the Semitic cuneiform text of the ancient Near East such as the Enuma Elish.      How in the hell does ?????with ????equal κ?ριο? ? θε??? I would emphatically state that during Israel’s evolution from polytheism to monotheism has totally eclipsed the Semitic etymology here in favor of the non-Semitic Greek. ]      Since Yahweh demands the Hebrews / Israelites put him first over all the other gods (Please note: Nowhere does Yahweh say these other gods don’t exist, but rather that only he alone wants to be their god-king). Thus, it is plainly obvious that Yahweh himself believes in other gods just a these other gods also believed in him or (to put it another way; Yahweh is not an atheist). Thus, under Josiah’s reforms, all other Beth El’s or other Houses of Gods must be destroyed thus cutting off their food and leaving only Israel’s leading god’s (Yahweh) temple in Jerusalem alone honored with sacrifices.      In conclusion, when we come to the LXX and the New Testament (which is based on the LXX) we do not find Yahweh as simply another god fearing other deities of the Israelites anymore (or even the name Yahweh itself), but an alone and the only real Theos who himself no longer believes in any other living deities, but considers all other forms of competing gods simply worthless and dead idols (See the atheistic theologies to wards other gods in the Acts of the Apostles and St. Paul’s theology). Put another way, the Theos of the New Testament is now fully an atheist when it comes to belief in any god or gods!      Here a some closing questions to consider:      A. When did Yahweh lose his faith / belief in other Gods?      B. Why does the atheistic Theos (θε??) feel that the religious belief of the Semitic Yahweh was wrong?      C. Does the atheistic Greek Theos even deny the ancient Semitic, but religious   (faithfully believing) Yahweh himself?      D. Can the Biblical text reconcile the atheistic Theos with Yahweh’s faith in other gods? (Can the LXX and its later sibling (the New Testament) ever be really reconciled with the MT text? As I have already pointed out, to say that ????? ???? equals κ?ριο? ? θε?? is simply etymologically apologetic crap!)

20090131195544AAovRlW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Homosexuality...          ?	How is homosexuality an abomination?      Seriously, let's use some logic here. How is a sexual orientation worse than murder, rape, theft, etc.?      Take note this is from the American PSYCHOLOGICAL Association.      "Is Sexual Orientation a Choice?      No, human beings cannot choose to be either gay or straight. For most people, sexual orientation emerges in early adolescence without any prior sexual experience. Although we can choose whether to act on our feelings, psychologists do not consider sexual orientation to be a conscious choice that can be voluntarily changed.      Can Therapy Change Sexual Orientation?      No; even though most homosexuals live successful, happy lives, some homosexual or bisexual people may seek to change their sexual orientation through therapy, often coerced by family members or religious groups to try and do so. The reality is that homosexuality is not an illness. It does not require treatment and is not changeable. However, not all gay, lesbian, and bisexual people who seek assistance from a mental health professional want to change their sexual orientation. Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people may seek psychological help with the coming out process or for strategies to deal with prejudice, but most go into therapy for the same reasons and life issues that bring straight people to mental health professionals.      What About So-Called "Conversion Therapies"?      Some therapists who undertake so-called conversion therapy report that they have been able to change their clients' sexual orientation from homosexual to heterosexual. Close scrutiny of these reports, however. show several factors that cast doubt on their claims. For example, many of these claims come from organizations with an ideological perspective that condemns homosexuality. Furthermore, their claims are poorly documented; for example, treatment outcome is not followed and reported over time, as would be the standard to test the validity of any mental health intervention.      The American Psychological Association is concerned about such therapies and their potential harm to patients. In 1997, the Association's Council of Representatives passed a resolution reaffirming psychology's opposition to homophobia in treatment and spelling out a client's right to unbiased treatment and self-determination. Any person who enters into therapy to deal with issues of sexual orientation has a right to expect that such therapy will take place in a professionally neutral environment, without any social bias."       http://www.apahelpcenter.org/articles/ar...                How about for once you use your human emotions and logic instead of letting a book control you thoughts?

Is it possible that this whole thing about not letting gays marry and have equal rights, like they should in this modern world, is just a religion war?   You have ppl throwing the Bible out to their defense, quoting scripture and telling gays not sin and to pray to get better.   When in reality it is who they are.    They are conviently bringing the Bible up when most of our population has premarital sex, which is also a sin according to the Bible. But that's not against the law!   So I'm asking you, is this really all about religion? The Bible? Is that what gays are up against to marry the person they love that just so happens to be the same sex?    Even if they may be a different religion or they could be a Christian, they have to abide by the Bible?    What are your thoughts?   Is there a religion war?   Is it right?   Is it wrong?

Why do some say it isn't God's fault, but rather the gay person's fault, claiming that they are choosing that lifestyle?    I don't believe that they can choose who they are. They are who they are. And God made them that way. Because he doesnt make mistakes.    But what is your take on this?

I'm that guy. There hasn't been a single guy in real life that I've been sexually attracted to or gave me butterflies in my stomach like every single cute girl with a cutsy personality does.      I've watched what turns me on or captures my attention pretty closely. Like for example, whenever I go to the mall, I always notice the cute girls and enjoy what I see. I never care for the guys. Masculinity is boring to me in real life. But in porn, watching two horny guys showing sexual affection turns me on. (I like straight, les, and otehr porn as well)      Everyone says I am bisexual because of this. My question to you is, if I'm bisexual, where is the real life physical evidence of it, not just visual turn on's from porn? Shouldn't I have at least found one guy by now that I find incredibly sexually appealing in real life if I'm bisexual?       If people are right, and me liking gay porn makes me bi, I just want to see the physical evidence of it. Why has no man turned me on in real life? Ever?

Wouldn't it all boil down to which stories they preferred?

20090131195858AAaXEwc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think the aborted person raises up from the dead on resurrection day?	I was just thinking that on resurrection day, we raise up a new flesh & bone similar to how we look (only better than ever).    But an aborted person never gets a chance to grow a body.    2. So do you think they will be part of the first resurrection then?    3. Do you think that this is something that was stolen from them?    I am sure it is nice to be in heavens orphanage & everything. But maybe it is important to have a time to mature & grow as a human.    So do you think that these aborted persons may raise up as children? While those who matured in Christ will be taller...?

For me, being recently divorced, I felt very bitter and cold over the way it ended. It was a mutual decision but it was upsetting to say the least.   The door closed.      Then a door that I never imagined in my wildest dreams opened for me. A woman whom I was best friends with from my past and had very strong feelings for appears. I thought she never cared about me, I thought we would never run into each other again. I loved this woman so much but I made some mistakes in the past, which she has forgiven me for. We now have a very good relationship and I am hoping for more. A door has been opened for me, when the other one closed.

20090131192223AAlldf0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Astrology and Christianity? What'z Up Christians? Explain.?	I have been studying the word of God and I happen to believe that astrology has some relevance to the Holy Scriptures and everyday people. I don't run to read the daily horoscopes in newspapers and magazines and i don't pick up my phone or cell to call soothsayers like "cleo". However i do believe that there is a element of truth in astrology. No one should use the sign they are born under as an excuse to say "that's just how i am."  We all have a free will as humans and can change. My question is, what are the chances that the magi who used the star to find Jesus the Christ weren't astrologers and what are the chances that the 12 apostles don't represent the 12 zodiac signs? and what are the chances that Ezekiel (chapter 1)wasn't using the zodiac animals as a description of the creatures he saw in a vision? How much is the church not telling us because of fear that people will know the true truth? Can somebody, anybody intelligent explain? WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

20090131190522AAaWgNW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think I have faith in something?	A few people not too long ago, said I don't believe in God, because I don't believe Jesus is my Lord and savior. I see Jesus as a spiritual teacher, that guids us in our lives, but I also believe we are responsible for our own sins and it's up to us to fix them our selves. I also don't believe in one true religion. I see each religion holds a piece of the truth, but none have the complete or even close to the whole truth.       I also tell people I don't read the bible or go by any holy text. I don't read much of the bible, because I notice if you take a lot of the information out of the book and translate it out of the outlandish text, most of the stuff in there is common sense, so I don't see the whole point of reading it.      Some people also think I don't believe in God, because I have respect for atheist. I told one preacher, that God loves atheist, just like he loves everbody else and he seemed to get offened. I may not agree 100% of their thinking, but that doesn't mean I should show hate towards them. Does this look like I have no faith?

She fell asleep for an hour or two, and eventually it was 1 AM. Neither of my roommates were in there. She hadn't gotten much sleep the other night and was extremely tired. I tried to wake her up so she could go back to her room to sleep. I know that seems kinda cruel, but I didn't want to sleep in the same bed as her, and plus she had told me earlier she was going to take a 1 hour nap and that I should wake her up at 12. Of course she didn't want to wake up!! See, this  has happened before where I let her sleep in my room for the night and she'd get extremely angry at me and rebuke me for allowing such a thing to happen.      I eventually did wake her up and walked her back to her dorm, but she was outraged at me. She angrily told me to get the heck out of her room basically.      Well anyways, this morning I texted her asking her how she was feeling. No answer. A few hours later I texted her asking if she was going to talk to me at all today and she replied simply NO. I feel so bad :( I thought I was doing the right thing? I couldn't sleep in my roommates beds cause they eventually came back that night. I didn't want to sleep in the same bed as her cause well...it wasn't right! Help? :(

When the soft white clouds were still within reach, when the world knew not of lonesome winters, before Earth has learned the weight of men, that was when we met. Thou picked me up- not more then a nestling. The down and fluff though shaped into wings and taught me to soar. At the sight of thee, the bitter winds turn into a gentle breeze that softly whispers my thoughts: how did I ever live without thou? For thou have taught me what happiness is, shown me the true meaning of passion. How foolish I was to believe that only in a young girl’s dream is it possible to find my knight on a white horse, the man of my dreams. And now, here in thy arms, my rationality and sense of reason seems to be leaving me and the thought seeps into my mind: could the phrase amor vincit omnia be possible?    Can thou not here it in my silence: I will stay with thou forever. I am letting my heart silence my head. Even if I won’t be next to thou, I will always be thine.

Any answer is fine, but I prefer if you answer the financial cost of it; Variable and Fixed cost, what commitment I have to make, and how much money will it cost me each day, week, month, year, etc. Even the benefits and consequences, are fine too. Right now I have no experience of building a school so include every bit of knowledge that you can offer me. Please note that I already know that there are organizations that could do that which will make my life a lot easier but when you do it yourself you will feel a sense of accomplishment. Also I want to inspire many people because many people I know do not think it is possible to tackle this huge project. Thank you.

20090131144227AAlTrdV	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is having doubts about your atheism or religion a weakness?	I'm an atheist and I haven't doubted my views for many years.   But sometimes I feel this is not a sign of strength but more the opposite. Maybe a lack of imagination too...      It seems that at some moment in your life you turn to a specific insight and just stay there frozen.       What I see as 'truth' seems very obvious but I can see that other people with different views have the same experience.      What are your views on this?

Well my best friend is black and she got all annoyed, and she said;   "F.u.c.k her little white a.s.s bi.t.ch up"    I said I found that pretty offensive as what I were to say "Little Black as.s Bi.t.ch"... I would be called racist...    My best friend claimed that black people can't be racist and that you cant be racist to a white person because we aren't a minority... but I didn't think it was about wether your a minority or not....   was she racist in saying what she said????

20090226090903AAZ1nS4	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Don't you think if some of these angry people knew how many poor people have kids they'd leave Octomom alone?	I think if some of these angry people knew how many poor single women have like 6-8 kids everyday in poor neighborhoods and then are abandoned by their lovers (the kid's father) they would STOP treating the Octomom's situation as unique and reprehensible. They would shut up just because she doesn't fit the 2.5 kids ideal for Americans. When one woman had septuplets a few years ago no one said anything. It was on the news but it was praised. People gotta realize there is more to life then money. People are going to struggle but if they are making an effort and trying that is what counts. You can give a child the world and they'll be spoiled and thankless or you can give a child all you have no matter how small and they'll be appreciative and loyal. It depends on the person so all these mad people need to chill out and focus on what affects their lives like bills and gas, you know? Focus on what you gonna feed yourself tonight for dinner instead of griping about how Nadya going to care for all her kids. Just because a mom doesn't have money doesn't mean she can't love them with all her heart and she has her mom. If this Octomom stuff happened in like the ghetto of Detroit or something no one would have said anything. It is just sad that mothers (healthy mothers who care) are just not appreciated or respected for doing all they can to raise their children (even if they do have lots of kids). Instead they are painted the same as a woman on crack who lives in the projects in some cramped apartment and doesn't care about herself and lets her kids starve and cry all through the night. I doubt Nadya is that kind of woman but unfortunately it doesn't look like good intentions counts for anything these days if the situation looks grim from the start and bad stuff can still happen regardless.
