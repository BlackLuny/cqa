IEVMRGjeaa	I think reading will really help you expand your vocal skills and understand the importance of sentence structure.<br>  Another thing I would advise it to watch some speeches, like on Youtube.<br>  Also, go listen to some lectures. If you live in a city that has a lot of lecturers come in and talk (about anything), that's a really good exercise. Also, debating with your friends about politics/arts or anything that interests you is good.<br>  Finally, authors often tour cities and give readings of their books, that could be another way.|`|AA11887983	Try to talk more in other parts of your life.  It isn't how much you talk, it is what you say.  If you don't have something to say, don't just yak to make noise.  <br>  <br>  Also, instead of texting or emailing friends, try to talk to them more.  <br>  <br>  If you are interested in becoming more involved in conversations, then you first have to learn to listen.

Reading a lot will definitely help your vocabulary skills and, in most cases, it WILL help you know what's going on more, but as for speaking, in my case, at least, Reading hasn't helped. If you counted (per sentence) the number of 'um's and 'uh's in my sentences, you would run out of fingers and toes from the hundred people around you!

If not, you would get a +. <br>  If you distribute, you will find this answer to be correct.<br>  (x - b)(x + b)<br>  distribute and it will be<br>  xsquared + bx - bx -bsquared<br>  the bx cancels with -bx leaving you with the original.<br>  x(squared)-b(squared)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  y= 2x squared -5x+2<br>  <br>  To find the intercept of x, set y to zero and vice versa. Since you are looking for x-intercept, set y to zero. Why? Becuase think of the ordered pair ofn intercept. It will be (0,y) or (x,0)<br>  So set y to zero:<br>  0=2xsquared - 5x+2<br>   To solve this you must factor. First rule of factoring- the coefficient of the xsquared must be one. to get it from 2xsquared to just one, mulitply the 2 to the other two (the number addded at the end.) You will divide later to get it all back and even, but you MUST NOT FORGET that if you multiply that two, you must undo it later by dividing. So you multiply and get:<br>  x-squared-5x+4<br>  <br>  Find the factors of four.<br>  1 x 4<br>  2 x 2<br>  Which ones when you add (because it is +4 not -4) will give you five? (because of -5x + 4). This would be one and four.<br>  so put the x and the one and four<br>  (x _ 4) (x _ 1) <br>  Now do you subtract or add?<br>   Look at the equation and it will tell you.

If the students sit around in a circle reviewing a lesson, they drift of and stop paying attention.

AA11962853	Study tips: study while you are at the gym on the treadmill or bicycle or during breaks. This will leave you more time to sleep or relax later on during the day or night. Rest is not the same as relaxation and it sounds like you'll need both. Do your work during the week so that you can have majority of your weekends free. If you go back over your notes on a daily basis, it will cut down the amount of time you need to take studying.<br>  <br>  As far as lectures go; we know they are boring. The best way to combat that is to not let your head go to close to your notebook or paper or whatnot. Take many notes, this will help you stay awake if you become too overwhelmed.<br>  <br>  Other tips that might help you is to stay focused as much as possible, it sounds like you might already take care of yourself physically, so keep that up with exercise and a healthy diet, take time for YOU on occasion even if it's for just five minutes a day, try to balance your time between studying and what I like to call "hobby time," and if you find you are getting a little too stressed out, just take a few moments to unwind and get some comedy in your life. This will re-energize you and give you another start.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

Just make sure you get some sort of work experience by working in sale or some sort of customer service job. Actually, I did meet an accountant who got a degree in  accounting who worked at the bank. Her job was to advise people about their financial future not count money behind the window. Go to the link below to learn more about the role of an accountant. You can make like 100K  and up /year, if you know how to use that degree. A great way to start your accountant career is to get a job as a bank teller while in college.

Adoption is another choice, but if all teen girls get pregnant, deliver, and then give up the babies, we're going to have a ton of babies that don't have homes and will end up in foster care.

SwG2PJTNaa	"Lance Armstrong surviving cancer represents a prime example of how the hope of one man can inspire many."|`|NrkWd4Aoaa	Lance Armstrong's survival of cancer is an example that inspires hope.|`|Wp23aaLQaa	That's not even a sentence and its hard to tell anyways without reading the essay.|`|aQQYEZNAaa	Hope does not exist. All hope is is a self disillusionment in relying on something to fix its self Which simply does not happen. There is always circumstances that determine the outcome of any situation.
bynqfZaBaa	It doesn't seem bad except for that comma right there. I wouldn't quite put it like that because the whole point of thesis statement is to grab a reader and get them to continue reading. This can be done by perhaps by starting with a question like. What fills your heart with more inspiration than that of Lance Armstrong and his battle with cancer?<br>  something catchy and awesome :)|`|TbSam3FCaa	It's a good start.

Explain the reasons he's an inspiration of hope.<br>  <br>  "Once acknowledging Lance Armstrong as a succesful career man, yet a tenacious fighter against cancer one realizes that Lance Armstrong is a prime example of inspiration and hope."<br>  <br>  you would only do that if those were the two things you were going to discuss.<br>  - his career<br>  -fight against cancer<br>  <br>  <br>  your thesis should break down your paper into parts. telling what it is comprised of.|`|gNdHLgghaa	The usual thesis statement in an essay is a sentence which contains your three main ideas you plan to write about.<br>  <br>  "Some of the things that hastened the development of modern America were immigration, new technology, and more widespread trade opportunities."<br>  <br>  That's one example of a thesis.  This is irrelevant if you're not trying to write an essay.|`|c0f589cc82e755866e7f0bc187673f86aa	No. You should say something like, "Although some people question the integrity of Lance Armstrong, his survival from cancer has proved to be a prime example of hope." <br>  <br>  Something like that... <br>  <br>  I hope that helped...|`|gw0CVURCaa	yes it is a good statement, cause he had alot of faith to beat  the cancer, and family to be with him and help him beat the cancer. yes it was all hope and god.|`|xBPIDaDPaa	YES! you go girl.

oH07ZxOUaa	I answered this question elsewhere on the site, but I think you should continue. Where in the US do you live? I worked as a SLP for the past 8 years in Tampa, NYC, and Toronto and never had problems finding a job. Even though I only did one year in the school system, I find that American school systems are begging for therapists. If you don't want to directly work for a school, you could try Progressus or other agencies that focus on the school setting. Also, you can look online at www.asha.org (if you're a member of NSSHLA) and see the jobs available. As for the salaries of working as a school SLP, I have friends in Chicago, FL, and NYC who make 60-70k, but they do have high caseloads and lots of meetings|`|ICeSfYSzaa	I say Deaf Ed, but i'm a little biased.<br>  :3<br>  You can help a lot more kids by learning sign and teaching with it.|`|I8XndwVtaa	Well, not all speech therapists work for school districts. Hospitals hire them, and I'm nearly certain that Deaf Schools hire them as well. I don't think I would change your major, but I might add Deaf Education as a minor. This would expand your job options. You would be qualified to do both things, and I wouldn't assume that you'd have to take all that many extra courses.
oH07ZxOUaa	Hi. The previous writer is incorrect and speech pathologists are in high demand. For a more detailed response, please review what I wrote. It's on the page with your other question.|`|AA11962853	There is so much you could do with both of those degrees. Yes, it is difficult to find employment as a speech pathologist. In fact, everything you said is, indeed, true. <br>  <br>  What about international programs? What about employment in areas outside of public school/private school? What about becoming a translator? What about applying for a masters degree program? Several universities offer great programs.<br>  <br>  These are only a few options that I could come up with off the top of my head. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
oH07ZxOUaa	Hi, I think you need to stay the course. You didn't specify where you live, but I worked as a SLP for the past 8 years in Tampa, NYC, and Toronto and never had problems finding a job. Even though I only did one year in the school system, I find that American school systems are begging for therapists. I've only worked in urban settings, so this may be different in a rural setting, but most schools will even provide you with a sign on bonus. If you don't want to directly work for a school, you could try Progressus or other agencies that focus on the school setting. Also, you can look online at www.asha.org (if you're a member of NSSHLA) and see the jobs available. As for the salaries of working as a school SLP, I have friends in Chicago, FL, and NYC who make 60-70k, but they do have high caseloads.|`|hfDohxp5aa	I'm a retired elem teacher in So. OR and yes, one speech teacher, and they stay until they retire. Is there an alternative job you can get if you can't get with a school right away ? They don't hire more deaf teachers than speech teachers tho ??|`|785352f029ac6e79c6c9b6356094e256aa	My wife is a SLP and and i have never seen someone get so many job offers in my life. She can either work in the hospitals, schools, or private home health care. There is a shortage of SLP in the schools because of the pay. SLP get paid teacher scale with a Master's degree. Starting off around 40k.She spent a year in the public schools and hated it for a couple of reasons. The school would over load her case load. The state mandates a caseload of 50 students(Michigan), and she was at 70-80 students for the first hal of the year. The district would not  hire another full-time SLP, so they contracted one to help make up the difference. The contracted SLP would make more working part time, with less kids than my full time wife. My wife quit the schools and now contracts herself out to charter schools and made 75K+ last year. She loves it. You will have no problem finding a job in public schools, especially with the new Special Ed. requirements most districts have now. Just expect to get paid like a teacher. Look into contracting yourself out to charter schools on an hourly bases. 80-100 bucks an hour.Good luck|`|hnUhuKD5aa	It may very well be difficult to land a job in a school working with children.  However, there are a few things to keep in mind.  First of all, the demand for for SLPs is everywhere - if there isn't an opening where you live, look somewhere else.  Second, working with children may not just mean a school district.  I am a speech therapist and work with preschool children in a private agency.  I work in the classroom setting and plan therapy just the same as working in a regular school. However, the kids are a ton more fun!   As for being a deaf Ed teacher, I feel this is considerably more difficult.  First, it would involve learning ASL fluently if you don't already know it.  Second, there is not as much of a demand for deaf ed teachers as there is for SLPs.

An Associates degree is general ed only (big whoop), a Bachelors degree is 2 years of what you want to study, and a Masters degree is around 4-6 years of what you want to study.
nzKGyadWaa	High School and Jr High only ('65-'69).  Champaign IL. I went to a Catholic school up till then that was predominately Irish American (the minorities were the French and German Americans). Champaign at that time was not integrated so bussing was used in the public schools. The black athletes were very respected. Otherwise there was a huge culture gap. With the exception of 2 kids, the blacks hung out with the blacks and the whites with the whites. There was a lot of antagonism on both sides. Many of us didn't feel antagonistic, but those that did made it hard for everyone else. I was bullied by one black girl trying to show off to her friends - bullied simply because I was very shy and it was safe to bully me - but I didn't figure that out until I was an adult. Bullies are bullies no matter what race they are. One black girl, Connie Fitzgerald, was really smart, smarter than most of us, and I think she was respected by people from both races. She ran with the "in crowd" - not the cheerleader snob "in crowd" but the smart WASP kids "in crowd".  I still laugh at the expressions of some of the white kids when she wore green for St. Pat's Day. When someone teased her she pointed out her grandfather was Irish which made her more Irish than most of the white kids in that class. My sister and I didn't hang out with many people period (too shy and lived out of town in a small town that was prejudiced against my family because we were Catholic. We pretty much kept  to ourselves.) My father had a small construction business and he hired blacks and whites indiscrimately. His foreman was black. Archie and his family would sometimes come to visit us. People would line the streets of that horrid little town to stare when they drove in. In summer school, when my sister took Driver's Ed, one kid wouldn't have been able to come to school because the busses didn't run and his mother didn't have a car. So every day Archie would pick up my sister and Eddie, the kid who needed a ride. Janie would sit between a large black man and a small black teen in a car, and listen to the language people would yell at them.(Later, in college, her roommate was black and because Janie and Portia hung out together, she was called "****** lover" and Portia was shunned by the black community.)  The worst day I remember was the day after Martin Luther King was killed. Most of the blacks didn't come to school that day. Connie Fitzgerald did. I remember the fear in her eyes and how nasty some students were. I had never suspected them of being capable of being that hateful. After we graduated, in the next few years, there were race riots in the high school which had a tendency to suck up any young male of any race into the melee. So while conditions were continually tense while I was in school, it got worse for several years afterwards. <br>  <br>  In college my sister dated blacks and whites both and many students from other countries, including India.  For a while she dated our High School Spanish teacher who was black. Although she was out of High School by then, I was more shocked at her dating a former teacher than at dating a black man.  I dated interacially too - but was seriously dating a Japanese American for 2 years. It wasn't until years later that I realized how our parents had to reevaluate their own convictions - that races should live together but not mate - because of the conduct of their daughters. I'm very proud of them. That was not easy, esp. for Dad who had fought in the Pacific during WW2. <br>  Integration was a very hard thing to live through for almost everyone in my generation. But it was very necessary. I still see so much prejudice - much of it based on mutual distrust, esp. in the WW2 generation. But I also see integrated neighborhoods, and a lot less ignorance and lasting friendships that ignore or even better celebrate differences in color. And that wouldn't have happened without the 60's.<br>  <br>  A few years ago Archie's son-in-law drove Archie to Dad's old house. We were gutting it at the time to sell it. Dad wasn't able to live alone any more, nor was Archie.  Archie and Dad sat side by side under the trees, two dying old men, surrounded by families that loved them, basking in a friendship that had lasted over 50 years.  It is a memory that brings me happiness every time I picture it. No walls. Just mutual respect and love. Isn't that what it's all about?|`|ig0miCndaa	yes, kids of color were in my grade, but none of them were my friends. It was the first year of integration in Maryland, so they were not treated respectfully, they were just sort of ignored. Integration was too long in coming, and definitely a good thing. My algebra teacher was Black--only one in school

Uslwk9IQaa	Well it looks like the deadline to apply for 2009-2010 is Friday, March 13, 2009. So I would have to imagine they would announce the winners within a few weeks after that, maybe a month after at the most.<br>  <br>  Most schools start sending their letters in April and usually give you some time after that to decide. I'm also sure SFSU knows when all other colleges are sending out letters and wouldn't do it after these elite level of students have already been accepted to other schools. Part of the reason they are doing this I'm sure is to keep stellar students going to their school. <br>  <br>  I think you will be fine to wait. And if worst comes to worst, deal with the decision once it's in front of you with all the deadlines laid out. Otherwise you might worry yourself sick and not enjoy the last few months of being a high school senior.<br>  <br>  It sounds like a great program and SFSU is a great school, in the middle of an amazing city. If you are lucky enough to get this scholarship it would be an amazing opportunity. You can also check out some photos of the campus here to see what it's all about: <a href="http://www.stuvu.com/colleges/san-francisco-state-university/photos" rel="nofollow">http://www.stuvu.com/colleges/san-franci...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|eFQXl7uyaa	Notice information should be on the mailing.

So f(x)= 3x- 8 is exactly the same as y = 3x- 8.<br>  <br>  To write the equation of a line you need to know two things, its slope and its y-intercept. You know that your line is parallel to y = 3x- 8.<br>  If two lines are parallel, then the always have the same slope. The slope of y = 3x- 8 is 3. So, the slope of the new line is also 3.<br>  <br>  Now to find the y-intercept you can substitute the slope, 3, and the x and y coordinates of the given point, (5, 8) into slope-intercept form, y = mx + b, and solve for b.<br>  y = mx + b<br>  8 = (3)(5) + b [substitute 5 for x, 8 for y, and 3 for m]<br>  8 = 15 + b [multiply]<br>  b = -7 [subtract 15 from each side]<br>  <br>  Now you know that slope is 3, so m = 3 and y-interecept is -7, so b = -7. Substitute m and b back into slope-intercept form, but leave x and y as x and y this time (don't substitute 5 and 8 again).<br>  y = mx + b<br>  y = 3x + (-7)<br>  y = 3x - 7<br>  <br>  And you can change y back to f(x).<br>  f(x) = 3x - 7 THAT'S THE ANSWER!<br>  <br>  Check it by seeing if it is parallel to f(x)= 3x- 8 and if it passes through 5,8).<br>  -it is parallel to f(x)= 3x- 8 because both slopes are 3<br>  -substitute to see if it passes through (5, 8).

If I had extra time, I wanted to go back over the questions I was unsure of, or to just make sure I didn't answer one stupid, or leave one blank.  Didn't bother me at all.  I also taught all my kids to do the same thing.  To stay, use all the time given, do the extra credit.  They say they aren't embarassed to be the last ones to turn their test in.  We don't think the last person to turn in a test would be considered stupid.  We think they are smart, thoughtful, concerned with their grade,  trying their best.  Sometimes when a teacher is subjective and gives partial credit they will decide to give you partial credit because they noticed how hard you tried.   <br>  <br>  Where are you in a rush to go?  Are your friends waiting for you?  I would tell my friends not to wait for me.  That would add to the stress.<br>  <br>  The fact that you have to read a question a few times is ok too.  It's better that you read it again versus misunderstanding what is being asked.  There's nothing wrong with you.

Online teaching jobs would not only free you from shouting in the classroom but also offers an opportunity to work from the comfort of your home for most of the time. Some online colleges and e- learning portals may however require you to meet students personally occasionally. <br>  <br>  As this is not a regular feature, online teaching jobs generally free one from all the hassles of traveling long distances for reaching the workplace. Thus, online education is not only bridging the distance and making learning comfortable, but also making online teaching jobs more attractive.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The spread of online education in Western countries have increased the demand of online teachers not only for online colleges and online universities, but also for online tutors.

0U6fSHGOaa	ans 1)There are no advantages of disadvantages to parallel or series circuits in general. They are just different. Each has its own characteristics which may be advantageous or disadvantageous depending on the circumstances.<br>  <br>  For example, in a series connection, the same current goes through all the elements. If these elements are old fashion low voltage Christmas lights, then the fact that one one lamp goes out the whole string goes dark is a major disadvantage. If these are LEDs which almost never go out, that isn't a problem, but the fact that you can use a high voltage source without converting to a lower voltage is a major benefit. Almost all Christmas lights now use high voltage bulbs wired in parallel, but LED flashlights all use LEDs in series.<br>  <br>  Elements connected in parallel all see the same voltage. This is not a problem when th elements can tolerate voltage variations, but is a problem when they can't. Thus light bulbs in parallel work well. Batteries in parallel don't work as well because each battery really wants a slightly different voltage. If they were forced to have the same, the current would not be evenly balanced. (You can connect batteries in parallel but it takes extra care. That's why flashlights, etc. always use batteries in series.)<br>  <br>  When elements are in parallel, you can connect or disconnect an element without affecting the others. For appliances being plugged into wall outlets, this is a major advantage; for other applications (such as the amplifiers for an undersea telephone cable - which use a series connection) it isn't important.|`|baDOTMGCaa	Question #1<br>  Answer: Disadvantages of series circuit---- The bulbs are dependent on each other. If one bulb fuses the others will not work too. The advantages of the series circuit--- The amount of light given out is brighter. <br>  Disadvantages of a parallel circuit--- The amount of light given out by the bulbs is less bright as compared to the amount of light in the series circuit. Advantages of the parallel circuit--- the bulbs are independent: if one of the bulbs fuses, the others will still work without disruption.<br>  <br>  <br>  Question # 2:<br>  You can go to this website for reference.<br>  <a href="http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/PhysicalScience/electric-charge.html" rel="nofollow">http://facstaff.gpc.edu/~pgore/PhysicalS...</a><br>  <br>  hope this has answered your question. good luck with your studies.

cWuumdy7aa	A Fine Balance is the third book by Rohinton Mistry. Set in Mumbai, India between 1975 and 1977 during the turmoil of The Emergency, a period of expanded government power and crackdowns on civil liberties, this book is about four characters from varied backgrounds—Dina Dalal, Ishvar Darji, his nephew Omprakash and the young lad Maneck—who come together and develop a bond.<br>  <br>  First published by McClelland and Stewart in 1995, it won the Giller Prize. In 2001 it was selected for Oprah's Book Club. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1996. It was one of the selected books in the 2002 edition of Canada Reads, championed by actor Megan Follows.<br>  <br>  An acclaimed stage-adaptation of the novel by the Tamasha Theatre Company was produced at the Hampstead Theatre in 2006 and later revived in 2007.<br>  <br>  The book exposes the changes in Indian society from independence in 1947 to the Emergency called by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mistry is generally critical of Gandhi in the book. Interestingly, however, Gandhi is never referred to by name by any of the characters, and is instead called simply "the prime minister".

There is not too much application (and any application that shows up is very basic and easy). The labs are long but not hard at all. You can also find many of the answers to the lab workbook on the internet. <br>  <br>  AP Chem is a lot of application. You learn the concepts and then apply them to problems. There is a signficant amount of math involved; however, it doesn't get more complex than algebra. The hard part is using what you learned and applying it. There's a lot of "thinking outside the box" involved.<br>  <br>  So obviously, I am biased and would say AP Bio is easier because there is less thinking involved. Also consider the teachers in your school for each subject. All AP Exams have "formulas" that you can follow, and it's what the AP graders look for. The AP graders grade each ENTIRE exam (well, the free response), in like, 10 or 15 minutes. So, they're looking for specific things. Ask around at your school about how people have generally been doing on the exams. My school may not have had all of the best teachers subject-wise, but they knew the AP Exams inside-out. I knew exactly what the AP graders were looking for on the AP Exams, and I got 5's on both Bio and Chem. Am I really good at either of those subjects? Not really...

KTg4Gl1faa	My personal interpretation is that it means one love eclipses another love.  Twilight establishes Bella's love for Edward, New Moon establishes her love for Jacob.  Eclipse is where Bella conflicts over this and then finally chooses one love over another (Edward and his proposal over Jacob).  Her love of Jacob is overshadowed by her love of Edward.  <br>  <br>  Bella and Jacob have a conversation near the end of Eclipse where it is determined that in a normal world Jacob would have been her true love/soul mate.  But that in a world of supernatural (vampires, werewolves) that her love for Edward (a supernatural creature) creates a love that even eclipses a true love/soul mate.<br>  <br>  This is sort of mirrored by Jacob, he knows Bella is his true love/soul mate yet his supernatural self won't imprint on her.  Meaning that his love for her is also eclipsed by a love far greater.|`|aby4FWgwaa	There's a quote in there.<br>  <br>  From Jake, it's basically says that the clouds he can fight, but he can't beat an eclipse.<br>  Edward is Bella's eclipse.<br>  Jacob and Edward are both battling for Bella's heart, but nothing can get in the way of Edward and Bella. Not even Bella's love for Jacob. Edward overshadows all of Bella's other needs and desires.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, that helped you some.

ALL THE BEST|`|TOPJybbsaa	Schools grant the MBA degree, not MBA in retail, or MBA in finance, or MBA in marketing. The MBA is a general broad degree that prepares students for high level management positions. MBA students study accounting, finance, marketing, statistics, management, economics, strategy, policy, leadership, and similar courses. The MBA is not like an MS that concentrates in one field and prepares students for staff positions. MBA programs offer concentrations in various fields, but this amounts only to 2-3 elective courses in the second year. Students develop an interest in some subjects more than others, so they tend to select a concentration in the subject of their interest. This happens in the second year of the program, so you have plenty of time to decide. Also the school can advise you whether recruiters in your area are looking for certain concentrations or want broadly educated candidates.<br>  <br>  Before you consider which MBA program is for you, consult the Official MBA Guide, a comprehensive free public service with more than 2,000 MBA programs listed worldwide. It allows you to search for programs by location (US, Europe, Far East, etc.), by concentration (finance, marketing, aviation management, health management, accounting, etc.), by type of program (full-time, distance learning, part-time, etc), and by listing your own criteria and preferences to get a list of universities that satisfy your needs. You can use the Guide to contact schools of your choice, examine their data, visit their web site, and send them pre applications. You can see lists of top 40 schools ranked by starting salaries of graduates, GMAT scores, and other criteria.

Make your questions broad!!!! lol<br>  <br>  If you are familiar with your "general questions" that you sent each advisor, you will be fine.<br>  <br>  The primary purpose of each question is testing your problem solving and analyitical skills.  <br>  <br>  General is a broad term, and you may not now everything about the topic (in your case BUS AD), they are grading you on how you approach the problem, what data you can use, what resources you can use, and how to interpret the results.<br>  <br>  Hopefully this help|`|Dh0JX2Onaa	The type of test and sometimes even the format varies by school and sometimes even by committee.

It's better to get help than to live being bullied. If you show that you are strong, the bullies are less likely to pick on people who are strong, so even though their comments may be hurtful, remember that deep down, the bully isn't happy as well. They pick on people because they want attention, and don't take their comments personally. Think about all the special things about you, and feel good about yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't ever give into the bully. It's awful to be bullied, but don't let yourself be used.

dxMQAdndaa	I think that it really depends on the degree that he knows you. Most colleges are looking for commentary about your academic work, which is usually best provided by your teacher or counselor. However, if he knows a lot about you and how you have succeeded academically, it would work.<br>  <br>  If you decide you want him to write you a letter, tell him exactly what to address. Including your interest in becoming a doctor would be good as well. If you do get the letter from him and it is not what you are looking for, you can always ask someone else and just not tell him you didn't use his letter. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your application!

ORonhAuvaa	I think it depends on the severity of the disability. Kids with severe disabilities need specialized instruction to help them prepare for an independent life. However, I am not opposed to them going to specials or exploratories. This allows them to benefit from lessons they will not have in their classes. It also allows contact between regular ed and special ed kids and is enlightening to both.<br>  <br>  Kids with mild disabilities can be in the regular classroom with  support. Unfortunately, they do not usually get the support they need because principals feel that inclusion means they can hire less teachers, when in fact it takes more due to scheduling issues. Also, just because you have resource teacher going in or pulling out, does not mean that that teacher knows how to deal with the child.<br>  <br>  For instance I am working with a 6 year old mildly Au student in a regular ed class. His behavior is becoming out of control and the resource teacher does not have the foggiest notion as to how to deal with him. He is disrupting the class on a daily basis. Is that fair to anyone?<br>  <br>  If enough resource teachers were available, who knew what they were doing, then inclusion would be a good idea. Unfortunately, in my experience, this has not been the case.|`|pDvlQQkcaa	I was in the 'regular' classroom for most of when I was in public school and obtaining special education services, and I did not have a problem. It helped other students see that I was no different from them and I was just as capable of successfully completing my assingments.  <br>  <br>  Where I experienced a problem was a period where I was pulled out to go to the 'special education room' for math instruction when my family moved to another state. <br>  <br>  By the time I returned to my regular classroom for instruction in other subjects where I did not need special education services, my classmates were on another subject, in an area where I would not need remedial help, but I still had to play catch up with them. Having a helping teacher come into the room for the 30 minutes which we spent on math daily would have been less time-consuming and more productive for me. I would not have had to play catch up. <br>  <br>  And this 'rich' school/school district reserved it's run-down worn out textbooks for the special ed students. We were using textbooks in that room, during the 1980's which had 60's copyright dates. They were standard math textbooks, just a worn out version which the 'regular' classes did not use any more. <br>  <br>  So, I think inclusion has many more benefits for everybody.<br>  <br>  But at the same time, I understand that some special ed services (PT/OT, speech therapy, diagnostician evaluations/reviews) cannot reasonably be provided inside a 'regular' classroom due to space/privacy issues. You have to pull the student out for those services because there is no other way to effectively deliver them alongside other students.|`|dBpmyIduaa	This is something as the mother of a child with Asperger's and a teacher that I feel very strongly about.  The law states that a special education students should be taught in the least restrictive environment (LRE).  The problem is that most people assume that is only the regular education classroom, when its not.  The LRE is where the child is able to function and learn at his best.  It may be in a regular classroom, regular classroom with pull-out services, a resource room, special school, or hospital.  Each child should be seen as an individual with their own needs which should help the educators to find the LRE for that student, wherever it is.  I worked for over a year to get my child out of the regular school that he was in because it was not the LRE for him.  He needed an environment with fewer people and more one-on-one attention.  There are Asperger students who do not have the same issues as my son and are able to attend regular classes.  Each child has their own strengths and weaknesses.  Every child is unique and they deserve to be taught in the best environment for them.|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Miss Beha- That is really interesting to know. I'm mildly dyslexic.

He is academically bright but socially delayed.  Since 1st grade he's been in a self contained classroom and doesn't get a chance to practice and improve his social skills.

And the regular ed peers would also benefit as well by being exposed to children with differences and develop empathy.  <br>  <br>  By law our kids are supposed to be educated in the least restrictive environment, but lack of funding forces most schools to go with the least expensive.  My son would need his aide to go with him to the regular ed classes- that is really the problem.  His aid is instead used as a classroom aid and taking him into the regular ed class would leave the self contained classroom short one aid.  Inclusion has been shown to work when combined with properly trained staff, preparation of the regular ed teacher and strategies to give the student an opportunity to experience success with his peers.  <br>  <br>  The best life skill that my son's district could give him would be learning how to get along with his peers.|`|z0s8Xc18aa	I am in favor of having a different class for special needs children. It is not that I look down on them or something, but they do need special attention or teaching method to cope up. Regular students might give them unwanted attention or actions resulting from too much liberty given to them in a regular classroom setting.|`|k1QK36eGaa	i go to a regular school and there are some kids in my class with problems and i believe they are taken care of well. they get extra attention and stuff like that and they cope just fine.|`|F08HDRvraa	I have mixed feelings on this issue.  On one hand I feel like there are enough disruptions in the class room (my grandson, 2nd grade) and many children with special needs cause even more disruption.  On the other hand being exposed to these special needs children helps the other children develop empathy for people and not view people that are different as odd.  My grandson was raised around a great uncle who had a stroke and was in a wheel chair.  In kindergarten there was a child in class in a wheelchair and the teacher commented on how helpful my grandson was with this boy.|`|294db1e52bf0162d7d7ff79b4102975faa	I think that it is something that has to be done on an individual basis. My son is autistic and has been in regular ed from the beginning. There are some students that can do well in a reg class with minimal support, some will need an aide  and then there are others that just will not do well in a reg. ed class.

You could say that the pen is mightier than the sword if you stand behind the moral principle of pacifism. The problem with this is that when in a conflict if the "pen" or diplomacy fails, then you leave yourself weak, vulnerable, and unprepared for the conflict<br>  <br>  2. The "sword" or engaging the enemy could be stronger as a means to prevent a conflict and neutralize a threat. Take the events after 9/11 for example. The U.S. engaged in a preemptive strike against Iraq to prevent another terrorist attack. In cases like these direct conflict can be much more efficient thank diplomacy.<br>  <br>  I personally don't agree with preemptive strikes but I'm just giving you some ideas here.|`|MMI8S60Vaa	1. The sword is mightier than the pen 'cuz its made of metal. <br>   2.

7113d2ecd54bd8e6d4704f58cb73decbaa	Dear friend,<br>  the best thing that I would suggest for you - is to go for MBA after a year.<br>  <br>  first complete all your arrears this year then go for MBA - Full time only. If you score 70% and above in MBA then you are sure to get a  good job in market. I am talking about market reality.<br>  <br>  If you go for a Job now you will get only a low paying ... not so established company (because of global slowdown and your marks) ... do you accept that? <br>  <br>  What will happen after 3 yrs?<br>  <br>  You cannot move to a good position ... higher position ... MBA corres/distance/part time are of NO use. Yes, NO use. I can prove that. It is only suitable for people working in Govt  / IT companies / Pvt sector who are already in a good position . and if they want to improve their managerial skills they go for non-full time MBA's. Other than that anybody else (like you me and thousand others) who are looking for a good job .. must only go for Full time MBA's.<br>  <br>  If you do Full time MBA now these are the benefits:<br>  <br>  a) Your score in 10'th, 12'th, UG becomes less important provided you score good marks in MBA<br>  <br>  b) You will have good job growth after 2 yrs (2011 afterward) ... you can also apply for Public sectors like Banks (SBI, Indian Bank etc;) other Telecom like BSNL, MTNL etc; and many more Public sector undertakings ... only if you are a FULL TIME MBA.<br>  <br>  c) Try to participate in more discussions, seminars etc in your MBA.<br>  <br>  These are some of the benefits. So friend think wisely and act!|`|GQJbOblQaa	I suggest that you must look for a job and gain some practical experience besides money, to foot your study expenses.  <br>  <br>  Firstly, clear the back papers and complete BBM.  Look for jobs that interest you and in the line you want to make your future career.  I hope you have some basic computer usage knowledge, besides good communication skills in English.  <br>  <br>  Jobs in marketing are easily available but unless you want to make this as a career, don't opt.  If you can brief me more on your background, suitable suggestions can be given.<br>  <br>  Anyway, look for a job imediately.

I went to enland, ireland, scotland and wales last summer. it didnt help too much academically, but it sure did mentally! it makes you sooo much more independent and a lot more confident (ex. when making new friends)<br>  <br>  Yes, its expensive. Are your AP classes during the time of your travel? If so, i would suggest taking those clases through another program to get dates that can revolve around your travels. <br>  <br>  P2P is a great thing for unniversities to see - most (if not 100%) of admissions offices know about the program. It also raised my GPA last year because the credit that we recieved was considered an A+. Colleges like to see that you are independent,  have good morals and able to present yourself well. <br>  <br>  hope this helped :]|`|Mmu84v4xaa	the people to people program can help you as you will experience many things others don't get to. if money isn't a problem, by all means do it. if money is an issue, consider doing other things. the people to people program may look good on a transcript and be very fun.

AXiKJDV9aa	Higher education is not like that.  It does not guarantee anything.  You will have better odds than if you had no qualification, but beyond that no one can say anything.  At the moment due to the dire economic circumstances the world is in it is doubtful you will get a job with any degree - especially in tourism - it is expected to be hit really hard.  Most people are now using the time to upgrade their qualifications so they can get a job once the economy picks up.

AA10758468	Go for a walk. Works wonders.|`|xqtKODvbaa	unfortunately life is really tough for many people, just remember that you're not the only one who experiences so many problems in life.<br>  <br>  I suggest you stay away from those things that make you feel depressed, mad, and/or sad.<br>  <br>  Get a part time job, go take long walks and/or jog, exercise! get a healthy hobby. As long as you keep your mind busy on something else, something that's healthy for you, it will help you forget about your problems and create a healthier, happier you. <br>  <br>  I can't tell you to change your family because you already know all to well that you just can't change other people. Forget about your friends because if they're not there for you to make you happy, then they're not really your friends. Besides in a few years you'll be out of high school and all that drama will be in the past.<br>  <br>  One of my friends was going through so many troubles about 2 months ago, I gave her the same advice and she volunteered at a local animal shelter where they're always in dire need of volunteers to help walk the dogs, feed them, clean the animals, etc, etc. And animals help soothe our minds anyways. Now she's one of the most happy people I know, and she keeps her mind, body, and soul busy on more important things than those that were causing her problems. Life is too short for that anyways. You may want to try that.<br>  <br>  Just keep your head up honey, and think positive. You'll be fine in the long run. Take care!

72632faa069071cb8e91662911c402faaa	As previously suggested you should review the past tense first.  The past perfect is effectively non-existent without (even an implication) of the past simple tense.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could ask them 2 things they did yesterday (or have them write it down)  Then ask them to put the two sentences in chronological order.  Then ask them to combine the two sentences in a way (using the formula 'had + past participle) The answers should start to surface, and light bulbs will be appearing above their heads.<br>  <br>  Once this is understood, you can move onto explaining how past perfect is different from the past simple, present perfect, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|450d99bbe319077869f2df5d225bac8faa	If there is an ESL student in the class, depending on its level will understand the lesson. You can teach past perfect tense by first teaching past tense first to ESL students individually or go slower to the ESL students.

Many people don't even apply.  The money is there for the taking, just show these organazations that your the best (or at least close!).  Also, as my proffesor says, "published is always a good idea".  So if you want to, or do write, poems, short stories, ect.  GET THEM PUBLISHED!

He has one brother, Seth, because he can't be his own brother.<br>  <br>  Susie only has ONE sister, Sally, because she is the other girl in the family and she isn't her own sister.  She has two brothers, Sam and Seth.<br>  <br>  So, Susie has twice as many brothers as Sam (she has two, he has one) and Sam has twice as many sisters as Susie (he has two, she has one).<br>  Make sense now?<br>  <br>  *edit<br>  OOOOOOOOOOHHH!!!! I see now.  I didn't catch that :D  And here I am thinking I've got it all figured out! :D<br>  <br>  I think Allen was right... I think where it says "Susie has twice as many brothers and sisters" it should probably say "Susie has twice as many brothers AS sisters"....|`|oZPmBHqNaa	Read the problem again. I don't think you copied it right|`|woRykYYVaa	If they are siblings, how can one have MORE brothers and sisters than the other?<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  So then Susie has 3 brothers and 2 sisters according to that. But she is supposed to have TWICE as many brothers and sisters as Sam.. But, Sam only has 2 brothers and 2 sisters. 2 brothers times 2 is 4. So there would have to be 4 boys.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  I know.. my point was that Susie is supposed to have twice as many brothers AND sisters, like the original question states. Therefore, she cannot have only 1 sister, she has to have TWICE the amount of sisters AND brothers that Sam has and that's why the question and your logic don't make sense (no offense).

Collegeboard.com is a good site to find them easy also. The colleges really want you to contact them so its easy to find a majority of things. Also when in doubt you can call the college you love and ask for them to send you a lot of information on there school. Also this will help you to see how the admission staff is at that school. If they are nice and willing then its a good school.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)

2LZbzvY3aa	You can't go directly into pharmacy school.  You need to complete a bachelors degree or at least the majority of it.  The college will give a list of prerequisites you need to have completely usually something like this:<br>  <br>  Math<br>  (through Calc I or Calc II)<br>  <br>  BIOLOGY<br>  microbiology<br>  anatomy<br>  physiology<br>  at least 2 upper division (3000 level or above) bio courses such as genetics, cell biology, virology, something along those lines<br>  <br>  CHEMISTRY<br>  general chem I & II<br>  Organic I & II<br>  <br>  Some schools make you take Biochemistry as well<br>  <br>  <br>  English<br>  2 semesters of college level english (probably a freshman comp I and II course)<br>  <br>  and general freshman courses such as history, government etc.<br>  <br>  After you have taken those courses you need to take whats called the PCAT it is a pharmacy entrance exam.  Not all pharmacy schools require them but its a plus.  Usually you need to make a minimum of a 50 on it.<br>  <br>  They usually want you to have SOME experience in a pharmacy setting, even if its just interviewing a pharmacist<br>  <br>  Pharmacy schools are not only difficult but very competitive!  They want to select people into the programs that they know will complete them!!<br>  <br>  There is no bachelors in pharmacy or masters in pharmacy, once you complete a pharmacy school you have a PharmD degree, a doctor of pharmacy.  You CAN get a phD though<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!<br>  <br>  BTW many people just complete 2 years at community college and apply, it saves a lot of time and money but you will really have to buckle down and learn the classes seriously!<br>  <br>  best of luck!<br>  <br>  As for movie out of the country though... American degrees are fairly employable, but every country has its own standards.  Mostly likely you would have to take a licensing exam in the other country even if you had taken one in the US.  But you can always volunteer outside the US which is a wonderful thing to do.<br>  <br>  GPA - aim for a 3.7 or above!|`|97513408e68930abf4e64bf4d8335b1faa	You want to take as many science and math courses as possible in high school--especially advanced chemistry, calculus, biology, and human physiology.<br>  The higher your GPA, the better your chances of getting into a good pharmacy school, but the cutoff is different for each school.<br>  Again, this differs by school, but generally pre-pharmacy majors now spend 2 years taking basic classes, then have to apply to pharmacy school itself, where they spend another 4 years taking just pharmacy stuff.<br>  You graduate from pharmacy school with a Pharm.D... basically the equivalent of a PhD... in pharmacy.<br>  I don't know much about practicing overseas, but you could always join the military as a pharmacist if you want to travel!<br>  In college you have to take intro chem, organic chem, physical chemistry, and the labs that go with all those classes!  You'll probably also be expected to take calculus, statistics, and a basic physics class.

What do you like to do? Being an entrepreneur is VERY creative and sometimes harrowing. You would be better off pursuing what you really like as a business venture than to try going to school for it. Ask people who are already in your field of interest about it. Would they do it again if they were able to? How did they get themselves established?

What you need to do is look into sciences which interest you. Think up some questions and search for the answers to them. Then you may be interested enough to continue asking questions which is what science is: asking questions and searching for answers. Just find a way to tie the topic you are studying to other topics which interest you.

w2v0Cg5Faa	Well, if you are thinking about living in the house you should consider that, while it is really fun to go to frat parties, it can suck when its your house that is getting trashed that you have to clean up the next day. I lived in a really big house that partied all the time, and while it was really fun, it could really suck to go downstairs the next day and have spilled beer on the floor and passed out strangers on the couch. Since I moved out, I still go to the parties, but its nice being able to leave and come back to my clean apartment :)<br>  <br>  But otherwise, you should pick the guys that you feel more comfortable around- your fraternity brothers are likely going to be the people that you hang out the most with in college, and so you should pick the people that you enjoy hanging out with the most, the guys you think you will get along with best. If you still aren't sure which one to pick, a good way to get a better idea about the frat and the people in it is by looking on facebook- see if the members have any albums posted of their frat functions and see what it looks like the members like to do. So for instance, if you are really into going downtown, and one of the groups looks like they go clubbing all the time that might be the group for you, but if you like to be outdoors and one group has albums from camping and fishing trips, they might be a better group to join. Good luck!|`|hEFthejvaa	choosing a fraternity is the same as choosing your friends. make sure they're ones you're comfortable with & are similar to you. don't choose one that will most likely change you to being someone you're not.<br>  <br>  i'm fortunate to join a frat with a bunch of guys who are always loyal & supportive. it's amazing how much advise i get from them academically yet they still treat me like i'm a brother of the same age instead of a younger brother.<br>  <br>  by the way, if you join one that you don't like it's never too late to quit. don't be shy i'm sure they'll understand. as far as choosing a frat for most of them you have to do a series of interviews with the guys. you have to go to some hangouts, parties, or events that they host then before you know you'll be pledged.<br>  <br>  thanks to my guys, i'm guaranteed to be getting job offers by the time i'm a junior. hopefully your guys can help you out in the same way. best of luck!|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Academic achievement and alumni

gChuGwuvaa	It's so frustrating but it happens alot. It does not make much sense when teachers expect such detail-orientated work but then leave out the minor detail of where to find the rules. They should make that clearer and you shouldn't have to pay for the manual.  As a minimum they should upload a guide on the school web site or buy manuals for the library. Because just leaving students to Google search guides at other sites is confusing and they could be incorrect or in conflict with the teacher's requirements. To be honest I think some teachers are scared of the time it takes to help students properly when they themselves have perhaps not looked at the manuals for a longggg time.

GywOmWfIaa	The Second Trip:<br>  On a second, larger expedition (Sept. 25, 1493-June 11, 1496), sailed with 17 ships and 1,200 to 1,500 men to find gold and capture Indians as slaves in the Indies. Columbus established a base in Hispaniola and sailed around Hispaniola and along the length of southern Cuba. He spotted and named the island of Dominica on November 3, 1493. <br>  <br>  The Third Trip:<br>  On a third expedition (May 30, 1498-October 1500), Columbus sailed farther south, to Trinidad and Venezuela (including the mouth of the Orinoco River). Columbus was the first European since the Viking Leif Ericsson to set foot on the mainland of America. <br>  <br>  The Fourth Trip:<br>  On his fourth and last expedition (May 9, 1502-Nov. 7, 1504), Columbus sailed to Mexico, Honduras and Panama (in Central America) and Santiago (Jamaica). Columbus is buried in eastern Hispaniola (now called the Dominican Republic).<br>  <br>  Perseverance is one way of diplomatically saying that Columbus didn't know when to quit.

I don't think you'd need any variables.  Maybe if you put in the 408 miles apart after 2 hours, and asked how fast the pigeon was flying.
r2bbLMUZaa	It's ok, but way too little description.<br>  <br>  Here's an example I thought up in 1 minute based on yours:<br>  <br>  My name is madeline kallie guiterez and last night I was abducted by aliens.<br>  I awoke to the sound of, something. It was a peculiar sound, one that defied description in my foggy state and I was too disoriented to raise my eyelids and view this new torment in it's entirety.<br>  My eyes slowly unglued, and I received quite a shock to find myself floating in mid air, suspended above a large viewing screen. <br>  What I saw there numbed my mind into disbelief. Earth.<br>  Not the Earth you're used to seeing, the Earth depicted in CGI, infra-red satellite photos and weather forecasts, but Earth, in all it's entirety, spiraling out before me as an immense wall, it's mass so great that it took me a minute to realize it wasn't flat.<br>  I attempted to move, and was surprised to feel the weightlessness disappear, to be replaced with... I don't know. I still don't know. It was a spongy feeling, warm and soft yet at the same time not uncomfortable to stand on, and quite sturdy.<br>  Mild interest quickly gave way to confusion, and then unnerving fear, as I realized I wasn't dreaming. Dreams feel real, but never THIS real.<br>  The sound of footsteps... I believe footsteps... wafted in from a hall to the right. Fear gave way to outright terror and I scrambled to the left, my feet finding swift purchase in the alien flooring. <br>  Turning a corner, I collided with some sort of container and crashed to the ground, my thunderous fall creating little noise as the floor molded itself to me, slowing my descent.<br>  <br>  <br>  You really need something this descriptive.|`|nayy4x3Xaa	lol, chills|`|cjaphGaoaa	yes.<br>  <br>  very suspenseful.|`|GzBSBxqXaa	Indeed it does you wizard of dreamweavers|`|3rUf9JT2aa	yeah...really neat!|`|QM7cAE4vaa	caught my attention!|`|Cb1TD1SVaa	totally|`|ilnmUnhOaa	ooh i really like that!

Our rent was becoming way to high for this tiny apartment that is falling apart day by day. She hated it. I hated to be leaving.

n560blqraa	John Adams was very conflicted regarding his love of the arts, but felt it was his duty to only study the science of government, politics and war, above and beyond any painting, poetry, music, architecture.<br>  <br>  He believed that by only studying the politics of government, it would enable his children and the children of the future to be able to enjoy the arts, and have time for them.<br>  .<br>  Another conflict was during John Adams Presidency with Thomas Jefferson as Vice President, it was the very first time in history that two men, with two totally different political philosophies had to run the country together, side by side. However, during this time our Navy was quite victorious over French vessels, and together they exposed scandalous acts that were occurring in France. Although having political victory, it brought instability to his family life.<br>  <br>  Lastly, John Adams was extremely conflicted between his duties to our country, and his duties as a husband and father.<br>  <br>  I guess one could say, it's ironic that one of the founding "fathers" of our country, did not know how to be father to his own children.

KWvGUoW6aa	I think that dual degrees are a waste of time. In the work force, employers are looking for specialists. They want people who specialize in a particular area. My advice: choose between Accounting and Finance, and get a job in that field. <br>  <br>  Both majors are related; you must take a couple finance courses to get an accounting degree and you also have to take some accounting courses to get a finance degree. You can probably still get a CPA in either case, and you won't have any problem getting a job no matter which one you choose.|`|LFRHO6XWaa	College is as hard as you make it.

MINy26pjaa	It depends on whether or not you can hear the tones of the music and match them when you sing.  This is singing on key.  This is something you are just born with.  Some people can, and some can't. If you can, and your voice doesn't have an unpleasant buzz or something like that, then you can at least be trained, and with practice, could be good.  Some people are just naturals, and don't need training.  <br>  <br>  You need to find someone completely impartial to evaluate your voice.  Friends and family won't always tell you the truth, even if you ask them to, because they don't want to hurt your feelings.  Many voice coaches won't tell you the truth because they want you to give them your money to train you, even if they know you can't sing.  If you've ever seen any of the tryouts for American Idol on TV, then you can see how many people have been lied to by people who probably meant well.<br>  <br>  If your school has a choral program, and you tell the instructor you genuinely want to know if your voice has promise or not, you will probably get an honest answer.|`|VDUDKkRuaa	I believe God granted some singers with talent without a doubt, BUT you can become a great singer if you practice a lot and have a good vocal instructor.

The way I see it is that all neurological conditions should be under one big autism umbrella, and I think every child should have an overall assessment for neurological differences and as has been said up to 40% of all children have to some degree, and then work with there strengths and weaknesses. <br>  <br>  The current system with some asd children, its like throwing the injured to the wolf pack at times, why it continues in this day and age amazes me. It is about time everyone got behind the next generation of children, communities as every child has a right to an education, does not happen and some barely survive school.<br>  <br>   It amazes me that many of the so called do good groups often only support "nice families" too many rules, and those in real need so often no one seems to have the time of day for. Of course there are some great programs and inspirational people who really do help, but not enough. Still I guess the existing school system does not suit many children and for real change the whole system needs to be looked at if you ask me!<br>  <br>  But without the government backing / funding this will never happen and still real awareness needed for all in regards to asd children...

lxRJ2Mlgaa	Be specific.lol. It would be wise to take what you can get.  The World Trading Organization is generally bad for developing countries because it uses a method to control that inherently undermines developing countries (yu have to figure out 4 urself wht tht mthd is).  It is based on a system that gives serious preference to developed and powerful nations--the organization is funded by developed nations which seriously effects the organization and motives of the organizations policies.  Developed countries, then, mantain economic domination by creating contracts(essentially) with developing countries that cannot meet the stringent requirements set forth.  These contracts are legitimized through the WTO.   As a result, a number of countries remain in debt and are unable to compete. It undermines the value of what developing countries are able to provide (agricultural goods) and increases the value of what developed countries produce such as intellectual property rights and technological goods/acheivements.  Developing countries are defeated before they can even win.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	Read about it and make your own decisions about it:<br>  <a href="http://www.wto.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wto.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/wto/" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalexchange.org/campaigns/...</a>

That means that (2a + 4b) becomes -2a + -4b. After doing that, the whole problem would be 5a + 9b + -2a + -4b. Combine like terms :) (If you don't know how to do that, you add the numbers that have the same variables. For your problem you would add 5a and -2a and 9b and -4b. The final answer would be 3a + 5b.<br>  <br>  For the second, there is no negative signs so all you need to do is find like terms. For these, the exponent must also be the same to combine. For example, 2x* and 4x can't combine. Even though the variable is the same, the exponent is not.

If you can manage to get free time (during school, of course), which you probably will if you pay attention to what you do in class, you can sneak in some study time. You shouldn't have much else to do during school hours, so you'll have no choice but to study. Also, if you don't understand classwork, get near someone who is doing great. Ask them questions whenever you need to. People in my classes aren't afraid to stand up and walk across the room to get help.<br>  <br>  P.S. Don't do that last part. Just ask the teacher if you can move.
XcZEl4O0aa	Thomas Jefferson was the guy who made the decision to buy the Louisiana territory.<br>  <br>  As you probably know, Thomas Jefferson was the first Republican, as he essentially founded the party. The basic view of the republican's was that the individual state's should govern themselves, and anything controlled by the national government should have limited power. Also, they believed in equality for everyman. (From a current day view, this is ironic because Socialism is what the early 19th century president was aiming for, which is a controlled, and equal world, but leans way more towards  a heavy national government)<br>  <br>  His main "opponent" was Alexander Hamilton, who founded the Federalist party. Since the U.S. was in a huge debt after our revolution, Hamilton (as our secretary of the treasury) devised a system to pull us out of it. This included having the national government assume all the individual state's debts, as well as the creation of a national Bank of the United States.<br>  <br>  As you can imagine, Jefferson was infuriated of this massive growth in national government, so he vowed to become the president to lower our federal involvement. But as most Human beings, Jefferson let the power get to his head, and ended doing little in the way of lowering the national power.<br>  <br>  Over in Europe, Napoleon Bonaparte was in the middle of leading France's revolution, and was in dire need of cash. He offered the U.S, a bargain for the Louisiana area of about 15 million dollars. Jefferson put aside his Republican views for the outrageously cheap deal, and quickly accepted. Ironically, he used Hamilton's Bank of the U.S. to buy it.<br>  <br>  The entire ordeal basically defined Jefferson's presidency, or was at least a major highlight. It showed that he would indeed jump on a deal, regardless of constitutionality or personal ethics.<br>  <br>  Anyways, there's a brief history behind the purchase, hope this helps =)|`|8RnZb69zaa	jefferson was president and made the decision to purchase the louisiana territory.
0fd322f7e3846eddeeb82c635c2ce31baa	The four great revolutions in thought and religion included the philosophy of China, religion in India, religion of the Jews, and Greek Philosophy. They all have many things in common, but each are unique as well.<br>  <br>  They were important because they developed in the four most advanced cultures of the ancient world. Each movement rose from a crisis or major change, such as the appearance of iron or the outside influence of invading forces. After 300 B.C., there was seldom any new introduction of religious or philosophical thought; alterations to the existing systems were made through a process of evolution and diffusion of central concepts and ideas. Perhaps one reason for the endurance of the major cultures was the formulation of universal questions regarding the human condition.

5gH9bobxaa	Definitely a decent score!<br>  <br>  If you want to improve your math ability, I'd recommend getting the McGraw Hill SAT book.  (Don't get the one that's just math - it's not written by the same author and it's not as good.)<br>  <br>  The reason that I like this book a lot is that it emphasizes the reasoning skills you need to do well on the math section, not just the concepts.  Unfortunately, math classes in school tend to emphasize doing the problem the "right way" rather than thinking about the most efficient way to get to the answer.  The SAT is designed to test your reasoning skills, so the test makers deliberately write questions that test familiar concepts in unfamiliar ways.  With practice, though, the questions will start to look more and more familiar as you get used to the way the SAT requires you to think about math.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aPCO8ygWaa	Your scores are up there, and as you mentioned you do need to improve you math score, but its not really bad. <br>  All I can say is for math during the tests, is relax, slow down, check your work, don't stress. <br>  AND MOST IMPORTANTLY DON'T FORGET THE CALCULATOR!!!! <br>  I did that my Sophomore year and I didn't do too hot on the math section of the SAT.

AA11651908	It's not always the length of your study sessions which is important but the quality.  Good quality, high productivity short sessions could be better and more beneficial for you than longer sessions.  <br>  <br>  If you are still wanting to study for longer try to change the way you study as to make each session different to the last and try to study away from distractions such as ipods, internet, tv etc.<br>  <br>  it is also easier to concentrate if the room you are studying in is cool and bright (natural light is better than electric lighting).  Studying in a library is also gd as ther is almost no distractions and is guarenteed to be quiet. <br>  <br>  you also need a goal to study towards.  It's OK saying I want to study to pass this test but is better to say OK if I study hard and get over 75% I will....( and reward yourself with something you love to do or buy yourself something you want) but stick to the goal and you will get there especially if you are stubborn and know what you want.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!  :)|`|1tISv21saa	Lock yourself in a room with nothing but your books/study material.

ivsKcwwvaa	55. OK. First, especially back then, newly invented technology often took 10-15, sometimes 20 years, before the average person could get, or afford it. <br>  <br>   But some of things that were just coming into use in the 60's. Color TV was huge. If you were the first family on the block to have a color TV, you were the most popular kid. Even though only a hand few of shows were broadcast in color.<br>  <br>   Eight track tapes were new. But only because you could play them in the car. Otherwise, the old vinyl records were still the norm. <br>  <br>   Few people had home air conditioners (window). They were just starting to become available. No schools had them. <br>  <br>   Gas-motor powered lawn mowers were just coming out. Most people had the old manual, non motorized push mowers<br>  <br>  Jet aircraft was new. The military had just achieved Mach 1 speed, breaking the sound barrier. As kids were got all excited when we heard the sonic booms. A big event.<br>  <br>   We all had rotary phones. Push buttons had been invented, but were not generally offered or available until the 70's<br>  <br>   Electric guitars came out in the 60's. The first time you saw Jimi Hendrix or Eric Clapton use one, and make it talk, it freaked you out. <br>  <br>   Every kid had a transistor radio. Most were AM only, but some AM-FM. They were the Walkman or I-Pod of our time. Nobody listened to FM. Cars had only AM radios<br>  <br>   Some people, but most schools had projectors, reel to reel tape. If you were lucky enough to see a computer, it was probably in a government building, and was the size of your kitchen refrigerator. <br>  <br>   And if you went to a really large city, you could ride the escalator, and walk through an automatic door that opened for you. <br>  <br>   There was probably more advanced technologies at the time. But only the very rich could afford them, and we never even saw them|`|xfqHi1tRaa	what happened to people between 40-49?

This will let us solve for 'b' and 't'.<br>  <br>  Multiply both sides of the 't' equation to clear the fraction:<br>  <br>  2t = 20 + b<br>  <br>  Rewrite the 'b' equation to express 't' in terms of 'b':<br>  <br>  b = 10 + t<br>  <br>  becomes:<br>  <br>  -t = 10 - b<br>  <br>  Write the two equations down and add them:<br>  <br>  2t = 20 + b<br>  -t = 10 - b<br>  --------------<br>  t = 30  (the tail is 30 inches long)<br>  <br>  Since b = 10 + t, the body is 40 inches long.<br>  <br>  L = h + b + t<br>  <br>  becomes:<br>  <br>  L = 10 + 40 + 30 or 80 inches in total length.

The next step would be to wait until you find out which university you will be going to (if you're not already in college) and change it to one university on the FAFSA correction 2009-2010. If you're already in college, that's it! Just wait for the financial aid package info during the beginning of next semester/quarter.

i5tOQGgFaa	Head Start Daycare?  Early Head Start?  Didn't sound like it...but most Head Starts' are not Day Cares...but I won't go into that as I already did that once today and I'm coming to a conclusion...personal experience with families and through yahooanswers...that some people use the term head start for all preschools and such and do not understand the difference.  Anyway... so if it is an actual Head Start program... let's remember that any program...federally/state funded or not is only as good as it's teacher.  And especially in a federally/state funded program...it's very difficult to get a child disenrolled.<br>  <br>  Now, for what you can do...you must have that meeting...you need to be respectful but firm asking for details on what is taking place and what the teachers are doing to help both your child and the other child.  You need to be firm about an action plan being made for at least your child...but also for the other child as well.  You need to be firm about having a date set on meeting again and reevaluating the situation.  You also need to be sure that the staff is aware that you are going to teach your child to stick up for herself...that doesn't mean pull hair back or punch, etc...what that might look like is, "Stop pulling my hair!", said in a firm voice.  It also may look like her heading directly to the teacher...this is not the case of the "tattletales" and she needs to be told to head toward the teacher when she sees this child coming toward her.   She needs to be given permission to stand up for herself.  Please please please teach her this.  Because you are right..you can't do much about the other child.  <br>  <br>  Just a side note... I know you saw the child...and probably know the child's name and the parents even...but these teachers and directors have to show confidentiality in this area...so they most likely will not be giving you any information regarding that child as an individual...so go in looking for ways to help your child not berating the other child and the family.  Hopefully it all works out for the best.  Bullying is not a pleasant situation for anyone involved (including the teachers).|`|7uqAS3Ozaa	if a talk with the school cant work, then no choice but changing daycare centre. it is for your daughter's sake.|`|DE3McQbMaa	You can always call the police, tell the girl's parents, or maybe send your kid to another school.

It sounds to me as though the teachers are not doing their job if they are not dealing with the situation. As one other person mentioned it is a good thing to have a chat with The Director of the centre and if the situation is still not resolved, I suggest two things.<br>  1) You look at other centres and find out what there polices are on this kind of thing before you enroll her and you also spend time with her before she starts so you can see for yourself how the staff and children interact with each other.<br>  2) Here in Australia we have accderaters who come out and assess schools and if they are not up to standard they have the power to close them down. I suggest you find out if there is something similar in your area and give them a call. If Headstart is a chain there maybe a someone who you can all in there head office.<br>  Good luck with it.

mhFpZT3laa	I would choose Pitt personally. The biggest things to get into medical school, aside from GPA and MCAT scores, are that you have had interesting and meaningful experiences in:<br>  1) Community Service<br>  2) Medically related volunteering/work<br>  3) Research (most important for those wanting to go to a research heavy school)<br>  <br>  Everything else that you do outside of these three areas is what makes you unique, interesting, and can only improve your chances. I personally feel that one of my strongest features when applying was my dancing experiences. These three things, especially 1 and 2, are critical to many schools, because it shows both a tendency towards compassion and charity, as well as provides you with a basis to prove why you want to go to medical school. Because of this, here are my personal recommendations on selecting a school.<br>  <br>  1) Has a research program that is large enough to sustain undergraduate participation.<br>  Look for schools that have undergraduate thesis projects, undergraduate fellowship positions, etc. A school with Research 1 designation is great, because that means there are tons of research projects going on. If you never publish or present a paper, that's fine. However, doing so can be a major boost, especially if you are author or co-author, or even 29th author of a paper that makes it into a major journal like Nature. It does not necessarily have to be medically related research, but I would recommend it if you are contemplating MD/PhD.<br>  <br>  2) A moderately well known school.<br>  I personally would recommend limiting your choices to one of the top 200 or so schools. You want a school that has had a decent number of pre-meds, because this increases the chances of an admissions committee knowing something about the opportunities available at your school. It also increases your chances of getting good advising from a pre-med office. I am a member of the faction that believes that prestige is not a significant factor in the admissions process. Having gone to a public school that isn't even ranked in the Top 100, I have interviewed at a number of the Top 20, 10, and 5 schools. I personally believe that your own merits outweigh the name of your school significantly. This is not to say that I believe a 3.5 is the same as one school than another. Admissions committees often have "experts" on a given school, or look at statistics like the average GPA and MCAT score of pre-meds in past years. Thus, a 3.5 at Princeton might be more impressive than a 3.5 at John Doe public school, simply because the average GPA and MCAT score at Princeton is a 3.5/33, and a 3.5/28 at John Doe. Clearly, it was harder to earn a 3.5 and 33 at Princeton than a 3.5 and 33 at John Doe (though, the equal MCAT scores would somewhat minimize this). Suffice it to say that a 3.5 and 28 at Harvard isn't going to beat out a 3.8 and 31 at John Doe, all other things being equal. This being said, I feel that opportunities at the more prestigious undergrad schools outside of academics are excellent. However, I feel that any big public school like OSU, ASU, etc will have similar opportunities by virtue of their sheer size. Any school that made it in the top 200 should have enough of everything for you to succeed if you are good enough. If you are good enough at one place, you are good enough anywhere, so long as you aren't handicapped.<br>  <br>  3) A School with a medical school or that is near one.<br>  The inside man always has an advantage. If you went to Harvard College, you will have a stronger shot at Harvard Med. This is because you have three years to build relationships with the medical school, do research under doctors affiliated (and thus get letters) with the school, and become an expert on that school. The opportunity to work with doctors at any medical school probably increases your chances everywhere. There is always the chance that they will be recognized, and its a great way to get insight in academic medicine.<br>  <br>  4) Go to a school near a reasonably sized city.<br>  Cities have a lot going for them by virtue of their huge populations. There are all sorts of activities available in research, community service, and just fun things that will make you a more well rounded and interesting person. Being near a city means you will also be near at least a few good hospitals or clinics. This saves you on travel time and ease of access, as it is likely students from your school have already built connections with nearby schools.

His mother explained to him that it was because they now attended segregated schools, but assured him that he was as good as anybody else. <br>  <br>  Through the early and mid 20th century,  segregation was a fact of life.  People were not able to use the same public restrooms, drinking fountains, and businesses because of the amount of melanin in their skin.  Interracial marriage was a criminal offense.

AA10067221	1.) Cultural Evolution:<br>  Culture, it would seem, is a catalyst, speeding the course of evolution toward an uncertain future.<br>  What’s more, not only does change on Earth continue, it has recently done so more rapidly than a lifeless Nature would have. Humankind itself has now become part of that change—altering it, selecting it, accelerating it. <br>  If any one factor has characterized the evolution of culture, it’s probably an increasing ability to extract energy from Nature—but not merely to capture energy, rather to store it, to transfer it, to use it more efficiently. Over the course of the past 10,000 years, humans have steadily mastered wheels, agriculture, metallurgy, machines, electricity, and nuclear power. Soon, solar power will emerge in its turn. Each of these cultural innovations has channeled greater amounts of energy into society.<br>  The ability to harness energy and thus order our daily lives are defining characteristics of modern society. But energy use is also a source of rising disorder in our surrounding environment—global pollution, waste heat, social tumult, among other societal ills. Ironically, the need for increased energy and natural resources so vital to our technological civilization is also a root cause of many of the sociopolitical problems now facing humankind at the dawn of the new millennium.<br>  <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/co..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tufts.edu/as/wright_center/co...</a><br>  <br>  -Here are some topics that are closely connected to your particular age group or generation:<br>  __1. -Cyber-bullying: (cyberbullying is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices.") Cyber-bullying has grown as a means of threatening, intimidating or harassing others over the past several years. It can take many forms, including posting private or embarrassing photos of someone, developing websites to rate people’s appearance, creating hateful blogs about someone, stealing electronic passwords, or spreading lies. This controversial issue explores the arguments of censorship, the freedom of speech, the definition of 'willful harm/harassment' and about whose responsibility it is, either the parents, teens, internet police, etc., to protect young on-line users from cyberbullying.<br>  <a href="http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberbullying.us/index.php</a><br>  __2. -The Pursuit of Perfection: This controversy is regarding the amount of pressure parents, schools, the media, and peers put on teens to be "perfect," successful, beautiful, etc. In addition to the potential for individual harm, there is an absolutely certain cultural harm related to the mass pursuit and glorification of physical perfection. In her 1992 bestseller, The Beauty Myth, Naomi Wolf describes a $33 billion "thinness industry", a $20 billion "youth industry", and a $300 million "cosmetic surgery industry" and admonishes the commercial forces propelling women towards never ending external improvements. The marketing of plastic surgery to a younger and younger clientele only intensifies a conspiracy that requires women to be evaluated by homogenized perceptions of beauty instead of more integrated and realistic virtues. Why would any of us want to live in a world that requires all of us —from 14-year-olds to 50-year-olds — to have Britney Spears' breasts, Reese Whiterspoon's nose and a 4-year-olds' crease free forehead? All women are the losers in this game and we are already in the fifth inning if 20-somethings are scheduling Botox injections and teens are requesting painful surgical procedures as presents. <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma..." rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishworldreview.com/0205/ma...</a><br>  <br>  -Here are two interesting & new research topics in human psychology/sociology:<br>  1.)---Feeling "left out in the cold," literally---<br>  A new study indicates that social isolation makes individuals feel physically cold and in need of hot foods and drinks. <br>  According to a study published in Psychological Science, getting the cold shoulder is more than just a metaphor. Feeling cold is part of the social rejection experience. <br>  The study found that individuals feel a considerable drop in room temperature when socially excluded; they literally experience being left out in the cold. Findings show that the choice of hot soup and coffee over warm or room-temperature foods and beverages in such conditions may be a coping mechanism for loneliness and social isolation. <br>  Loneliness not only induces anxiety and depression but also activates brain areas linked to the experience of physical pain. Psychologists concluded that the psychological world can bias an individual's sensation of the physical world, suggesting that emotional feelings are tied to physical sensations. <a href="http://current.com/items/89312310_feelin..." rel="nofollow">http://current.com/items/89312310_feelin...</a><br>  2.)---Gossip helps to glue society together' says study---<br>  Lots of gossip is good for society and helps people to trust each other and to be more charitable, according to a study recently published. Research has shown that reputation is the reason that (unlike so many other creatures) humans help strangers and unrelated people. Reputation is important for the evolution of human cooperation, through a process called "indirect reciprocity", summed up by 'I help you and somebody else helps me'. <br>  A team of researchers wanted to find out how much gossip can be relied on as a good guide to reputation and how much it can be abused to destroy a reputation. They found, in experimental games in which students could write comments about other people (a form of gossip) that the ability to tarnish others is diminished, the more gossip there is. Is gossip really good for us in the real world, or does it breed all kinds of problems and worries? Has gossip ever got you into trouble? <a href="http://current.com/items/89157252_gossip..." rel="nofollow">http://current.com/items/89157252_gossip...</a>|`|AEAxZEveaa	write about how Kuru was cured in papua new guinea after they discovered it was caused by cannibalism. <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  the differences in how mental disorders are perceived in different cultures (schizophrenia vs. being posessed)<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  munchausen syndrome or munchausen syndrome by proxy<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  antisocial personality disorder<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  whether "amazon" women (societies of female warriors) existed<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  the use of lobotomy in psychiatric medicine (rosemary kennedy was brain damaged from a lobotomy gone wrong)|`|inCByaonaa	Erm Sociology: The pressure to be thin.

YupMCYHlaa	Actually it did have to do with the French and Indian War.  The Brits called it the Seven Years' War.  It was actually the first 'world war' because it was fought various places in the world where the French and the English were fighting over colonies and territory.<br>  <br>  The English sent a lot of troops here to fight the war.  They won, but it was very expensive for them.  They decided to raise taxes on the American colonies, since they felt they'd fought the war for them, to protect them.  The Stamp Act and later the so-called Intolerable Acts were designed to allow England to recoup some of the cost of the war.  Also they posted a lot of English soldiers here after the war, and that was expensive too, so they thought the colonists should pay for that also.<br>  <br>  In fact, when the American colonists got angry, they didn't want to be independent, they only wanted the rights that all other British subjects had, of representation in Parliament.  It wasn't until fairly late in the process that they decided they really wanted to be independent.  So it wasn't so much the taxes that bothered them, it was not having a say in the taxes.  When the Declaration of Independence was written, the Revolutionary War was already going on!|`|NZyFz90Jaa	It was a sin to go against your king<br>  <br>  Thay had every right to tax us because they are our mother country.<br>  <br>  Um.. thats all i got|`|1zEZbsWJaa	Well i have just done this unit in social studies, The king of Britain at the time had everyone in Britain had to pay taxes BUT they had a representative. he made the colonist pay to help PAY for the soldiers and Yes it does have to do with the French And Indian Wars.

wvFWexsmaa	do you know what sneaky squares is? its probably the simplest way...<br>  <br>  set up a box, and divide it into four equal parts.  in the top left box, write x squared. in the bottom right box, write 15.<br>  now, since you know x squared seperated is just x and x, so imagine it as a grid. since the box you have x squared written in has a spot right to the left of it and to the right of it, write a single 'x' in each of those spots to represent the x's that go into x squared.<br>  <br>  now, think of factors for fifteen. five and three, fifteen and one. which of those will multiply for fifteen, and add up to give you -8? play around with it on your calculator, I believe its -5 and -3.<br>  so, in the bottom left box (which should be empty) write -5 in that spot just to the left of it, below the x that should already be written for the top box. now follow the grid: -5 times the x that it meets with at the top comes to -5x, so write -5x in the actual bottom left box. now for the only empty box left, the top right; do the same, but with -3. write -3 in the space right above the box, and since -3 times the x it meets with is -3x, write -3x in your top right box. basically, you've made your equation.<br>  read the left outside of the box first, it should say x - 5. then read the top, it should say x - 3. that's your equation:<br>  (x-5)(x-3)=0<br>  so solve now, by taking each parenthises set seperately equal to zero.<br>  x-5=0 comes out to x being positive five, and x-3=0 comes out to x being positive three.<br>  so there's two possible answers for this problem: x = 3 or 5<br>  idk if you were actually supposed to solve it out,  or if your teacher just wanted you to get to the (x-5)(x-3) part. but anyway,<br>  <br>  <br>  sorry if that totally confused you or you already knew how to do sneaky squares or had your own method and just found the particular problem tricky. hope I helped though...  : )|`|PtJnPMh7aa	(x-5) (x-3)|`|qRcwellTaa	(x-5)(x-3)

He was rejected twice by the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna (1907–1908), citing "unfitness for painting", and was told his abilities lay instead in the field of architecture.[13] His memoirs reflect a fascination with the subject:<br>  <br>  The purpose of my trip was to study the picture gallery in the Court Museum, but I had eyes for scarcely anything but the Museum itself. From morning until late at night, I ran from one object of interest to another, but it was always the buildings which held my primary interest.[14]<br>  <br>  Following the school rector's recommendation, he too became convinced this was his path to pursue, yet he lacked the proper academic preparation for architecture school:<br>  <br>  In a few days I myself knew that I should some day become an architect. To be sure, it was an incredibly hard road; for the studies I had neglected out of spite at the Realschule were sorely needed. One could not attend the Academy's architectural school without having attended the building school at the Technic, and the latter required a high-school degree. I had none of all this. The fulfillment of my artistic dream seemed physically impossible.[14]<br>  <br>  On 21 December 1907, Hitler's mother died of breast cancer at age 47. Ordered by a court in Linz, Hitler gave his share of the orphans' benefits to his sister Paula. When he was 21, he inherited money from an aunt. He struggled as a painter in Vienna, copying scenes from postcards and selling his paintings to merchants and tourists. After being rejected a second time by the Academy of Arts, Hitler ran out of money. In 1909, he lived in a shelter for the homeless. By 1910, he had settled into a house for poor working men on Meldemannstra?e.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mien kampf or in english my struggle<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf</a>|`|CReJUm4Gaa	2nd grade ? jk i have no idea .. u can go to the library tho and im sure they will have tons of books  and they library ppl can help u find the book he wrote good luck

The intestines were not used to the large amount of food. <br>  You cannot starve a man and then let him eat a banquet.<br>  People who have lost over 40 percent of their body weight, have to be started out on soups. fluids, milk.<br>  Ok: Starvation creates a condition called (Inanition ) In this state the patient should be started on fluids, dextrose, small amounts, The stomach is unable to accept large amounts of food, the organs may rupture, especially the intestines, which become thin when a person is starved. Large amounts of food can cause death. Whole studies have been done on the different treatments of the Concentration Camp Survivors.<br>  When a patient enters a hospital having lost 40 percent of their weight, due to say an efferent loop obstruction, the doctors insert a tiny tube into the heart muscle, this tube is connected to lipids, (fluids which will nourish the body), now the doctors will calculate how many drops per minute, the patient should receive, the interns will ask why not turn the machine up to maximum output, and the Physician will remind them of the Auschwitz, Bergan Belsen studies which concluded that people who have been starved, cannot in all safety be given large amounts of food.

AA11365951	I think AP Government is ABSOLUTELY important when it comes to economics! Look at the current economic crisis and how it has landed on the government's shoulders. The two are interrelated, and definitely worth taking. <br>  <br>  I think any class that provides some fun is worth it, and if Culinary Arts and Tennis will do that for you, then by all means, go for it! <br>  <br>  Statistics looks like fun and it will be extremely helpful! I just hope you're up for the challenge of 4 APs. Please tell me that Macro and Micro economics are 2 one-semester classes! I really wish my school offered them. Banking and Financial systems will be especially relevant right now, and actually sounds like fun, as will Consumer and Family Economics. <br>  <br>  You can take calculus in college, I think. If you went to my school and were planning on taking Statistics, you probably wouldn't be qualified for Precalculus anyway. <br>  <br>  Good luck next year!

8yE2sYGeaa	It is normal. Your thoughts are racing ahead of your ability to say them properly|`|8078b060eeeeedad269ae982e11dfc38aa	Word salads is what it is called.  Normal?   Hmmmmm-  everyone does it occasionally.  If you do it often it might be a problem.  I think as you get older, it happens more often.  By old I mean a senior citizen like me, the older I get the more often I notice myself doing it.
cL0aHkYEaa	Wow!  Good call on your part!  Hate to say it, but your teacher's instructions are very ambiguous!  While her sentence can be taken to mean that you are to write on one thing or the other, I suspect that what your teacher means is that, now that you have been introduced to "A Modest Proposal" AND some satirical songs, that you are to make up your own.  Apparently, both Swift's piece and the songs are similiar in style, so you would write your satire with that in mind.<br>  <br>  Since you are asked to write a satire in the vein of "A Modest Proposal," it might be a good idea to pick something very current, as that was what Swift's piece did.  For example, you could use the home foreclosure crisis as a good current issue to be approached satirically.  Since you are to use his style as a model for your own piece, you will want to begin (for this topic or any other) by painting the dire situation that so many home buyers are in today.  Be descriptive about the tragedy, the effects on the economy, etc.  Then when you begin to discuss possible fixes, you want to be as absurdly unkind as you can--have the government burn the houses down and make laws making it illegal for any homeless people to be loitering in any public area for more than 15 minutes at a time, etc.<br>  <br>  Swift's satire was so effective because he laid out a case that invoked reader empathy and compassion, and then when they least expected it, gave them a ghoulish scenario as a fix.  The goal is to have the audience come to view the author  (you, in this case) as despicable.<br>  <br>  Read Wikipedia's article (following).  There are some excellent pointers there.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Proposal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Modest_Pr...</a>|`|c5781698517cedf4e1984d7e4e42d5bfaa	i just finished reading a modest proposal...well the entire piece is a satire to poke fun at all of the people who see homeless people and do nothing about it.. swift suggests eating the children to get rid of the problem and provide food for others.. what he is really saying is that society has gotten so outrageous that they are just ignoring major problems.. the piece in and of itself is a satire.. you may have to write a satire about the issue just like swift did, or you may have to actually make fun of swifts idea to eat children. im not entierly sure.... hope this helped :D

There is a great deal of study involved and some countries have recognized apprenticeship schemes that encourage employers to engage apprentices.<br>  <br>  Depending on where you live (your country) you may have to spend time at vocational college in tandem with working 'on-the-job.'<br>  <br>  I suggest that you visit a reputable Automotive Dealership and ask to speak with the Service Manager or one of the Mechanics and they should be able to tell you what is involved in commencing your trade journey.<br>  <br>  My advice is to be employed with a reputable dealership - a company who will organize on-going training and who have all the specialist tools and equipment so that you can bring a professional approach to your work from day one.<br>  <br>  Later you might choose to work on Earth-moving, Mining and Marine equipment.<br>  <br>  You need to have good grades in Maths and generally. Pay will depend on the Award Rates in your Country.<br>  <br>  It is a career that you can take with you around the world and could involve travel to Parent Companies for specialist training.

I do believe this statement.<br>  <br>  Usually people (Murderers) are sentenced to the death penalty by laws enacted by individual States or Countries.<br>  <br>  This means that the State or Country commit murder on behalf of its population.<br>  <br>  Not everyone  wants to 'take a life for a life.'<br>  <br>  Whatever the crime, I find it difficult to see how taking another life can be considered justified or payment for a crime.<br>  <br>  Mercy is a high attribute in anyone who chooses to be merciful. Hate and vengefulness is not morally acceptable.<br>  <br>  Question: Ever done something really bad and been forgiven? That is mercy in action.

It might be a requirement of the school dress code and thus be inappropriate.

What would you prefer?|`|1Dshgmywaa	I think there is definitely a nurturing or "motherly" feeling toward students. Personally, I would want my students to cover themselves if they are wearing something inappropriate. Not because of the school dress code, but because I think that they may be perceived in a way they don't want to be (by boys, perhaps) and receive unwanted attention. It's also distracting in class for other students.<br>  <br>  And of COURSE I would ask a student to put on a coat if it's cold! So many students don't even come to school with coats.

So you have to decide if you want the location to be a farm (plowing, planting harvesting) or a ranch raising cattle or horses.  Ranching  implies more wealth than a small rural farm.  Next you need to define  a while back, which I'm assuming will be before 1920s and the Great Depression.  You mention the US Old West which puts your story most likely after our Civil War so that would be 1870s or so.  I'd then go with possibly Nebraska or Missouri.

04hTn3vSaa	Well, as a major of psychology, first, you will need to choose whether you want a BS degree or a BA degree. Some schools only offer one type, and they are essentially the same. The difference between them is that a BS is a Bachelor of the sciences, and you will be required to take more science classes. A BA is a Bachelor of the Arts and you will take more humanity and literature classes.<br>  <br>  When you FIRST start college, you will not take many of your classes for your psychology major. You will be taking "general education" classes. This doesn't mean you CAN'T take psychology classes. However, for the first two years of college, you will generally be taking regular classes, with a psychology type class thrown in.<br>  <br>  The number of courses varies from school to school, so check the website of the school you are interested in.<br>  <br>  However, generally, a psychology major will need to take psychology classes (duh) You will probably need to take courses similar to these:<br>  Introduction to Psychology<br>  Introduction to Psychological Statistics (math-ish class)<br>  Research Methods in Psychology<br>  Introduction to Developmental Psychology<br>  Developmental psychology<br>  Cognitive psychology<br>  Social psychology<br>  Personality psychology<br>  <br>  as well as some other classes you choose as "electives" however, they are not exactly the same type of electives in high school. You need them for your degree, and they will need to be mostly upper-division courses.<br>  <br>  <br>  ..and yes, for most colleges these days, you need to choose a major when applying! It is sometimes harder to get accepted as an undeclared major.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	You do understand that unless you get a doctorate, which will take at least 8 years, that there are no jobs for psych majors?|`|AA11280073	No, you do not need to choose a major now. Some people don't decide on a major until they are juniors in college. You need to decide on a college and send away for their catalogs. After you are accepted, you will find out how many courses you need to take to qualify as a full time freshman. You will probably be taking a liberal arts program and everything will be mapped out for you. You will have a college adviser to help you.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	Well, check these links. You will find all kind of answers to your question on these sites. Moreover, you would also be able to apply for an online degree in psychology.

SIhxrxD3aa	Well, vet schools won't see what you took in high school.  You just need to take the science courses that will help you with the courses you'll have to take in college.  You should take chemistry, biology and physics.  Try to take the most challenging levels that you can.  Also, if your school offers more specific bio courses, then anatomy/physiology and genetics would be a good idea.  <br>  As far as math goes, you don't really need that much.  Some vet schools don't require math as a pre-requisite, while some require calculus and some statistics.  Try to take calculus in high school if you can, but don't worry if you don't get that far because you can always take it in college.  Just take math all 4 years and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  Even more important than the courses you take in high school is start getting veterinary experience now.  It's very difficult to get into vet school and if you have more experience than the average applicant, your chance of getting accepted is greater.|`|MmjGvTSfaa	alot of Biology and Anatomy/Physiology.

Wcjc8Au1aa	The conversion formula works only if you measure the angular velocity in radians.  3540 revolutions = 7080 pi radians.  So the angular velocity in radians per minute is 7080 pi.  The diameter is 1 foot, so the radius is 0.5 feet.  To convert to linear velocity, we multiply angular velocity by the radius, so we get<br>  7080 pi (0.5)<br>  or<br>  3540 pi<br>  But that's in feet per minute.  To get feet per hour, we multiply by 60:<br>  3540 pi (60) = 212,400 pi<br>  To get MILES per hour, we then divide by 5280:<br>  212,400 pi / 5280 = about 126.38<br>  So the linear velocity in miles per hour is about 126.38

Check into the University of Texas at Arlington in their Urban and Regional Studies graduate program, and in two years you can have a Master's Degree in such, and be very employable.  They are very good at getting their students actively involved in governmental projects in the region, and you can easily move up from an already fantastic start.  If you still want to be a lawyer or such, go ahead, but just realize that not only U.T. at Arlington but other universities nationwide have similar programs,  you'll have a much wider venue of careers to look into.

3e35557c1209f00a8aa425bc5e8138b8aa	1) No, you cannot get a CPA license (which is required if you want to do auditing) with an MBA accounting concentration if you don't have an undergraduate accounting degree.  Go to your state's board of accountancy website and look up the specific details required to obtain a CPA (education, experience, and exam requirements).  Usually states require you to have 150 total credits, including 30 accounting credits, in order to get your CPA license.  You would also need to have at least 24 accounting credits before sitting for the CPA exam.  <br>  <br>  2) I will go against the grain here and suggest that an MBA degree is not a good idea at this point.  Most MBAs concentrate in finance and go into investment banking, and as you know, the current financial meltdown is not good news for investment bankers.  Those MBAs who don't go into investment banking typically already have established careers in other fields, such as engineering, and simply want to take on more management responsibilities in their current positions (such as chief engineer).  <br>  <br>  If you are looking to enter the business field for the first time, then I would suggest getting a Master of Accounting degree and CPA license.  Auditors are still in high demand and relatively unaffected by the financial crisis.  An MBA can be too broad, which would make it more difficult to find entry level business jobs that require specific skill sets.|`|ERFB6rKMaa	You can surely work as an accountant with your MBA in accounting.  However, the question should be what exactly you want to do when you graduate, not IF you can work in accounting.  With an MBA, you should be aiming something more than an accountant.  You can start there, but think long-term about progressing into controller, CFO or even CEO.  Also, with your psychology degree, you may try to use both (that and accounting) in something more specific, like CFE (certified fraud examiner), for example, in FBI.|`|Dl6NIYt5aa	Check this link.

There are several accredited online universities that are providing this degree.|`|TOPJybbsaa	An MBA with a concentration in accounting and without an undergraduate degree in accounting would not give you enough background to get the CPA certificate. You may be able to get a job in accounting, but you could not advance far. However, the MBA is a broad degree that opens many doors. A concentration in a good MBA program consists of 2-3 elective courses in a field, and it is not as important as all the other courses you study that prepare you for high level management positions. With your work experience you would be a good candidate for a quality MBA program.<br>  <br>  Consult the Official MBA Guide.

8SmMYdBLaa	They must mean on the "old" SAT. This means that they are looking for a combined score of 1250 on JUST the math and verbal sections (aka not counting the writing section). SAT and ACT scores are easily comparable and someone who got a 28 on the ACT would likely get a 1260/1600 on the SAT (see link for details) so neither score is really easier to get.     As for which actual test is harder, I would say they are about equal. Go for the SAT if you aren't good at science though, because the ACT has a science section and the SAT does not.    Btw, a 28 on the ACT compares to an 1860 on the "new" three section SAT.|`|Jzr8UmFKaa	SAT

yJSPecgoaa	Good for you for doing so well at homeschooling, as well as for evaluating whether or not to continue doing so.  It’s always good to re-evaluate our positions in life.<br>  <br>  I must tell you, though, that if your sole reason for returning to public school is to get experience with “dating,” you might want to rethink things a bit.  Dating at this age will do nothing to help you when you’re older, and it may even hinder you some.  That’s because boys at this age typically are not yet ready for mature relationships with the opposite sex.  They tend to be more interested in getting sexual experience from willing girls (whom they convince they are “dating”), only to summarily dump them and move on to the next girl.  <br>  <br>  I can assure you that in no way are you a “loser” for not dating at this age.  My own teenagers all can attest to that fact.  If anything, girls who begin dating this young too often get socked with a bad reputation that is impossible to ever live down.  The only boys subsequently interested in such girls tend not to be at all serious about them.  You deserve better than that.<br>  <br>  The fact that, despite your being quiet and shy, everyone loves you and wants to be your friend is right where you want things to be.  Don’t risk ruining it all by sullying your reputation by dating guys before they are anywhere near ready to take you seriously, and far too prone to dumping you when they can no longer handle the demands of the dating  relationship.  Guys this age don’t mean to be this way; it’s just that they haven’t yet matured to the level they *will* be at some day, but just not yet.<br>  <br>  I know you are concerned about overcoming your shyness.  Actually, the surest way to further *entrench* your shyness (and perhaps even bring on extreme insecurity on top of it) is to date guys before they are ready to handle you properly.  Being dumped without any warning (or logical reason) is a horrible feeling for any girl who chooses to date this young.<br>  <br>  Continue homeschooling and showing your horses, whom you love with all your heart, and who undoubtedly love you back with all of theirs.  Your best bet for not being a “loser” is to stay right where you are…for now.  Waiting to date guys for when *they* are ready to handle a more mature relationship is the far better course to follow.<br>  <br>  You sound like a very impressive person who deserves the best of everything in all due time.  Sending all good thoughts your way.|`|bghotovYaa	I think you should continue Homeschooling.<br>  I am homeschooled and  in YR 12  right now and it is SSSSOOOO much easier than attending a public school.<br>  Anyway, DO NOT think that you need "dating-experience" when you're a kid!!!<br>  You'll have heaps of time for that in the future.|`|oZ39bLSkaa	The previous poster pretty much hit the nail on the head. Please do not go to high school for the sole reason of dating. Everything she said about dating and boys this age is so true. Much better to develop a friendship than to spend the emotional energy and time on a relationship that is likely to bring more pain, stress and strife into your life.<br>  <br>  Our society puts far too much importance on dating and at a young age. Please do not buy into it. It sounds like you have found your niche with your horses.You have a great thing going! Keep it up and focus your energies on things that have lasting value:true friendship, your family and your education among others.<br>  <br>  All the best.

What is the disadvantages in being hyper active. If there is nothing wrong in hyper active don't try anything different on him. He is just a kid. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you ask me he can be a genius. Do you know one thing it is universal fact that no one person on earth can concentrate on one thing for over 45min. So if you find your son cannot sit over 45 min then you should accept the fact that he is very very normal with brilliant energy and spirit. Don't try to pull his spirits down just observe what he is doing if you let him free. You say that he is good in organising and participating at sports, computer and photography. Do you think he is normal like other Indian students? Definetly not he is brilliant and outstanding. He is surely the least percent of student who could be able to do and have the team spirits and leadership qualities at this age. Don't take him to any psychatrist and spoil his spirits.

7RriQDbkaa	On a test, the only resource that you have is your brain.  On a class assignment, you have other resources (books, articles, internet, etc.) to turn to for support.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	Similarities are: both assess writing skills including organization and conventions, etc.<br>  <br>  Differences are: test essays usually have a time limit, require quick mental processing, require background of information on the topic, few or no source citations, and the teacher would probably be more lenient with spelling, punctuation and other convention errors.<br>  <br>  Assignment essays would be longer since you have unlimited time; they would likely require research, and you would be able to quote passages and cite sources; you should have fewer convention errors.

LwywrSRkaa	Hi there here are some tips for you!<br>  <br>  To start of you can make a revision schedule. Whatever you make don't plan it for a long period of time but perhaps for a week. Some people find it's better to concentrate on one subject and others find it's better to do different ones so they don't get bored. You should do about 10-30 minutes a session (and then change the subject for the next session) and then take a break. You should at least spend 2/3 hours a day. Leave one day to give yourself a rest though.<br>  <br>  Prepare beforehand, make check lists of things you already know and things you don't, or what you need help with and so on.<br>  <br>  Switch of everything that can distract you (like music, the computer etc.). Also find a place that's comfy for you, and not a boring old study room where you can't concentrate! Choose a place where you can work to the best of your ability.<br>  <br>  You can break stuff down into 10, 20 or 30 minutes and swap it between different subjects. If you are somebody who gets distracted easily, strictly do 10 minute sessions!<br>  <br>  When you make a revision timetable don't make it too hard either cos you might not stick to it. Make it nice and simple so you can stick to it. As you feel more comfortable with whatever you planned you can increase the difficulty. And you can also reduce your play time wherever you slot it.<br>  <br>  You will also need to find your own revision methods, I like making notes, doing podcasts, posters, flash cards etc. find out what works best for you. Make it look interesting though; not boring but colourful and attractive so you will be more motivated. Ask friends or family to test you too. I find what works for me, is to get my revision books get to the pages I need to revise take a whole bunch of plain paper. I learn a page then I scribble down everything I remember.<br>  <br>  Also when you go home from school you can note down what you have done and try making useful notes during lesson times. Just pay attention a lot and ask your teachers if you don't understand things.<br>  <br>  To remember things try sticking posters up your wall or places where you go past a lot at home. There is this story technique as well and basically if you for example need to know the reactivity of metals you will have to write them down first and next to it write a familiar word. Then you could make a story with the familiar words and you could remember it that way.<br>  <br>  It's the best to do the exams well first time rather than leaving it till the end. Start early and you don't have to do intensive revision every day but it is helpful to look through small notes to remind yourself. Best way to get confident in exams is to do a lot of practice papers, so you get used to the style and know what sort of things to expect. =)<br>  <br>  Of course don't do it excessively, have fun now and then as well. Little treats and rewards help as well. ;) Good luck! =)|`|7edvbjN5aa	study sst in the morning it helps a lot because u have to mug up the answers. study it for at least 2 hours. then take up other subjects you will have enough time to play if you organise your studies properly.|`|7U3wJphOaa	get up early and study in the morning hours ....keeps u fresh and a lot goes into your brains .....<br>  keep your evenings light and go to play

NUvc8VJMaa	LOVE means to give something to others without EXPECTING anything from them.|`|lUlfUeaKaa	there is no meaning for love.|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	The best definition I have heard is from Leo Bascaglia.  "Love is the conscious decision to put the welfare and happiness of another ahead of your own."|`|AA11813187	Love is any of a number of emotions and experiences related to a sense of strong affection and attachment<br>  <br>  Love is a strange thing. It can be the most amazing feeling in the world, or it can really hurt, but in the end love is something most, if not all of us, will face. While there are many different ways to define love and there are many different ways to love someone (even yourself).<br>  <br>  People who are truly in love do not insist that their way is best and demand that their mates give in to them<br>  <br>  Love can be divided into two parts.<br>  1. Impersonal love  and 2. Interpersonal love<br>  <br>  1. Impersonal love :- A person can be said to love a country, principle, or goal if they value it greatly and are deeply committed to it. Similarly, compassionate outreach and volunteer workers' "love" of their cause may sometimes be borne not of interpersonal love, but impersonal love coupled with altruism and strong political convictions. People can also "love" material objects, animals, or activities if they invest themselves in bonding or otherwise identifying with those things. If sexual passion is also involved, this condition is called paraphilia<br>  <br>  2. Interpersonal love :- refers to love between human beings. It is a more potent sentiment than a simple liking for another. Unrequited love refers to those feelings of love that are not reciprocated. Interpersonal love is most closely associated with interpersonal relationships. Such love might exist between family members, friends, and couples. There are also a number of psychological disorders related to love, such as erotomania.<br>  <br>  Interpersonal love depends upon the folowing :-<br>  1. Chemical basis :- Biological models of sex tend to view love as a mammalian drive, much like hunger or thirst. Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating, and involves the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and estrogen. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months. Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. <br>  <br>  2. Psychological basis :- Psychology depicts love as a cognitive and social phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg formulated a triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components: intimacy, commitment, and passion. Intimacy is a form in which two people share confidences and various details of their personal lives, and is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs.<br>  <br>  Inlast I would say Most Relationships fail not because of the absence of love..Love is always present..   Its just that, One loves too much, And the other loves too many,<br>  .|`|2BpkXSnqaa	A deep, tender, ineffable feeling of affection and solicitude toward a person, such as that arising from kinship, recognition of attractive qualities, or a sense of underlying oneness.?<br>  <br>  According to me , <br>  It is a very beautiful bond which ties the hearts of two people ????????|`|wbfBciSuaa	you wouldnt know it til you experienced it.|`|vHyYpRufaa	i really like the answer the person above me gave, i rele dont know what it means. i think saying you "love" someone well give you a personal meaning, when you feel something special with some1, then i think inside you know the meaning of love|`|py192S0Aaa	L- is for the way you *look*, at me.<br>  <br>  O- is for the *only one*, I see.<br>  <br>  V- is *very, very*, extra-ordinary.<br>  <br>  E- is *even* more than, anyone, that you adore.|`|EvyY3dUNaa	LOVE is beyond meanings..no words could express what actually love means..!

CXlqq0wPaa	Since you basically don't have to pay anything, I think you should go ahead and take it. You won't lose much if you take it and don't do so well. For the college apps, it depends on the college, but if you do really poorly, you may not even have to report it, especially if you have a lot of other APs. <br>  <br>  For APUSH, I don't think that a good teacher is as necessary as for other APs. The essays are pretty self-explanatory because two of them are open-ended, and the other is a DBQ, which isn't too bad.<br>  <br>  And now for the real advice: If you don't already have the 5 STEPS TO A 5 review book for APUSH, GET IT. I hardly ever paid attention in class, and I usually just skimmed the textbook, but reading that review book for like a few days before the exam saved my life. The practice tests in the back are also very similar to the exam; in fact, when I took it, a few questions were almost exactly the same. <br>  <br>  Buy the book, read it, take the AP exam, get a 5.|`|akjk0KDlaa	get those AP study guides from barnes and nobles. and study. just take it cuz as long as ur taking the class, u might as well take the AP exam|`|chfA4aK1aa	I dealt with this same dilemma when I took AP US History as well. Our teacher pretty much sat down the entire class period and we were forced to learn basically everything on our own. As long as you feel comfortable with the material, I would take it. The fee waiver is a plus. No matter what, even if you do poorly, it will not effect your college chances at all. Your AP classes and the fact that you took the tests will be an advantage for you. However, if you feel really uncomfortable with the material and don't think you know much of anything, I wouldn't bother. That's only if you really don't know anything though, which is unlikely. I chose not to take mine but classmates of mine took it and did fairly well, in spite of our lazy teacher. I wish I would have taken mine...<br>  <br>  Even the classmates that didn't do so well on the AP test still got into great schools. Your score will not affect you so bad that you won't even get into college.... I would suggest you take the test. Good luck.|`|843287d2583e018fc1b11389b96956bcaa	You should always take the exam it just depends on the score and if you decide to send them to certain schools. You should also take advantage of the fee waiver since you only have to pay 5 dollars whereas the original cost is 85 dollars. So it all depends on you but I highly recommend taking it regardless of whether or not you do well, granted a poor score may not be good on a transcript but some schools like the fact you are taking advantage of the tougher courses at your school.
