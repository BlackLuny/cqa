ATU2QDTSaa	Hey man, I just recently lost my ID too and for similar reasons to yours, could not go to the DMV or easily obtain one. There is hope! Go online and check out your state DMV website. If you know your social or you license/ID number, you can look up your information. <br>  <br>  Mine was a Florida license and I went online to the florida DMV. They have an online service where you could look up your info (using yous SS# or license# plus some other security questions) and you can buy a brand new ID for $10! If it was stolen file a police report and you can get a replacement for free. <br>  <br>  I would think that Maryland has something similar. If you are out of state they can also mail your a temporary 90 day ID. <br>  <br>  If you just need an ID card  check out this site from the Marlyland DMV site. Search around and I think you'll find what you are looking for! <br>  <br>  Hope it helps!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dmv.org/md-maryland/replace-license.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.dmv.org/md-maryland/replace-l...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.marylandmva.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.marylandmva.com/index.html</a><br>  <br>  <br>  After some more research it looks like you'll actually have to go in to an office.

vPeNKLK7aa	Whether your mum is wealthy or not will not prevent her being annoyed at you crashing your first car.  Get a cheap second-hand one while you learn road etiquette.  You'll probably find you prefer it to the very very very pretentious sports cars that "rich" people are frequently fooled into buying; more as a status symbol than a useful car.  You'll probably find the extra doors and the ability to carry luggage very useful too.  Evidence suggests that I am correct: just look at the number of cheap cars on the road!|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Surely it depends on what you can afford and what features you require in a vehicle.<br>  <br>  Most normal (non-rich) people go for a small old banger as their first car (an old VW Polo, Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa etc) so I would say ￡800 tops for something like that.<br>  <br>  Pay hard cash, don't even think about getting yourself into debt over a vehicle until you're older and well established in a secure job. (I'm assuming you're in your late teens or early twenties here.)<br>  <br>  Remember that if you're a new driver, you're in all probability going to crash it and scrape it a few times, so anything in shiny pristine condition is going to be a bit of a waste of money.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	Unless you are going to be driving it a lot, i wouldn't bother...<br>  <br>  You be spending the value of the car every year on insurance alone and it just isn't worth it unless you are actually using it.<br>  <br>  Get the bus.<br>  <br>  It help the environment and will save you a years accommodation at uni in a year or two.|`|907e3984a6f4f92078cc488022d7399daa	Depends what your budget is.

S4soZUFCaa	Splitting hairs over 5W30 and 10W30 is overkill. Won't make any difference except in your mind.|`|HFrsH9MRaa	WHat kind of car is this?????NEED MORE INFO!!!! Be aware that there are oils engineered for YOUR manufactured car. In other words, there are oils made to satisfy Honda requirements, Toyoate, requirements, Gm requirement, Ford requirements, ETC. Never use a bulk oil or an oil that isn't labeled for YOUR manufactured car brand!!! VW/Audi MUST have oil that meets specification 502/505 to satisfy warranty. If you go to a major auto parts chain, and examine each brand of oil, you will see that only a handful of oils are really WORTH BUYING!!!! Get Smart!!! Mobil One and ELF oils and some Amzoil products meet most specifications. Read your owner's manual!!!|`|f5ibT3WNaa	If the car calls for 5/30 stick with 5/30|`|BFIW3qGYaa	that doesn't matter just make sure you use a synthetic oil filter
S4soZUFCaa	Of course, it will be full of oil so watch it.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	you can but i fail to see why you would want to . if you are using any typical oil, the life of that oil is roughly 5000 miles. given the current technology in today's engines you will not develop enough material in the filter to create a situation that forces the system into bypass mode. i do this stuff for a living.|`|f5ibT3WNaa	You can do that but it defeats the purpose cause then your filtering oil with a dirty filter|`|a3838c0cd2f7f63124657ac7f4657dfbaa	No reason why you can't but what would be the point in that? No you will not loose all the oil. Just what is in the filter.|`|nAK8bm91aa	Yes you can, its your car.

AA10470911	The vehicle registration has to be paid in the State it is registered.  Most DMV's allow registration to be paid over the phone with a credit card or by mail. You can always purchase insurance for any vehicle but will have to list the registered owner on the policy as well. You will just be considered an authorized driver of the vehicle.|`|DyEIc0K8aa	It's easy to get insurance on the car (at least in my state). Just go to your insurance agent and he/she will get the insurance you want. What does make me wonder about your question is what you say the car has no title... how do you get plates and that also may make it hard to get insurance.
8f84b71a52fe1db0d395bc387d6c4b21aa	I'd look at a used Ninja 250R or similar.  It will have respectable performance, great for the price.  In the states we can get them for $1500 or so, which is about 1,100 pounds at the moment.
ZEwAalKPaa	You already have good answers regarding getting a replacement plate for your car.  As to selling your private plate - ebay, exchange and mart, auto-trader, specialist sales agencies.  but be aware, most so called private plates are totally meaningless to 99% of the population and unless they are very early issues, clearly make a name or car model they can take ages to sell, if they ever do. Most private plates i have seen would be passed by without comment or being noticed by most people and really only mean anything to the person who bought it.|`|AA11510511	You need to contact the DVLA.<br>  <br>  You will need to pout your private plates on retention.  Get a certificate for this.<br>  <br>  You will then have to re-register the car. It will NOT have the original plate, but will get one that matches the year of registration.|`|TiW72sAUaa	You need to contact your local DVLA office and request a retention form, I think you can also print one off their website. You can then retain your plate for upto a year. They will issue the new plate for your car and a certificate confirming your plate has been retained along with a new tax disk for your car.<br>  <br>  They will also send you your new V5 doc with the new registration on and a cert giving permission to have the new plates made up.|`|0LUBf2Juaa	You can put the the original plate back on your car and have your private plate held on a retention certificate while you sell it. This will ensure that once you have sold the plate, you won't have to make the buyer wait while you do the exchange through the DVLA.<br>  Go onto the DVLA website for more information.|`|jz9cqjZpaa	contact dvla via there website

They shouldnt be allowed to charge people for crimes against them but thats life unfortunately.|`|AA10582974	Same thing in the US<br>  It was considered an abanded vehicle until the police found the rightful owner.<br>  You have to pay the towing company that picked it up and got it off the street.|`|IMPh53Ssaa	friggin impound lots make money for the city, its a scam, but they work with the government you gotta pay it if you want it back|`|aafTqjV1aa	Afraid you are screwed, bubba!<br>  #1 Foresics finished with it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA! I guarantee that only happens on T.V. The police found the bike, verified it was stolen, and called the towing company they had a contract with to come and pick it up.  The towing company picks up the vehicle, takes it to their lot, and you pay all the charges. I guarantee the cops never even touched the bike. (Unless they had to tip if over to check the VIN number. If the plates were still on it, they didn't even do that.)<br>   #2. The B.S. about the forensics? That was so the towing company can keep it an extra day! Remember, they are charging you to pick the bike up, and also there is a daily charge for storage. <br>  #3. IF YOU EVER HAVE ANOTHER ACCIDENT, HAVE THE BIKE OR CAR TOWED RIGHT TO YOUR HOME! That way you only have the initial towing charge. Plus a dedicated bike tow co. is far more careful, even with wrecked bikes.  They usually have padded straps, hold-downs, supports, etc. The regular towing co. that did yours probably threw a cable around it, and dragged it onto a flatbed truck.<br>  #3. Pay to get the bike back right now. Have some friends with a truck, or call a motorcycle towing company to pick it up and bring it hom. Here in Tucson, the local motorcycle transport company charges $35 to pick up a bike and take it to your house. (Or the dealer, if you have a warranty) I think that would be about 15 lbs in English money.<br>  #4. Maybe your towing places are honest, but it sure doesn't sound like it. Here in Tucson, the towing company that has the contract for recovering wrecks and derelicts has the reputation of taking anything valuable that is left in the car, and when you ask about it, they just say "It must have happened before we got there" I know one guy who went to recover his car and noticed a guy in the fenced lot taking the stereo right out of it. They were trying to get it out before he showed up. <br>  It's bad all the way around. Get your bike back before the charges can go any higher, unless you don't care about it anymore. It depends on how bad they damaged it. (Plus the damage the towing company does.)

I bet it will take a whole whack of accidents for someone to finally say that they should be illegal|`|EmgiGg17aa	Pink ones sound interesting.  Maybe you should take off your sunglasses?  Headlights were  for the most part mainly yellowish(from the factory.   Then Bosch lites were whiter and brighter.  Aircraft landing lights are even brighter.(but illegal on cars).<br>  The blueish one are suppose to light up the road better(cop cars had them).<br>  Manufacturers are searching for the best headlight for less accidents at night.   <br>    Personally, I can't see why.  In town, every street is lit up so you could drive home with no headlights and never even notice that they are not on.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	The reason that they are legal is because the law only says what the minimum brightness is that the headlights must be; it does not say what the maximum brightness is that they are allowed to be.|`|AA11914369	What makes you think they are legal?  If the vehicle comes from the factory that way, they are legal.  If it's added on, it isn't.  That's the general rule, and seems to apply in all states.|`|wpgRMjgraa	The blue looking ones that come from the factory are legal but all of the rest that are aftermarket are illegal in most states and yes they cause a big distraction as well.|`|eceLQUj5aa	Most times they aren't, those people just haven't been caught yet.

I've seen bad owners have cars that break down before they reach 100,000. Just depends on how well you take care of the car.<br>  <br>  Think of it like asking "what people live a long time?". There's no specific type, beside those people that stay healthy, eat well, etc.
BFIW3qGYaa	more then likely it's your fuel Pump on it's way out get it checked out i doubt the line is frozen if you were able to start it and drive that means fuel was going to the engine|`|AA11404742	I'm iffy on the "frozen fuel line" diagnosis.  It's possible, but unlikely, as most all fuel sold in the US has alcohol in it already.  And that's whats in the fuel line antifreeze that you added.<br>  <br>  It could be a fuel problem.  You may have a weak fuel pump, or a plugged filter.  What kind of car is it, and how old is it?  Has it been running poorly before this?|`|f5ibT3WNaa	It would help if we knew the car you were driving. It sounds like a fuel pump issue though. If the fuel was frozen you wouldnt have made it to the gas station.|`|TnMnqZaaaa	Your problem seems to be your fuel pump.  Get somebody that knows more about cars to check it out for you.|`|HqcbeHmhaa	awer|`|nAK8bm91aa	Try this, remove the battery cables for 15 minutes. Clean the cables with battery terminal cleaner.<br>  If it is a carb, drop a tea spoon of gas in the carb then start, if no start, Use starter fluid in the carb. <br>  Could be the fuel line has frozen. If this is the case, you will not be able to start the car until thawed.<br>  Always use STP water remover or pure rubbing alcohol in the gas, this separates the water from the gas also. 12-16 ounces is enough.

The title probably specifies the number of doors, too. <br>  <br>  Why does this matter anyway?|`|424a60ac5e610af2c4c213d4f9b78debaa	So you now have a 318is, and you were wondering if it will be registered as a 318i?<br>  <br>  Not exactly sure why you're worried. The VIN number will have all the information they need. But yes, there are a number of differences.<br>  <br>  For starters, the value of a coupe is always going to be higher than a 4-door sedan. There are also a bunch of design and technical differences.
reLtReUSaa	You should also consider that such a car may be expensive to insure. Check your insurance rates before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com|`|mqezKdfeaa	you could try craigslist or something like that
E0j6mhqhaa	You rotated the clutch assembly 90 degrees?  So did you remove the cover over the clutch and rotate the basket or what?  Did you check the clutch cable and make sure it wasn't hung up where it attaches to the clutch release shaft?  If it's like older Kaws, the lever on the shaft rotates forward to release the clutch.  If it's hung up that will prevent it from returning to the rear position and engaging the clutch.  <br>  <br>  If your bike has a manual clutch linkage with cable, having too little free play in the clutch can rotate the release shaft too far forward and cause it to stick.  If your bike has a hydraulic clutch and the clutch is still released, crack open the hydraulic hose at a fitting on the engine side and see if the clutch engages as fluid squirts out.  Don't let if squirt on anything painted.  It it does release, crack the fitting at the master cylinder end.  If it now doesn't release, you have a bad hose that has swelled up on the inside.  If it releases when either end is cracked but doesn't release otherwise, then you have a master cylinder problem.|`|ghaETYwcaa	well the only thing I can think of is get a shop manual and disassemble your clutch to find the problem.
qGpD9ntNaa	For starters when looking a car that old NADA value does not mean anything. The car is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it. And a cadillac eldorado is not a car many people really want does not mean its not a good choose I LOVE Cadillacs<br>  <br>  The first thing you should do is crawl under the car and look for rust damage. Make sure that the frame is still intact and not starting to rust through (if it is do not even consider buying this car) check the floor boards and see how bad they are rusted. the exterior rust is not a huge deal it is easy enough to fix. Does the car run and shift good. any car that old is going to have a lot of problems. And all of the problems you listed are not really that hard of a fix. <br>  <br>  Yes those cars are pretty rare and they do sell sell for  a lot of money. Do not undersestimate how much work it is to restore an old car. If you are up for it the challenge GO FOR IT|`|efad8b1ede4a36c25f7ed32273efa609aa	If your looking at purchasing that vehicle for that much, I would say your crazy.

I think they built somewhere around 15,000 of them (thats just the converts)  That was more than double any other year.  Are you sure the ones you see on ebay are selling?  Or are they just asking that much?   In showroom condition they are certainly worth 10K+ but I think it would cost you at least that much to bring the one you are describing anywhere near that and you would then have 16K into it and still only have a 10K car.   What part of the world are you in?<br>  <br>  Thats WAY high if you are in the USA or at least North America, away from there I have no idea, that could be a steal for all I know.<br>  <br>  If it was not a convert that would be an under $1000 car.   Being a convert adds a bit of value but not that much.  For $6500 you should get a car that looks pretty darn good from 20 feet away or going 20 miles per hour.  Closer look may show some flaws.  Same with the interior, it will look used but should have no major problems and I would also expect 95% of the accessories to work.    I bought a 73 convert 2 years ago that sounds about like the one you are describing for $1400.  I tried to sell it last year for $1000 with no luck so I found another place to store it and will likely just keep it for parts for the other 3 I currently own.|`|tt9bwlg5aa	Typical problems for a car 30+ years old. As far as the price... It would be hard to get this much money out of that particular car without the mentioned problems. I would suspect that it would be worth far more than that to you once repaired. I know how it is with favorite cars. I still own the 70 Nova bought for my 1975 high school graduation.|`|iz9hzHN7aa	These sound like pretty standard problems for a car that old. unless it's a convertible, the price is way too high. personally I wouldn't spend over $1,000 on it. Do some research on closed auctions on ebay for similar cars (similar year Lincolns) and see what you find.|`|34f58d193a1c27340e8401a3848c8c53aa	For a project car that seems a little bit too high. I could expect to see it running around the 1-3 thousand mark for a car that's going to need that much. It would need a full off the frame restoration. Plus with it being a convertible. Your not sure what is all hiding underneath the surface. The low value from the nada guild lines show that the car wouldn't need much work that you can see. like paint, interior, rust, and mechanical. The site even has the disclaimer under it saying. This value does not represent a "parts car". Which more or less this car would fall into the parts car category. The reason for the cars having such a high value is the fact that yes it is an antique. Plus the coupes, and hardtops of the B-body in the 70's where, and still are great for demolition derby. the guys saying the car value being around a thousand are not that far off. Other GM makes of that body style are going any where from 500 to 1500. completely stripped.

They LOVE to get A&P's, because they know a lot technically, and generally have experience with hydraulics, etc. There's high pay, bonuses, excellent working conditions, and no more worrying about the feds.I would say there are more A&P's working in non-aviation fields than in aviation right now.  <br>  You could also get into medical equipment manufacturing, heavy equipment maintenance, or maybe apply at an electric company to be a powerplant operator.

I won't recommend 10lbs I would go with 5-7lbs of boost. The plus your going to have to run the motor on synthetic motor oil and prenium gas.|`|mwu6aJuyaa	If you leave your engine with stock internals. you can run 5 to 10 lbs. But it will harm your engine. It might not harm in right away, but i promise you the lifespan will be much less with a turbo on it. It's more heat, more stress, more pressure. More wear and tear. Also, if your going to do a turbo, you should really consider what other work is required to have a turbo work correctly. It's not just a bolt on part. There are tons of things you should have done to the engine. You need more fuel, so you need a better fuel pump, fuel rail, ignition system, wires, plugs, all that. you need it to breath better so you need free flow exhaust, and an intake, you need the intercooler to keep the temps down. You need better oil to keep the turbo lubricated. You need a tuned ECU so that it knows it's got boost and how to make power with it. You should have a different cam, better cylinder head, better valvesprings, seals, Don't think your headgasket wont be under more stress. And no, these are not cheap parts. Mind you, with all that done, you could run 20+ lbs of boost. with nothing done, your going to hurt your engine, and not even get all the performance out of your turbo. Just some food for thought.
YupMCYHlaa	Yes a Katana is a good choice.  It is not a real, deadly serious, single purpose sport bike, it's really a 'sporty' general purpose bike.  It will be more forgiving, easier to ride, and more comfortable, especially on a long ride.  Then after a while if you just HAVE to have a street-racing bike, you can move to the GSX-R or CBR or R1/R6.<br>  <br>  And Suzuki is a good manufacturer, they make good stuff.  The SV-650 is more my style, but to each his own.<br>  <br>  I would suggest for a starter bike you don't go bigger than 650cc.  And you don't want to go out and buy a shiny new bike, you want one a few  years old, perhaps even with a few scrapes and bruises.  After a year or so you can sell it for about what you paid for it, and by then you'll know better what you really want.  The Katana is no longer made, and that fact alone lowers its value on the used market.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|miyAb7cQaa	No I think a Ninja 250R would be a better choice.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	I really like the Katana, I consider it a sport bike but it's actually almost a touring bike, it's bigger and heavier than most sport bikes.<br>  <br>  Have you ridden a sport bike before? I have lots of friends who have bought them and then regret it and tell me they prefer cruisers after having ridden both. Sport bikes are fun but not comfortable and you can't really ride with a passenger, at least not safely or comfortably. <br>  <br>  What kind of riding are you doing? If you like zipping around fast or just commuting a sport bike could work. If you want to go on long rides on the weekend, ride wtih your gf, etc a cruiser is better for you.|`|aafTqjV1aa	I'm not sure what a Katana is, but if it's one of those 'Crotch Rockets" forget it. Get a Honda 650, or low end Yamaha. Also, take a motorcycle safety course. If you buy a really  nice bike right off, you will be very sorry when you lay it down. (AND YOU WILL) especially if you haven't taken the safety course. The courses are put on by your local community college, or possibly a local dealer sponsors them.<br>  So for your first couple years of riding, get a bike with only average hp. maybe a used one that is in good condition. (Have the local dealer check it over and give it a servicing) There  are a lot of really good bikes out there for $1000  to $2000 that will do you fine. After you ride for awhile, if you find out your really like it, you can step up to a bike with more "personality". If you had the course and you've ridden awhile, you'll be much better at handling a higher powered bike.<br>  Forget about Harleys until you have a couple of years in. In Tucson we have what I call "Thursday Syndrome". Guys with money but no sense pick up a brand new Harley on Thursday, drive it that day and Friday, and get killed on Saturday. One guy here bought him and his wife matching Harleys, and picked them up on a Friday. They went out riding on Saturday, and she couldn't negotiate a turn and went head on into a pickup truck going the other direction. Less than 12 hours between picking up the bike and getting killed. Of course, these are all people who skipped the safety course, too. I'm not trying to scare you off, I just want you to be very cautious when you get out there. I love motorcycles, and if I don't ride for a few days I get really grumpy. It's great, like flying at low level.<br>  P.S. You don't need a motorcycle to take the safety course. They generally provide everything except a solid pair of shoes or boots.<br>  Check into it. A lot of places, if you take the safety course, you are automatically endorsed for you motorcycle  certificate on your license, so you just take your course certificate down to the DMV, and they take your picture and give you a new license with your motorcycle endorsement on it. No road test or anything. (You'll get all that in the course, with experienced instructors to help you out and provide good advice.) Good Luck!. You'll enjoy motorcycling!

No, they're not the smoothest nor the quietest but they are decent for what they are, an entry level economy car that has decent interior room, good fuel economy, peppy engine, and is relatively cheap and easy to work on.<br>  Whether you decide to buy this Neon or any other used car, the one thing I advise you to do is have the vehicle inspected prior to purchase by a trusted shop or mechanic.  Spending a few bucks on a pre-purchase inspection can save you hundreds or even thousands later on.

Failure to disclose any previous medical condition (however small or seemingly insignificant) is considered fraud and is grounds for immediate certificate revocation/suspension.<br>  <br>  A previous diagnosis of depression is not a death sentence, however it may require a waiver from the FAA, which can be time-consuming.  If you find an AME that will give you a medical, you're off the hook though.

If it's just a click, it's probably one of the CV joints on that side.  I recommend replacing the half axle.  The difference in price in labor should cover the extra cost of the half axle (don't let them talk you into rebuilding it there).  If they tell you it cost a lot more for the half axle than to rebuild yours (the axle part price shouldn't cost more than about whatever $150 in Pounds is), tell them to sod off [is that the right Brit term, or is it piss off (the second one means to make angry here)?].  At least it doesn't cost more than that here.<br>  <br>  You should avoid turning the wheel completely to the stops unless you must.  That wears the stops and puts unnecessary strain on the rack.<br>  <br>  Bad news on the transmission.  Get the fluid level checked.  If it isn't that you could try having its fluid and filter replaced.  If that doesn't do it, that means a repair ($$$$).  You might want to have a used one installed instead, if you have a reliable source for those.

botH6rIQaa	has it been sitting awhile?  Sounds like condensation...in the tank and carb,  in which case I would drain the old gas from the tank an carb and refill.|`|E0j6mhqhaa	If your bike has a carb, does it do this with the choke still partially  closed?  With the choke open (turned off), does it hesitate while the engine is not yet fully warmed up?  If it runs better while the engine is still somewhat cool and worse when the engine is warmed up well, then it's certainly not running too lean.  Too lean mixtures run better after the engine is warmed up and too rich run better before the engine gets warmed up.<br>  <br>  If your bike has a carb, even when fully warmed up, close the choke just a bit and see if the hesitation goes away.  If so, then there's something that's causing it to run too lean such as a change in pipes, air filter or carb.  Not all carbs have accellerator pumps but if yours does, reddishpa might have the right answer.<br>  <br>  If your bike has fuel injection, something even experienced bike mechanics often miss is the check valve being bad in the return fuel line.  It should be screwed into the bottom of the tank.|`|48eb2dbb79fba479784347026d54127daa	If it has a carb, check the accelerator pump.|`|ah60PElRaa	the carbuerater is jetted in a very lean condition to decrease emmissions, it happens just after idle when the engine is spinning up. you can change your driving habit by letting the engine get up to a slightly higher RPM and releasing the clutch later rather than sooner.<br>  <br>  or you can take your bike to a independant shop and they can tune your carb so it runs properly. if there is emmisions testing for motorcycles in your state it probably wont pass but no one really checks motorcycle emmissions and EVERYONE does a "stage 1" to harleys to get rid of that problem and increase useable power|`|13qub401aa	That is one of the reasons, you rev up your bike before take off. A HD carb. is set abit on the lean side from the factory. Have your Air fuel mixture tuned.|`|n9HUANkiaa	don't they all?|`|mWW09DF1aa	i would say check the a/f mixure. pull the plug and check for signs...white=lean, black=rich...should be yellowish brown. also make sure the choke isn't sticking...other than that replace the plugs, check the air filter and make sure you have good fuel. Good luck!

That means enjoying the scenery and stopping when you feel like it. Drive only during the daytime. Give yourself about 4 days to make the trip. Decide each day where you want to stop for fuel (don't go below a half tank), food or a break and where you want to bed down for the night.<br>  <br>  Having made the trip from GA to CA, I would estimate a cost of between 200 - 250 per day or 800 to 1000 for the trip. That is for food, fuel and lodging. If you are not real confident in your vehicle, I would double the amount. Join the Auto Club and take advantage of their terrific maps, tour guides and trip tiks plus roadside assistance. Make sure that you map your route out before starting.<br>  <br>  All the best.

I think if you consider the fact that the lights on the rear of a car are reflective, but the clear lights on the front are not, it only makes sense to park with traffic. Also, how would you ever get out without going the wrong way or blocking traffic. And not to mention, as another driver, how would you know if the car was off or not, i'm sure it would freek oncoming traffic out.|`|JXsbiZ38aa	Certain vehicles can be exempted from Traffic Regulation Orders which are required for one way streets. These can include emergency service vehicles, gully cleaners, bin wagons and some highway maintenance vehicles.<br>  The exemptions are written into specific orders and the term 'parking' would not be used although they may actually be stationary.<br>  I cannot see this being the answer you seek because this information is not usually known by the public.|`|AA11697737	In order to park in the manner described surely you would have had to have driven up the one way street in the wrong direction, which I seem to recall is illegal.<br>  <br>  Anyway the Highway code quite clearly states:<br>  <br>  Rule 239<br>  <br>  Use off-street parking areas, or bays marked out with white lines on the road as parking places, wherever possible.

YwdsP4c2aa	Remove two bolts from bottom of suspension leg, also remove brake calliper, withdraw the hub in its entirety, secure calliper with a cable tie to spring on suspension leg, remove the two bolts at the rear of the wishbone on the rubber mount retainer. Remove the two nuts attaching the ball joints to the chassis, if you are refitting with existing ball joints use a ball joint splitter for this purpose, if not insert a large bar between chassis and wishbone and prise it off the chassis.<br>  <br>  If you do renew the ball joints you will probably need to get the wheels tracked.<br>  <br>  For the avoidance of doubt the reason why the wishbone (front control arm) won't come off is because you have to split the ball joints attaching it to the chassis.<br>  <br>  Oh dear a thumbs down.

17236f2a8f333b3a2a3252e2a5c82aabaa	This is dangerous territory. When you buy a car from a private party is is absolutely necessary that the seller can hand you a CLEAR title to the vehicle at the time of the sale. A CLEAR title means that the car is currently registered in the sellers name, and does not have any liens against it. If the seller can't provide you with a CLEAR title walk away from the deal. It would be asking for trouble because you could not register the car in your name.<br>  <br>  Once you have obtained a CLEAR title, take it, the Bill of Sale, and possibly an odometer certification, and emissions  certification to your local DMV to transfer the title into your name and register the car. You may have to pay sales tax on the purchase of the car also.|`|jqaFMtVgaa	The previous owner signs the title, usually on the back somewhere. You sign the title.

fZjgIE9Baa	First off, college. Not all airlines require a degree. Several of the "regional" airlines don't require a degree. However, most of the "majors" do. So where do you want to end up? Charter flying and other corporate flying has a policy on a per-company basis. But if you have it, it may put you ahead of someone who doesn't.<br>  <br>  Air Force.  You'll be committed to them for no less than 10 years. Are you prepared to devote that time? Not to mention you'll be IN the military and may have to deploy, fight, and possibly pay the ultimate sacrifice. It may be for you, it may not.<br>  <br>  If you do choose college, then the question is do you chose an "aviation university" or not. Aviation Universities include Embry Riddle, Auburn University, along with many more. OR, you can choose to attend an "airline academy" which will be independent of a 4 year degree but will have you ready from start to ready for an airline interview in XX number of days/months.  These include Delta Connection Academy <br>  <br>  Anyway, to be competitive for a regional airline right now you will ultimately need (in terms of flight experience) your Commercial Multi Airplane license with an Instrument rating at probably AT LEAST 800 hours of flight time of which at least 100 hours should be in a multi-engine airplane.<br>  <br>  If you go to one of the academy's be prepared to spend around $25,000 up front (or within a few months) to get that commercial multi.... Other wise, if you obtain the licenses/ratings as you go the following will become familiar terms to you:<br>  -- Private Pilot License<br>  -- Instrument Rating<br>  -- Commercial License<br>  -- Multi-Engine license/add-on<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor (CFI)<br>  -- Certified Flight Instructor Instrument (CFII)<br>  -- Advanced Ground Instructor (AGI)<br>  -- Multi-Engine Flight Instructor (MEI)<br>  <br>  I would also recommend www.aopa.org to investigate learning to fly. If you do go to a local flight school, I recommend something called a "Discovery Flight."<br>  <br>  The list goes on. If you want to ask specific questions, feel free to send me an email.|`|UlZmzLrvaa	Yes, you can. The best way to start your carrier is to find an FAA approved flight school or a flight training academy first. Make sure the school offers flight instructor certificates. This way you can build hours and also gain considerable experience. It may be expensive but many schools offer the opportunity to work as a paid flight instructor right in the school after you graduate. 250 hrs is not enough to get a job in the airline industry, especially these days.|`|pIQ5LPW4aa	Make sure you love it. Make sure you have money. Make sure you have a BS Degree. These are the real stepping stones. If you dont truly love aviation you cant make the sacrifices required to obtain a BS Degree, Spend ALL your money and time obtaining the certificates just to get a low paying job initially.<br>  <br>  Basicly, you dont need to be from the military, however the military will pay for your very expensive training. If you dont want to go that route, go get your BS degree while you are working on your ratings from either a part 141 or 61 flight school. Most local airports are willing to give you the proper flight training. Compare rental rates though, some are alot more costly then others. Also join a flight club if you can, the rental rates will be lower and you can network with others like you.|`|ZTMjXz1saa	Less than half of the airline pilots out there have military experience.  Those days of needing military experience are long gone.<br>  <br>  I honestly don't know how much multi time you need these days to get hired at an airline, but 250 sounds like a lot for a regional.  Shortly after 9/11, the multi requirements were like that though.  How one got it?  Paid for it.  Worked at a flight school that taught in twins (that's what I did).  Begged for it.  There's no easy way to twin time as all CFIs are always on the lookout for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|DvlwN9kdaa	No.  <br>  <br>  Most airline pilots are not former military pilots.<br>  <br>  250 hours is not enough flight time to be hired as an airline pilot. <br>  <br>  Work at entry level pilot jobs until you have enough knowledge, experience, and flight time.

You can take a free calss through your local DMV and learn on their 250's without you having to buy one.<br>  <br>  I would recommend starting off on nothing smaller than a 500 or 600. I started off on an 800 having never ridden a bike before and had no problems. Sure the power is surprising at first but once you get used to it your glad you have it, plus spend some time getting comfortable on side streets and parking lots before going out on open roads. <br>  <br>  Also keep in mind until everything you do riding is reaction and not thinking your not safe. Just like in a car you automaticcaly slam the breaks or swerve when soemthing comes up on you quick you need to have that same automatic response on a bike.<br>  <br>  For beginner bikes I'd recommend the Yamaha V-Star 600, Honda Shadow 600.|`|YwDJVWwVaa	it honestly all depends on what kind of riding you want to do.

Power isn't what you need most on a starter bike.  (600cc supersports are def. not good starters...)|`|b9c206476271de6c0a321ebe042eb7f6aa	At your height, get a used Kawasaki Ninja 500.<br>  If you really want a cruiser, get the Kawasaki Vulcan 500.|`|YupMCYHlaa	The Rebel is really a good bike, but because it's so pretty used ones go for a lot of money.  The 250 Virago is about equivalent.  I don't think the Shadow comes in a size that small, but it is also a very good bike.  I am a Honda lover myself but all the Japanese brands are pretty good.<br>  <br>  If you only plan to go 'a bit' on the highway, maybe like 10 miles at a time, you don't need anything more than a 250.  But if you're into cruisers, they are easier to manage in the bigger sizes because they have such a low center of gravity, so don't be afraid to step up to a 650 or 750.  A 750 sport bike is a rocket ship, a 750 cruiser is just a nice cruiser. 8^)  Cruisers are also safer, probably because of the way they're ridden, they're not designed to push the edge of the envelope, like sports bikes are.  So they're a good choice to learn on.<br>  <br>  Also at 5'11 you might find a Rebel or any 250 a little cramped.  You want to sit on one to see how you like it.  Put it on the center stand (if it has one) and sit with your feet on the pegs and your hands on the handlebars, and ask yourself 'Could I sit like this for 2 or 3 hrs?'<br>  <br>  Also, if you only plan to use the bike to go to school or work, consider that you're going to fall in love with it and want to go for long day-rides on the weekends, so it's probably better to go with a bigger bike to begin with. 8^)

a47cAPypaa	If you are using that amount of oil without any leaks then engine must burning it. This can either be oil leaking through the valve stems or excessive wear on the cylinder bore. Usually when burning oil you notice blue smoke from the exhaust especially going down hill with your foot off the accelerator, as you start to accelerate you then get a puff of blue smoke.|`|808f8239addd67976faf828dba2a4992aa	if ti does not burn it then the PVC valve may be defective or the rear valve cover gasket is leaking and at high speeds blows it out the gasket and when stopped you won't see a leak as the oil is blown away from the engine and drops on the ground, so look at the bottom of the car and see if it's wet if it is that's your problem. That is as long as it's not smoking.|`|214a84419a27f7b719e60de8e61dbd12aa	Worn out Piston Rings:|`|AA10851094	If it isn't leaking oil then it must be burning it. Have it thoroughly checked by a good shop. If you notice any bluish colored smoke that would be a sign of burning oil from the tail pipe. It could be bad piston rings, bad valve guide seals or valve guides (especially if it is the 3.0 litre Mitsubishi engine) but in any case something is wrong to be using that much oil so you need to have it checked out.|`|1yUwfuneaa	burning oil, which usually indicates that your engine is just worn out if you dont have any leaks.|`|9WvqA5zDaa	does it smoke out the tail pipe|`|AA10331598	That's an incredible amount of oil.  At that rate you should have smoke rolling out of the tailpipe!  I think it is possible that your oil dipstick tube has shifted, and the oil level you are reading on the stick may not be accurate.<br>  <br>  Here is the key question:  When you change the oil and filter, and you put the correct amount of oil in it, does the dipstick register full? (I assume this is 5 qts).  or do you have to add additional oil to register full?  If dipstick registers low after you change the oil, you should suspect and innacurate dipstick.<br>  <br>  Also, when checking the oil, it is best to do so after the engine has been turned off for a few minutes, this way, all the oil has time to return to the pan.  Checking the oil immediately after turning off the engine (Such as at the gas station) can cause a false low reading.<br>  <br>  I do not doubt that your vehicle is consuming oil, but 2-3 qts in 3000mile should make a LOT a smoke.

The display light is burned out and not a customer replaceable item. You would need to send the unit to an electronic repair shop that works on radios and have them replace the burned out light or led/display which is soldered in the circuit. Too much money to bother with repairing.<br>  Put the old fuse or another new fuse back in and make sure you did not put the fuse in an empty spot next to the radio fuse position.<br>  If the radio does not work but the word CODE is shown in the display (I take it the display can be seen with a flashlight) you put the radio in the theft mode and need to program the radio code back into the radio. Go to the dealer.

The 80 in the rears sounded a tad high to me, but one of my wheel straighteners who drives one tells me that they run just fine that way.|`|z2qlDnnDaa	Typically a tire needs at least 35 psi to keep from wearing excessively.  Take into account what you will be using your Suburban for.  If you are going to be doing a lot of heavy towing and putting heavier loads or filling the vehicle with passengers you will want to have more air in the tires.  Putting too much air in the tires will cause the center of the tires to wear more than the outer edges.  Putting too little air in the tires will wear the outside edges.  If it were my vehicle and for everyday moderate use I would run air pressures of 40-45 psi and then pump the pressure up if I was pulling a trailer or caring larger loads.

Go drive a Viper every day, it isn't happening.  It's crude and has no street manners.  Cool car?  Absolutely, hardly worth the price when new.  Vettes suck at handling?  I'd LOVE LOVE LOVE to race you around the twisties in my C5...better gas mileage?  LOL   Dude the Viper is a GAS hog.  Are you seriously that clueless?

Also, at 16 you're bound to get into at least a little fender bender, do you really want to risk messing up a $30K+ car while you really learn to drive?  I'd highly suggest getting something you don't care about as much, something that won't upset you if it gets hit in the parking lot or you hit something by accident.<br>  <br>  I would wait a year or two to really get comfortable driving then go for it(provided you can afford it).|`|64d33b21525c267f9af9181ffa2d6014aa	I agree with everybody else to a point, but not just because of performance.  If you want a performance car and are willing to learn how to drive it responsibly then more power to you.  I had a fast car when I was young, but it was a '55 Chevy that I purchased and built myself.  Keep in mind that this was a long time ago, so shoebox Chevy's were nowhere near the prices they are now.  I worked two part time jobs during high school and full time during the summer.  I put every dime I made and nearly all of my free time into that car.  I respected the performance because I knew that if I wrecked it, everything that I worked for would be lost.  I had by far the fastest car in high school, but I didn't go through a pair of rear tires every month or beat the heck out of it like the kids with brand new Camaro's did.  Start out with something like a C4 Corvette that you can build yourself and be proud of.  A C4 can be built to perform on par with a C6 for half the cost.|`|mo8YBvC4aa	definately is a bad idea, high school kids are the worst if they get even the slightest temptation. high performance driving school won't help a thing you just need experience driving in general...i def think you should wait a few yrs until you have experience under your belt...good luck|`|d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	you got the dough then go for it, but the insurance for a 16 year old is pretty high..the sportier the car the higher the bill...good luck!|`|NAZeTH0Maa	Well I love exotics,tuners,muscle and luxury cars just as much as you (probably more) but if this is gonna be your 1st car I say no.Thats a good thing you wanna go to driving school before you get behind the vette but I really dont see things ending up good for a 16 yr old in a 500HP sports car.Check out this site www.wreckedexotics.com theres plenty of wrecked beauties like the Corvette,Ferrari,Lamborghini,Porsche,Ast... Martin etc etc.Its what happens when people buy fast cars and they cant control them.i say start out small and buy something like a 09 CHevy Cobalt SS Coupe.The car has a 2.0 liter turbochared inline 4 engine that produces 260HP which will get to 60mph in way under 6sc and top out at 160mph.You'll save about 30 grand and still have a cool fast ride.Wait until your about 30 to consider a vette.|`|ESAVdvdxaa	I can understand where you are coming from except that is too powerful and dont think it is the ideal car for someone of your age. Yes, it may be cool, but it is way too powerful, you dont have much experience. Also consider the fact it has a rather large engine. This you should think of considering you are young like me, and the environment should be taken into consideration. We are the latest generation doesnt mean we can carry on like our parents.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|z2qlDnnDaa	Yeah a Vette is cool.  Consider a few things.  Where do you live?  What do your friends drive?  What do you and your friends do for fun?  If you live in an area that sees lots of snow or rain then a Vette isn't much good to you.  If your friends driver 4x4's and you go mud bogging then a Vette isn't much good to you.  If you and your friends pile into a car to go out on the town, a Vette only holds you and one other person.  If you are buying the car for popluarity or status then you are buying it for the wrong reasons.  The car will not buy you this.  Remember, you have to fix it, insure it, and put gas in it..high octane gas.|`|TzPofCDxaa	No, no, no.<br>  <br>  It will hurt you badly.

Your scenario of being on-duty, not driving for 13 hours, allows you to drive providing it only occurs once every cycle.

AA11404742	Do you have a car now?  Is it paid for?  Is it reliable?<br>  <br>  If so, I'd stick with that.  If you're in college, you probably won't be driving much, so there's not a lot of wear to cause more problems.<br>  <br>  If you do need to buy a car, I'd look at a used one.  It's a lot less money than a new one, and it's cheaper to insure, too.  You can find a mechanic to check the car over for you if you find a vehicle you like.  It's not a hassle, it might save you a ton of money.  <br>  <br>  Use the website below to find a shop in your area that people have recommended.  This is the cartalk website.  These are the guys on the cartalk call-in show on NPR, and it's free to use.  These are shops recommended by people all over the US as decent, honest, and trustworthy.<br>  <br>  you can also spend a few bucks and get a carfax report on the car.  This can tell you if it's been damaged and repaired, like a major accident, fire, flood damage, etc.  Again, it will cost you just a bit, but it could save you a lot in the long run.  Think of it as an investment.|`|jUdqsRfOaa	If you are going to get a used car, get a carfax report, those are great, but usually i think new cars are better, but if you must, don't go to some Joe or Bob's car dealership kind of thing, go to a real legit one.|`|sAJfK0K4aa	I would definitely agree with the other response here: buy used! You save a ton of money! Plus, you let someone else deal with depreciation costs that happen in the first couple of years a new car is bought. Try out Carsala. This is an excellent company to use if you don't want to travel from dealership to dealership searching for that right car and you don't have to haggle with the car salesmen when negotiating the price. Carsala will locate the car for you and call each dealership and negotiate the lowest possible price. All you need to do is go to the dealership and test drive the car, if you like it, walk off the lot with the price Carsala negotiated for you.

EVHr4VpCaa	I approach travel as an experience.   It is an experience in which I do not know exactly how it will be played out.  <br>  <br>  With that frame of mind, flight delays are just an occasional part of the package.  But most of the time, things go pretty much as scheduled.  <br>  <br>  I booked my first air travel in 1981 and over the years have been all over the world.  I've never really been unhappy in an airliner.<br>  <br>  I agree.  It's a great thing and we all should be more appreciative.|`|AOPuoo16aa	People will always find something to complain about. I can understand that people get upset when they have to sit for 8 hours on the ground. But I have seen people start freaking out when the get delayed for 15min. Personally I don't like being delayed but It still beets sitting in the car for 10hours when I can take a 2 hour flight.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	The flight is 'kinda' pleasant.<br>  it's the air-port preliminaries that are the horror story.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	You shouldn't be generalizing about people.  Most of us take what comes and basically accept the fact that from time to time we will be inconvenienced.<br>  <br>  I think that it is just a very small percentage of people who love to complain and make a scene over the most trivial matters.  The check out line is too long or the waiter took too long to bring their food, or the airplane was 15 minutes late.  So they scream at the service person who was doing their best to handle a situation beyond their control, and then they endlessly tell everyone they know or who will listen that they will never fly that airline or shop that store again.<br>  <br>  I think these people are basically sick and looking for some meaning to their lives or trying to show how important they are.  Pardon my amateur attempt to psychoanalyze these morons.|`|fZjgIE9Baa	Because we have new standards of living nowadays. Things that happened a long time ago are now considered unacceptable, and times have changed<br>  <br>  Why do kids complain when they get a detention? They used to get beaten in school|`|zlPAVkUBaa	It's not a miracle of flight anymore. It was a half century ago. It's just painful transportation now, no matter how short it is. <br>  <br>  I decided to try and count the number of flights I have been on, and it's very close to 100, many of them over 8 hours.<br>  <br>  Drive to the airport to get there 1-2 hours early, depending on where you are. Pay to park for a 15 minute walk to the check in counter.<br>  Stand in line at the counter. Have you bags mauled over.<br>  Stand in line to go through security and remove your belt so you have to hold your pants up while being magnetized.<br>  Wait at the gate for a late arriving aircraft listening to idiots talking on their cell phones. <br>  Board the airplane with all the other herded animals.<br>  Sit down in an uncomfortable seat with no leg room. <br>  Wait to leave. Since your aircraft was late getting in, your assigned takeoff time is gone. "We're number 48 in line to take off." Woohoo!!<br>  I will skip the flight, since it sucks beyond description.<br>  Land and taxi for 3 hours (seems like it) BING! Remove seat belt and try to get off the airplane with "everything you may have brought with you".<br>  Wait for your mangled luggage with the INSPECTED BY TSA note.<br>  Find the rental car counter with the longest line.<br>  Take a bus to the rental car. Get lost leaving the airport. <br>  Go to the hotel and find a frikkin' adult beverage, and reminisce about how marvelous the miracle of flight you just endured was.|`|W7xUNQTPaa	I agree.  I love watching the news that shows all the people stranded in airports who are crying their eyes out because all the flights are cancelled because their is a huricane or heavy fog or something.  Like it is somehow the airlines fault that a 747 crashed on the active runway and they can't take off.  Or the airlines fault that there are 17 other planes trying to take off around the same time as your flight, and for some reason you have to wait.|`|429770cb7e87248aee142afd2cf077ffaa	Because people have fears about flying...although I do think they are REALLY funny sometimes on how they screw things up.<br>  <br>  For example watch the opening scene from "final destiation" they show all hell letting lose on a plane as the plane lurches and seems to be out of control as well as other stuff including seats/people getting sucked out.<br>  <br>  they later show the plane just exploding when it is barely off the ground, rather than going through all the drama of the first scene.<br>  <br>  I found a vid of it on youtube<br>  (dubbed in spanish)|`|dWLgwb3baa	When people pay for something, they expect a certain standard.  When that standard is not met, they complain.  You can go to the fanciest restaurant in the world, but if the food takes 4 hours when you were told it would take 20 minutes, you'd complain no matter how good the food happens to be.|`|o5KbZk1saa	trust me we hate to be late as much as the passengers, but the bottom line is would you rather be late or not arrive at all?<br>  <br>  While the miracle of flight has evolved greatly over the last few decades we have yet to find a way to control the weather..LOL<br>  <br>  regards<br>  <br>  russ|`|FuvCgaEMaa	Haha I totally agree. Listening to people complain about the cost of tickets is funny too. I mean, if you told someone 300 years ago that they could travel from Britain to the New World in just 6 hours by flying over the ocean in a jet airliner, they would be willing to pay an arm and a leg, literally!<br>  <br>  Unfortunately when something's been around for so long, you just "assume" it's always going to be there, always has been there, and that no other way of life ever existed. You try telling elementary school kids that people once did homework by bicycling to the library rather than use the internet, they'd probably just laugh and ask how ancient you were.<br>  <br>  But... everyone always wants something for nothing... I kind of feel that the passenger brought it upon themselves foolishly believing that flight without delays is actually attainable, that bad weather never happens, that all people somehow connected to your ticket is perfectly friendly and all-knowing about your personal travel plans. <br>  <br>  There is one expectation I think we can all expect and it always burns me up when I hear horror stories with this regard: I really don't care how hard work it, I don't care your labour negotiations suck, I don't care that you're dealing with the passenger from hell. When I walk up to the counter I expect eye contact and at the very least a forced smile. You're in the service industry, if you can't be cordial get the h*** out!<br>  <br>  My two cents.<br>  <br>  To Pilsner: Hey, that's just part of the hustle and bustle of air travel. Maybe I'm just an oddball, but I find that hustle and bustle rather exciting!
2Rp9xLRHaa	The devil is in the details on this one. If your pistons and or rings need to be replaced it is due to wear from high mileage or lack of lubrication. In both cases other damage and wear is most likely present. The block will need to be at least honed, and likely bored over size or even re sleeved. Pulling the motor in a Cherokee takes 4 to 6 hours, tear down another 2. The work could be 2 hours or 6 depending on the damage or wear involved, and another 4 to 6 to put everything back and service/run it. Parts could be $300 to $1000 depending again on what needs replaced or reworked. Oil pump, water pump, belts and hoses as well as gaskets and fluids will be in the materials costs with the pistons and rings. Depending on your shops labor rate, $1800 would be an honest "starting" estimate. If the motor has damage/wear other than what is listed, it could go much Higher.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	a base line rebuild, more than you want to pay for the truck. you would be surprised with how much has to be done to get to the pistons. after that much you should just rebuild it. half of the gaskets if not all will need to be replaced any way.
RWjvcCYoaa	Don't worry. You have nothing to fear. There is no way possible that you have anything to do with your ex's car. You would have to be on the contract and the loan in order for you to be liable. And the only way that could happen is if you went to the dealer with him and signed the papers. <br>  <br>  Since you had nothing to do with it, you have no responsibility or liability. It he defaults, the repo is all his. The lender will only go after him. And there will be no account of it on your credit history.|`|rFUgFlyBaa	You said seperated--- are you divorced or just seperated. Reason being is that a divorce releases you from anything (credit) he does and vice-versa. It protects both of you from being held responsible if the other one does something like a 800/month car payment.|`|dU7wcPJbaa	not if you where legally separated if not then you possibly could if you are still concerned then talk to your lawyer|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Legally separated?<br>  How did he trade in your jointly owned car without your OK?<br>  It's likely a lender will go after anybody to collect a debt.

JcZnB3bRaa	The most I've seen yet to date is actually around 200HP. 2 turbos isn't actually the most efficient set up for a Miata. A single turbo would be the wiser choice.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	None. <br>  <br>  Based on two things.<br>  <br>  First, the engine doesn't produce nearly enough exhaust to make twin turbos even remotely efficient. Two cylinders per turbo? Not going to happen.<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you did attempt to get power out of them, it would simply be too much for the engine. Let's say you go for a nice, safe 6-7 psi. Which would be a level that would stop the engine from exploding.<br>  <br>  That means each turbo would only be producing 3psi. It's barely even functioning at that level. So all that money invested, and the turbos are barely moving, and only giving you a total of around 20horsepower, if you're lucky.<br>  <br>  You MIGHT be able to get some decent gains, once you get the RPM up. Which would mean, you would have to wait until around 4,000+ rpm, before the turbos even do anything. Totally pointless.<br>  <br>  Finally, you don't have 133 hp. The engine has 133, before it's installed into the car, without restrictions, etc.<br>  <br>  Actual output is closer to 110.<br>  <br>  Take a step back, and learn a few things about cars, and try again.|`|euXfb9aGaa	About 40 wheel horsepower, before the engine explodes, due to gross negligence.<br>  <br>  The other guy is right. The engine isn't nearly big enough to handle the output required to run dual turbos.<br>  <br>  You could run REALLY small turbos, and get zero gain out of it, but that'd be expensive and stupid.<br>  <br>  But go ahead and give it a try. Take it to a dyno, and see if the car is running after a month.|`|aa9gieAIaa	there really is no reason to use two turbos for a setup like that. you could maybe use two small turbos from motorcycles. id just pick a small turbo with a decent aspect ratio that can give you good high rpm flow. i would strongly consider a constant volume supercharger also. if you blue print the whole engine you could probably get triple or more the power you have now on methnol, but there is no better way of finding the weakest link in the engine than supercharging at high pressures. for unleaded gas and stock pistons you would be able to get very little before detonation condemns you. if you have a set of low comp. ratio pistons made you might get like double the power on pump gas but i would shoot for less maybe a 50% gain, thats about 200hp a good gain. you could probably get 200hp with only 8-9 psi boost and close to stock pistons. it all costs money to do though.|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	The reason for two turbo chargers is to provide power lower in the band. But there is a way that is easier to provide power in the lower end. It is called a super charger. Jackson Racing makes such a unit for the 97 I believe. The general rule is based on the normal atmospheric pressure of 14.5 lbs per square inch. So seven pounds of boost is approximately 1.5 times more air and therefore 1.5 times more horse power. Meaning that a 100 HP engine normal should pump out 150 HP at 7 pounds of boost.<br>  There is one other problem with running twin turbo charges that has been missed. Where are you going to put them? There just is not enough room under the hood. Believe me, if you pick the right unit there will be enough boost from a single unit to provide more boost then the engine can handle.|`|MtAClMbvaa	you MIGHT get enough power going for like 30 seconds to coast your car to the junkyard where it will be eternally f***ed and you will hate yourself for ruining your car by doing a dumba** idiot mod

ZEwAalKPaa	Both the items you have picked out are very very minor items which will be quickly sorted without any detriment to the 'newness' of your vehicle (presumably you never bought a new Rover or Jaguar model) and you have absolutely no chance of a replacement car, none what so ever. I can understand you wanting these 2 tiny assembly errors rectified but to say you are 'gutted'  is going way over the top. These really are VERY minor matters that are easily rectified.<br>  <br>  Both matters should have been picked up by the dealers on their pre delivery inspection and rectified before delivery.|`|1NWjta2jaa	Looks like you have a problem, which will be fixed under warranty. Do you want them to give you a new car EVERY time you have a problem? This is what warranty is for - to fix problems. If a problem can NOT be fixed, then you can start talking about replacement.|`|bqLvWpcZaa	Take it back to the dealer and have them fix it under warranty.  The dealer should not tell you to take it to the body shop though.  Drop off the vehicle with the Benz service dept. and have them look after the warranty repair and to send the car to the body shop if needed.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately even brand new cars have problems.  A lot of times those problems are caught and corrected before the car leaves the factory or even at the dealer level before the car is delivered to the customer but mistakes happen and not all problems are caught.  That's what warranties are for.  Ask the dealer to provide you with a loaner car while your vehicle is being serviced.|`|frn6Fcjuaa	u shud hav inspected befor u spent ur bludy mony on it|`|TCINOEX1aa	Hi There,<br>  <br>  First of all, I am so sorry to hear about troubles with Mercedes-Benz. For the record, not all dealers will put you through this sort of grief.<br>  <br>  I can honestly say that threatening to buy a BMW, go to MB corporate etc might get you what you want, but people working in dealerships are people too and human nature response to that would be to put them off side.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can offer is to go to the sales manager and give him details of your situation. Give them the dates and times and the conversations held and let them know that you are disappointed that your salesman is now requiring more money.<br>  <br>  Go in prepared, though. Check your OTP (Offer To Purchase) and check Vin#, Stock# and the costings of the vehicle including what you were supposed to pay and what those costs included. If the vehicle (with the extras) has the same details as the vehicle on your OTP and there is no mention of the extras, then you are 100% covered. This basically means that any extras that aren't listed but the vehicle has, are at no cost to you. <br>  <br>  If the vehicle listed on the OTP is a different vehicle, then ideally you could tell them that you will only accept that vehicle and if they cannot provide that vehicle, then your contract is NULL & VOID.<br>  <br>  If you do choose to go to MB Corporate I would advise not threatening it first. Just do it and wait for the dealership to contact you... Generally, when complaining to MB Corp, they will contact the dealership and force the dealership to deal with the complaint appropriately. <br>  <br>  Good Luck - I hope you get everything sorted with the dealership :)

AA10349521	i own a 94 540i. i had the same problem, and it was the fuel pump, but while down there, check the filters (mine has 2). also (as others have noted as well), check your relays. in time, getting hot and cold (not necessarily weather) but normal operation, the solder that actually holds the relay together, starts to become brittle and will cause the relay to lose connection... pretty easy fix. id go to bmaparts.com, and get what  you need there. they are reasonable and knowledgeable. also try bimmerforums.com, an online bmw forum for everything BMW.|`|UycnSRXbaa	Why do you think it might be the fuel pump fuse?? how did you come to that conclusions.<br>  OK, to prove your theory, get under the car, passenger side, rear wheel, you will see a ally cover, take that off and you will see another shiny cylinder, this is the fuel filter, unplug one of the tubes and get someone to crank the engine, if the fuse has gone or the pump is dead, nothing will happen, if it is working, you might get fuel squirted in the eye, so be careful.<br>  <br>  I think it might be the cars immobilizer, the older BMWs use the T2 and T3 alarms which renowned for begin complete crap and one of the ways in which they fail is by NOT disengaging the immobilizer, this then causes the engine to turn, but not fire.  <br>  I also know that on some BMW Models, the immobilizer is wired in to the fuel pump relay.<br>   Hope this helps, but without seeing the car, it's gonna be alittle difficult to help you any more.|`|f60f9dd363f9ce088c134896470f9277aa	let it sit just in case it was flooded and try again later.

I don't think I can name a car out there that was originally released as the next year's model unless it came out in around January or February.  It's probably a psychological thing too, since consumers think that they will be getting the newest car and be able to feel "cool" for getting a car that's the next model year before that year even hits.  Could also give you a higher resale value since the car is technically a little older than what the year would suggest.

Take that and refer through it, it should guide you on what you need to study. <br>  <br>  Also get some of the sticky tabs and start tabbing out your FAR manual, not only does this let your examiner know you have spent time in the Regs, but it helps you access Regs Quickly. You'll find it easier to remember them the more you are around aviation.<br>  <br>  Hope i have hellped you!|`|dWLgwb3baa	It really depends on what you are studying.  I'm guessing you are working on a private pilot certificate.  Parts 61 and 91 are the big ones for you.

Just skip over anything that pertains to an instrument rating.<br>  <br>  The AIM is harder to separate, but it is easy to read.  Just start looking through it, and again, pass over anything that has to do with IFR clearances and procedures.|`|pIQ5LPW4aa	I'm not saying don't read it, but its pretty long. It might be longer than the bible. Anyways I agree with the other statement to use a good study guide. The study guides will highlight the most important information. If you wait to sit for your exam after you read it, you will be waiting forever. Take practice exams to determine what you already know, read the chapters that you failed on the practice exam in the AIM.

TJMpKqFNaa	If both engines are rated at 160hp, then yes they make the same amount of peak horsepower.  The powerbands of the two engines are totally different though.<br>  <br>  The Honda's high revving I-4 makes its 160hp at around 7800rpm and has only about 110 lb-ft of peak torque.  The high RPM power peak means you'll have to rev the Honda engine a lot to get to the 160 peak hp it makes.  Below the power peak, the engine doesn't have tons of power because torque is directly related to hp by RPM and the engine doesn't make much torque due to it's small size (compared to the Nissan's larger V6 anyway).<br>  <br>  The Nissan's V6 also makes 160hp, but at a much lower RPM than the Honda's I-4.  The V6 also makes 180 lb-ft of torque, also available at lower RPM.  This means that the Nissan's V6 will make more power at lower RPM than the Honda I-4 but both engines at their power peak produce the same amount of horsepower - the Nissan's power peak just comes at a much lower RPM than the Honda's.<br>  <br>  My advice is to buy the Del Sol if you enjoy revving the motor a lot.  They're fun cars if you like that sort of thing, but you have to really rev them for them to feel fast.  Buy the 300ZX if you like a more steady push off the line and don't plan on a doing a ton of redline shifts for the car to feel somewhat quick.|`|Xzdyz8Kiaa	You looked up hard data on something and you're visiting Yahoo!

This in no way helps the doctor to find your problem. If you say it is a sharp pain in the lower back, now he has something to start with and will order the appropriate tests to help diagnosis your problem. The same is true with your car. When you tell the technician about your problem, it gives him a course of action to resolve your problem. This may involve several tests, all of which take time and it is like looking for a ghost. Especially if this is an intermittent problem that comes and goes. Typical information could be , it only does it when its cold or I hear the noise at 58 mph on a smooth road when it rains. The more details you give the better the chances are of a quick repair. I usually tell my customers that it will take what it takes to resolve the problem and I will be as fair as I can be.

JKQhSGEEaa	the manual will give you better mpg and will have a bit more of low end torque than the same truck with a auto. if you are a new driver i wouldnt get a manual just yet. pretty much any truck with a v8 will do. you got chevys 5.3 6.0 and 8.1(i think thats what they are around) the 8.1's were offered in some trucks mostly 2500HD's you will average about 10mpg. ford has the 4.6 and 5.4 v8s gas mpg is around the same little bit of difference on them but not much. the 4.6 i found was a little bit under powered for towing a jeep cj5 on a 20 foot trailer but it still did good the 5.4 is great for towing and has no problems. dodge has 4.7 5.7hemi earlier trucks had the 5.2 and 5.9s which the 5.2 and 5.9s were ok on gas about 15mpg average.4.7 is a little better but in a full size truck its under powered(like the ram 1500) 5.7 hemi is great for towing your looking at about 13-15mpg average. im not a chevy guy so i could can only tell you that my bosses 06 sliverado 4dr with the 6.0 in it gets pretty good mpg and tows well. but he has started to have problem with the 4x4,heater,and steering. now for diesel dodge had the 5.9 l6 diesel which is what i got in my truck and i tow a 36foot camper and it has no problems at all. the new one is 6.7 and is great and would like to have one to go with my 5.9. ford has the 6.0(junk imo) and 7.3's which are great compared to the 6.0's. chevy has the 6.6 but since i dont follow them i dont really no anything else about them. to sum everything up i recomend the ford or the dodge v8's if you got any other questions let me know would be more than happy to answer them.

zruhNGKbaa	Another example of the law of unintended consequences.<br>  <br>  TPMS is a wonderful Idea but the design failed to anticipate the common practice of mounting winter tires on used or aftermarket rims ... so instead of recognizing that the installed rims do not have the TPMS transponders installed the system simply screams FLAT TIRE all the time... If there is no procedure to deactivate the system described in the owners manual then I can well imagine what kind of expensive nightmare they will be for owners when they age and the transponders start to fail.  <br>  <br>  Check your owners manual and if no luck there visit your dealership and at the very least lodge a complaint so they know that it is a problem.|`|AA11314600	I think our avatars might be brothers|`|bLjGM9yNaa	The TPMS will continue to warn the driver of low tire<br>  pressure as long as the condition exists, and will not turn<br>  off until the tire pressure is at or above the recommended<br>  cold placard pressure. Once the low tire pressure warning<br>  (Tire Pressure Monitoring Telltale Light) illuminates, you<br>  must increase the tire pressure to the recommended cold<br>  placard pressure in order for the Tire PressureMonitoring<br>  Telltale Light to turn off. The system will automatically<br>  update and the Tire Pressure Monitoring Telltale Light<br>  will turn off once the system receives the updated tire<br>  pressures. The vehicle may need to be driven for up to<br>  20 minutes above 15 mph (25 km/h) in order for the<br>  TPMS to receive this information.<br>  ? For example, your vehicle may have a recommended<br>  cold (parked for more than three hours) placard pressure<br>  of 30 psi (207 kPa). If the ambient temperature is 68°F<br>  (20°C) and the measured tire pressure is 27 psi (186 kPa),<br>  a temperature drop to 20°F (-7°C) will decrease the tire<br>  pressure to approximately 26 psi (179 kPa). This tire<br>  pressure is sufficiently low enough to turn ON the Tire<br>  Pressure Monitoring Telltale Light. Driving the vehicle<br>  may cause the tire pressure to rise to approximately 27 psi<br>  (186 kPa), but the Tire Pressure Monitoring Telltale Light<br>  will still be ON. In this situation, the Tire Pressure<br>  Monitoring Telltale Light will turn OFF only after the tires<br>  are inflated to the vehicle’s recommended cold placard<br>  pressure value.<br>  STARTING AND OPERATING   pg 299  of the 2009 owners manual<br>  <br>  This was right out of the 2009 Owners manual...

SGYmfWWdaa	I had a 98 mustang, and the front left bearing went out.  It made the noise you described, sort of a metal grinding/scratching noise when i turned the car.  If you can, jack up the front end of your car and lock the steering wheel.  The front tires should rotate freely, and there should be no wobble.  When my bearing went bad, it felt like i could turn the tire left and right (and even up and down) a little with my hands, even though the steering wheel remained stationary.  Note that this test only works if the bearing is messed up badly.  It is still possible to have a bad bearing and not be able to tell using this test.<br>  <br>  you should have the car looked at by a professional, as soon as possible.  if it is a bearing, it can suddenly seize up as you are driving down the road.  as a general rule, that doesnt end well for anybody inside the car.|`|lW2W1ApBaa	Have the brakes checked out, also make sure nothing is rubbing the tire,|`|ntZkMdphaa	Might have bad brake pads, and they are worn to the rivets.

TdrgZwnoaa	I drive a School Bus with engine braking. This vehicle is well normally well muffled but when the retarder system kicks in the noise is quite loud and just a bit rude. For that reason we do not use it in residential areas.<br>   I do like the suggestion about the lack of brake lights though. These systems work very well and unless you are coming to a FULL STOP the brakes are not really required and these buses do haul down quite quickly with the retarder system switched on. I never really thought of that before. Also, the retarder system is tied into the shifter mapping of our automatic tranny equipped buses and these things downshift quite aggressively. <br>   But to answer the question - the bylaws are really for noise reduction.|`|fMS1kDA2aa	because it slows the car without the brake lights going on, so people behind you might not know you're braking. just a safety hazard|`|1tilPTPVaa	Its mostly because of the noise caused by large trucks . . . .|`|YtKlVO4Caa	It is dangerous for other drivers because they can't tell when you are slowing down, because of the lack of brake lights.

PHdsOPwIaa	In the state of California new buses are required to have seat belts now.<br>  I own a 2009 Thomas HDX schoolbus with 3-point seatbelts. Pain in the butt, cos the kids don't wear them. EXCEPT the little guys...<br>  Buses are a different vehicle than cars. You get rear ended, you don't feel it, hec, the bus barely moves. <br>  If your state doesn't require them yet, give them time....they'll catch up. They want to make sure approve the right system. Lap belts were shown to be more dangerous with internal injuries on the test dummies. <br>  The 3 spoint system seems to be the good one. And it keeps the monsters in their seat. :P<br>  <br>  So now you have compartmentalization, 3 point belts, brighter lights (LEDS), a roof that can hold about 5-6x the bus's weight...or I think it's 10x the weight of the bus now.....there's so many safety features on a school bus today.<br>  <br>  personally, i see seatbelts good and bad. My bus holds 78 small kids, I can't see myself getting all 78 out if there's a fire, and that's WITH a seatbelt cutter. <br>  On the other hand, the belts keep them seated.<br>  <br>  California State Law required all passengers to use the belts if the bus is equipped.<br>  <br>  RE:<br>  Unruly students could also use the heavy buckles as makeshift weapons, creating even more of a safety hazard. <br>  <br>  This does no happen on my bus or any other bus equipped with retracting belts.

It is also feared that some students would receive internal injuries from seat belts through a process called submarining, the tendency for a body to slide downwards during impact.<br>  <br>  Seat belts on school buses may also hamper rescue or evacuation efforts, as adults or older students may have to spend precious minutes unbuckling young or disoriented passengers. <br>  <br>  Unruly students could also use the heavy buckles as makeshift weapons, creating even more of a safety hazard. <br>  <br>  There is also the argument that seat belts would only protect passengers of school buses during unusual events such as roll-overs or flips, not other possible accidents such as fires or submersion.<br>  <br>  Considering the expense of retrofitting current school buses or replacing entire fleets with approved seat belt systems, the benefits of seat belt use do not currently outweigh the liabilities.<br>  <br>  One problem many school systems face with the prospect of mandatory seat belt use on school buses is compliance. <br>  <br>  The bus driver already has a significant amount of responsibility, so schools would have to hire additional monitors to ride on all the school buses. In light of sexual misconduct concerns, both male and female monitors would have to be hired in order to avoid any allegations of impropriety. <br>  <br>  Besides the added expense of hiring qualified monitors, there would also be a question of liability if even one student removed his or her seat belt and became injured as a result.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	This gets asked on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  The safety board of transportation did extensive studies on this.<br>  <br>  It is SAFER not to have seat belts.<br>  <br>  Think about it. In the event of an accident, do you really want some rescue worker trying to undo the seatbelts of 30+ kids?<br>  <br>  The last dozen would be dead, before they got to them.<br>  <br>  Nevermind that school buses are so large, that they absorb a tremendous amount of kinetic energy...meaning that the kids inside would barely be moved around at all.<br>  <br>  And yet...no one seems to mind that on adult buses, you have people that STAND. Which is really dumb.|`|CDyHU3Qaaa	because the bus would be late for school everyday , trying to get the kids to sit down and fasten their seat belts|`|jWHxcyaUaa	They do. At least in some places. In 2005 5 girls were killed when a schoolbus crashed in Co. Meath, Ireland.<br>  <br>  This lead to a law being passed to make seatbelts compulsory in all schoolbusses.<br>  <br>  If your schoolbus doesn't have seatbelts you should be asking for them.<br>  <br>  And as for people being safe on a bus anyway, thats just not true!|`|f915b96cf0e8a3afb012b1b833b05df8aa	click  search for question. you may be about the 2 millionth person who has asked this question<|`|TdrgZwnoaa	AGAIN ?! ? ! ?

I have been wearing seat belts (without exception) since they were offered on cars.<br>  <br>  However, on the practical side, I have to comply with the 'no seat belt' policy for the following reasons.<br>  <br>  1 - If I am incapacitated in an accident who is going to unbelt 48 students; and some buses can carry even more students than that!<br>  <br>  2 - what driver can stop the bus every 5 minutes and do a complete seat belt check to see if all belts are done up and, indeed, positioned properly. Remember; some buses have a 70 student capacity.<br>  <br>  3 - If there is a fire onboard there will be insufficient time to get all the students out of their belts and off the bus.<br>  <br>  4 - school bus seats are made of deformable materials and absorb impact very well.<br>  <br>  5 - I wear a seat belt primarily to enable me to remain in control of the bus in emergency avoidance maneuvers plus the fact that I have no barriers to prevent me from being thrown through a picture window sized windshield. My students are surrounded by crash padding.<br>  <br>  Although my particular bus has seat belt mounting points built in it is highly unlikely that we will see seat belts installed for a very long time. If the taxpayers want to hire two bus monitors to ride every school bus in North America full time I would welcome it. Until then the status quo will have to suffice.<br>  <br>  One of our buses was t-boned by a transport a few years ago and put onto it's side. Except for a few bumps and bruises the kids were fine. The bus driver (the only one with a seat belt) was in hospital for 2 months.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Because in the event of a car accident, nothing will happen to a bus since it's so huge.
bLjGM9yNaa	Check out Tirerack.com<br>      It seems the original tire was a 225/45r17<br>                 optional  235/45r17<br>  <br>      there's an 800 number you can call to ask their opinion..<br>  <br>    You should be ok.... it's a bit smaller in circumference but it should do.   Check to be sure.<br>  <br>        Good Luck to you.
5BiBamrxaa	A ticket will normally cost ￡60 and 3 points on the license. <br>  Could be a lot more if you exceed the limit by a lot.<br>  <br>  Speeding is an absolute offence so you could get done for going 1mph over the limit. <br>  In practice there is normally some leeway and guidelines are 10% = 2mph.<br>  So for 70mph limit you would definitely get done for anything over 79 but may get away with less.<br>  <br>  f|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	You really shouldn't need to ask this question.<br>  <br>  Think about it.<br>  <br>  It is a limit. Not a suggestion.<br>  <br>  70mph is the maximum allowed speed. At 71mph, you can get a ticket.<br>  <br>  If I tell you to go into my wallet, and take 5$, and you take $8, that's stealing, right?|`|SI02JOQ4aa	Many police forces use the guideline of 10%+3mph, so 35 in a 30 would not qualify, and nor would 80 in a 70 limit.<br>  <br>  This is because of a margin of error for calibration of equipment.|`|wyAtVqbOaa	The cost of speeding tickets depends on where, when and how much you were doing the speeding. <br>  <br>  As for how much going over the speed limit, it does again depend on where.  Tolerance is higher on the motorway but not so much on streets but the general rule is 10% above the limit, so for example in a 30 mile limit you could get away with doing 33 BUT this rule is not always allowed.  <br>  <br>  This general 10% rule is that the speedometer cannot be guaranteed to be accurate in the speed that you are doing.  Normally speedometers are set to show the speed to be higher than what you are really doing but not always.  For example, our previous car was always 10% slower then the speed we were doing (it would say that we were doing 77 but we were doing 70) but our current car is only 5% out.  <br>  <br>  Ihaveasexyhusband|`|APtZhqAGaa	Speed limits in the UK are like the lottery but loaded in the favour of the police. They very from county to county - may police forces set targets for their men and use the fines to boost income for the local community.<br>  <br>  On the motorway you can find yourself keeping up with other cars at 80    - 85 mph but if you don't know the area be careful, those who do will slam on their brakes coming up to a camera and if you are not prepared you will hit them in the rear.<br>  <br>  Driving in the UK is the most frustrating place I know in Europe!|`|2f342328e53df826906951ac96feda13aa	unfortunately you cant get away with speeding in the uk if you get caught... unless you get a good lawyer.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Laws are strict in the UK, speeding over 3-7mph over the limit for a period of 10-30 seconds can end you up with a ticket. You cannot exceed speed limits at all or you will be ticketed.<br>  <br>  Upon, first offence, the ticket will probably be around ￡50.<br>  <br>  If a constant offender, you will be asked to pay considerably more and possibly even be asked to take part in special help groups for speeders|`|SXrNVQbFaa	Breaking the limit is breaking the limit..<br>  HOWEVER - there is a 10% leeway on speed cameras - i.e if the limit is 70, you can go to 77 without being fined. 30 - 33 etc. And if the police see you doing 33 in a 30, it is unlikely they will pull you over unles you are driving dangerously/other reasons.|`|jz9cqjZpaa	you can get away with being 10% over the speed limit, you would get 3 points and a ￡60 fine
ki5hZbcTaa	I would get a car seat that rear faces to 35 pounds instead of turning him before 1 year. It's against the law because they have to meet both requirements. If you are short on cash, you can get the Cosco Scenera for 43 dollars at walmart which has the limit to 35 pounds.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	He has to be both one year and 20 pounds to face the front. Doesn't matter if he reaches one before the other, he has to be both. <br>  Keep his backwards for another 3 months. It's much safer for him like that.|`|jMqaBDdWaa	I know the expense is a bother, but get a seat that will go up to 35 or 40 lbs rear facing, and keep him rear- facing as long as you can - he'll be safer that way.<br>  <br>  And don't worry - their growth rate slows after they get to be a year old.
OBTYM9ihaa	Well for one its an 87. You can hotwire those things, and just smash the windows out, or since the tubbing around the window are usually lose you can jimmy a rod under them to get at the lock. <br>  <br>  If you call the cops give them a GOOD detail of if, and license plate number they can put a P.B out for it.|`|54wgMlSFaa	UUUUUUUUUUUMMMMMMM if youre driving an 87 youre not a stang fanatic.and if you were you would have premium  insurance.and you have a high profile because youre black.not because of a lame *** 87  stang.and that year all you needed was a coat hanger and a screwdriver.surely you knew that.|`|UPMRdb4maa	im not quite sure what your asking here

33d13c8fa116273403e0f7b580bfabe3aa	Basic controls like turn signals, horn, wipers, etc... <br>  <br>  Yes you're supposed to look over your shoulder, one tip my teacher had told me prior to the test is to wear a baseball cap. Because when you turn your head to look they notice it more because the bill of the hat is moving.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|aRUEXTTtaa	they dont ask you much <br>  they just tell you where everything is<br>  they dont expect you to know anything thats why their there<br>  <br>  and no you dont have to look over your shoulder when your turning<br>  why would you?<br>  just check no one is coming or turning|`|DC4Civrvaa	You need to know how to work the defroster, wipers, signals, brake and emergency brake.  Always look when turning, no matter what.  It is 100% better to overdo it than to under-do it. Trust me on this one!  When I took mine the guy wrote me down for not turning my head when changing lanes, but I didn't need to turn my whole head to see!  I have very good peripheral vision. lol  whatever, at least I passed.  Good luck!|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	They will ask you to show them all the controls before you even leave the lot. They want to make sure they all work.<br>  2. When you turn you do not look over your shoulder.<br>  You look ahead and at the lane you are getting ready to turn on to.<br>  Good Luck|`|RiQA4Epraa	just the basic controls, turn signals, brakes, etc..<br>  if you dont know how to turn those on, you shouldnt be driving<br>  <br>  and yes you do<br>  <br>  you signal, look over should, if clear, change lanes|`|RMGzjECmaa	they are gonna tell they same thing they said in the 30 hour class thing.|`|4HdgVprJaa	lol read the book. no literally, if the booklet says to do it...do it. Everything for moving your mirror (ever if they are perfect already) just to show you did it, to adjusting your seat, and looking over your shoulder. Plus don't be too nice to the driver, I got a point taken off for "distraction" for asking him "Hi, how are you" lol no joking!|`|AHoCSWofaa	they won't be taking points off for you being too cautious. if you do happen to do that during the test, out of habit, it's no worries mate. if they ask you to demonstrate controls, they will be common sense (like the wipers, signals, cruise control, etc). if you've done your studying and everything you'll be just fine. good luck!|`|8EPgeU0raa	noo, i don't think you would have to look over your shoulder if you're turning, just make sure to check the surroundings. but make sure you do look over your shoulder when you are changing lanes.|`|OBTYM9ihaa	Well when i took mine. I always shoulder check when i turn ( when it is needed) And all the stuff you would normally do as a driver. They wont take marks off for doing that. They may correct you, but they shouldnt take marks off.|`|Et00egktaa	if you are turning right you have to shoulder check for cyclists but not for turning left, also you should very subtly scan intersections as you drive through them|`|hMF3kg3Baa	you have to look at the in the mirror and use the blinkers|`|ayBzdRK7aa	it depends on the state. and the instructor. ask around your school|`|Ou3sFkKeaa	always look over ur shoulder and mirrors and NEVER slow down when u change lanes|`|ypOMzh7paa	when just turning, you don't have to look over your shoulder. if your changing lanes, you have to because u have to check your blind spot

658c97c2e40e2eb3b804b250ef53cb21aa	You should ride a motorbike as if you are driving a car.<br>  <br>  Hence you would fail if you overtake in the situation you mentioned.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Turn you blinker on look at your mirrors and turn around and if all is clear then pass.....|`|QfIxlKAjaa	No, you are perfectly within your rights to overtake a DISABLED vehicle which is blocking traffic. However, do so by passing it on the left. do not pass a vehicle on the right unless there is an open lane in this circumstance.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	keep on your line if you saw a yellow line in the middle of the road it means no overtaking

Several years ago a client of mine was an ex-motor cop who incidently was also a lesbian.  She was behind a desk after dumping her bike (Kawasaki Police Special) chasing down a bad guy.

hEZaWs9yaa	9-5 is front wheel drive only. All have traction control std. Front wheel drive gives 2mpg better economy because you don't have the weight and noise concerns of the transfer case and driveshaft whirling under you.

It's unstoppable.|`|O5CIDWqfaa	No, no 9-5 have AWD.  <br>  <br>  Don't believe the Kool Aid drinkers who say you don't need it.  Sometimes you don't need it and sometimes you do.<br>  <br>  The FWD system in a 9-5 is very good.  For many drivers, it's all that you need.  Saves gas, good winter behavior, no need to worry about keeping all the tire treads/treadwear the same (which is much more important in AWD).<br>  <br>  If you have a muddy, long driveway, AWD does help!  It also helps in cities who don't clear the snow and have quite a few hills.<br>  <br>  For me, I need only FWD.  <br>  <br>  (A historical lesson, in 1978 or so, cult leader Jim Jones poisoned 900 followers with poisoned Kool Aid in Guyana.  He held suicide/Kool Aid drills and prohibited people from leaving so that's how he did it)

RbZpdX8Haa	if it's not rounded off, you can double wrench it, by using 2 combination wrench's, ( full size, not shortys) using the box end on the bolt, just hook the box end of the second over the jaw of the other.  It will give you the leverage you need.  the second wrench doesn't even have to be the same size, one size larger works.<br>  <br>    You don't need a ratchet and socket, trust me, 2 wrenches will do it.<br>  <br>  Looking at it, turn it counter-clockwise to loosen,<br>  <br>  remember, righty tighty, lefty losey <br>  <br>  one extreme tool is called a torque multiplier, they come in manual and hydraulic <br>  <br>  I've used my foot and cheater pipes too|`|nOU8WvmDaa	instead of buying a new bigger wrench or ratchet just slide a metal pipe halfway down your old wrench for leverage|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	Make sure you're turning it counterclockwise.

I do have it lifted 4.5 inches though.  Those are the largest tires you can fit on the stock 15x7 rims.  Not 20 inches like the earlier post.  Knows nothing about jeeps.  Hell, the stock rubber for the Grand is 28 inches.  A 6 inch wide tire on a 7 inch wide rim?  What does this guy think you have? A bicycle?<br>  To deal with rubbing at suspension compression, you can just put 2 inch poly spacers on top of your springs for a quick lift that will not change the suspension geometry.  Also you should not experience driveline vibration with 2 inches or less.  As for rubbing at full turn, look at wheel spacers.  They will push your wheels out 1.25 inches each and will prevent rubbing.  I have a set from Spidertraxx on my jeep and have absolutely no issues of rubbing on or off-road.|`|7HDWtqhOaa	31's you will need to lift the truck. Minimum lift would be 2", use lifting spacers and if you 4x4 you will rub a little and for sure if you use MT's over AT's. Also on turning you will rub with 10.5 wide if you use factory setback  rims, 9.50 will work if you use at's and again a little rub if you use mt's.

k9Uxo6lWaa	I would guess that the CHP training class will give you a solid base from which to learn to ride. I recommend any  certified training class you can find. in Oregon it is called "team Oregon" in south gerogis it is taught at the AirForce base and I have no clue about its organization. MSF is another common group. all that said the classes will only give you a very basic set of skills. you will not learn everything in a 2 day class... in fact 2 years from now you will still be learning.  once you have taken the class ride as often as you can with as many people as you can watch learn and practice. learn to admit (atleast to yourself)your mistakes. take in all the horror stories you can there are many valuable lessons in them. and  yes the 250 ninja is a great bike for most beginning riders regardless of sex.|`|fl60KL8oaa	Yes.  They will take you from never having touched a motorcycle to not going to kill yourself immediately.  Starts with sitting on the bike and getting the feel of the clutch by rocking the bike back and forth using the engine, progresses through to doing figure-8's in a box, hard braking, swerving, etc..  About the only thing they don't teach is the proper way to fall.  (take a martial arts class)<br>  <br>  IMO the Baby Ninja is an excellent city bike with freeway and touring capability.  Good bike period.  Just not my style.  The 2007 and earlier are slightly smaller and lighter than the 2008 and up.

a7a7a0bfe671ddedd1999ac93097444caa	Ejection seats typically cause injuries to even trained aircrew who are in FAR better shape than your average commercial passenger.<br>  <br>  I rode a McDonnell Douglas Escapac E-1 "zero-zero" seat back in 1993 and ended up a half-inch shorter as well as being grounded for the rest of my career.<br>  <br>  The other reasons folks here have given are also valid:<br>  <br>  Weight, cost, danger.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Ever ridden an ejection seat?<br>  They often injure a trained, prepared, strong,<br>   healthy aircrewman.<br>  The average passenger would be toast.|`|aeafadcfdc8ef601112d10110bc000cbaa	Fighter jets typically have only one person on board (occasionally two--some larger military planes can have 4 ejection seats, but that is the limit).<br>  The point is that military planes mission is not to carry people around, so they do not have to deal with 100 or 200 people. Accordingly, having a clear path to ejection through the canopy is something that can be done, and the weight of the ejection seat and mechanism is something that can be fitted in the design, even if it makes the seat twice as heavy as a non-ejectable one.<br>  Military airplane are expected to go into tight spots. They could get fired at, can be scrambled at the last second, and so on; all things that commercial airplane don't do. And military crew are trained on the usage of the ejection seat. And they wear protective gear, suits and helmet.<br>  <br>  Now, imagine a commercial airliner in trouble. Where are airliners when they get in trouble? Just after take-off or just before landing. In most cases, there is not even the time for crew to issue an "eject" command.<br>  Take a recent example, the Airbus that landed in the Hudson. Imagine people ejecting as the plane came down, landing everywhere in the freezing water, instead of staying together with the airframe and the very competent, well trained crew.<br>  Imagine people ejecting out of sequence, requiring some kind of opening above (oppps! That is where the overhead baggage compartment is located? How does one deal with this? What about the people on the lower deck of the 747, where do they eject to?) blasting the other passengers that are not out yet with their seat's ejection rocket?<br>  Not very nice: more people would be hurt by the blast effect than would safely be ejected, not to say anything about the landing, which would be wherever the plane happens to be at the time, even over (again) freezing water.<br>  So, no one would be saved, a lot more could be hurt.<br>  <br>  Now, let's push a little further: where do you put the ejection command?<br>  Only the pilot has it? Or each passenger has his own? And if the later, what would happen if your neigbour on the next seat decides to pull the handle, "just to see what happens"? What if someone trips on it accidentally? Unlike military fighter pilots who get in from the top and have to remain seated for the whole (usually short) flight, most passenger will get up and move around during flights that last 6 to 10 hours or more (I am sure not many can last 10 hours without visiting the washroom at least once). So you get up, and lo, you accidentally hit the handle. Then what happens?<br>  <br>  Also, ejection seats have restrictions. Nearly 30 years ago, my best friend applied to be in the air force. He went through all the selection process, and they measured him and at 6 ft 4 in, his proportions had it that, in case of ejection, he would have left part of his legs behind as his knees were a bit too long. So, he became an aerospace engineer instead. At the other end of the scale, how would an ejection seat deal with an infant or small children?<br>  How many people are too tall, or too fat or too little for ejection seat?<br>  <br>  Conclusion: ejection seat would weight a lot, cost a lot, cause a lot of trouble and ultimately would not save a single life, but could kill a lot of people. So, we don't put them in airliners.|`|zlPAVkUBaa	A passenger aircraft do not have eject seat for each passenger because of size, weight, and rocket motors, that is why commercial airplane do not have. <br>  <br>  This would also require all passengers to have frequent fryer numbers.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	or give them personal parachutes<br>  or make the out of black boxes<br>  <br>  What other moronic idea could we through out there<br>  <br>  Nets over engines?  <br>  <br>  What about big roads so they can just drive on the ground?  <br>  <br>  Let's drain all the lakes for water landings!|`|c425bd77add075a97bdceeb9591a73bbaa	First we have to fit a parachute to the plane and each passenger, and fit them with kamikaze helmets made of black box material.<br>  <br>  *drink*|`|f312398220fe22f8bbeaa1457a68057faa	1) Can you imagine 300 people launching from an aircraft at one time?<br>  2) How many would be prepared for the wind blast?

How much will she contribute if so?  As I said, only you can figure it out.  Good luck.|`|uqtD12Lnaa	If your lender is willing a loan modification is the best option.  If you refinance you will have more costs, points, brokers fees etc.  Also, in a refinance the new lender will require  equity and with the decreasing house prices you might not have enough equity to qualify for a refinance loan.<br>  <br>  See if you can get an idea of the current value of your home from a realtor, don't waste money on an appraisal at this early stage.  Then call a loan broker and ask him what the typical equity requirement is for a refinance loan.  <br>  <br>  Do not get suckered into the line "we can get you a loan, so stop making your payments while the loan is approved, it will make accounting easier."  Very big mistake that a lot of people make and end up losing their home in foreclosure.  If you want to have a loan broker try to get you a loan that is fine, but keep making your regular payments regardless of what the broker says.<br>  <br>  While the broker is working on a loan, talk to your lender and see what the loan modification opportunities are.  Once you have details from both the loan broker and the lender then you can make a knowledgeable decision on what is best for you based on your income situation at that time.
FuvCgaEMaa	That's a nasty bit of business.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drivers.com/article/149/" rel="nofollow">http://www.drivers.com/article/149/</a><br>  <br>  This article is about a man in Canada who was driving the speed limit in the left hand lane. He was charged with obstructing traffic and mischief (the latter a criminal offense).<br>  <br>  You're talking about a double standard. Legally you have to abide by the speed limit, but it is illegal to obstruct traffic. If you don't break the law by speeding, you are breaking the law by holding others up driving the limit in the left lane. It's weird isn't it? If a police car were watching, he would probably pull you over instead of the guy who sped past you (well he'd go for the speeder at 70+ but if you were passed at like 60 then the officer would get you instead for obstructing). <br>  <br>  The left lane is defined by most states as a "passing lane". So unless you're doing some passing, try to avoid that lane.<br>  <br>  And personally, I'll change lane. If the guy is tailgating real bad, and there's no safe place to merge, I'll speed up a little bit to get the guy off my bumper but merge as soon as I safely can.|`|hvNuBjIEaa	At that speed you better stay in the right lane.  55mph is technically for all lanes but the left lane is "reserved" for those who may want to speed up a bit - those who want to pass up the law-abiding-55mph- drivers.|`|HwujORd2aa	You did the right thing and the safe thing.

wBrPA1Dlaa	First off, many general mechanics hate working on VWs.  They are used to making money the easy way and/or don't have the proper equipment.  There is a chance your guy is trying to get rid of you because he has been burned on VWs in the past.  <br>  <br>  If he can't figure out if the codes have been erased or he is unable to communicate with the engine module all together,  it sounds like he doesn't have the proper equipment.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes an aftermarket radio that has been incorrectly installed will jam up communications between the car and scanner(this is also a possibility)<br>  <br>  The "computer" being bad is unlikely(but not impossible)<br>  <br>  If there is not an MIL (check engine light) present my best guess is you need a new throttle body.  When these go bad the car will cut out on acceleration, buck or just plain drive like doo doo.  It can be a sporadic occurrence as well.  <br>  <br>  Don't run out and buy one just yet.  What you need is professional diagnosis.  If you are unhappy with your dealership you should try to find a smaller shop that specializes in VWs or Euros in general.|`|dw3T0bgCaa	When you say 'the car's computer' do you mean the engine onboard control device?

Gh7vs777aa	my answer is try to check it out first on auto repair shop...|`|HFrsH9MRaa	You must find the REASON for the cat going bad. Usually, it is from a dirty idle air control valve or clogged up oil trap. The oil trap is common to Volvo pretty much exclusively. It will alter the fuel mixture if it is full or gunky oil. If you run a can of Gum-out through your intake system, you will usually clean the carbon out of it and restore it to good condition. Also, use only "top tier" fuels, not discounted fuel. After market converters that are not a Volvo part are a WASTE of money!!! Trust me. Also, replace your O2 sensor and look for exhaust manifold leaks.

If it has a sunroof, add aproximately $900 and with a V6 add aprox. $2000.  At that time, Toyota was not doing as many incentives on any of their vehicles and I think the greatest incentive I recall for the model was near the end of the model year and amounted to about $500.

A third driver swerved to avoid the first two cars and apparently hit the woman a second time.<br>  <br>  A witness, who drove by the incident, said the body of the woman was lying across the HOV lane near the Priest Drive exit. Before police arrived on the scene, drivers were detouring around the body.<br>  <br>  Traffic was being rerouted onto northbound Loop 101, where traffic is also backed up because of another accident at Broadway.

f5ibT3WNaa	One thing you could do is wrap the tire with a ratchet strap and tighten it up, this will make the tire expand and plug the gap so you can start putting air in it. Be sure that when the air starts pumping you unlock the strap. Or you can to the starting fluid method but thats dangerous, just look on youtube.|`|7Wi32KRgaa	the guy who said to use a ratchet strap is right on. take the strap and wrap it around the outside diameter of the tire. When you tighten it up the beads will seat on the rim. Then put the air in to the required pressure.|`|2z0vpYqtaa	I would just take it off and go to a tire shop... there are methods of getting it back on, but depending on the condition of the tire, you may have to just get a new one...|`|2yrEjfmLaa	take it off and take it to a tire shop.

v8TWvtQgaa	1st racer 123  where in the hell do you get X power level means you have to run X octane. <br>  <br>  Your nuts dude. <br>  <br>  I have a 505 HP 355 that runs on pump 92 octane <br>  <br>  Its all aboput compression, cam size, quench height, timing and jetting. That engine was iron headed and at 10.18:1 <br>  <br>  I just built another 355 thats gonna be right at 600 HP,  10.34:1 compression  will run all day long, every day on 92/93 octane <br>  <br>  <br>  Now to answer the question.  Stick with the dual plane RPM intake and 600 cfm eddy carb. <br>  <br>  That intake is VERY good. The vic jr only beats it out on avg by 6-10 HP at 6500 rpm and higher, but gives up as much as 15 ft lbs of torque at 4500 rpm and lower <br>  <br>  If it tells you anything. The 2 above engines I mentioned, I have an RPM intake on them. Shift point is 6400 rpm on the 505 HP engine, and I est shift point to be about 6800 rpm on the 600 HP one.  I ran 11.40's @ 118 1/4 mile in a 3250 lbs camaro plus my 270 lbs butt driving with the 505 HP one and the RPM intake|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Kind of depends on how you've built up the rest of the motor.  Are you looking for more low RPM power or more high RPM power?  The dual plane intake will give you better low end power while the Victor Jr. should be better on the higher end.<br>  <br>  If it's going to be mainly a streetable daily driver I'd probably use the performer intake.  If you plan on making passes at the drag strip once in a while etc., I'd go with the victor jr. and the bigger carb|`|1c264470699c75f9ef21a75b4682539eaa	The 325 hp level instantly demands a 98 octane fuel as the very minimum you can use.Are you ready to guarantee that nothing less will be introduced? If not- you should aim for a more 87 octane friendly-250hp/290tq engine with smoothed-over piston tops and friendlier cast-iron heads w/194 intakes. If you begin to push the envelope-be prepared to pay the piper. The piper being pre-detonation occuring during minor throttle 'cruising' conditions. Cast-iron heads and 'balanced' hyperueretic pistons,poised on tempered,stress relieved rods acting upon an internally balanced nodular iron crank-shaft,circulating through a balanced oil suspension, will be very forgiving of heat and speed extreams. In other words, the engine will live beyond some parameters of extreme exploitation,if, you limit the time, it has to endure these extremes.|`|DV4xyeChaa	i had a 600 edlebrock on my regular performer and it was great....edle's are simpler than hollys ...the 750 should work ok..i thing the 600 will give better throttle response.[low end] and not loose much at top....the fact you r getting rid of the victor tells me your looking for more off the line|`|NZO3Nr0Baa	To figure out the CFM's needed you multiply the engine displacement by the max rpms then divide by 3456......so.....<br>  <br>  350 X 6000 = 2,100,000 divide by 3456= 607 CFM's......<br>  <br>  This is with a max rpm of 6000..... so the 600 CFM Edelbrock will be perfect....
