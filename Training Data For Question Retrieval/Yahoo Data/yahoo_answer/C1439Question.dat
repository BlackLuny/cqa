20090131125850AA1ugXG	Social Science;Psychology	Possible causes, and possible explanations. ?	Let's say that a person has no history of drug use, and problems with the law. Let's also that the only areas that the individual would frequent woudl be the place of residence and the educational institution. The person uses a computer. The person had not fouled up any relationships with people for several years, with the exception of one person who obviously moved on 6 yrs ago. What would be the possible trigger factor for that person to suddenly be subject to negative treatment from certain people they know? If the people belong to different networks, yet some may have been on the same networking list on a site, why woudl they not tell the individual when confronted?
20090131143542AAPKG1a	Social Science;Psychology	Would this categorize me as a man-hater?	I'm only 22 (just turned 22 this month) and already I don't want to be bothered with men, because I don't trust them. I'll be on the street and some gross mf comes up and asks me my number and I get spooked. Men of all ages have done this, when I'm out and about. It freaks me out cuz I don't know what they are thinking.   I'd rather have a friendship based on love and not some sexual illicit crap. Otherwise, let me stay single and celibate for the rest of my years.
20090131143852AA0xtYk	Social Science;Psychology	What do you think about this?	If a person was born in a place where no one else lived and that person grew up by their selves not seeing a mirror of what they look like and not seeing any other person, not even an image of another human. BTW this person is a male. And suddenly two women show up, one who is supposedly considered beautiful in society's standards and media standards and another who is not considered very beautiful in our society. What do you think will happen if the male's instincts kick in that are telling him he should mate with one of these women, would he pick the woman that is considered beautiful or the one who is not considered beautiful even though this man has never seen a woman before.

20090131143801AAzdOLz	Social Science;Psychology	Is it normal to fear talking to people face-to-face?	Every time I talk to people, I feel like they're so close and can just see every detail on my face.  Every pore, blemish, hair, wrinkle, etc..  This prevents me from socializing more and makes me apprehensive about dating since someone would end up in my face (if we kissed) and I'd be too self-conscious about it.        Does anyone else have this problem?  If you don't have this problem, do you notice all the flaws on someone's face when you talk to them?What can I do to not think about it?

20090131145952AAFONRd	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Is it weird that he doesn't ALWAYS include me when he's with friends? I don't think so.?	My mom, my boyfriend and I were talking about our weekend plans this afternoon. He hung out with his two girlfriends and one guy friend last night, and this Saturday night and tomorrow is our time together, and I don't see anything wrong with that. She, however, does, and I don't understand why. I'm just like him in that I don't enjoy meshing my groups of people. Group A sticks to group A and so-forth. I HAVE met these particular friends and they're very nice. He's invited me to do other things together and I've accepted. WHAT in the world is going on in my mom's head to make her think that it's alright to lose your identity whilst in a relationship whereby the two of you do eeeverything together alll the time? I will NEVER date a man who is okay in telling waitresses, "Oh, -we- don't eat ketchup with our fries." It's like ... dude, YOU can eat ketchup if you want, you know??      What a strange, strange generation. I can't help to worry though that her wisdom has something on me and that I should be worried that he didn't invite me last night. Now she's got me paranoid ... argh. By the way, we're both 22.

Everything turns black, except for the stairs that's always been brown, and still is now. I fall off, spinning around yet I get a really pleasant, warm feeling all over my body.

They expect to buy a house, have a great career, make lots of money, drive a nice car, get married to their soul mate, have kids, etc etc etc.      Why is this? Whats the big rush? If you do it all in your 20's... what will you do from age 30 to 80?

20090226082010AAaCjtJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreams about religious/spiritual conversion?	Last night I had two separate dreams. The first dream was that I converted to Judaism, and I was in some place devoted to the Jewish community, like a hall (I believe it was inside a synagogue) and people were reciting prayers.       The second dream was that I found my way to a pagan club (my actual spiritual beliefs are an eclectic/blended path of paganism) and that we were outside (the class). The woman teaching was getting to know all of us, and for each of us she wrote down astrological symbols on the chalkboard (showing my Leo sun/Scorpio rising). It was very beautiful and green (the environment).       I just thought the dreams were interested and how Paganism came right after Judaism. I totally respect both paths, and I am a Pagan myself, but I also have a high respect for Judaism as well. What could this be about?

20090131155629AAoW2Qv	Social Science;Psychology	Why do IQ test scores have such a high standard deviation?	I, for instance, have an above average IQ, but I am not a genius.  So, since the average IQ is 85-115, I can extrapolate that my IQ is 116-125, which I call 120.   Using this logic, shouldn't IQ tests for non genius people and mentally deficient people have a standard deviation of 5 and not 15.  15 is insanely wide in my opinion.  I understand that this would change the bell curve, however.  For instance, a person with an IQ of 100 could be as low as 85 and as high as 115.  That's much too wide.

Would i know if i had ADD, autism , aspergers , OCD or bi-polar?            basically im 31 now, suffered a very hard, tough life, years ago i was diagnose with borderline personality disorder and my psychiatrist accepted i have symptoms of PTSD disorder to.      in the past my symptoms have been : impulsive outbursts of rage in public, difficult controlling aggression and rage ; antisocial anger towards people ; spacing out ( dissociation ) - persecutory paranoia , agoraphobia , intense panic and anxiety feelings when outside , palpitations ; a feeling of feeling abandoned and out of control : always found it difficult to concentrate and absorb information : ( although ive read books and understood them ) : keep having to re read sentences to understand them : mind drifts off whilst reading a page of words.      always had low self esteem, difficulty interacting, forming and maintaining friendships . im very intellectual and are often told im very intelligent, understand things well, talk well , and have a good mind. have a good imagination. can converse very well.      as a kid was quite hyperactive, always running around , but calmed alot into teenage years.      my mind always races every day, racing thoughts, keep forgetting things , my mind feels scattered with thoughts, difficulty trying to organise and structure.   have obsessive worrying thoughts about physical, mental health.      now those are all the symptoms i can think of that ive always experienced.            ive NOT been diagnosed with ADD , aspergers , autism , ocd or bi polar - and my psychiatrist was adamant i dont have those disorders.            iam presently working with the mental health services although the therapy i want is not available ( psychotherapy ) because of lack of resources and funding, i have to accept what theyre offering which is an OT worker to go out into society to help me get integrated because ive been reclusive a long time now..            i want to know from what i described does it sound like i have any of the disorders mentioned ?      is it important if i have them to get them diagnosed and treated ?      if i do have those disorders would i know it ? and would they prevent me from getting on with life like education and career and learning etc ???         my moods fluctuate from being deeply depressed, despairing, abandoned, lonely, to feeling ok again the next hour , then the next hour to feeling ANGRY, ENRAGED , full of anxiety , mind racing constantly . see thinks in BLACK and WHITE etc. unstable impulsive moods...      this is why i agree i have BPD .            but im also worrying do i have those other disorders...?         ive been told i probablly dont have aspergers or bi polar or autism or ocd which came as a relief recentley.

I would like for someone to help me understand and/or figure out why I sometimes become deeply infuated with other women.  Two times in my life I have felt emotionally and physically attracted to another women but could not/can not do anything about it.  One of those times is currently happening to me.    My branch is currently working with an all new staff, so we have had an employee from another branch come in to help us out. It hasn't gone unoticed by me that she is pretty, young and an outgoing woman that I feel attracted to as a friend.  I like her a lot and feel like I want to know her outside of work, but I am afraid to ask.

Okay so I see a physiologist (I'm pretty sure), for my anxiety, and I have been since late September every Friday. I usually have a hard time opening up to people, and talking, but I'm just starting to. So anyway, I went yesterday and she gave me a piece of paper and  pen. She told me to write something down that I wanted to talk about. There was/still is something I want to talk about, but I just couldn't do it. She asked me a couple of more times through the session but I kept saying there was nothing. I left regretting it so much. I woke up this morning crying, knowing I have to wait until Friday to talk to her. I am again now to. I don't know if its because I have to wait, and I wanted her help before this week or that I'm upset with myself for still not being able to tell her much even though I've been seeing her since September. The thing is, I feel really bad after each session because I don't talk alot, even if she asks a question. I've told her that, and she said that she understood that its hard for me to talk to people, and to not feel guilty. I just can't help it.   So please give me some help on what to do to not feel this way, and to not keep thinking about how long I have to wait to tell her.   Thanks.

She then started vomiting, and I decided to call and ambulance, but the operater said the traffic was so bad and they would be a long time.

20090131173121AAKIvK2	Social Science;Psychology	Why people do not change?	i was thinking and i realized that one of the reasons why people do not change even tho they are making themselves miserable by continuing their behavior is becauase they accept that role. for example, if someone is fat and they hate being fat, and want to be skinny so bad. but still they never change. could the reason be because they just think that being fat is who they are and think that they will never change and life will always be the same for them. if they believed that they determined ever thing they did, and they are not identified by their weight, do u think it would be different? what do you guys think?

But do women really care about this kind of thing? I mean, I always thought that sluts only care about it and if you have a loving girlfriend that they won't care what the size is because they love you or whatever. So, does it really matter?

I mean he completely ignores me and then if I say hello, he acts like..'oh hi, I didn't see you there' or like I'm just something he hardly noticed at all. Like I am nothing. BUT if I am dressed casually, he smiles and me and makes an effort to say hello. Why is that? Is he afraid that I am dressing up to impress him? But if that's the case, then why bother being friendly the next day? And if he just wants friendship, then why not just be consistent and say hello the whole time, or not at all? In the past he said he wanted me etc, but I turned him down often cause he surrounds himself with women and I didn't want to be just another one. I mean he is totally confident with far better looking women than me and is known as a flirt.   The other day he acted like he didnt see me in the office, but I caught him looking me up and down when he thought I wasn't looking. Then he started singing really loudly and whistling to himself as he left and You could hear him singing really loudly outside the door.

Ok, i'm a psychology major in my first year of college, but i haven't learned enough to figure this out.    A few months ago i moved from Texas to illinois to live with my grandmother, she helped me get sober, fix my eating disorder, and got me into college. Her and my grandfather have given me this wonderful, and happy life, more than my biological parents did. They supported me doing drugs, gave up on me at 14 and left me to do whatever i wanted to, no matter how self destructive.    So my question is, why do i suddenly feel angry towards my grandparents? i get annoyed with little things they do, and feel the need to start fight with them for no reason at all. I don't know why, im happier here than i ever was, so why am i doing this?   Please, and thank you in advance

20090131172658AA0P34g	Social Science;Psychology	Reallyyyyy bad dream.. please help? :(?	im 14 years old, im a freshman (girl), i have been goin through a lot lately, with parents and other issues. i am very intereste in philosophy but i think i have foun myself in a "philosophical trap". ummm i kind of depressed right now, i have a lot on my mind. on of my reallyy close friends is suicidal.. and that bothers too. umm i don't have a best friend now. i had a few before but they all leave.. and i feel i don't need one. just close friends is fine for me. well that descibes enough i guess for now but on to the point of this . i had a reallyyy bad bad dream the other day. i told my friend about it, and she told me it is like a horror movie. well on to my dream, it started like:      a bunch of friends and i were in a lake over the summer and we were swimming and having a blast. the group of friends that i was with was rather strange because it was old friends that are no longer friends to me, and reallyyyy close friends. so as we were swimming in the lake one of my friends went missing, we were looking for her and then there was red in the water. then a body floated to the top and she was dead. everyone screamed and ran out of the water and into the woods. and someone else went missing, there was a path of blood and we followed it and saw another friend dead.. and then like one by one everyone kept dissapearing and dying.. one by one. so then it was me and one person (who i consider my closest friend but im not her closest friend.. im 14 she's 15) left we are scared to death, and somewhere we found a sword lying in the grass... the thing that was killing everyone finally came out.. and we killed that "thing" whatever it was.. and you would think problem over right.. wrong. so me and my last friend that isn't dead were walking..we were lost had no idea where we were going. and we ended up on the top of some clift... and inside the canyon.. was a longgg drop and a small lake (the one we were swimming in before) at the bottom.. that just happened to be a redish color. and you could see bodies floating in the lake... my friends that were killed.. and my friend and me saw it.. i started crying.. and backing away from the clift side.. and then i start talking to my friend... saying not living is better then living life without friends... and my friend is like what the eff are you talking about you can't be serious and so on.. and then my friend runs to try and grab me but i started running.. so it's basically a race to the edge of the clift... and i get a foot off of the clif then my friend ended up grabbing my arm just in time before it was too late. and i was crying in her arms on the floor with her and then my friend just gave me a long talk and i think it pretty much ended there.      it was like through out the whole dream.. the friends killed we in the order that they were no longer friends with me.. and when it was over i just woke up crying like ohhh my gosh that was sooo crazyyy. any ideas on it? and help is very much appreciated, thank you

20090131174025AAhNlGx	Social Science;Psychology	Have I lost my chance at having a relationship with this man?	I met a man at work over a year ago. We work in the same department, and have mutual attraction for each other (but no relationship ever happened). What did happen is that I fell for him, and badly. He knows this to some degree, and said relationships can happen only outside the office.    I like him very much, but I may have mistakenly and innocently jeopardized his job -- and mine (I brought to light some things new management should never had known about, but did not do so because I wanted to be malicious or hurt anyone). He seems to feel that I should have known better and that if anyone should be cut, it should be me. He's very scared of being cut.    I can't get him to talk to me alone because he looks afraid of me, yet I feel he still has some feelings toward me. I see that he talks to or emails his former ex-girlfriend or ex-wife, and I feel so helpless and lonely. On the weekends, I think he must be with her, and I wish it were me.    I don't know why he doesn't see how much I care for him. I just want to be with him, but need to support myself and pay my bills too.    Maybe I'm nuts for liking a guy who won't support me, but I do, and very much.

20090226090648AAJES4Z	Social Science;Psychology	How can OCD affect the following?	Let's say that you have OCD but no compulsion unless you consider unintentional stray thoughts as a compulsion even though you're not doing it on purpose nor are you compelled/forced to do so.      Let's say that ever since you started being treated for OCD with therapy and medicine, even two years from now your balance improved, you walk faster, your hearing improved, you remember things more, you learn faster and a lot more.      Before being treated you had a heck of a time with balance and you couldn't walk next to someone because you'd unconsciously walk into them.  You walked really slow and you kept forgetting things you learned really quick.  You couldn't drive, cook, work or anything.   Now being treated you can walk next to someone without walking into them, you learn faster, you can concentrate, you can cook and drive with ease because your mind is quiet.

20090226085318AAnWHbM	Social Science;Sociology	Worrying about stupid stuff?	hey everyone i suffer from OCD/anxiety and i have been worried sick for the past 11 months because while moving i threw out my old 40gb laptop hard drive without thinking..and have read alot about idenity theft and it just scared me sending me into a complete obsession over my personal information being found and someone finding out everything about me, even though eveything was deleted from the drive, i know things can still be recovered ..after 11 months odds are it has been destroyed right? i would have known by now if anyone had found it. Basically i am just wondering if it could even survive being put through the trash process..it was just a small laptop hard drive outside of its case..usually if you just drop them they are toast. i also heard the trash from my town goes to the local power plant to be incincerated so the only chance it could have been found is point a to point b. What do you guys think?      I cant seem to get these thoughts out of my head and this has completely taken over my life..any help would be great i am really suffering here, i just really dont know what else to do..i am on paxil and have considered therapy but i dont know if that will even help me..       I have always had obsessions throughout my life. But not one that has gripped one so violently like this. I am sure people are sick of seeing me ask this, but it is theraputic for me to get reassurance, although i know it is not a solution. I guess i just feel silly seekign therapy for something so ridiculous. It is embarrassing.      I want to try and get over this without going to therapy, i am just not sure how.      Should i seek therapy? I have already checked my credit report and what not, but i always seem to just tell myself it just hasnt happened YET
20090131203016AA5XIv5	Social Science;Psychology	Do you think it's funny for people to try to get attention away from themselves?	Recently, I was talking to a teacher, and I was nervous. I'm a really shy person and most people can tell that. So I'm sitting there looking all nervous and my teacher was asking me some questions about my report card and grades and stuff. So mostly I just replyed with a nod or 'I don't know'...and with every answer, she would laugh a little. Eventually she told me she wasn't laughing at me, she was laughing at how I try to get as little attention as possible. It sounds just like me, so she's not wrong, but I just don't see why it's funny. Do you? If so, could you explain?

20090131205102AAWVBL1	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Who can I talk to right NOW that can listen? Any sites or IMs that can just listen to me?	I guess right now, I'm pretty depressed and I just...want someone to talk to, but every site I've found involves calling on the phone and waiting weeks or hours for replies.    Does anyone know of someone I can talk to NOW that can just listen to me and maybe give a little advice? I feel scared and alone, and just...I don't know. I'm not above e-mails or AIM or yahoo messenger.

20090131202125AAXCqHy	Social Science;Psychology	The types of people that are drawn to you in life?	Is it true that people who were abused earlier in life, or had very tough childhoods, somehow attract abusers to themselves the rest of their lives?      How does this happen?      And does the converse happen? i.e if  you're very confident, odds are that you'd attract more of the similar crowd to yourself?       Personally I have all kinds of friends, but I've heard this theory again and again.

I thought to get to a man's heart we should either thread our way through the blood vessels in the groin or arms with a catheter, or just cut open his chest.

Ha ha...I get the joke,      but in all honesty the better looking men generally have better social ques and it generally is the unattractive guys who act too aggressive/ are much more desperate...      I am NOT biased. In my experiences and my friends.      Anyone else?

20090226090954AAu8ooh	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why do some WOMEN think the word "friends", means nothing more, you can have sex with your friends, can't you?	Ha, ha, ha.  I mean,  it is not against the rules or anything like that.   If you are a woman,   and you like a guy,  and he is your friend.  It   is fine to have sex with him,  even if you are not in a relationship   together.  Friends with benefits,  ha,  good luck with that one.     If a man and a woman are together, and they share a common bond,   sex is fine.  It is not that big of a deal,  like some of you prudes like   to make it.  If you think that you do not want to pursue a relationship   after the sex,  then that is up to the both of you.  So why do some   women think that if you are friends only,  with a man,  then sex is   off limits.   Are you not compromising the relation anyway,  when you   say it cant be so..................
20090131144615AApGi9B	Social Science;Psychology	How important are looks in finding jobs?	I'm thinking I'll probably end up working in some office job wearing a suit and tie, but I was wondering are looks any important in finding these types of jobs. Like I'm not very attractive and also kinda of not normal looking cause my head is kinda big for my body( I think I have macrocephaly) but I'm really hardworking person but you know how it is in the real world where mostly everyone not judge but you know like criticize other people's looks so I'm kinda worried that some of these employers might not hire me cause of how I look. I already get ripped and insulted by many of my peers in high school and I'm kinda worried that my looks might affect me in finding a job.

20090131143501AAXSOc1	Social Science;Psychology	I think I see something, and I begin involuntarily screaming at night?	I have done this so often in the past. I would be lying in bed, with my eyes closed. As I open my eyes, I see something strange, today it was somebody leaning right over my bed. It felt so real, and if it was a dream it was amazingly vivid - all the details of the room were exact.       I'm shocked by the person hovering above me, and start screaming my head off, waking up everybody in the household. I'm just a little concerned that this happens involuntarily, I can't control myself screaming, and at every time that I see something in the darkness, I do believe that I'm not dreaming, and that it is real.       This usually happens at around 2-3 at night, when I wake up.       I know people wake up due to nightmares, but I think I'm hallucinating. I am under no extreme stress at all, and I lead a pretty healthy life...does anybody know what this could mean?      PS. not to sound crazy...but the things I see do seem real, and even during the day I contemplate if they were actually real or not.      Please help... :[

20090226091828AABwumX	Social Science;Psychology	Has anyone taken the MBTI test?	Hello, recently I started going to some forums and asking how i can become more outgoing because i'm a very quiet person and i tend to keep to myself a lot. Some people started to say something about Introversion and i decided to look it up, well i usually do when i don't understand something. I found out there's a test to find out your personality. I took the test and the description of myself was surprisingly accurate. I'm going to take a look at the other personalities because i guess i'm sort of a skeptic and don't really take these things too seriously.       Anyways, i was wondering how accurate are these tests and are they somewhat legit? I took the test multiple times at multiple sites and i got the same results all the time.       If you haven't taken this test it's pretty fun to read about yourself after you find out the results, don't take it too seriously though! Oh yea i'm an INTP if anyone was wondering :).
