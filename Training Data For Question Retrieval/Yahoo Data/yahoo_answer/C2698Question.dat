I seen this add on craigslist that said "needing papers for a pit bull?" out of curiosity I emailed him (my dogs are already registered) and asked him what he had... He said 2 ADBA and 1 UKC..He said he had already sold the UKC to someone for $50...This is getting ridiculous, these people now have fake papers on their dog, will more than likely breed and sell pups at registered puppy price, while those people are more than likely getting mutts. I gave him a piece of my mind, and have not received a response yet.       So my question is....If you had a dog that was not registered, and someone offered papers to you, would you take them?   If yes, why?

Is there any smell that's safe to use around an infant that would repell them. Baby gates don't work as I have seen both jump to the top of two stacked on top of each other. I've read about using rosemary here:  http://www.answerbag.com/articles/How-to...  but rosemary is related to catnip and even with the fresh stuff it hypes the cats up like the catnip does. I'd like to be able to leave the door open with the gates up and not worry too much about the cats going into the room.

I'm going to feed him something healthy with no animal byproducts etc.   We have been feeding him Natural Value wet food but he eats 1 to 2 cans a day so it's too much $.   And you have to throw away a Lot of garbage.   I would love to cook for him and give him some canned food on the side.   But we are in the process of moving and It's too hard to do right now.   I think I'm going to feed him dry food with some wet food.   I've herd that dry food is not very good for cats especially male cats.   Which makes sense dry food is well dry and very dead.   The time he has ever had dry food it was Evo and he did NOT do well with it.   Any way do you know of any good cat foods that are healthy and not to much $$$(at least for natural food)   Thank you!   I will pick best answer.   P.s. PLEASE I'm NOT going to feed him Purina or any thing like that.   Please keep it nice.

I made it by myself from my heart-      TOGETHER WE ONCE WERE-      Together we once were,   as happy as could be,   But luck soon fades,   including you and me.      I wish It couldn't be so,   although I know it's true,   And that the last thing that I said,   was ''I love you''.      The lives we shared together,   was so connected,   Now the hearts are fading,   and will soon be detected.      There will never be another guinea pig,   As soft and as sweet as you,   And I wish I had another chance,   To say much more than ''I love you''.      As time pushes us apart,   I will never forget,   The time we once had together,   Is now in debt.      When I see the sun setting,   I think of you,   But It's not the same,   As me being with you.      I know our time is up,   And I know It was short,   It's what nature does,   But I still wish for more.      I can see the sunlight fading,   Right before my eyes,   And when that time happens,   It's time to say Good bye!

Right now they are being fed one scoop three times a day (morning, dinner, and before bed).  Our male cat Nigel LOVES food.  He meows and meows when he wants to eat so we are sure to feed him.  We had to start giving him a scoop before bed because he would wake my boyfriend up to feed him.  He is getting a bit "puffy" and I worry about him.  I would feed him diet food but we have a female who is just fine (for now).  I am actually a little afraid that if we feed him less he will just eat my female cats food to substitute for it.  Any suggestions of what to do?

20090304231421AAqHwNJ	Pets;Cats	How can i tell when a cat is about to go into labor?	I recently found a stray cat that we believe was dumped in our parking lot. Because we let her out a few times a day but she will not leave out parking lot. Only to use the bathroom and than she always comes back to our step. And she will lay there until someone opens the door. And we knew from day one she was pregnant but now you can obviously tell as her stomach has grown more bigger and rounder in these last few days. And her stomach moves from side to side when she walks. Also she will not allow us to touch her stomach she will growl if we even come close to touching it. She also will not allow anyone else but me to pick her up so I was wondering how will i know when she is about to deliver? Or do they have any web sites of cats in different stages of pregnancy? I been keeping her in my room at night and the first two nights she slept over my bed and wouldn't let me touch her. But know she wants to be on my bed as a matter of fact i put a pillow next to me in bed and put her on it but she insist on laying above my head with her feet touching me. So i was wondering if this maybe a sign???

20090304233402AAJubcm	Pets;Other - Pets	My bunny is eating her poop on my bed, why?	So my bunny is young and a girl, zoie.She is slowly learning to  poop only in her cage and she only pees in her cage, except for on top of my bed. As of just 45 seconds ago she was sitting next to me biting on my blanket, then I look again... she pooped one poop and ate 1/2 of it and then jumped away from the rest. Why is she doing this, and why on my bed? I've never seen her do it before, I would keep her on the ground but she can jump on my bed. Help!       P.s. Moving my bed higher is not an option and I refuse to put her in her cage when I am home.
20090304233728AAAsVyt	Pets;Cats	I think my cat may have a tumor?	My cat is pregnant, only with a couple weeks left. There is something by her spine, let me try to explain this. Her spine is horizontal, and it is verticle touching her spine like a T. It's oval, about the length of my pointer finger and maybe an inch in diameter. I'm not sure if this is a kitten or what... it doesn't feel like a kitten. It feels like a tight little gland. And it's also a bit too high to be a kitten. When I touch it my cat acts as if she is in pain, and cries out. I just noticed it, it can't have been there longer than a week. I've been messing with her constantly and I just noticed it today. I'm quite worried. I am giving her to a new owner soon. I have notified the new owner of what I have found, and he has agreed to take her to the vet. I was just worried about her and wondering if this may be a tumor. Will it affect the kittens health? Will she be alright? Thank you, I appreciate any help.

20090304233854AA0Prll	Pets;Dogs	Why is my puppy's poop not solid?	My puppy fell off of a chair and he is limping. I called a few people who are very experienced with dogs and they said that if he isn't crying, then it's not broken. They also said that it's probably just sore so I'm deciding to wait a few days.       Also, I've noticed that his poop isn't solid. I mean, it was before he has the accident but now it's kind of like pudding but a tiny bit more solid.       Does it have anything to do with him not eating the right kind of food or does it have to do with his accident and hurting his foot?

It's kind of like pudding but more solid than that. I'm wondering if it's because of his accident from falling off of the chair or if it has something to do with what he eats?

20090305010043AAUuK6j	Pets;Cats	How do I get my kitten to stop this?	Whenever it is time to eat (I live alone with a dog and two cats--one is a kitten), the kitten decides that is the time to use the restroom.      I live in a small place to save money, so the scent can fill up the whole house pretty quick.  I'm glad I'm dropping some pounds over this, but it would be nice to be able to have a meal at the house again.      I thought it might just be her body schedule, so I tried changing my meal time; but she just did it at the new time instead.      I'm not sure it is a wise thing to get her with a spray bottle; the last thing I want is to make her think she should not use the litter box, and then I have even more problems.      What else can I do?  Any ideas?      Thanks for any help.

20090305012353AAa1hCa	Pets;Cats	What type of breed is my cat?	I just want to know what type of breed my cat may be. I was thinking he MIGHT be part ragdoll. He's very sweet, loves sleeping with my boyfriend and I, loves sitting on laps/chests, and when he meows, it's not a normal meow, more like a "brrripp", if you know what I mean, like a chirp. He also likes to lick hands.      He has a semi long coat and his tail is the fluffiest part of him besides his cheeks. His toe pads are pink and his "palm" pads are mostly black. If you can't see in the pictures, his eyes are a light green. I know ragdolls have blue eyes, but the way he acts makes me think he may have some percentage of ragdoll.       Any guesses?       Here are some pictures.       http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l145/t...     http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l145/t...     http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l145/t...     http://i95.photobucket.com/albums/l145/t...

The thing is that one of my mollies was pregnant and about an hour ago I noticed her hiding and breathing hard so I thought she would give birth soon so I placed her in the breeding box, about 15 minutes later she started having fry.

The bird loves my husband big time.  She is very smart and talks alot.  My husband was thinking about breeding them in the future, and our concern is if the birds will pair up because one is so bonded to us.   We know forsure that one is a male and the other is female cause we had them tested.   We don't want to breed them for profit.  We just love them alot and would like to have more.     When the male is mature enough our concern is that they may not bond because of the bond my husband has with the oldest bird.   I don't know if it will really be an issue or not, but since we don't have any experience with this, I thought I would ask.      Our new bird, already is talking.

My friend bought my pup's little brother and they want to go to the dog park tomorrow! I'm a little nervous since there may be other dogs with diseases in the park. Since my pup isn't fully vaccinated, I'm worried that he may catch something. Should I skip the park? Or am I paranoid?      Also, I live in a condo with lots of dogs. I want to start training him to pee outside. Is it safe to walk him on short walks to get him to get the hang of it? If I shouldn't, how long should I wait? Thanks!

You know, those annoying cat meow sounds that sometimes sound like they're dying and come from outside at all hours of the night? I went outside to throw water on the bushes and saw two long hair cats in the neighbor's yard standing close to eachother and meowing together, loudly, loudly, loudly. They've been at it for over an hour! What's going on? If they're in heat, why can't they just do it and get it over with so I can sleep???
20090305000620AAwJiUE	Pets;Rodents	Is there any way to determine the traits of baby guinea pigs before birth?	What I mean is, if you have a female guinea pig that's a Crested Cavy, and the father is an Abessinian Cavy, is there anyway to know what the babies will or are more likely to look like. Do baby guinea pigs generally look like the mother or the father (whether same type or not)? Or is it like human babies (no sure way of knowing). Is it even possible for different types of guinea pigs to breed, or is that some kind of impossible cross-breeding?            P.S., I am not an animal breeder, NOR AM I interested in becoming a breeder, I am just wondering. I have a female guinea pig (crested) with a very "different" color pattern...one that I've never seen before, and am just interested in their traits and how breeding may influence this.

20090305001922AAzroKR	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone know if Kong Ziggies are safe for dogs?	My dogs mean the world to me and I just discovered that rawhide could be bad for dogs as well as Nylabone...both of which my dogs love so much. I loved giving them rawhide; I would give them at least 2 of the granulated ones a day because it gave me sometime to myself since my dogs are kind of needy...      I don't ever want to put my dogs at risk of something that could harm them, but I know anything really can so I'm just looking for a safer alternative and my dogs seem to really like the Kong Ziggies...   I couldn't find anything bad about it online so I was wondering if anyone had any bad experiences with it or heard of any.      Also, how long before you know if something is wrong with your dog due to rawhide and what are the symptoms...and could the problem just linger and one day the dog gets really ill or is it an immediate thing?      Sorry, for rambling and all these questions...I'm just so worried that I already might have harmed them with all the rawhide and Nylabone I feed them...      Thank you in advance

20090305005338AAgiTQc	Pets;Dogs	Question about registering dog?	I am registering my dog with NKC. I am not going to breed, and I realize NKC is not really a legit registry, only reason I am wanting to register him through it is so I can start in weight pulling. I need help filling out the form though.It asks for the sire and dam and then goes on for a 3 generation ped. anyways. I am wanting to know if I need their reg names and number, or if just their call names would work. The sire is reg. so I can fill out all of his side, but I do not know their numbers and reg names, I would have to find all of that out. Thanks for any help.      O also would it be worth it to do the DNA to prove he is purebred or not? How much does that cost.Thanks.
20090305011707AALWE6Z	Pets;Fish	Why do my fish keep dying?	i don't know if it's because of the water not being right because i haven't checked it yet, or if it's stress from the gourami that's in there that keeps taunting and trying to nip the tail fins of the other fish because i found out AFTER i bought him that he was territorial. so far i've had about 5 or 6 guppies and 3 ghost shrimp die on me. i've got 4 tetras and 2 of them i bout a couple days after i got my fish tank set up. they have been fine. they eat like the always have and seem like nothing's wrong with them. i can't figure it out. looks like if there was something wrong with the water, the first 2 tetras would have already died too. someone please help?

20090305021054AAEE3qV	Pets;Dogs	Should i allow him to breed?	A few weeks ago i adopted a gorgoeus 20 month old cocker Spaniel from a friend who didnt have time for him. He has such a brilliant nature, really good around the kids, really loving. the only problem is, as he has settled in and got to know us better he has become very noisy, fights with other male dogs, growls at males who enter the house, and barks at his own shadow. (literally) He gets on fine with older male dogs and all females. We have a great area on our beach that allows dogs off the lead, but Im always too scared he'll start a fight. He's such an energetic dog, and as he's a spaniel, it's important that he gets off the lead to run. I got the vet to check him over recently for other reasons, and the vet said that the only way to calm this is to neuter. the problem is, he is from an excellent bloodline and his previous owner was very keen for him to stud. his coat is quite unual and he scores very high, (I dont know alot about these things, my last dogs were pound rescues), There is a local breeder who has requested him as her next stud. What would you do? Im not a breeder and know very little about it. To me he is a family dog, but also understand the wish that his bloodline continues.  Any advice?

Usually, she would be eating Purina Sensitive Systems and would be fine, but she continued throwing it up. I think this is actually because she has VERY few teeth left, and she just swallows it whole (the vomit is still all solid food).  Instead, we've been giving her different brands of wet foot, though its hard to find it in the ground-up style that she can eat.  However, recently I've noticed what I think is a type of diarrhea in her litter box.  Its light brown, which is bizarre, and i'm worried about her being sick.  Any help?

I'm thinking maybe getting a Falabella or a Shetland or 2, something small and that my daughter can grow confinence with before getting a larger pony she can ride.

20090305030811AAUQN0m	Pets;Dogs	How do you feed your dog?	Do you do the 20 minute thing where he gets 20 minutes to finish and then take it away until next feeding or do you leave it out for him to nibble whenever.    You see, my doggy is a little fussy with the brands of food we get him, obviously we try to get him the better, more nutritional food and have finally found a brand that we & him are happy with. But he doesnt finish the whole amount when feeding, and instead goes back and has a chew every once in a while.    I kow maybe that is not the best option but I dont want him to lose out on nutrition.   I have started doing the thing where he gets a certain amount and then take it away from him, finished or not finished. Will he soon learn to eat when hes told to? I know I cant eat when Im told, but eat when im actually hungry. So will it work to condition his eating times?   I should also say that he does get the right amount for his size, we do not overfeed him, he has access to go outside whenever he needs and also gets long walks. He is in tip top shape. im asking for advice not comments about my dog.

20090305024219AAhrIB7	Pets;Birds	My new cockatiel's behaviour?	Ok so i brought a new cockatiel 4 - 5 days ago, the first couple of day he was terrified of us and did absolutely nothing. Now when i come downstairs in the morning and say hello he starts moving back and forth across his perch then climbs all round the cage rubbing his beak against the bars and occasional noises. Though as soon as I approach the cage he goes to the back and watches me, he is not as terrfied of me any more but it seems he wants to be out of the cage?? It just looks very distressing but i dont want to le him out as he as he has no trust for anyone yet. Any help?

They breed constantly-usually they eat the eggs but last September I saved 9 goldfish fry, now 6 months old. I have only a 16 gallon and the 55 gallon. How many of the 6-month olds can I put in with their parents and for how long? How many full sized adults can ultimately stay if I make frequent water changes and get an even more powerful filter?
20090305024015AAu5Yyu	Pets;Horses	Can you critique the conformation of this horse or guess at his breeding?	I have recently become the owner of this horse, I don't have a lot of information on his breeding and history. So I thought I would put it out there and see what the general consensus might be.      I KNOW he is part Belgian, as all his papers say, but what would you guess his other part is? All I have officially is Belgian Cross. Some have guessed quarterhorse, but my inexperienced eye is not really seeing it. He is a gelding that has just turned 5 and is 17.3 hands.      I am newish to horse ownership (rode casually as a child/teen and have just gotten my first horse as a "grown up") and I was wondering if you could give me some pointers on understanding his conformation, for good or bad. I would also appreciate any guidelines about how to correct/or compensate for any inherent faults he may have. As well as any suggestions in the direction his training should lean towards based upon his natural talents?       http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=86...        http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=91...

I am going to take him to the vet this afternoon but I was wondering if you had any ideas what could cause it.  I woke up at midnight and there were two soaked patches on my bed.  They didn't look or smell like pee.  When we looked at him his whole mouth and chin were wet.  We changed the sheets and went back to bed.  When I got up this AM there was another bigger patch.  He is still eating and acting like normal so far.  What do yo think this could be?

They are housetrained to use paper and they also go outside when they want to through the doggy door.       My little girl will always use the paper or goes outside, she never has accidents in the house. Her brother on the other hand has started peeing where ever he wants to at all hours of the day and night. No matter what I do he refuses to use the paper anymore or go outside. He even peed on my bed the other night.       I am at my wits end cleaning up constantly (although my floors are very clean since I mop them all day long).      Does anyone have any suggestions as to what is making him act as if he is an untrained puppy instead of a 3 year old trained dog?
