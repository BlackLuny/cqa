The spots spread quickly and run together in large patches, and the white growth finally covers both sides of leaves as well as shoots, flowers and pods...." blah, blah, blah. <br>  <br>  If this sounds like the culprit, then you are in luck. Powdery Mildew spores will die in water. Wash the leaves thoroughly every day. Spray the leaves with fermented compost tea, or baking soda sprays. Increasing humidity often helps prevent the mildew from spreading to other plants.<br>  <br>  A simple baking soda spray is:<br>  1 gallon warm water<br>  3 tablespoons baking soda<br>  1 tablespoon Murphy's Oil Soap (or the generic equivilent)<br>  <br>  Mix all ingredients well and spray plant, coating both sides of the leaves thoroughly. Repeat every 7-10 days.

Ein interessantes Schicksal hat auch die Linde in Běleň unweit von Mal?ín, die als die ?lteste Linde in Südb?hmen bezeichnet wird. Sie soll um das Jahr 1200 herum ausgesetzt worden sein. In dieser Zeit gab es im unweiten Zátoň bereits 150 Jahre lang ein Kloster, und an der Stelle, wo diese Linde steht, führte bereits einige Jahrhunderte lang ein Landesweg von Vy??í Brod (Hohenfurt) zur ?unteren Furt“ in Zátoň. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Im rosenbergischen Urbar aus dem Jahr 1374 wird Bělens Hof angeführt, und da die ?Sippenlinden“ beim Bau der Fundamente des Bauernhofes ausgesetzt wurden, l?sst es sich schlie?en, dass auch Bělens Hof an der Wende vom 11. zum 12. Jahrhundert gegründet wurde. Unter der Linde Bělens Hofes lagerten Hussitenheere sowie Armeen w?hrend des Drei?igj?hrigen Krieges. Seit 1518 stand neben der Linde das Gerichtshaus, wobei das hiesige Gericht au?er Běleň auch Zábraní, Branná und Poustevna verwaltete. Unter der Regierung Peter Woks von Rosenberg, als die Linde vierhundert Jahre alt war, stand ein Stück davon entfernt Pabls Mühle, und die m?chtige Linde war auch von der Lojzas und Syneks Mühle zu sehen. <br>  <br>  In der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts waren in Běleň 16 Bauernh?fe und bei den meisten von ihnen stand auch eine Sippenlinde. Aber Bělens Linde hatte schon damals nicht ihresgleichen in der Gegend. Es trafen unter ihr die Bewohner bei Taufen, Hochzeiten sowie Beerdigungen. Von ihr gingen auch 87 deutsche Bewohner von Běleň bei der Nachkriegsaussiedlung und im Jahr 1946 kamen zu ihr 67 neue Besiedler, überwiegend rum?nische Reemigranten. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Als die Linde mit einem Umfang von zw?lfeinhalb Metern im Jahr 1951 vom Blitz getroffen wurde und abbrannte, schien es, dass es ihr Ende ist. Aber es ist etwas überraschendes passiert. W?hrend die Gemeinde Běleň unterging, erholte sich die Linde und lebt weiter. <br>  <br>  (fs)

ca4485503833a540b7653c0d26f6bc9baa	The doors you are refering to are called pocket doors-- once they get off track they can be a real aggravation--The only advice I could give without actually seeing the problem would be to try to pry up or down on it with a long crowbar to see if you can get it back into it's track;usually the rollers are spring loaded so they stay tight on the track. The spring may be broken or possibly the whole roller assembly is missing/broken.

Man handle it. Wiggle it around if you can. If you pry on the top of the door downward, it might slightly tilt the back of the door upward and free the rollers. If the rollers are on the top as in a hanging door, pry up from the bottom and wiggle around. Hope this helps.

Water, seeking it's own level, then flows out over the trap into the main drain line and usually, if the line allows for free enough flow, the water filling the trap and flowing over the edge starts a siphon, which then, in turn empties the bowl till enough water leaves to allow air to enter the trap, thereby breaking the siphon.   If you're toilet isn't creating a swirl to help get this siphon action started, you may want to try to clean the jets located under the rim inside the bowl.  They can get limed up with calcium deposits over the years and impede the amount of water they allow to flow readily into the bowl.|`|6ca1027218fb6c82cc59080550a0c853aa	It's not suction.  It's the weight of the water flowing from the tank into the bowl.  The toilet is designed in such a way that once there is enough weight, all the water in the bowl can drop down into the sewer pipe.

I use Echo SRM-200 units daily for 2-3 hours, 5 days a week all season long.  I've only had minor repairs for 2 years and they are still going strong. The heads are very durable and almost never jam.  In the event jamming occurs, it is easy to take head apart and restring. Also, there is very little maintenance required for the Echo.<br>  <br>  A Weedeater engine is rated much lower than the Echo.  On the label near engine is a emissions code - a letter "A" "B" or "C".  The Weedeater is rated a "C" - 50 hours where the Echo is "A" 300 hours.   It sounds like you are already running into carburetor problems, not uncommon in cheaply manufactured trimmers.  I've had my 3 Echos for 2 years and have never broken a starter string.  Also, the weedeater trimmer head is not as durable a Echo: it's easily jammed and will wear along bottom.  Jamming is a common problem with cheap trimmer heads and string.<br>   <br>  My advice would be to buy a Echo SRM-200 for around $220 at Home Depot.  They are built for heavy usage and have at least a 2yr homeowner warranty. <br>   <br>  Sometimes at base of some fences, I use Round-Up.  It will save the bottom of your fence from trimmer string scraping .  But you will have to respray 3 or 4X year, depending on conditions.
GYZgfkP5aa	If you are asking for the measurement of how steep the angle of your backyard is, you will need two dimensions, one being the length (or depth of your yard) (called the run), the second being the difference in vertical height from front to back (called the rise).  Find the run using a tape measure.  If your backyard isn't too long, you can find the rise using a garden hose.  Remember that water will always seek its own level.  You will need the hose full of water.  With help, hold one end of the hose at the ground level of the higher end (or one foot above ground to make it easier).  Hold the other end of the hose at the lower end & move up and down until the water is just at the end of the hose.  Then measure from the end of the hose to the ground.  That will give you the height difference between the two ends.  (Remember to adjust for the one foot you kept the other end above ground).  The "stepth", or slope is the ratio of the rise over the run.  For example, 100 feet run, 10 feet rise = 1:10.|`|9cc2bb3903698bcc4e6336ab3e531c4caa	mow the grass then you should find them.|`|d7yjhhOcaa	Do you mean stepth or was that a misprint for depth?

If there's a clog in the pipe downstream from your location and people upstream dump water into the system it has to go somewhere so the water backs up.

I'd go over that with a bleach and water solution after completely rinsing away the comet.<br>  <br>  Once you get it all cleaned up, buy Tilex Fresh Shower... spray your shower/bath and curtains in the shower after every shower.  It will help keep the mildew away.<br>  <br>  Also, be sure to always turn on your bathroom exhaust if your bathroom doesn't have a window you can crack when you shower.  The steam makes a breeding ground for mold and mildew.|`|9aG47Jq5aa	Looks like I was a little slow on the trigger in answering your question, but, it looks like everyone who gave you advice was right on! Bleach/Water mixture is the cheapest working method. Make SURE that you have a really good ventilation as with any chemical, for you do NOT want to breathe these in, or have it splash into your eyes. Wear gloves and goggles when scrubbing. The best way would be to just spray it on, leave the room with the fan on and come back to it to scrub after the fumes are gone. Handle X-14 in the same fashion.(although you will scrub less with this chemical). Baking soda works and I have also used plain vinegar to remove odors. Good ventilation while showering is key. Leave the fan running until the steam from your shower has went away. Spray your plastic curtain, walls and tub with Lysol spray with bleach lightly after showering.(don't forget the corners). Shower with the bathroom door open if you have no roomates around!|`|FIw5hPpsaa	first off wipe down the mold with bleach. also, usually if you put in a work order in your dorm someone will usually fix it. (make sure they clean it with bleach and don't just paint over it like they usually do. have them clean it and then paint). as for the odor, once the mold it gone, no new odor should occur. to get rid of the remaining odor air out the bathroom. also try a product called odor away, as well as, as damp/odor sponge. (you can usually find these products at a hardware store)|`|UfcsZ0uOaa	Definitely bleach or vinegar and water will take quick care of the existing mold. To prevent the mold in the future it wouldn't hurt to purchase a dehumidifier for after showers or what not. An Eva-Dry brand is relatively cheap and they seem to get good reviews. Plus they are made for smaller spaces. They are available anywhere pretty much. As for the smell, the bleach or vinegar should work, but I've found a Lysol fresh-matic sprayer does the trick.|`|AA10648704	You can kill the mold with bleach.  Make sure you're wearing old clothes, in case it drips, and wipe down the walls, ceiling or floors where the mold is.  If you can paint your bathroom, use a base coat of Kilz, which is a mold and stain blocker, so it won't come back.|`|uVy8yEjLaa	bleach and water will take care of the mold and will not let it come back.clean the mold with straight bleach and rinse with water.|`|67EYbk4xaa	try clorex bleach 1/2 full of spray bottle and add water.  This will get rid of mold and odor.|`|mXgrojCFaa	I don't know but I suggest you use MR. Clean products! I hear it works!|`|LEx6jd2Saa	yes, bleach is the best.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	There has been problems with mold in the past in the apt. complex I live in so this is what the agreement says to do if there is mold in your place.<br>   Notify the manager and they'll have someone come out and fix any leaks that might be contributing to the mold problem.<br>  Use exhaust fans in bathrooms, kitchens, and any room that gets moist frequently. For large ares:<br>  Move  furniture away from the area to be cleaned and use a solution of laundry detergent and warm water.<br>  You may also try 1/4 cup bleach to one quart of water. Wait 20 minutes and repeat. Wait again 20 minutes.<br>  Last, apply a borate-based detergent solution and do not rinse. This will prevent mold from growing in the future. To find one, look at labels of cleaning solutions in the store and see if it includes borates in the ingredients list.<br>  If your bathroom is small which I'm guessing it is becasue it's a dorm, then protect yourself with goggles gloves and breathing protection. <br>  Seal off access to the rest of the dorm.<br>  Use the solution system I described previously.|`|kTVI3KBLaa	Yep - good old cheap bleach & water.... baking soda in cups in the corners after you clean helps too!
MkwgBHNbaa	Well, I see most of the serious answerers involved lots of "colors" and "cutes". Not all 13 year olds enjoy color and cute. XD So you def. like posters and music celebs. When my sister was putting up all the posters I noticed the 'view' looks a lot better when you use the larger posters rather than several small ones just tacked around. As one of the other people mentioned, use picture frames. They would be even better if they were home made, that way you know its "you".<br>  <br>  New carpet is probably not an option for you, but you could still have your parents see about getting you some paint. People who love music usually love to express individuality, ask your parents to help you paint it with a little flare. Something that will highlight your posters.  Find a stensil you like and use it sparsley, I don't recommend covering the walls totally with the image. Remember, it doesnt have to be 'fluffy' and 'cutesy' for it to look good just because you're 13 and you're a girl. ^_^<br>  <br>  From what I understand your main concern is that even with the posters you love, the room just isn't "you". Oddly enough, the layout of your furniture may inadvertantly really be what is bothering you. Move it around a little bit. All rooms have a "good side", if a dresser or something is hiding that particular wall, give it a move! You'd be surprised how much something like that could better your mood!|`|Jw8tXQKfaa	on your closet doors u could paint musical notes. go to ross, and find really cute, fuzzy curtains to hang around your bed. hang a shelf along the perimeter of the room, bout 1 ft from the ceiling, for childish stufffed animals to be out of sight. get some cute beding and accent pillows. paint frmaes polka dotted, or whatever, for pics.|`|tBD8OLesaa	get pictures with frames or claenders with bright colors!<br>  umm cute curtains full of colos<br>  paint thr room with a cute color<br>  :)|`|Inftabk5aa	Omg, I totally feel ya if you get some really good ideas can you tell me ab them.|`|9hkEH2TBaa	yes|`|vMXk9ohSaa	Do you already have your CD covers hanging on the wall?  <br>  Have you thought of making the entire wall a collage of images - using the posters, yes, but adding tons of other things and literally covering the entire wall with images.  Not just posters and photos of your favorite celebrities.  I mean like a large color picture of your favorite pizza, animals, cartoons, copy down quotes or poems on color paper and hang that up, too.  Clip pictures out of magazines or hang up all your magazines on a wire with clips.  <br>  <br>  Check out the clearance tables at the big fabric stores and see if there is any fabric you can use to make pillows, chair covers, table cloths, bed skirts, rugs, etc. <br>  <br>  Don't forget thrift shops for unusual finds like OLD albums to hang on the wall; hubcaps, an old sequin dress, funny hats, etc.|`|z04CjFuKaa	suckah!!!
LllHGFAFaa	a) In art school, we used OHP(Over Head Projector) sheets over the palatte to mix paints on when painting with oils and acrylics.

t5x3PBqFaa	I find snapdragons are fairly easy to grow.  We originally bought  a couple of plants and put them into a nice sunny spot and watered them regularly.  They spread really easily since they seed themselves.  We've had success planting from seeds as well.  We didn't really do anything special with them, just threw them into some worked up soil, watered them, and watch them sprout. Could also be that my mom has a green thumb lol|`|AA10520442	I love my Snappers!! :)  Give them a sunny spot and watch them go.   I buy mine in flats at the nursery rather than growing from seed.  I have had Snapdragons survive several seasons if the winters are mild  ( I'm in Va. ).   They re-seed freely, too.   Deadhead the spent blooms.  That's really all there is to them.|`|89a13acab91a23463f026af6c3786580aa	I dont know if you are trying to start them from seed or if you are buying transplants from a garden store like walmart,kmart or an actual nursery. I have never tried them from seed but when I buy them at the store I have never had a bad plant infact these are supposed to be a annual but most of the time they come back for a few years. They are like a weed put them in a pot or in the ground and water them. The warmer it gets the better they do but just water them sometimes the plants in the pots get watered twice a day and I also fertilize every two weeks from May to the end of July. For the most part I think they like sunshine at least part of the day so sun to part shade. I do love snapdragons many different colors and heights to choose from. I hope this helps good luck!
gb1XYoBKaa	Take a sharp knife. Clean it with soap or alcohol to prevent any infection to the plant. <br>  Now take the bamboo stalk out of the pot and place it on a hard flat surface. <br>  Make a clean cut just about the node(joint). No need to make a slanted cut as you would have done in case of a normal cutting, root will come from all the side uniformly. <br>  Dip the cutting in a rooting harmone solution for better results. I never use rooting solution in case of lucky bamboo and still they root without any problem. Its depends on your choice. <br>  Take the cutting and place it in the pot with the rest of the lucky bamboos.<br>  <br>  Now just leave them alone and take care in normal fashion. Cutting will root in about two month's time.<br>  Spray water daily to the cut part of the mother plant to accelerate the regeneration of new branch.<br>  Though I have never seen rotting of cutting but its safer to check the cutting once a week for any rare case of rotting. If cutting rots, remove it from the arrangement.<br>  <br>  Great job. In no time you have brought your lucky bamboo arrangement to a size suitable for the pot and as a bonus you have some new lucky bamboo that you can gift to your friends on next christhmas. |`|HE0z0Jxtaa	Based on your description you are growing real bamboo, not lucky bamboo. You have a chance of rooting the bamboo only if it is a clumping type, but not if its a running type. I've tried to root my running bamboos, and they don't root.

2PTlXs9zaa	The county court house (assessor) will have plat maps for you to look at that will show you the boundaries of the properties.<br>  This happens more frequently if when the house was built they were building on a 1935 survey line, which at that time was done more by fence than county grid lines. If he has recently had a current survey done, it could be showing the corrected property lines, but I would think, as of here, the land your home sits on for 43 years would be grandfathered into a property agreement of some sort.<br>  Good Luck!|`|3uncSeZraa	Contact the lands deed office in your area and they   will advise you how to research the records.|`|898da16d64218dcc5de2e3a18fc4478daa	the county auditor website should have the dimensions of both your lots. most times with an Aeriel photo with the property lines drawn over it
848f75b2d80efbaf2e5e5b809911996faa	You'll need a bed, and either a chest or two nightstands for storage. On each nightstand, you can put a lamp, or if you opt for a chest you can put two small lamps (called buffet lamps) with something of interest in the middle ( large shell, vase, a small stack of old books, a colorful glass container, etc) You can also add this item of interest to your nightstand if you choose that for storage instead of the chest.<br>  <br>  A small chair and a small floor lamp in a corner is nice for reading and decor.<br>  <br>  A small throw rug works very well to define your reading corner or you can place it in front of the bed, depending on your layout.<br>  <br>  Inexpensive drapery panels from Target or Walmart or if you have a little more money to spend from Bed Bath and Beyond will work WONDERS on your window. They're simple and you can put up the rod and the drapes in a half hour all by yourself.<br>  Good luck.|`|NDTOJhwDaa	go to a poster store and pick out some movies/bands you're into. maybe try a cool lamp or something.

There are something like 15 different "Standard" types of concrete that are used in the building trade but the "average" weight of a "standard" block of "standard" concrete is 150 lbs per cubic foot. A cubic foot being 12" x 12" x 12" which equals 1,728 cubic inches.<br>  <br>  The block you refer to is 8" x 8" x 16" which is 1,024 cubic inches. If you factor this out you get your block weighing in at 0.592 of a standard cubic foot block, which works out at around 88.8 lbs!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps - and, bye the way, don't drop it on your foot!!!

2nmFFFQ4aa	not all IKEA furniture is particle board. We did the babies room in solid pine from IKEA. Particle board is cheap and doesnt hold up well, look in the catalog and find solid wood items in there. They are still much cheaper then most other stores.

ufpdSvAaaa	There could be a number of issues. It could be that the durabond(easy sand) didn't bond too well to the thinner based glue. Typically you want to prime the glue(with XIM) before skimming over it. But, I don't think thats the problem. Any time you stripe a wall you want to paint(finish coat) over where your transitions(taped lines) are going to be. For instance if your painting the top of the wall white and the bottom tan.. you want to paint the white about a foot below your breaking point(make sure you feather out so u dont get a ridge) Allow to dry 1 or 2 days.. then use "blue" masking tape to make your line. The tape won't stick as well to the finish as it would to the primer.  Primer is made to bond.. which is why it bonded to your tape better than to your plaster.  Good luck|`|94c2e1a976b337d761ad84ebb0a48658aa	I don't think anything is wrong. You should always remove the tape when the paint is not quite dry.  The only thing was the time you left the tape on.|`|67EYbk4xaa	Is it possible your kitchen paint was enamel based and if you did not use enamel primer, it would cause the latex paint to peel.  check the wall before whatever you put on first.  It's ok to put latex on top of latex, but not laex on top of enamel anything.|`|hEaybCQAaa	What kind of primer (and brand) did you use? I've found that Zinsser is better than Kilz.

AA10973140	I'm sorry.  I think you are s.o.l. as far as removing it.  Could you maybe use an iron-on patch cut to a shape like a heart or butterfly ?  Or maybe hot-glue some lace or something...
72ef78c3205dba97ba85c7ff5642145baa	The best idea is to have a door mat ot the entrance to the outdoor door they will be using and a floor rug, just inside the door to trap any other dirt coming in from getting too far into the house.  Maybe directional arrows taped to the walls directing to the nearest bathroom in the area you want them to be with RESTROOM printed on the arrows or paper.  Should make it easier to keep guests in the areas you want them in and if your Mum has the funds, a plastic runner set on any carpets they might be traveling over while visiting.  I had an Aunt who would break out the clear plastic runners whenever she had company or a showing on a house she was selling.  She said it did wonders keeping the carpets clean and her work load light.  Another hint, place garbage cans near the entrance to the door they will be using and throw a few extra bags into the bottom, that way, as you need to replace them, they are already there to be put right onto the can as you remove the full used ones.  <br>  As to games, there are lots of online sites for party games, best to check a few and find something that will appeal to your crowd and age group. For a party I had for New Years, I picked a party game that involved New Years Resolutions, a New Years word search game and some things about me that I didn't think anyone else might know, and the guests had to guess whose resolutions and things belonged to which person. It was a GREAT ice breaker and really got the party off to a great start, as people found out quickly who had simialar interests, and discovered other people they wanted to talk to some more after the games were finished and they now had an IN with that person!  Look for stuff that makes people get a LITTLE silly, without being too stupid, and stuff that will make even self conscious people play. Keep it light.  We also played a FEW drinking games for the adults, just to liven everyone up a LITTLE, and then it was simple to keep the liquor in check, so that no one got too drunk and ruined a nice time.  We didn't want them sopping drunk, but just a little tipsy to enjoy themselves and the party.  Everyone who drank, stayed the night.  We also made a game of keys in a basket when they came in.  Asking "Will you be drinking?  May I have your keys?"  And marked each person keys and the basket went bye bye after they had 3 drinks or more.  We had told EVERYONE attending who planned on drinking to plan of staying for a brunch to be served the following morning.  Now you may not have the room for that many people, but we did, so the next morning, we had a lovely brunch of pancakes, bacon, cereal, bagels and cream cheese, and mimosas (champagne and oj).  No one was in any hurry to leave either, so anyone wanting to return to bed, was offered more sleep time.  By 2 pm everyone was returned home safely and soundly!  It was a wonderful time, planned out with minimal effort and some forward thinking.  I also planned some of the food prep ahead, and some for as the party was gearing up, so some of my early bird friends could have some private time with me and help me gear up, prior to a full blown out party starting.  It was wonderful, filled with some great moments, lots of good times, and everyone was safe and had a great time!  Plan in such a way that you have time to spend with your guests, remember the point is to enjoy them, not just serve them and clean up after them.  If someone offers help, take it, don't feel bad about pressing someone to help a bit, not all, just step in for a minute here, lift this there, take this out to the picnic table and so on!  Don't feel you have to everything, its too exhausting if you ask me!  Good luck and I hope you have a lovely time!

8apA3Rffaa	4:1 ratio is the mix I ve used for over 20 years ..  I use 5 gallon buckets and mix in a big tub for this purpose. I also use Type I Portland Cement.The water  is about a 1/4 bucket but this varies with how wet/dry the sand is..  You ll want to mix up the sand / cement and then add water.  You DON T want it watery and soupy at all.. To much or a wet mix will cause to much shrinkage in this type of use.. You want it wet enough to pack a " snowball" w/o any water coming out.  Then you pack it down and screed it off level and to get your pre set pitch..  Any other questions  e mail me thru my avatar, check my qualifications and I ll have help and suggestions.. Add the shower base size and I ll give you quantities needed.. GL|`|bFOcQeDCaa	For a shower I would mix at 5 to 1. Five sand ,one cement.

One is the flapper is not closing or not adjusted right. Two is the fill valve is not closing or adjusted right. Or a combination of both. Kits are available at any mega store, hardware store, or plumbing supply store. Some styles are a little different, so look close at yours before you buy.

c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	Besides any store that sells garden supplies there is also mail order. I personally like Gurney's Seed and Nursery, Henry Field's, Nichols Garden Nursery and Jung's. Of course the shipping increases cost so if you are only buying a few kinds of seeds a seed rack at the garden center will be cheaper although a smaller selection of varieties. Many grocery stores will have seed racks about this time of year too.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	if you have a Farmer's Market nearby, someone there might have some to share.... or sell.... most of the time, places like feed stores carry the better types ....

It is less likely to burn your plants.Organic plant food granules is probably along those lines. Of course soil is a broad term for growing plants in, it would actually depend on what your soil has in it already. It is just a medium to hold the plant and nourich it's roots. If you have the necessary nutrients and moisture you are headed in the right direction.

34a008185ae3cdb2fe7e67d0b5a0a4aaaa	All you can do is melt it down in a different way.  You can buy a candle warmer from a craft store, usually like 5 bucks, and it looks like a coffee warmer kind of.  Place the candle on that and just melt it that way.  The melted wax will give off the same smell as when it was burning, and it will keep the wax longer, its not burning away with a flame.   If you wanted to maybe try to melt it down and then get a smaller jar, and try placing your own wick in it and re-making your candle you can probably do that, but you will need to go to a craft store and purchase the wick and the jar.  This is probably a way more technical method and a pain in the butt, rather than just using a warmer which will do the same thing.  And you wont burn away the rest of the wax with the warmer, versus the flame on a new wick.   Over time with the warmers, however, re heating the wax over and over will lose some of the fragrance .   Good luck!
1b5738a257bf0dcdcf42bd817a1e8692aa	Are your clothes getting warm?  Heating elements don't go bad gradually.  They work, or they don't, at all.  Could be a bad thermostat, but once again, that's not a gradual degradation.  More than likely, if it was gradual, your problem is in your air flow.  You did exactly right checking the filter and the air vent.  But there is more.  The dryer doesn't push air through, it pulls it through.  If you have a bad drum seal, or bad drum rollers, you could be sucking air from around the drum rather than through the heating elements.  Does your dryer seem noisy, this could be an indication of bad rollers or drum seal.  Another possibility is the blower fan.  It's made of nylon, perhaps over time the blades have worn so it is not operating as efficient as it once did.<br>  <br>  You cleaned out the vent hose going outside.  Is it secured on the back of the unit.  If the hose has fallen off the unit will re-breath the damp air which will seriously decrease its ability to dry.|`|N0TJqtzMaa	i doubt if its the element,would bank more on one of the thermostats,you can go to sears either on line or to a store and purchase a kit that has both thermostats and jumper wires and clips,if yours lasted for 15 years then you did good,most of them don't get past 5 years,the kit sells for around 25 bucks and is worth every penny,the reason they put both thermostats in the kit is because they are just like headlights in a car if you change one then change both cause if you don't one will be brighter and will burn out shortly after you install the new one and it saves you from having to open the dryer up twicealso check the vent hose and make sure its not getting clogged up this will slow down the drying process also.
00mE1I7Baa	It's possible that your house was skipped over by the fire, and yes, it's possible that the bottom floor was saved.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	The new systems come with a bypass valve. If yours didn't, then a bypass should have been installed using three gate valves or ball valves.<br>  Ball valves being by far the most reliable.<br>  By shutting the incoming and outgoing valves to the system, and opening the main valve, you would be bypassing the system and no water should be going to it.<br>  If yours came with a valve, it most likely is plastic and not very reliable.<br>  Water must be leaking in due to a bad seal.<br>  I would either install a bypass system using ball valves, or, if you don't plan on using the/a conditioner in the future, simply restore the pipe through without the tap for the system.

wKQbNvm9aa	A little sand is ok for the soil, especially if you are growing carrots or strawberries.  What clay soil needs most is more organic material, like compost and peat moss.  The more the better.   Mix it in as well as you can with a shovel - a tiller is easiest.   For a fertilizer, a slow release type is the best.  That is the kind with little pellets that provides you with nutrients for a good long time and doesn't overdo the nitrogen.   Add it around the plants when you put them in the ground.

UDoqWji4aa	If the building is fairly new, I would contact the builder and let him do it because this is not in compliance with building codes. The location of the detector is useless. Detectors are to be inside and outside of every bedroom, (hallways serve as a common area for multiple bedrooms), at least one on every floor without bedrooms. The general rule is about 5 feet outside the bedroom. Tops of stairs are also another good place since smoke rises. If the detector is hardwired moving it will be a problem. However it can be done. Hardwired means that it is connected to the wiring of the building and also connected to other detectors in the building.|`|83ef61786e290eb97d6c686cc7478c5caa	you can use the same tool that you use to replace light bulbs on a high ceiling, unless it is hardwired than you do not have many options, the best thing would be a multi purpose ladder go to depot or walmart you can a cheap one there and if you have high ceilings you will need again so don't think of it as a worthless investment|`|lDyEVzX2aa	call Treebeard|`|K4GiKOhPaa	Borrow one.<br>  <br>  Just out of curiosity, what good is a smoke detector at 16 feet?|`|N0TJqtzMaa	get the mom from the incredibles to do it for you|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Step 1: Find the correct battery.<br>  <br>  Step 2: Find a balloon.<br>  <br>  Step 3: Fill the balloon.<br>  <br>  Step 4: Find a midget.<br>  <br>  Step 5: Tie the midget to the balloon.<br>  <br>  Step 6: Give the battery to the midget.<br>  <br>  Step 7: Let go of the balloon, just below the detector.|`|db4310b357e8b8155cfe1bd956cf7660aa	Your local rental place will probably rent you a ladder to do the job.

If you have to clean it you gotta clean the whole thing. without more info can't really tell you how to clean the spot.

If you get a striped comforter, use floral or dotted draperies.  Lastly choose the fabric for the window seat;  you might be able to use a sheet from your set or even a pillowcase if the seat is small.

00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	If I'm seeing the picture correctly and where your arrow is pointing as to what fabric has torn away, it appears as though it's the fabric that's part of the zipper itself, which makes it useless.   There is no repair for this.  You're going to need to find a good seamstress or tailor that installs zippers and have them put  a new one in for you.|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	you need to cut the threads away and reattach the zipper to good fabric  if its all lost its strength then your SOL its time for a new one I don't believe there is another way But I hope I'm wrong.Good Luck
AA11564717	Smokey has given the best answer here.It is impossible for anyone here to give you an accurate idea of how much it will cost without  looking at the flange itself.If the floor is not rotted around the flange from water It would be a simple fix If the floor is damaged and the flange cannot be screwed down then it will be more costly.The flange may also be coming loose from the drain pipe.To just screw down the flange and change the wax ring should not take more than an hour.If there is damage to the floor[and there is a good chance of this]It could take several hours to a whole day.|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	If you pay a plumber about $150- 200|`|LqaQ5f5Vaa	toilet problems are not hard to fix, you can remove a toilet in 5 mins, dont let them chrge more than an hour, uk price ￡35-￡55 plus materials|`|FkPP6NVeaa	Do not ask plumbers. They will either give you inflated price, or tell you to call your local plumber. When you call the plumber he will tell you that he would not give you estimate over the phone, since he needs to see the problem first. Just to come and see the problem they usually charge you $50-70 (service call charge). They will waive this charge if you hire them for the job. Even if you find their estimate unfair you would probably go with that plumber since you have to pay that $50-70 anyway. This is the plumber way to push you into paying unreasonable prices. <br>  If you can not fix the problem yourself call several plumbers. When calling ask as many questions as possible. Ask their hourly charge, service call charge, estimate. Know exact price for the part you need replaced. Select most reasonable guy.<br>  Try to negotiate when he's at your house. Be prepared to be overcharged.|`|3uWCmNCsaa	It's a really easy job if you know what you are doing. I would go with an independent handyman instead of pro plumber.|`|3892a47ffe478c2cd83ade91886d7bf5aa	the only way to find out how much it WILL cost you is to contact plumbers in your area and ask for free estimates|`|36QJQXXyaa	IF this is the problem, an hour show up pay and an hour to repair. $150+<br>  If the toilet is wobbling it should be repaired asap as it will start leaking, leading to possible home damage.<br>  Small town / country shops usually charge less. City dwellers will pay for living in the city.<br>  Check craigslist, some tradesmen are out of work.
AA10051049	There are some things that might make it hard to start.<br>  <br>  1. Compression.  If the rings are worn and the compression is low it will be hard to start.  You have to check this with a compression tester and you will have to know the specs for that model.  Usually if when you pull the starter cord and you can feel definate "thumps" or hard spots the compession is adequate.  It the cord pulls rather smoothly you may have low compression.  The fix is rings and possibly a new cylinder.  <br>  <br>  2.  Weak spark.  you can check this by removing the sparkplug, reattching the wire and grounding the plug to the engine.  Pull the starter rope and watch the spark.  It should be crisp and blue.  If it appears weak and orange you could have a coil going bad or bad sparkplug wire or bad connections.  <br>  <br>  3.  Dirty air filter<br>  <br>  4. Dirty fuel filter.  The fuel filter in on the end of the supply hose inside the fuel tank.  Fish it out with a hooked piece of wire.  Clean or replace<br>  <br>  4.  Incorrect fuel/oil mixture.  Use recommended manufactor's ratio.<br>  <br>  5.  Dirty carburetor.  The carburetor can be cleaned and rebuilt for about $15.00.  You can get a rebuild kit from most any small engine repair shop.  You will need the brand and numbers from the carburetor.  Not a hard job. <br>  <br>  Most often on these small engines running and starting problems can be solved by rebuilding the carburetor...<br>  <br>  With a manual choke you can remove the air filter and watch the choke operate.  With the choke on, in the start position the plate should completly cover the carburetor intake opening or nearly.|`|3892a47ffe478c2cd83ade91886d7bf5aa	one more thing that it could be is a dirty air filter|`|9ZLl7nZcaa	If you have good spark then next check your gas is the filter clogged or is the gas line have a leak .If the C S is old then you might need to replace the gas line as they get brittle and crack letting air in and gas out . Hope this helps.|`|g3kP24kJaa	Sounds like its not choking properly. I have had trouble with engines that had the push button type primer. Also I was having the same trouble with a chain saw. I drained the gas out and got new gas, started right up so the gas maybe causing your problem
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I would have the floor and stairs the same color stain so it blends in together.<br>  But I would stain the spindles (if any) a different color, or even paint them to have some contrast.<br>  The rail I would have matching the flooring also.
