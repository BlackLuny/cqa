20090205163829AAHmAcn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What do you think about this (girls)?	Do you think that physical attractiveness really matters a lot in a relationship? Or do you think someone who knows how to act and say the right things is good? Im talking like if there was a rather unattractive guy but he knew what to say and do would you still have a realationship with him? From personal experince I find that good looks just help you get some attention but after that they really don't go very far. I have seen and know guys who lack good looks and can still have relationships with really attractive women. I just wanted to see what you girls and guys thought about this. Would you agree with me or not, explain why or why not please.

20090205164438AA6nlO9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Single divorced mother of one and pregnant with boyfriends baby ?	I am 37 and 7 weeks pregnant. Since finding out I'm pregnant my boyfriend and I have been fighting nonstop because he still goes out every weekend and hasn't found a job. He tells me he's making plans to move out, he lives in another state but it doesn't seem like he's going to follow through. He gets upset when I tell him I need someone to make me and the baby a priority but he gets mad and says he feels like I'm suffocating him and there's nothing wrong with him going out with friends. When I found out I was pregnant he promised he wouldn't leave me and would do anything to make it work and be a Dad but since then it seems as if he's getting cold feet as most of his friends tell him to be prepared to never go out again once you have a child. I told him today I need some space to think things through. I don't know if I should just break it off with him and not take his calls so I can start preparing myself or wait and see if he is a stand up guy..Any advice I would appreciate..

20090205164728AA4yPr0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm pregnant, but am I overreacting?	(This is going to be a little long, bear with me).      Ok so I'm 23 weeks pregnant on Monday, and I can't remember when I've ever been so frustrated in my whole entire life. My boyfriend and I have a house with his mom. My boyfriend is the only one who works, working 7 days a week. My job ended seasonal in December and needless to say, it is near impossible for me to find another one. His mom doesn't work, but goes to swap meets and tries selling stuff for money. Anyways, my boyfriend makes a little over $200 a week. Rent is $600, not including bills. My boyfriend pays half of rent, and gives her an additional $100 for bills. He also buys all the groceries. What frustrates me is that his mom seems to be sucking him completely dry of his money. Before we moved into this house, we all lived in an apartment. When we lived there, I was the only one working, but I was also expected to help keep the place tidy as well. When we lived there, she b*tched and moaned at my boyfriend at how he needs to get a job to not only support me, but to help her out with expenses as well. But she never, and doesn't even now, go out trying to find a damn job!!! So, now he has a job and we're living in this house. I thought things would get significantly better, but his mother is so lazy! Aside from paying her side of the rent and some bills, she doesn't do ANYTHING. She is also so wasteful and not resourceful in any way. She can go through a roll of toilet paper by herself in one day. She goes through a gallon of milk in less than a week because she uses a lot of it every morning when she makes oatmeal. She also can eat a whole loaf of bread in a day or two, eating several slices of toast a day. (Not to mention she also goes through butter and jam like nothing). Anyways, my frustration comes because even though she consumes and uses up all of these things, she hardly ever replaces them. And when we ask her to, she throws a fit and asks us why we're asking her to. The other day my bf asked her to buy more milk and toilet paper, but she threw a fit. She then automatically assumed that we were going to buy some when we went out last night (we went to add stuff on my registry for my baby girl). This morning she was upset because there wasn't any tp or milk.      She also doesn't lift a finger to clean. I am a stay-at-home-mommy-to-be, and although I feel very bad that my bf is the only one working, I do my bit by keeping the house very tidy, cleaning/cooking every day while he's at work. But I feel that if his mom makes a sginificantly big mess, she should clean it up. She always told me that if I make food, I need to wash the dishes I use, along with cleaning whatever countertop/stovetop I dirty. But when she makes food, she either leaves in the stove and if its not cleaned that night, the next morning she dumps everything in the sink before she leaves the house for me to clean. The other day she flooded the bathroom floor when she took a shower, leaving everything soaked, and didn't take the time to mop it up before she left so when I went to take a shower, I was pretty heated to find that I had to mop her mess up before I could.      She's also a gas guzzler. My boyfriend's car is great with gas, and while he's at work, she uses it. She usually drops him off so she can use the car while he's at work. Which is no problem, but she uses his car 95% of the time, and uses up all the gas, and then asks my boyfriend for gas money.      Omg I swear the list could go on, but I should probably stop before this turns into a book. I just don't know if I'm overreacting, or if she's really just lazy and a straight moocher!! She just doesn't take into consideration that she can't rely on my bf so much when we have a baby on the way and are trying to be resourceful as well as save money. We're trying to find our own apartment, but we're waiting til our friend gets a job because itd be way cheaper to share a 2 bdrm apartment for about $800 than have a 1bdrm for $500. What's your opinion?

20090205165417AACsMjQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	All mommies, I just wanted to share this story!?	I just wanted to share a story that happened today.   My dad called me and told me that he was going into town through the back roads(he rarely goes that way to town) and he noticed a 5 year old girl walking alongside the road and several cars had passed her by the time my dad had gotten up to her. He stopped and asked the little girl if she was lost and she said yes. He said it was 16 degrees out and she looked extremely cold and asked her to get into the car and he would help her find her home. My dad is a firefighter and took her to the nearest fire station and called the police. The police officer took the little girl and tried to find her parents. The police officer later called my dad to tell him that she made it home safely and to thank him for helping this little girl out.    I told him that I am glad he picked her up instead of some pedophile or a dangerous person and he said that he was just worried because if it had been one of his kids then he would have wanted a kind person to help them out too. He said that he didn't for one second think anything of it, he just wanted to help out the little girl. I am so proud of my dad for helping her and as a parent myself, I would have been so grateful for someone like my dad!      After hearing this, I have decided that when my daughter goes to school I am buying her one of those cell phones that can only call me, her dad, and 911!! I am overly paranoid about stuff like that!

20090205164702AAJzssY	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What are the car seat/booster seat laws in your state?	Someone asked the question about how long a child should be in a booster seat and it made me go and check out my own states car seat laws. I always went buy what friends and family said and have not checked them out since 2005. And just discovered in the state of Wisconsin a child needs to be in a car seat until age 4 and my 3 year old has been in a booster seat with a back since 3 1/2! He will not be 4 until this summer. Do you think i should take out his car seat with the harness again? He is going to be really mad if he has to go back into a normal as he calls it (baby seat) car seat. He fits fine in the high back booster it goes across his shoulder in the right place and he sits like a big boy in it because he knows if he doesn't sit like a big boy he will have to go back in the "baby seat" but I do not want to end up getting a fine! If I put him back in the car seat poor little guy is going to think hes getting punished. What is your opinion? Also look up your car seat laws and let me know what they are im interested and make sure that you know them! Thanks!

I've read on this site that a lot of babies can go up to a week without having a bowel movement. I'm worried though because my 3-month old has never gone more than 2 days and now she's on her 4th day. When she has finally gone poop, it doesn't ever appear that it was due to constipation because the stool is loose, not hard. I should also mention she"s exclusively breastfed. (I thought breastfed babies didn't have problems with constipation?)      In the last few days she's also gone from spitting up maybe 2-3 times a week to 2-3 times a day! This made me think that there's something going on with her digestive system.       I called the pediatrician and at first he wasn't concerned, telling me that I should wait up to 7 days for the bowel movement. While I had him on the phone though, she spit up for the 4th time in an hour. At that point he told me it would be ok to try a suppository.      I'm wondering if any of you have had this experience? Also, what was it like for you using the suppository?       Worried Mommy. :o(

20061010170412AA3l5P1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Why has my 18 month old stopped napping?	For the last 7 days, naptime has become a living hell.  Her naptime is 12:30ish, but sometimes she goes down later.  For the last week, she's gone down around 2 a few times, and I nurse her, and she's very groggy at the breast, and I put her in her bed (and this has always worked before--she nestles in and goes to sleep).  Then she screamed bloody-murder for 10/15 minutes and finally went to sleep.  Yesterday she went down at 12:30 and got up at one--never to nap again.  Today--same thing.  I let her cry for 1/2 hour today (more like angry sounds than needy sounds) and then got her up (I don't want her to feel deserted).  And just now I put her to bed (bedtime) and she pitched a fit.  This is not what's been going on.  I had a very easy sleeper until this last week.  Any ideas?  Please help.

20090203052251AAIEzL4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Changing baby's formula? ?	I'm calling my son's pediatrician when they open, but I wanted to ask others for their opinions and experiences.      We started my son on similac advanced that made him really fussy, gassy and spit up a lot, so we switched him to similac sensitive been on it about a week but he still gets really gassy but only every other night or so and the spitup still isn't going away.       So my question is should I try similac sensititive R.S with rice starch or maybe switch brands? I have 2 cans of Enfamil Lipil that a friend gave me and a $11 off coupon for Nestle good start. I was going to try to maybe exchange the enfamil for their lactose free version or get Nestle's version. Doctor already said to stay with the lactose free version, just wondering about what others experiences were with other brands. His spitup is almost after every feeding, he'll only go one or two feedings without spitting up. Thanks in advance:)      Oh and don't start on me about breastfeeding, been there done that for the first week of his life and just didn't work out that way!
20090203051603AAuaGwd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Asking again - Information on Cloth Diapering....?	Asked last night but didn't get a lot of answers so i'm posting it again....      I'm thinking of switching to cloth diapers but have several questions....      **I've heard it's still necessary to buy liners for them is this true?   **How absorbent are they?   **Are they convenient?   **Do you make your own or buy them?   **If you get the type with Velcro, do they all stick together in the wash?   **How long do they last before they need to be replaced?      Any and all other information would be greatly appreciated as well. I'm considering switching because I am tired of spending Upwards of $50/month on diapers.
20090203060817AAsPoli	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Self weaning vs cold turkey and other issues...?	My daughter's first birthday is coming up, and i'm all of a sudden feeling a lot of pressure (from myself and from others) to make a lot of changes in her life.  It almost feels like so much is supposed to happen so fast!      Sometimes I feel like I should just let her choose when she doesn't want the bottle/soother anymore.  People often tell me, she's just a baby, let her have it as long as she wants it, while others tell me she'll have it forever if I don't remove it now.        I have to:   *take away the soother   *take away the bottle   *get her off of formula and onto whole milk      and the list goes on (but those are the main ones).      Is it better just to switch her slowly, one at a time, or do it all at once and get it over with?  We have been giving her sippy cups for months, but she like anything in them EXCEPT her milk.  She will take two or three sips, and then throw the cup and cry - but if I put water or a little juice in the cup she will happily drink it.       How did you go about all the changes?  Did it seem like too much at once for you too?

20090203060343AAyvJKi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Tips on dealing with impossible four month old?	My baby is a whiner. She is not in pain, she's not having a problem, she just sits and complains and slowly winds into a yell and eventually a scream. All day, long. Every day. She's four months old so it's my fourth month of this. It's really starting to wear me down, I'm feeling very depressed. My husband is so frustrated. We have already decided not to have any more children because of what this one has done to our nerves, but I'm wondering if anyone has any advice on dealing with this? Thanks. And for Pete's sake don't tell me she has reflux or gas pains, she is fine per the pediatrician. lol... She's just cranky. Very, very, very , very cranky. crying right now as a matter of fact. Help.
20090203051402AAhA64S	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Question about diapers...kind of dumb...?	Ok so i buy Huggies night time diapers for my 15 month old to use at night. When i run out of them i use his regular diaper, Target brand, and another one on top of it. He stills pees through! I don't understand why the second diaper, on top, doesn't soak up the pee instead of the pee dripping straight out of the first diaper? I know it may be a dumb question but i still can't seem to find an explanation. Whether he wakes up for a feeding or not he still pees through and if i go to change him without him waking up first he'll wake up!

20090203053515AAaMXRv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Should a teacher be able to mandate how a child sits at their desk?	My daughter is in the 2nd grade.   Today she told me that she was sitting at her desk with her arms hanging down at her side. Her teacher came over and very forcefully grabbed her arms up and told her that she HAS to keep her arms on the desk.   Why? Is it that big of a deal? Shouldn't a child be able to sit at their desk in whatever fashion they choose (within reason of course)?   I'm not too happy about this teacher grabbing my daughter's arms either. She could have just told her to put her arms back on the desk.   Do you think this is enough to warrant a complaint? There have been numerous incidents that were similar so far this year as well.   I'd just like some advice from other parents.   Thanks!

20090203054708AAHSsd6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Having to many kids? someone help?	I understand the fundamentals of having to many kids and the pro's and con's about them. Some may argue though their religious beliefs allows them to have as many kids possible some people oppose the opposite and think that their insane.   We have many senario's in which the problem to bare children come as a problem.      One may be people having kids they can't afford and use government help that come out of tax payer's money. 2nd people who have kids and take care of them but don't treat them well. 3rd people who have kids but limited themselves to how many kids they want, because they find raising kids is hard,and last but not least 4 people who have more than 5 kids and keep having kids. they are taking care of them not living on any assistance and treat them very well. Then we have irresponsible parents who have kids and their kids wind up in foster homes.      My question is this, why do America, society bash couples who have more than 5 or 10 kids who take care of them and don't recieve any assistance as a bad thing. I fell that just because certain women feel as though 1 or 4 ids may be enough for them, that it should be enough for others. Of course kids are hard to raise and take care of but it is also a good thing to bare a gift that others can't. We have plenty of women who pay fertility clinics to have kids who can't have none on there on. For some reason people is beginning to think that after a certain of number of kids a cap should be put on.I do not think people should keep having kids that they cannot care for or take care of. I do think people need to stop bashing moms who have more than 5 or 10 kids and say that they are insane. Some religious do not believe in birth control and others think it is wrong to limited your womanly body to not bare children anymore all because of their selfish reasons.   not everyone wants to adopt other people kids, being pregnant and being able to witness a life you brought into this world that you carried for 9 months, is worth more than money and any aspect of your life. My and my husband planned on having as many kids as possible hopefully 20 or so. My grandmother had 15 and my mother had 10. no assitance but love.      Stop bashing moms who have plenty of kids. Just because you don't find yourself financially stable enough to care for many kids, doesn't mean other women have to stop who have the mean. Just because you find yourself not strong enough for plenty of kids, doesn't mean the strong ones have to stop. You do not have to be a doctor or lawyer or rich to raise a big household.      Also I will like to add that giving birth and adopting is two different things and for some people connection matters and the 9 months also does to. everyone believes in different things and my beliefs in if you can take care of them and raise them them have as many as you like.   I think in today's society people look at kids as a regular household bill than an actual person. More like another maintenance job rather than a human. Children are a beautiful thing and though they can be expensive they are only expensive how you make them to be. the world is to involved in money hungry people rather than loving comfortable homes and family. The luxuries and such, you only have one life to live, and it shouldn't be a race of who make the most money and who have the most stuff. Someone ask who in their right mind will want that many kids? people who have the patience, love, and financial stability would want that. not everyone is wrap up in their own personal lives. Adopting would not be an option for me , because I will want my own that I help make. That may seem selfish but for me it isn't because just because I want my own kids doesn't mean I'm selfish. Why would I adopt when I can have my own and take care of my own.

20061019175908AA7I3RV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Help Please??	I am almost 39 weeks pregnant. I am 1cm dilated, 100%effaced and soft. The baby's head has already dropped. I posted about feeling so sick earlier if it was a sign of labor but now I am starting to have like shooting pains when I try to pee or if I try and go poop.  It starts from my belly button and then goes down to my vagina area like he is coming out.  I am wondering if I am feeling this way because of a UTI or if those are stronger contractions. I didnt have like a tightening sensation in my stomach just the sharp pains.  Also last time I had a UTI like 7 weeks ago it said that I should take any medication after 38 weeks. So if it turns out to be a UTI would they induce me and do a c-section or just give me antibiotics and put me into labor?  I have an appointment tomorrow, I was just wondering till then. My contractions arent steady right now, just the pressure and pain when I try and use the bathroom or bend over.  So some advice would be great! Thanks!!!

My son was taken in on Friday because I knew he was sick with something other than a common cold--I waited the 3 days tried him on some tylenol but with a persistant fever for that 3 days I caved and took him to the family docs. Well turns out he had a pneumonia so I got the doc to check my daughter as well...she was fine but he said that pneumonia comes on the brink of a cold that was already present in that person and that we may have to keep and eye on Mya just to be sure she does not develope the pneumonia too...they both had the same virus.    Anyhow, I got Jaspers meds and on Sun morning Mya started with the fever and so I called to get her in and they did not have any appointments available...I took her to the walk-in clinic just yesterday and she was showing all the same symtoms as Jasper: weezing, cough,pain in stomach when she coughed, persistant fever, congestion    The doctor barely looked at her...checked her throat thats it and then said she had a respiratory infection--he gave me a prescription for amoxacillon and coldly sent me on my way. I was really upset cause I felt like he did not take the time so properly look at her...he barely spoke to us...would you get a second opinion?    I got her in to see *our doc this coming week but I was just wondering if this happened to anyone else...cause if there is something else wrong with her I might have to hurt somebody. lol   But seriously, my doctor did twice as many tests when we went there and this doctor was so tardy.. .just handing out prescriptions not actually examining. Geoff says I am overreacting and that I am not a doc so just relax but something tells me that this doctor was wrong...what would you do?    Thanks in advance.

20070301003655AAttlE0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Long pregnancy question?	Let's say a certain girl normally manifests all sorts of sickness symptoms and has irregular periods.  8 weeks after a sexual episode during which her bf pulled out, she has started having pregnancy symptoms (nausea, wt. gain, incr appetite).  She had 3 days of period like bleeding soon after the sex, and recently had bleeding that stopped after only 8 hours.  She took a clear blue digital hpt a few days ago, and it said "not pregnant" (8 weeks after sexual activity).  She took another one a few days later and it said "pregnant".  Out of 24 reviews on amazon.com for the clearblue digital, 8 of them complained of false positives.  What do you think?

Ok so I'm pretty sure I am pregnant even though I had a period it was way different than usual it was normal then light pink and then gone, I'm taking a test on the 7th the day before my birthday and I'm pretty sure I could be pregnant because my breast are going crazy on me, really really small mild nasea waves, more tired but I just want to no when ever you were pregnant did it feel like your breast would hurt more before bed than durring the day or did it feel the same all day and my last question is when your pregnant do you feel very tired like you've been running all day and your eye's burn like your tired but do you ever have troubles sleeping? I'm just curious because I am very happy I just want to no, I would take a test now but I rather have morning urine and tomarrow and the next day is my fiance's day off and I want to surprise him!!!
