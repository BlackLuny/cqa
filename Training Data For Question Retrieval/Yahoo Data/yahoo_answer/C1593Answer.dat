1Vih78dZaa	Your question implies that you don't live in a European Union country since you ask in English, but suggest you might move to England if Italy isn't possible.<br>  <br>  Conley39 has already given you good advice on what you need to do if you'd like to move to Italy. However, I think he did not emphasise enough that jobs in Italy are even more difficult to find these days than they have been, and it's never been easy in Italy to get a decently paid job without having excellent connections.<br>  <br>  As far as you moving to Britain as an alternative to Italy is concerned, you need to be aware that the employment situation there is not hugely better than it is in Italy, although you would at least have the advantage of speaking the language and so possibly being able to find something if you were diligent and resourceful. However, it is not possible for a non-EU citizen to get into the UK on a tourist visa and legally work. In fact, the conditions which non-EU citizens must meet in order to legally work in Britain are very similar to those applicable in Italy, although the British bureaucracy normally functions a bit more efficiently.<br>  <br>  The UK Home Office website I've linked to below has information on non-EU citizens working in Britain.|`|kgBPU4xxaa	You don't have to be fluent in Italian to move here, but it would help to know at least a bit of basic Italian and to learn the language while you're here. However, moving isn't all that easy if you're not an EU citizen. You'll need a visa that allows you to live here - <a href="http://www.esteri.it/visti/home_eng.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.esteri.it/visti/home_eng.asp</a> . If you're independently wealthy, you would need to demonstrate the means to support yourself here. If you need to work, it's even more difficult. Jobs are not widely available right now, and if you are not from the EU, you would need to have special skills or experience that can't be easily duplicated by someone from the EU in order to get a work permit. It is illegal for an Italian family to hire someone from outside the EU as an au pair, for example, since there are plenty of available people in that field who are EU citizens. Not knowing Italian would further limit any job opportunities.<br>  <br>  When I moved to Italy, I did so through a job that I already had. Even so, the paperwork to get a visa took about 8 months.

Corruption is well routed in India and no one is ready for a change here. All would wait for the others to change, but they wouldn't realize that the real change comes when one would change himself. When compared to India, foreign countries are providing better educational facilities and are following international standards in their universities.

When the Korean war commenced the decision was made in Washington to strengthen Japan as a bulwark against communism. Left wing Japanese people were very disappointed that the USA chose to put many of the same people who led Japan into the war back into power at that time.  In fact over 600 Japanese were executed as war criminals after the war. If it was the Commonwealth nations that were in charge of the occupation I'm sure they would have been much tougher. However Americans tend to be magnanimous in victory-that is your answer for better or worse.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Athough you said that the Japanese were not going to surrender so the only other option was a land invasion. <br>  <br>  It is just propaganda of the victorious nations. Actually during Jun to Jul in 1945, due to heavy airraid by US Air force, Japan had been no power to continue to war anyway. They lost aircrafts, battle ships and oils and provisions. No allied countries any more. Don't distort anything.<br>  <br>  The atmic bombs were thrown just because Russia wanted to invade to Hokkaido soon as German had surrendered and USA wanted to stop Russia going down to Japan immediately.<br>  <br>  In addition, Japan paid compensation for the war reparations to Asian 4 countries. China (Republic of China those days) made a peace treaty in 1952 and renounced its rightto claim that time.<br>  <br>  P.R. China and Korea were not existing in WWⅡthat country have no right to claim. <br>  <br>  Although you are too sensitive to the killing numbers of Chinese civilian by Japanese army, not only China but also Russia and Polish are almost close but no reliable datas has not been recorded. These are all guessing. Some Chinese civilians might be killed by Chinese army, not by Japanese army. Only God knows.<br>  <br>  War crime can't compare with each other. All of those are just evenly horrible, no more or less in degree. Comparison doesn't make any sense. Why do you complain? What is your intention? I smell stink somewhat.<br>  <br>  Korean War took more than one milion sacrifices to death in the civilians. Chinese civil war also invited more than one milion's civilian death. Anyway, the number of casualtiies more ore less is meaningless to talk about peace and war because it depends on population density.<br>  <br>  Australia was once one of notirous white shupreme principle country those days. I don't know if it compensated to local aboliginis and many coloured people once they lived in there. <br>  <br>  So many innocent people have been still killed in all over the world even now. It is sad that we call it war. It is not playing soccer or clicket by combats. Soldiers are not peaceful policemen but just coward killers sometimes.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Your facts are WAY off,pal. The Germans killed far more people than the Japanese. And as far as bombing Hiroshima and Nagasaki, you're wrong about that too. By that time Japan was in shambles.They were running out of money and supplies.The American government had already fire bombed half the country.Japan wanted to throw in the towel without "losing face".But we wouldn't let them.Losing face was very important to the emperor.Russia had their own troops massed and ready to invade Japan.And the Nazis were close to having their own A-bomb.You're also wrong about German POW camps.People were treated like animals,and worse.So what was your question?This "question" should be removed as "ranting".What you've been taught was one-sided.|`|5ZtSR0IQaa	It seems like you aren't trolling, so I think you deserve an answer.<br>  <br>  If you are versed in the history of WWII, you should know that there was a San Francisco Peace Treaty signed by 49 nations that officially ended WWII, formally ended Japan's position as an imperial power, and allocated compensation to Allied civilians and former POWs. On the basis of the San Fransisco Treaty, Japan paid up all war reparations, and it's a closed affair.<br>  <br>  The PRC Chinese government continually inflates their WWII casualty figure and is an unreliable accuser. If you want to bring up Nanking, the supposed casualty there exceeds the estimated population of the city back then, so it's like seeing an automobile accident plaintiff in court.<br>  <br>  The US military received all the research results from Unit 731. Unit 731 also made sure that none of the research results went to Soviet hands. The US secretly granted immunity to Unit 731 for this, and no one in Unit 731 was a defendant in the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal.<br>  <br>  If there were a 2% mortality rate in German POW camps, there's an upwards of 1 million German soldiers in American POW camps that are still unaccounted for today. If a good part of them perished by American maltreatment of them, the victor of the war really did write history in their favor and got away with it.<br>  <br>  I will grant you one thing, though. Japanese memory of WWII does focus on Southeast Asia and the Pacific. That's where all the expensive navy ships went to and where all the zeros got deployed. It was where the relatively liberal navy was. The Chinese continent was the playground of the brutal army, whose contempt for a civilian government isn't remembered fondly even today.<br>  <br>  So there was there Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal where individuals were indicted for (A) crimes against peace, (B) conventional war crimes, or (C) crimes against humanity. Class C, crimes against humanity, included mistreatment of POWs and abuse of civilians. One thousand defendants were convicted and executed for Class B and Class C. Many of them were never allowed to see their family or even leave a note between their arrest and execution. This would be the kind of state-sponsored disappearance that a totalitarian regime could only imitate, and it was done by the occupying Allies (mostly US).<br>  <br>  Tit-for-tat, there seems to be plenty that America would be happy to sweep under the rug too to appear like a clean victor. But point-for-point, everything that Japan did in WWII was addressed and spoken for between the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal and the San Francisco Peace Treaty. The Allies (US) pretty much decided that Japan had paid up per the terms of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, and that is closure.<br>  <br>  Now, there are WWII Axis powers that really got away with murder. I would cite Austria and Finland.<br>  <br>  But I think you and I well know why the US was quick to put Japan back on its feet. The US wanted a strong ally in the Cold War, right next door to the Soviet Union and China.<br>  <br>  I do think you're more unhappy that the Japanese don't act guilt-ridden and apologetic when you bring up the subject. The piece of national psyche that WWII's given to Japan comes in the form of a strong distaste for military action and a distrust of military authority. Have you tried probing that side of the equation?|`|OTnSwNwZaa	I agree with Billy to an extent. The past is the past. We cannot change it. All that a party can do is apologize and learn from the past. We only have the present, and hopefully, the future.<br>  <br>  Now, I have asked the same question (despite coming off as anti-japanese, I'm really not, but facts are facts). I believe that it's because there are many jews that are in the media and own many media outlets. If the Chinese owned media outlets, then we'd probably hear more about the japanese atrocities.<br>  <br>  In WW2, almost all of the countries did horrible things. British and Americans firebombed Dresden, we all know about Hiroshima, Italians in Ethiopia, Russians raping in Germany, etc. Also, many soldiers were just following orders and fighting for their country that they believed in; not for the joy of killing.|`|d2f1c9545ed4c110bb4a655ee098e488aa	I'm not exactly sure what you mean by "get away with it". Japan is criticized ALL THE TIME for not properly making amends with China and Korea. <br>  <br>  People object to the dropping of the atomic bomb not simply because they lack knowledge about the "real situation". Many people are simply against atomic warfare and warfare as a whole. Furthermore, unlike Pearl Harbor, which was a military target, the target of an atomic bomb is an entire CITY. That's massive destruction in a such a short span of time and certainly the bomb doesn't distinguish between military and civilian. Although it's true that women were being trained to defend the homeland with bamboo, a mainland invasion would still have consisted of AIR bombings.<br>  <br>  Whether or not more lives would have been lost and which side would have lost those lives is negligible when looking at the motives behind it, because that's NOT why the bomb was dropped. The dropping of the bomb has more to do with the Soviet Union than it does with Japanese agression. Dropping the atomic bomb allowed America to end the war on its own terms, thereby giving it control of the direction that post-war Japan would take. It also marked the beginning of the Cold War, showing the Soviet Union that America was not a nation to be messed around with. <br>  <br>  Whether or not Japan has "paid up" definitely depends on where you look. China, Korea, and other Asian nations were barred from the talks ending the war, so the demands America made did NOT consider how the Chinese, etc. would feel and what they might wish for Japan to do. As far as the official demands, Japan DID pay, but it's definitely fair to say that Japan has not done its part in reconciling with its neighbors. Yes, had East Asia been allowed representatives in the talks determining how it would pay, we may not even have any of these issues today.<br>  <br>  Australia suffered quite a lot during WWII at the hands of the Japanese (this is MUCH less known in the world than the attrocities committed in Asia), and I know many of Australia's elderly still hate the Japanese, so it's a sore subject... The problem with Japan's education regarding WWII can be summed up in two things (in my opinion):<br>  1. Due to the length of Japanese history, some schools do not even reach modern times in their history classes. This I heard from some Japanese themselves who stated they didn't study modern Japanese history. Without ANY study, one must do research on his/her own, which schoolkids tend not to do...<br>  2. Because the atomic bomb was such a horrific affair, and because it's affects are SO long-lasting and ever-present among those exposed to the bomb, Japan DOES tend to focus more on its role as a victim in the war rather than as an aggressor. Had Berlin been bombed with an atomic bomb, I DO think they would harbor "victim" feelings alongside the memories of agression.  No matter how bad the attrocities committed by Japan were or the horrific nature of the Holocaust, atomic bombs are meant to affect the civilians, and I don't think it would be difficult to sympathize with German civilians if it had been Berlin that was bombed, even with the Holocaust. Saying that the atomic bomb is horrific and tragic is NOT saying that everything else is okay. Things like the Holocaust, Nanjing Massacre, AND the atomic bomb droppings all involved massive death over a brief period of time. I think it's difficult and not helpful to rank massive suffering to say that one was more or less horrific than another.<br>  <br>  I agree that the lack of teaching about Japan's role as an agressor is a PROBLEM that the Japanese education system needs to do more to correct, but there are some interesting things to think about:<br>  1. America doesn't teach its students about the affect of the atomic bomb, despite being the ONLY nation to use it in warfare. Don't you think it's important for students to learn exactly what a bomb does? WWII is depicted in America as the time when America saved the world. It's glorious. Believe me, there are no American attrocities listed in WWII. Such things would kind of rain on the parade.<br>  2. Peace Osaka is an interesting museum in Osaka that's permanent exhibit DOES include videos, pictures, and information about Japanese agression in Asia and the some of the attrocities committed by the Japanese. I'm not sure how many other countries have a museum like this, outlining the BAD things done by the nation. If there is a museum highlighting American attrocities in America, I'd be interested to know where it is and what exactly it features. I've never heard of such a thing.<br>  3. Do you think Chinese textbooks are accurate? South Korean textbooks? (Do I even have to mention North Korea?) Chinese textbooks are NOT well known for accurate accounts of history, particularly modern history.<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to DEFEND Japan, because I believe that Japan truly is NOT doing the best it can to address these issues. I just thought I'd point out a few things. You seem quite passionate about this, but hopefully you can see that the issue on the Japanese side is not as simple as you assume. The situation is quite sad, really, because I think the young generations in China seem to WANT to forgive (there is a lot of intrigue about Japan), but the stubbornness of BOTH governments perpetuate distrust and ill feelings on both sides...<br>  <br>  (as a sidenote: There is a growing number of Chinese and Korean youth who *partially* think like Billy: "The past is the past, let's worry about the future". While it can be apathetic, it can also be hopeful and inspiring. I guess it depends on who it comes from.)|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Japanese are not teaching their youth everything because they have too much shame. Pretty soon, Japanese kids won't even know there was a WWII. <br>  <br>  It doesn't matter, because not all Americans even knew what was going on.  Japan is secluded and they have their ways to be discrete on certain things.<br>  <br>  The past is the past and the Japanese have their pride.  Do you hear an apology for Pearl Harbor? No. So what makes you think they'll apologize to the Chinese?|`|1scwV5bJaa	past is past, u can't make someone bow down and say sorry if they don't want to|`|AA11231409	You ask a lot in one go, but do you really think they got away with anything? They have already paid the money that America agreed was suitable, they can't keep paying forever whenever someone suddenly claims they need more compensation because their own government didn't distribute the compensation to those who deserved it. It is actually a fact that Japan paid compensation, whether you like it or not.<br>  <br>  I don't know where you got your info about POW camps in Germany, but it obviously wasn't from the same source as the Brits got their info. From what I learned they were most definitely starving as well as being used as slave labour, and many were certainly tortured. 2% chance of death? You must be joking.<br>  <br>  >Japan killed more civilians than the Germans did in the holocaust yet you never hear about it.<br>  Again you must be joking. We never stop hearing about how many zillions of civilians the Japanese slaughtered during WWII, and the numbers seem to increase on a rabbit-like scale. I don't hear about the ones the Germans killed very often these days though, maybe because I'm in Japan and don't watch Brit war documentaries.<br>  <br>  >where as Germany are fully aware and apologetic about what happened.<br>  Are they? How can you be so sure? Even Britain has been exposed for mistreating POWs for example, within the last couple of years, yet for so long we were all taught how pure and wonderful our side was. We obviously weren't very well aware of the truth, yet our government claimed we knew everything. Reminds me of the behaviour of certain English speaking nations now, not Australia of course though. But If you think Germans know all of their country's past, how can you be sure? What makes you think you know? Do you have access to all the deep and dark places filled with top secret files? And if you think they're all apologetic you obviously walked around Germany with your eyes and ears shut. There are many nazis there now, and sometimes they get media attention by incinerating immigrants.<br>  <br>  You might know about the American educational failures, and I'm beginning to learn about the Australian educational failures from you, if you sincerely believe that Japan wasn't trying to surrender. It's called propaganda, and you've been taught it as fact. We were taught it too, but schools all over the world are hotbeds of propaganda. Not just in Japan. <br>  <br>  Why are you so surprised that the Japanese people were told to fear the enemy and resist to the death? Surely it's normal for all civilians (and the gun-fodder) to be told that in a war? Off the top of my head I can't think of a time when it was any different. The enemy are always reputed to be inhuman psychopaths with a lust for blood and young virgins. And look at the 'weapons that can be deployed in 45 minutes' lie, but it worked on Americans and the British government.<br>  <br>  Are you sure that you're not actually pissed because Japan whales in waters your government wants to claim?|`|BvwJOIkiaa	People who win wars are the one that write history. In my high school history book the bombing of Hiroshima by America was a paragraph or less in my textbook. Later that year, I visited Hiroshima myself and saw people's shadows permanently cast into buildings and heard horror stories of people having their flesh melt and get stuck to their clothing, eventually leading to their death. Did you ever learn about that in school? Americans don't learn about what they did to the japanese just as the japanese don't fully acknowledge what they've done to the Chinese. <br>  <br>  It is wrong, I agree with you, but I think we should be just as apologetic about using the atomic bomb on them.<br>  <br>  P.S. Many POW in Germany, especially, the Russians, got sent to workcamps to be worked to death or gassed and were treated no better than the Jews. I'm not sure what POW camps you're talking about but they did not treat all POWs well.<br>  <br>  PSS. It is true that the government was encouraging an insane and fanatical behavior, but the atomic bomb was awful and had truly terrible consequences. The japanese were running out of raw materials to make weapons and they would have been forced to surrender eventually. We (I'm American) also attacked a city, not a military base, with innocent civilians.<br>  <br>  Then why not drop other bombs? The A-bomb was, at its core, a show of power. It was done to show off our military strength and knowledge to the rest of the world, Russia especially. I don't believe it was just done to "end the war."<br>  <br>  And yes, I would have objected to a German city getting bombed that had women and children in it. I don't buy in to the whole "Germany is evil" BS. I've read "The Rape of Nanking," which was a real eye-opener on how more brutal the japanese were.<br>  <br>  BTW, I had to lol at your school system comment. Yes, our schools are pretty bad.  XD  I'm in college now, so I get a more in-debth understanding of history...|`|RxddnLkEaa	G'Day, firstly, the number of casualties differ, so do the wartime practices - depending on the books you read, It's all controversial, depending on the perspective. In a world war it is very difficult to get exact facts on everything due to the scale of events. We can only assume from what we read and hear.<br>  <br>  To be technically and politically correct I will only say there was mass killings during WW2. Figures are not that important. What is important today is what we do from now. What do you think will improve from a simple apology that you seek to gain? <br>  <br>  Japan has turned around since the war and currently only hold "self defence military force", they do not initiate in any warfare, they have one of the safest countries in the world, and have made significant contributions towards world economy, world peace and world poverty. <br>  <br>  I believe these actions talk louder than any apology by a government personnel.<br>  <br>  Take a look in your own backyard today, Aussie battler. Whaling is the controversial topic on the news, today. Why don't you stop taking stabs at history you cannot change, and put that effort into making a difference today to create a better tomorrow for the next generation, mate.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|uPr9hjVDaa	So what do you want us to do? bend on my knees and apologize? my grandparents didn't even go to the war. I know what Japanese did back then was horrible. But what can you do about it? It's been over 60 years since that happened. I don't think money will cover all that up but Japanese helped China and Korea by paying a lot of money to fix the city. When there was huge earth quack, Japanese was the one who helped them. I'm not saying because of that, Japan will be forgiven, but what I'm saying is that it's better off to move on rather than keep talking about past and hating. Somehow many Australian people have problem with Japan. I've seen many Australians who are talking like you. Talking about WW2, and other stuff. It's like leave us alone already. ps. you said Germany have paid up and Japan have not, but what do you mean? so If German paid up, that means you can forgive them? I seriously think that you have something against Japan. Don't need to deny it to make yourself look good.|`|zopegiT4aa	Probably the Japanese have more to offer the world economically so we don't make them have consequences. Chinese don't whine and complain about it, we just make more babies to make up for the loss. Get over it, it's the past.<br>  <br>  (By the way, I highly doubt any country teaches an an accurate history about itself, look at America)<br>  <br>  I still say get over it. Anyways it's not your fight to fight. My grandma was running away from Japanese and found bullet holes in her clothes later and she's moved on.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd spend your energy on bettering the present and helping the homeless, parentless children, etc.|`|a68c06235aa533ea99418e01783a0282aa	the roman catholic church tortured and massacred thousands of people, yet today millions still slavishly devote themselves to the pope. <br>  Hundreds of Europeans were massacred by the chinese during the boxer rebellion. Is china offering compensation to their descendants?<br>  <br>  A curious anecdote- Many german soldiers were sent to Canadian pow camps during the second world war. During the long train ride from the east coast, the Germans initially refused to eat their box lunches.  The guards finally found out that the prisoners thought the first box lunch was their food ration for the entire week and that they were saving it. They couldn't believe that they would get three meals a day.|`|lWtazRzZaa	I think you got your numbers wrong. I think it's supposed to be 100-300 thousand. Million is just too many.<br>   I don't know if it's possible to prove how many were killed. I heard that the population of Nanjing didn't reach that number. Bodies of such a massive number haven't been discovered. I really don't know about it. It could be chinese propaganda, I don't know. It is written as a fact in textbooks in japan but some people seriously deny it.<br>   About 731, they don't teach that in school. The Japanese government got away with that because they had a deal with the US. Which states "the US gets the medical data that was achieved during the tests, and the leaders and doctors of unit 731 walks away with no record"<br>   <br>   But still the US killed 800,000 with just 2 bombs. I still struggle to see that as a necessity to end the war.|`|qNG2jxfVaa	I don't know how they have gotten away with it but you know what is more shocking is that during the Unit 731, Americans helped them cover up from procecution by trading the sources on human experimentation. (youtube.com). Anyways I agree that the past is the past, however unlike Germans, Japanese are rewriting their history and educating the new generations that they have no fault. I believe that if they can't make things any better....at least don't lie or deny about your past history. In addition,  as of this day Japanese are claiming (so called their territory) from Russia, Korea, and Tawain....does this action show that they are truely sorry about the past? They still haven't apoligize to some other asian countries about the sex slave.

5ZtSR0IQaa	Subtle color manicures are all right for funerals, so nail polish should be fine. Remember that you will be going up to offer incense in front of everyone, so bright colors that draw excessive attention would be inappropriate.<br>  <br>  There's no requirement to put on pearl earrings. Technically, the only appropriate accessory for a funeral is a wedding ring. Pearls are just considered permissible. A single necklace is fine. A double necklace is absolutely impermissible.<br>  <br>  Technically speaking, you should bring a juzu that correctly represents your own Buddhist sect or the sect of the deceased. If you aren't Buddhist, there wouldn't be one that's perfectly right, but bringing your own would be a good sign of respect for the deceased. If you're buying one, you can get the smaller lady's juzu. It doesn't have to be an expensive one. In fact, an expensive juzu would be a strange thing to have for either a non-Buddhist or a devout one. A proper juzu should have 108 beads. It was originally so you can count your chants and change exactly 108 times. If you're familiar with other religions, you might find something similar there.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	Wear black suit and act modest.

Or you may barrow somebody else there.

Also, a some blonde and green and blue eyes, indians, black, and mostly everything.<br>  Colombians have a vast and varied population. There are a LOT of mixes, from every kind of cultures, looks, etc.<br>  As for the personal side, Colombians are VERY friendly, kind, nice, helpful, etc.<br>  I don't deny that there are exceptions like everywhere, but most of the people are like that.<br>  LOVE to party and dance, know how to have a great time, have a big variety of food, BEAUTIFUL scenery.<br>  If i told you all of the great things of Colombia it would take me days to finish. :D|`|f6a42ef1b57ba4b191c4db4cc48534edaa	They are mostly friendly?<br>  <br>  Actually there is such a mix that I would have a hard time "categorizing" them. It really depends on the area they are from maybe.<br>  <br>  A lot have dark hair and brown eyes but I have seen a lot with blue or green eyes and lighter complexions.|`|EyOzAeyraa	Brown eyes and brown hair which is a dominant gene, usually resembled as BB, or Bb.

ThKkn5fKaa	It's hard to say.  Heron Hill is part of the Hill District, which is one of the worst parts of town.  That being said, Heron Hill, part of the upper hill, seems to be fairly safe in contrast with the lower and middle hill.  Still though, you'll be fairly close to one of the very few unsavory parts of town.  Here check out this map.  <br>  <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09046/946399-85.stm?cmpid=relatedarticle" rel="nofollow">http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09046/946...</a><br>  This is from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette website.  It is a map of all of the recorded homicides in the Pittsburgh region last year.  You'll notice that Heron Hill is completely clear, but just fifteen blocks SW, there are some rather unsavory places.  The vast majority of the major crimes are relegated to the Hill, and the Homewood/Brushton area, while the other parts of town remain fairly safe.  <br>  <br>  If you are unsure about it, there are other places where you could find safe, affordable, and nearby housing.  I'd recommend Squirrel Hill, Shady Side, Bloomfield, Lawrenceville, or the Edgewood/Swissvale area.  You can find affordable housing in all of those areas, but more importantly, they are fairly safe neighborhoods.|`|Wy0lUjP9aa	No no no. I used to live by Heron Hill. I wouldn't live there. Or Homewood, Wilkinsburg. Basically those little areas around Pitt is bad. You are better off trying a suburb. One that is close to the highways. Say like Swissvale or Edgewood or Squirrel Hill(I know they are rich neighborhoods but you can find cheap apartments there) something like that. Sorry I cannot remember suburbs names. I haven't lived in Pitt for 2 years. I basically was raised there. I now live in Missouri. I miss Pitt so much.

fv2GAAdPaa	Well my dear i guess if it was that easy from the beginning it would have already been done, there must be a depper reason or problem for all of the happenings now...<br>  <br>  I hope it all gets better.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	You don't know sh*t about Haiti OR the way they conduct elections on that hell hole of an island, do you?  All you know are the BUZZ WORDS.. because YOU HAVE NEVER SET FOOT on Haiti... especially during election time... which is a REAL CRAZY SEASON... any foreigner on the island knows to stay out of sight on Election Week-end.. for their own safety.
cEuuj70Eaa	First off, Disney Land is California.  Orlando has Disney World.  BIG Difference!  Second off, there are a lot of great things to do in that area.  I am not understanding if you are staying on Disney property or just outside Main Gates.  On Disney property, all the hotels are connected by buses.  But outside off the property, you can take the shuttles to Disney but there may be a charge to go elsewhere.  You will want to ask at check in what is available.<br>  Disney has a great place called Downtown Disney or Disney Marketplace or some of us remember it being called Lake Buena Vista.  It is a collection of wonderful shops to explore.  There are kid theme stuff all over.  Once in a while characters walk around.  You may want to bring or rent a stroller.  Def rent one in the parks.  That way if someone takes it you can get a replacement for free.  You will have your hands full with that tiny baby.  <br>  Buy a very good strong sunscreen.  And make sure you cover exposed places including the ears and scalp.  I have seen some really lobster baked kids at Disney.<br>  Bealls Outlet Mall is located off International Drive in Orlando.  There are many other wonderful places to go visit, many with kid themes.  I like Bealls because they have a Disney AND Universal outlet store.  (Cheap souveniors!!)<br>  For your five year old you may want to invest in a special kinda autograph book.  Make sure it is easy to carry but large enough for the Disney Characters to see when signing.  <br>  When we hit the theme parks, we carry hip bags.  I also carry ziplock bags for the phones wallets and anything else I do not want wet from rain.<br>  I have to warn you Disney tickets food and everything else is very expensive.  Be prepared to spend spend spend.<br>  In all the theme parks they have a baby area where you can settle back breast feed and change baby in comfort.  It is a nice fairly quiet clean area.  Disney is also wonderful if you lose a kid.  <br>  There are locker areas in the front of the theme parks incase you do not want to carry tons of things in with you (I would make a large diaper bag or back pack with a change of clothes for the kids, sunscreen etc...nothing of value and leave it in the locker and carry a basic diaper bag with must haves like diapers and wipes and baby bottles etc.)<br>  Best place to get those autographs I spoke of earlier is when you first enter Epcot there is a Character signing area.  If you get there early and get in line first...you can get Mickey Minnie Chip and Dale Goofy Donald and a few others.  Back near the United Kingdom is the Pooh area at Epcot.<br>  The hotel you stay at in the lobby should have TONS of free brochures of what to do and see.  Very worth investigating while you are there.<br>  <br>  Have fun good luck and if you have anymore questions feel free to email me.  Blissy<3  Florida Native|`|0WASp0bHaa	Go to DownTown Disney during the week. It doesn't cost to get in and your 5 year old would love it. <br>  get your disney park tickets from the disney web site only!
tPPZ0QDmaa	The average cop in Jamaica makes around $7200US a year.  Some of them are corrupt and make more in less than savory ways, but the majority of them are honest.  <br>  <br>  Its unfortunate that they make so little, considering the height of the criminal element there.  But that's what happens in a developing country such as Jamaica.|`|oTuMMYJoaa	A patrolman makes $100 to $125 a week, if they are honest. Most supplement their income by holding roadside checkpoints, where they can shake down the locals, or take kickbacks from dealers (especially in Negril). I have a few Jamaican friends that have been caught with some "herbal remedies", and it ended up costing them about $150 US, $100 of which the officer actually came to his house to collect!|`|2eaaded8e03b973ab9791c78223b0d6daa	It depends on the postion the cop holds it is kind of hard to answer just so.They are several different ranks.Try finding out what quad he works for and what rank he holds<br>  <br>  Some Example you have:<br>  <br>  constable<br>  corporal<br>  Sgt<br>  Inspector<br>  superintendent( Deputy,Senior)<br>  Commissioner(Assistant,Senior,Deputy)|`|KNi7gCMpaa	The average cop with 5 years on the force makes J$30,000 a month....that WAS US$500, but the dollar has gone up, so its not the 500 it was. <br>  <br>  PURELY was right, lots of cops do other stuff to make ALOT more than their pay, but he was WRONG when he said most were honest !
zOyWCvqtaa	I'm not a cyclist so can't answer the question as readily as a cyclist can but to give a starting idea.  It takes about 30min via freeway to drive that trip.  <br>  <br>  The best way to go, and safest, is via the M7 motorway which will link you between Miller via Liverpool and Blacktown.<br>  <br>  A couple of websites to get you started:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bicyclensw.org.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bicyclensw.org.au/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.liverpool.nsw.gov.au/LCC/INTERNET/me.get?site.sectionshow&PAGE1628" rel="nofollow">http://www.liverpool.nsw.gov.au/LCC/INTE...</a><br>  <br>  This is the NSW governing body of roads and road law:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/bicycle/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/usingroads/bic...</a><br>  <br>  The links on the right of the above website, will give some information in regard to road rules for bicycle users.

If you've lived together for at least 12 months and can prove it, you could sponsor her for a spouse visa. The process shouldn't be too difficult if you've been together for 3 years. You don't need to marry now or at any time in the future - 'spouse' applies to both married and de facto partners. Spouse visas are temporary for 2 years then become permanent if you are still in the relationship at that time.<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets/1127.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/allforms/booklets...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/migrants/family/visa-options.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/migrants/family/v...</a><br>  <br>  While she's waiting for the spouse visa, she could come on a 12 month Work and Holiday visa (they are usually granted within a couple of weeks). Be aware that if she applies offshore, she must be offshore when the spouse visa is granted, so timing is important.<br>  <a href="http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-holiday/" rel="nofollow">http://www.immi.gov.au/visitors/working-...</a><br>  <br>  2. You/she can find an employer to sponsor her on a Subclass 457 - Business (Long Stay) visa – Standard Business Sponsorship for 2 years.

FI55Pm9Vaa	I agree with you. The objective of displaying such is to project their punctuality on screen and like what you said, giving an extra & important service to commuters who needs to rush around the Isle using their transport service.<br>  <br>  I expect them to display in the accuracy of plus-minus 1min (max) like in London and in many big western cities.<br>  <br>  It'll defeat the purpose if the display is inaccurate at all! However I'm really used to Spore's "pattern".  We always have "things" for the sake of having it (that's all!), so that we can "boast" about it (the "service"). Therefore it is not a genuine service provided to the commuters.|`|dQdYUFVBaa	Awww dont take it too hard Artoro :] Even the best has its flaws once in a blue moon.<br>  <br>  Singapore's transport is one of the best I've experienced. <br>  There are many horrendous transport systems around which are a torture for tourists (especially the ones in Europe). Singapore's fine and dandy|`|6i53RN5jaa	If you've read today's newspaper, SMRT's fined peanuts. |`|J2KAe3jbaa	their  service  is  bad|`|koCBtfSNaa	You see wrongly.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	Yes, I have seen it many times while I take SMRT buses. I think anything doesn't have 100% prefect as there are always flaws in anything. This is depending on how you look at it. I seen this kind of info and the like in HK, Taipei and US respectively and I think Singapore is doing quite a good job already. So just get use to it and be fine. |`|AtMcUdK9aa	they r very bad
y0llJ0Avaa	The answer is simple my friend. You did not answer the question by stating welcome back (btw what was the question?).<br>  <br>  There are most certainly cliques located here, one in particular is somewhat top heavy with some very shady characters. The type that you would not take home to meet your mother.<br>  <br>  Chin up old boy, don't let them get you down.<br>  <br>  add<br>  It matters not if your question or answer is innocent once the piranahs have their teeth in you it's 'goodnight Irene'|`|7ONAv4vYaa	WB?<br>  <br>  Just think of it.. "too ignorant".. People come to Y!A because they don't know of something and want an answer to it.<br>  <br>  I think you forget the meaning of Y!A. People are suppose to ask and answer.<br>  <br>  Perhaps the questioner didn't like your answer? Just think of it.|`|T6v3RWixaa	I have seen your WB answer, it is so harmless, but maybe somebody<br>  thought it meant something else.  I have also seen that others greeted<br>  her like you did and got thumbs up.  I am beginning to think that YAP<br>  is no longer a real exchange of knowledge site, but more of a private<br>  exchange site of the so called elite group.<br>  <br>  Edit: Are you going to this YAPper's meet on March 9 ? (That<br>  question was deleted, did you notice ?)|`|z5fFoTMBaa	If it's any consolation, you're still alive and YAPing. A barrage of violations made me lose my first TC. It has happened many times that I have called the attention of Y Answers. If it will screw my account, so be it.<br>  <br>  You seem to be correct that there is an "elite" group here. Just calling them that makes me laugh, them bunch of loonies.<br>  <br>  According to the guidelines, there has to be more than one "reliable" members complaining for a content to be removed. By that, it probably means those who hold TC badges. I mean to say that if a content, no matter its message, is not complained to Y Anwers, then it's most likely going to stay. If they got their eyes fixed on anyone, there's no escape.|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	I don't have the details of what the question was or what you answered.  Perhaps, it was how you responded to it...WB (welcome back) which isn't really an answer.  Well, don't take the report too hard.  I, too, have my fair share of violation notices but I didn't allow them to dampen my spirits.  I can understand how you are feeling right now.  I have experienced the same let-down feeling the first time I received a violation notice.  After a time, I got used to it.  As most would say, "kapal muks nalang" (thick-faced). LOL<br>  <br>  Some people really are obnoxious and petty.  Look at how many thumbs down I get for my answers.  And take the thought away from your mind regarding not being a member of any group.  That has nothing to do with it.|`|c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	It maybe deemed by Yahoo as chatting or did not answer the question.  I cannot see anything abusive there.<br>  <br>  You answered WB.  That's my initial. (WindBlown) - maybe they thought you were calling me.  That's chatting.  :)<br>  <br>  For me, it has nothing to do with any groups.  There will be happenings (deletion/suspension) like that but leave it to Yahoo to decide.  This community is getting bettter and better now.|`|c790c0f3ca4b5ca33ae20dba3a6be536aa	Maybe, your answer is violating the guidelines.  Anyway, I also had my share of experiences they put a thumbs down on my answers even if they are sensible ones.  Not only me, but I noticed with some answers having a thumbs down.  Not fair.|`|JU6nmKHaaa	not abusive at all but can be considered as not answering the question.  maybe you are a minority and not close to the leaders/managers.<br>  <br>  try reaching out to the leaders/managers or their friends and you can be untouchable.  example:  as some or one always bragged, we have an advocate here in yap.  you can have your deleted q's/a's or suspended account resurrected.  i just do not know if it is fair to all <lahat> the members of the community or how the members perceived it or was it within yahoo guidelines (advocate made some investigations).  will it apply to all the members also (asking the help of the advocate/manager)|`|AtjlmByAaa	Hi, personally I don't consider this Q&A as a knowledge competition, I joined here coz I believe I will learn a lot from it, it has everything under the sun topics so to speak.  Regarding your complaint, guess you have a point under that circumstance.  Reporting an "abuse answer" of someone else' to Y!A has to have a really ghastly and awful content in it. As long as it is not offensive to conventional standards of decency especially by being sexually explicit or disgusting and morally offensive, it's just fine.  Everybody are entitled to practice their freedom of expressions.|`|GtEAGuweaa	LOLZ! sorry for that pare, di lang kasi ikaw ang nadadali "nila" ,well, actually this is my second account, my first account was a decent and sensible one, in fact, i was a TC in other category, but some lowlife scums in this category too did the same.sumagot ako ng maayos, and fortunately gathered some TU, dunno if they were envious about it or ayaw talaga ako mag best answer, anyway, my point is sana ayusin na lang nila sistema dito, di naman nila ikakayaman to eh.Good Luck tol! Good Luck na rin sa lahat!|`|huRS5ml8aa	I think it may be possible that the reporter gets a "high" from reporting innocent Q and A's such as yours. Probably it thinks that being at top reporter makes it a "somebody" but it really is a sad nobody.|`|MLwhrBjgaa	Is that what you called "crab mentality?"<br>  Ganun din ako eh, ilang beses na.|`|tUPXslOMaa	I admit that I USED Y!A in so many wrong ways like chatting, quarreling etc. but I have learned my lesson in a very hard and unforgettable way.  Now, after what I've been through, I'm only here just to ask and answer questions to the best of my ability and I make sure that I don't make any wrong move that would make someone report my mistake even though it's not a mistake at all.  I only use Y!A if there's a question hanging on my mind and I will never use it again to gain connections, friends or whatever.  After all, I can consult the people around me who I can really depend on when I'm in need.  So before you do something that you think might get you reported, think twice or else someone out there will hunt you down.|`|wqP8ACpBaa	I have asked that same question, over one year ago. And many before & after me as well. And still, your guess is as good is mine.<br>  <br>  Although let me offer a few guesses of my own.<br>  <br>  It does look like it is a violation & I can see that many have offered the terms you violated already.<br>  <br>  But the reasons behind the reporting may be one of two things.<br>  <br>  1. Somebody who is out to rid YA of violators have reported your answer. And of course at least another person reported it as well. Now either those are two different people or one person with two or more accounts, who knows.<br>  <br>  2. You have offended somebody & now he or she is after you.<br>  <br>  Anyways, whatever the reasons are, you just have to learn from this experience like the rest of us. I for one have many many violations & three suspensions. One which have been reversed. Continue answering the best you can & next time be mindful if your content is reportable or not. Read the entire terms & guidelines & lastly do not mind those reporters.|`|uvGkdOqNaa	i have no ideal to tell u the truth|`|3ebea5843f9fbfc762e23242cd727e4caa	If your answer was ONLY "W/B" as you state than your violation would have been presumably either chatting or not answering the question.<br>  There are some elite groups here but belonging to one is no guarantee that you wont receive a violation. Some are known to do dastardly deeds to their own members under the cloak of secrecy.<br>  It is always best to first answer the question as best as you can then in the source box enter your W/B message or any other message.<br>  Don't answer questions with:<br>  idk (i don't know),<br>  lol,<br>  thanks for the 2 points, etc as all these are violations and do get reported constantly also always answer using English or, if you use Tagalog, supply a translation.<br>  Hope this was of some help.

nwsgLAN5aa	I looked all these stats up on legitimate sites so no, I'm not making this up:<br>  <br>  -Your chances of being involved in an aircraft accident are about 1 in 11 million<br>  -Media coverage would suggest that airline crashes happen every day. Studies have shown one would have to fly once a day every day for over 15,000 years in order to statistically be involved in an aircraft accident!<br>  <br>  Whenever I fly, I just think... out of the thousands and thousands of flights taking off every day around the world, what are the odds that THIS one will crash, let alone any?<br>  And just think... since there has been an unfortunate crash just last week, the airlines are going to be all the more cautious about everything.  Just like after 9/11.. security increased.  Airline crash... maybe doubling up on the maintenance checks.  Know what I mean?|`|3OeE8kMQaa	You have a higher chance of wining the lotto than being in a plane crash, which means it's about as probable as being hit by lightening.

Just be optimistic...........|`|AA11496012	Flying is extremely safe even though there have been a few crashes recently.  Just know that the crew is highly trained and will do whatever they can to get you to your destination safely.  Remember that airplane crashes make the news because they are so rare.  The last fatal airplane crash in the US happened about 2 years ago.  Thousands of flights take-off and land without incident.  If the news listed every car accident that happened today, it would take an extremely long time to report.<br>  <br>  Australia is a really fun place to go.  If you don't get on the plane, you will miss a great vacation.  Bring some calming music or good book to read to get your mind off of things.  Also on the flight to Australia, there will be movies that you can watch.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	"All the recent crashes"?  Crashes are no more common now than they have ever been.  Air travel is the safest it has ever been.<br>  <br>  You can feel more at ease if you stop watching television news.  The news media try to scare you deliberately, because they know that people who are scared will watch more and more news in search of reassurance.  The real world isn't nearly as dangerous or in such bad shape as the news media portray it.<br>  <br>  Without the depressing influence of the news, you'll soon feel much better.<br>  <br>  Remember, the news only reports accidents, it doesn't report flights that arrive safely.  And it prefers to report plane accidents, because those scare people a lot more than car or bus accidents (even though the latter are thousands and thousands of times more common).

First they go to the Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo area for some beach hiking.   Ixtapa/Zihuatanejo is sorta touristy, but not the way they did it, staying at Angela's hostel.  Then they went of to Uruapan in the state of Michoacan to hike the Eduardo Ruiz National Park.

Mayahual get a little crazy when a cruise ship pulls in, but the Maya Beach Garden is far enough away that it's not affected. And not many tourists come down the Yucatan coast to Mayahual.<br>  Option number three:<br>  If you want to see a lot of Maya ruins, fly into Cancun and rent a car and circle the Yucatan peninsula.

WvAlIncZaa	During the day would be pretty hard.  The Ethi's usually sleep pretty much all day because they hang in the clubs all night and then when they close at about 2am, they head to the coffee shop until about 6.  Your best bet is to just wait until the evening and head to a coffee shop at one of the hotels.  There's Semi Rami which is right at the mouth of Exhibition road as you are heading north away from the Grand Mosque and you turn left into Gudabiyah, it's on your right, at the beginning of Exhibition road.  Also a lot of Ethi's in clubs in Juffair like Rock Bottom, Wrangler's and some others.

And getting admission is tough for non-residents, because the resident students get first picks, and if there are any spots left over, these spots usually go to the most highest academic achievers.

You can get to know different cultures and the city is pretty much a tourist heaven. There are the most beautiful places you can go, each with a rich historical background. Robben island is a must see, just so you will know and see for yourself, how far South Africans has come, the struggle all South African went through and the debt of impact Nelson Mandela made. <br>  <br>  Walking on table mountain is another adventure. Reach the top by idear cable cart or climb. The  mountain can be climbed from Plattekloof gorge or thought the Botanic gardens.  Visit the Simons town for even more history and see the life of a fisherman. The waterfront is a wonderful experience with dancer, music and lots and lots of shops.<br>  <br>  There is a variety of wine routes that you can follow. Tasting wines, cheese and getting the feel of the wine farms as well as the people. Many farms allows you to picnic, take a horse ride, drink at a small little coffee shop or just relax and dine in the tranquillity of the wine lands.<br>  <br>  The two oceans aquarium also gives you the opportunity to view our great abundance of see life.

AA10353250	The Allbrook Mall in Panama City is a two dollar taxi ride from El Cangrejo and most hotels.<br>  <br>  It is the largest mall in the country. It has two levels and is adjacent to the Panama bus terminal.  You can go by bus for .25 cents. The buses are old American School buses, gaily painted and called Diablo Rojo.<br>  <br>  There are dozens and dozens of shops in the mall. There are the (recognizable to Panama) usual department stores and specialty shops. There are three food courts, the largest with a Merry go round and a model train that goes on a track above your head. <br>  <br>  There is a Cinema complex with several movies playing at the same time.  <br>  <br>  There might be some USA known shops but I don't remember any. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of USA franchise restaurants like McDonald's, Burger King, KFC, Pizza Hut. <br>  <br>  There are shops and department stores that offer just about every price point, from the lowest at places like Dorian's and Costco to mid price like Stephen's and Conway (Target) and the more upscale too.<br>  <br>  This is the main mall where the middle class shops. There are a lot of shopping malls in Panama. The upscale one is Multi-Plaza. The other<br>  mid price one is Multi-Centro. The cheaper one is on Avenida Central the Pedestrian Mall known as Peatonal. That is fun just to walk<br>  around it.  Sorry, I can't post pictures here. But you can Google images and find some.<br>  <br>  <br>

Da Courmayeur poi prendi l'autobus per Chamonix, i biglietti si prendono all'ufficio informazioni nel piazzale Monte Bianco, so che è un po' caro perché devi attraversare il traforo del Monte Bianco.

It does get much quieter at night on that part of Phaholyothin and the location of the Bangkok Patio down Soi 3 should be quiet enough, and very quiet at night.

This is true not just at the Mainland, but also in HK and Macao in the recent years, as well as Singapore and Malaysia too. Taiwanese singers suits more towards mainstream POP taste while Mainland China ones are more off-mainstream. That's why the Chinese from mainland cannot make it big outside China, which incl. Taiwan. Its also because of the censorship as its very strict in Mainland China while Taiwanese one are more relaxed. <br>  <br>  As for the actors, why? cause they are cheaper !!! And because actors need to act long hours, not many Taiwanese nowadays can stand that hardship for long, so they rather be singer, dancer or even host and not much for actors.

Budget: Take the airport express bus either AE3 to Central World stop and take a taxi to Novotel Siam Square(NSS) or take AE 4 to Mah Boon Khrom stop and take a taxi.  Estimated cost 150 baht for bus plus Taxi 60-100 baht depending on traffic, total could cost 210-250 baht.<br>  Medium: Metered taxi to NSS 250 to 1000 baht depending on traffic<br>  Expensive: Take a sedan to NSS, 600 to 1000 baht.<br>  2. NSS to Grand Palace, depending on traffic, a Taxi is best 60 to 120 baht.  <br>  3. NSS to Pratunam Plaza, I am guessing for shopping, 60 to 100 baht depending on traffic or you could walk.  About a Km  or so north of Central World Plaza<br>  4. NSS to Suan Lum Market, take the Skytrain near Central World, take the Silom Line to Saladaeng Station and walk to Lumpini Park.  Or you can talk a long walk.

It should cost about 300-350 baht or so inc. 50 baht airport surcharge and tollway fees.<br>  To the Grand Palace, a taxi is the easiest.<br>  #3, walk or taxi, it's only about a kilometer or so to Pratunam from the Novotel.<br>  #4 You can take the Skytrain from the Siam station on the On Nut line to the Asok station and transfer to the MRT (subway) Sukhumvit station, go to the Lumphini station very near Suan Lum.

The Skytrain and the Subway are great to avoid traffic, use them when you can, they don't go everywhere though, taxis do. Forget the buses unless you know the routes or can speak Thai.

Use the search function and you will get many hits on taxis from airports or tuk-tuks. <br>  <br>  When you need a taxi in Bangkok go out to the street and wave a moving taxi over, tell the driver meter only - when he agrees hop in.  The fare covers everyone you can stuff in safely.  Don't over tip the driver.  Have small bills for paying taxi drivers and for cheap purchases.<br>  <br>  Avoid taxi cabs parked out side hotels, especially expensive hotels.  They will want to bargain the price of the fare and you will pay more!  <br>  <br>  The Skytrain is an excellent way of getting around town.

Something may be "bloody marvellous" or "bloody awful".

Make sure you sign up for a frequent flier account.  When you arrive at the airport, go to the American Airlines ticket counter.  You should be able to check all the way to Melbourne so you should be able to get your boarding pass for the first leg of the trip any other leg and the LA to Melbourne segment.  That way you do not have to check-in again at Los Angeles.  Your luggage should check all the way to Melbourne so you do not need to pick up your luggage and then check them in again.

b7XMyK9naa	Unfortunately, there is no cure for rheumatic disease (with the exception of infectious arthritis, which can be cured with antibiotics if detected or diagnosed early). The goal of treatment is to limit pain and inflammation, while ensuring optimal joint function. Each treatment plan designed by a physician should be specifically tailored to the patients type of rheumatic disease, as well as the severity of the disease. Treatment plans often involve both short-term and long-term relief approaches, including the following:<br>  <br>  Short-term relief:<br>  Medications<br>  Short-term relief for pain and inflammation may include pain relievers such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Ask your child's physician for more information before giving a medication to a child.<br>  <br>  <br>  Heat and cold<br>  Whether to use hot or cold applications on affected joints depends on the type of arthritis present and the recommendation of your physician. Pain relief may be obtained temporarily by using moist heat (warm bath or shower) or dry heat (heating pad) on the joint. Pain relief may also be obtained by placing an ice pack wrapped in a towel on the joint. Cold applications help reduce swelling, as well. However, people who have poor circulation should not use ice packs. Consult your physician regarding the type of application and application time before use.<br>  <br>  <br>  Joint immobilization<br>  The use of a splint or brace can help a joint rest and protect it from further injury. Walking devices, such as canes, crutches, and assistive devices with extra large or longer handles help keep stress off certain joints.<br>  <br>  <br>  Massage<br>  The light stroking and/or kneading of painful muscles may increase blood flow and bring warmth to the muscle.<br>  <br>  Long-term relief:<br>  Medications<br>  There are several types of medications that may be used long-term to reduce pain and symptoms, including the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications<br>  These medications, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, help to reduce pain and inflammation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Disease-modifying anti-rheumatic medications<br>  These prescription medications may affect the course of the disease, by slowing down its progress and influence, and/or by correcting immune system abnormalities that are linked to the disease. Examples of disease-modifying anti-rheumatic medications include methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, penicillamine, and gold injections.<br>  <br>  <br>  Corticosteroids<br>  Corticosteroids are medications that contain hormones to treat rheumatic diseases. These medications, such as prednisone, can be taken orally or as an injection.<br>  <br>  <br>  Weight reduction<br>  Extra weight puts more stress on weight-bearing joints, such as the hips and knees. Weight loss in overweight people has shown to reduce the chance of developing certain types of rheumatic disease, including osteoarthritis.<br>  <br>  <br>  Exercise<br>  Certain exercises, such as swimming, walking, low-impact aerobic exercise, and range-of-motion exercises, may help reduce joint pain and stiffness. Stretching exercises may be helpful in keeping the joints flexible.<br>  <br>  <br>  Surgery<br>  In severe cases of rheumatic disease, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace a joint. There are two main types of surgery for arthritis and other rheumatic diseases, including the following:<br>  <br>  <br>  repair - surgery to repair a damaged joint may include removing debris in the joint, fusing bones, or correcting a bone deformity.<br>  <br>  <br>  replace - if a joint is too damaged for repair, it may need to be replaced with an artificial joint.<br>  |`|6i53RN5jaa	To prevent rheumatism from acting up, avoid having soy bean products.|`|238ac5605fbeaaa3bb6e9e1c648285d4aa	This 71-year-old Chinese man goes by "Electric Man" to his friends and neighbors. Why? Because he routinely has 220V of electricity flowing through his body for "exercise." While he's charged up, he can do a number of things, such as light lightbulbs and cook a fish in a mere two minutes. He also uses his powers to treat locals for such diseases as rheumatism, arthritis and lumbago, which confirms my wish to never be treated at a rural Chinese hospital for anything, ever. ? [Spulch]

PxwTDDGkaa	Hong Kong has the 14th price level in the world. Singapore is not in top 50.|`|7a09f0a1575a6fb3adae34957ca25a7caa	So you live in China close to Hong Kong and am considering going to Singapore for my Christmas shopping unless it is more expensive than Hong Kong.for general clothes, electronics & gifts. For my advice, go to Hong Kong unless you want to for cultural stuff, like Sarong, Kabaya, Peranakan items as Singapore is cheaper, but for other things go to Hong Kong as Hong Kong is nearer to China, therefor you save transport fee, Only if you can get items that get you back your tax thru applying at tax refund, or else, Hong Kong is the best bet as it a free harbor and still 0% VAT or GST for Singapore only. My relative come here to Singapore not for the shopping but for the cultural itself. So thats what I mean and rest are up to you my China friend. |`|hS9sazGsaa	Of course Singapore is less expensive than Hong Kong. Hong Kong merchandise is pricey especially the brand name items.|`|zzwEOQcHaa	Going to Singapore is a waste of time, especially considering the price of airfares. Being in Hong Kong for a month every year, I know it's a shopping haven. This is especially made true by the no sales tax. Depending on what electronic you're getting, it is probably cheaper in Hong Kong. If you're looking for cellphones, Hong Kong has several cheap places like one near Mong Kok, but look out for some that don't have warranties. Nearly everywhere has electronics actually, just don't go to some large stores (like Fortress which is a ripoff), and try to find some trustworthy stores. Also try to argue the price down a little. For clothes, don't buy it at the shopping malls, try buying it from smaller stores, but watch out for fakes. All clothes and other items such as jewelry are cheaper then in China, since China has luxury tax on those items. Also, watch out for fakes. Just try to look for trustworthy independent stores, and keep away from large department stores, and you can find bargains.|`|6i53RN5jaa	If you're hoping to get bargains for your Christmas shopping, Singapore is certainly not a place to do so. Most low to mid-priced fashion apparels are manufactured and imported from the Mainland.

So it's a no go.|`|V8TgiY4Caa	Prices are about the same as Hong Kong.

These system aren't practical however, and both the homelands and the reservations suffer from the same problems, including poverty and very low economic development, and just being a money drain on South Africa/America in general because neither the homelands nor most of the reservations can sustain themselves economically. After apartheid the South African government decided to integrate these homelands and their people back into South African society. In my opinion they should probably try to do they same thing in the USA.|`|hJLHnGWBaa	why should we do home work for you?

They all have high crime rates IMO.This may upset you or scare you, whatever, but I live in Sydney & a great percentage of crimes committed here are by people from your region, so you won't be escaping from them, many of them live here.But having said that, I find most people from NZ & the S.Pacific Islands are very pleasant people.|`|uG8yLnUWaa	I can assure you that this is not "the norm" here in perth!! We do have out fair share of crime but it seems to come in little waves. EG a couple of years ago we had a real run on one punch deaths, and then we haven't had one for ages. We are no different to any other place. Many people do assume coz we are just "little old Perth" that it will be all quiet and lovely with no violence or crime, there is nowhere like that in the world. <br>  <br>  Come on over, keep away from trouble and for the most part it will keep away from you.|`|58UB5lqRaa	no matter where you go these things happen its just unfortunate that this has happened all at once here. i have heard N Z is bad for crime<br>  but i imagine its the same in any country, just keep your self out of harms way from people that are not nice and you wont have any problems|`|k6M48eUMaa	Unfortuantely, things like this happen everywhere.<br>  All you can do is try to keep safe, by locking windows and doors and never travelling alone (especially at night).<br>  <br>  Stay safe!<br>  ?|`|JoVrAhAVaa	best you should go|`|FSsdAWRnaa	Things like this happen everywhere.

Manuwera is typically not too flash but we lived in Wattle Downs which was lovely.|`|f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Beach Haven.  Mixed.  There's the awful state house area & then there's the million plus homes on the cliffs in Coastal Beach Haven & then there's middle of the road middle class Beach Haven where I live.  This used to be a holiday hotspot way back when, before Auckland was populated very much so you can still get the occasional 2 bedroom bach or cottage around the place which is nice (expensive to buy due to the nostalgia factor).  Also famous NZ jazz musician (lives in London now but comes back here every summer to do gigs - has one at Auckland Zoo with Hollie Smith tomorrow night) Nathan Haines was born & brought up here & I think his Dad still lives round the corner.  There are a few nice little beaches around & a great park in the next suburb in Chatswood called Centennial Park - loads of tui's & fantails, kauri tree's, a beach at Kendalls Bay & at low tide if you walk round the rocks on the left hand side of the beach, you get an awesome view of the city skyline.  4 large supermarkets near the area & easy to get to the city via bus due to the buslane on Onewa Rd & offpeak driving to the city is cool too. <br>  <br>  Not ideally where I'd like to live in Auckland, but I wanted to own a property & this is all I could afford.

I was in Portugal last month but i just stayed mostly in Lisbon.  My husband is from Benfica but his parents are from Algarve like 2 hrs drive from Lisbon , never been there but they had been talking a lot about how awesome that resort place is. Portugal preserve most of their historical places castles and palaces ( still with the original furniture ) i was amazed.  Shopping for brands is amazingly cheaper than i ever thought ( Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Burberry and Prada ) but food is a littlebit pricey for me. The people are friendly, most of them speaks english, the place is beautiful if your concept of beautiful is none medieval  but if you're up to a modern city i can say it look tired  less progressive. Streets are narrow ( it was prepared only for horses and a carriages way back then) except the highways coz it's mostly built during the late 80's.  Your choice of month is fine,  I was there January and ended up walking in the rain for the whole 2 weeks (no kidding).

b1b911398e5752977033f736afe9e07caa	That's a great time to go whale watching!<br>  <br>  In the Monterey Bay area you'll see the northern migration of the Pacific Gray Whales. The mothers are returning with their calves, which are still nursing.<br>  <br>  You also have a pretty decent chance of seeing Humpback Whales, which are moving into the area to feed for the summer as well as transient Killer Whales which prey on the Gray Whale calves and other smaller marine mammals (like seals and sea lions). <br>  <br>  There are also lots of dolphins in the area. <br>  <br>  The weather can be great and can be not-so-great, it's really hard to know more than a few days in advance. Prepare for the worst and dress in many layers. Even if it's fifty degrees out on the water, it can be cloudy and/or damp. I usually wear a turtleneck, then a wool sweater, then a jacket and sometimes a windbreaker over that if it's wet. If I get too warm, I take off a layer. (Bring sunscreen too!) If you get seasickness, be sure to take any medications about 2 hours before boarding the boat, and if you're feeling queasy stick to the back of the boat, outside if possible. <br>  <br>  Here's a great website where you can see the logs of everything sighted each day over the years (and how often trips are canceled for bad weather). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.montereybaywhalewatch.com/sightings/slst0804.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.montereybaywhalewatch.com/sig...</a>
lys5kB9Daa	you live in an area that has one when you learn to speak. your parents and teachers have that accent, so when they are teaching you words they teach you how to say them like they say them- with the accent.  if you are an adult and you move somewhere with a different accent i dont think you ever really pick it up because you are too used to speaking the way you were taught. my parents moved from mass down south and they still speak 100% like bostonians because its how they've talked for 50 years.
6vrFy7U7aa	Hello! I sat fourth row (slightly off center) once to see Phantom (however, it was in London...but no matter...fourth row is fourth row!) I loved it! i didn't have to crane my neck as some might imagine and I was able to see the happenings of the entire stage..and this was from fourth row, so, personally, I do not think 5th row would be too close, as long as you're not too far off to one side so that you can take in the entire stage...and...from 5th row I think you will find that when a certain something happens to the chandelier during the show...it will be MOST intense!

zOyWCvqtaa	Sadly in australia the socialised health system does not cover dentistry.  Though there is a very small public dentistry service for those on welfare benefits, and usually just in an emergency as opposed to a general check up and cleaning, and braces.<br>  <br>  You have good timing for asking this question as a more broad approach to public dentistry has been brought up of late.  In fact access and participation in the current system is very low due to various reasons including, limited centres and very long queues.  At the moment our current government wants to have this cover all persons within Australia, basically under our current public medicine system.  The main objections to this are it would cost too much to run this program.  Therefore the compromise the opponents to this system are willing to negotiate are to broaden the program but place income based limits on the free service.  For example low incomes earners can access the service.  The other argument against the much wider service is that our Medicare levy would increase to cover the cost.  Medicare is the name of our public health provider/system, and in our taxes we pay a levy to cover this system.  Therefore to increase the provision of the current service would require an increase in taxes, socially australians in general are against this idea.  In fact our taxes are some of the lowest in the world (our highest income earners pay no more than 48% income tax), especially since we are a true welfare state.  In fact since australia is more or less an institutionalised welfare state our taxes are extremely low, and culturally we are quit unwilling to pay more tax for any reason really.  Conversely, an all encompassing system that takes care of everything for you, such as in Norway, pay up to 70% income tax.<br>  <br>  In saying all this dentistry is important to the average population with the old message of visit the dentist twice a year and brush your teeth twice a day e.t.c.  But dentistry is an often over looked part of our health care system, especially by various governments regardless of ideology.|`|6ENZ3D9Oaa	well i go to dentist annually and private healthcare covers that<br>  generally people go annually but i know some people who have never been before, like their parents just never felt the need for them to go etc, not cos they cant afford it<br>  our public health system is really good but it does not cover dental (our system's alot better than the US one)<br>  and i'd say like more than 90% of the kids i know have or had or are getting braces, i'm just about the only kid i know who hasnt had any because i dont need them<br>  but i dunno if that's a good representation because I go to private school so there arent really kids who cant afford braces<br>  and some have them when they're 12

It is forbidden because that is the same as stealing something that belongs to someone else.<br>  <br>  Lovers have been known to bolt their religious affiliations to consummate their loves. To these lovers, religion can not forbid them from loving each other. <br>  <br>  Those with confused gender have an equal right to love, and society has corrected the biases against them, such that some states even allow them to marry, to the consternation of moralists. To them, being both of the same gender does not forbid their love.|`|sa8dElLZaa	I believe the only reason when love is forbidden is when the object of your love is already married.  <br>  <br>  Other than what I just said, it's just you.|`|eB8tYK1Gaa	Love can be forbidden.

Never selfish, never inward-oriented. Ever willing and ready to sacrifice for the sake of the beloved. Ever gentle. Ever faithful. Always trusts.<br>  <br>  True love doesn't seek so much to be loved as to love; to be understood as to understand; to receive as to give.<br>  <br>  Only selfish "love" is evil, destructive, demanding.

eD7qRBKHaa	Depends on the day you are going, because hotel prices vary by time of year.  Disney's Value resorts are the cheapest on-property, and there are four of them - All-Star Music, Movies, and Sports, and Pop Century.  They all cost the same, except Movies also has some family suites.  So let's assume you are going to get a standard room at one of these hotels - the most expensive time all year is during Christmas, where it is $145 a night.  The cheapest time of year it goes down to $82 a night.  So see this chart to see how much it will be on your dates: <a href="http://allears.net/acc/faq_asmv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://allears.net/acc/faq_asmv.htm</a><br>  <br>  Sounds like you will be going for 3 days/2 nights.  So you can get a room for $300 at the most.<br>  <br>  Then tickets.  You will need 2 days of tickets.  If you buy the cheapest ticket, just a 2-day base ticket, it will cost $158.69 (includes tax).  Your friends will need three days of tickets, which will cost $225.78.  <br>  <br>  So then you just have to budget for getting there - fly or drive?  Disney does provide free transport from the airport and around their property, so if you fly, you won't have to rent a car.|`|14c690b99c03a819fd4f7cbcd14bac5eaa	Well, if you go on your birthday, you'll only have to get tickets for your friends since they are offering free admission on your birthday....<br>  <br>  As far as hotels and all of that, the best thing to do would be to call a travel agent, or call the Disneyland reservation line and have them quote you a cost.|`|J05AvuuXaa	thats more than enough

I just wanted to tell you that the median American income is WAY higher than $26,000 a year, the average American Income is about $36,00-41,000 a year. You probably looked at out GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and assumed that that was our median income.<br>  <br>  Also, I think the Colonists and African governments are responsible for its poverty. The governments for not providing enough stability for its people. Every nation needs stability or it won't receive any foreign investment. No foreign investment equals no jobs. No jobs equal poverty. African countries are some of the most corrupt countries on the planet. Also, the Colonists because they randomly divided up Africa to meet the European's needs and ignored traditional tribal boundaries, much of todays warfare in Africa is based off of Territorial disputes.(I just had to answer that question)|`|kELDXjkgaa	AGE: 30+<br>  <br>  SEX: F<br>  <br>  POLITICAL AFFLICTION: INDEPENDENT<br>  <br>  What are five words or terms that come to mind when you think about Africa?

eDjiOWKtaa	congratulations! however... i don't think all of those med board exam passers will instantly be junior residents at the hospital of their choice. sad to say, but it's just like any other industry. some hospitals would require their would-be resident doctors to buy hospital bonds, other hospitals need a recommendation from a senior consultant doctor (or higher), and the rest only hire board exam passers who were very impressive in med school.<br>  <br>  in other words, a medicine board exam passer should either be rich, have connections, or be very brilliant to stay here and practice medicine. also don't forget that most hospital departments are already full. junior residents would only get paid less than 15K a month and it would take years for them to move up the ladder and be a consultant doctor where they'll earn the big bucks. there isn't an exact number how many licensed doctors work abroad, but it'll be a shame if they did something else other than being a doctor.|`|c5s0SdaLaa	congrats to new doctors. if only they stay in the Philippines where they are most needed even if pay is not high.|`|aJB1OPoFaa	No there's no future here in the Philippines and I would say 50%|`|z5fFoTMBaa	I guess their childhood dream of helping their sick and poor countrymen will now change.|`|rVUvopaLaa	part will pursue residency training and some will take sub specialty training later on<br>  some would choose to migrate overseas <br>  few will take short government trainings and end up as MHOs <br>  <br>  good luck to them<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  there are many Phils graduate filipino doctors practicing or training as doctors in the country i'm based so far i haven't heard of anyone working other than a doctor if they have the qualification.  <br>  in fact 3 new MDs from NKI (national kidney institute) arrived here and currently under residency training here.|`|Ikw0ssJ6aa	some would be nurses when coming to the USA...|`|ZSAbJEv6aa	My son's girlfriend was one of the successful examinees in the latest Medical Board Licensure Examination.

Anyway, she better do her practice where she is most needed; not in some foreign lands where the most they can offer her is a job as a nurse/nursing aide or something beneath her stature as a doctor.<br>  <br>  We may have excess medical practitioners in our midst but if only our government can give its all-out support (plus incentives) to convince them to stay and practice their profession in places where there is an immediate need or lack of attending rural physicians, I think they would prefer to remain where their families are within easy reach.

AleT38EYaa	Probably the best place to bartend is near Bardstown Rd.  There are tons of bars, restaurants, and clubs, as well as affordable places to live. Although there are some "higher end" bars downtown, I still think you'd fare best in the Bardstown Rd. area.       I'd plan on budgeting about $500/month for your apartment, less if you can find a roommate (louisville.craigslist.com is a good place to start).  If you live off Bardstown Rd you could walk to work, stores, etc and maybe not need a car, although the TARC busline is very consistent through this area.
jLTDqVHsaa	No, not too far at all!.  Just jump on the 7 train.  Either the (7) local or  express will get you there.  The beginning of the line is Times Square.  Willets Point Boulevard/Shea Stadium/Citi Field/(whatever other name it will have when Citi pulls out of the naming deal) is the second-to-last stop on the line.  It takes about 30 minutes local, or about 25 express.    The Long Island Rail Road will probably not be a practical way to do it.  It'll be a bit faster, but it'll also cost more than twice as much, and you'll have to actually get to Penn Station first to get it.  The $3.25 CityTicket fare is tempting on SAT/SUN, but CityTicket is NOT valid for trips to Shea Stadium.  I presume the same rule will be in effect for when that station serves Citi "Taxpayer" Field.    Keep an eye out for whether the name of the field changes.  That's being discussed now, as Citi is failing!  They might not be able to afford the $400 million naming rights deal.    That's all you need to know to get to Citi Field (or whatever it'll be called) and see the Mets!  Good luck, and wear some blue-and-orange, will ya? :)|`|xiB1BPwsaa	It's about 1/2 an hour to 45 min away on the number 7 train.|`|tyuto8Dnaa	you can take that or the LIRR less stops cleaner more expensive though|`|958EXZEhaa	DIRECTIONS - takes  you about 36 minutes    Entrance near intersection of W 42nd St and Broadway    Take the 7 Express train from 42 St - Times Square station heading to Queens / Flushing    Get off at Willets Pt - Shea Stadium    Exit near intersection of 126th St and Willets Point Blvd    Start out going South on 126th St towards Roosevelt Ave Brg    TOTAL TRAVEL   7.49 miles    36 mins|`|AA11620976	A couple of things to know   1) The LIRR is  the Long Island Rail Road which is the largest commuter RR in America and possibly the world  Your best option is actually the   7 Train which will take you directly to TS and the reason is that if you add the time that you have to wait for a LIRR train to the time that it takes to get to TS from Penn Station  the  7 train option is actually faster  Fares on NYC subways and buses are paid for  by something called a MetroCard  If you open up this link  you will see that are incredible values offered on "unlimited travel "cards   http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/metrocard/mcgtr...  Here's  Station list for the  7 train  http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/service/se...  All NYC subway lines have 2 basic varieties of service >local and express  All local trains stop at express stops But obviously the express trains don't stop at local stops   On this map the local stops are the black circles and the express stops are the white circles  http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/nyct/maps/subma...  So your strategy is to take local train to an express stop and then catch an an express to your final destination or any variation of that idea  On the 7 the local train has  "7" inside a  circle an the express has the "7 " Inside a diamond  2)There are actually 2 Chinatowns in NYC There is the most famous one in Lower Manhattan and then there  is the onein Flushing  that  is one subway stop east of Shea Both are worth a visit  3) To the issue of ballparks   I'm not sure what your experience with watching baseball is But after almost 50 years of going to baseball games I can tell you the best seats to actually watch any game from are those that are directly behind home plate and a couple of levels up  In this ballpark that would be sections 317-325  Enjoy the game  http://newyork.mets.mlb.com/nym/ticketin...|`|FJ7pydizaa	Citi Field, as it should be called (a joint venture of the NY Mets and Citigroup), will be served by the  7 (Flushing) train you can catch at  Grand Central terminal on Lexington Ave.at 42nd St., just a few blocks down from your hotel. From Times Square, just walk east down 42nd St. to Lexington Ave. Be prepared to pay your fare by purchasing a Metrocard at a touch-screen machine using dollar bills or credit card. One way fare is $2.00. The Willets Point/Shea Stadium stop will be yours. It should take approx 20 minutes to get there. Hope this helps!|`|f8aa8e21997cfa7908574dfa12f124cdaa	My friend, the trip from Times Square to Citifield is about 45 minutes on the subway (underground), 15 to 20 minutes on the Long Island Railroad.     From Times Square, you can take the  7 subway line (Purple Line on the underground map) to Willest Point-Shea Stadium. Once there you following the crowd going to the ballpark.    If you travel on the Long Island Railroad (we locals called it LIRR), take the Port Jerfferson Branch from Penn Station to Shea Stadium. Penn Station is located on 34th Street, which is 8 blocks south of Time Square.    The fare on the subway is $2 USD one way, however, if you in town for a week or two weeks, you can purchase an unlimited ride MetroCard, which will allow you ride the subway and bus system for as many times as you wish. The $7-day pass costs $25 USD and the 14-day pass cost $47 USD.    If you take the LIRR, a round trip ticket from Penn Station to Shea Stadium will cost you $8.50 USD. However, if you traveling on the weekend, the fare is reduced to $6.50 USD through a special weekend ticket called a CityTicket.    I hope this information is very helpful. If you have any questions or need travel directions while in town, just drop me a line by clicking on the avatar and e-mail icon in the profile. I'll be glad to help.

IHhDMHrGaa	Yes you can leave the United States... just ask you doctors about the health risks in the country or area where you will be working. They can tell you how to keep yourself healthy when you travel. Also, ask them if they know doctors from the region where you are going. Also, make sure you know if the country you plan to go to have special health rules. hese rules can include vaccinations that may not be safe for you to take. Your doctor or local health department can help you with this.    I hope this helps and good luck!|`|EJAvOHxGaa	Yes, you can leave the usa but would other countries take you.

Immigration rules vary country to country.|`|qPaREyr2aa	I'm sure they could|`|f4759393d980deadc3255b5837265f76aa	Interesting question.  I don't see why the US would prevent one from leaving, I suspect one might have a problem entering other countries though.
Vlp50eEGaa	Not for a expat is it enough. You can live on it OK, but for a westerner it is peanuts.  Other questions I would hope you asked is how big is the apartment is in square meters and number of bedrooms, does your apartment cost include electric and water also are you far from the sky train or subway  The answer is at lease  60 meters if your single and 100 if married and with family the answer to the other questions are YES. You should be making over 100,000.  I sure hope you don't have a family.  Because an International schools will cost you far more then 49,000 baht a month.|`|86e53ae673b0e71a74c555f56f9f3708aa	After tax and rent free it's not good but not terrible. You could live fairly well on that amount of money as long as you're not out partying too much and don't mind eating local Thai food for most of your meals you shouldn't have much problem getting by. If you eat at western restaurants a lot, frequent the bars and pubs regularly and have a difficult time keeping your libido in check, then you might not make it. It all depends on the lifestyle you want to live.|`|AA10254694	$1400 US per month is OK especially with your rent being paid.  Your not going to get rich but if your careful with your money you can save some and enjoy a year or two in Thailand.|`|AA11691241	If your living rent free,then 49,000 Baht a month  you can get by.    You say `Costly Thai city`Do you mean Bangkok?If so,then it`s not necessarily costly at all.Sure Bangkok you can go crazy and spend a fortune each month ,but you can also live pretty cheap and still have a good time.It`s only costly if you make it that way.Once you have lived there for a while you`ll learn places that are not overpriced,still offer good food or a good night out,but inside your budget.  Compare it to living in say Phuket or Koh Samui ,then it`s cheap!Very!.  Transport ,eating and drinking  there are many options to cut cost if need be.|`|AA11527203	Yeah, if you have company car and driver.|`|qUiQF8x3aa	That amount wont give you the life of luxury. But if the rent ed accomadation is free and you only have to pay electric and water, it will give you a pleasant but modist lifestyle. Just keep away from the many bars at nite and better to 'eat locally' and avoid the expensive western resturants.|`|AA11390623	I guess it is ok, but maybe not alot of money - - it depends on what your standards are... what are you making now and where?? - - but that is less than $50 a day in spending money - sure, you can live on that, but, I would not consider it "good" in comparison to what other westerners are making, but again,that depends on the type of work - if you are teaching english, its pretty good - -     bigger question might be how much you enjoy either the work or being here
py57svUyaa	there is no custom going between denmark, greece and italy. It is all european union. the only custom control you may go thru would be your first entry to EU. depending on which country you are from they may be more or less interested in you. But typically you just walk thru. It is passport control that can take some time because there is a line of people. So it is anything between 20 seconds and an hour, depending on your luck.<br>  <br>  the only other place that would have custom control is switzerland but the most they would do is to ask if you have anything that needs to be declared.

And there's a lot of nature - including bugs, spiders and snakes and other predators.  There are also a lot of hunters.  I have a friend who moved to the country several years ago.  She loves her land.  But even though she lived in the inner city for years with no problems, she had to buy a gun when she moved to the country.  She has a serious problem with hunters trespassing on her land.  Several have been drunk and she's been threatened repeatedly.  There have also been a lot of robberies in her area.  When you don't have a neighbor for miles, someone can pull a U-Haul up to your place and take everything without being seen.  One neighbor had everything stolen including fixtures while he was away on a camping trip.  Now he has bars on all of his doors and windows.

9N6sW6KAaa	personally i just jump from perth to sydney|`|AA12074269	Petrol stations can be up to 300km apart with not a house between. Yes, beware of speeding as they monitor speed from the air - you pass lines on the road Xkm apart and they time you, and since there are no turnoffs for 1500km, they know where to find you.|`|vgNELAQIaa	Been there done that....    Suggest your motorcycle be nothing under 650 cc. A smaller engine with the higher revs on such distance can be numbing to the body and deafening to the ears.    Both the Nullarbor, Perth to Port Augusta (little over half way to Sydney) and the Stuart Highway Port Augusta to Katherine section can be mind numbing boring journey. All the country looks the same. You need to source out interesting stops to break the boredom and tedious countryside, but there are plenty of places to find worthwhile stopping at.    Ensure you have a bike with a tank big enough to take you 400 klms. It is not that far between fuel stops, but unexpected events can occur you may need to back track. So either a good size tank or a small extra can of say 10 or 20 litres to be safe.    Kangaroos are not much of a worry except early morning and late afternoon, but emus can be fatal. They are dumb !! They can be standing way off to the side and suddenly get spooked and run right in front of you.    You can legally camp along the roadsides as long as you are far enough off to be safe and don't cut fences or go through gates, and venture no further than 50 metres from the roads edge.     Take plenty of water and a real life saver is a product called "fix-a-flat" which is a self seal tyre inflater/repairer if you get a small puncture.    The road surface is very good all the way, unless you get some damage from a flood or similar, but not likely on the Nullabor.    Point of interest, and not well known.... look for NASA's Space Shuttle emergency landing strip along the highway.    Between Port Augusta and Sydney, you can choose several different courses to take. Once you hit the Hay plain which passes through Broken Hill,not much to see except within the towns themselves.    Go a little further south following the Murray River is the most scenic, but the slowest.    There are official road-side rest stops every 75 - 100 klms from Sydney to Perth where you can legally camp also.    Given the distance, expect to have to replace your rear tyre due to low tread (worn out). Depending on the make of tyre, and size of the bike, you will get as low as 4,000 and up to 20,000 klms out of a tyre on those highways. Soft compounds will give you the best traction, but the lowest mileage.    Speeding motorbikes on NSW roads are one of a police mans favourite targets.      Have fun.|`|NyJeK6NSaa	The distance from Perth to Sydney by road, is close to 4000 kilometers and in my opinion it is dangerous to travel by motorcycle because traveling 4000kms makes you tired and also you may feel uneasy driving these many kilometers.You can find rest places.It is better to choose another option such as train or plane.|`|s2IOyj8iaa	Oh yes you can . Fabulous trip People even take out many weeks and cycle . There are roadhouses along the Nullabor you can take a shower or get a motel room or there are plenty of rest areas if you prefer to take a light tent . It's no more dangerous than travelling on any highway There are plenty of those huge road trains travelling and they cause a big wind if one overtakes. Just be careful. No speeding. You might think your in the middle of nowhere when suddenly a police appears. Carry water with you and you can buy meals on the Nullabor.|`|UqPZezXBaa	Yes, a very long trip but also very spectacular. I must admit I drove and camped out along the Nullabor (literal translation - No Trees) which was awesome. Big drops over the cliffs and you can stand on the edge and often see sharks and dolphins below. If you are camping out.. take warm gear as it gets very cold at night. Good Luck, Jamie http://www.AccommodationSydney.tv|`|Fhro4oUaaa	Perth to Sydney is 4200 km. Road houses are no more than 200km apart. The nasa landing site is actually an airstrip marked on the road for the flying doctor to land to pick injured motorists. Its 10 k east of Madura Pass. There are other attractions signposted along the road. Another answer is a bit confused about where the Hay plains are. They are in Southern NSW. that is via Mildura in Victoria. Better still when you get to Mildura follow the Murray river as far a near as you can. Plenty to look at . When you get to Albury head north to Sydney but keep off the main highway. The other way is through Broken Hill and again there is lots to see. Don't do it too fast as a lot can be missed. Why not follow the coast instead of inland highways.

NPAQxqgNaa	California is the most expensive place to live right now.  Even if you were older and had an education it would still be a huge pain.  Yes, the weather is nice, but I know people with college degrees who can't even find jobs at fast food restaurants right now.  Stay where you are, save up some money, and get an education before you try and make it in California.|`|A8F4HF3Paa	You may want to work but it's hard to get a job out here if you're not 18 and don't have a diploma.

I hear it's grown quite a bit.  <br>  <br>  There is nice scenery (Sonoma and Napa valleys), and I found it very laid back.

There should be sentences before and after this.    "?u sa?? ba?l? olan m?" means "Is it that one with [her?] hair tied?" That's all I can tell you for sure.    "Yani" sort of means "it means." Here it could either mean "Do you mean it was that one with her hair tied who...?" or "I mean, is it that one with her hair tied who...?"    And then you have "kar?ma." It means "to/at my wife." So now you have two possibilities, either "I mean, is it that one/Do you mean that one with her hair tied, my wife,...?" or "I mean, is it that one/Do you mean, that one with her hair tied [is doing/did something or other] to my wife?"    Like I said, we need more info mate!
2wyDALHgaa	Think about it, they want your personal info and is that something you should give out to a total stranger?  They already know you have something for sale that perhaps they are interested in and maybe they are looking for a way to get it for free one night while you are out.    Don't be so careless with your info.  You may want to sell something but that doesn't give anyone the right to ask your personal info at this point in the process.
AA10199093	There are a couple of hotels near Fremont that charge if you're not a guest of the hotel, but frequently depending on the day or time, they'll waive the fee if you get the ticket validated.  If you're going to the Fremont area at night, park at the Golden Nugget.  It's the favorite downtown and has well lit parking.  I frequently park at Main Street because I like the microbrewery they have and the parking is free, but unless you know the area, I would only park there during the day.      As far as the strip goes, the parking is free.  Doesn't matter if it's Venetian, Wynn, Caesars, etc.  Just make sure you park in self parking unless you're in a rush, then you can park in valet.    With that said IF you have to pay for parking it will only cost you a couple of bucks and definitely less than $10.  It's not like mid-town Manhattan where you pay $45 for an hour.  I think the only place I pay for parking on the strip is the parking garage next to M&M World and it's about $3 for a couple of hours.      The short answer: you will spend very little on parking in Las Vegas.|`|kIbZ7YzZaa	The garages on the strip offer free parking.  If you are staying downtown i would think the parking would be a free service included with your room rate.        But if you are not staying downtown you need to have your parking ticket validated at one of the casinos or there is a charge.    Its no big deal just go to the cashier at the golden nugget and have them stamp it.    Sorry I cant remember what daily charge is if you dont get it validated.|`|urHPuzMsaa	All hotels and casinos have free parking. Even valet is free, it is your choice to tip a couple of buck to bring your car to you.

It's not that much either, around $5. I went to the Hilton for the Star Trek Experience, this was quite a few years ago so they might not charge for parking anymore.    Follow the signs for "Self Parking" at any resort, they're all free and have security cameras all over the place.|`|910537da330152ad69b869eeff90d14eaa	free to park your car in the casino parking lots.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	Parking is free nearly everywhere in Vegas.

Il0QA1Hcaa	Airfare is like the stock market it is changing by the hour.  My suggestion would be keep checking around and if you find a deal jump on it. Hotwire.com and Lastminutetrips.com work great, but only go ahead for about 20 days. If you prefer a special hotel or seats on the plane then I would book soon. If you are not looking for anything spectacular then play the waiting game. You can also check out Priceline.com for name your own price. You can also book the hotel of your choice through the hotel directly. Check and see what there policy is for cancellation, such as 3 days or maybe they don't charge until you arrive. That way you are gaunted a room you can always fly stand bye.|`|arE6NuOXaa	compare rates on rooms at hotelclue.com

You can call them up and enquire, or go to their sales office, or do it directly upon checking in - upgrade to business class between KK and Sandakan used to be only RM50, but it has gone up terribly since then. I enquired recently (last year) Kuching - KK and it was over RM300; nearly as much as the regular fare. So I suppose you look into something like nearly double the regular fare for a business trip on other sectors as well.|`|0exde9VEaa	Change of class -  depends on the type of ticket you purchased - e.g. if you got your ticket cheap, you cannot upgrade - you have to purchase a new ticket and forfeit the old one...others, you pay an admin. cost plus a refund of part of what you paid, and you purchase a new ticket ....There is also a time timit for arranging this.

1f88iwfMaa	Most snow storms during the winter come from colds fronts that push toward the southeast from the Arctic and Great Lakes. Around DC, however, the Appalachian Mountains to the west get in the way. It's difficult to think of clouds having "weight", but they do. Storm clouds are often heavy with moisture and sit further down in the atmosphere, closer to the ground. Those clouds are forced to dump snow on the wayward side of the mountains in order to "lighten" and pass over the peaks. This results is large snow accumulations in West Virginia and western Pennsylvania. However, after dumping so much snow to the west, the storms have considerably less moisture by the time they get to DC and we get less precipitation.     The best snow-producing storms are called Nor'easters, but they are rare. They form on the coast of the southeast US where they gain moisture and strength before heading north. Since the topography along the coast is relatively flat (i.e. no mountains), the storms progress north unstopped and dump a large amount of snow in the area.    The final problem is that DC is often too warm to get large amounts of snow. The DC area only gets what you probably consider to be "proper snowfall" on average once every 4 to 6 years, according to the National Weather Service. We're probably due for another big storm in the next year or so (it could even happen this year). There's nothing unusual about the current weather pattern.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	Sometimes it does.  We got a huge snowstorm about six years ago that dumped roughly 18 to 20 inches on us.  I frankly think snowmen are overrated, but then I worry about walking through the snowbanks and maneuvering on the ice to get to work.    Maybe it's global warming?|`|2EVoNHHbaa	Adam gave you a good explanation of our local weather conditions.    But the question is still out there--why are there indications (such as the lack of large snowstorms in recent years) of climate change?  Scientists are studying the question and trying to determine if there is indeed long-term change, or if it's just the usual climate patterns.  Some folks point to this as additional evidence of global warming.|`|CKRtwea6aa	It all depends on the jet stream and the storm patterns. I live MD east of DC and and have seen some severe winter storms. Blizzards, Northeasterns come up in the winter. Below zero temps. Snow so deep that bulldozers had to be called in to break the roads open for passage, days without electricity, freezing water lines, shoveling, shoveling, shoveling . . . . Hmmm..... kinda glad we don't get a lot of snow like we used to.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Sometimes it seems like it does.  But usually there is a generous amount of snowfall each winter.  I've made snowmen in the past many times in Northern VA.|`|AA11828439	Luck|`|W6mRRCVNaa	Because the folks in DC and surrounding areas couldn't handle it.

HvyE4qpYaa	Sounds like you're looking for fun in the sun while being able to mingle with the locals... something you just can't do in Cancun.      I would suggest Brazil... especially Rio de Janeiro.... but they speak Portuguese there.     the beaches in Northern Chile (from La Serena all the way to Arica)... although they are in a very arid climate, you get some amazing views... and not too far away you have cool, beautiful mountains... plus travelling within Chile is super safe,      For a tropical experience: Try the Dominican Republic... rich culture, but u might be confined to a lot of resorts.... and it's a bit more dangerous.     Now, are you Mexican, or Mexican-American?  If you're Mexican... try out Cuba.... there's resorts, but with your Spanish you'll be able to navigate the streets easily.  If you're American, forget about this option.     1 choice for me would be Dominican Republic.|`|QMsUPMRKaa	My friend has lived all over the world.  He says Peru is the best place to visit.|`|f6a42ef1b57ba4b191c4db4cc48534edaa	If beach is mandatory, I would suggest Panama, Colombia, and Peru. Panama in Panama, San Andres Island in Colombia, and anywhere up or down the coast of Peru.|`|r1ArUiaGaa	definately colombia|`|x5Bj1q8Caa	Guatemala. Specifically, check out Antigua. It has old monasteries, convents, and churches you can tour during the day, not to mention the rest of the town is worth seeing.    During the night, it has an equal number of nightclubs and bars to visit. There are numerous Spanish language schools there and its a very popular stop in Latin America. You'll meet people from all over the world.    Holy week is coming up at the end of March (last week) and beginning of April (first week) and the town of Antigua is filled with processions and ceremonies, rituals and such.     The town is small considering the number of sites and places you can visit and transportation is just a took-took away (mopeds with enclosed seating on the back).    The beach is about 3 hours away and you can catch a bus from Antigua to and from.    So it's worth checking out.
pm2EeEgiaa	The Philippines is a good country, according to the millions of Western tourists and Asian travelers who have made it their home.    Imagine:  1. The world's largest and classiest malls within your reach - European brands such as Armani and Prada as common as local brands.    2. The world's most beautiful people right outside your doorstep - The mixture of the classic Spanish beauty, exotic Chinese charm, and esoteric Malay features blended into one people. The Philippines is home to lots of Miss International, Miss World, and Miss Universe, as well as some Mister Universe winners.    3. The world's most surprising diving spots just a drive away - the Philippines has been voted as the world's top diving spot - right beside Palau and Maldives. With the Philippines being the world's top country in number of endemic coral species, its underwater beauty cannot at all be underestimated.    4. Asia's most exciting and vibrant culture and nightlife, a fusion of the Latin and the Asian in a colorful way. Fiestas, hip bars and clubs, high culture parties. After 500 years of uninterrupted European and American colonization and influence, the Philippines is undoubtedly the world's largest Eurasian country in the world, both in culture and in its population. It is Asia's only country whose culture has been classified as "Western". It is also one of the world's largest Christian nations, and is the world's third largest English speaking country.    5. The world's most exciting ecotourism adventure destination. Consistently voted the best beach in the world (Boracay), the best hidden cove treasure (Survivor!

aKqWOEoPaa	I'm not sure if you're looking for the typical tourist destinations, but of all them, one of my favourites is Science World, now Telus World of Science. It was built for Expo '86 and it is truely unique and a wonderful place to be.<br>  <br>  During the last week of June, I believe is the Vancouver International Jazz Festival. There are lots of great performances, mainly at the Roundhouse, former railway station in the beautiful False Creek area.<br>  <br>  In terms of fun restaurants, with bang for your buck, I reccomend Stepho's Souvlaki Greek Taverna. If you like Greek food, this is great place. A delicious meal of lamb is under $10, I believe. There are always huge line ups to get in, but it is well worth it. It is located at 1124 davie street. Davie Street in itself is a fun location. It is home to Vancouver's gay population. It has an especially celebratory feel in the summer, when the sun is shining off the fuschia garbage cans and bus stops. If you're here the last week of July/first week of August, be sure to check out the gay pride parade, it is a site well worth seeing.<br>  <br>  Another destination restaurant is the Salmon House on the Hill in West Vancouver. You can experience food of the West Coast while overlooking the city of Vancouver. It is stunning.<br>  <br>  Another favourite place is Granville Island. You can get to it many ways, but one of the most fun ways is to take the aquabus from various locations in the city. Granville Island has lots of nice art, performers, and restaurants.<br>  <br>  There are so many lovely things to see and do in Vancouver. If you just start walking around, you're bound to stumble upon something that catches your interest. That's just the way it is in Vancouver, especially during the summer.|`|VxZT0RMqaa	Hi there:<br>  don't know where you're coming from, but most Vancouverites just like to hang out at the beach (English Bay, Kitsilano, Spanish Banks) and throw a frisbee or do some beach volleyball or something with friends.  If you're a tourist, you'd probably want to see Stanley Park with its Aquarium and Prospect Point view, go to Capilano Suspension Bridge and fish hatchery in North Van or go up Grouse Mountain and catch Vancouver at dusk (incredibly beautiful).  If you do want to go to Grouse, make a dinner reservation ahead of time (around 6:30 to catch the sunset) and you won't need to pay for the expensive ride up.  The food's ok, but if you have to pay for the ride up, you may as well get something for it.  <br>  If you like Chinese food, you won't get better than Vancouver.  Hands down over Toronto, San Fran, just look into almost any restaurant with a ton of Chinese people in it in Richmond (a southern suburb over the bridge) or Vancouver and you'll get the best Chinese food this side of Asia, in fact some say better than Asia as a lot of their best chefs immigrated to Vancouver in 1990's.  If you like Japanese fod, there are a number of all you can eat Japanese food lunches (sushi, noodles, etc.) for $9.95.  Maybe not truly authentic, but very tasty and cheap.<br>  Gastown is overrated as a tourist place, but if you do go, in fact wherever you go, watch out for your purse/wallet and if you're driving or renting a car (esp. with a foreign license plate), make sure you lock and alarm your vehicle.  If you do have a car, I'd really recommend a drive to Horseshoe Bay, about 3/4 hour outside of West Vancouver.

It is an area of around 350,000 square kilometres that overlaps the mountains of four countries of Southeast Asia: Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand. (Other interpretations of the Golden Triangle also include a section of Yunnan Province, China.) Along with Afghanistan in the Golden Crescent and Pakistan, it has been one of the most extensive opium-producing areas of Asia and of the world since the 1950s.

You're not supposed to eat with your left hand, and don't show too much of your goodies around. It's not very cold in Morocco that time of year, around 50 or 60 degrees Fahrenheit. Since you're going to be pretty much going around solo, you don't have to adhere as much to the cultural etiquette, but should know it in the event that you're asked to dinner or make some new Moroccan friends. Depending on where you go in Morocco, you will have to feel out how conservative the area is. <br>  <a href="http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resources/global-etiquette/morocco-country-profile.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/resource...</a><br>  That link gives a little insight into what you will be facing. As far as getting around, they have buses and taxi cabs all over, and if you feel more comfortable just wandering alone, you can rent a car - many of the same companies we have here in the USA they have in Morocco. Avis, Enterprise, Budget, as well as many companies from Europe. If you want to do that, you'll have to observe the flow of traffic, it is so much different (and appears to be dangerous) than anything I've seen here in the USA. What to do! Sight seeing! Go to the shops, go to the Cafes, they have movie theatres and everything that they have other places. Pool halls and Cafes would be good places to make some new friends! Good luck planning.

Imqb5ueqaa	The answer is right there in your question --- there is a lodge named TRAVELLERS INN in san Pablo. It is definitely affordable because salesmen stay there and not in the expensive resorts nor in the best hotel (Cocoland).<br>  <br>  Travellers Inn is on your left side when entering San Pablo City.

AA10259042	I am not sure which city is the least expensive to fly out of but I do think that either Quito or Guayaquil in Ecuador might be your best bets to fly into.  Once you are there, you can catch a bus to just about anywhere in South America on the west coast.  Buses are extremely inexpensive means of travel there.  But be very cautious with your luggage. Luggage has a way of disappearing if you let it out of your site for one minute.  It is ok to check it on a bus provided you are there when the bus driver opens the bin.  Also air travel in South America is not too expensive, but it is much more than bus travel.  The reason I suggest one of those Ecuador cities is because they are both very popular tourist destinations and there are quite a few flights to and from them so the competition might mean lower prices.  I do know for a fact that flying into Guayaquil is about $300 less expensive than flying into Lima. And a bus from Guayaquil to Lima is about $30 or so. It is a long trip though by bus.  It should be broken into a couple of segments with stops in Piura or Chiclayo. Then from Lima you can catch a flight to Iquitos if you want to experience the Amazon jungle. And there you can hire a boat for the day to take you up or down the Amazon.  You can also visit the Allpahuay-Mishana reserve about 30 minutes from Iquitos by taxi. A great place to experience some of the wild life. From Iquitos you can get a flight to Cuzco and then visit Machu Picchu.  Then a bus to Puno on Lake Titicaca (not to be missed) and then a bus to Chivay in Canon del Colca a canyon twice as deep as the Grand Canyon (also not to be missed).  From there you are a relatively short bus trip to Tacna the border crossing into Chile.  From Chile you then have the option of taking a bus across the Andes into Argentina and on to Iguazu (a very long way by bus) then on to Tierra del Fuego (best reached by plane)

Right now, Venice or Ivrea <a href="http://www.carnevalediivrea.it/defaulteng.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.carnevalediivrea.it/defaulten...</a> in Italy would be very good choices since Carnevale is going strong. <br>  <br>  A few places that might particularly suit all your criteria include Amsterdam, Prague, Munich, and Krakow.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Kraków is a great place to visit. <br>  <br>  Costs are about 1/2 what they are in places like France and Spain on the Euro.<br>  <br>  Most things are a short walk from the old market square, so stay near there if you can. As such, the old town it is full of old churches, gorgeous buildings, and a very large and vibrant town square lined with cafes. There are lots of classical music concerts. Visit St. Marys Cathedral and the other great churches in the old town. Walk up to Wawel hill and visit the Royal Cathedral and Palace. Take day trips to O?wi?cim (Auschwitz) and to the Wieliczka Salt Mine, and perhaps to the Eagle-nest Castles in the mountains. Visit the Museums. <br>  <br>  The most striking thing I remember from Kraków is the Kraków Hourly Trumpet Signal<br>  <br>  Every hour a golden trumpet shows above Kraków's central Grand Square in the west window just below the spire of the higher, municipal tower of the St. Mary's Basilica. Then a characteristic trumpet signal, known and dear to every Pole, played by a live trumpet player, resounds all over the city's Old Town historical district. All of a sudden the melody comes to an abrupt end. The Kraków signal, or Hejnal Mariacki, dates back to the Middle Ages when it announced the opening and the closing of the city gates. The bugler also played it to alarm his fellow citizens whenever he saw a fire or enemy forces. And the melody's abrupt ending is said to commemorate a bugler shot through his throat by a Tatar archer in 1241.<br>  <br>  My advice would be to rent a condo near the market square, inside the Planty. I had one last June, it was great, just a stone's throw from St. Mary's. The market square has several dozen outdoor cafe's, and there are hundreds of restaurants/bars within a block or two.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of Zywiec.<br>  <br>  Warsaw is worth a few days, for all of the WWII monuments, memorials, and memories, Getto museums and memories, plus the old town. It's a 4 hour train from Kraków.<br>  <br>  Get the Rick Steves DVD on Eastern Europe, which covers these cities, plus others.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Prague is great, you can easily spend a week there.<br>  <br>  Prague has the market square, charles bridge, and the castle hill with<br>  St Vitus Cathedral and the palace a short tram ride away, or a longish<br>  walk.<br>  <br>  If you get a condo in the right place, you can walk to the major attractions in each city. <br>  <br>  Contact me if you want more info.<br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|T5DbLLgQaa	Slovenia, a true hidden gem by the Adriatic Sea!

95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	There's so much in both Ireland and the UK that they each merit their own trip. You would easily fill 2 weeks in Ireland and barely scratch the surface. <br>  <br>  Second honeymoon in Italy? Got to be Venice. Just don't go in Carnival season or in late summer. Italy closes down every August.|`|LsvPNA2Faa	i dunno about ireland but , u could do a paris - amsterdam - london trip going on, amsterdam and paris  are so beautiful and paris is specially romantic for couples !!<br>  <br>  <br>  if u want to heat up the love between u 2 , then thats where u need to go
pcHp7Dgkaa	The best place to work depends on what type of work you're asking about and the same applies to how much you can earn. It is not possible to answer your questions accurately without knowing your occupation and level of qualifications and experience.|`|V7ZMPAcSaa	I won't help you - you refuse to help yourself. It is obvious that you lack the level of English competence required to be provided with a migrant visa.|`|84VU39Kcaa	if your indian, taxi driver or telemarketer.|`|2F939JONaa	Stay in India...<br>  <br>  Its better there.
5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	Japanese population is pretty high in Illinois. <br>  Also, Ann Arbor, Michigan has a high population, but no "Japan-town" thing going for it.  Though there are a lot of shops in Novi, Mi.<br>  <br>  Next place I can think of would be California and Washington State.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  AAAHH! How could i forget Hawaii?! Dang!!  Yeah, Hawaii has loads of Japanese.|`|eAMbWkahaa	You missed one big one.<br>  HAWAII.<br>  <br>  Japanese people visit Hawaii all the time, and the history of Hawaii has some Japanese influence as well.<br>  <br>  Everytime I visit Honolulu or any major part of Hawaii it was like I was back in Japan with all the Japanese people.<br>  <br>  Also hell Hawaii is paradise even without Japanese influence, good weather all the time, nice beaches, ah if I had money I'd retire there.|`|Q3RqWHFsaa	I think Little Tokyo, Los Angeles would be also closer place to Japanese culture as NYC in USA.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Hawaii is your best bet. They have the biggest Japanese population in the US. San Francisco,San Jose, and Los Angeles also have "Japan-town" areas.Hawaii is very costly to live though.And most Japanese who live in the US tend to lose their "Japaneseness".
wJhZnNV7aa	Not all canadians speaks french. Quebec speaks french and alot of english. You may have a better chance of getting a job if you are bilingual but not always. And it could be spanish, chinese, japanese or something else as well. It depends where you want to live the bigger cities are more expensive to live such as toronto is pricey. Apply for a bunch of jobs all over and wherever you get call backs research that place. Many nice places in canada to live go luck in your search.|`|AA10982716	Montreal used to be the telemarketing scam capital of North America. I think it's largely cleaned up but there is still a fair bit of legitimate telesales going on. Montreal is French-speaking (well, bilingual) but you'd be selling to people all across Canada, maybe the US as well so you don't necessarily need French for that.<br>  <br>  I think Toronto has a lot of telesales as well.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Canada speaks English everywhere but Quebec and most normal Canadians dont speak french.  Please note however that nobody wants a telemarketer!!!|`|BA3tFr4oaa	Montreal is a great place to live, you do not need to speak French to live here, (of course, it would be useful), but I only really speak French in school, no need for it anywhere else. There are some great suburban areas to live, as well as a busy downtown. I would recommend to live in the Cote-Saint-Luc, or Hampstead areas. Shopping isn't a problem around here. As for jobs, you shouldn't have a problem finding something around here.|`|4Dr9lSJEaa	Hi, Im in same stuation as you, as I moved from britian so I can't speak french but Im learning, which is good to learn a newlanguage, most people has speak english in here, bilaugual I live in Montreal and it's a great city and friendly people. but if u only want to speak english than u should go to Toronto, it's all english there..just to let u know I heard the life is more expensive in Toronto but I don't know if it's right.. good luck to you,|`|6EOhhQZ1aa	So who told you that lots of Canada speak French? lol it is completely a misinformation There is one province in Canada that speaks French in provincial level is Quebec and the rest of Canada 9 provinces and 3 territories do speak English. If you want to live in a bilingual city then go to Ottawa, the capital city of Canada which is cheaper and safer than Toronto and Vancouver|`|1neMZoRLaa	not everywhere speaks french. I think it's mostly quebec that speaks french.But  even then you don't need to know french.they are bilingual|`|aYNMs5vUaa	to live Montreal, it is fun place to live and to enjoy yourself. but some Quebecois people love their language (french) and if you get lucky you might have few experience with some of them they command you to speak french even they do speak English. but hi french is beautiful language so my advice take advantage and learn it too it is an asset , <br>  <br>  for work telesales here is this phone number call them for work interview 514-842-555 speak to jude wong. her office located in down town montreal . good luck and have fun if you want to enjoy yourself go to montreal

gWX21Jtwaa	Bar hop in Little Italy and China Town.<br>  Start around Mulberry st and go about 4pm to avoid the rush and get one or two drinks at one bar then walk to another go into the shops and see that is there. Then find a cool looking bar drink some more and hop to the next. Another place is up around the park (Central park) lower west side.<br>  <br>  The best places to eat are not easy to find.
