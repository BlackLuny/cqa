AA11090367	I have it!  You really can't do much to help this condition.  The worst part is that it's really embarassing.  I think the best thing a friend can do is to not make a big deal about it, and make them feel less ostracized (yes, the sweaty palms can make you feel like an outsider a lot)...  The options for curing this condition are mostly surgical -- I choose to just live with it.  Have you asked him about it?    "Help" seems a little weird to me...it's not like it's a debilitating disease, just a socially awkward condition that may make for interesting conversation starters!  message me if you're more interested in talking about this!|`|AA12181093	Primary hyperhidrosis is a rare disorder characterized by excessive sweating without known cause on the palms of the hands, the soles of the feet, in the armpits (axillary), in the groin area, and/or under the breasts. The exact cause of primary hyperhidrosis is not known. When excessive sweating occurs as part of some other disorder, it is said to be secondary hyperhidrosis, which is a more commonly encountered condition than is primary hyperhidrosis.    Surgery seems to be the answer but I disagree.  Boxtox injections under the armpits have been found to help people with this condition.  I saw that on the Today show on NBC one morning.  This lady has this condition & gets Botox injections in her armpits.  She claims it helps stop the excess sweating.|`|8160c2767ce87ac70f9a67833f4c26dcaa	This is a medical condition--excessive sweating usually on the palms sometimes on the face, feet, etc.    There are many ways to treat the condition, but as a friend, there is not much you can do but support him.  Find out if yor community hospital has a support group, go with him to appointments.  A large part of conditions such as these is psychological, meaning he may be embarassed, frustrated etc.  Just be a good, caring, non-judgemental friend. :-)    See the link below for treatments (range from botox injections to surgery on the nerves affecting the sweating).

How well it works depends on how old and how severe the scar is.  If the scar(s) are really bad you can go to the doctor and they can give you a prescription for a topical cream that will lessen the appearance of scars.  And if that doesn't work for you there is always laser surgery.........that'll work!

Ten en cuenta que muchos son impuestos por la moda y no todos consiguen dar ese encanto a la persona, que muchas veces no acaba de gustarte, como te está quedando. Procura también buscar algún tonificador del cabello, para que no sufra demasiado con los sucesivos tintes. Debes tener en cuenta que cuando crece se te van a ver mucho mas ras raíces y la tintura tendrá que ser con cierta frecuencia. Pero es importante que busques el color que verdaderamente te favorezca y aléjate de nuevos tonos que solo harán cambiar de apariencia y con los que no te encontrarás a gusto.|`|ZBwmSaeUaa	Mejor con un profesional porque puede causar un químico en tu pelo que luego puede ser causa de perder el pelo o como dicen manchar tu pelo. Cuando decidas cual es el color que quiere para un buen tiempo luego puedes tu ponerte el tinte para las raíces.  Dejas que los de la estética llegue a color que tu de ceas siempre cuando no cambies de color cada mes porque seria imposible de llegar a un color  fijo.   Esto son paso por paso para llegar a color que tu quiere por que de traca so pues tu cabello va a racionar muy fuerte.  Suerte|`|ZmX6trggaa	yo de ti primero iría primero que todo ha consultar con un estilista para un consejo, pero mi consejo personal deja que se te caiga todo el rojo y luego te lo pintas del color que quieres así no da?aras tu pelo,|`|a2b73c6d57583f203ae5ad58e1df9b40aa	yo que vos, aglojo un poco con los tintes porque vas a terminar con el pelo super estropeado !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  lo mejor  será que le des respiro, sino sonás.....|`|b93dbcf46c763bebf2143fc3dc16c623aa	Asi no se hace esto. <br>  El tinte rojo que tenias no fue eliminado de tu cabello, por eso lo tienes cafe. <br>  <br>  Si te pones un rubio 7,8,9 o 10, te vas a ver muy chistosa, porque en la raiz te va a tomar un color, y en el cabello que ya tiene tinte, otro color.<br>  <br>  Tienes que 'remover' el tinte que tienes actualmente. Un tinte claro no te va a 'agarrar' sobre uno mas oscuro. Eso aprendetelo muy bien.  Tu cabello primero tiene que soltar el tinte que tiene para poder tomar otro, sobre eso no hay vuelta de hoja.<br>  <br>  A mi me paso lo mismo, mi precioso color rojo lo cambie por un rubio cenizo claro. Hay te va como lo estoy haciendo.<br>  <br>  Primero compre un producto que se llama ColorFix, no es un decolorante, es un REMOVEDOR de color, que es diferente.<br>  <br>  Eso lo puedes ver en www.folica.com. Tengo la suerte de vivir en US donde lo puedo conseguir en Sally Beauty Supply. Eso te lo pones y te remueve el tinte. Te lo puedes poner hasta 3 veces sin que te maltrate el cabello. A veces es necesario cuando son tintes muy oscuros.<br>  <br>  Yo me lo puse 1 vez y luego me di un tinte de miss clairol, rubio cenizo,  con una base azul/violeta. Es el 34D Hazy Mist, nivel 7.<br>  <br>  Mi nivel natural es como un 6, un rubio oscuro. Eso tambien es muy importante. De nena era muy rubia y ya de grande cambio el tono a mas oscuro, pero sigue siendo aun rubio, digo, no se cambia de pelirroja a casta?a, solo cambia el tono, y mi tono se oscurecio con el tiempo. <br>  <br>  Asi que por eso me agarro bien el nivel 7. y ahi la llevo, me volvi a remover color con el ColorFix pero solo en la parte de abajo, del nivel de las orejas para abajo porque se veia diferente el tono, era un rubio mas bien dorado (tirandole a rojizo) y me di el tinte en toda la cabeza y ya esta parejo, se ve mas natural. <br>  <br>  Despues me voy a hacer unos rayos o luces, voy a comprar ahora si, el decolorante de Robert Craig, porque quiero niveles 9 y 10 en los rayos. Ese producto es muy bueno, pues al ser una formula 'aminorada'= que amortigua una solución para disminuir su cambio de pH en tu cabello,  dando un excelente aclarado, REPITO, mantiene el PH casi sin alterar, que es lo que precisamente no hacen los otros decolorantes que usualmente se usan, y por lo cual queda el cabello tan debil que se rompe y ves tantas rubias con una puntas horribles y luego se tienen que cortar muchisimo el cabello pues se lo han estropeado.<br>  <br>  Todo esto lo hice dandome tratamientos por supuesto, tienes que hidratar tu pelo. Usa el 2+1 de Sebastian. Pontelo como tinte, en cabello humedo separa mechones y aplica con una brocha, luego con una plancha a la que le has puesto papel de aluminio alrededor pasala por lo mechones, eso te dara un tratamiento profundo.<br>  Es tardado pero vale la pena, envuelve en una gorra plastica y dejalo toda la noche. Usa Potion 9 de Sebastian antes de peinar, cada que laves tu cabello. Los tratamientos de Joico son muy buenos tambien, especialmente el K-Pak.|`|MuyZzWi3aa	Hasta donde yo sé cuando quieres pasarte de un color a otro siempre necesitas una decoloración previa. Esta decoloración puede ser un "barrido" o bien una decoloración más profunda. Acuérdate tener en cuenta también el color natural de tu cabello si éste es oscuro. La tintura sobre otra tintura nunca aclara el cabello!!!! Te recomiendo consulta a una colorista si tienes unos $$$ las decoloraciones debe hacerlas alguien que sepa. Suerte.|`|g7QvVpYJaa	mira, primero que nada se puede deducir que tienes el cabello muy da?ado o maltratado por tantos tintes que te has aplicado... después tu cabello en estos momentos esta un poco oscuro me parece, al aplicar un tinte claro sobre cabello oscuro entonces sera difícil que te agarre el color que quieres o se notara mucho el oscuro...<br>  lo mejor seria que esperes un poco mas de tiempo para que se lave el tinte que tienes y luego aplicar el color que quieras!|`|u9wFBzZ6aa	lo mejor que puedes hacer es ir a una estetica yque ahi te lo pinten pues luego queda el cabello todo manchado o t elo puedes maltratar demasiado !!!<br>  <br>  no te arriesgues y mejor ve con un profesional<br>  <br>  slds
7fb7e9b1c204fb5cad146656ddde06c4aa	Yes I was going to salons and they were too expensive.  I had one mess up my hair cut and they could not get me in.  I was always waiting long periods of time to get an apointment at the salon and I could not go often and they cost so much I could not go as often as I liked.  When my hair got botched up by the salon I called and called my regular stylest that I had been going to since middle school.  I was out of college by then and working.  I did not know what the deal was.  She did not call me back.  I even went in and talked to her and she seemed spaced out.  I had it with my bad cut.  I went straight over to supercuts on impulse and asked the woman to cut my hair that I had gotten a bad cut somewhere else.  She cut it so beautifully that I kept going back.  She left but the other people were good also.  Then a store opened up by my house and I use them and so does my boyfriend.  I had to have a medical procedure where they glued all sorts of wires in my hair.  I have very long hair and washed my hair 2x without being able to get it out.  It was goey glue.  I went over to supercuts and asked them to help me.  They washed it and combed it and conditioned it in all different directions.  I gave the woman a HUGE tip and thanked her.  She was able to get it all out.  I like the call ahead option so I do not have to wait long.  I also like how they have those cards where we can get a free hair cut.  I get my hair washed and dried in the winter.  I like that I can get that.  It is still so much cheaper than a regular salon and they are open more.  The stylists are very nice and I have never had a bad experience.  I am glad I got to make the change.  It is much more convienant.  Supercuts is clean and does well on my boyfriend as well.  I have also had them style my hair for a special event, but not all of them do that, so you have to check 1st.    Now cost cutters was bad.  They made my boyfriend with all his thick hair cut to his scalp.  The place was thilthy dirty.    Sorry about my spelling the spell check is not working.|`|aae0938e0a01ffefd43c07fa27f8f708aa	no|`|df85f95e322e40287a2524ee2c837b96aa	Not in my area I don't. None of the ladies can cut hair.

I'll never go back.|`|1611c6c9e8cba7d21015a1fb17a57220aa	I've never had a good haircut or style there, so I quit going a long time ago.  I would not go back, even if it was free.  Most of the stylists have very little experience.  I know they have to get experience somewhere, but, please, not on me.  These are the stylists who could not get jobs in upscale salons.|`|AA11872348	I got a really good hair cut at Super Cuts, the girl actually fixed the bad hair cut that I had.

cc80441971594aafe5975b4ae30f6abcaa	I have the same thing and all you can do is pull it out. Coloring your hair for 1 little grey is not worth it. You will not grow 10 back in its place I promise. I am sorry to sat though it will never stop growing back unless the follicle is damaged.|`|AA10625237	You can cover it with mascara or leave it alone and call it a "highlight."|`|ap2bicdTaa	Yank it out|`|15657093ff315a006834ccd952e350f5aa	I once had this problem. Just yank it out. Yanking one will not "sprout" new ones. Mother Nature takes her course and when she decides to gray your hair (more than one), then you have to accept it or color it! That one gray hair WILL come back. You will just have to keep your eyes wide open. <br>  <br>  I carry a pair of tweezers in my purse as I have a couple hairs that grow out of my chin (EEEEWWW) and I seem to notice them when I am in my car of all places! Perhaps the sunlight? Or that I am so close to my sunvisor mirror? My point is, the annoying hairs weather facial or on your head do not go away.<br>  <br>  I understand the frustration with having black hair as white hair is a huge contrast. My mother always had very dark brown hair. She colors it, but white hair at her roots are very noticable and aggravating.<br>   <br>  I started graying in my late twenties but fortunately it blended in with my hair as it was brown with some lighter brown streaks. As I have gotten older my hair has seemed to naturally darken until my hair started graying around my face. I notice it most when I pull my hair back. Fortunately alot of it is "underneath" as I have thick hair. When I pull it back I see ALOT of gray around the ears.<br>  <br>  So now, at 43,...I use semi permanent hair dye at home to save a buck. My last hair coloring  I paid for was a trip to a learning salon or "beauty school" where they did an excellent job of frosting, or color weaving my hair. I am not sure what it is called now! They gray still shows but not as prominent.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|SHxJyQVaaa	i'd welcome it...don't stress over it...you'll end up with more!|`|cfa653dabe1dc96fa18de7bf5200eb5aaa	You pull the white ones and you'll get 10 new white ones to take its place. Just kidding. Nothing you can do you're starting to get gray hair. Maybe a daily multi-vitamin will slow the process.|`|hlLHQ0GFaa	Ignore it. Maybe it will go away from an appaling lack of attention. Have you pulled it out all the way at the root? if not then try that.|`|vdEV4TS4aa	It will fall out on its own. But don't pull it out or you will grow 3 more.

AA11479143	I'm not sure where you live in Florida, so it is kinda hard to tell you where a store close to you is. Although you can always go to this website to purchase directly from the WWE!

0dcbf00339151b2653ef8f70762bbc1eaa	Did you talk to the person who gave you the tattoo? They should have given you instructions on how to care for it. <br>  Gently wash it with a mild soap and water. Then let it breathe. Check out this website.|`|4bfacf743830a81b96da83d19bf8b779aa	after a month you can clean it like any other part of your body.  its just until it is healed that you want to be careful.. remember they just got through poking you a thousand times with a needle so you have thousands of little holes that need to heal well and seal up that ink you paid for!!<br>  <br>  For right now just do what your artist told you.  wash it 2-3 times a day with your clean figertips and allow to air dry for 15 minutes or so.   keep it moist with moisterizer after a few days or so with a THIN layer moisterizer.<br>  <br>  It's all good.|`|nfGo9ZARaa	Ok im going to start by saying you need to ask your question a little more clearly, but from what im guessing is your asking how to keep it clean.  best advice is to follow what the artist says.<br>  <br>  Use A&D, curel, tattoo goo. <br>  <br>  No vaseline, neosporin, scented lotions.<br>  <br>  do not pick or scratch at it.<br>  <br>  do not soak in water or lay out in the sun and it should be fine.
hCErpu7Eaa	I have these extensions.<br>  <br>  They are actually a lifesaver.  My hair is thin and it helps. <br>  You buy the hair to match your hair, and if you can't find it the right color, you can always color it w/a home coloring kit.  <br>  The hair comes in a big long strand connecting, so when you buy the hair, you have to cut it yourself. The clips comes seperately, I use about 5.  You sow the top of the hair (Which is sowed together) into the clips, it is pretty simple.  I usually double up the hair to make more of it in clips.  <br>  After sowing them in and everything, clip them where you would usually keep them and cut to your length if needed.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9a9efa502b0058af7e0569bc2672d617aa	You have to sew it together with a needle and thread.|`|wBjjYN2Caa	If I am understanding this correctly, the clips you would buy would be small and the hair should be taken in small segments to be clipped on. If you are looking for length you would section a little more than top half of you hair out, and in your nape area clip the segments of hair to your hair closer to the base. spread them out evenly, then I guess thats it.
GicN1B2raa	You have just started using the product, so give it some time to see if the problem remains. Your body naturally produces more oil at night, so you may want to try a night treatment, which are generally heavier than a day time treatment. If you are still experiencing this or you just cant wait, call Proactiv and order their Daily Oil Control. You put it on after the toner and before the repairing lotion. It really helps in controlling the excess oil. However, if the Proactiv system isn't working for you after a month or so, perhaps you should try something with Glycolic Acid. This is the only cleanser that works for me. I use MD Formulations, but there are cheaper alternatives like Gly Derm gentle cleanser 2%.|`|MvVwo620aa	i usualy just use the cleanser and toner and my face never gets oily so the lotion might b the problem...if the oily skin continues, ask a doctor if u should b using it

And if you are worried about your weight excersise is the best. You should eat fruits and vegtables, and meat. Although I dont believe in eating meat because I'm a vegetarian. I also know that weight watchers is a great program.|`|DqxVHwXhaa	have you tried doing an intensive conditioning treatment at least twice a week? if not it will really help in reducing the number of split ends you get, it should make your hair shine and make it much more healthy.<br>  <br>  as for the weight, eat healthy foods. such as fruit, veg etc. stay away from all the obvious things like cake, chocolate, crisps etc.  a good balanced diet should also help give your hair back some of its natural shine.

gfMpirJeaa	I felt so sorry for the poor girl.  What I have heard from several media reports was that during the whole week that the Miss Universe contestants were in Mexico City, She was harrassed everywhere she went.  Therefore, it was because of American foreign policies , the war in Iraq and possibly immigration issues.  She must have been a nervous wreck the night of the event and maybe her knees just buckled from all the stress when she walked out on the stage.  I think those involved should be ashamed because Miss USA does not set government policies.|`|VKjUQfKvaa	Because they dont like the Americans there and um....There were illegal aliens there..|`|23d9099f0933327ba39ce022e12b6b9eaa	Maybe because she going to fell down.

It looks like she has a anorexic problem and doesnt eat. Being on America's Next Top Model doesnt mean risking your life and health. Do you know how many models have died from being too skinny and their lack of eating? This is just horrible and I think she should be elimated whoever she is. Models need to fit and healthy!

I heard that Veet works pretty well at removing hair and keeping it under control for a while longer than regular shaving. If you have sensitive skin though, I'd stay away from the Nair. Personally, it makes my legs itch and breaks me out in rashes. As well as the Epil-Stop and Spray...another rashy situation that's uncomfortable. Check the label for sensitive skin or if it's recommended for underarm use.|`|6gkeQ2Jtaa	ok, well people are saying to use products that restrict hair growth but how healthy can that be for you? a chemical that stops a natural body function? it might work but whatever it is would have to be very toxic. try something else. it might be worth saying that ur supposedly healthy cuz of your vitality in hair growth. well, that was awkward. as someone else said, good luck with that.|`|abb459f3c3277469efd71095f26e69bbaa	um i dunno...but im eating! ewww lol...<br>   thx for 2 points!|`|f8c4845b5922f8f7bb8944cdaf2afcdcaa	use a machine(shaveing)...then u won't have to do them for at least another 2 weeks|`|ol2hfaJgaa	seriously are you having a laugh!!!!!!
0k44Hr2faa	Well, what most petite girls do is that they shop in the children's section for clothes that fit.

I've done hair for 27 years and the hi liters out there are truly great and safe as long as you have it professionally done.  in addition if you only hi lite vs. all over color your touch ups are far less frequent. use professional shampoo and conditioners along with smoothing balms and anti frizz serums. just take the step and speak with your stylist most consultations are always free.
kxRjJ0bxaa	here's link to how to make your own jewelry<a href="http://www.kidzworld.com/article/4703-make-your-own-accessories:" rel="nofollow">http://www.kidzworld.com/article/4703-ma...</a>|`|2ZZKzj85aa	There are tons and tons of bead stores and craft stores that carry plastic beads- like Micheals and probably JoAnn Fabrics.  Sometimes you can save money making your own jewelry, but often you spend more money because Claire's buys their beads in bulk (really large amounts which makes it cheaper per piece) directly from a source (probably overseas.)  But it's so much fun to make your own stuff.  Check out some magazines too like Beadwork, Bead and Button, Stringing, Step-by-Step beads, etc.  They carry them at those craft stores and Barnes and Noble and some grocery stores might even have some.    And you can go here for instruction: <a href="http://beadwork.about.com/od/freebeadlessonstutorials/a/Learn_Beading.htm" rel="nofollow">http://beadwork.about.com/od/freebeadles...</a><br>  But I warn you, you might get hooked- it's a LOT of fun!<br>  Another idea for how to get beads is to take apart old necklaces and jewelry- you could even find some cool stuff at garage sales and thrift stores!
fTtn6fGRaa	I have freckles as well and I've read that they're your skin's way of telling you that you have skin damage. To get them darker you'd have to further damage your skin, so wearing sunblock will not help them get darker, it would keep them from doing so.|`|1lvAiGMEaa	lol...wow, that's a messed up situation....not wanting to burn but not wanting to defeat the purpose either.....hmm...i dunno....u prob. need a white person to help answer this....<br>  <br>  but i hope it works out for ya.....b/c i'm thinking about doing that...i'm light skinned african american w/acne scars...so i thought with darker skin, it would blend better.

GicN1B2raa	I am not surprised to hear of your trouble with this company. Replicas are illegal, so I wouldn't expect the highest company service from anyone selling them. If you've already paid w/ your credit card and are not getting a response from the company, I would call your credit card company and do a payback. In the future, you are better off buying a quality handbag, designer or not. If you deal with people in an illegal business, there's a good chance you're going to be scammed. Be thankful, most of the counterfeit are so cheaply made and fall apart easily and quickly, and it probably wasn't good enough to pass as authentic anyway.

GicN1B2raa	Do you have a parent/guardian willing to sign for consent? At 15, it is illegal to do without it and any reputable shop would not do so without consent. I wouldn't recommend going to any sleazy place that would pierce without this because if they're willing to break the law for this, who knows what else they are skimping on, especially hygienically. I would recommend South Side Tattoo for a body piercing. They are a good shop with a good reputation. My sister has gotten two tattoos and a piercing from there. It's right down on East Carson Street in South Side. Oh, and yes, it hurts, but it is not extremely painful. It's not bad at all, but in no way is it pleasant.

rFQwnqYmaa	Try OOPS you can purchase it at Wal Mart in the hardware department located near the paints.|`|rzvLuwNZaa	As usual, your first step should always be to check the care instructions for the article of clothing you will be cleaning to make sure it allows for the process outlined here. If it doesn’t or you’re not sure – either bring it to your dry cleaners or test the below process on an inconspicuous area to test for damage or discoloration.<br>  <br>  1.Pad the back of the rust stained area with several layers or paper towels. <br>  2.Saturate the rust stain with straight lemon juice. (fresh or bottled will work) <br>  3.Place the clothing in direct sunlight or someplace warm and allow the lemon juice to dry. <br>  4.Launder normally. <br>  5.If the rust stain remains and the article of clothing is white, you can boil the fabric in a solution of cream of tartar and water (use 1 tbsp cream of tartar per cup of water). This solution should remove the stain but may also leave a residue so once the rust stain has been removed you should launder the article normally. <br>  6.Failing both of the above methods, try saturating the stain with a household cleaning agent that contains oxalic acid and then laundering normally. Your local grocer should have a few of these products (Bar Keeper’s Friend is a common one); read the labels – but be warned, these products are more likely to damage or discolor your clothes so this should be a last resort.|`|gfMpirJeaa	Walmart and other merchants carry a product called Whink rust  remover.

I think the foundation powder is well worth the $25 a container, and I use it every day.  The bronzer and mineral veil are great too, but I honestly don't use them that much.  I guess I'll just have them for a long time!    As for the other stuff, I'm not so sure.  My mother has a Bare Minerals lipgloss, and it really doesn't seem any better than the L'Oreal I buy for half the price.  I've tried the eyeshadow at Sephora, and it frankly, I like Jane brand better, for about a third of the price!  It just stays in place longer.    My advice is to stick to the basics, or buy one or two of the extras that you really want just to see how you like the quality.  The catalog is really tempting, I know, when I got mine in my box I poured over it wondering what to get, but honestly there are other brands of makeup out there that are just as good if not better for lips and eyes.|`|AA12287062	I love Bare Minerals!  I've been wearing it for 3 1/2 years.  I no longer look at other brands of make up.  I love how the eye colors go on and wear, plus you can mix colors to create your own color.  I would start out with a couple eye colors and 1 shadow liner, and a versatile blush.  Remember that the colors can be mixed and worn all over.  I live 6 hours from a boutique and when I go I make sure that I take a list of colors to try and stick to a budget.  If you don't you'll regret getting all the colors.  Also make sure that the colors you want are ones that you use, some colors are very similar to others, so keep track of all the colors you have so you will know what you're getting.  Some colors you can lighten or darken and make it close to an existing shade.

She can do it right after shaving as well, it'll sting tho but it should work after a few weeks, she'll notice her armpits getting gradually lighter as time progresses

AA11107363	Every six weeks?  That's pretty often to cut hair whether it's being grown out or not.  Of course you shouldn't, trimming will only make growing her hair out take longer.  I would say, take her in for a "shaping" trim (not more than an inch off from any part of the head!) after about six months if it looks really messy, and then again after a year or whenever it is her desired length.  I know sometimes Moms like their kids looking perfect at all times, but growing out hair can be messy.  The only way to get through the messy is to let it grow!  There's rumor going around that cutting hair makes it grow faster, but it doesn't.  I mean, think about it:  Hair outside of your scalp is dead, it doesn't know how long it is, so how can it grow faster if it's shorter?|`|AA11147873	only the ends to be even but like a full haircut you might as well send the hair to locks of love industry because that's only making your shorter.|`|0fc7a2fa9466611e3561df51f2a2fc26aa	just have it trimmed a little so get rid of split or unhealthy ends. otherwise, they'll break off and her hair wont grow as fast.|`|AA10039611	Yes, it makes it healthier and grows better.|`|AA11570136	It is necessary for hair to be trimmed only if there are split ends.

Human hair consists of the hair shaft, which projects from the skin's surface, and the root, a soft thickened bulb at the base of the hair embedded in the skin. The root ends in the hair bulb. The hair bulb sits in a sac-like pit in the skin called the follicle, from which the hair grows.     I have curly hair and am trying to grow it out for my wedding. I got a hair cut in March and havent had a trim since.  Its getting pretty long.  If your daughter has straight hair i would suggest cutting it when it looks like it has a lot a fly aways.      I think the thing with 6 weeks is only if you want to keep your hair that length. If you want your hair to be the same length all the time then you should get it cut every 6 weeks to keep it that length.  If you are growing it out, it will grow no matter if you get it cut 6 weeks or 6 months.  At the bottom of the follicle is the papilla, where hair growth actually takes place. The papilla contains an artery that nourishes the root of the hair. As cells multiply and produce keratin to harden the structure, they're pushed up the follicle and through the skin's surface as a shaft of hair.|`|AA10766589	no trimming dose not have anything to do with hair growth b/c hair is dead getting a hair mask or a deep conditioning or a steam one will keep it healthy they say you should trim it the beginning and end of every season|`|aae6b4f9bac25c96f2878f3aea089451aa	yes - trimming hair keeps it healthy and makes it grow faster.|`|10c425ec94a316e1b108b0c5711e878aaa	`yes because if she has split ends it wont grow|`|a009bafbde87f2b5474962ab70061157aa	try trimming it less and let it grow for longer periods of time. like instead of every six weeks try every nine.|`|6889bb612af1aa0325b12face01202fbaa	ive found that the more often u get your hair cut the quicker it will grow|`|a196053b03e67d93e707474c3cb960c1aa	YES IF YOU TRIM YOUR HAIR IT GROW MUCH MORE.|`|a0f9497cface1ffc6566ca586288039baa	i would trim it evrey 12wk thats what i did with my hair when i was growing it out it worked my hair  grew past my butt

0QyEouddaa	Gee, I don't know much about a mystic tan, but I would wipe it off and accentuate your "whiteness"  It's not a bad thing.  At least you're not tanning and subjecting your skin to all the problems that go with it.  It looked like you were a male.  Haven't you heard??  Guys don't have to worry about all those things like girls do, like the perfect tan, hair, make-up...yuck.  If you ARE a girl, concentrate and making your hair and make-up complinent your beautiful white skin.  I have always been pale, take great care of my skin, am now 36 and still get many compliments on my skin.  Be happy in your own skin darling, it will take a load off!!|`|SNQ22TwSaa	TRY GOING IN THE SUN.|`|AA11665635	I would wipe it off and just apply a bronzer to your face,neck and chest, a bronzer is found in the MAKEUP section and it like a dust you apply!

I use Pysicans Formula brand bronzer and I'm not sure what brand my BIG duster is but you will need to buy a blush BRUSH for the pysicans formula brand and the big duster already has it! It looks great!

c90d4debf808ce54c1abe02cd9119039aa	tip 1 - less chocolate, junk food, sodas, less garlic and powdered seasonings ... more vegetables, fruits and WATER... tons of water (will help with all your skin). My sister had a really bad break out problem and the doctor recommended her a special diet that really helped her  tip 2 - use Dove make-up remover washing clothes. Make it a ritual to wash your face at least 2 times a day, one in the morning and one at night.  tip 3 - if your acne is very bad avoid the make up, it will only clog your pores (I still recommend dove's makeup remover)  tip 4 - many birth control pills help to reduce the acne (if you want to give it a try)  tip 5 - a little suntan will burn some of the acne away (it may cause skin cancer too)  tip 6 - try to relax, stress is really bad for your acne.

A 2005 Harvard study found a connection:    "Acne Associated with Dairy Intake    A new Harvard study links dairy products to adolescent acne. A group of 47,000 women from the Nurses Health Study was asked to provide information about several aspects of their diet during high school as well as any incidence of physician-diagnosed severe teenage acne.     Researchers noted a positive association with total milk and skim milk consumption, along with instant breakfast drinks, sherbet, cottage cheese, and cream cheese.     No association was found with several other foods often thought to affect acne, including soda, french fries, chocolate candy, and pizza.

Some people believe doctors are predisposed to take the easy way to deal with acne prescription drugs. But, with many, this simplistic answer may not be the appropriate course of action. Some feel that such prescription drugs just treat the symposium and not the underlying cause. But, a local dermatologist is still your best starting point.  For me personally, I discovered a great informational acne treatment site. Not only is there good information/articles but I got their audio e-book and following its advice can now say that my acne is a thing of the past! Keep in mind, were all different and there are various types of acne, so what works for some may not be totally effective for all.    Bottom line, hang in there, you will get past this!

cShSwKbyaa	ya um cartilage piercings tend to hurt longer then when you pierce your lower ear lobes...im thinking that since the piercing is new that when you changed it for the first time it just got a little sore...so what i would do is just take a cotton ball or even a piece of toilet paper and use it to squeeze some peroxide on it a couple times a day and remember to twist the earring like twice or three times a day too..that might be why it was bleeding a little is cause you werent twisting it a little bit here and there..if the hurting does not stop after a week or so and it keeps bleeding then put the original earing back in and see if that fixes it..but use the peroxide on it at least a couple times a day to keep it clean and away from infections.|`|9uT2ynx1aa	It's still sore after EIGHT WEEKS?!? After 2 weeks I changed mine. Yours might be infected, if I was you.. I'd get it checked out.|`|MFf2O2ADaa	hey! well i have quite a few cartilage piercings and coming from experience, this is quite normal. the pierced area is just getting used to the new jewellery being inserted into it and it being tampered a little with. What i suggest is to make sure you keep the area clean 4 a few days and try not to touch/knock it anymore and the piercing should be fine. If it starts getting worse (more painful, red/swollen etc) then i suggest you put the original jewellery it was pierced with back in just until it heals then you mite want to try a different type of jewellry that is designed for more sensitive piercings.  A couple of lotions/solutions that you mite want to try, if havent so, that help the area clean is teatree oil or some white meths is just as good. I hope my info helps you in any way and good luck with your piercing :)

I actually got my cartiledge piercing right before my softball game and i wasn't even allowed any piercings!<br>  anyways there are  2 options in terms of piercing it. Using a piercing gun or using a needle. I got mine done using a piercing gun. It is always a risk to using a piercing gun because apparently you can puncture the vein in your ear which can mess up your ear, but there is a 10% chance of that happening and the person doing it will feel your ear first so they would know where to pierce. I think using the needle is the best idea, it might cost more though.<br>  It doesn't get infected easily if you clean it regularly and don't take the earring out after a month.<br>  <br>  hope that helps.

AA11107363	L'Oreal is pretty good, it's thick for good coverage in the shower and leaves hair fairly soft and pretty tangle-free.      For about the same price, though, I would go for Finesse instead.  It's really excellent!  You don't even need to comb your hair when you get out of the shower, your hair so smooth.

b99fe2c9ae92a89a61688b027b1ec0ebaa	I have been a hair stylist for 5 years now.  My best advice is if you aren't sure and don't really want to cut off your hair then don't.  If you are seeking a change then maybe ask for long layers, don't cut your hair off just change the shape of it!  Another good way to achieve a different look would be to add some color.

9125a0bd97a3bf63933709de973fb7d8aa	I have said this before, and I will say it again--it is all OUR fault!    When our boyfriends started showing up in those styles, we should have just told them--"No, SIR! Nuh-uh!! I am NOT going to go out with you looking like that!" And just stuck with it. If a guy wants to date us badly enough, and we all just say no to them looking droopy-butt ugly, then they would start showing up in decent clothes.     Any man I date now has to wear decent clothes. If he shows up at the door to pick me up in droopy-butt pants, I just tell him "We've got enough time to swing by your house so you can change." It doesn't happen more than once with any one guy. They may wear those things when they're hanging with their friends, but they know enough to change before our date.    If more girls demanded this consideration, I betcha it wouldn't be long before the "style" died out!|`|AA11989309	its hot.

Dd5YdYFFaa	Well my eyes are naturally far apart, but I have friends with this also. All you need to do is put a white eyeliner or powder on the corners and insides of your eyes, then take eyeliner and don't line the part of the bottom that is closest to the corner or your eye only about the outside half of the bottom waterline. Also winging out your eyeliner sometimes makes the eyes appear wider.|`|genZbG74aa	Use a white liner or shadow on the inner corners of your eyes, it'll give the illusion of farther apart eyes|`|paP4Sl1Baa	maybe make them look more like a "cat eye"  like this: http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...  http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2007/st...    do you see how they kinda flare their makeup out?

Choose one shade only to use at a time and apply it all over eyes, from lash-line to brows.    Mascara:  Apply one or two coats of clear or brown mascara.

BoBHyKoAaa	The poly-cystic ovary syndrome, causes your hormones to be unbalanced and in turn you have problems with your skin either being combination, or too dry. I have suffered this problem for many years with my complexion as well as others not mentioned.  This is what I have found that works.I got on Ebay and purchased a micro-derm abrasion cloth one of the good ones, I use it all over my body, but mostly on my face to get all of my makeup off and this way I know I did not miss any to cause breakouts, I use  this cloth on my face once per week and very, very lightly to take all of my makeup off.  Once all of my makeup is off or my face is clean, I know this may sound strange but on any breakouts I put a mixture of borax mixed(can get a Wal-Mart) with water that I have let the sediments settle to the bottom and I then put this mixture into a spray bottle and set it by the sink, this kills bacteria on your face and hands that will clear up breakouts and help prevent any further breakouts, let it dry for about thirty minutes, then I apply a thin layer of coconut oil to my face and let it soak in. You can purchace this at any health food store for about six dollars. This will moisturize your skin while you sleep. This has cleared my skin up and now I do not have anymore problems with my skin anyway, the rest I am still battling, but I can look good doing it.  I hope this helps you as much as it did me, I searched for years and tried everything under the sun and nothing but this helped me.  I also take kelp everyday this has helped my harmones stay stabel as well as the rest of my body, you can google it to find out more information about this.  More than likely you have a sluggish thyroid might check this out also, good luck and I wish you the best.|`|qDrhywAWaa	dude can u shorten this up? I would read it if u did that!|`|LiiAhWYEaa	I am a Mary Kay beauty consultant and I would suggest trying Mary Kay if you have not already. We have products that are targeted towards your type of skin. A non wash cleanser is only going to clog your pores more. Think about it this way, When you wash your hands and put the soap on rub it all around and then dont rinse it off. Are your hands really clean? No. All you did was move the dirt around. Plus the soap type ingredient that is in your cleanser will allow more dirt from your day to also stick to your face. It is never actually coming off and out of your pores.     You are welcome to email me any time with any questions you may have.     Try taking a look at this website    www.marykay.com/chunt92106

If there's no way to get rid of it, then try to find ways to make it look not as red. Try going to a store like "bath and body works", and getting a 3 step face cleaner. They may be a little more hygene then what you might be used to, or a little more pampering then you prefer. But trust me, in the long run, it'll be alot better then wearing make-up, or a false beard.    You can also try wearing moisturizing masks at night. When I say mask, I don't mean the green kind that hardens, the kind you see int he movies. They have masks that are clear, green, many different colors, and some of them don't really dri hard. As they dry at night, they crack, so your face has room to move, but it won't come off until it's washed off.    Masks aren't made for just woman now. Men actually have a few better face cleansers then woman do! So don't think that there's anything wrong with a guy wanting to use an atrengent(however you spell it), a toner, and a moisturizer. The mens versions are made for those who want to make their skin look better, feel better, and just have confidence in themselves!    Wish all the best of luck!! I'm wearing my lucky pants, so...........lol|`|6ab573a7d9aa079bcee72f3f1c4203ccaa	Try going to the dermatologist and perhaps he/she can prescribe you with something to clear it.|`|AA10891392	aww..dont get a fake beard.  it'll make your condition worse cuz your skin wont be able to breathe.  i'm sure there's some kind of treatment you can get from a dermatologist.

H1chCcVLaa	MAC is a good choice.    Many people have taken for granted when it comes to this. This is NOT the area you want to be stingy because it could cause breakout, flaky, oily, streaky and patchy after.    You should use cream/liquid- based during Winter but for hot Summer time you should get another powder/matte foundation. For dark circles around the eyes, buy a concealer stick just for that preferably 1-2 tone lighter.    Try it on around your jawline and neck for a start. Dont try on your hands. Use daylight not room light so when you go out even during the day time it will compliment natural lights. Choose the closest color that match your natural skin tone as possible to give natural look.    If you have enough budget...get a primer. It makes you look more natural and your make up stay longer.    Good luck.|`|3DDgXmXVaa	Hey! just like me!  Ive been using BareMinerals for years. IT does come off quickly, and its getting to expensive for my wallet. So just yesterday I went out and bought Loreal Bare Minerals. The reason I did is because I like powders cause theyre easy to match skin tones, and I need to get a pure makeup, like minerals, because my skin is super sensitive to anything and any little thing at all will make it dry and break out-then im at the dermatologist getting prescriptions :(    I was going to buy MAC and I might still but i dont have $$ right now. I did also hear that MAC is really good and not tested on animals!!  If you want a natural look I would try going with the TruBlend collection , i believe its frm covergirl.    I was really interested in trying Physcian's Formula, its organic, but a ton of people said is sucks!    Good luck! ((i would go with mac!)|`|uvITkGeTaa	I would definitely go to Sephora's if you have one located near where you live. There they will match your foundation to your complexion apply it so that you can see how it looks and everything. I personally like makeup forever hd but you get what you think looks best on you.
tBZNoqwiaa	I like a big butt. They are so sexy when they are meaty and jiggly, like kim kardashians ***, but cellulite is disgusting|`|koQ8H19Zaa	as long as its not extreamly big or small we dont mind, also it depends on face, personailty and boobs
yDNv30Okaa	you should leave them for 24 hrs before you get them wet, and just use vaseline, it will stop the itch, but when it scabs dont use anything at all|`|EE8hw8Agaa	After you remove the bandage, you will want to wash your tattoo. Use lukewarm water and mild, liquid antibacterial or antimicrobial soap (Satin and Provon are my highest recommendations. Dial tends to be too harsh - generic brand antibacterial soaps are actually better) to gently wash away any ointment, blood and/or plasma and to completely clean the area. Do not use a washcloth or anything abrasive. Your hand is your best tool in this case. (If your tattoo feels slimy and slippery, you have probably been oozing plasma. Try to gently remove as much of this as possible - when the plasma dries on the skin surface, it creates scabs.)     Then pat (do not rub) the area firmly with a CLEAN towel or paper towel to get it completely dry. Follow with a very light application of your choice of ointment. A&D vitamin enriched ointment would be my first choice, but if you don't have any, Bacitracin or a similar antibacterial ointment is acceptable.     **Do not use Neosporin. This is a wonderful product for cuts and scrapes, but not for tattoos. Some can have an allergic reaction to the Neosporin, which causes little red bumps. When the bumps go away, so does the ink, and you end up with a polka-dotted tattoo.**     Specialty Products and Lotions   If you prefer, you can also use a specialty product such as Tattoo Goo or H2Ocean. It's not necessary, as many over the counter products work just fine, but it's your choice. Use the products as directed as continue for 3-5 days.     After that, continue to keep it clean, but you can use lotion when needed instead of ointment, to keep the skin soft. Whatever lotion you use, it should be dye and fragrance free. A lot of artists recommend Lubriderm, but I have found that Lubriderm stings when I apply it. Instead, I have had great success with Eucerin. See also: Aftercare Contradictions: Why there are so many views on what product is best.     Bathing, Showering, Hot Tubs, and Swimming  Yes, you can (and should!) shower with a new tattoo. It's OK to get your tattoo wet - just don't soak it. Submerging your tattoo in a bath or hot tub can cause serious damage, so you'll want to avoid those for 2-3 weeks, but showering is perfectly fine as long as you don't saturate your tattoo. If you get soap or shampoo on your tattoo, just remove it quickly with water. Swimming - whether it be a pool, fresh water or salt water - should be avoided for at least 2 weeks.     Scabbing and Peeling  After a few days, you will notice some peeling and possibly a little scabbing. Excessive scabbing could indicate a poorly-done tattoo, but a little is sometimes normal and there is no need to panic. Apply warm moist compresses to the scabs for about 5 minutes 2-3 times a day to soften them and they will eventually come off on their own. (Do not apply ointment or lotion to a softened scab - wait for it to dry) You will also start to itch, just like a sunburn when it begins to heal. The advice here is, don't pick, and don't scratch! If the skin itches, slap it. If it is peeling, put lotion on it. And if it is scabbing, just leave it alone. Your tattoo is almost healed, and now is not the time to ruin it!     Protection from the sun  After your tattoo is healed, from now on, you will always want to protect it from the sun's ultraviolet rays. These can fade and damage a brilliant tattoo very fast. Before spending a lot of time in excessive heat, protect your tattoo with a minimum 30SPF sunblock. This will keep your tattoo vibrant for many years, and it will continue to be a source of great pride.|`|L4Bnecwoaa	no way dont have a bath whatever u do! if you soak the skin for too long the ink can come out.  you need to wait at least 24 hours before getting it wet apart from just cleaning it.  i tend to cover mine up with cling film and surgical tape for a few days whilst i shower, then just shower normally but rinse the area to make sure theres no products like shampoo or anything on the tattoo.  but most definatly do not bath until it's healed!|`|HkAK6ZRoaa	congratulation but watch out for cancer with your skin.|`|KC4zFvViaa	Don't go into the bath straight away.    Vaseline works wonders.|`|DUPOEk1daa	Use Aquaphor ointment.  And try not to submerge your tattoos at all through the healing process.  I mean, you can shower (try not to have water falling straight on the tat if possible), but definitely not swimming or baths.|`|IzRq1yRPaa	You shouldn't completely submerge your tattoos in water for around 2 weeks.  As for what to put on it, different people suggest different things.  I use and always suggest antibiotic ointment, neosporin. it works good and is relatively cheap.|`|Rze0frndaa	I agree with Bridget. Personally I use H2ocean and have done for the past 10 or so tattoos. It heals quickly (4-6days) and doesnt stain my sheets or clothes. It soaks into the skin and is not oily. DO NOT USE Vaseline!!! it clogs the pores in your skin as it is petroleum based. If your pores cannot breathe they cannot heal properly and you will get pimples and a rash, unless you have extremely unsensitive skin.    Check out h2ocean.com

Ask other people what their wearing. you don't want to look under-dressed.|`|AA10474060	Depends on the wedding. If it is more informal and outside, I think it would be fine. If it is a formal wedding or a high mass, then you are going to want to wear something a little more formal. One way to find out is to ask one of the bride's maids or look at the venue. Is it in an elegant chapel or a rustic church?|`|GLM0HgvCaa	I have a feeling it's a little too informal.

(Envision the eraser end is at your eyebrow and the sharp end pointing toward your mouth).  If you hold up 2 pencils, one next to each side of your nose, the space in between is the amount you will pluck.  If you have a wide nose and you're afraid you'll be plucking too much, do a small amount at a time and re-examine your brows by standing away from the mirror from time to time and look at your face overall so that you don't pluck too much.  Of course, they will regrow if you over-pluck, but you might get impatient waiting.

Seria muy importante comprares una crema exfoliante (aplicala una vez por semana y nota que los exfoliantes de cuerpo no sirven para la cara), una mascarilla de argila verde (puedes aplicarla en toda cara o solo en la zona T, no la hagas mas que 1 vez cada 15 das) y hay tambin unas bandas de Nivea Visage que se aplican en la zona T y para mi son muy buenas. No uses cualquier tipo de sabon, que puede solo secarte la piel y no quitar el brillo.

De all la recomendacin de visitar peridicamente a un profesional que pueda conocer con certeza las necesidades de nuestra piel y el tratamiento adecuado para volver a recuperar la salud, la frescura y la lozana perdida.    La Cosmetologa es una sucesin de pasos hechos con diferentes cremas que van limpiando la piel del rostro, cuello y escote dejndola libre de impurezas, durante estos pasos se extrae resto de maquillaje, clulas muertas, puntos ******.    Al finalizar con la limpieza se coloca una mscara con los principios activos que la piel necesite.

Personally, i think its okay to splurge on something important like foundation. make sure you don't get a heavy, oily liquid foundation like the MAC ones. they're aweful. my advice would be to get a powder foundation because its light but gives you good coverage. powder also doesnt make you break out. Geurlain is an awesome brand|`|H1chCcVLaa	Many people have taken for granted when it comes to this. This is NOT the area you want to be stingy because it could cause breakout, flaky, oily, streaky and patchy after.    Since you are 14, use the lightest so that it shows your texture and more natural. I will look sweet but sophisticated.    You should use cream/liquid- based during Winter but for hot Summer time you should get another powder/matte foundation. For dark circles around the eyes, buy a concealer stick just for that preferably 1-2 tone lighter.    Try it on around your jawline and neck for a start. Dont try on your hands. Use daylight not room light so when you go out even during the day time it will compliment natural lights.     Finish it with a little blusher and lip gloss.    Good luck.|`|Dzr2ZcdZaa	chanel. its 50 dollars but works well and doesnt make you break out|`|zt70x6NYaa	I use bare minerals and love it.

From what I can tell they actually prefer a natural, blended makeup look.  Soft blended eyeliner and shadow, lightly applied mascara, natural color lip gloss, and invisible foundation/blush.  If they can see the foundation or the makeup rubs off on them they don't like it.  But they do like to get lipstick on them, haha.|`|fb5e6abe0d15467cb8e98fd9cd776d9daa	It's more a matter of how much. A little bit is fine, just to accentuate how the face looks naturally but personally I think any more than that is unattractive, and once it gets to the point where the face is orange and visibly a very different colour from the neck it's just plain ugly. It's a shame that a lot of obviously attractive women go to that extreme, completely oblivious to the fact that it has the opposite effect to what they want.|`|uSJPE4FQaa	Not a guy but Its better to look natuarl Why be caked up in make-up when you have more to that?|`|C7ZlHbJxaa	with

I use either brown or purple. I mostly use purple because it makes your eyes "pop" better. I use a really light purple(it sort of looks white, i put that on to lighten the color, don't put it on if you want it to dark),then I put a light purple(sort of like a lavender) on top of the really light purple,and then put a powder on between your eyes and cheek bones because the eyeshadow flings in between the eyes and cheek bones. Also put the eyeshadow on the eyelid part. P.S. Use a brush that is NOT is not like a "sponge" that comes with the eyeshadow. Use a brush that looks like this:   http://www.eyeslipsface.com/products.asp...   Well Hope I helped!

WiIUEObTaa	miss. old person here. please do not use the lotion the artist gave you. please go to local pharmacy, purchase aloe vera gel unscented. this will heal your art work. no irritation. more colour. the artist gave you the cream for health regulations. aloe vera used for centuries. you also should use unscented soap. the perfume in the soap is harmful to the skin, will irritate. skin. slower healing. skin wrinkle. no offence intended but you are using to much of the cream. go to aloe vera. much faster healing.|`|QSodlfMraa	it could be the type of lotion your using. try a lotion for tattoos.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Yeah obviously everyone will have a different opinion on what to use.    I say *tattoo goo*    Then when it starts to scab *lubriderm scent free*    I have NEVER heard of anyone having a problem with their tattoo after using these products.     I have heard of peoples tattoos getting messed up after using Aloe vera. Then I have heard some say it works great. I have also heard people say they used A&D and it was awesome then some that said it sucked.....    So you will hear that you need to use tons of things.     So I suggest you just use Lubriderm unscented. Its a great lotion almost guaranteed to not harm your tattoo.|`|EE8hw8Agaa	Unsented lubriderm is the best,a thin layer,not alot,just keep it lightly moisturised,you dont want to smother the tattoo|`|kCdISEGqaa	I have a few tattoo specific products I sell at my shop, H2Ocean, Tattoo Goo, and Tat Wax.  They are all great, but I recommend the H2Ocean over them all, it is more of a moisturizer.  The ointments (avoid Vaseline and Neosporin, they can damage your tattoo) are good for the first three or four days, after that, a thin layer of lotion two or three times a day will suffice.  If you put too much lotion on your tattoo, it doesn't soak all the way in, and the top layer of skin becomes "loaded."  The key is to keep the area moist, not wet.  If you are worried, please go back to your artist and have them take a look at it.  Good luck!!!|`|mzXnweedaa	Maybe the lotion you are using is for skin and face only applying it over a tattoo will not make anything better... Look for specially tattoo lotion good luck:)|`|AQcx69GVaa	My bf is a pro tattoo artist, viewed alotta perfect tats get done.. and i have one myself.   Actually its not lotion that yu shud use, its an ointment. shud use 2-3 times a day, for a week or two in some cases, and it should peel untill then.. you could use a wet wipe to gently wipe the surface of the tattoo once a day or so.* emphasise on gently*..    then just try and not keep yur skin dry for another couple of days. To guarantee color perfection.   If there is no visual error i dont think yu messed it up ;)|`|DUPOEk1daa	You can use it 4 to 5 times per day, but make sure it is only a thin layer.  Everyone's body acts different, so don't expect yours to be the same as  your friend's.

P1VoMS36aa	you should have tattoos of meanig only because you will regret something you just got for the sake of it.  tattoos are not a fashion statement.  not trying to sound horrid just don't want you having regrets!  xxxx|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	You have nothing and nobody that means anything to you in your life? Wow, that's nice...    Can I ask how old you are? And can I assume this'd be your first?    You really need to read this back to yourself and hopefully understand how stupid it sounds.     You do realise how much it sucks to regret a tattoo don't you? Well have you done any research into the types of situation in which people grow to regret their tattoos - or have you not bothered and just assumed you're above all that? Well let me tell you, if it helps, 9 times out of ten it's the people that get a tattoo just for the hell of it, that have no appreciation of the art, no sentiment behind the design, and no lengthy period of time spent contemplating and perfecting the design, that grow to regret their tattoos.     Unless, perhaps, you're designing a back piece or sleeve or other layout, and are looking for stuff to fill it out (which I assume is not the case) - to get a random picture tattooed onto yourself, especially with only a fortnight's thought behind it, is just stupid.    Why don't you tell your friend you've grown a brain so won't be getting it done, and if you're still interested in getting tattooed then great, go and do some research, research different styles of body art and at least gain some basic appreciation of what it's about, preferably wait until you have a design with some meaning to you and your life (unless you're the most superficial person alive I really don't believe that your life has no substance at all that you could base a tattoo on), and then get a tattoo in good time when you're ready.    Maybe I sound boring but you'll thank me in the long run.        Edit:   Note to Shoosh - why would you recommend somebody get a religious symbol on their body that they know nothing about? If she needs to look up what the om is then she should not be getting it tattooed on her skin.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Nope....    if you have no idea then you shouldn't get a tattoo.     Just wait until you have something meaningful in mind.|`|w4kdTalPaa	A tatoo should have some meaning to the person. Don't get something  just because.|`|uFJXz1x3aa	well my personal opinion would to get someones name(like a mom or dad) and usually not make it visible(across the chest) i think those are pretty cool...make sure its meaningful or youll regret it|`|YXXvhDLWaa	Here check this out    http://letmegooglethatforyou.com/?q=wher...|`|11TYEOI1aa	get something meaningful or something you really like   never get tattooed under pressure ur most likely to regret it|`|DUPOEk1daa	Do you and your friend have any inside jokes that you could sum up in a simple picture or a word?|`|AQcx69GVaa	Well the first idea i got when i read this was 'the om'    Google the picture of 'om' and read its representation.  'Om written in Sanskrit also represents everything. The material world of the waking state is symbolized by the large lower curve. The deep sleep state is represented by the upper left curve. The dream state, lying between the waking state below and the deep sleep state above, emanates from the confluence of the two. The point and semicircle are separate from the rest and rule the whole. The point represents the turiya state of absolute consciousness. The open semicircle is symbolic of the infinite and the fact that the meaning of the point can not be grasped if one limits oneself to finite thinking.    Yu can always add around the symbol any tribal effects or anything like that to make it look more attractive.|`|TGPqMxuaaa	dont get some one's name|`|rvmj8vVCaa	if it's not gonna mean anything than why get it ?|`|OXOHoISraa	get whatever you want. My artist is great so i go in there and spout out ideas at him and he comes up with something. My advice, if you don't know...go with something traditional. it will never go out of style. Anchors, roses, nautical stars and the like can always be worked into bigger pieces later.
SRJ5HH1Yaa	Mascara and lipgloss sounds good for daily wear, try a clear MAC lipgloss, quite sticky but lasts for ages and give a high gloss finish or else one with a pink tint. As for Mascara black or brown, I like Maybelline but if you have a bigger budget Lancome is excellent! A lil MAC concealer for the days when your skin is not so good, but you seem lucky in that department!    Try brown eyeliner to highlight the brown in your eyes, along with gold and brown eyeshadow with a hint of blue at the ends! Make sure to blend blend blend! Again black or brown mascara, a dusting of bronzer when your skin is tan or a pink blush! If you want a light foundation MAC select gives plenty of coverage but is still light or Stila gives a great glow!  For partying it up, A red lipstick is always dramatic just make sure not to go too wild on your eyes then! Otherwise a swipe of clear or tinted lipgloss should do the trick! Dont be afraid to experiment. Also lots of the make up stores are only to happy to help and often give free testers! Hope this has been a help!|`|FYWYDnnKaa	the better way to know what kind of makeup suits you, you can just go on this site and be member and upload your passport size picture at hiar-skin=make up section and try it. you can also know the names of different makeup colors. so it'd be easy for u to get the colors.|`|BOQxPnjCaa	okaii you didnt tell us what color your hair is  for brown hair you should wear cold colors  like blue green with gold. gold should always  in the inner corner half of your eye && the  cold colors should be on the outer side of your lid  if your black hair, dont use too much red or itll  make you look very pale. avoid red && orange  also for blondes avoid reds && oranged && maybe gold  depends on the shade of gold. this is with eyeshadow   for lipgloss look for a pink shade that matches the  color of blush you were, or your natural blush tone  the lipgloss shade should be a little less brighter then  your blush tone, or plain white clear lipgloss if fine  cuase of you skin tone. && for eyes liner, since you have  thick lashes, you can work the avril lavine eyes were  she colors in her whole lid. with that you can tie your  hair up in a messy bun. it looks hot if you hav long hair  becarefull with mascara cuease after 4 months of it on  every day your lashes fall off badly. avoid curling your   lashes too incase you do. since you already hav thick lashes,   instead of aplying mascara just take your eyeliner && color  on your roots && lashes, it wont hurt a bit. actualy its less   painfull then mascara && it comes off with tissue && a little  warm water. && if your not sure with makeup to were,   i use the mascaras you see on tv brand named. also for  eye liner i were PRESTIGE [[full black pencil]] && revolone EXAGERATE [[twisty pen]] it has a crown on it. these stay on   for a long period of time && is water prook. not to hard to take off  also for eye shadow you should use revolon, topaz and mybeline  have fun painting yer face :D|`|aOsMqwbfaa	Mascara: L'Oreal Telescopic Mascara.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Sorry to hear about your loss.    Firstly, I would forget trying to get a message out in your tattoo. Most people know that suicide is serious, and to get that sort of message across you would need to have something pretty shocking and emotive, and is perhaps not fair on your family to have such a strong reminder displayed in such a noticable place. Also, something visibly linked to suicide might give the wrong impression to future potential employers, and hold you back.    You can set up a website, hand out flyers, give talks in schools, do all sorts of proactive things to get the message out about the harsh reality of suicide. I would save your body art for purely remembering your uncle. Remembering the man he was, not the way he died. Sorry if I'm overstepping the line, of course it's your body with which you can do what you like, this is just my advice. My mum recently died, and she had a drink problem without which she'd still be here, but the tattoo I've had for her has no relation to her illness, it is remembering the wonderful woman I had in my life. I just think it's nicer for you, your family, and your uncle, to commemorate the good parts of him in your tattoo.    I can't really advise you what to get though. The tattoo I had, I chose an angel sitting on her favourite flower and a verse from the poem I read at her funeral. I also have had a seperate tattoo of a verse from her favourite song, the lyrics of which are particularly meaningful. I suggest you find something that was personal to your uncle. It doesn't need to be a big, in-your-face thing. If he was a football fan, you could have a little football. If he liked birdwatching, a little bird or a pair of binoculars. Perhaps a line from his favourite song, or a symbol of his religion. You need to think about something he'd have loved :-)    Good luck with what you choose. Hope you've not taken anything I've said the wrong way, as I said your body totally your choice, those were just my thoughts :-)|`|H3PcFertaa	I too am sorry about your loss.    I agree completely with nked Mama to my Beautiful Boy.  You want to remember the man you cared about more than the method of his death. Who he was to you, and the life that he lived is what should be focused on in your tattoo image.   I would advise that you take some time to remember him as he was in life. If there is a memory of him that makes you smile, then there might be a good subject for your tattoo image. To survive you need to not make the suicide the focus, you need to let it go whether you understand it or not, and overcome it's effects with an image that is free of it. Then you will go forward with your life without dragging the baggage of this tragedy with you.  Take your time, and good luck to you.|`|OXOHoISraa	I think you should get an open wound with stitches tattooed on your wrist. It is a common way of committing suicide and since it is stitched up it is like preventing it maybe?... it seems ironic even, but then i am a big fan of tattoos of stitches. my wedding ring is a tattoo of stitches and an open wound with a heart blood drop on my ring finger. husband has the matcher. I know a guy with his head stitched on. Rad either way

H3PcFertaa	1st let me address alwaysme.. & rudedood, If you don't like tattoos, please keep it to yourselves, and visit the other sections that you like.  And your opinions based on your teenage life about tattoos on anyone older than you, are hardly accurate. You are just showing how immature you are, and how afraid you are of growing up and growing old.  There's a lot of life to be lived, past the viewpoint of the under 21 crowd.    Now as far as an answer to your question, CassieS2..., (and I apologize for the above being within your answer) ...  You could have an Armenian flag:  http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumb_130/1...  http://www.jdemirdjian.com/images/Armeni...  Here's ancient Armenian ornaments , any of which would translate well in a tattoo:  http://www.angelfire.com/hi/Azgaser/symb...  As far as anything written in Armenian, I cannot help you with that. My advise concerning letters and words is to keep it short and simple, use a beautiful script, and know that letters should be no smaller than 1/2" with good skin space around them.  Also, if you have your wrist tattoo placed a little further (towards the elbow ) past the wrinkly place next to your palm, you will have a much easier time healing your tattoo. And you can easily cover it with a long sleeve top if you want to.  good luck~|`|RdlR9Hwwaa	don't by the time you are 60 you will regret it....|`|rvmj8vVCaa	tattoos pretty stupid.  just get a sharpie, draw what you want,  and the next day you can have something  different in the same place... no regrets cause it's washable.  tattoos are forever.    and let me tell you, old people(50-60+) look so stupid  with flames up their arms, all saggy and it looks like a big blob of colors? believe me, they regret it and you most likely will too.  not trying to be mean, but the truth hurts.    please think before you do it.      now if it's like your parents name or something very important to you, then it's okay cause it will have a special meaning. but like a flames or the devil. no not good.|`|P1VoMS36aa	it sounds like you already have a great idea, if it means something to you, go for it!   i don't know any armenian so can't help you there! sorry   Good luck   xxxx|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	One that means something to you.
ade60a82747a7419784d380017a2a656aa	yeah you look a lot alike!    just a few tips tho::  1.) black seems to look nice on both of you  2.) please.. part your hair to one side. parting your hair in the middle makes you look like a kindergartener, which isn't what we're aiming for here are we?  3.) straighten or curl your hair.. it would look gorgeous either way;; both of you have shiny, healthy hair  4.) black heels are fashinable and the most sensible. black shoes go with anything and everything. (unless if you're going to wear a dress. then match the shoes to the dress)      well yeah.. good luck, have fun!  =]    EDIT: i just had an idea...  you could wear black dresses with shiny red heels, and a red headband with a big red bow. then carry little red purses/clutches with black hearts on them.   sorry if the idea disgusts you!|`|rcV7Cmq8aa	yeah u both  look exactly like each other mustly|`|E6W5TRZKaa	You do look like sisters.

aSuLnvoSaa	Ive known someone who has done it,     and it looked fine, as long as it wasnt bleach blonde and a natural honey color...        btw, if this is you, BE AWARE OF ROOTS. they look soooo tacky s (especially when you have dark hair and you dye it blonde) you either want to keep on dying and dying and dying or using root touch up...|`|CcTVp28Paa	I have naturally dirty blonde hair, but my friend went from blonde to black, then back to blonde.  If you have dark hair, don't go straight to blonde, lighten your hair and do it in stages.  It will come out better that way.  Good luck :)|`|g2h6cgcvaa	hmm keep in mind you will get dark regrowth and it might  not be a good look.
JgYFL693aa	MAC Pro is the site for the people who have Pro Membership. Basically, the Pro program allows professionals in the industry to join and get special discounts, products/colors, and access to artistry classes and industry events. It's really cool. So some of the colors on the MAC Pro site are going to be different than the ones on the consumer site. I don't think you can order from the Pro site unless you're a member, but you can go to any Pro store and buy the colors there, without a membership. So the product is the same, but on the Pro website there are more colors/finishes. Hope I helped.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	the second one is multi purpose      and the first is shadow.      the gray words with a : following, look at em|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Same product.
6YwLlYovaa	MAC PRO is an extension of the regular MAC line. MAC products are made for use by the general public, while PRO products were designed for use by make-up artists (pros.) PRO stores stock all the regular MAC products, and also all of the PRO products, while regular MAC stores and counters only stock the regular products. there are far fewer MAC PRO stores around then there are MAC stores and counters.  PRO products are often brighter than regular MAC products, as many of them are designed specifically for use in photography and film.     you don't have to be a make-up artist to enter a PRO store and purchase PRO products, anyone is allowed to do that. however in order to order products online and to get a discount you have to be a member. you do need to be a make-up artist in order to get a PRO membership.     you can still order PRO products without going to a PRO store and without being a make-up artist. if you call this number (800) 387-6707, ext. 8555 or (905) 470-7877, ext. 8555 you can order the products by phone.  hope this helps you.

Sv9SQqyoaa	its really your call but i think   you should give him one last chance  smoking is really really hard to quit  but i feel the ame way as you about it   because i watched but grandpa suffer  and slowly slip away from lung cancer too  but at least he is trying   i think if you do give him another chance,  keep it at that, just one  but tell him to tell you the truth about it   i think if he smokes but he comes to you   and tells you he did it it is better  than him lying to you   and having someone else come and tell you  that he smoked. i dont have any personal experience  with smoking itself or any sort of nicotene addiction  but i know its really really hard  and i dont think he can just stop cold turkey   (lol funny saying.. sry :P)  because some of my friends have had the same problem  and they could stop weed but smoking for them  was really really really hard  and it took them a while to stop it  just tell him you can never be with him if he keeps smoking  and you can make up with him   and ask him to be your bf again  but if he lies to you one more time  (not smoke, because it will take him a while, but lie to you about it)  then break it off right then and there  and dont get together with him again  you obviously have really stong feelings for him  and you want to be with him   so i think this is the best way :)|`|byHh0A3Eaa	omg you sound more like his mom than his gf|`|UlrvomV5aa	quitting smoking would be hard. Tell him that if you catch him smoking one more time its it forever.|`|MwvA8v17aa	think of it this way:  he obviously doesnt love you more than anything if he's not going to give  up smoking & his bad habits for you  his love for smoking is obivously stronger;  you can do much better|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	I think you did the right thing,  but people in Singles & Dating might  be able to help you out more than people  in Beauty & Style.    If it makes you feel any better, I would've  done the same thing.    I guess my advice to you is to not make  a big deal about it. Don't spread it around  school, act mopey or depressed, or tell people  details about your relationship and why you  broke up. That'd make a bigger deal of things  than need be.    You've given him chances already. It's up  to you, not your friends. If you want to give him  another chance then that's your choice, I'm not  going to tell you what you should do with your  life.    Smoking is a disgusting habit and lying about  it makes it even worse.|`|k07IyDvwaa	i dont think u should be sure he wont smoke anymore, you should give him another chance because if he does it again and again and he keeps on hurting you, what will you do next! tell him to choose between his addiction and u, if he really loves you then he'll chose u|`|07qFHL6iaa	ok. I must say, that is a pretty sad story. If i were you i'd dump him. But im not actually you and im not feeling your pain.   There are a lot of worthy guys out there, you just have to open your heart to them. And there are still those guys that you love, but broke your heart. If he's a liar, then he's probably not the right guy for you. But he made a change for you and that's still great. (food for thought)   Ok, so what you should do is sit him down, tell him your story and how you feel. Tell him you'll give him one last chance, and that if he can't make the full transition, then he doesn't love you. Tell him that your grandfather died, and that you love him so you need him to stop. Or what you can do is stay friends and keep looking for someone. I hope you solve the problem. Good luck!|`|qoKvIsBYaa	In order for HIM to love YOU, HE has to first love himself!  If you haven't already explained the reasons you don't like smoking to your bf do so.

I fyou can learn to live with them stay with him, however if it is just too much dump him, I dumped my ex for similar reasons, I couldn't take the lying and the smoking and all that.  Btw, u may want to ask this under singles and dating, not beauty and style.      (=|`|yqgjjwbqaa	he sounds like every other guy says heloves you and he'll stopand he never does get rid of the loser!!!!!!!!!!! :(|`|eUiMXcFcaa	As much as you love each other, going on like that simply will not work.  He has a habit that he will not give up for you, so it makes him lie to you.  You hate that habit so much that it's making you super controlling over him.  It sounds like you disagree so much on this issue that neither of you is going to change.  Tell him that it's not that you want him to quit, it's that you have made the personal decision not to be with anyone who smokes.  If he decides he wants to be with you, he will change on his own.  If not, it isn't a healthy relationship for either of you.|`|AA11634944	Why do women have this idea that they can change a man? I'm sorry, but he's not going to change for you, the only time he will change is if he truly wants too. Either accept him for who he is and hope that one day he will decide that he wants to stop, risking the chance that he will probably never change. Or do the smart thing and just cut your ties and move on. You may feel bad but you have already decided that you can't be with someone who smokes.    Take it from someone who has dated a complusive liar. For some people love has NOTHING to do with it. They may claim to love you (and they might actually feel that way) but it won't make a difference. Trust me. Just move on before you get in even deeper.|`|c395f9b923e5867e12ec729455cee920aa	I wanna tell you to stay with him because you love him, but why stay with a guy that isn't gonna keep his word? You gave him plenty of opportunities and he took them for granted. Love is one of those complicated things. If you say you love him THAT  much HELP HIM! It is an addiction and it just cannot be done over night. If not give your relationship a break meet new people... see what other guys are out there. That's the same thing two of my close friends that went out for a year are doing and I think that each other is better off as friends.|`|mxVq4mOeaa	... you cant just quit smoking like thta. its hard to.. have you seen him making an effot to? i say give him another chance. and dont let him be incharge.. let him know that you WILL breakup with him for good if he smokes.. or at least tires to quit. you guys only went out for 3 months.. see how it goes|`|ezPTRG8jaa	send him to rehab|`|2ZQYzuzqaa	i feel your pain. if i was you i would give him another chance. it might be hard for him, but dont let him off so easily.. make me see and know that it means a lot to you and hopefully he stops for the better of both of you..if not let him go.. but still be there for him as a friend.. and try to help him quit.|`|3cRcz9Kmaa	EAT SOME CHAZ IT TAKES THE PAIN AWAYYYYY!!!|`|f3LqEOv9aa	dont,  you cant always give people a billion chances,  at least take a break from him,  so he can learn not to,  if you take him back every time,  hell learn to get away  with it.

He might be the only man for you and if after you have thought this through clearley and u still love him then try again as a fresh start but this time ... Take him to see someone who can help you with these kind of things there are people that help people like him give up these awful adictions, the trouble is he has done it 4 so long he might not find it the easiest thing to do!

I know its not what you want to hear but its the honest truth. I've been in a similar situation|`|t0mb150gaa	For one thing no one should try to change the other person that is not what relationships are about..so if you are so against the things he does then do not go back to him. Another thing not taking your a.d.d medication does not make you smoke pot and cigarettes that is just an excuse and a lame one at that. If you want to stay with him then why don't you help him get through quitting instead of demanding it but from my perspective you two do not belong together in the first place because you obviously have different perspectives of life and what you want out of it. Noone can change a person no matter how hard they try and if it was truly love you wouldn't want to.
9oTQpf3daa	some it will some it wont, but i think that you should probably ask your females friends if it bothers them, chances are it wont, have a good look around the next time your out and you will see that,a lot of people have moles and still have girl or boyfriends, if your really concerned you can get it removed but that can be fairly costly, you could also see your doctor you may be able to get it removed for free,if your really unsure of someones reaction to you, try smiling before you go over to them,you can judge their reaction from that,but even if you are rejected it may have nothing to with your mole.|`|NOz2NIMTaa	It really depends on the size.|`|TJTB6PJhaa	Um, yeah, it annoys me.  But hey, you can always get rid of it. Go to a dermatologist and you can have it surgically removed.|`|gpeOH11Daa	no they have never bothered me. but it if it does bother you, go see a doctor and tell him/her you are concerned about the mole. they will remove and have it tested. then you wont have it anymore.|`|d6k5pPMoaa	unless ur really hot like enrique iglesias  who has a mole  than its not problem  but if ur ugly than sorry but yea its gross u mite wna get it removed|`|7ZtB526Haa	Some are yes--depends on how silly they are!!because this worries you--consult plastic sugeon have it removed!! Sometimes they can become troublesome too!!!Good luck--Your Dr can refer you!!!|`|Psk3UsQKaa	personally I like a guy that doesn't worry about his looks because I don't worry about a guys looks.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	Do you have the design? Some artists charge a little extra if you want their help to create the design, but if you have it ready and printed/drawn out then you're set to go - most artists charge by the hour but all their rates differ, mine charges 60 an hour (in theory anyway - he usually knocks it down a bit) which would usually be about $120 I think? But as I say it totally depends on the artist, that's about average I'd say. And 2x2 (do you mean inches or cm?) would take no longer than half an hour I expect, which'd make it about 30 in my studio, but some artists have a minimum amount so you may have to pay a minimum 40 charge even if the design only took a few minutes to ink.    Anyway, that's the average sort of price you'd be looking at, a tattoo that size won't break the bank so if I were you I'd take it into the artist of your choice (choose wisely!) and go from there! Good luck!      Edit: Just a tip, if you meant 2x2cm then you might need to either enlarge it or simplify it slightly, as the edges are quite intricate, and even if the artist will do it, they'll without a doubt go pretty blurry over the years and lose that nice effect. If you were talking inches then you'll prob be fine xx|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	It all depends on what it is....What are you getting a tattoo of?    Usually something that small they won't charge by the hour because it wont take an hour.       ::guess::    $40 - $135|`|YXXvhDLWaa	Depends on how much detail is in the tattoo. Most shops charge anywhere from $100 to $200 an hour|`|HCMrR1O9aa	well, for a 2x2 that has no color i would prob. say about 60 bucks, but i live in southern texas, and their are alot of parlors around, but alot of places will charge $100 an hour, and rate the price off of that, like if it only takes 30min, it would be like 50 bucks......lol, i have four tattoo's and that is what i have paid for most of them, some shops will not do it by hour, but by size and detail and colors....they'll give you a price if you just ask, (they love poppin your tatto cherry, so dont feel embarassed, they want to help ya!!!)|`|XxU94aKlaa	How much does a blue shirt cost? A small green one? Same idea here- No one is going to be able to tell you.  Tattoo artists charge based on different criteria parlor to parlor. Some charge based on time spent tattooing, some based on the difficulty of the design, some on color, size, and so on. Many have a shop minimum as well. It's going to vary between every artist you speak to.  Best thing you can do is take a copy of the concept to the artist you plan on doing the tattoo and asking him or her for an estimate.  Also keep in mind- "Good tattoos are not cheap, and cheap tattoos are not good"|`|P1VoMS36aa	if your showing that pic to the tattooist and he/she copies it,its not custom.  but it will prob cost 60-100|`|OXOHoISraa	most of the best shops here charge around $120 an hour regularly and the shop minimums are usually around $60-75. I would assume you are paying the shop minimum unless it is very detailed.  Don't forget to add a good 20%+ tip to that if you are happy.

lPCjNkEnaa	You can't get rid of a zit in one day.     But here are ways to help you diminish it's appearance:  NEOSPORIN: It kills bacteria, speeds the healing of wounds, and can minimize the appearance of small scars. Neosporins combination of Bacitracin, Neomycin, and Polymixin-B kills a broad range of bacteria beyond the typical acne treatments such as benzoyl peroxide. Also, unlike BP, Neosporin is unlikely to cause drying since it uses an oil base (something that acne sufferers typically try to avoid - however, its actually the oil underneath the surface that your glands produce which is more likely to become a barrier to clear skin). It also causes reduction of redness makes spots less obvious.     Use Neosporin on stubborn whiteheads, pimples, and/or scars overnight to help clear and heal skin.     MAKE UP:  Conceal Breakouts    Step 1  Use a concealer specifically formulated both to cover and to treat blemishes. You want something drier than an under eye concealer, which is usually quite creamy. A treatment concealer or an oil-free stick foundation will stay on the trouble spot without migrating.    Step 2  Whether you use your finger or a concealer brush, the key is concentrating the pigment right on the pimple. Gently tap the product onto the blemish, if you wipe or rub it on, you won't get the concealer where it needs to be.    Step 3  Use a sponge to dab a tiny bit of powder (in a moisture-rich formula) onto the spot you're trying to hide. Follow this with a light dusting of powder over the entire face to set your makeup. Be careful not to apply too much to already dried-out skin. Drier skin plus breakouts may mean you're being too aggressive with your skin.

Nothing works that fast  Yes, toothpaste does work but it can leave a red spot and a dry itchy patch. It's not very good for your skin and it doesn't work very fast.    Try this routine. Half my acne was gone overnight    -first stop popping pimples. This can leave scars and even make pimples worse.  -get a good toner, acne scrub and acne spot treatment.   I suggest to get this all in neautrogena. It works the fastest.     -first, wet a wash cloth with warm to hot water and leave it on you face for five  minutes. The hot water opens your pores and let's the medication get deep down into your pores.    - now wet your face with warm water so that your pores stay open. Now get your acne scrub and massage it on your face and rince    -next get a toner and either spray it on your face or pour it on a cotton ball and rub it on your face. Let it airdry    -next get an acne spot treatment and put it on your worst zits     -this will help it go away and fast. Not all the zits will be gone by tonight  so get a concealer with an invisible green tint. The green will tone out all the red of the pimples and you can't even see the green.    -use this routine every night ebb when your acne is gone and your acne will be gone and stay gone.|`|ml18bPFCaa	Go to the store and buy some proactive! it works REALLY fast and good! And makeup ;)|`|PCs1BRrxaa	toothpaste never worked for me|`|y05dLJfYaa	Um.  You could try popping it, then cover up with a bit of makeup lol.  Toothpaste does work, but I think it dries your skin.|`|8eCVHHbQaa	tooth paste works really well. it drys out the zit, so be sure to put it directly on the zit and not on your skin. i don't think you'll be able to get rid of the zit by tonight so put on some cover up, but the kind that doesn't clog pours  (i think cover girl has some) good luck!|`|NYBo35zjaa	People don't believe me when I say this until they try it themselves, then I'm not so crazy, ever seen "My Big Fat Greek Wedding"?, Windex it works|`|uFJXz1x3aa	pop it, put rubbing alcohol,, and then put a tiny piece of toilet paper on it like guys do after they shave...leave the tiny paper on for about 15 minutes, then take it off and leave the zit alone....at night you can put make up on it and itll look like it was never there ;]
hrrgpaV8aa	I'd say your a person with many friends.   I came to that conclusion because you are always smiling.  Also, I'd say you are pretty outgoing judging by the crazy picture.  Which is awesome! That means you are fun to be around.   Kudos to you! =)|`|6EPedq48aa	id say maybe a inbetween? not nerdy ut not popular. ud look cute with ur hair down by the way,, :) and the maines playing at my local highschool.......... for prom!|`|eDP3YU5Laa	I think you look pretty girlieh prepiesh.  i think you should straighten ur  hair i garanty it will look  much nicer.|`|eba7fefdf839622869be8b19d9b9ca2baa	Your looking at the computer on the third one!  :D      Your a cutie.|`|F0uLexezaa	u r very cute and look like a lot of fun to b with|`|ddRs5zfhaa	Your pretty.  I dunno you look like yourself.  Labels are so lame.|`|8hjQRB7Aaa	15/16 x|`|HYV1qzktaa	5.9?|`|nntQUfl1aa	u look average, or maybe the type who's friends with everybody. u don't look like ur in the party crowd because ur not wearing 7 tons of makeup.|`|OAjaEI8Oaa	your very pretty!!|`|S1J0u3zoaa	You look pretty,  like you can dress up and look STUNNING, or dress down and look average. But you are pretty, and natural looking.  You have really natural looking blue eyes, and gorgeous blonde hair.   These are all complements haha|`|WGFtXo6Paa	First, you a re so gorgeous. You don't need to cover your face with makeup. As for the label, it's really hard to guess. Since you like the Maine, I would put you in a label with people that like that type of music, but you don't look like that. I would say your just an average straight-edge girl that does great in school but still has lots of friends.    And btw, I'm going to see The Maine w/ We The Kings, The Cab, and Versa Emerge on March 1st. Love that band.|`|024Pu2XRaa	Very nice. I'd even say beautiful|`|eOBYBAG6aa	em plastic ?   i dont mean it in a bad way like you know those popular girls yeah i dont have that in my school * thank god * so i dont know what you call them but i guess you'd be one of them ! haha|`|nD9Dmwqbaa	I would give you awesome. hehe.... the maine is awesome =]|`|WOm4VcTaaa	I think your probably the funloving person and everyone likes you. No joke|`|cINoLQMLaa	cute, but you look like your 10-12|`|55d7e5fbbf85991efc1fb24ea6b9735faa	oh your 17! had no idea but you look pretty and natural|`|7P83eUREaa	ok firstly, PLEASE don't start wearing a ton of makeup, you are SUCH  a natural beauty. I reckon you are really fun to be with and have loads of true friends, also the a good listener. And very independent and funny, never boring. sporty?! I love you already!
accdd753250739a255f532616b8c6cdfaa	It isn't the size of the barbel, it's the fact that it is there is  what causes the problems.  You may like the look of it, but is it really worth the thought of having your teeth redone.  Not trying to sound like an old adult, but I did look into it, and I didn''t like what I heard from my dentist.  Be Smart!!!|`|AA11027952	i jus gat muh tung pierc an it rerry rerry hurz!!!!|`|qDgvK3IFaa	yeah|`|DozD8lTGaa	well i know people with the normal sized bars and their teeth are fine... i heard about this teeth business - and it ******* them up. but, how does that happen? :S:S:S    some people have theirs done 3 or 4 times and theirs nothing wrong with their teeth. but, i think you would be better talking to the body piercer itself because, they know best.    when i got my wrist pierced the man asked do i know about rejection and stuff like that (not that the tongue rejects - just example) but, they should run you through... if they don't - just ask.    good luck though!! xx|`|yjvBnW71aa	dnt do it ppl i no hav their tung pierced and it bleed nonstop and gets infected and hurts ALOT|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Yeah, just get 4mm or 5mm barbel. I do wear it all the time.|`|eGd228c0aa	Yes, and it may take forever to stop bleeding.
OsHjXzxUaa	i guess, but they do sell sea salt scrubs and things. i would just get that. u can find it at CVS or walmart or any of those kinds of stores :)|`|bAmpR3Exaa	i thought it was the cholrine got rid of acne.. so im not sure if that would work..|`|E7vuPi9uaa	yea it'd work, its the same salt water.  But I'd suggest asking your doctor, they have great treatments for acne that work just like the drying of salt water
mrdfwEAjaa	clean & clear.  but i find that using the same kind for a while stops working. so buy both and change the type you use every week. it will work (:|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	I use neutrogena and i have acne. I use it and  so i think it works the best. Ive tried other brands like clean and clear but i like neutrogena much much wayyy better!!|`|78aBwPooaa	Neutrogena. Clean&Clear is a waste of money! (:
A7ovwP94aa	I love Loreal Telescopic for length. I have short sparse eyelahes and I absolutely adore it. Another mascara that I am yet to try is Clinique Long Pretty Lashes.    Lancome mascaras are fantastic Definicil is good and L'Extreme is suppose to be also good. In fact all Lancme mascaras are good just a bit pricey.|`|sjSJ0mgoaa	Try Telescopic.  the brush is very good if you don't want any clumps. :]|`|cHUJ3Xc7aa	try FantasticLash  it worked well 4 me|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	I use Cover Girl waterproof. It seems to work well for me. It's never given me any clumping problems.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Cover Girl Lash Exact, Almay Intense-I-Color Play Up Collections mascara, Cover Girl Exact Eyelights, any mascara with those brushes won't clump. Also, you could try Maybelline Full N Soft, or Neutrogena Healthy Volume.|`|WkAi9NV0aa	Maybelline Define-A-Lash!|`|iYL37RfPaa	Really most mascaras are clump free if you put it on properly,  if you put loads of coats on, then no matter what mascara you have it will go clumpy,  if you only put like 2 coats on it won't go clumpy!!    xo
QnSKaBcjaa	hard to tell but id say curvy.and i mean it in a good way, not code for fat. i like that body.|`|vnOz03Aaaa	curvy yet slender.|`|VCSLSwmLaa	umm..  FASHOINABLe..  i guess..|`|LoOBJ6RTaa	You can't see the body shape because she's wearing a jacket.|`|TJTB6PJhaa	Curvy  At least from the bottom.|`|Zeeyjd8Laa	Perfect =) not fat, not thin... very sexy too|`|zPXESVieaa	a good one! hhah .. how do u do ur hair like that? its soo cute|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	perfect!|`|XR2BCYOSaa	cute !|`|NBf5q2f5aa	hour glass|`|wyCJ365oaa	Slender?

x7kg6x7Vaa	it can ruin your skin if you don't use proper make up wipes to wipe it off before you go to bed; every time you don't take off your make up before you go to bed it ages you by 4 days, also if you are allergic to alot of things like hair dye then you should use hypoallergenic makeup in case you are allergic to it which will also age you.    anyway if your friends say you look great without makeup then you probably do so dont worry about it, only wear it for special occasions    lastly remember less is more|`|2r1WN0Hgaa	yes it does i wouldn't say that it ruins it but it does age it. but you don't have to wear it all the time. In fact, you don't have to wear it at all!! just because everyone else is wearing it don't mean that you have to do it as well. As long as your happy with the way you look then you know..!I think people who wear a lot of make up have a low self esteem or just not happy with the way they are(me). But a little bit won't hurt. but hey, if your friends tell ya that you look great then there ain't no pressure. When I first started wearing make up it got very addictive so beware lol.|`|XuiknMQ8aa	I wouldn't say that wearing make up would ruin your skin. Just make sure to remove your makeup before bed and moisturise esp. if you are using foundation/powder.  I know that when I'm lazy with taking my make up off my skin really suffers.|`|cvZ0cXzlaa	like no like it doesnt|`|XQhVFCLyaa	It shouldn't do any harm to your skin as long as you take it off properly every night|`|kgTMQixaaa	No, at least I don't find it does.  But still, if you're not sure, then you should just wear Lip gloss until you want to do it.|`|j4rirb8laa	If you wear too much make up. Think about (1) having to take it off each night. (2) what does the boy friend think when he sees you without it.|`|7n4rtfp6aa	ofcourse it does:) I mean foundation and all. They block the pores and that's how you get spots and etc:) It's not worth it really, i used to put makeup on because i had spots and now that i stopped, spots have disapeared lol who would've thought :)|`|ZmU6ZNhBaa	Yes it does.|`|haNSPFR5aa	If you don't wash it out everynight YES|`|l5Q8lq35aa	Not at all; just make sure to take your make-up off at night  and switch make-up remover wipes everyday to avoid bacteria.  Also buy make-up that is oil-free so it won't clog your pores (things  like concealer and foundation). But I wouldn't use foundation and  base since you really don't need it at that age.     Just go with the eye make-up and lip color and you're good.  But to answer your question; make-up is completely safe.  Good luck, and have fun with it! :-).|`|MVdbt4Esaa	wearing make up can make you break out a little if your allergic to an ingredient or someting   but it doesnt ruin your skin  just make sure to wash your face before bed so you don't break out|`|cYsPx9sSaa	i heard it just ages it|`|GBy0W2YEaa	if yhou leave it on at night it age's you but not if you look after your skin like wash it off every night and moisteriser|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Foundation can make your skin bad (but it doesnt to everyone).... the sun is more the cause of aged skin.    If you dont wear make up why not just start wearing suttle make up like mascara and eye liner or lip gloss.    I wouldnt start plastering on foundation like a lot of girls your age do as some of them look soooo cakey!    X|`|8eRMjkcJaa	If you get a nice brand of make up, and you wash it all off before bed, then no it won't ruin your skin.|`|DlMsJPwUaa	Some brands like MAC do but ones like Bare Essentials are natural and wont do that.|`|4x5ajsUpaa	It can clog up your pores and cause blackheads and spots and can also make your skin dry.|`|7NiFxZ3faa	You could wear makeups made of natural ingredients and wash it off every night, then it should be fine.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	good job on not wearing makeup.. wow.. and yah it does ruin your skin. i try not wear a lot of it cuz it actauul does, like you wont see the differeve rite now but later in life your gonna be ugly...|`|qDgvK3IFaa	no it doesn't|`|0nnh29Nxaa	well i think you should experiment with little makeup. and not all makeup ruins your skin like mineral makeup or organic.  but remember makeup doesnt look good on everyone.|`|rPWYuGklaa	kind of ruin your skin? look at some of the testimony online of women who bathed in the sun their whole lives, and wore makeup forever. it will change your life, and you won't be wrinkly and nasty when your older :)|`|1rlFqcVbaa	No.  As long as you don't "cake" on the make up, it is fine. Just wash your face each night with a good moisturizer and that will help with the quality of your skin.     If you ever decide to wear make up, I recommend that you use a light mineral based powder, not a foundation. If you do use a foundation, than make sure and use a light liquid based. And try dipping the sponge you are applying it with in a moisturizer. :)  Hope I helped.
1ndsZlU6aa	I asked this question to a stranger once. Turned out she was a skincare expert who's been all over the world to different skincare product conventions. She said never use Clinique, its the devil of the skincare world, its like paint stripper. If its blackheads and spots youre trying to get rid of, she reccommends using grapeseed oil and salt. Make the mix up yourself. You can find grapeseed oil at the cooking oil section in the supermarket. Salt is cylindrical so it will roll neatly into your pores and back out again, pulling oil and dirt out with it. Whereas if you buy a face scrub, the grains are not cylindrical and will scratch your face and clog your pores, doing you more damage than you started off with.|`|igrdohopaa	Apricot Face Scrub (= Works beautifully|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Use a steamer, or if you don't have one, boil some water and put your face over it for a few minutes with a towel over your head. That opens you pores for you.  To close them again, you need to splash your face with some cold water otherwise you will get more.    To prevent them, use a daily cleanser and if you use warm water to wash your face with, again splash it with cold water otherwise, when you moisturize your pores will be open and this will lead to more spots.|`|2QiLmXfhaa	Clear and clear blackhead daily clearing scrub worked for me 1st day then it just... didn't work anymore.  Its so annoying I no.   How bout using warm water then rubbing brown sugar in, then splashing clean with warm water then cold. I don't no if itr works though. Sorry. :D    Xxx|`|vVlD8rYqaa	Boots crushed apricot seeds scrub from boots about 3.90  Tea tree scrub from the body shop    And one for dead sin  f c u k sugar scrub    I would recommend the tea tree one     Good luck|`|S730dpLfaa	Amie, if you're serious,read this blog before taking any action  http://ihateblackheads.wordpress.com  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best method.  Hope this helps|`|5EfJu34taa	black head removal strip.you get it in every chemist shop.just ask them for one.|`|a4564058652e362fab9611e989e45b00aa	I use this Japanese product, I'm not sure if you'll be able to find it.  It is called Pore Peeling Tsururi and you rub it on your nose and it is a sort of rough cream that rubs the blackheads off.  Here is a picture:  http://www.adambeauty.com/showitem.php?i...|`|ac66baf81b3d3c1b7bd6b0c9a8da605caa	I wouldn't waste your time using over the counter stuff - getting something on prescription will be much more effective    I use Isotrex - takes a few week before you see a difference but for me it has made a huge difference    good luck :)      I have heard that mandelic acid is good but I haven't used it myself
XxU94aKlaa	No because my father went with me when I got my first, and now that I am an adult they have no say in it. They know about it, they aren't huge fans of it, but they do understand that I'm an adult and it is my discussion.  If you need to hide your tattoo from your parents and are asking online on advice on how to do so than you are not old enough for a tattoo yet.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Yes and no haha - I waited until I was legal before I had my first tattoo, and I showed my parents when I got that, who naturally disapproved! I've told them about each and every one I've had since, but I've had a few quite recently since my mum died and my dad flipped out the other week and he thinks I'm doing it because of my grief, which is true for some of them but not for others, I loved tattoos before and had always planned to build up a back piece and work on my arms, but yeah anyway - long story short despite the fact I'm 21 and have a son of my own, I am in fact hiding my most recent one from him! It's a big ring of words about a foot in diametre (maybe slightly less) on my upper back, going around another big tattoo I already had in the middle. Going to wait until summer before I reveal that one! He's going to kill me when I get the next one on my arm in a few weeks! One of life's many lessons - parents don't go easy on you once you hit adulthood - you're always their baby!|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	I did.  I was 18 but still living with my parents.  It was the summer before college and i kept it hidden until they dropped me off at college.  I was so scared they wouldn't let me go if they found out I had a tattoo!  It was on my shoulder blade so easy to hide as long as i didn't wear tank tops.|`|YXXvhDLWaa	No because I waited till I was an adult before I got a tattoo and it didn't matter what my parents said.     Believe me you cannot hide anything from your parents they always find out|`|BKTx9IsZaa	clohting long sleeves  turtleneck hair adjusted|`|5RoYyprkaa	mine's on my hip. my parents have no idea. and i've had it for seveal months now. even though i'm legally able to get them, my parents don't like tattoos, so i don't get tattoos that are visible to appease them for now. what they don't know won't hurt them.|`|uUHMg5Szaa	nope because I don't have a tattoo, I am 14 so if I do get one I will wait till' I am 18|`|8to6MsWuaa	Nope, i don't think i will ever get a tattoo. Everyone that i've talked to says they regret their decision. If I was to get one I would probably get one on my ankle, and not a butterfly or anything like that.|`|2Ol0i5fqaa	Yeah and i managed to hid it for a week!    It's on my lower back and when i came home drunk one night i fell up the stairs where my mum was standing behind me, she saw it, i told her it was temporary but she obviously knew, mothers instinct and all.    About 2-3 weeks after this she continued to ask me about it, so eventually i just told her the truth, she was surprisingly alright with it :)|`|P1VoMS36aa	no because im an adult.  it wasn't something i rushed into,iv got no silly fashionable tats. all mine have meaning.  xxxx|`|5PQd5gSQaa	I hid them because i knew my parents wouldn't like them, but i do not regret the tattoos one bit. first one is on my ribs, and was pretty easy since I always wear a shirt.. hid it for about 2 months. second one on my foot, I just always wore socks or slippers.. hid that one for 4 months. when i did show them, they were shocked that i hid it, but they know I'm an adult, it's my body and I make my own decisions.|`|dz97Jmnkaa	my brother did. but he got it done on his back, and in the summer he accidentaly took his shirt off and my mum went mad lol.  but it depends where u have it done.   if it's somewhere where you can see it badly then no but if it's like on your foot then i guess so.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	My girlfriend has three tattoos and her mom doesnt know about any of them!!
OXOHoISraa	Depends on where you are. I know a place that will charge you $150 an hour and can remove a sleeve in about 4 -  2 hour sessions.shop around, and look into wrecking balm. my husband used it with good results but he was just trying to lighten a tattoo|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	It depends on the colour, some are easier to break down than others and take less sessions. If you have a greeny colour you'll be lucky to get rid of it at all. But either way you'll be well into the hundreds. I would recommend visiting a good tattoo artist with a good portfolio of cover up work (check in advance) and talk to him about designing you something to cover it over. Much cheaper and much more fun!|`|YXXvhDLWaa	A good $500 at least. It's cheaper and less painful to get it covered up with another tattoo|`|RCkeHaukaa	A lot of money...over $400 and up....Plus:    A whole lot more pain !    Just cover it up with another since it is tiny :)|`|h8OqX12Haa	my friend just got her tattoo removed it was a small kanji for faith on her neck she said that it hurt  like a b__tch even with the local injections to numb the area   she paid 450$ the tattoo was in black and it was about 3 inches long   but its better and less painful to cover it up with another tattoo
9BtA5Knfaa	No the ink was put deep into your skin, the only way is the professional way!      Or you can CARVE that part of your skin off with a knife!!!|`|FRKCrLNSaa	Yes, but thats really painful.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	LMAO mandie - she probably headed off to buy the bleach before even getting to the end of your sentence - well good luck to her! ;-)|`|8qeDEWWJaa	No.You will eff the tattoo up more.|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	Owwww. That would hurt so much. You would probably get third-degree burns which is probably the worst pain you can be put through. Don't do it. Get it off professionally|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	Heck no people these days are using bleach. Just go to the store buy the *clorox bleach pen* then kind of like draw over the tattoo. Leave it for like an hour then wala your tattoo is gone all for only $2         Legit::    You are an idiot!!    Sure go ahead, and burn your tattoo off let me know how that works out for you.        *Ha (inked Mama)    Probably lol....I hate to sound mean I really do it's just...jeez these people have NO common sense lol    The sad thing is people really have been using bleach thinking it would work     ? :-/ lol I mean..ugh|`|AA11027952	you can... but please get it on video and post on youtube so we all can get a good laugh|`|C6UpJfhiaa	yeah it doesnt even really hurt that bad    it doesnt scar either ive done it like four times|`|nzPZYgY6aa	thattttt woulllldddddd huuuuurrrrttttt sooooooooooooooooo baadddddlylyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy ! buttt yeah it will work .|`|P9inKWOaaa	hahahh whoops|`|CIqI2CXaaa	no...you'll damage the skin, but it won't affect the tattoo in anyway|`|YXXvhDLWaa	Only the truly stupid can do that....so you might be ok|`|H3PcFertaa	Good lord!!!  Yikes, please stop yourself! You will just succeed in making what you don't like uglier and you risk infection too.  I doubt that a burn scarred tattoo is going to look better than an unwanted small tattoo.  The best solution and the most successful (especially with a small tattoo) is a tattoo cover up (not make up). Find a good licensed, reputable tattoo artist, and find an image that you actually like and will continue to love your whole life, and have that worked into a cover up tattoo for you. It will be custom and unique and all yours.  What you propose doing, is making a bad situation worse!   If you are underage, then wait until you are old enough, and then do it right this time around. Don't compound your problem because of rash decisions made in ignorance and haste!  Do it right.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Why not just cut your arm off, you won't have to worry about the tattoo any longer?|`|7Yzk6EbGaa	yes, i suggest using a blowtorch|`|uUHMg5Szaa	no, not on your own, you can't just burn it like a normal burn, that will mess up the tattoo, go to a parlor and get it done, I know it can be expensive but it is worth it.      (=|`|AQcx69GVaa	well if yu can stand the pain?!  + i know a friend that did that it got pretty icky.   if its really tiny.. either  - go for it  - or get another tattoo redrawn on it (if the issue is the image)  - laser removal|`|EgGrKWjxaa	If you can, just get a cover up tattoo.|`|rvmj8vVCaa	no you can't, you can cause major skin damage, horrible scars, damage the tissue,nerves.. And so much more. and deathly dangerous infections.    doesn't matter if it the size of a ant, or the size of a elephant, you can still get bad diseases. especially MRSA.     It's really a pointless thing to do.  Burn a hole in your skin,  or get it removed professionally?     i say number 2.  But that's my opinion, you  do what you want, it's your body.    just think about the risks before you do anything.|`|RdlR9Hwwaa	if you do you will have a scar and the tattoo will still be there, when you get a tattoo it marks about 2-3 layers under the top layer of skin, don't be an idiot get it removed by laser or by a professional...!!|`|0T3qOcUFaa	Only way to find out is to try it...but try hitting it first.|`|XMgUrglfaa	Frankly, I'd use a knife and cauterize the wound.  That's what I did to remove the swastikas on my skin when I went to prison.  Earned a lot of respect by doing that.|`|D9axbzwzaa	Keep it........studies have shown that tattoos can increase the chances of testicular cancer.
IbI487CYaa	Try getting the cermaic braces which are tooth-colored. They are still noticeable but not as notable as metal braces and only cost $500 to $700 more than regular braces. They look like this: http://www.embrace.com.sg/images/service...  http://drhungvu.com/yahoo_site_admin/ass...  http://users.southjersey.com/images/419/...    Or you can get the metal ones and have them change the color of the bands every month. It won't make you look geeky but it is a little unattractive. However, you will have gorgeous teeth once it comes off.   Also, you may be one of those lucky people who actually look good in braces.|`|ukBX5OOsaa	Well I'm not a guy, but I've had the colored ones and then my last set of braces were the clear regular ones, the clear regular ones are much harder to notice.|`|7qTKREOmaa	well im not a guy but you probably wont look geeky. a lot of guys have braces too and they still look hot.|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	No! Brace's are not geeky, don't worry.  A lot of people say that I look even better  then I did, trust me you'll be fine. & If you're  still worried about it, then think about how  amazing you're going to look afterwards with  you're straight teeth. (:|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	Go with the colored braces. They help describe your individuality, and if your are confident, you can pull anything off. Make sure, after you get them, don't do the "smile-without-showing-your-teeth" thing, it is stupid, and I hate when people do it. Be proud of them!!|`|78PpGB1Kaa	i had braces for over a year (still have them) and i think i look better with it :) some people imo have the "braces face" which means they look really good with braces    if you don't believe me look at this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qA9eM6ObS... the blonde has braces and is very pretty|`|psuuyX8kaa	My girlfirend had pink braces and I thought they were sexy.    And I dont know if its just me but I don't care what colour braces anyone has.|`|DrFJfnpBaa	I know you said guys only but I faced same problem.  I will say NEVER ever get a neon color brace like neon blue or green. Light pink looks great on girls. And if you don't like pink get a purple. But if you don't want them so noticeable get silver.
XdCgTwpFaa	Yes you can, but eewww! Try a nice non-sparkling brown shadow that matches your natural brow color.  As a blonde, I have very faint eyebrows & a good, soft brown shadow works wonders & thickens & defines more  naturally. After I follow my brow with the shadow, I brush upwards with a brow or mustache brush to rid of any excess powder. It's quick, & easy, & more natural looking.|`|RvJElelaaa	i think it would look weird with a liquid eyeliner, use a pencil eyeliner?|`|MMYgBIReaa	no! that would look really extremely fake!|`|mrdfwEAjaa	You can, but i wouldn't.

53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	do try to see that they dry out as much as possible before you go for your tat as they can be a problem,i only hope they are tiny as you say,you may be lucky and they might not be in the way,or be easy to work round.do mention them to your tattoo artist when you go for your appointment though.  i was once doing a tat of a fairy on a guys shoulder and just in time discovered a pimple on the end of the fairy's nose!! close one ,but it worked out fine. :o)  good luck|`|4RCf3wyxaa	Enhance the pimple!!!!!!!|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	they might, but most probably wont. if you tattoo over a pimple you will break the skin and release any bacteria inside it, which could lead to infection and possibly scarring. i would either hold off until your skin clears up or get it in a different area.|`|OXOHoISraa	depends. it they are like heat ash or tiny tiny, probably. if you have a big nasty red pimple, probably not.

wyCJ365oaa	I'm a woman, but honestly, there are so many beautiful girls with all different kinds of hair colors. It depends on the face, not the hair color. A girl can be very unattractive and be blonde, brunette, or red haired. The same goes the opposite way.    Look, you've got a beautiful blonde, such as Cameron Diaz  http://www.celebrityvalues.com/images/ca...  And, then you've got the horrendous ones. Take for instance...this horrible excuse for a woman:  http://styletraxx.com/paris-hilton-pic.g...    Then you've got the gorgeous brunettes, Adriana Lima and Angelina Jolie  http://z.about.com/d/racerelations/1/7/T...  http://www.alleba.com/blog/wp-content/ph...    Then, you've got Amy Winehouse.  http://rosasacidas.files.wordpress.com/2...    And with redheads, you've got Nicole Kidman with her gorgeous red hair:  http://images.allposters.com/images/73/0...    And.. of course, a horrible Linsay Lohan. Ew.  http://imagecache2.allposters.com/images...    See?  Hope I've helped!    EDIT: I just ADORE how people give me a thumbs DOWN for telling the truth. Blondes aren't 'hot' because they're blonde and same goes with every other hair color. Thumbs down? Hilarious.|`|qoKvIsBYaa	I am partial to dark strawberry blonde! Being one and all!

qCQJ7t3Oaa	Stop tanning, stay out of sunlight, use sunscreen to avoid sun damage that will cause you to have wrinkles, possibility for melanoma/ skin cancer, and try using a lighter concealer. My advice would be to go to a department store, like Macy's, Nordstoms, or anywhere where they have make-up artists working, and go up to one and tell them exactly what you asked here. They will tell you the solution. If you go to MAC, they more then likely will solve you skin issues, with some foundation, concealer, and perhaps recommend you a moisturizer to put on your face each morning to prevent further discoloration or sun damage. I suggest you ask them to apply in on you so you can see if it gives you the results you are looking for vs. buying it and being disappointed, If MAC is a little too pricey for you, then still go to a dept. store  have them apply makeup to your face and then say thanks, maybe you will come back later and go to CVS or Wal Mart and pick out the same colors and products they used on you at the department store.     Hope I helped a little  good luck|`|7ZtB526Haa	Oh my dear--too much sun--ask MAKE-UP  girls--lemon lightens too--must be  some make ups--darker make-up is all i can think!!Be careful-is it a pigmentation disorder maybe??See Dr (skin specialist) Good luck !!!|`|y05dLJfYaa	Try staying out of the sun (tanning wise) until the tan goes away. For something quick (like going out) you could try applying some white body powder. (Dita Von Teese does it to make her seem lighter.)|`|NYBo35zjaa	Lemon juice used as an astringent, works good naturally.  I don't suggest you try at home techniques due to the pinking in the cheek area, go to a dermatologist, not a cosmetic surgeon, a skin care specialist and preferably one that has clients of all races, they seem to be more knowledgeable in my personal experience|`|GOKycFafaa	You can use bleaching cream. Hope this helps.

VOILA!|`|087Hso5iaa	Getting called cute is better than hot. Guys only call girls hot because they think they're some sex object or something.

Like, in L.A., most of the people have belly button rings if they have the body, and it's hot. But say, in the Upper east Side of Manhattan, every girl there has to be very classy and proper, and a belly button piercing would look trashy.|`|RuM2I3gGaa	If you have a great stomach, go for it. Be careful because it can easily get infected. You can hide it easy and it can look exotic.|`|zih1Weanaa	Honestly, I think it is a matter of personal preference. All of my friends got one when I was in high school, and I was in the middle of convincing my parents to let me get one when I decided against it. My friends were not trashy, but they felt like they needed to show it off every chance they got (especially in school). I didnt want to be one of those girls.    I also did not want to deal with months of cleaning it out and having jeans rub against it and irritating me. Also, I think belly buttons are cute and are a part of the appeal of the sexiness of the stomach, and a big ring in the middle that could possibly get infected isnt that hot.|`|Ti4HrMD8aa	its only sexy if ur under 25 and u have a nice flat stomach|`|L4Bnecwoaa	i dont think the piercing itself it's trashy, girls with it done only look trashy when they dress trashy! the piercing is just an association.  i've had mine done for over 6 years now but i've never shown it off as i dont have a flat tummy so i guess mine is a bit pointless but if you want it done then do it. 1 piercing doesnt make you trashy or look trashy.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	I think it is just too common. so trashy.

sHUnctqIaa	Honey is a natural humectant, meaning it draws moisture in. A honey facial will help to hydrate your skin without making it oily, it will also help to calm and soothe redness, flaking or chapping. A mask of honey and aloe will help you to retain moisture but it will nt make you less oily. If your having oil problems try a mask out or terrasil or china clay. Also look for products with cucumber and rose, both of which help to heal skin, reduce redness and reduce oiliness. You could grind up some cucumber in a blender and mix that into a honey mask if you have oily skin.   The vitamin zinc help to regulate your body's oil production and well as boost your immune system, take one a day with a vitamin C capsule to help your skin balance from the inside out.|`|khAdkx5eaa	IT DO NOT    IT WILL RUIN YOUR FACE    IT WILL LEAVE RESIDUE UND ITCH UND ITCH    IT WILL FESTER UND FERMENT    UND YULL BE STUNG    STUNG BY THE BEES UND THE WASPS WILL HOLD COURT    HONEY COMB IS OUT ....HAIR PIC IS IN    CAUSE MIT HONEY ON YOUR FACE...YULL GET MITES!!!!!!
lchlMMMIaa	Hey,     The bump on your nose may be something called a keltoid.. or granulating tissue. It is compeletly normal, but annoying. The best thing you can do is wait if this is the case, but if there is any discharge or smell etc, see your local GP as it could be an infection.     How old is your piercing, becasue if it fresh i wouldnt be using tea tree oil on it as this keeps the wound open and does not allow it to heal.    Also I have had my nose pierced twice, the first time with a corkscrew, and I couldnt get it back through, try buying a straight bar stud, although i has this the second time round and got a lot of nose bleeds (i dont have my nose pierced any more) :-(     Hope this helps,    Rachelle-maree|`|WHmTmAb1aa	Dont worry, ice it down for an hour or so, it will go away.

NYBo35zjaa	The Bio oil advice and Palmer's is awesome, I used a combination of the Palmer's coconut, vitamin E oil the thicker the better  and Shea butter, the Vitamin E oil you can purchase at Rite Aid small bottler that looks like a finger nail polish, mix it with Palmer's, the Shea butter you can find in a cream or hard like lard, you'll have to soften it though mix all three or use individually worked wonders and skin was silky smooth even children liked rubbing me like their favorite blanket.|`|AA12249040	Bio oil was meant to help.

4XcmCKPbaa	Well the two major things are eye liner and air.  Apply eye liner to the lower and upper part of your eyes heavily.  When it comes to the hair, you need a comb and hairspray. Take a piece of your hair and hold it up.  Spray some hair spray on it  and then brush the comb back and forth by your roots. repeat this all over your hair until it is poofy.  extentions (like coon tails) are also very scene. hope this helped!|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	. . . . . . . .|`|QnSKaBcjaa	put pink in the crease and on inner eye, blend up . put black in the outer corner blend line your whole eye w black liner. dont mess w red, itll make you look sick|`|1ioI2py4aa	red lipstick(dark red), lots of black eyeliner, draw a cross on the edge of your eye about 1cm long, lots of bright pink eyeshadow going up to your brow|`|4aGoWKtEaa	-Black eyeliner  -Black mascara  -Purple eyeshadow|`|0VUFAa6raa	http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2118/2482...    http://s252.photobucket.com/albums/hh31/...    http://s252.photobucket.com/albums/hh31/...

tCCuF55uaa	Well you can match your eyeshadow to your clothes but there are exceptions. You can wear one of the colors to match your clothes. Like if your wearing a blue shirt that has pink writing you can wear pink eyeshadow.    It does look tacky if you match your eyeshadow to everything you're wearing but if you add other colors it looks pretty good. Like if your wearing a purple shirt trying doing purple and gold to turn it up a bit.|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	i used to do the same thing, but it tends to look tacky.  wear something that works with your skin color, not your outfit.|`|GBMd55FJaa	not having the same coloures as your clothes is not true AT ALL but if you can try contrasting coloures where if your wearing a orange top where yellow eyeshadow. or if your wearing green, where brown or light green. -x-|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	Because what if you were wearing hot pink?

If I'm honest, it's probably going to be easier to just buy two sets of tapers. It's more expensive, but if you want to commit to the process of stretching your ears then it's the best way to do it.     When you're stretching to the next size, try taking a hot shower or a bath first because then your skin is more pliable. Put your taper in some antibacterial solution and apply some lubricant to your ear and to the taper to help it go in better and reduce the discomfort.     Good luck!|`|FZCi6WXRaa	Maybe you just shouldn't stretch your ears you make no sense!

q5wKgjacaa	depends on your skin. and now that you have that tatoo know this:  Tattoos and allergies  A tattoo is a permanent marking made by inserting ink into the layers of skin to change the pigment for decorative or other reasons. Because it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing may carry health risks, including infection and allergic reactions.  The metals in the ink might have effects  on your body. According to dermatologist Dr. Lisa Zanetti Rhodes, reactions can occur because of the metal salts used to make the colored inks. "Mercury (red), chromium (green), cobalt (blue) and cadmium (yellow) are the top sensitizers," she said. "The reaction can range from localized redness to a generalized eczema-like rash. Often, systemic steroids are needed for treatment. Some inks were found to have high levels of lead, some contained lithium, and the blue inks were full of copper. Allergic reactions may occur infrequently with permanent tattoos, but the long-term health effects are still unknown due to the lack of regulation, testing, and long-term studies.  This usually happens 3 to 5 years after the tattoo, although cases have been reported as early as a few months and as late as 20 years. Remedies usually involve OTC lotion or in more severe cases, medication prescribed by a dermatoligist. Occasionally, an ingredient in yellow ink will cause the skin to become very sensitive to sunlight.    The allergic reactions could also lead to irreversible conditions, such as allergies to rubber or elastic, clothes and hair dyes. Teenagers and children are especially vulnerable to these conditions.  In contrast to the low incidence of reported allergic reactions to permanent tattoos, however, certain temporary Henna tattoos have been very problematic. Henna tattoos that contain the dark brown dye para-phenylenediamine (PPD) can cause a delayed allergic reaction and subsequent PPD hyper-sensitization that may permanently prohibit one from using sulfa drugs, PABA sunscreens, benzocaine and other anesthetics, and hair dyes. Fragrance sensitization may occur, and in some cases, the reaction will include skin necrosis, scarring, and hypo-pigmentation. Analysis of henna dye used on persons who reported allergic reactions has shown the presence of toxic chemicals from hair and textile dyes, in addition to PPD.    The question of toxicity is multifaceted; there are others factors that may exponentially increase the serious health risks associated with tattooing. When alcohol is used as part of the carrier base in tattoo ink or to disinfect the skin before application of the tattoo, it increases the skins permeability, helping to transport more chemicals into the bloodstream. Alcohol also works synergistically with mutagens, teratogens, and carcinogens to make them even more harmful, increasing the chance that they may cause mutation or disease, both at the site of the tattoo and systemically.  Other health risks.  In addition to allergic reactions and the unknown long-term health effects from the metal salts and carrier solutions that make up tattoo inks, there are other health risks involved. Skin infections, psoriasis, dermatitis and other chronic skin conditions, and tumors (both benign, and malignant) have all been associated with tattoos. Due to the use of needles in tattoo application, there is also the risk of contracting infectious diseases such as tetanus, herpes simplex virus, staph, HIV, AIDS, Hepatitis B and C, and even Syphilis. And those with tattoos might not be able to get a life-saving MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) test if they need onesome hospitals and testing locations will refuse to do an MRI on people with body tattoos due to the metal particles in the tattoo, which may cause a burning pain during the test.    If you plan on having your tattoo removed, you should be aware that some of the pigments used (especially Yellow  7) are phototoxic and may break down into toxic chemicals in the body when removed with UV light or laser, common techniques used in tattoo removal. The toxic end-products eventually wind up in the kidneys and liver, adding to your total body burden.  Think for yourself.  In an ideal world, the trade secrets clause that allows companies to put profit over public health would be disallowed for all products used topically, transdermally, or ingested into our bodies. However, in the absence of federal regulation to protect the consumer from unqualified tattoo artists, unhygienic tools and application methods, and highly toxic inks, the best advice for the youth of today is abstinence from tattoos. At the very least, one should find out if their state has any regulations on tattoo inks, and always ask to see the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) for any pigment or carrier used to see basic health and safety information for the ingredients involved. Skin tests should be performed prior to tattoo application to see if you are allergic to any of the ingredients.

This happens to EVERYONE. Even Victoria's Secret models. You'll grow out of it.

WGFtXo6Paa	I'm the same age as you, and I agree with you on the color combinations part. Once I got pink and orange, and it looked horrible! Try to go for darker colors if you want your teeth to look whiter. I think navy is the best. I also like teal, but that doesn't make your teeth look as white as with nayv. Right now, I have gray and they're ok. Not the worst, but I don't like it. Dark green is a good color to go wit hyour uniform. I wouldn't suggest pink because that makes your teeth look yellow. So the best is navy. You might be thinking it's too dark, but it's really not once it goes on your teeth. Oh, and if anyone tells you don't get green or something because it looks like spinach stuck inyour teeth, that's completely not true! Obviously, people would see you have braces so tehy wouldn't think there's spinach stuck inyour teeth, haha. Oh and also, along with navy, I think purple would look good! I'll try that color next time I go to the orthodontist.|`|SwUXGNDiaa	Umm you can easily fix the yellow tint  Go buy pre-brush whitening mouthwash.    As for colors i agree about the combination thing RETARDED.  I think you should get black or teal.|`|5xmr3EJtaa	go with ur favorite color it will look awesome no matter whet u choose|`|VwnsSC4waa	go for subtle colors like navy or black. they dont make your teeth look yellow and they go with anything|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	well i have green braces right now  and my teeth are a little bit yellow  (cant wait till i get them off so i can  whiten my teeth!!)  and they look fine  really, any color looks pretty good  they will look really weird at first   and you probably will not like them at all  when you first get them on  so it doesnt matter to much what color|`|GBEgFS19aa	try clear or silver :)  i have silver on rite now|`|nntQUfl1aa	i'd go with navy .it's the most subtle and it matches everything.|`|sr8EWgdpaa	I think bright blue, green, pink, red or purple (:|`|ezPTRG8jaa	purple and lime green
TyFoi2ONaa	wear a gold cream eyeshadow with black cat eye eyeliner, obv. mascara and some pink highlighter on your cheeks for a natural glow. Have lots of fun |`|qH7IA1Staa	eye liner or mascara. not bothe since ur blond and prbly a bit pale, u don't wanna look like a goth ;0|`|Phjj2Gr3aa	I really like what Tina said.  You can also search YouTube for videos on applying makeup.|`|bJF3tGtfaa	I agree with the natural look, you don't want to take attention away from your dress. If I were you, I'd do a light brown shade and a light colored gloss. Pink blush and a touch of mascara. Have fun tonight & I hope I helped! :)|`|genZbG74aa	I think a bronzed brown look would be good with eyeliner on the top lashline and dramatic mascara.add some blush and there you go! and, make sure not to use a sticky lipgloss because when you're dancing your hair will obviously get into you face a lot.|`|fsyz8Qwoaa	try a champagne shadow on the inner half of your eyes, including your inner crease and the bottom of your eye. then put a darker color like black or gray on the outer half of your eyelid. only put eyeliner where the darker shadow is and use a defining mascara.|`|3qvZTOUJaa	try champagne/gold eyeshadow and add sparkles. add a lot of mascara to longen your eyelashes. put a lot of deep black eyeliner.|`|FPpUeJ6taa	soft and natural:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RAIgRKNm...
0L0teu7jaa	Since the eye liner is a dark brown you should be fine still wearing the black mascara. Personally, I'm not a huge fan of brown mascara...I don't think it does much. Another thing to think about is the Bare Escentuals eye liners and eye shadows are basically the same thing. So if you don't like it as an eye liner you could use it lightly as an eye shadow.
tur2Ajk0aa	shopper's drug mart|`|jgQ4mSNraa	Actually u can try shoppers drug mart or walmart u can find it at any makeup store
aV0QmAOtaa	Try using a lemon mask, lemons lightening your skin after several and routine usage. You can try to put lemons straight to your face or maybe some mild lemon juice. If you want to do your entire body, the best thing I recommend is that you take a bath and fill it up with slices of lemon. Here's a better example of what I'm trying to say:    http://www.flickr.com/photos/kahluacream...    If this process is all too much for you, I recommend going for the creams. But this is by far one of the most natural ways you can do it without having to risk buying and spending so much money on skin creams and have them not work, etc.    best of luck! :)|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	Your skin is the way it is, you can't change it like you can change the colour of your hair. You just have to learn to accept who you are, and work with what you have :]|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	you cant make yorself pale.. its your skin type and you cant change that!!|`|C4LT48CFaa	Just stay out of the sun, always wear sunscreen every day, sit in the shade, and wear a hat with a wide brim or carry a black umbrella whenever you are planning to be outside.  But the first thing to work on is to see yourself as beautiful instead of ugly because true beauty comes from the inside out.|`|jRmBgDE2aa	-stay away from the sun  -wear sunblock (not sunscreen) spf 40 or higher  -lemon juice in baking soda, then add it to your skin. leave it on for 10 minutes then wash with warm water.  -papaya soap  -body scrubs    good luck!|`|j287TrG1aa	sit in a closet. Forever|`|ZlKjl0aRaa	STAY AWAY FROM SUNLIGHT|`|uzWqpG0Maa	In my town all the girls are going to the tanning salons. You want to be pale. Weird. I guess you could go hang around in the closet. Same thing. Can't you just be happy with the way you are ? In the end, you will find wisdom and understand it is what God put inside you that counts.   Outrider

HLmd17r9aa	Exfoliate your skin before going outside or into a tanning bed. Make sure your skin is moisturized too. Exfoliating will help to scrub off dead skin so you won't be tanning skin that is about to come off anyways, whereas the moisturizer will help attract the light/sun to your skin and penetrate deeper into the skin.|`|354a5c904225797c94e05876cf0c8196aa	shake and bake?  Jergins is pretty good if you have the patience
kiJUCYMcaa	right first thing dont go over the top with the make up, wear a bit of mascara, some blusher and stuff your hair, maybe straighten your hair and and the clothes seem okay but maybe a necklace, just dont go over the top, hope this helps:)|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Your outfit sounds perfect.    For make up: Wear foundation (if you want to wear it some girls do some girls dont) For your eyes wear pink or silver eye shadow OR wear collection 2000 glitter top liner. Its soooo nice and looks good on. Costs only a few pounds too. They sell it in lots of colours but I think silver would be best to match your bolero.    Wear black mascara and if you like wearing it black eyeliner.    Hair: I think you should straighten your hair so that its different from your normal wavy style. Use straighteners so that it looks sleek.    Have fun!      X|`|PAyK3hniaa	I think you should have your hair loose with big waves in it.  For make-up; use a blue eyeliner, which will make your eyes stand out. And a good mascara.  Eye shadow is so dated, so just use the eyeliner around the eye.    Maybe you should wear something to make you look more grown-up? I'm sure the pink halterneck looks fine but to have all the guys after you why not try something like this...  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  And you can wear it with thick, wet look leggings if you're worried about it being too short..  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  Then team it with some blue heels to bring the outfit together..  http://www.topshop.com/webapp/wcs/stores...    You'll look gorgeous! xx|`|G7fqgUo3aa	I think the outfit sounds great, I love the silver bolero. I think you should find/buy a silver/rhinestone type headband (maybe one that has double bands-see website link below in Source box). You should wear your hair either all up, more loose and wavy, or at least 1/2 of your hair up. Either way, leave some loose strands in the bang area around your face. For makeup, definitely do a pale pink lipstick or gloss. For your eyes, I would do a deeper blue eye liner, then use a darker blue eye shadow to make it smokey, but use a lighter shimmery shadow for blending and highlighting under the eyebrows. Use black mascara, black makes your blue eyes more blue(see 2nd link in Source box below for pic)! If you want some extra bling/shimmer for the Disco theme, sprinkle a little bit of body glimmer on your hair and arms (if you will take bolero off)Good luck, hope you like the suggestions!

W91X0Lfvaa	Purples, greens and blues. At least those are the colors that really make my brown eyes pop when I wear them. :)    You don't even have to do bright colors if you don't like them, they have really subtle shades of those colors that you can use that can still look more natural and make your eyes stand out too. :D|`|aV0QmAOtaa	purples, greens, blues and maybe reds.  we brown eye'd ladies have an advantage :)|`|aOsMqwbfaa	Yellow & Purple are two good ones that I personally like.|`|7NiFxZ3faa	If you look really deep into your eyes you may be able to find an undertone. An undertone is a little bit of color hardly even noticeable around your pupil. If your eyes are brown then your undertone may be green or gold. Eyeshadow the same color as your undertone looks absolutely fabulous. Remember though, you may not have undertones. Hope this helped! :)|`|4fy9M8o6aa	I have brown eyes and my favorite look to do on my eyes to make them pop is white eyeshadow with navy blue eyeliner  the white makes the eye look awake  and the navy blue eyeliner makes the eyes look bright without using to bright of a color....    1.apply white eyeshadow on your lid  2.appy, navy blue eyeliner on your water line  3.apply navy blue eyeliner on your upper lashline and smudge it and wing the eyeliner out a little  4.use a bright blue eyeshadow on top of the eyeliner so it will make the blue pop a little  5.apply white to your inner corners(it makes your eyes pop a TON)  6.mascara in your choice of color  7.if you want to i sometimes apply white or blue glitter to my upper lasline over the eyeliner to top off the whole look!    hope i helped(:|`|uV9Jvbr8aa	I have brown eyes, and I use light brown/golden eye shadows.

oWpckmWvaa	everyone is different. some people say that the most painful part is the clamp, others say they didnt feel anything, and some people say its the most painful thing ever  i have a really low pain tolerance and needless to say i was scared s***less when i went to get mine.  i didnt feel any pain with the clamp all it feel like was a squeeze but it didnt hurt at all. but when they stuck the needle through my skin - it hurt. it feels the way it sounds, a needle is being stuck through your skin.  that was a bit painful and so was when they stuck the peircing into me but after they were all done i felt fine and it only hurts for a week when you do certain movements like bending over and stuff.  they are tottally worth it for the 15 seconds of pain though!  just make sure you take GOOD care of it..  good luck!!    oh and p.s. it shouldn't get infected if you put on a sea-salt solution about 3-4 times a day for the first couple of weeks|`|Ic7cM3Kwaa	i got mine done a month ago and it didnt hurt, the only painful part was the clamps they use, trust me. i didn't even know they were done once they pierced it. i just kept sitting there. and mines not infected, you just have to wash it like they say!|`|OJtZDriuaa	well i'm not sure because i haven't pierced my navel but i have friends that have and they've all said it wasnt painful.|`|m2Q2099Vaa	i didn't feel either of mine, i have 2 of them.  it takes about 1 minute.  it's easy to take care of them, and they if you do, they probably won't get infected.|`|2p4EtFyVaa	every one ses it isnt painfull , but who really knows because no one really remebers pain but for me at the moment it was pain ful the ring going in after the needle , buh the clamps are painfull nd i would say it does hurt more than the piercing , buh it also depends on hte person hope i helped

sHUnctqIaa	Use a Mineral Powder foundation and blend it all over your face using a Kabuki brush, then go back over with a concealer brush and using the same foundation touch up under the eyes, around the mouth and over any blemishes or imperfections. Once your skin tone is even, use a light rose blush and sweep it from the apples of your cheeks out to your hair line, blend around the edges so it look natural, not bold.     For the eyes, use a light Gold or Bone colored shadow and blend from you crease, to the brow bone, down to the corner of the eye, sweeping the entire eyelid with color, then using a dark coppery brown blend up from the lash line to the crease and out in an ark towards the edge of the eye. Line with a dark brown pencil on top and lightly on the bottom. Follow with blackest black mascara and a natural pink gloss.     For a nice dewey glow sweep you whole face with an all over color like Warm Radience by Bare Minerals.|`|4fy9M8o6aa	just use some light founation like powder to make it look natural and i rosy blush lightly swept on the cheeks and for her eyes she used brown eyeliner on top and bottom    how to do her eyeliner:  apply some brown eyeliner on your water line all the way to the inner corner for her top eyeliner just glide the pencil eyeliner in brown across your upper lashline and smuge a little and win it out slightly....    for her eyeshadow it looks liek she just used a brown eyeshadow and just swept it on her lid then for your lips apply a chapstick of soem sort!|`|3qvZTOUJaa	you need a lot of makeup to make it look that natural. its too hard to copy|`|857diC7Faa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you.

sHUnctqIaa	It definitely plumps your lips but it stings like crazy, too much for me. Same with Urban decay big fatty lip plumper, does a great job but hurts too much for me to want to put it on regularly. I like Buxom by Bare Escentuals, It's just the right amount of plump for me but it has peppermint oil in it, so it doesn't sting, it tingles. It's $18 here so I'm not sure how many Euros that is. One thing I can tell you is to buy your plumper at Sephora and save the receipt as they allow you to return opened products if you don't like them. Good luck!|`|HgRYP3cJaa	My daughter loves it - but it does sting a little.|`|Xb4FXr0Saa	i wouldn't get it if i were you. it is very painful! your lips swell and get all red thats is how lip plumpers work.. by irritating your lips! it sings like a mother!|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Waste of money.|`|d88b93b48da04baca46ed69b0ed87e6daa	OK. I own this myself. I have one with gold shimmer, and you cant even see the gold because your lips turn so red. So it wont go with all make up. Only colours that go with red.   Yes, it deffinitly stings. sometimes it even makes my tongue feel funny ( that can't be a good thing surely) My sister tried it and had to go to work looking like homer simpson (you know the shadow he gets from shaving, hehe). and she had a lump on the back of her hand from where she put a bit too.  Personally, I like the feeling. And it does make your lips bigger. You have to use it regularly for it to last. You will notice a change in about 5-10 mins.    There is a less harsh one that has an effect, but in a gentler way. It's called Soap and Glory. They make a range of plumpers called 'sexy mother pucker' and theyre cheaper than Too Faced too.

Also, do really good in science. Take AP or Honors classes.    Be sure to talk to your counselor when you get to high school (assuming you're not yet) about your career choice and what classes he/she recommends.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	well i  want to be a pediatrician or an orthodontist too.

You have to take English and Math if you want to do those kinds of business things...and you have to get good marks, hopefully landing you a scholarship.

0HtTJAQoaa	A number of skin irritations may accompany indoor tanning at one time or another. Among these are rashes, itches, dry skin or white spots.     An itch may occur from a reduced rate of melanin production in a particular area of the body, usually the stomach, chest, or other areas that have had minimal exposure to sunlight or tanning for a prolonged period. This may occur between the 3rd and 5th tanning session for most people, is normally temporary, and more of a nuisance than a real problem. This is usually a result of overstimulation of the nerve endings.     It is best to tan no more than every other day and build up tanning exposure time gradually, to give the skins' melanin, in normally unexposed areas, time to catch up with those areas always exposed outside, like the face and hands. Use a good aloe product, like our Pure Aloe Plus, for relief from itching.     Overdry skin caused by the light and heat from the tanning system may also cause itching. It is important to use a good moisturizing product regularly, after tanning, to prevent the skin from drying and replenish moisture loss from the tanning process. Certain chemicals or ingredients found in cosmetics, lotions, shampoos, and cleaners used on tanning beds, may also potential causes of itching.     See link below for more info...|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	you are damaging your skin...the lights are BURNING your skin off, thats why it itches.

I live in FL..I see it all the time.|`|OsHjXzxUaa	same thing happened to my frined. dont use that stuff anymore, its prob not ment for beds (the rays from the sun are different then the beds). buy one of the lotions they sell at the place u go tanning. but stop using that stuff. the itching means the lotion is reacting to the bed and its going to cause ur skin to start peeling. and u dont want that! lol wel, hope this helped :)|`|QWFvw2yvaa	cuz the sun is evil thats why. you shouldn't tan anyway its bad for you!|`|Jevw5cbqaa	Because the radiation from the lights is destroying your skin.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	I think the same thing happens to everyone !

Also, I would recommend use of a tanning booth instead of the beds!!! And make sure that the floor of the booth is sprayed down & wiped. The beds seem to be a possible haven for all sorts of germs & microorganisms! You never know what viruses, & bacteria can be transmitted thru those nasty beds...Just be very careful! I actually contracted a virus from what I believed to have gotten from the tanning bed...It was called Molloscum Contagiosum, and it reallllyyy was itchy & horrible. My dermatologist ended up treating it by freezing the bumps with liquid nitrogen...I'm just saying being careful...See here on Molluscum:  http://www.healthlinkalberta.ca/Topic.as...  My sister's ex got Scabies, and believed it he got it from a tanning bed...You could also possibly contract:  Athlete's Foot or Ringworm...Be sure that the place you go to sanitizes it well enuf!

wHn2VITgaa	I have some home remedies and advices for you. I hope this helps:    When the skin lubricated, become clogged or are not regenerated in sufficient quantity to handle the load this may result in whiteheads or blackheads being formed. Pimples are then formed when the bacteria is released from these clogged pores.    For serious blemishes, try washing with Fels-Naptha soap, strong stuff for oily skin. However, if your skin is normal or dry, youll need something gentler for your face.    Clearing Up The Outside From The Inside Grandma, like mothers everywhere, swears that all the high-fat food we love so much does a number on our complexions. Scientists may not be quite as convinced, but to be on the safe side, avoid chocolate, chips and fried foods.      Eating more brown rice is good advice for improving overall health. It is also good for your complexin. To ward off pimples and other facial blemishes, make brown rice a regular part of your diet.    Keeping the skin and body hydrated by drinking at least eight glasses of water daily is an effective method of keeping the skin clear and assisting it in clearing wastes.    Studies show that zinc deficiency may contribute to acne. Be sure to check with your doctor before taking a supplement, since too much zinc may have harmful side-effects.    Spread It On Thick To help fight pimples, use a paste of onion and honey. Cook one sliced onion in a half cup honey until it is tender. Mash with a fork to form into a paste and allow the mixture to cool. Apply to the problem rea, leaving it on for an hour before rinsing away with warm water. Use this treatment every night before going to bed until your complexion is clear and sparkling. An application of egg whites helps distribute the skins natural oils more evenly, eliminating both dry and oily patches.    Swab the egg white on your face with a cotton ball, allow to stand for five minutes and remove. Studies have shown that certain amino acids in the egg whites protein may have some anti-inflammatory properties. In most cases, small blemishes and pimples can be eliminated or reduced in size in a matter of days.    Oatmeal has long been used to control the spread of acn, as well as to speed up the healing process. Prepare the oatmeal as directed (without the milk, brown sugar, and raisins, of course!) and apply to the face. Let it stand for ten to fifteen minutes before washing off. The abrasive action of the oats cleanses deeply and increases the peripheral circulation in the affected rea, which speeds up healing.    Acne and eczema as well as psoriasis have responded well to a paste made from the grain amaranth and placed on the affected area. Internally, it is taken as a tea. Take two teaspoons of the fresh seeds and cover them with boiling water, simmer on low heat for five to six minutes, remove from the heat and add two to three amaranth leaves and allow to steep for thirty to forty minutes. Two cups per day should provide relief from a number of skin problems.    Super Strawberry Facial If you have a chronic problem skin, try Grandmas Super Strawberry Facial. It takes a little while to prepare, so you have to plan ahead. About four hours before youll want to go to bed, combine a cup of mashed strawberries in two cups of white eider vinegar. By the time youre ready to go to bed, it should be ready. Make sure you strain out all the solids and keep the liquid. Apply liberally to your face. Dont worry, it dries quickly. In the morning, rinse your face with warm water. Its as good an astringent as anything you can buy. Your face will feel clean and tight. It shouldnt be long before you can kiss those pimples good-bye.    Make An Astringent At Home Blackheads respond well to lemon juice, a substance with wonder-ful astringent properties. Rub lemon juice over the blemished skin before going to bed and rinse with cool water in the morning. After a couple of days, you should see definite results.    Vinegar is a mild acid and cleans the affected area, reducing bacterial levels. Apply apple eider vinegar with a cot-ton swab and allow to stand for ten minutes before removing with a mild soap.    Youll find cucumber toners in most expensive lines of skin care products. Cucumber extract soothes skin and helps dry out acne. Juice a cucumber and apply it to your blemishes with a cotton ball. After fifteen minutes, rinse your face.|`|Nj58Vi62aa	Go to your doctor ! i did and i was so glad, she gave me something that cleared up my acne in like a week :) and your parent's health insurance should cover it, mine did !|`|6aawDPkSaa	to shrink pores wash your face with cold water. first wash it with some foam or whatever you use. use warm water ro clean out the pores, and then finish off with cold water to close them.     tea tree oil helps as well, and you should really look after you're eating. and drink plenty of water ;)|`|qxJYZfqnaa	anything with benzyol peroxide has done wonders for me...you can get it at walgreens..its a blue box|`|gzHmSs2Xaa	Acne Complex Kit from Sephora  FACT: 90% success rate|`|HrvuoxFtaa	here's some (:  alot of them are kinda freaky, stuff you wouldnt actually find around the home often like rosewood but there's some effective and easy to find ones (:  http://www.ultimate-cosmetics.com/beauty...    i used to dab vinegar on my spots before i got proper acne cream, thats pretty effective although it doesnt smell great x)  goooood luck!|`|MdaxpwLGaa	Your best bet is going to see a doctor and getting creams and tablets on prescription. There will be plenty of home remedies on google. Tee tree oil is best for skin i think =)|`|6cXIg3jjaa	I used to always mix cornstarch and a couple egg whites together. Sounds really gross but the cornstarch shrinks your pores and helps smooth out your skin, put in an equal amount of each and just mix it. Try to apply it with some kind of brush too cause its a really strange substance and let it dry but just let it sit and dont move around to much or  let it drip, it's hell to clean up if you get it everywhere if it dries.Hope that helps :)

bvZHEAwLaa	Bunions - Hallux Abducto Valgus  Back to: Foot Problems & Conditions    A bunion is a bony lump on the inside of the foot next to the big toe. When aggravated this can cause a bursa, which is a sac of fluid that becomes inflamed, red and sore.         Hallux Abducto Valgus    Causes    Bunions occur when the big toe is forced into a position contrary to its normal alignment. This can occur through continuous standing and walking which weakens the anterior metatarsal arch, causing the foot to become flattened and the big toe joint to project inwards. Pressure is then placed upon the projecting joint by the shoe, which creates a bursa (hollow pocket lined with fluid) that becomes inflamed when aggravated. This lump on the inner foot can become red, swollen and painful if left untreated.    Bunions are common in professions that involve continuous standing and walking, e.g. Police, Postal Workers, Hairdressers, Waiters. Women tend to be more prone to bunions due to their choice of shoes which are often high heeled, narrow and unsupportive.    Other causes:        * Obesity        * Pregnancy        Prevention & treatment    Wearing non-constrictive footwear can prevent bunions. Avoid shoes that are ill fitted, have high heels or pinch. Invest in shoes that are supportive, have a wide fitting toe, low heel and good quality insoles.    In addition to following the advice above regarding sensible footwear, bunions can be treated with anti-inflammatory medications. Cold compresses, massage and foot soaking are all methods in which you can relieve painful bunions. Good palliative measures consist of reusable gel pads, adhesive padding and orthotics that reduce pressure to the problem area. Depending on the severity of the problem, surgery may be necessary, although cortisone injections and orthotics are a useful starting point. (see Podiatrist/Chiropodist or GP)    Make an appointment with a Podiatrist/Chiropodist if you are concerned about bunions. We highly recommend this if you have diabetes, arthritis, neuropathy (loss of feeling in the foot), or vascular insufficiency.        * Supportive shoes with wide toe, low heel and good insoles        * Use anti-inflammatory medicine to manage pain        * Cold compresses and massage can reduce swelling        * Reusable Gel Heel Cups and paliative Orthotics or Insoles        * Visit a Podiatrist for advice and treatment|`|JduQHocdaa	STOP POSTING THE SAME QUESTION!!|`|HPGfxvmmaa	well...... u can see a foot doctor|`|wGrRvFePaa	Well, go see a doctor about it. A foot doctor, I guess. But don't worry... when they say "great bone structure" they mean in your FACE, not your FEET. Unless you want to be a foot model =P|`|11c41195f8de0e2ac608f129bf5bda68aa	hey. i was in the same circumstance as you. my extra bone ended up being a tumor. but yours also might be a bunyun. i advise you to go back to the doctor & bug them until they give you answers. but in the meantime, you should definitely wrap your foot at night, and soak it in WARM water, not cold. ice will not help. it will only make your bone more fragile!
A7ovwP94aa	I assume you want the concealer for general blemishes rather than eyebags or spots as you have not indicated what you want it for as concealers are designed for different things.    Here are some for blemishes that have had good reviews;    Collection 2000 Illuminating Touch Light Diffusing Concealer Pen  Rimmel Hide the Blemish Concealer (according to Marie Claire a favourite with makeup artists all over the world)  Revlon Colorstay Blemish Concealer For the Face  Maybelline New York Cover Stick Corrector Concealer (winner of Allure 2007 beauty award)    Estee Lauder Disappear Smoothing Creme Concealer (expensive but someone stated it lasted them for a year as you only need a tiny amount  someone referred to it as the best in the world.

It was about $5.94 at Walmart.|`|f81f10b71c0edf435454d00610984f80aa	My favorite is the Almay Clear Complexion Concealer.

Or I would even recommend the Almay Smart Shade concealer...it's good for redness and dark circles under the eyes.|`|Fb0Ch8Kxaa	the MAC select cover up concealer is really good. they have a good color selection and its only 15.50 $US.

	Honestly, my Guatemalan exchange student that I had last year.  She was (obviously) Hispanic, and had dark straight hair. She was very girly, and talkative, so I think of that personality.  Is that your name? If so, what is your personality like?|`|	"Gaby" makes me think of::  1.) the Gerber baby  2.) the angel Gabriel    =]    those were the first 2 things that popped into my mind when i read "Gaby".|`|	Honestly it made me think of Desperate Housewives straight away!!    xo|`|	CHUBBY PERSON..  UMM..  Yea|`|	It makes me think of the gabby from desperate housewives. so it kinda makes me think of someone who talks alot|`|	A beautiful angel...xxx     Same with LOLA btw.|`|	Of this mexican chick who is really annoying. >.>|`|	A girl with brown hair who's unbelievably nice|`|	a girl with black  long hair it reminds me of an itallian girl to be specific.|`|	A dark-haired person who is slightly annoying and always looks childish|`|	someone who talks alot|`|	a really bubbly happy girl with dark hair :)  what do you think of lily? i know it's kind of like lola, but still.
aYICSwMpaa	Hi    The best thing to do is buy magazine. Look at the celebs and fashion pages and just copy them.    Everyone always tells me they love my style but to be honest all I do is just buy all my clothes from jane norman! hehe!!    There are good make up videos on you tube from like girls showing you how they do their smokey eyes etc. Have a look you will probably find these really useful!    Give your self a new image. A new hair cut and colour (ask the stylist what she thinks will suit you) If you feel like you look good your confidence will come!!!    X|`|b82ybE3gaa	Ok so beauty isn't just on the inside, but it mostly is just not caring what people think, I don't think i'm beautiful but I get hit on all the time and people tell me they wish they could have the confidence i have. SO just take care of yourself good hygiene care what you look like, makeup hair, and just "know" you look good|`|iLAABPGDaa	I'm not perfect, nobody is... but here are some tips:  shave legs, then put on vanilla lotion (or any scent, but studies have been done that guys are attracted to vanilla)  straigten or curl hair,  wear a medium amount of dark brown eyeliner with :  fair skin = gold/peach eyeshadow  medium skin = gold/brown eyeshadow  dark skin= tan eyeshadow  neutral lipcolor with a slight gloss looks natural  Dress tastefully with colors that suit you  and walk with your head held high, and your shoulders back, DONT CROSS YOUR ARMS. it makes you look insecure.|`|oJ8V9rgiaa	OK. I just clicked this to see all the losers who say they gots it but really don't. I am one of them losers. LOL.  Girl we all wish we could be:  ~Stuck up  ~Snobby  ~Teachers pet    Sorry. Ha ha You would not want to be one anyways! Take my sister for example. She is probaly giving you cr@p on this question right now!  Good luck.|`|ikekDCRxaa	Don't try to fit in or copy someone else's look. Its fine if you take ideas and make them your own though :) Remember no one actually is perfect, lot's of popular pretty girls are very insecure about themselves. You could experiment with make up and hair if that makes you feel better, youtube has heaps of "how to" videos.|`|78Xb7enMaa	I will share the best advice anyone ever gave me - act 'as if'. Whatever the situation act 'as if' you are the most beautiful, intelligent and interesting woman in the room. It really does work (but takes practice) but you should not go as far as to be arrogant, other people believe you actually are confident and that confidence is attractive. Those women you think are beautiful and perfect are probably plagued with the same insecurities the rest of us feel but don't show it.|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Ok ya no one is perfect hun, and the only way you could come close is to make makeup your best friend. I'm so serious. You barely find those natural looking beauties, and since you think of yourself as ugly you need to wear lots of makeup, have awesome hair, and have a rockin body. Abercrombie and Hollister are your friends, and coach is your mommy.|`|O1vln7aNaa	Hey :)  So If You Want To Be Beautiful and confident all you have to do is  1.Have Fun...I would never be confident if i didn't have fun!  2.Experiment in styles  3.Be Stylish and be girly  4.Make up and hair = Most Important  5.Share things with friends     :)   Hope I Helped x|`|PLA1OFY3aa	well how is anyone suppose to help with no pictures. give me a picture to look at and i will help. =))|`|qmMpYHSCaa	makeup?|`|tUW3tR2vaa	fake it until you make it..    but really just think positive  and it'll reflect from the inside out|`|mQlYlQ4Paa	**** inner beauty its how you present yourself remember the 3 S's short,stylish and sexy x|`|51Edy7s6aa	Beauty and confidence does comes from the inside.    First things first, for other people to see you as beautiful, you have to see YOURSELF as beautiful too.  Smile, be friendly, walk with your head up high, look at people in the eyes when you talk to them, these are all examples of being a confident woman.     A beautiful woman is a classy woman. She doesn't wear revealing, flashy clothes, or cake her face in make up, and jump on guys whenever she gets the chance.    Websites, tip, tricks, and advice doesn't instantly make you "beautiful", like I said, it comes directly from the inside.|`|HTBwNGkQaa	Okay, I am a pretty confident girl so I'll help you   It depends on your style. I you wanna be stylish just read fashion magazine and fashion blogs. : it is important and your first step to it  Look at what celebs wear and how they do their hair. PS: long hair is feminine, sexy and stylish. Pick a har color that suits you, your skin tone and eyes. Go to a salon for advice.  Makeup helps A LOT. Don't hide your bad features; exentuate your best features. And dont use TOO much make up or you'll look like a piece of cake. Pluck EYEBROWS!!!!!  lol And just be yourself and you'll be confident. It's a clich but it's totally true. I used to be pretty and at the same time not being myself and it was bad cause I had no self esteem. I was dressing revealing just to have boys attention: dont do that.    And if you have to lose a few pounds: eat healthy and do an hour of exercise per day :)    CONFIDENCE: my trick is telling me everyday, every time I step into the room that I am the prettiest girl out there and that nobody could be better than me. It will help and you'll eventually believe it :) and who knows? maybe it is true|`|ROmGmlVSaa	You want to be confident, but you disregard the advice "just be yourself". Confidence is from the inside, beauty (at least, the beauty you're looking for, is on the outside).   Funny thing is, if you have a lot of confidence, but no beauty, people find you arrogant or disillusioned.  Just beauty and you'll be vain.    Put them together and you're suddenly conceited.  Just be happy. I'm not saying don't wear make-up or nice clothes, just feel good about yourself. Don't keep aiming for this type of confidence that just does not exist- most beautiful girls are still self conscious.|`|5nwDq07Uaa	Surround yourself with people who make you feel like a million dollars, who love you for who you are and vice versa. Make sure you get as much sleep as possible as this helps your mood and make exercise a habit. You don't necessarily have to go for a run or hit the gym, but maybe some window shopping or hanging out with friends or swimming! This keeps your endorphins up and makes you feel good, you don't need to have the goal of losing weight. Keep your nutrition up and you will feel good inside and out.    What makes me feel sexy is a good set of underwear, a great bikini and a good pair of jeans. I'm a size 14, so I'm not exactly small, but what kills most girls' esteem (that I know) is not being able to look good in any of those, so find any of those that you love and you know you'll wear and you're set.     Also, being able to turn a deaf ear to those who are critical (and most likely jealous) is something you need to get used to and once you jump over that hurdle, you'll be fine. Good luck hun!!|`|e7dF2Dplaa	well your gonna have to hear it over and over again you cant be beautiful and confident unless you believe in your self, that's what make you sexy being confident. once you are confident no one in the world can put you down... and get this straight no one in the world is perfect..so be the most beautiful, confident and perfectly imperfect person out there... and be your self not what others want to see.....i had the same problem once but now im all i want to be....hope you take this advice|`|sUiY9vDWaa	errrm  yeah cz ppl can actually answer this question u r either pretty or your not n im sure u r u just hav low self esteem prehaps if u didnt waltz round sayin ur ugly u wouldnt b belivein it|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	Do you know what Susan, as a woman who is neither beautiful to all nor confident, I can assure you that I am the norm!    Women are their own worst critics.  Even a gorgeous woman can often be heard to say that she need this or should have that.    I'm afraid I can't make you more beautiful in your own eyes, nor make you more confident if you are not confident.    But rest assured that the confident girls of which you speak are few and far between!|`|nxeffjjKaa	well i just act confident even if i don't feel like it, ill never let it show  example: if i'm wearing a really bright stand-out shirt and some are making commments/jokes i embrace it and say like "yeah and it;s freaking amazing! your just stupid and don't like it" or joke around with them    whatever i wear i usuallly have to like   and i stragihten my hair and makeup everyday  and i wear clothes that accent my features  no i don't mean my boobs or butt  [but i do that too]  i mean alot of people mention they like my hair up so i do it once in a while so that it'll bring more attention  and i have brown eyes so i wear alot of gold,purple,green eye shadow to make my eyes pop  i shave my legs weekly  always were a really pretty but subtle smell  flirt with guy even if they are your friends  be differnt and not another face on the crowd|`|3qLIRorjaa	Sorry...i guess some of us have it, and some of us don't.............|`|DySUxIn4aa	Just do your hair and make up on how it flatters you, and wear appealing clothing that shows off and compliments your body.|`|yLY8B4scaa	i agree with Champange.  you sound like one of those desperate wannabee's on tv shows that want to be popular. its kind of funny. being popular isn't everything. it's all in the personality.|`|wXV5GxJHaa	just play with make up and you hair all the time. look up hair tutorials or make up tutorials on youtube.com they've taught me everything i knnow :]

qDzbijzoaa	well yeah any form of moisturizer well work. don't tell no one but i sometimes put lotion on my lips. lol|`|kUE3Ddktaa	Yes, absolutely! Lots of people use Vaseline on chapped lips because it works well and is pretty cheap. You can also use it on other dry skin - cuticles, elbows, heels, etc.|`|Pi8KfmOxaa	yes i always use it in winter|`|1FqJyyjaaa	Vaseline is good for chapped lip.  A good trick is to put it on before you go to sleep and then when you wake up in the morning your lips are really smooth and unchapped.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes, that's the best thing for them.<br>  <br>  for best results<br>  <br>  put it on everynight before bed. works great|`|19DLoSbBaa	That's what vaseline is for...|`|2v60zG5Faa	yep i use it all the time but plenty on before bed n it heals them xx|`|zZ9UbXJwaa	Vaseline will work wonders!<br>  Brush your lips very gently with your toothbrush and luke-warm water first. This will remove dead skin, then apply away with your Vaseline!|`|wPT33kEUaa	it won't moisturize your lips it will just protect them from the weather, mix some lip balm in with the vas it really works i do it all the time|`|qkLqlW4Caa	yah that seems to work on pretty much everything :) it heals most things|`|oQL9eDNAaa	Yes, just keep applying it and they'll be fine.|`|le0LsiVUaa	YEAH MAN<br>  that **** works on everything|`|2KAqLbqiaa	Yes. And Aquaphor works well, too.|`|ZiEjD7XHaa	yeah works pretty well : )|`|9UdRq4M1aa	Yes it will. Also you might want to exfoliate your lips. You can buy lip scrubs but if you don't want to splurge any money you can apply a little Vaseline and take your tooth brush and gently rub over your lips. Then rinse is off and you're good to go.<br>  Hope I helped a little:)|`|AA11725139	Vaseline will seal your lips but to really add moisture, a little extra-virgin olive oil works better.
SfE5XOH4aa	youre adorable.  just by that picture you can see that your confident.    next time though, try taking the picture from another angle.(preferably from above)  put lipgloss on and a slight bit of eyeshadow.  you have gorgeous teeth, youre so lucky! :)|`|SZ9BNWVIaa	you're okay.  xx|`|zTiaGyuMaa	I think you are pretty and honestly would not change anything|`|aGiLZ6hJaa	Cute hair :))|`|YOKJP1evaa	UGLY    EDIT: You asking us to be honest so there you are.

BtGy5AFFaa	I scrunch and ALWAYS let it dry naturally.  If it works for others, fine, but I don't care for the dryer/diffuser.|`|EMcrAAn6aa	No, I think that normally people just scrunch it and let it air dry, otherwise the product can have a bad affect on you're hair.|`|1o6bzLVbaa	watch this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPCFN3JBE...|`|lsFveRfFaa	you  use the diffuser to scrunch your hair, just add the gel or moose that you use to it then use the diffuser and scrunch sorda at the same time!!|`|bezgko8Zaa	you dont blow dry it. and you dont add so much conditioner when you scrunch your hair. just a small amount, scrunch it and that will do it. usally so much conditioner on your hair, prevents it from drying normally and thats why it might look puffy and weird.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Nope,ust dry naturally :]|`|c395f9b923e5867e12ec729455cee920aa	Well i have tried to do it but my hair is naturally sraight && cannot be scrunched!

T2n1ufNTaa	All of these piercings have become really clich. Its like the "in" thing to do now is not to get anything. But if you must, here are some tips that I hope might help.    If you have a big nose, the nose ring won't work, if you have really thin lips, the lip ring won't look right either. If you have a big flabby stomach, the ring will look really funny. If none if these apply to you, then either one will do. O and for the lip ring, its usually the right side that gets pierced.

0ujpiBTCaa	If you do it without shaving cream make sure the razor is brand new, never been used, and make sure you use a lot of soap. Otherwise prepare for some terrible rashes.<br>  Shaving cream would be best, particularly the first time, but you don"t have to have it.<br>  <br>  Make sure you talk to your parents about this and why you want to do it. I think 13 is plenty old enough.|`|c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Talk to your mom. You don't need shaving cream. Body wash is fine.|`|gnCiGSjbaa	Use condition instead of shaving cream or soap. Make sure your razor is brand new. Use a soft touch (don't press too hard), and shave the opposite way your hair grows.|`|YkLAFRAxaa	start shaving please help the enviorment anddd you dont have to use shaving cream buttt it makes your skin softtt:)|`|2v60zG5Faa	i'm 13 n i shave them firstly but a PROPER razor maybe venus or summin like taht n use shaving cream but u can always grease up ure legs with soap xx|`|e2facf0a453208536391b6d4d3f72b15aa	Try using an electric razor to start, otherwise, have someone teach you.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	You don't need shaving cream, but it would probably be easier your first time to use it. Can you talk to your mom about this? I'm sure she would be understanding and help you get all the right tools. You will need razors (I would try Venus brand razors, they are a little more expensive, but they are really nice and would be better for your first time since you will be inexperienced) and shaving cream. You can take a shower first and then shave, or shave while you are taking a shower, whichever is easier. Make sure your legs are wet and have been exposed to water for at least 5 minutes so that the hair is soft. Shave from right above your foot to your knee, and then swish the razor in the water each time. Then do above your thighs and your knee. Good luck, make sure you don't press too hard! And only shave up!|`|cfkuPoMaaa	Yes, just do it. Shaving your legs is not a big deal at all and you're at a good age to start.  For your first time i would use shaving cream.  When you're good you can just use soap. For your first time i would also recommend using a 3 or 4 blade razor (for a closer shave). Just remember to shave in the opposite direction of the hair growth.|`|E4TQE4RVaa	If you feel that you need to, go right ahead.  I started the summer between 6th and 7th grade.  Use shaving cream until you can do it without cutting yourself too much, and then you can probably just use soap.|`|HYaqGYOEaa	always use water,<br>  never dry shave, or else you get razer burn *ouch!<br>  yea, just use alot of water and soap,<br>  i like usieng shaving cream the best, it leaves my legs extra smooth<br>  <br>  hope i helped:)|`|Lb15XHvBaa	Is this something you have talked to your mom or dad about? How about an older trusting adult? This is the right age to do it and it would be best to do with shaving cream, yes but soap is great too.|`|yySMMojnaa	u dont need shaving creme, just just alot of soap and water!

OvsgyxxDaa	garnier fructis makes this really light serum that makes your hair shine and smell beautiful!!!!! and so does pantene! you can experiment with different ones because theres a lot! :) also you can do a at home egg treatment thing. you can use 1 or how many eggs you need for you hair and then pour over dry or damp hair and then leave it in for at least an hour (longer the better) and then rinse it out with COLD water (heat will cook the eggs!) don't shampoo cause that will just take out everything you just put in, and you can condition if you want. prob. just the ends though. then your hair will restore it's shine! :) or you can try getting shine shampoos/conditioners.|`|2diobki7aa	Sunsilk products work great!

PCs1BRrxaa	use color safe bleach and buy some of the detergent for colors  i get my soap from costco and don't really use bleach, but my mom might when she does laundry    seperate your clothes like this:  1) whites (plain whites, w/o symbols/ print, and grey foot socks are okay)  2) mediums (ie. light pink, light blue, yellow, tan...)  3) darks (ie. red, navy, black...)  4) towels and sheets-- dark towels and light towels seperate if possible  5) delicates (ie. sweaters, silk, cashmere,  weird fabrics, panty hose if your a girl)    How to wash  1) hot- regular or permanent press cycle  2) warm- reg. or permanet press cycle (warm-warm setting if there are options)  3) cold- reg. or permanent press cycle  4) cold- permenent press cycle, use woolite; hang dry, put on no heat setting on dryer when done on drying rack    Always adjust the amount of water and add soap before the clothes|`|VrjF986Aaa	heres stuff i do:  if it doesn't smell, don't wash it  wear under shirts so you sweat on the under shirt and the outer layers stay clean  get a tide pen to take out stains (always take them out b4 you wash the clothes)  use cold water in the wash (better 4 the environment too b/c it uses energy to heat water)  get a gentle laundry detergent and make sure you follow the directions on how much to use, using too much can fade your clothes  always follow the care directions on the tag  get really special items dry cleaned|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	Depends on the fabric I guess, but maybe you should try ironing them? And try not make your clothes too dirty and if you keep washing it it'll lose the color and look kind of old. And always hang them up nicely or fold them.

That sounds kinda, LA/American-ish!    Without worrying about how you look, you can become uncomfortable in later years if you jog in a regular bra. It won't offer you the right support and your figure could suffer later on. It really depends how long you jog for though. If you feel comfortable with a regular bra, go for it.    If people in your area do it, and you are happy with the way you look, then do it. If it happens alot in your area, the boys must be used to it by now!    Something with more solid support might be more flattering to your figure overall though. Good luck.

Even though there not great to use all the time, I started using a tanning bed. The best way to get the tan you want is for the first two weeks to go 3 or 4 times a week, you will be surprised. Then twice a week after that. If you really want to look nice, even thought they are expensive the lotions they sell in the salon do work. But just so you know, you look very pretty just as you are. Good Luck ?|`|KjF0p72naa	Aveno is very gentle and not orangy at all! Jergens brand is also good, just make sure either (since they are lotions) are applied evenly and given time to dry (about 5 mins as stated on the lable). Jergens even has different tones for if you are fair skinned or already pretty tan. Start with the lighter shades and give it every other day (after you shower and shave) applications for best, mild but noticable results.|`|LjqoMHMJaa	You are Irish like me.

tusCN8zpaa	dye your hair dark. Like jet black, it highlights your skin tone. Making your base color dark is key. Women make the mistake thinking lighter hair color would make you look washed out. I made the mistake, so I need to dye my hair jet black lol, my hair is naturally sandy brown.  Like beyonce, she looks better with darker hair, the blonde washes her out.

sHUnctqIaa	If it smears after only a short amount of time it's not really that great.  I like powder eyeliner, or a dark eyeshadow mixed with a little drop of water or saline to make a liquid, stays on way better than the pencils and it's easier to apply. Or, use a eyelid primer under all your eye make-up, it will keep your eyeliner from sliding around. Bare Minerals makes one from $16 and Urban Decay makes one for $16. I like the Urban Decay primer potion better.|`|evmzwbyHaa	YOu could use liquid eyeliner.on both bottom and top.when yOu use the pencil eyeliner it does tend to smear a lot.many people find it very difficult to apply liquid eyeliner.practice at it and i guarantee yOu liquid is a million times better,it'll stay on longer.|`|VKLyDiQ7aa	I really like Avon's ULTRA LUXURY eye liners.  They don't smear unless you smudge them yourself (with hands, brushes, etc).  And they are on sale right now too!    An industry trick for models and stuff is to take an aresol hair spray, close your eyes, hold it 10-12 inches from your face and lightly spritz yourself with it.  Your makeup will hold all day!|`|Flrnnme1aa	The best liners that I have had experience with that I can guarantee it will not smudge is the followig:    Bee luscious Cosmeitcs    Luscious Eyes Eye liner with aloe and chamomile or thie    Luxe Cream Liner ( must be applied with a flat liner brush)    http://www.beeluscious.com
ARycuiedaa	its okay i once shaved half of my eyebrow, and im only 12! just keep using the makeup and it will grow back on its own. dont use any serum, becaus there is no way to make ur eyebrows grow any faster than they naturally do.
PS2JLw6eaa	it'll make a subtle difference. It will turn out a medium brown. Usually your hair can only go about 2 or so shades lighter unless you bleach it. And since it's a golden shade, it will add gold tones to your hair.
HlcCJq0naa	Honestly, if you are tall you should really get a dress that either shows your legs a little in the front or back, or a shorter dress to emphasize the fact that you have long gorgeous legs. As for the top/ back I would go more for an open-backed dress with either straps or strapless. A halter might cause you to lose your neck a tad bit. Definitely go for the dress that YOU personally feel the best in. Also! A full-coverage in the front dress could help that area, or even one that cuts low with a "V" shape. Scoop-neck dresses, however, tend to be made for cleavage, so if that's what you're avoiding go for the full-coverage!    Examples:  http://www.myformals.com/gallery/photos/...    http://www.myformals.com/gallery/photos/...    http://www.myformals.com/gallery/photos/...  Hope I helped in some way!|`|PS2JLw6eaa	If you have a boyish figure, you need to create curves and boobs.    Try belted styles, wrap dresses, dresses that show off your shoulders, like halter dresses. Also, empire waist dresses help creates the illusion of breasts. Try V-neck dresses, and ones that define your waist, and make it look small. Details at the waist and A-line hem.    This site has examples of dresses that works for a boyish figure:  http://www.osoyou.com/lists/797.publisha|`|zkR4IUa8aa	Strapless empire waist, preferably with beading or something around the bust/waist area!

AA10297143	Flawless legs, is there such a thing?  Anyway, if it is a lotion or cream you are after, I recommend Nuskin products.  Actually, my wife is the one who swears by this company, and it is only available through distributors or on line.  You can check it out at http://www.nuskin.com and good luck.|`|NbanwBYMaa	Exfoliate your legs when you can - use a body scrub in the shower or a body brush when your skin is dry. Body brushing is great for getting rid of those red pimples. Always apply moisturiser to your legs and body after showering. Make sure you have a good quality razor.|`|T2n1ufNTaa	Make sure you always use a new razor every time you shave your legs. Always make sure that you lather while doing so, if not , that can be the cause of the red pimples you get on your legs. For scars, try cocoa butter but keep in mind that no scar can ever be completely removed and treatments will always leave a trace.

But just too let you know you should probabally go soon to but it because our winter clearance has officially ended, which means that things are pretty much gone, and whats on sale is pretty much all that is left, so go get it now if you want it|`|Ovpghwujaa	honestly, it's just a store.  it's not a matter of life or death, so if you like the sweatshirt then you should buy it.|`|WrVbB5rsaa	Well uh if u told people ur hate hollister then u wear it one day then they would think ur trying to fit it or something. But i think if u didnt tell anyone or u really want to. You should go for it!
Flrnnme1aa	Anything higher quality is better than the cheaper quality or drug store brands. Hoowever MAC is quite over rated its a good makeup dont get me wrong but it is much thicker and has a tendancy to clog pores and give you small area break outs.      An excellent high quality brand you can try is Bee Luscious Cosmeitcs hypo allergenic and amazing wear and colors.|`|QGU7JAIUaa	In my opinion mac makeup is the best makeup out there. They have so many different products which come in different affects and shades. For me the other cosmetic companies are a bit bland and not as unique and different. Ive been using mac for quite a while and when you've turned to mac you cant go back lawl. It is rather expensive and it uses up most of the money im given so i try to use less of the product every time i need it so it lasts longer. The other brands which i quite like are clinique and benefit but they have sort of the same price range as mac does :/     (: x|`|Br3k7Hagaa	It depends what you like. If MAC works for you keep with it and yes I think its worth the money :) Because if you think about this way; if you like MAC and its good quality and you have no problems with it then its good. But if your paying lots of money trying to find other stuff its going to work out more if you think about it.|`|5PBK1Nc6aa	heres some things that cannot be found for a lower price with the same quality as MAC:     most eye shadows  Liquidlast Liners   Lipsticks   Pigments   Paint Pots|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	I've never tried it, if it's that good then i wouldn't know.  Personally cheaper ones to me seem better, [Y].|`|eHUXcYZhaa	In my opinion it's not worth it. The eyeshadow creases really easily and doesn't last long. Cheaper alternatives are barry m, rimmel and max factor.|`|Sr2mS8Xoaa	depends what you wanna buy from MAC, overall, Mac makeup is one of the best! and its totoally worth it!!|`|AA12057913	yes its high quality makeup|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Yeah its good stuff but some things you can buy that are just as good but cheaper.    I do like their colour range however for eye shadow etc and it lasts a long time too so its not so badly priced.    The amount of cheap make up you can buy and have to throw away cos its rubbish and doesnt do what its meant to or doesnt stay on etc... it probably works out about even!|`|gQ8D2rhjaa	It really depends on your makeup style  i am super pale and their foundation really works for me, so i use it.  but for eye shadows and other makeup, unless you love/need those super bright colors mac and only mac make i don't think its worth it. mac is really good makeup but  there are allot of good colors out there for a lot less money, so really just look around.|`|1ioI2py4aa	its amazing and also personal choice. i love it|`|evmzwbyHaa	I disagree MAC is one of the best brands their is.but it also depends on what yOu wanna buy.mac eyeshadow is totally worth the money.but liquid eyeliners and mascaras  can be bought for less.victoria secret make up is a lot like MAC. At about the same price.i think jUst like $1-2 cheaper.|`|f81f10b71c0edf435454d00610984f80aa	Geez. It's your extra spending cash...if you're completely satisfied with your purchases, don't worry about it.    I think most of the MAC shadows are worth the money although I do think the lip glasses are overpriced (I still buy them because I really love some of the lip colors ^_^). What I like to do is I buy my everyday, neutral, wearable colors from MAC (Vanilla, All That Glitters, Twinks, etc.) and when I want really bright and funky colors to play around with or wear when I go out, I get them from NYX. Many of the NYX eye shadows have the same quality or even sometimes a better quality than some MAC shadows. That way I'm not spending a ton of money on colors I won't wear everyday or use regularly.     But yeah...if you're satisfied with the quality of the MAC products you buy, then of course it's worth the price.|`|mp5Vg7Peaa	I sing mac's praises but when it comes down to it its up to you whether you think its worth the money or not.    if you feel bad about how much money your spending you can find less expensive alternatives that can be just as good , remember just because its more money doesnt always mean its better as I've found out a few times but I do tend to stick with mac and benefit :)|`|bgi0AtiFaa	i've only bought eyeshaddow and powder. the eye shaddow lasts forever and it's super bright and their foundation powder is like a miricle to blotchy skin.

AA10297143	Your pores are filling back up after you squeeze the blackhead, therefore causing the blackheads to return.  You may need to check with a dermatologist, or find creams and products suitable to your skin.  My wife uses Nuskin, but it is relatively expensive and not found in stores.  You must find a distributor, or become one at http://www.nuskin.com and yes, you really should stop squeezing them.|`|sHUnctqIaa	There red beacsue those pores are not infected with bacteria, likewise a blackhead "scrub" will only irritate them more. Use a cream cleanser like cetaphil to help calm your skin down, it will help with the redness. To heal and kill the bacteria, use a product with Benzoyl peroxide or antioxidants like vitamin A, C or E. To prevent those blackheads from coming back keep your hands off your face and wash with a gentle cream cleanser every evening and morning. Follow with a rosewater and aloe toner and a moisturizer. keeping your skin in balance will prevent you from forming blackheads by retaining oil. If you want to treat the blackheads use a spot treatment so you dont dry out the rest of your feet. It's also benificial to exfoliate 2-3 times a week with a scrub contianing Jojoba beads or a glycolic acid product.|`|eimToBI7aa	Most of my blackheads either dont come out or hurt a lot to get out!|`|AA12206467	try baking soda it acts as a exfolliater for the skin and will also help balance the ph level of your skin....also hydogen peroxide in the brown bottle with a cotton ball after the baking soda will help get rid of the red...if you continue to use a bit of baking soda a couple times a week will help control your blackhead breakout....and if you notice a red bump also try cortizone it will bring the swelling down...make sure you are not allergic to the cortizone  try the lowest dose....good luck to you|`|2U0zfDIkaa	first of all stop picking at your face you could be causing the blackheads by doing that and also don't use a black head scrub too often because that could also be causing your skin to breakout because your stripping the natural good oils of your face and that causes your skin to produce more oil which causes greasy skin so anyway...i would recommend a baking soda scrub it's really easy just wet your face and hands then take some baking soda and put it on your fingers and gently scrub your face with the baking soda make sure to rinse it off thoroughly.  =] it makes your face soo soft and smooth i do that once or twice a week depending what time of month it is lol and that should take care of it =] oh yah always moisturize after washing your face don't forget!!! i like to use johnson and johnson baby lotion with aloe and vitamin E it makes my skin soft so good luck!! XD|`|VgRy6jxuaa	A great face scrub should help eliminate blackheads. As for the red marks, try Acne Free Terminator 10. It's used for on the spot pimple control, but is also great at getting rid of the redness in pimples.|`|OBdys7Pzaa	After you squeeze blackheads they would leave red marks but you should just wash your face normally and in a few days they should go away.
AA11215737	I do not put any cover-up on your forehead, that will make it worse.  Use some pro-active to ex foliate.  You can thin you eyebrows a bit, but that's it really.  I think girls look best without makeup.|`|GZqLIv4Saa	I'm guessing you like the natural look? <br>  <br>  Well, first I would suggest that you go to a salon and get your eyebrows fixed. If you like them that way, then by all means, keep them thick. <br>  <br>  Secondly, I think that you should get a concealer stick/foundation. Don't buy a creamy/liquid foundation, because that makes you break out even more... opt for a mineral foundation/concealer stick. However, don't depend on those products to have clear skin. Eat healthier, drink lots of water, exfoliate twice a week and use a deep cleanser everyday to clean pores. Don't forget to moisturize with a product containing spf 15. Having naturally clear skin is way prettier. <br>  <br>  Get a brown eyeliner, and line underneath your lashes. Don't line your whole entire eye, though. And then smudge for the ultimate natural look. Also, get a clear or brownish black mascara (black looks more dramatic) and coat just the top lashes. And if you want, get a nice, light brown eyeshadow to make your eyes pop. Oh, if you want something that's not so neutral, opt for a nice purple or blue shade. I find that it makes brown eyes stand out the most. <br>  <br>  And as for the lips... honestly, I have a tray full of lipsticks and lipglosses, and I love the colours, but I don't wear that much of it because I hate the feeling on my lips. What feels really good are the chapsticks from Nivea or some soft lips products. They're both really good, and give you a nice but subtle shine while moisturizing your lips. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|cfkuPoMaaa	Cover up (green for medium skin) It sounds sooo weird but it covers up acne amazingly! <br>  <br>  blush Nars blush in orgasm (expensive but soo worth it)<br>  <br>  Mascara<br>  <br>  Only wear cover up / foundation where needed.  Make sure you wash your face and moisturize with an oil free and hypoallergenic moisturizer.  Tented moisturizer is Always a good option, just be sure to apply it more like a foundation and less like a moisturizer.  If you rub it in like a moisturizer it will look really splotchy. <br>  Good Luck!|`|JMs4RDVxaa	I would suggest a light mineral foundation, such as Bare Minerals. Look into some natural-colored eye shadows that will bring out your eye color, and mascara as well, if you're going for a more natural look. Maybe light blush and lip gloss? I may not be the best person to answer this, I'm sixteen and I like my makeup heavy haha. But just as a suggestion. :)|`|OlIGqmMNaa	You could wear a little bit of foundation to even out your skin tone. Maybe a little bit of eyeliner (not too much) and some mascara.

JBvLMBRzaa	blow dry them ,  then when you sleep pin your bangs to the side to "train" them to stay in that position . That is what my stylist has told me to do .|`|In1UqryNaa	It starts with drying.  Blow dry them with a roll brush, than you can try a straightner and slightly curl the ends or 1 1/2 inch barrel curling iron.  Some times hair sweeps to one side better than the other so experiment with that.  Lighly spray, and brush out.  I love TIGI masterpiece hairspray.  It holds but doesn't look crusty or cakey.  Brushes out really good.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	have them cut w a razor. itll break them up more|`|p8CzrFM6aa	If your hair is curly, hate to say it, but that whole look doesn't work. If your hair is straight, the only way to get them to work is to get them razored at a salon... this thins out the edges and makes them fall better into position. To shape them, pin them to the style you want when your hair is damp, let them dry that way and then take the pins out.

You do this because the warm water opens up the pores so the medication can get deep into your pores. Once you've left it on for five minutes, pat your face dry.    Step two  Wet your face with warm water to keep the pores open and massage an acne scrub all over your face. Now rinse. There are little micro beads in the scrub that remove dead skin and the pimples      Step 3  Use a toner and pour it on a cotton ball and rub it on your face. Let it dry. The toner has a salicylic acid that clears pimples and gets the wrinkles off.    Step four   Get an oil free lotion and rub it on your face. Let the lotion dry. The salicylic acid that you just applied can dry out your face and you need to keep your face hydrated. So use an oil free moisturizer to keep it healthy.    Step 5  Use an acne spot treatment to clear up your worst pimples. Believe me the medication it uses really works.    -use a hydrating acne mask once or twice a week leave it on your face for ten minutes after applying.  -change your pillowcase every week. Oils from your hair and skin deep into your pillowcase while you sleep. Search for a pillow case that is 100% cotton. Cotton doesn't irritate your skin and was it every week.  -put your hair up every night because the products you put in your hair can clog your pores every night and make your acne worse.  -get plenty of sleep  -take lots of vitamins and minerals  -eat healthy  -exersize  -stop popping pimples. This can leave scars and even make acne worse.       How pimples form  All the pores on your skin are actually teeny tiny hair follocules which produce oil to keep your skin naturally moisturized. But it can produce too much clogging your pores.    getting rid of scars>>>>>  ________________________________  step one  Apply sandalwood paste with rosewater and leave it overnight over the scars. You can even apply a mixture of sandalwood paste and black gram paste.    step two  For dark acne scars use lemon juice. Before applying, clean the scars with warm water and dab 1 tsp of lemon juice into a cotton ball and apply it on the scars and leave it for 10-15 minutes. Make sure to apply sunscreen prior to going out in the sun as lemon juice makes your skin photosensitive.    step three  Cucumber with lemon juice or honey with lemon juice also helps. Honey also helps for chicken pox scars. However people with oily skin should avoid the use of honey.    step four  Apply a paste of gram flour, curd, turmeric and lemon juice and leave for 10-20 minutes  Mix 1 tablespoon each of sour cream, yogurt, grinded oatmeal and few drops of lemon juice. Apply it on scars and leave for 10 minutes and rinse.    step five  Gently rub baking soda paste on your scar for sixty seconds and rinse off. It acts as micro dermabrasion treatment for your skin.    step six  Apply smashed pineapple on your face and leave it for 10 minutes. Wash it off with warm water. It will help in fading acne marks as pineapple contains ascorbic acid.    dark circles>>>>>>>  _______________________      -sleeping eliminates dark circles under your eyes. not getting enough sleep is what causes dark circles. maintain getting up and going to bed at the exact same time everyday including weekends. make sure you get 7-9 hours of sleep each night    -dark circle can also be caused by allergies. if you know you have allergy issues then get a doctor to prescribe an allergy medication.    -Because dark circles under your eyes, and other skin problems, can indicate a vitamin deficiency, skin creams containing vitamin K and retinol (vitamin A) can repair and restore your skin and reduce the appearane of dark circles under your eyes. Applying such a cream overnight is an effective way of treating your skin for longer periods of time.    -take lots of vitamins. not getting enough vitamins can cause discoloration under your eyes. add more vitamins to your daily diet. take them about 2-3 times a day.     -stay well hydrated! staying hydrated is very important for your skin. it makes you skin sooo healthy. it's not just great for dark circles but the other problems you mentioned too! drink water as much as you can  ____________________    hope i helped|`|w3H1REhlaa	Clearasil Blackhead scrub, cucumbers for dark circles, eliminating pop and chocolate helps breakouts.|`|it6k7rx0aa	Theres A Really Good Product By Neutrogena.

I found the best way to get rid of those horrible blemishes is to swap over your products, e.g. For a month you might use nivea, after that you might use Benzac AC, and so on.    At the moment, I am using Nivea. I use the 3 minute self heat mask 3 times a week, then I use the peeling solution 3 times a week. In between, I use just their normal face wash.    Since I started using different products, it really helps. I only get the occassional pimple when I've gone to a party and eaten heaps of crap or when I'm close to getting my period (it is natural for it happen then because of hormone imbalance.)    It helps to stay away from wheat and dairy products as much as possible, and eating a balance of good fats, carbs and fruits and vegetables.    Also, you need to get enough sleep. Try to get to bed around 9:30 each night, 9 if you have trouble sleeping. This should give you enough sleep for the next day. Good hours of sleep help get rid of your skin problems and also help get rid of those  dark circles under your eyes.     Make sure you get plenty of vitamin C!!!

LBHJaqXoaa	First, your complexion is light enough that all colors will show up on you. Now, to know if he or she is good enough to do your tattoo you'll have to look at their portfolios. Keep an eye out for darker complexions in the photographs. Ask them if they have ever tattooed a darker complexion and if so, how did it turn out? If I were you, I would focus on the quality of art coming out of the artist versus whether or not they've done darker skin. We've already established that you can be tattooed with color. Now just find an artist you like and go for it!|`|	You don't look that dark....so... you'll be fine. Just make sure the place is clean and your artist can't be rude at all! Then, you're good to go.  http://z.about.com/d/tattoo/1/0/_/u/doz0...  Thats an example.  here's another  http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LaJoT32kSGQ/SI...|`|	The most important question is to ask to see their portfolio.  Ask them if they have tattooed black people, and ask to see the results.  A good artist will not feel pressured or like their talents are being questioned, most artists appreciate someone who is coming in and wanting the best they can offer.  Your skin looks perfect for tattooing.  It's light enough for any color to show, and, your skin looks healthy.  Look around, and make sure you find what's right for you.  Have fun with it and best wishes!|`|	Trust me, it would definitely show up. I know people way way darker than you and their tattoo shows up nice and pretty.
DuQbL7VTaa	Here are mine:]]     Eyeshadow:  ~How to apply:  1.)Take light-shadow and apply from lash to brow.  2.)Take warmer-shadow and apply from eyelash to crease.  3.)Then take darkest shadow and apply across eyelash.  ~Always remember lighter on bottom and darker on top~  ~Apply some eyeshadow to the lower lid if not using mascara.  ~Using mascara will make eyes more noticeable.  ~Brown eyes: Blues, Purples, Pinks, Peaches, but no SHINY COLORS~  ~Green/Hazel eyes: Golds, Khakis, Bronzes, Pinks, but no BLUES~  ~Blue eyes: Icy colors, lavenders, grays, but no GOLDS OR BLUES~    Lip-gloss:  ~Always remember that braces with a shiny lip-gloss will ruin a look.  ~Don't apply more than two coats in between 30 minutes.  ~Remember a lip-gloss's color will always fade its the shine that will stay.    Mascara:  ~Is it true that mascara ruins your lashes?  1.)Actually, mascara does not ruin your lashes.  2.)Regular use of good mascara will not make lashes fall out.  3.) If you use clumpy, cheap, or waterproof more mascara than twice a month however it will make your eyelashes fallout.  4.)Only use nice non-clumpy mascara brands such as Cover-girl, Maybelline, Almay, and other famous mascara brands.   Eyeliner:  ~Do not use colored eyeliner without mascara because then the eyelashes look bland.  ~Be careful with liquid eyeliner because many incidents can occur.  ~For example: you can get it in your eyes, or if you apply too much it will give a harsh look which you don't want to set.  ~Finally don't apply eyeliner to the inner part of your lid.    Nail-polish:  ~Nail polish all depends on your skin tone.   ~Olive Skin: Hot Pinks, Browns  ~Peach Skin: Light Pinks, Purples  ~Pale Skin: Browns  ~Tan Skin: Hot Pinks, Creams|`|g4WDGlgxaa	How NOT to get lipstick on ur teeth:    Apply lipstick  Press lips together on a tissue  Re-apply lipstick  Quickly run your tongue over your teeth|`|zhbBIlbyaa	what she said. :)

Your best bet would be to have one made for you.|`|QnSKaBcjaa	Have you looked in thrift shops?|`|jYMvwuXyaa	www.jovaniprom.com    www.jovani.com    www.bcbg.com|`|gaihXB5Iaa	I read it all.... I'd like to help but you'd have to be here.  Good Luck.|`|NWa45ZDIaa	I liked what Tanya said!  I would try ebay, for real, they would probably have the most variety.  Thrift stores carry a lot of vintage clothes too.   Or like someone else suggested, you might have to have something made.  OR you could buy something close to your description & have it altered with vintage accessories/styles etc.  & one more suggestion:  Learn how to spell "and"|`|ZTpGUIDoaa	http://cgi.ebay.com/STUNNING-PROM-EVENIN...  http://cgi.ebay.com/Stunning-Prom-Evenin...  http://www.4prom.com/promdresss1720.html  http://www.davidsprom.com/dresses_detail...  http://www.debshops.com/Fashion/ViewDeta...     Ok theres a few! have fun at prom and i hope i helped!|`|fle8hQrAaa	OK, so here goes.  You will NOT find a Victorian-ish type dress that is STRAPLESS.  Victorian style did not allow for bare shoulders and frankly the outfit you are discribing sounds hideous unless you wanted to GOTH it up with black net stockings and heavy makeup.  Now then, that being said, you may find a nice Victorian style dress which will not be strapless but more likely will have a lace section at the top with a high lace collar.  This would look lovely with your cameo.  That would be something you would find likely at a Thrift shop.    Personally, I think you should just forget about the whole Victorian thing and go for a really cute style that suits someone who is small like you are...and with red hair...avoid pink.  If you want a full skirt on the dress, check out sales on bridesmaid dresses at Bridal shops...seriously...    Good luck.    Good luck.|`|VrjF986Aaa	you aren't getting answers b/c nobody wants to read all that
yuHV59Yhaa	You can kinda see the label on the back if you look really close. But they don't look very high-quality. I would just get them from the UGG website if I were you.|`|A9EydXySaa	i have fake uggs.  and my sister has real ones.  they hold up the same...anless your that concerned about the label on the back of it.
hR1HHCzRaa	Yeah, they're way comfortable and feel really nice to wear so I'd def recommend you get some. You can either get the normal spandex looking ones which I much prefer as they feel really smooth and soft on your skin. The latexy ones prob look better but don't feel quite as nice. I'd say get both and make your own mind up! Best places - american apparel are best and loads of choice, but topshop are good too and slightly cheaper.|`|VrjF986Aaa	you must be pretty daring to be a guy and wear them...    but more power to ya  they are a little less comfortable than regular leggings b/c of the material, but they aren't UNcomfortable    i got mine from american apparel|`|aYICSwMpaa	Hi    Yeah they are comfy... They are really stretchy so move with you.    Best place for them is Newlook.    X|`|d4BPoMPwaa	yea there really comfy ;)|`|A8q1jK9paa	They are really comfortable  I got my first pari from new look but after you wear them once they go horrible and baggy so i got another pair from Urban outfitters which are so much better   so if your gonna get them get them from urban outfitters :)  :)|`|2QpCk8V8aa	You look like you'd suit them!|`|iBeyNiEdaa	I've never worn them so I don't know if they're comfortable but I've seen them in New Look (:  x|`|vxFz4qNlaa	yeah on the inside they are just like normal cotton material. dont worry its not leather on the inside lol!  go for it;)|`|LE3FVetiaa	they are lovely and great to wear !!    I got some from New Look but as cheap and crap as it can be - Matalan do some good pairs at only 6 !!    Go for it :)

That is a very cute black dress. Its $49.90.

zDe47rREaa	well, i put on some Vaseline on them before I go to sleep. It doesn't make a dramatic difference, but it did make my eyelashes a lot thicker within a month.|`|mKvJTYAbaa	Put valseline on your eye lashes everynight x|`|EQv5CBSeaa	Esolica Double-Lash  Switzerland's Double-Lash is the only night treatment specifically formulated for lengthening, thickening and protecting eyelashes. Contains a special multi-protein that works overnight to immediately bond splitting and restore thickness. Meanwhile the exclusive moisturizing ingredients condition dry, brittle hairs to make them softer and more luxuriant. Just brush it on at bedtime, and within a few days you'll notice a fuller appearance and less "flyaway". In just three to four weeks, the rich nutrients begin to promote healthy, consistent growth. You'll show off naturally long lashes instead of slathering on the mascara. Use nightly for best results. Safe, sterile and non-toxic, it won't irritate sensitive eyes. Also works to thicken sparse eyebrows. Comes in a convenient brush-on applicator.|`|x3FSLkp3aa	vaseline|`|4npjIcPaaa	get an eyelash curler and you can make them look longer. you can find them at a local CVS/Brooks|`|OsT64mqMaa	I don't think that's possible. Some people are born with thicker ones, just like some are born with thicker hair. There's nothing you can do, be happy in your own body.|`|g4WDGlgxaa	you could try eyelash dye to make them darker but I don't think it's possible to make them longer and thicker without mascara.|`|rY7TKWdsaa	use a eyelash curler but if you going swimming its going to go away. and you cant get them thicker.

You will often find that that skin will be raised. It shouldnt be raised a LOT LOT, but if it is that means its probably getting brushed by something a lot. If I rub my tattoo on my arm, blood flow will increase and it will become a little more raised. Nothing abnormal about it.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	It doesn't sound infected to me. What it sounds like is the artist went too deep there and it's causing a little scarring. Good news is that it will go away. Bad news is nobody knows how soon it will go away. Just keep doing everything you are doing, because you're doing it right. If it worries you too much, go back and ask the artist who did it. He or she will be able to tell you more about it and help determine if you should see a doctor. But I think you'll be alright. Just a little scar tissue.

So does Estee Lauder.  Eyeshadow- Once again, Cover Girl. LOL.  Powder- I use Estee Lauder.

sHUnctqIaa	It depends on the kind on foundation brush you have, if its a full coverage bushy brush like a Kabuki brush then your good to go, if it's flat and wide and sleek, then it wont work.   It's best if you start out by buying the B.E. starter kit. It's $60 and comes with a Kabuki brush (normally $28) a concealer brush (normally $20) and a flawless face brush for blush, warmth, mineral veil, etc. (normally $22). The kit also comes with 2 shades of foundation, warmth which is an awesome contour color, mineral veil which helps set your make-up and absorb oil off your skin and a skin care product called skin rever-upper which contain glycol to even out skin tone, heal acne and reduce fine lines. You get a ton of stuff that will help you look fabulous and it's a great value.   You could just buy a foundation for $25 and a brush for $28 (Kabuki) or $30 (heavenly face brush, higher quality). There's nothing wrong with that, it's just that the starter kit is such a amazing value.|`|8uUpAKPtaa	If you buy the starter kit it comes with the brush, but if you're just going to buy the foundation separately, you'll need to buy a brush, a regular foundation brush will not work.|`|mhqsiiNXaa	You need to buy the special brush. It costs about $28 dollars for the All over Buki Brush.

Avon's startup fee is 10.00. You would have to purchase your books, bags, and if you want to give out samples. <br>  Its good to get books so you can give to everyone you know, leave at tanning and hair salons (if allowed). doctors offices, colleges. etc.|`|NLxcfGplaa	I am a mark rep.  just started a couple weeks ago.  You have to buy the magalogs and samples if you want.  I don't really make money because I use the money and buy myself more makeup.  It is really good.  You pay the $20 and they send you some starter magalogs and a starter kit (with makeup brushes, mascara, a juice gem gloss, and more)  it is a great starter kit!!

It's what other stuff you put with an outfit to make it your own. Fashion is way of expressing yourself.

64O0ydUfaa	I absolutely love the light blue jacket!!!  Its so cute!  Don't go for the regular colors like white, gray, etc. because other kids will have the exact same jacket, and those colors would be most popular.      xox Emily c:|`|nvYt8FV7aa	theres only 1 link!!|`|npUcIJH5aa	Ya its ok i guess.|`|L9b7sUbFaa	as in which color?    if so then the dark blue is the cutest    :)|`|vsbuV9wCaa	The gray.  white gets stained too easily and the gray goes with every thing.  all the other colors are just ugly, in my opinion|`|23tJgbMdaa	most deff the one in dark blue (luna), its winter-y and cute!|`|bWfeKRB1aa	The white and the blue one looks good!

I'm sure ONE of these stores has a dress that looks lovely on you and everyone at the banquet will agree.

I know I have a hard time shopping online because I don't feel like i can really see the clothes for what they are.|`|6kiL9hBXaa	Ok, I don't think you know what you want then.  You've looked through so many websites that there's virtually nothing else left  I suggest you look into fashion design yourself and perhaps sew a dress for yourself.

c815f0954f0cc607a22f3e49bfd31b48aa	Well unless there are other employees with piercings, you can't really say it's directed towards you. Also, when you work for someone you are representing their business and it is reasonable for them to want you to look professional. If you want to be able to have whatever body art you like, you may need to consider a lesser job. I mean I don't know where you work but most places aren't crazy about body art. Sorry.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	if you plan on flipping burgers for the rest of your life? thats o.k. with me. you dont see sucessfull people with thier eyebrows pierced? the higher you go in life, the more mature your supposed to be|`|DBu1AzjHaa	company policies need to be enforced equally, consistently and fairly.<br>  <br>  However, in this economic enviorment, it may not be wise to fight a battle over it|`|B6cOlFU9aa	What kind of company do you work for? Are you face to face with customers? If you have been working there for two years, its a little strange that they are only now asking you to remove your piercings.  Do any other employees have any facial piercings? If they are asking everyone to remove theirs, then I would say just go along with it if you want to keep your job, but if you are the only one who is being asked to remove your piercings, then this is not fair at all. I'm not sure who you contact about this, but that would be cause for discrimination. I would talk to your boss first about why this is only being directed towards you and why now after two years. I sympathize, but maybe its a new company policy. I wouldn't want to lose my job over a few piercings, but it certainly isn't fair if they are discriminating against you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Rn7zkS52aa	Are there other people with piercings and tats at your place of work? Are they being asked to remove the piercings as well? Generally any place where you work is not going to want any type of piercings, it looks unprofessional. The rules are subject to change at any time, and even if it's not formally in writing at this time, you have been asked by your boss to take them out, which you should just do. I would remove them, and not give a hard time about it. The only thing I would ask is if there was a change in policy because you were hired and have been wearing your piercings all along. I'm sure something has changed in the mindset of the company and they are not okay with it anymore. Either way, whether it's a policy or not yet, you need to take them out if you want to keep your job.|`|h8OqX12Haa	i think thats it kinda mean my moms friend was fired from her job cause she had a nose and eyebrow piercing she worked there only for a month but the boss didnt had any problems with that at the beginning i dont know what happened then <br>  you can use retainer for the eyebrow piercing i dont know if they make them or not but i heard it works <br>  i think that its stupids and kinda mean <br>  it should be toward everyone that works there not only "forced" at one employee|`|JMLzwsFRaa	As your employer, they do have the right to request you remove the piercings.  Now if there are other employees with facial piercings that are not being asked to do the same, I would speak to your boss about the matter.  Do it professionally and find out why this is only applied to you.|`|prlMQgDLaa	why don't first you try putting in clear retainers and see if that helps. Plus find out if this going to be enforced company wide.|`|b6kXDYnKaa	its all about employability lets take a look shall we first off your a boss of a big company and you are doing interviews today the first guy comes in with tattoos,ear,eyebrow piercings and lip ring and all the good stuff <br>  dose not have his diploma slouches in  the chair and aks about pay roll and benefits and the second guy comes in you can see the piercing but dose not have them in dressed in a businesses suit shows manners whats until you bring up pay and benefits and know the interview is over you need and employee who are you going to hire  the employer is not looking to get to know you nor the customers they want some one that looks good  tattoos show the employer that it is a sing of recklessness so if the employer ask you to do it you better do it unless you  want to get fired a|`|cfkuPoMaaa	No, if you were hired and were not told about this policy your should NOT have to remove them.  For one tongue piercings should not be a problem. Your eyebrow one may be a little more noticeable, but is there a way you can cover it with your hair? Technically if it is a new policy you have to follow it, or prove to them that you can cover it up properly. sorry good luck|`|oUtex7ckaa	If it's a new company policy then you are correct in that it should affect everyone equally and not single you out.  However, whether or not they do enforce it fairly and equally you should still comply and remove the piercing while there.  I understand it can be frustrating but it isn't worth it to lose your job over something like this.
zifSoY34aa	if you are comfortable with it YES! that's the first rule when it comes to prom dress. And you can wear big- chunky- bold colored accessories to make the whole outfit more interesting (think angelina jolie at the oscars).|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I love it. Would definitely be perfect for prom!|`|yXGlmUqlaa	yes it's perfectly fine. and it's a gorgeous dress.<br>  <br>  you can also really play it up with accessories with this one.<br>  i'm sure you'll look great
sHUnctqIaa	Chap stick and mascara only if you must wear make-up to the gym. If your doing a good workout you should be getting pretty sweaty which means your pores will be open, making it easier for your make-up to clog them. Likewise, foundation can start "melting" off when you get hot, and i think that looks grosser that no make-up at all. I hate when I see the girl on the treadmill that has make-up all over her tee shirt and towel from wiping her face. You might as well not wear any at all. I live in a small town so when I go anywhere I'm bound to run into someone I know, so I get that, but most people won't notice a huge difference, honestly. If your going to Yoga or Pilate's that's one thing, but if you are doing a cardio workout and getting a  good sweat going its best for your skin if your not wearing foundation. Maybe try a tinted moisturizer if you have to, or be sure to wear a high quality mineral powder foundation if you insist upon cover up your skin. Either way, as soon as your done wash your face good and re-apply make-up if you have to.|`|qOKFuXfLaa	I do not wear makeup to the gym  its stupid, you're going to sweat it off anyways  and i do not go to the gym to meet people  and, chances are, if i bump into someone i know, they wont be wearing makeup  it's so kid-ish to wear makeup to the gym ... sheeesh|`|2diobki7aa	I don't really work out, but if I did, I'd probably just wear some basic makeup. You know, cover up, mascara, and lip gloss. For the same reason you have: in case I see someone I know.  If you want to wear your makeup, go ahead! Who cares what people think. That's their opinion.   :D Best wishes!|`|WbQAhDg3aa	I think it is pretty stupid. If you 'bump' into someone on your way to/at the gym then i am sure the person will understand. Besides you look more like you are serious about working out if you don't wear make-up.|`|lPCjNkEnaa	I think that if you've been wearing it all day you shouldn't go out of your way to take it off, but if it's not on, don't put it on.|`|d8iBD5aSaa	if i go to the gym after school and have makeup on from the day then i wear it but on the weekends when i go in the morning i don't wear anything. at the end i get all nasty and sweaty so why would i try to look pretty? haha|`|6Pg8vpOvaa	LOL can you say insecure    so basically you are saying that your a  very ugly and the only way people think you look the best is with makeup    that makes you look fake and un natural    im not saying that a little makeup is bad but uh ever heard of accepting yourself and you are and not trying to cover up?|`|5nwDq07Uaa	These girls are crazy. Don't wear foundation AT all. You'll regret it. My skin has never had any problems, but once I wore a little bit of foundation to the gym and my skin broke out like a mofo!    If anything, I'd recommend a waterproof mascara and a waterproof eyeliner. Strictly waterproof, for obvious reasons. A flavored low shine lip balm/gloss is perfect for keeping your lips hydrated, but sometimes promotes blackhead growth under the lip, so use a little bit.    Don't even bother with eyeshadows,  etc etc, you'll end up looking like a bigger idiot than when you started.    Good luck!|`|VgB7JYVBaa	I just wear mascara and foundation. Keep it simple. :]    If you wear a lot of eyeliner OR eyeshadow... it will run since you're going to be sweating.    Like I said, keep it simple and "natural".    PS- I never go outside the house without makeup.|`|qM1qoDhCaa	Back in high school I use to wear fountain to track meets and practice. People use to question me the same way. I was hardly the only one doing it though.    But like you I just felt more confident wearing it. Personally I don't see any problem with wearing makeup to the gym.
Qgg6i6K7aa	I loved my makeup. <br>  I went to beauty salon and all of the products used were MAC.<br>  I would get it done the same again for anothere special occassion.|`|MfcTIdlraa	When I was married, (all three times)  I did my own make up.  I prefer to go mostly light on the scale.  My complexion is fair and in good condition, so I find that a little moisturizer under a base with powder, blush light eye make-up and some gloss does me better than anything I have had done by a pro!  That's TOO overdone.<br>  Thanks for asking.

qkLqlW4Caa	i have the same kind of hair - or I did and I got it cut where my bangs cross my forehead and then mix in with my hair and then I got like a shaggy look where it is a little bit longer than your shoulders but it has ALOT of layers in it so it looks really good :))|`|ZNZMWrCaaa	I think maybe a full fringe would be nice, then wehn it grows out a bit you can convert it to a side fringe, this means you wont have to keep getting it cut. <br>  make sure you specify exactly what you like to your hairdresser though, mine always gets my fringe wrong coz im too vague...<br>  good luck im sure u will looks ace|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	If you have a heart shape face then you need a fringe to frame your face properly as your forehead will be bigger than the rest of your face and make it look in proportion if it oval then go for a side sweeping fringe

They are obviously jealous and rude. I think you're pictures are totally cute and very pretty.     Don't change a thing for anyone. Your great just the way you are!|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Keep your mouth closed, lose the black eyeliner.. seriously, you're way too pale for it, use gray/brown if you so desperately want to wear it.|`|DySUxIn4aa	Hm..well the black eyeliner isn't really doing anything for you. Try a different color like brown or gray. And maybe some foundation or cover up on the pimples so they're less noticeable. After all of that, I'd give you a 5/10.|`|9LDGmQ4Aaa	You're really pretty. :) Anyways, some brown eyeliner instead of black would be better, and if you really want to stick to black, then you should blend the liner a little bit. Also, some lipgloss or chapstick.|`|qWcw4Vz2aa	your hott|`|1AYFp8aoaa	no    you could shut your mouth for starters|`|1ScInnZRaa	Prettier than you, you nasty girl.

They're so pretty and big! Lucky (:  But all together you look pretty, definitely not ugly. I think if you wore a little makeup like added some color to your face then you'd look less plain.

Dd5YdYFFaa	For the lips, i personally dont like eyeliner, so maybe trying a lip stain or gloss that isnt a nude or light pink, maybe a darker pink or so...also add extra gloss to the bottom lip and that should help.  For the eyes i would wear black or brown eyeliner on top upper lid, top inner waterline to define, and about halfway across the lower waterline, after you line it with a white pencil or shadow of some sort, also add white shadow or pencil to the inner corners of your eyes to make them pop :)  any color green shadow will look great with your dress and looks great with brown eyes. Make sure you use a eyelash curler instead of fake lashes just incase so they dont look over done if your concerned about that. :)|`|zhbBIlbyaa	okay well then for the eyes you can apply a light color on the inner corner and put the same color just under your brow but don't for get to blend it out! also for your lashes go with some false lashes... check youtube's julig713 for tips (she's really good at that kind of stuff). anyway also for the lips go with like a bright red or a bolder color since the eyes should stay a little bit more neutral. Use red lipliner to fill in your lips and you can also go a little bit outside your lips to make them seem a little fuller. Follow with a little red lip gloss.|`|taYFAwlzaa	Ok for eyeliner, dont line the inner. Just near the outer. and use white kohl. and for mascara do the same thing.  Lip liner..  ehh not my fav thing ahah|`|1ioI2py4aa	you sound lovely and i love the colour of the dress that you described. put a small amount of highlighter on your cupids bow and use light shades of lip gloss/lipstick. to make your eyes look bigger and brighter, outline them with a thin line of black or brown eyeliner. practise before the dance so it looks perfect on the night|`|maQTi6Aeaa	Generally, darker makes your eyes look smaller, as does lining them all the way in and beneath your bottom lashes. For lips, apply the color or balm you want and them apply something with a little sheen or shine dapped right in the middle. It gives the illusion of larger lips. Have fun! :)

AA11382475	Hi :)    The best one i've tried that works better than those sold at Krogers is the Extra Strenght GLUTATHIONE with rosehips SOAP. It works really fast, results are seen in just 5 days, it even worked for my dark stretchmarks on the 3rd week of using it. And all my pregnancy lines in underarms and neck are gone.

AA12069058	A tattoo feels like a burning sort of irritating sting. Its not bad depending on where you get it. If your planning on getting it on your breast it might be a tad worse because that definitely is a sensitive area. Just dont go to big for your first one and you'll be fine! Nose piercings do "hurt" but its definitely pain that you can deal with. If anything it more of a sore feeling for the next few days after. Good Luck?|`|zuFJmLhgaa	Nose piercing hurt for a second when there done, and kinda have  trobing sensation for a while after. A Tattoo feels like someone digging a bic biro into you and drawing a picture, depending on where you get it done it can be bearable..    O and a tattoo on your breast, not so attractive..|`|07qFHL6iaa	I really don't know but my advice...DONT GET ONE! It's not as attractive as people think or say they are. Its a horrible choice... but it's none of my buisness...|`|QnSKaBcjaa	to me they feel like someones scratching you realllly hard. it souldnt hurt as bad on your breast cause its got more padding.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	To me, it feels like a cat scratch at first, then my endorphins kick in and I hardly feel anything more than a buzzing sensation. But everyone is different. It may or may not hurt. It all depends on you and how well you tolerate getting a tattoo.    When I got my nose pierced, it felt hot, and a little pinch, but it didn't hurt. It was sore for about a week, but it didn't really hurt at all. But like I said before it all depends on you and how well you tolerate piercings.     The only way to know if you can do it is to try.|`|5RoYyprkaa	i've got five tattoos and a nose ring.    tattoos to me, feel like a kind of dull razorblade scratching your skin.  a nose piercing... well, it hurts, it stings pretty bad and your eye waters, but that's it.|`|JvnY8mstaa	quote from sign at my tattooers:  "yes it hurts, you might cry, now shut up"  if you're gunna get a tattoo..you have to know it's gunna hurt like hell and not care cuz you love the art and form of bod mod. i actually LOVE the way it feels..prob more mentally than physically but it's seriously different for everyone! i know a full grown man who almost passes out but insists on still getting tatted. just get it and then its another experience :] dont freak yourself out about it though.   nah nose piercings dont hurrrtt...crybabies. lol kidddingg :-]|`|2Ol0i5fqaa	No no no please do not get a tattoo on your breast.

But as for how a tattoo feels, mine hurt alot, i can't descirbe how it felt at the time but i remember it only hurt when the needle was on my skin. After the tattoo was finished it felt like someone 'slapping sunburn' or ykno when you have sunburn and accidently rub your skin somewhere!    Nose piercing i have one of those too :) mine honestly didn't hurt, i have a high pain threshold for piercing's, it ached a bit afterwards but was worth it!    Good Luck in whatever you do tattoo-wise :)|`|1ce2c1a2a116c1da8b2971ce6d7aca0daa	i dont know about the tattoos BUT  nose rings: it barely hurts. feels like a pinch and then throbs for a while. sometimes it will bleed, sometimes it will not. even if it does bleed it  is not a large amount of blood. often only the eye on the same side of your face as the nose piercing will water because it is all connected somehow.|`|B56wTXSGaa	the best way i would discribe it would be like somebody trying to cut you with a safety pin or a tack. but i think they feel different on different parts of the body. the outside of my forearm was actually relaxing. but the inside of my elbow (where you get blood drawn) was pretty painful. and i also had an 8 hour session one time that was a range from not-that-bad to holy-fcuking-siht. but you have to understand that the pain is more of a rite of passage. it makes the tattoo mean more.
AA11477561	I find that most Indians wear dark eye makeup and not much other makeup. They have a bright face, maybe using a little bronzer, but mainly focus on their eyes. They use kajal on their eyes, which I believe is something like eyeliner, so maybe use some black liquid eyeliner?  This website is pretty good with Indian makeup. It has a bunch of pictures of different looks:  http://www.indianmakeupdiva.com/|`|ZoQUI1NEaa	the same as any other person    1. black eyeliner  2.mascara  3. a dark foundation  4.bronzer  5. red/or dark lipstick/brown/black?   or just clear gloss  hope i helped xo

AA10297143	Squeezing them and using a good lotion afterwards might be the "cheapest" way, but I actually don't recommend squeezing them at all.  Clean and exfoliate your face often is the real key.|`|d5065693519b5b048f87de49a76bf961aa	I've had incredible results massaging with low cost natural oils. It quickly and permanently got rid of my blackheads as well as my pimples and scars and I now have a totally blemish free, healthy and glowing skin. The secret is to massage over and over quite vigorously and they will reduce day by day.  Do it with a forward and back motion using finger tips and front and sides of fingers depending where on face you massage. Circular massage is not effective. Try to do 15 to 20 minutes a day(can be in two sessions) for best and quickest results. It's best to tighten skin first. Open mouth about 1", pull lips firmly back against teeth and protrude chin - tightens most of facial skin.  Use olive or any oil.  I have testimonials from happy users     SOURCE(S): 20 + years research, experimentation - safe natural treatments/cures for skin conditions,skin enhancement and anti aging/rejuvenation treatments  ..|`|sOVc08Dsaa	Try witchhazel.. apply it via cotton ball 3 times a day.. it will even your skin.. reduce blemishes and pimples as well.. or a skintoner with witchhazel in it.. also to get rid of black heads you have to extract them.. there is nothing on the market that can help remove them or keep them from reappearing unless it is extracting them.. get some biore strips.. it will help remove them .. you can invest in a small extraction device that can suck them out as well.. or squeeze them out yourself..|`|T2n1ufNTaa	For blackheads, the only thing that has ever worked for me is just squeezing them out. Make sure your hands are clean and you have alcohol on hand to clean them when your done. As for blemishes, Queen Helene's Mint Julep face mask is great with clearing up your skin and tightening those pores. Once a week every week you'll see the difference. And its ez on the wallet too, at only $4 a tube.

p9mB8Z2Kaa	Hi    First, get a.....  -toner   -acne face scrub  -acne spot treatment  -washcloth   -an acne mask       -get it all in neautrogena    Step one  Take a washcloth and pour warm to hot water on it and put the washcloth on your face and leave it there for five minutes. You dothis because the warm water opens up the pores so the medication can get deep into your pores. Once you've left it on for five minutes, pat your face dry.    Step two  Wet your face with warm water to keep the pores open and massage an acne scrub all over your face. Now rinse. There are little micro beads in the scrub that remove dead skin and the pimples      Step 3  Use a toner and pour it on a cotton ball and rub it on your face. Let it dry. The toner has a salicylic acid that clears pimples and gets the wrinkles off.    Step four   Get an oil free lotion and rub it on your face. Let the lotion dry. The salicilyc acid that you just applied can dry out your face and you need to keepbyoir face hydrated.   So use an oil free moisturizer to keep it healthy.     Step 5  Use an acne spot treatment to clear up your worst pimples. Beleive me the medication it uses really works.    -use a hydrating acne mask once or twice a week leave it on your face for ten minutes after applying.  -change your pillowcase every week. Oils from your hair and skin deep into your pillowcase while you sleep. Search for a pillow case that is 100% cotton. Cotton doesn't irritate your skin and was it every week.  -put your hair up every night because the products you put in your hair can clog your pores every night and make your acne worse.  -get plenty of sleep  -take lots of vitamins and minerals  -eat healthy  -exersize  -stop popping pimples. This can leave scars and even make acne worse.     How pimples form  All the pores on your skin are actually teeny tiny hair follocules which produce oil to keep your skin naturally moisturized. But it can produce too much clogging your pores.|`|aBelaWLoaa	best face wash for this: clearacil ultra.   it is the only thing that works.   use aveeno face lotion spf 15 after, day and night.     you can also:   -drink more water   -excercise  -take vitamins  -get more sleep|`|eimToBI7aa	clinique is a load of dog dump!

ydTcGVrMaa	According to the official UGG? Australia website, the boots are made of real sheepskin.  It did not metion the fur, but if you are debating buying them or not because of the killing animals factor, there is your answer.  Keep in mind animals SKIN can NOT be removed withought harming them!  Obviously skinning a sheep means they are killed.|`|4f06382102ace92d536a786ce63c7a5caa	Yep they are made out of sheep. Love them anyways lol|`|UjhWIrJ1aa	Sheep and baby skin is what they're made of.|`|TSSRJyIMaa	yes. sheep|`|qtDtHwFfaa	Actually, it's worse than real animal fur. They are made out of real animal SKIN, without the fur. Instead of merely shaving the sheep to use the wool, which it would easily grow back, a sheep is slaughtered so that its actual skin can be used to make a pair of ridiculously expensive boots.|`|OFNmZbPCaa	the inside is made of sheep skin. but sheep's fur grows right back, and doesn't hurt them one bit. :) believe me im a big animal lover and i did tons of research before ordering my uggs.|`|effyGrEJaa	They are absolutely made with real fur and hide. And if anyone tells you they don't kill the sheep don't know what they are talking about. But the fact is, is there is a huge industry for the meat from the sheep so the sheep are not being killed for their fleece. The fur and hide is used once the sheep has already been slaughtered for its meat.  Unless you are a vegetarian I would say buying the boots shouldn't make you feel bad in the sense that that is not why they were killed.  They are using the entire sheep and not wasting anything it would be much sadder of a situation if the sheep was being killed for its meat alone and the hide and fur was simply thrown out as though it were garbage. I  am a huge animal lover and I would never buy fur ever, but the fur that makes coats usually comes from animals that are killed purely for the purpose of the coat and not for human survival.  I think people have to understand the distinction.  I don't own a pair of Uggs but I would love them but there is nothing wrong with buying fake ones if the fact that an animal did die bothers you.|`|dNun1AVnaa	yes ;( but they look so cute!|`|z1OJIgFRaa	yessss.  but their still cute .

The first hole was just as bad as my cartilage, which wasn't very bad, but the second hole felt like a burning rush and was uncomfortable for only a second! I suggest getting it because it is an amazing piercing! Just be precautious that the healing process is the worst part! It can't get hit on anything, you have to clean it twice a day, it's hard to sleep on, and it can take up to a year to heal!  Good luck :)|`|Au4gWgEiaa	It can get fairly intense.  For me it was the hole near the front of the ear that was the most painful because the cartilage is so thick there.  The second hole was nothing!  Similar to getting your lobes done, though it feels very hot for the first few hours to a day.      Mine bled as well.|`|JvnY8mstaa	not bad.  like a normal cartilidge piercingx2-ish  cuz its bigger gauge size than normal studs....&& its done twice.  they friggin bleed a lot though!  mind was still bleeding down my ear even after an hour and a half.

bTZ4Ba99aa	I have a more oval face too, and i got those bangs a couple months ago, and i strongly reccomend them for your face shape! They will make you look more sophisticated and they will shorten the length of your face, and bring out your cheeckbones.|`|p3GZERIsaa	I think it'd suit you!

Hope this helps!|`|W4yg6w40aa	try ending your shower with a blast of cold water for about ten seconds.    also, you can try pouring a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar over your hair.    try not to use too many products on your hair - they can make it look dull.    make sure you drink plenty of water and eat a healthy diet - take a multivitamin if you need to.    good luck!!|`|XG4TAjcCaa	John Freida frizz ease.    http://img2.timeinc.net/instyle/images/2...    good stuff :)    and no need for buying a new shampoo or anything!

But I think you should just ask him what he wants. And your friend might not even realize she's flirty with him. Don't just assume things right away. Ask them both first what they think and then make judgments.|`|j9SP0xLcaa	Omg i hate when boyz pull this on me! But anyway, yeah, he likes  yah. Don't come on to fast though.
n24KeQ6eaa	According to my brother's girlfriend, it's best to use the conditioner that comes with the hair dye so that it holds the colour and gradually makes the red more intense.     Otherwise, if you did it at a hairdresser, it's best to let them bleach it a couple of days after your original (the last time you dyed it), then let them dye it a more intense colour if your hair is either black or brown. Remember that unless you're blonde, the red will never be as accurate as shown on the box.|`|5Nb98vHtaa	From experience I wouldn't use a blonde, blonde always goes ginger over red and it might be patchy, making it harder to re-dye evenly over to get the colour you first wanted! Usually within a few weeks my hair dye has faded slightly and lightened, but it could just be the brands! Maybe try a brighter red toner? Good luck!|`|bTZ4Ba99aa	I would yeah use a color remover. But i would wait a day or two and see how it turns out because hair color always appears a tad darker after you just color it.|`|vsUZ77AFaa	I don't know if this will help as you may want an instant correction but the red will fade with washes eventually    Hope it helped x|`|OdSrwFcnaa	colour remover

FbuXn5AZaa	if you want it tight fitting get your size, or a nice baggy one then go up a size x|`|OvsgyxxDaa	well since you can't see it or try it on  it's always safe to buy a bigger size!  (getting to small is a waste of money! )  you can always shrink it by throwing it in the dryer for a long time on high heat and/or washing it in hot water  i think you might be able to return it also though if you get it smaller... (not sure, check if you can!)  but if it's a brand you know and you know what size you usually get then get what you know will fit you!  :)|`|xdrzKo2paa	yes, I strongly recommend you do buy a size up from the size you normally wear in tops. If the hoodie is a zip up, don't think twice about ordering up from your conventional size. if its a pull over, you might not want to because they can be awfully long on your torso. Depending on the fabric content of the hoodie, if it's cotton it will shrink. However, if it;s lambswool, cashmere or merino wool it will not.   Best of luck to you!|`|l1iCPVPOaa	you click the size thats bigger?|`|tUW3tR2vaa	if you go with your size it will most likely fit just fine|`|BrkoO6dsaa	Go with a bigger size u dont want it to fit u small.|`|lUPyZgtzaa	errrm it depends on which site you are ordering from..

fMBREYmNaa	is it worth it, it depends on how bad you want the surgery.  Cosmetic surgery doesn't just make you look better it boosts your confidence.  If you have a confidence boost you'll find your self doing new things in new places. <br>  <br>  As for the risks, its just like driving.  The surgeon is driving you around if hes a safe driver you'll be fine but if hes a wreckless driver then there are alot more risks.  Find a skilled trustworthy surgeon who has years of experience like Dr Greenberg and you find your self in good hands.|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Depends which one, it changes. Here is information on the different cosmetic surgeries: <a href="http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/" rel="nofollow">http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/</a>|`|xqQO81Omaa	Depends on the procedure being performed, skill and experience of the doctor, health of the patient, etc.|`|AA11447210	Depends on what you're having done, and the skill of your doctor. Plenty of people find it well worth the risk(s), others have had bad experiences.<br>  <br>  Talk to more than one doctor and do your research on whatever it is you are considering. Armed with information, you can better decide for yourself if it's worth the risk or not.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	I don't think that things like liposuction or tummy tucks are worth it, but some face work, like a nose job, can help improve self esteem if it really bothers you. And breast augmentations can also help boost self esteem. But it is expensive and permanent, so it has to be something that you know you would be happier without|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yes if u wanna look better<br>  its your choice <br>  not anyone eles|`|YUcl70rbaa	Do it! I got my nose done and a scar on my neck fixed....Best money I ever spent. And the pain was a lot less than what I was expecting.

cQJGaUK4aa	I also loved doing hair, it's a tough business because of all the competition out there , every where you look there is a Salon.....This is what I tell anyone who ask me that question, If you Truly want to be a<br>  Stylist, go to Barber School and learn clipper cuts because they teach you perms and colors in Barber Schools too and you should already know how to roll hair....But if your also wanting to learn nails too then you would have to go to Cosmetology school. I had to learn clipper cuts on my own because clipper cuts were not in when I went to school , guys mostly wanted Persision cuts or went to the Barber shop on the Military Base.<br>  Good Luck with what ever you choose.|`|IxOP4qbYaa	Go for it!<br>  I've thought about becoming a hairstylist myself, but I'm only 14.<br>  <br>  Answer mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqFMq3owBcR2PQ03JL4xwf_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225092439AArd12v">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Just do it as a side job<br>  I always thought it would be so much fun!<br>  I cut and style my family and friends hair as much as I can! :)|`|99491e40628ceac4212c4853e1ac294caa	dunno|`|xxSGhywoaa	It's not too bad, but if you do it as, say, as second career, you should do fine.  If you are nurse that goes to people's houses, you could always get your clientelle there and do them while they are at home. I used to have a friend that worked in our local area's Wal-Mart, and he'd bring in buckets of cash in wages and tips. However, on the other hand, two salons in my town, just shut down due to lack of funds.  I don't know if this has to do with the economy, or Wal-Mart.|`|ZEXGmO5Zaa	I think it's a wonderful idea<br>  <br>  I actually know someone who is an RN <br>  works the night shift<br>  and also has a license to do hair.<br>  <br>  She works at a salon during her free time<br>  <br>  People will always need their hair done<br>  and family and friends will support you and increase your clientele<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

If necessary use dress shields.  I went though that stage as a teen & in my early twenties. Keep washed with mild soap & try a mans deodorant.  During the summer I use Old Spice fresh scent.  <br>  The chemicals in antiperspirant clog the pores.  There are a large group of doctors that believe that this may lead to breast cancer.<br>  I personally would rather sweet then take a chance on cancer.|`|iJwDBFYgaa	change ur deoderont . i use secret its solid and it realy helps i used to use that and that exacly happend to me so thats why i changed to secret
ZTNEdFTfaa	No perms or relaxer is healthy Lye or not, but if you must have one then Lusters's Pink New Growth is the best one that I have ever used. Their is a difference between a relaxer and a perm.  Their 3 types of hair treatments you might be thinking about . Perms Relaxers and Texturizers. <br>  <br>  Relaxers aren't as strong, chemically wise as perms are and also they mostly are for improving your hair texture.<br>  <br>  Perms are used to permanently straighten your hair, of course you have to re apply every month.<br>   <br>  Texturizers are very weak relaxers that give your hair a wavy but natural texture<br>  <br>  And the best thing to do is get either a Kiddy Perm like Motions, Soft and Beautiful. and always Opt for the No- Lye.

xqgE4CrBaa	Light brown eyeliner, peachy lip gloss, rosy blush, powder foundation. You're gorgeous!|`|paLHVowyaa	thats not you in the pic right .....like you probably look like her - im just saying because i saw the pic on google umm neways i think a little bit of blue mascara looks nice with blue eyes and lip gloss - a pale pink/frosty pink gloss will look nice with blonde hair ( dont do both together it may look like too much)|`|vLLRONWTaa	You don't need any. You look fine, but if you want talk to a cosmetologist, which is someone who studys makeup.|`|K7vCWru6aa	WOW! You don't need any!

Stay like that!|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I think subtle shades suit you, to really bring out your eyes. Try to get a tinted moisturizer (Benefit have a great one) so you don't look plastered with makeup. For everyday I would say a little touch up where needed, maybe some tinted moisturizer and some mascara with a slick of clear lipstick. You can buy some cheap colours and brushes and experiment with different looks too. Good luck!<br>  <br>  P.S I got the impression you looked LIKE the picture, you aren't the girl in it... But if you are you're gorgeous!
CUEco2LEaa	I would be cautious about it clogging your pores, but you know your own skin better than anyone else. You are really lucky. The benefits of cocoa butter on your face is that it gives you a nice even complexion and makes your skin glow. Be careful about your face become too greasy but if your skin can tolerate it, it is the best thing for it!|`|iLuc1xyAaa	i wouldn't put this product on your face as it can cause skin to break out and be oily. Cocoa butter is mainly used for dry skin and it should be applied to the body cause it is a heavy cream. On the face you should use a moisturiser daily but not a body one. I would take some time to go to the shops and maybe ask a beauty consultant about a good moisturiser for your skin type.<br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	dont put it on your face|`|ugng770raa	I would be careful with anything that you apply to your face.<br>  Personally, I wouldn't.

I used to use 100% pure cocoa butter on my face and I found out that it was making my skin too oily, which was causing it to break out. My dermatologist also didn't recommend putting it on my face.<br>  <br>  Now, that could have just been my personal face and body reacting to that, so everyone could be different. <br>  <br>  You could look into more organic products, like organic face products. That way you know it will be okay to use on your face since it's made for your face and not your body.<br>  <br>  Here are some organic face product sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.saffronrouge.com/site/home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.saffronrouge.com/site/home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eco-beauty.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eco-beauty.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eminenceorganics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.eminenceorganics.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.juicebeauty.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.juicebeauty.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skincareorganix.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skincareorganix.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.skinbymonica.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.skinbymonica.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lilyorganics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lilyorganics.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.burtsbees.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreView?langId=-1&storeId=10001&catalogId=10051" rel="nofollow">http://www.burtsbees.com/webapp/wcs/stor...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out a bit, I'm sorry if it did not, but all the best and good luck! :-)

usbY3Thwaa	You can have ur hair chemically straightend, it can be costly depending on the salon you go to. BE CAREFUL!!! If someone isnt very experianced with those chemicals, especially if u have color treated hair, they can dry u out and ur hair can break off! If ur hair isnt kinky curly and you can get away with washing an flatironing a couple times a week, it is much healthier. If u have a stylist that u trust, talk to them about ur options, how ur hair will grow out after procedure, how often ur gonna have to have ur roots touched up, etc. There is maintenence involved with some straightners, be careful and good luck!|`|6BcgQDGVaa	try hair reborn.|`|iGFjI266aa	i need that too!!! i heard of a relaxer but thats about it!!! ill be back to find out <br>  <br>  good luck!!!

ESAMvi4taa	Take Biotin in 1000mcg doses daily (so 1000mcg a day) for a couple of weeks.  Then, up the dose to 2000mcg.  Continue to increase until you reach 5000mcg (which is equal to 5 mg).  That amount will help with hair growth.  I've been on this for several years.  It works really well, and I recommend it to my clients because it's very safe (it's virtually impossible to overdose on Biotin).  The reason I suggest starting low and working your way up to 5000 mcg is because you may have some side affects like acne breakouts if you start that high (biotin brings impurities to the surface when the levels of biotin in your system spike).  Bringing it up slowly prevents this|`|4CXvw0Klaa	Prenatal vitamins are really good vitamins and are safe for non pregnant women.  alot of doctors prescribe them for their female patients that are child baring age.<br>  <br>  Folicure also makes a hair and scalp vitamin.

Greasy hair is never good and it really can distract you because your hair feels so nasty!<br>  <br>  Buy some moisturizing shampoo and conditioner like the ones from Aussie. Use them every day and start using some Anti-Flat or Frizz serum from Garnier Frutics. This will help your hair be less brittle and dry.<br>  <br>  Also, if you curl or straighten your hair, start using a heat protectant. Any brand will do, just make sure you use it! That can make your hair dry and damaged feeling.
