aHAN2lnLaa	Hola:<br>  <br>  No indicas el lugar donde esta localizada la tienda. <br>  <br>  Creo que por aqui sera un poco dificil, lo mas efectivo es poner un anuncio clasificado en tu area.<br>  <br>  Te deseo mucha suerte y que logres vender la tienda. Saludos.|`|iQizZGgQaa	hola<br>  <br>  De acuerdo con Marie D. Este no es el mejor foro. Te deseo mucha suerte.|`|eBeX7Msxaa	Esto no es una seccion de compra venta!
AA11327323	Yes, maybe you have misread your calender, 27th is marked up as a bank holiday, but that is only for ROI.|`|ZuUAUEY6aa	yes but more details would be handy|`|nb2NGcKMaa	of course why|`|LofOjmeMaa	no they were taken over by aliens at 10am today|`|4Ej32YBfaa	Yes|`|AA11697158	more detail please|`|K84zMLM6aa	Um, yeah, why wouldn't they?
tleXR4KYaa	When you submit a parcel under the tracking service a copy of the tracking number is taken off the slip and this is fixed to the parcel. Another copy is stuck in local Post Office's register. Then the Post Office official stamps the slip and signs it. This is given back to the sender after the fee has been paid.<br>  <br>  Without the sender's slip, it is almost impossible to find the tracking number, unless you know which Post Office it was and when it was sent. If it is a small one, your parcel may be the only one sent that day.<br>  <br>  Hope the parcel arrives OK|`|3f10efdc062c7553650a50749b7e7aacaa	No, you cannot get a replacement number as this has been assigned to the package.<br>  <br>  You will just have to hope the item arrives shortly.|`|4Ej32YBfaa	Postie here:<br>  <br>  No replacement numbers unless it gets returned to sender and they resend it - not likely in your case.<br>  <br>  No-  no way to get the original number as IIRC there are up to 2,000,000 separate tracked items within the RM pipeline at any one time and there is no central location for them to be matched to a particular parcel.|`|ytBI9PwOaa	Im afraid that I dont think there is. When you send something they always ask you to keep the slip safe because I dont think they can recall it if you lose the slip. I hope you can though for your sake! What a pain.

yJ3GpnXAaa	Yes, Tesco.    Go to the PayPal homepage and select the Offers tab (just above where you normally enter your log in details, and slightly to the right of there).    You'll see places you can use PayPal online and some of them give you some kind of incentive, too.    Use the dropdown arrow and you can select Tesco, then you'll have to log in and take things from there.|`|eG5W05Pbaa	NO, DONT THINK SO ANYWAY NEVER SEEN ANY WHERE THAT DOES|`|Ce0WbCPCaa	I don't think they will accept paypal. All I know is Paypal can only be used when buying off ebay...    http://www.pigearnings.co.uk  http://www.pigsaving.co.uk|`|KqIDH7oVaa	i dont know of any that take paypal im curious though if you are snowed in how is the delivery van going to get to you?|`|be484a9719f466a44233d66e8c5f1ae4aa	I don't think they do but check on www.paypal.co.uk for a list of companies that do accept paypal.   Good luck!! x|`|dAjYPMg2aa	Paypal do a top up card where you transfere money from your paypal balance on to what is in effect a debit card which you can use in stores, over the phone or online.  i'm afraid that doesnt help you now as It'll take a couple of weeks to come by which time you'll have starved!
Ce0WbCPCaa	Not all employers are prepared to pay for CRB's. You need to go to CRB's website which you search thru google and it will tell you how to pay as well.    http://www.pigearnings.co.uk  http://www.pigsaving.co.uk|`|AA11423656	Your employer should do all of the work and pay for these costs.|`|Dc4Bsjo2aa	You don't pay for this hun, your employer will do this, its there obligation to do this.|`|Mctjf6Zcaa	Hi Izzy,    In order to get a CRB check you need to go through an agency or organisation, you can't request a CRB check as an individual.  The agency or 'umbrella body' will be responsible for taking payment and as such usually they themselves will pay the CRB themselves (minus their admin fee - as such you'll most probably have to make cheques payable to them not the Criminal Reference Bureau).      There are three types of CRB checks possible - Basic, Standard and Enhanced.  The Basic CRB check will cost the 'umbrella body' about 23.  Please note however that admin fees often range between 10-20.  When I was involved in CRB's the average cost I came across for BASIC CRBs was around the 35 mark, but it is possible if you search around to find it cheaper, though often not worth the hassle.    Best of luck.
AA11651923	Yes, as long as you don't quit a job to move.  You can actually move to a different state and still collect Unemployment benefits from the State of California if you worked in CA and would be entitled to it.|`|5jkHLgClaa	if you are collecting in roseville then you can move. if you quit a job to move you cannot. if your spouse and family moved for spouse  to take a new job then I believe you can quit your job and collect.
Cye1NNWxaa	ebay<br>  or kmart
q8NCrzjnaa	It means the item is in the process of getting charged VAT and/or customs fees.<br>  <br>  You should be sent a letter telling you how much you need to pay to get the item delivered and how to pay.<br>  <br>  Once you've paid I believe the item goes as a standard next day delivery. At the worst it'll be on a 48 hour delivery. <br>  <br>  Just hope the seller of the item hasn't marked the item as a gift, or undervalued it!  As this may then end up costing you more than the item is actually worth, taking into account your original purchase price!!
Pltwn7D3aa	I pay my sitter $9 an hour during the week and on weekends she charges $10 an hour but that is at her place and it includes food and anything my son might need while he is there. I usually only use her once or twice a week. I have never used her for a full day, the most time he has been there is about 6 hours.
