I asked a question a week or so ago, having to do w/ question deletion and a poster said he used to be able to delete questions w/o going thru the reporting process.  He had that good of a reputation w/ YA.  Is he making that up?  It didn’t sound fabricated, he sounded pretty normal.  How do I get that kind of power?  Do I have to start being nice to people?  I want a job like that.

I just got back from MEPS (Military Entry processing Station) I stopped smoking weed on new years eve and haven't even seen it since. But what I smoked was KUSH. I drank tons of water before I would drug test for my recruiter I also way 187 mostly muscle but I do have some body fat not much though. The first time I failed, a week later I passed then the Monday before I left to MEPS  I passed. MEPS was on Tuesday and I drank tons of water before that. They say the drug screening for MEPS is more sensitive to THC My recruiters say I will be fine because they have never seen anyone pass  the test at the office and fail the one at MEPS but I am paranoid and think that Im guna fail because of them saying its more sensative. But its just the fear of the unknown. If there is anyone out there that knows alot about Military drug screens Im just curious. My recruter said I will be fine Im just making shure and wanting to hear it from other people. Please give me honest answers. THANKS TO WHO EVER ANSWERS THIS.

20090220102138AAQpnQB	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Is this place a potential danger for the clueless?	In the real world, a potential danger is taken seriously, like it or not.      We have seat belt laws for that potential car crash   We have helmet laws for that potential bicycle miss-hap   We pull children from their homes for potential child abuse    I don't know how many laws and mechanical devises have been put in place simply because of that one word, Potential. But there's a lot.      Here though, the word potential has no meaning.   Although the potential of things that could go wrong here outnumber the real world many times over, but with no consequences.      I use the word clueless in a lighthearted way here, as in my lifetime I have came across many people that are extremely intelligent in one respect but clueless (stupid) in another.      A lot of people come here thinking they are going to get the right answer to their question, problem is, they don't know the answer or they wouldn't have asked the question.   So how the hell do they know they have the right answer?   The Answer is simple, They don't   I see people taking an answer as the truth simply because that's the answer they wanted to hear, even though it's way off base and totally wrong.      How many people now live in a fire trap because they choose to believe a wrong answer on an electrical hookup, or something to do with their wood stove,       How many relationships have ended because of a wrong answer.      One way of limiting people getting the wrong answer is by fixing that thumbs down & up feature    I think a lot of people that don't know the answer rely on that, and damn near any question you go to, you can find a number of thumbs down on the right answer and a thumbs up on the wrong answer.   The fix for that would be to have moderators that surf the questions   Flag the users that give an obvious wrong up or down thumb,   Either disable that feature to them or place a rating on their open profile.

20060813234205AAp310h	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why is Answers so uptight all of a sudden?	How idiotic...I read now that the "team" here is going to censor questions before they are even asked! And they want to cut out "non-helpful" answers like "thanks for the two points." Personally, I think the people answering here have done a good job with community censoring. And what's the big deal with a goofy answer? I think the point is to enjoy, learn, and maybe laugh. If the  "team" didn't make getting points so hard, maybe you'd get more serious answers.    Does anyone else think the "team" is going too far? Don't fix it if it ain't broke.

I did successfully ask a question about a week ago and it went fine.  Now I am told my question can't find a home by itself and tells me to pick a category....I already did.  Please someone tell me what to do.  The question is rather important.  I found something about problems with IE 7.0 beta, but I am not using 7.0 beta.  I really need an answer and I need someone to tell me how to get my question posted.

20090220100505AAMKyP8	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Why do some Yahoo! Answers users do this?	Sometimes when I ask a question, someone will answer with a comment that has nothing to do with my question and say something really insulting about my picture or something ... just something immature and irrelevant and I'll call them on it. I go to their profile, and you can email them so I do and I tell them that I don't appreciate their crap and tell them to grow up or whatever 'cause their comments bother me, and I report their crappy answer. Then they go and report my question - which isn't violating anything in any way - they're just ticked off that I reported them, and then my harmless question gets removed, even though there's nothing wrong with it. Why must people be so immature? I'm sure most of them are bratty 14 year old girls, that's my solution ... and why do my questions get removed by Yahoo? Don't they even look at the question before they remove it and realize it was just some brat being immature?

I've been looking for travel insurances online and came across moneysupermarket.com, where I found what I was looking for.       The thing is that a lot of the insurances that come up are quite a bit cheaper on moneysupermarket.com than on the official websites of the insurance companies.      I am not sure what to do. If I take out an insurance over moneysupermarket.com is it still going to be effective? I am just confused because of the price differences. Do they have some sort of deal with insurance companies that would justify the different pricing?      Thank you.

20061105150440AAL4m4O	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Who else is upset about the new Y!A setup?	This question will most likely be removed but as long as one of the Y!A staff team reads it to remove it then I am happy.      Anyway, I am very upset with the new Y!A setup. First of all, I hate it that there isn't a featured question part anymore. I mean, it really showed the important questions and the important questions really need the attention to get more answers.      Most people on Y!A could agree with me that they liked the old setup better. I mean, I love Y!A and appreciate their hard work. I can rely on this site to give me help with what I need rather than any other site.       I have been browsing around and I can see that a lot of other people did actually like the old setup. So it's a fact that it was better than this new one.      Take a time to question your new decisions, Y!A.   Thank you for being there, though.

When I'm IMing with someone, and changing my picture, there's an option at the bottom that says "Use this selection for everyone" with a box you can check. What does that do? I assumed it meant if you didn't check that box, then only the person you're IMing with can see the picture you've selected. Except when I changed pictures, and left that box unchecked, so that only she could see the new pic, other people on my list could see it too. Why is that?

Someone, somehow is breaking into Yahoo Instant Messenger and sending chat lines that appear to originate from the person you're chatting with. They're incuding links to geocities websites. If you click them you are instantly infected with a virus. Is Yahoo doing anything about this? Obviously they are aware of the problem, why won't they do anything about it? From stolen passwords, to erased blogs, to deleted accounts. Yahoo seems more interested in adding features to compete with the likes of myspace and hi5 then they are in protecting their own communtiy of loyal members. Get off your can and do something about this terrible problem Yahoo!!!

I have used this everyday for over 8 months and at 3am, which is normal for me, i went to access my yahoo messenger.  The yahoo messeger box came up as usual where you have to sign in with e mail address and password.  The yellow smiley guy lights up and within 3-4 seconds goes back to grey.  I have tried everything i can think of and nothing is working.  I did talk to Rogers and the tech guy went ahead with my permission and accessed it and it worked fine for him.  I also went to a friends and it worked there also with the exception that they do not have 8.1 but 7.0.  Basically i figure something has been done to computer somewhere that has blocked this but i have no idea what or how.   Any suggestions?
