Per alcune di loro addirittura si trattava del primo figlio! <br>  <br>  Che dire: tanto amore, tanta eccitazione e sicuramente molta più maturità di tante altre neo-mamme.<br>  Ci sono dei rischi e sarebbe sciocco ignorarli ma esistono anche una serie di esami da fare prima e durante la gravidanza che possono dare una certa sicurezza.<br>  Credo che la scelta sia tua, del tuo partner e che il parere del tuo medico sia da tenere in considerazione ( esistono 45enni che sono più sane e in forma di molte 20enni).<br>  Per il discorso del gap generazionale io non mi preoccuperei molto. Un figlio mantiene giovani e attivi più dei debiti!<br>  <br>  Un grosso in bocca al lupo|`|gPsZYd8laa	fallo...e no aspettare....Dio ti darà la forza perchè sei una persona che può dare tanto ai propri figli!|`|iiSOXTeXaa	certo|`|mpK5zrmKaa	anch'io compierò quaranta cinque anni a settembre e ho già due figli maschi e provo questo desiderio di maternità già da tempo ma mi rendo conto che più passano i giorni più è difficile, mi chiedo se sia giusto, ma sono sicura che sarei così pronta ad amarlo, anzi ad amarla, ovviamente vorrei fosse femmina, e a volte mi sento un caso unico, e mi ha fatto piacere  sapere che c'è un' altra donna come me, spero di rileggerti e di confrontarci su questa cosa, ma in breve tempo......comunque anche la ginecologa dice che se non ci sono particolari problemi solo l'amniocentesi è quasi obbligatoria|`|sWp9PBrEaa	perchè non dovresti avere un altro figlio, al giorno d'oggi i controlli che si fanno sono tantissimi anche per noi un po più giovani e non correresti nessun rischio.<br>  se il tuo ciclo è regolare e se sei pronta ad un altro viaggio... anche perchè è una delle poche cose che vale la pena vivere è un emozione immensa e tu lo sai benissimo.<br>  in bocca al lupo!

Si el de verdad t quiere debe darte la oportunidad de experimentar mas cosas en tu vida,por q si no es capaz de entenderlo entonces es un egoista.No t apresures,siempre hay algo nuevo para llenar la vida.Suerte.

Dios extiende su mano en medio de nuestras tormentas, depende de nosotros tomarnos de ella y ser levantados por arriba de nuestras circunstancias.<br>  <br>  Ya te aprecio sin conocerte, Dios te bendiga .<br>  ilianahb@hotmail.com|`|rsJBjhvzaa	uiii dificil momento que estan pasandoo el ombre no tiene korazon es un taradoo kosii aselee kreer que tu puedes solaa quee no nececiitas de el para estar bn y que sii keeree ke se kede cn eiiaa iwal uno tiene amiwoos y konfiaa en mi pa kualker kosa ke keras te dejo mi msn y todo asii ablamos y nos asemos ma amiwas suerte y asta fuersa que el minoo se de kuenta de ke lo kee se ta perdiendoo <br>  <br>  <br>  chiikoriitah@hotmail.es<br>  <br>  adioz suertee|`|yP1Qehkfaa	nena lo siento mucho, pero ten presente que dentro tuyo esta creciendo un hermoso bebe que va traer luz a tu vida .. pensa en tu bebe!!...|`|72a9af9aafdf843130f819317017cf65aa	mira ahora lo que importa eres TU Y TU HIJO que llevas en tu vientre!!!!!!!!!!!!!!asi que animo y no estes triste ese hijo que tienes dentro tuyo no merece que estes mal sabias que los bebes sienten si sus madres estan tristes!!!!!!!!!!!!DISFRUTA TU EMBARAZO SE FELIZ DA GRACIAS DE ESTAR SANA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!y de que te das cuenta????vas a ser mama!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!solo piensa en eso en ti tu felicidad y la de tu bb/|`|VIIYR7yGaa	Johanna, animo, ya vas a ver como las cosas pronto cambiarán, pensá en ese ser peque?ito que llevas dentro que nacerá dentro de unos meses y hacelo por él, ponete alegre porque ya pronto lo tendrás entre tus brazos y el solito con su carita y su sonrisa te devolverá el animo y las ganas de vivir que tanto te están haciendo falta.|`|K7QVCAImaa	mira ,no sos la unica o tenia un novio de 2 anos y quede embarazada , nos ibamos a casar y el nunca aparecio , yo me quedo sola con mi embarazo pase muy mal , pero cuando nacio mi hijo que ahora tiene 11 anos me cambio la vida sufri mucho mucho .pero lo supere despues que nacio mi hijo te deseo suerte y no vuelvas con el .podes salir adelante sola .a mi el doctor me habia rectedado unas pastillas que las tomaba denoche y en la manana para estar mas tranquila ya que pasaba llorando dia y noche .te deseo suerte .y pensa en el bebe que viene aaaaaaa me habia olvidado el hacia 5 mese que estaba con otra mujer .|`|LDke8t48aa	Aguanta ?,aguanta estos meses que te faltan ,.sin dudas vas a sufrir ? pero pasara ? ,cuando tu bb nasca no vas a tener tiempo para otra cosa que no sea el ,y es verdad ,no exageracion ,y eso juega a tu favor ??????aprobechalo ???????vas a estar tan ocupada que ni tendras tiempo de pensar en ese idiota  solo en tu bebe ,vas a resar para poder ir a cagar tranquila (y perdona la sinceridad ,pero asi es )y te vas a dar cuenta que el se lo pierde ,piensa solo en ti y tu bb???

58B3VM8Vaa	Primero: Los sintomas de embarazo no inician tan pronto , esto sucede alrededor del mes y 1 o 2  de embarazo, en ocasiones la mujer no sabe que esta embarazada hasta que nota que el atrazo es demasiado.<br>  <br>  Lo que usualmente ocurre es que al tener relaciones sexuales sin proteccion se esta mas pendiente de los atrazos y se esta a la especttiva de si quedo o no en estado, es entonces que los sintomas subjetivos se presentan, pero si la mujer se tranquiliza y se asegura de su estado primero estos sintomas desaparecen.<br>  <br>  Su menstruacion es muy largo ese mes, si su ciclo es regular es decir que se presenta cada 24,25,26,27,28,29, 30,31, dias, es posible que usted tenga un periodo fertil entre el dia 13-16 contando como dia uno el primer dia de la menstruacion.<br>  <br>  Segun los datos que usted brinda y suponiendo que su ciclo menstrual es regular:Tomando en consideracion que los espermatozoides viven 72horas osea 3 dias, su periodo fertil es 15-18feb, pero en consideracion que usted mantuvo relaciones sexuales sin proteccion el 13feb, usted  pudo quedar embarazada 15feb, sino fue ese dia la probabilidad de embarazo estuvo entre el 16-18feb, ya que mantuvo relaciones sexuales seguidas el 16 y 17feb.<br>  <br>  Si usted no tiene un ciclo menstrual regular lo anterior no vale.<br>  <br>  Lo que le recomiendo es realizarse un examen de laboratorio que se llama sub-beta, que es altamente efectivo.|`|AjY9BPuoaa	haste una prueba casera, asi saldras de duda, ayuda tambien un trago de tequila en ayunas y puede que te baje.suerte|`|MKmBNgjBaa	probablemente si lo estes xq estabas en tus dias fertiles....

C'est sur que ce n'est pas très poli mais moi, mon fils avait 2 ans et n'avait pas voulu faire de bisou à son arrière grand mère parce que : "?a pique ..." !<br>  |`|K8boTfygaa	Franchement c' est honteux de la part de cette veille dame !<br>  L' affection d' un enfant ne s' achète pas.<br>  Mon fils de 4 ans a eu, il n' y a pas longtemps cette période où il ne voulait dire bonjour ni au revoir à personne par simple esprit de contradiction.<br>  Il faut être patient avec les enfants et leur expliquer que, dans la vie, il y a des obligations, y compris être poli, donc dire bonjour et au revoir, même à des personnes que l' on voit peu et qui nous sont antipathiques, selon la hiérarchie et le respect.<br>  <br>  Il ne faut pas les obligés pour autant à leur faire faire de gros bisous à ce genre de personnes. Les enfants sont avant tout des êtres humains qu' il faut respecter eux aussi, ainsi que leur pudeur.Ils réservent leurs bisous et démonstrations de joie aux personnes qu' ils apprécient et c' est normal. Demander à cette dame d'embrasser un jeune banlieusard chef d' entreprise par politesse, on verra sa réaction, elle préférera surement lui serrer la main et encore ... les veilles dames ont peur des jeunes inconnus alors pourquoi ta grand-mère n' accepte t-elle pas que de jeunes enfants aient peur d' elle. Un simple bonjour oral de politesse suffit dans ces cas là.<br>  <br>  Ton fils n'a que 5 ans, d' après ce que tu en dit il est bien élevé.<br>  <br>  J' aimerais savoir si les personnes qui ont dit le contraire ont des enfants car c' est facile de critiquer quand on a pas l' expérience de la vie.

Tu sais une bonne le?on "tu ne me dis pas bonjour alors moi non plus et je ne te regarde pas, je t'ignore, ta petite cousine me dit bonjour, je parle avec elle et lui donne un cadeau" quitte à s'il ne comprend pas laisser le cadeau mais sans lui donner elle même.<br>  <br>  Mais c'est vrai que le coup du cadeau contre le bonjour, ?a fait chantage. <br>  <br>  |`|ryXQ3Luuaa	ma fille était très méfiante avec les personnes qu'elle connaissait pas .. et je n'ai jamais forcé pour le bisou. <br>  je souhaitais au moins un bonjour du bout des lèvres ou un petit signe de la main .. mais le bisou certainement pas .. <br>  <br>  pourquoi un enfant devrait il faire un bisou à tout le monde ?? <br>  <br>  elle a 18 ans maintenant, et est toujours aussi distante .. elle dit bonjour, mais le bisou c'est pas pour tout le monde .. <br>  et je respecte ?a, <br>  <br>  la prochaine fois .. la grand mère, n'aura pas plus de bisou .. hihihi .. <br>  le tout est d'expliquer à ton fils qu'il est important de dire bonjour, mais qu'il n'est pas obligé de faire un bisou. <br>  et ceux qui comprennent pas, tu leur dis qu'il a besoin de temps pour faire connaissance avec les personnes qu'il ne connait pas .. <br>  soit la vieille dame comprend sinon c'est pas grave .. <br>  |`|dc0707fd3130dad8cfd14297d1663e44aa	Les enfants sont parfois imprévisibles et difficile de savoir ce qu'ils ont en tête. Il n'a pas dit bonjour, OK c'est pas génial mais cela ne signifie pas pour autant qu'il soit mal élevé!!!<br>  Elle aurait pu lui faire la remarque, le disputer mais de là à pas lui donner son cadeau, je trouve que c'est une réaction cruelle envers un enfant!<br>  Je suis pourtant du genre sévère et à cheval sur l'éducation mais là faut pas pousser... |`|b2328b56b35b6fc7f6b91616282a1554aa	je trouve ?a bé^bête de la part de l'arrière grandmère.<br>  Bon, je l'excuse car ce doit être une personne agée.<br>  Et c'est vrai que ton fils doit dire bonjour mais parfois, même les enfans les mieux élevés ont des lubbies dans ce genre.<br>  Moi, j'avais une tante qui habitait au canada, que je voyais rarement et bien, petite, je ne prétendais pas lui parler!<br>  Et ma fille, qui a 2 ans et demi, l'autre jour , n'a pas prétendu dire bonjour à son arrière grand père!<br>  Parfois, il leur passe des trucs bizarre dans la tête, mais le priver du cadeau n'est pas une solution!|`|1q2vz4vEaa	Les arrières grand-mères ont été élevées dans un monde ou la politesse était de rigueur.

C'est difficile dans ce cas de comprendre pourquoi un enfant ne veut pas dire bonjour. <br>  C'est à toi à faire comprendre à ton fils que certaines personnes attachent beaucoup d'importance au bisou d'accueil. Il le fera sans doute sans beaucoup d'amour mais au moins, tout le monde sera content. Et puis, est-ce vraiment un gros effort de donner un bisou, surtout si l'on sait qu'il y a un petit cadeau à la clé ? hé hé ! |`|90cec9339b2c7808629b41dc15916eb1aa	Peut être que si tu avais appris a dire bonjour et au revoir à ton fils , ce serait devenu, a 5a, un automatisme ...<br>  Elle a eu raison de ne pas lui donner le cadeau, <br>  peut être qu'il ne lui courra pas dans les bras la prochaine fois mais a mon avis, il ne devait pas trop le faire déjà avant sinon il lui aurait dit bonjour,<br>  Il faut aussi voir les circonstances que l'on ne conna?t pas . Est ce parce que Monsieur boudait ? Est ce une habitude de ne pas dire bjr ?|`|uNar9bs8aa	Qu'est ce qu'on doit punir? La réaction du petit, qui est jeune et impressionable ou la réaction de la grand mère qui est censée être une adulte et savoir que les enfants sont impressionnable!

Si l'enseignant de ton enfant l'oblige à dire bonjour, que vas-tu faire ??? écrire à l'inspection académique ???|`|64a9196b651e584bb14079942e61227caa	IL a du sentir son hostilité ton fils... SI elle lui avéit donné le cadeau comme à l'autre petite il se serait vite déridé et lui aurait fait plein de bisous et ne l'aurait plus lachée mais là il a senti que ce n'était pas un don : les enfants doivent en effet dire bonjour et au revoir mais c'est un apprentissage et qui dit que ton fils n'a pas été intimidé au début ce qui expliquerait son refus et comme ?a s'est envenimé il était encore plus intimidé... Et puis dire bonjour c'était quoi le dire ou faire un bisous ??? Si on a voulu le forcer à faire un bisous je comprends tout à fait : j'avais horreur de ?a moi aussi et les personnes agées avaient du mal à comprendre mais ma mère m'avait appris à tendre la main et sit?t qu'un moment était passé j'acceptais d'aller vers les inconnus : j'étais très angoissées par les inconnus cela ne signifiait pas que j'étais impolie...

0297d1defcfac75fff4abb26ddf7612eaa	Personnellement, je trouve que l'idéal serait un prénom plus ou moins similaire dans les deux pays. Par exemple : Alice / Arisu, Emilie / Emiri... Je ne sais malheureusement pas s'il existe de telles équivalences pour un prénom masculin... <br>  <br>  Mis à part ces équivalences, il faut choisir l'origine du prénom, fran?aise ou japonaise... C'est bien s?r une question de sensibilité personnelle mais je pense que les enfants nés de couples mixtes, étant très souvent fiers de leurs racines, sont heureux de porter un prénom marquant cette origine. <br>  <br>  En tous cas, il me semble important de sélectionner un prénom facile à prononcer dans les deux langues (éviter le "r", par exemple), dont l'orthographe ne prête à confusion (ce doit être assez aga?ant d'avoir souvent à préciser la prononciation de son nom), et dépourvu d'ambigu?té (par exemple, le nom "Rémi" sera plut?t per?u comme féminin par les Japonais).|`|a3c2cf00ffff22abfe7d35cbd88754fdaa	un enfant  c'est pas un chien il n'y a pas de critères faite celons votre coeur et éviter les mode (qui passe) et les prénoms ridicule ex apollon ?a existe j'en connais un.|`|088b49461f9b0bfa19bbc307778baf34aa	Suzie wan<br>  <br>  <br>  Le PUNK!!!|`|348ddf08fb60c75f82203971843f65e4aa	Pour une fille, j'aime bien Kanaé et pour un gar?on Miki (je sais, je me suis pas beaucoup foulée, les prénoms sont japonais).|`|67d8310edffef5f51a2450e61dd43fc4aa	Sanguku ?|`|8d23f4f38ae34655978e90eb3d8d3716aa	wo aii ni ? donc woaiini si tu as le droit...|`|ef5756e3f75bddce7d61fd286feb4953aa	michiko ce serait le plus simple pour une fille mais pour un gar?on un prénom européen serait plus simple !|`|4461ed21df7e31de54fdd0308bb4b270aa	félicitations je suis sur que ca fera un tres bo bb <br>  pour le prenon g pas d'idées|`|82f17d307048de55651c6d529798c968aa	Hitomi<br>  de "vision of escaflowne"|`|9235dce840e5927a680e77dae0785d2aaa	Fille ou gar?on?<br>  <br>  Fille: Erina, Aiko (+japonais je sais)<br>  <br>  gar?on: ... sais pas.. mais c'est vrai que "Sacha" est un joli prénom et en plus il est mixte je crois.|`|9cee0a95050d4c127c97ab7e33f252b0aa	Georges ou Gertrude|`|c71972f54dfb6c96fcc13b2d3736e54caa	Franpon =)|`|d8360d9aa2499e37e440fa4fbccf0519aa	sacha c'est pas mal sushi c'est mieux|`|e3404e4b6b76ec136721f4d133f14e24aa	ara kirri|`|f6aec2c4bd5c435be72f96d1d9827713aa	NIPPON NI Mauvais !|`|06bbbd67b40d20c21e4a5f0e9cca40e3aa	félicitation  moi je propose chayan ou kenzy c beau comme prénom a toi de voir encore félicitation a vous deux|`|085f01a6bce9ef374c3c2de043b5cb07aa	Enri ou Hugo<br>  C'est ok pour la prononciation en fran?ais et en japonnais|`|2a477d5ef82e7c48162f03157b76a94faa	kimino,shiio,situsha,kélia,éllia, plus européen, elysabeth,victoria,nina,chléo....<br>  <br>  FéLICITATION !!!!|`|6d0839734f6f9e47795313508ed66bb6aa	bonjour,moi j'aime bien le prenom jade,leeane,john,elijha toutes mes felicitations vous accompagne.|`|95ce9fbd77c25a135271c6d030297f1daa	Celui qui refletera l'amour de ses parents ;)|`|a4f21d6f4a7e1483e13d6744823b0fffaa	yang pierre|`|cc7188cecc84211d59fea8f6af8c0f55aa	nippon ni passerelles <br>  <br>  <br>  jean lign zung richard mouhahahahahah|`|de41fa3b1551c8b77ee6c1f03126af2faa	Je connais un couple dont la maman est Japonaise justement, ils ont eu une fille et l'on appelé A?ka (signifie "fleur de l'amour")...|`|eba61476f94a4b6fae1dba229b33c5f8aa	Pour un petit gar?on je dirais Kenjy, ?a fait un peu manga mais bon Et pour une petite fille Ming, c'est plus chinois que japonais mais ?a sonne asiatique.

g4x5v28oaa	C'est moi qui ai réclamé la césarienne et ce, dés le 1er mois de grossesse ! Pour ma première fille, l'accouchement par voie naturelle a été une véritable boucherie à cause d'un obstétricien incompétent ! Alors pour la seconde, j'ai demandé à mon gynéco-obstétricien (pas le même) de me faire la césarienne. Quant il a vu les papiers des soins intensifs pour ma première fille, quand il a été au courant du carnage, il n'a pas hésité une seconde. Je n'ai pas eu peur de la césarienne qui a été très bien faite ! C'est douloureux durant quelques jours mais tu peux te lever dés le lendemain !

J'ai été suivi par une psy tellement que je l'ai mal vécu.

J'avais une grande confiance en l'équipe médicale (à raison) et tout s'est très bien passé. J'avais fait des cours de prépa avec une sage-femme super sympa qui nous avait bien expliqué comment ?a se passait: donc, je connaissais le déroulement.|`|NAMjLgWAaa	je sui a 22SA et bebe est en siege (aux 2echos), et bien sur tt le monde va dire ke dici a ce ke jacouche il peut se retourner mai forcemen (en + 1ere grossesse...) je pense a la cesarienne (parcke or de kestion ke jacouche pa voie basse je ne le souhaite pas si bb est tjs en siege, et je ne sohaite pas non plus ke kkun (gygy, osteo...) esai de retourner bébé...c un choix...) parcke on c jamai sa peu nou ariver, et cest vrai ke sa me fai peur... jai peur d complication, jai peur du pire (et oui jy ai penser pa tro joyeu kom sujet ms bn...) oui moi sa me fai peur... ... ...bon courage!!|`|hj7FL9JTaa	Césarienne non prévue pour ma fille née il y a deux ans et demi. Sur le moment, ?a a été un choc car je voulais accoucher par voie basse mais ma fille se présentait mal. Pas eu le choix.<br>  <br>  Pour mon deuxième bébé (en route), je demanderai une césarienne, pour raison médicale trop longue à expliquer et hors sujet.<br>  <br>  Donc tu vois, pas de quoi avoir peur! Si je la demande alors que je pourrais accoucher par voie basse, tu peux bien imaginer que ce n'est pas si terrible!<br>  <br>  No stress, tu oublieras vite! En 24h tu seras debout et en 48h tu marcheras ;-)|`|JzcktjEWaa	g été sécarisée deux fois et je la préfére plus au travail .<br>  c normal qu'on ai  un peu peur mais ya que la piquure de l'anesthésiste qui fait mal sinon rien

Mais ne panique pas, surtout garde ton calme! Arrête maintenant toute je dis bien toute activité physique.

xSzbzWhWaa	La clarté nuquale doit etre inférieure a 3 mm et ca se mesure entre 10 et 12 semaine d'aménhorrée.

Par contre, quelques fois, l'echo ne peut pas prendre une mesure de bonne qualité.<br>  <br>  Par contre, à trois mois de grossesse, la gyneco te proposera de faire le tri test (prise de sang pour déceler le RISQUE de trisomie 21). Attention, ce test n'est pas fiable. il ne montre qu'un risque potentiel et sa fiabilité reste tellement a desirer qu'on l'a supprimer en allemagne.

Son médecin lui a dit qu'arrêter la cigarette brusquement pouvait créer une sensation de manque et de stress aussi dommageable pour l'enfant que la cigarette elle même.

Et si ton bébé subit toutes tes cigarettes qui te dit que tu n'angoissera pas sur la mort subite du nourrisson, tu pourrait te rendre malade juste par cette idée et je peut te dire que beaucoup moins si tu arrette. <br>  Pour le stress, la sophrologie c'est génial.|`|ryXQ3Luuaa	je fumais également un paquet par jour voire un paquet et demi avant ma grossesse. <br>  <br>  ce problème a été abordé avec ma gynéco, qui m'a bien dit que ce n'etait pas bon pour le bb, mais qu'arrêter de fumer du jour au lendemain, pouvait etre plus dommageable pour l'enfant vu l'état de stress que cela pouvait avoir sur moi .. <br>  <br>  donc elle m'a demandé de repérer les cigarettes qui étaient vraiment incontournables pour moi .. et m'a demandé de ne pas dépasser les 5 par jour .. <br>  le papa fumait aussi .. et on ne fumait plus dans la maison ni pendant ma grossesse, ni après .; ce qui permet aussi de limiter le nombre de clopes, <br>  donc toutes les cigarettes du matin avec le café, terminé .. et ce jusqu'à pres le repas ou j'en fumais une, avec mon café .. <br>  voire deux ... la seconde ou troisième dans l'apres midi .. une le soir apres le repas .. et souvent une avant de me coucher .. et je buvais beaucoup d'eau .. tisanes .. <br>  j'ai largement diminué le café et le thé, car clopes et café ?a va bien ensemble aussi .. <br>  <br>  et j'ai bu un peu de vin aussi, pas souvent, et pas beaucoup , mais je me faisais plaisir aussi ..

Le BB ne souffre absolument pas d'un syndrome de manque si la maman s'arrête de fumer pendant sa grossesse, même si elle fumait beaucoup. Le stress qu'elle peut ressentir n'est pas ressenti par le BB, n'en déplaise aux ames sensibles. Au contraire, le BB est mieux oxygéné dès le premier jour d'arrêt!! Alors mesdames, je sais qu'il est extrêmement difficile d'arrêter, et encore plus de continuer quand on est enceinte, avec le regard des autres et la culpabilité, on le voit bien avec ces imbéciles qui vous disent "pense à ton BB et tu y arriveras". Qu'ils essaient de dire ?a à une toxico! Le tabac EST une véritable addiction qui doit etre TRAITEE. N'hésitez pas à consulter des tabacologues qui pourront vous aider, et ne vous voilez pas le face en vous disant que le médecin a dit que c'était préférable de continuer que d'arrêter brutalement, c'est juste qu'il n'a pas envie de gérer votre stress à la prochaine consultation. Consultez! Il existe des sages-femmes tabacologues qui peuvent vous aider.<br>  PS les patchs sont autorisés pendant la grossesse, ne faites pas les frileuses, dans la clope il y a 4000 substances toxiques, dans le patch il n'y a que de la nicotine, qui n'entraine pas de malformations et qui n'est pas la substance responsable du manque d'oxygène du BB (?a c'est le monoxyde de carbone)<br>  Courage!|`|CAPSfAhMaa	Bonsoir , oui même si j'ai du mal à l'avouer : je fumais avant et après la grossesse 30 cigarettes/jour et pendant de 5 à 7.

SYBfPFcDaa	Doctors all differ with their advice on this topic, some say to feed on demand, other say to structure it, so really their advice holds no meaning as there is probably a just-as-good doctor saying the opposite down the road. It's a matter of opinion, and it's wrong that doctors inflict their own beliefs on parents on subjects like this. It's not a medical issue, he should be advising of the pro's and con's of both options, not laying down the law, but sadly it's rare that a doctor actually does this. My personal strong opinion is that, unless you have twins where a structured day is a necessity to prevent yourself feeding around the clock, that you should demand feed. This is what I did, I could never see my son cry with hunger I think it is cruel. When they get older it is easier to structure their diets, I know when my son wants to eat now and so I offer him the food before he begins crying for it, but on the occasions my son (10 months) cries for it earlier I let him have it earlier. But at this age, I certainly believe demand feeding is the way to do it, unless there are any serious weight issues that you haven't mentioned. But that's just my opinion, it's something I feel strongly on so I am struggling offering you an unbiased point of view, but honestly it is your baby and your choice and you do what YOU think is best, not your doctor, not me, not anybody else. Maternal instinct beats nothing else.<br>  <br>  Edit: ARGH why do non parents think they are qualified to offer parenting advice?! Looking at katiebels Q&A's, and judging from her naive answer, she is almost certainly not a parent. Once again I'm saying to trust your own instincts, whatever they are, but I just wanted to say that feeding your son every 2 hours now will NOT mean you will be doing so forever. Please don't listen to crap advice like that! As I said I fed my son when he wanted, sometimes he'd be eating every hour as a newborn! Now, he has 2 bottles first thing, a meal at 12ish, a meal at 4ish, a meal at 7ish, and then a bottle before bed. Is that every two hours katiebel?? No! Stop giving advice on subjects you clearly know sod all about!!! Sorry for the rant lol *breathes deeply*!|`|5jsOoWCLaa	I think this is a personal thing. I fed my son on demand. I think that is what worked best for us.|`|Yx3ZRvuKaa	If your baby wants to eat every two hours than that is ok.  I work at the children's hospital ICU and we allow our newborns to eat every 2 to 4 hours.  You do not want to feed any more often than every 2 because she may start snacking, this is where the baby starts to eat so often that she will only want to eat an oz or so every hour or less, this is not fun!  If she is hungry and is continuing to eat at least 4oz at every feed then allow her to eat on her demand, just watch for snacking habits :)  Good luck|`|qxy9xCAsaa	The doctor is giving you his/her textbook advice - not advice specific to your baby.  If she was a normal size, full term baby, she should probably now be able to go for 3-4 hours like the doc says, but...  <br>  <br>  My first question would be is she really hungry?  Or does she just have a strong need to suck?  Maybe a pacifier would be good for her.  Or maybe she would benefit from sucking her fingers or thumb.  You don't have her hands covered with those little scratch-resistant mittens, right?  <br>  <br>   And my second question is how much is she eating at a feeding.  If she's only having 2 oz, then of course she's hungry before 3-4 hours go by.  Work on filling her tummy at each feeding - probably about 4 oz or even a little more.  Then she probably won't be hungry before 3-4 hours.  And even if she is still hungry, feed her.  Maybe she's just going through a growth spurt and needs the extra food.<br>  <br>  Yes, Dr's know a lot, but Mom's have an instinct as to what is right for their baby...  Best wishes to you :o)|`|50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	Well my ped told me that too. Basically she wants us to feed him on a structured schedule during the day and then on demand at night. She says when he is over 10 pounds, he can feed every 4 hours but 3 before then. We can delay him by playing, having a bath, changing a diaper etc. But if the baby is starving and screaming, go ahead and feed. If her set schedule is every two hours then thats her schedule. If you can delay her 20 minutes today and then 30 minutes tomorrow, eventually she will eat more at each feeding and it will naturally space out longer. Ive done this with my son because he tends to snack but I never just let him cry it out. Can you imagine being helpless and  telling someone "Im so hungry! Please feed me!" and they just ignore you for two hours? That would be traumatic.<br>  <br>  So kinda listen to the doctor, delay her a little but not for hours and hours and definitely not to cry. My son eats more often when he is having a growth spurt because he needs it. I would never deny him food. I want to establish good communication channels and trust with him now so I wouldnt ignore him when he is trying to tell me something. Some doctors forget that its a child, not something in a textbook. <br>  <br>  Good luck hon. trust your judgment and you will do whats right.<br>  <br>  EDIT: 4-6 oz every 2 hours? That is a healthy appetite! I thought she was like my son who snacks on an oz or two at a time that often. She is a growing girl! Let her eat that much. She must need it.|`|AA10946089	Please do not let your baby cry - feed her ON DEMAND, when she is hungry!! When my baby was your age, I tried to put her on a feeding "schedule". Do you get hungry at the same time everyday?  Honestly - feed her when she is hungry - my baby girl is 6 months old now and STILL eats every 3 hours - no more, no less, so if your baby is hungry every 2 hours, then feed her! That will slowly increase to every 3-4 hours soon, but definitely feed her when she is hungry.|`|zTcHSR7baa	Don't listen to your doctor I think you need to look for a new one he is old school. You need to breast feed your baby when she is hungry not by the clock. This will build up a good milk supply and your baby will be happy and grow big and strong.<br>  Some Doctor don't know much about breast feeding (like my doctor) so you need to get the right info from somewhere else. I use the breast feeding association to help me.|`|U0r2xyGKaa	Feed her when she is hungry!  She is still new and you do not need to put her on a schedule.  As she gets older she will be eating more and will end up not being hungry as often.  She is a growing girl and needs to eat to stay healthy.  Just make sure that you have exhausted all other options..dirty diaper, too cold/warm, wants to be held, doesn't want to be held..has a tummy ache...if it isn't any of those things, she is hungry, feed her.|`|Ujxrpoonaa	Sounds like my little guy. He was a big baby at birth (10lbs 6oz) and since about 1-2 weeks old he was normally eating about 4oz and slowly needed more than that. By 4 weeks he was gulping down 6oz no problem. He is now 6 weeks and is growing great and still eats 6oz, sometimes even 7oz at night!! The doctor told me the same thing but I didnt listen. Go with your instinct... your doctor may be an expert on babies, but you are an expert on your baby. |`|59fcd325f0dcf47b63e3ed62aeaf2be1aa	Wow!!!! My baby ate and is still eating (9 weeks now) every 2 hours. His doctor said not to deny him food. So you should feed her. Do what you think is best if she is hungry don't make her go without food. I am surprised that you were told that. <br>  Good luck with everything. Everyone tells me to follow what you think because you are the mother and you know whats best for your baby. |`|NkOHmPpmaa	Babies are meant to be fed on demand...not by some schedule the doctor has made up for them.<br>  <br>  I can't believe the amount o people who have said they feed their babies on a schedule...i bet they don't wait till it's an exact time to eat if they are hungry.<br>  <br>  I have always fed my babies on demand and they are both a very healthy weight...not overweight at all.|`|cO4KDRjIaa	wow i'm pretty sure when my girls were only 4 weeks old they ate every 2 hours. if u try to sooth ur crying baby with no luck & ur sure it's hungry, u know best, feed ur baby. a mother knows her babies cry. every baby is different. try upping the amount by a half ounce or so & see if she'll go longer in between feedings. i started adding rice cereal to my babies bottles at 8 weeks, just a little to thicken it up. every dr will tell u something different, but it sounds like ur in tune with what ur baby needs.|`|JrqW7HPjaa	well, you're supposed to feed on demand... so u r giving formula? if the doc thinks its too much, then give her a pacifier.. I think you should go with your instinct. My daughter is breastfed n fed for every hour for the first month or so... now at 2 months.. she feeds every 2 hours and sleeps through the night but its different cause bf babies do eat a lot more... while im at work.. i tell my sister not to give her 5 ounces in one sitting|`|vnsHdVlLaa	Feed her when she's hungry.  The doctor is just giving you a general idea.  Even if a baby is only 4 weeks old, they know when they are hungry and when they are full.|`|7oUlSm8Haa	I'd feed her when she cries----BUT not every time.

At her one week check-up he asked how she is eating and I told him she eats about 2-3 oz every 2-3 hours (what the hospital discharge papers advised me to do) and he said that is good. Sometimes now (at 4 weeks) she eats 4 oz and then 2 oz and then 3 oz...it depends on how hungry she is and if she has a tummy ache she wants to eat more thinking it will go away, when it actually just makes it worse usually. <br>  <br>  I've seen a few different posts on here saying they're baby's doctor said ONLY feed them this amount this many times and let them cry otherwise...I've personally never heard that from any doctor with either of my 2 children. As long as they burp and don't eat so much they get a tummy ache then I'd say feed her when she's hungry. We don't starve ourselves just because we only ate 2 hours ago...why would we starve a baby?<br>  <br>  Unless your doctor has a good reason (and I would ask, personally) why to only feed her as he/she said I would feed her when she wants to be fed.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	For the ppl on here that said listen to the doctor and not the rest of the MOTHERS must not have children.<br>  <br>  I made the mistake of listening to the docs and feeding Sarah at first every 3-4 hrs...she lost weight and had a hard time gaining it back. Feed your baby when she is hungry. If she wants 5 oz so be it if she wants less that is ok...they let you know when they are hungry and when they are full. Dont be afraid of giving her too much especially at this age. They need all the nutrients they can get. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|AA10186411	Feed that youngin when she's hungry!  If it were up to Pediatricians, our kids would starve lol |`|ao4r5aPuaa	how much is she eating every 2 hours?|`|hrMhhB4Saa	at that age, you feed on demnad!|`|FpT7x2VVaa	first - get a second medical opinion!<br>  <br>  meantime, as others have said "trust your instinct". if you think every two hours is too much, stretch it a bit, but not too long. it's important to establish a regular routine and not every crying is due to hunger. sometimes they just need to get comfortable and snuggle on you.<br>  <br>  watch that the weight gain is regular and steady - this will tell you if she gets enough.<br>  I certainly would not her her cry for an hour or more, just to stick to the doctor's "timetable".|`|PLK1p8cUaa	Feed her on demand.  Babies are programmed to eat small frequent meal but since she is already use to eating 4 oz. she is not going to change.  We recommend to parents that they breast feed on demand with no set schedule.  With formula we tell them to feed in the beginning every 2-3 hours as much as the baby wants.  As they grow they will adjust the amount and frequency of the feedings.  They only take what they need and their stomachs can hold.  If she were getting too much she would have vomiting and loose stools.  If you don't agree with your pediatricians recommendations then find another doctor.  Good luck.|`|4TNavgDuaa	Well i'm breastfeeding and I feed her about everything 2 hours, shes almost 2 months but when my daughter was 4 weeks she was on this everything hour kick. Doctor said she would but that was for breastfeeding.|`|OHq5gSjJaa	Every two hours is totally normal!!  I'm sorry but that doctor sounds crazy!  Feeding on demand is considered the most appropriate way to go when babies are still this young.|`|ggo0etbEaa	never let the baby just cry when they're that young. they're crying for a reason. feed the poor baby if she's hungry.|`|d3738eb514750f43107214065eba5810aa	Newborns need to eat and sleep on demand, not on a set schedule  :)
0kQMLNUMaa	as tu observé un bébé à la maternité?<br>  crois tu qu'il soit capable d'attrapper le drap et la couverture et de s'enfouir le nez dedans??<br>  <br>  je leur ai posé la question aux sage-femmes lors de mon accouchement. et c'est vrai qu'elle ne bougeait pas du tout ma puce avec ses deux points en l'air.<br>  <br>  c'est donc: injustifié (à la mat)<br>                   trop onéreux d'investir dans des gigoteuse<br>                   pas évident à stériliser, pas comme des draps tout neutre et sans fermuture éclair.<br>  <br>  par contre de retour à la maison, il est préférable de s'habituer de suite à la gigoteuse, parce qu'on ne sait pas trop à partir de quand le bébé peut se mettre sous un drap.<br>  <br>  et puis au moins ils sont au chaud toute la nuit, et plus tard il n'y apas de crise car l'enfant se perd au fond du lit sous sa couverture (lol)|`|qUabsTzCaa	Je pense que c'est à cause du lit et de sa très petite taille. Si tu mets la couverture sous les bras, il risque de s'étouffer, en gros, que s'il passe dessous. Mais le lit est petit, ses pieds buttent, il n'a pas la place de se glisser sous la couverture. Alors que les lits pour bébé sont beaucoup plus longs et larges. On conseille d'ailleurs aux mamans qui veullent mettre des couvertures à leur bébé de positionner ses pieds contre le pied du lit. En gros, le mettre en bas du lit et non en haut, et de bien caler la couverture sous le matelas (et de mettre la couveryure au niveau des aisselles, pas plus haut, et faire passer les bras au dessus de la couverture). Comme ?a il ne pourra pas glisser dessous.<br>  <br>  <br>  J'ai une copine qui a accouché il y a un moi,s sa princesse avait aussi draps+ couverture.|`|be94fa379716df74d4695a2e0717cc04aa	gigoteuse|`|07ec08013bacb6bf75c238af2ca27e5caa	on a eut la même réflexion avec ma voisine de chambre à la mater....nos petits avaient des petits duvets! Alors que dans tous les manuels et partout tu liras qu'il ne faut pas mettre de couverture à un bébé....<br>  Mon fils a jamais eut de gigoteuse...mais une tite couverture en coton crocheté et n'a jamais eut de soucis....et n'a jamais chopé froid|`|189c69d68d7159d8d0bf0cf20004f676aa	c'est quoi que tu appelles la mat? La maternité, ou la maternelle? Moi, j'ai toujours entendu dire que si on met des turbulettes aux nouveaux-nés et pas des couvertures, c'est simplement pour qu'ils ne risquent pas de s'étouffer avec en dormant.<br>  ...<br>  A la maternité, on avait des gigoteuses. Tu as raison, c'est bizarre.|`|24de487071205d0e2e48372cba1c686baa	A la mater mes loulous avaient la turbulette... et encore que la nuit car ils faisaient beaucoup trop chaud.<br>  Et à la maison, ils ont eu la turbulette tant qu'ils étaient dans le lit à barreaux. Quand ils sont passés au lit classique d'enfants, ils ont eu oreiller + couette.|`|1be66df60aabde783169d3ea412c4e23aa	je pense qu un bebe a le droit de gigoter donc contre|`|42612f62763f45f17a006451edbb230daa	Bonsoir,<br>  <br>  Je vous conseille la turbulette pour chez vous, car elle permet à votre enfant de dormir sans entrave, donc plus sereinement et en sécurité, de plus, il ne risque pas de s'etouffer s'il dort sur le dos bien-sur.<br>  <br>  Quant à la contradition qui semble vous contrarier à propos de la couverture en maternité :<br>  Vous avez pu remarquer que votre enfant passe 8/9 mois dans votre ventre, il est confiné et au chaud, le fait de mettre un nouveau-né dans un berceau haut et transparent qui vous permet de voir ce qui s'y passe, et ainsi, il peut être bordé dans une couverture afin de retrouver la sérénité de son environnement passé, ce qui le rassure.<br>  <br>  Au bout de quelques jours, il peut faire sa transition entre le ventre maternel et l'air extérieur, c'est pour cela que vous pouvez le libérer de cette couverture.<br>  <br>  Voilà, j'espère avoir répondu à vos attentes<br>  <br>  Bonne soirée|`|Lv6QWH5Xaa	je pense que c'est aussi du à l'endroit dans lequel ils dorment. les berceaux à la mat sont très petits, la couverture ne peut quasiment pas bouger, alors que dans un lit à barreaux avec un nouveau-né, il y a plus de risque que la couverture bouge et vienne sur son nez.<br>  enfin, ce n'est qu'une idée personnelle car je n'ai aucune explication des personnes concernées.  <br>  <br>  personnellement, quand ma fille est née, à la mat elle avait une couverture et tant qu'elle a dormi dans la nacelle aussi (la gigoteuse ne rentrait pas). par contre dès qu'elle est passée dans son lit, on lui a mis une gigoteuse jusqu'à ses 9 mois environ comme elle cherchait à se lever on est repassé à la couverture pour éviter qu'elle ne se prenne les pieds dedans et ne se cogne contre les barreaux.|`|zBXmRdxlaa	C'est vrai que c'est contradictoire, mes enfants à la mat. on eu drap et couverture sauf pour de dernier car il est né en Juin l'année de la canicule, il dormait en couche tellement il faisait chaud.<br>  Autrement à la maison ?a été pyjama et turbulette pour l'hiver et les jours d'été tout dépendait du temps, pyjama, body, et j'avais acheté une turbulette spécial été. Ensuite c'est chacun son choix.|`|1VcKGUzdaa	L'avantage de la gigoteuse, c'est que bébé ne se découvre pas et s'il fait froid c'est mieux.<br>  <br>  L'inconvénient de la gigoteuse c'est que bébé ne se découvrant pas non plus s'il a trop chaud ?a le fait pas.<br>  <br>  Drap et couverture, c'est peut-être moins cher à l'achat et à entretenir ?|`|0NvegiCSaa	cela dépends des maternités et des parents, a la maternité c'était couverture et draps mais je ne lui mettais pas, et dans la même maternité quelques mois aprés c'est devenu gigoteuse donc va savoir. je préfère gigoteuse mais mon  fils dort sans rien.|`|64f9264fce2c53ff8080c7545df33a36aa	Discours tenue lors de mon accouchement dans une maternité parisienne :<br>  <br>  Amenez votre turbulette car on n'a que des couvertures ce qui est dangereux car si bébé se la met sur la tête, il ne peut plus respirer.<br>  |`|c4a8b6ffbc947e44c112527be4b84e6eaa	A la maternité sa été gigoteuse et cela jusqu'au 1 an de mon fils|`|NIhBcYW0aa	moi c'est couverture pour ma doudou, parce qu'avec la gigoteuse elle ne peut pas bouger...|`|c20DUZnXaa	la gigoteuse est bcp mieux, avec la couverture y a un risque d'étouffement.je suis infirmière et g travaillé pendant mes études lors des vacances scolaires comme auxiliaire puéricultrice dans une maternité et c'est vrai qu'on leur mets drap et couverture.mais dans notre cas, le lit est tout petit et on passe la couverture sous le matelas, vous voyez ce que je veux dire??le bébé est emmitouflé et il n'y a aucuns risques pour ke la couverture recouvre son visage car elle est calée des 2 cotés sous le matelas.et en + les bb à cet age gigote peu donc pas de risque je pense!|`|EbDw81ZCaa	C'est en effet contradictoire en ce qui concerne le choix des maternités ! Problèmes de finances peut être !<br>  Pour des questions de sécurité, il vaut mieux utiliser la turbulette pour les nourrissons qui ont tendance à enrouler leurs petits doigts dans les draps ou les couvertures et les amener à leur bouche.<br>  Il y a risque d'étouffement.<br>  De plus, avec la turbulette, en hiver, tu es certaine qu'il soit couvert, ton petit bout !<br>  femmeformidable<br>  |`|TynIUum3aa	Va comprendre ! Moi, je dirais que tout dépend des enfants.<br>  <br>  Mon 1er ne supportait pas de draps, mais voulait avoir une petite couverture faite main. Alors, on lui mettait sur les jambes, dans son couffin. Et jamais de souci. Après, la gigoteuse pour l'hiver.<br>  <br>  Le second, lui, ne supporte rien ! Pour l'hiver, c'est galère, il ne supporte pas la gigoteuse ! Alors, on lui a mis une petite couverture polaire mais, vu qu'il n'arrête pas de bouger, il finit par... dormir dessus !<br>  <br>  En général, si un bébé bouge beaucoup, il peut se retrouver avec la couverture sur la tête, et au début, il n'arrive pas à se dégager. D'où un risque d'étouffement. A la maternité, les bébés sont rarement seuls, et ils ne bougent pas encore beaucoup. Les risques me semblent moindres. L'intérêt de la gigoteuse c'est que justement, ils ne peuvent pas l'enlever ni se retrouver dessous ! Enfin, quand ils la veulent bien ;-)<br>  <br>  Donc, si ton p'tit bout ne veut pas de gigoteuse, comme le mien, tu peux toujours prévoir un pyjama un peu plus chaud, avec un body dessous et pour la nuit, ?a devrait passer :-) Et comme ?a, plus d'inquiétudes :-)<br>  <br>  Bonne continuation !|`|kUW8Vcxtaa	bonjour, gigoteuse car la couverture très vite bb bouge et peu la relever la mettre sur lui sans qu'on le voit <br>  en maternité on met drap couverture ils ont maximum 1 semaine,<br>  bouge très peu<br>  mais très vite il va bougé, tout va très vite<br>  donc autant prendre de suite gigoteuse<br>  e ten plus en grandissant<br>  effet contraire en hivers on est sur qu'il ne se déocuvrira pas<br>  voilà<br>  marlène alys<br>  puéricultrice de formation à votre service<br>  |`|NAMjLgWAaa	je comprends ton interogation mais si tu interoge ton gygy, les sage femme etc je suis certaine que tous te diron kil faut couvrir bébé avec une gigoteuse pas doreiller ni de couverture!!! pour eviter tous risque detouffement du nouveau né... c'est une cause de mortalité chez les nouveau né donc moi je te conseille fortement la gigoteuse!!!!|`|e6zZEQq0aa	A la maternité, on m'avait demandé d'apporter une gigoteuse. Il n'y avait ni drap ni couverture dans le berceau, juste le drap house. Donc pas de contradction dans mon cas entre le discours des professionnels de la petite enfance et la réalité des choses. |`|uLktVOWJaa	C'est s?rement contradictoire. Il appartient à la maman d'apporter la turbulette et de ne pas utiliser la couverture de la maternité, c'est tout. Une maternité c'est comme un h?pital, ils utilisent des choses standard, la turbulette est intime et personnelle. |`|TzJfBZc6aa	a la maternité on m'avais dit d'apporter une couverture, une fois a la maison j'ai continué avec la couverture. plus grand je lui ai acheté une gigoteuse. Mais en ce mois d'aout je le laisse en body ou juste en pijama de coton. |`|H2DiICWxaa	A la maternité, moi c'était turbulette mais de toute fa?on ce n'est pas encore le moment où la couverture est dangereuse, car les nouveau-nés ne bougent pas énormément. Mais après 4 mois, un bébé peu énormément bougé durant son sommeil et se trouver coincé sous la couverture.|`|TH3yzReRaa	Très bonne question !<br>  Je me la suis posée aussi.<br>  Je suppose que c'est parce qu'ils considèrent que le drap et la couverture tiennent plus chaud que la gigoteuse et qu'il y a tjs quelqu'un dans la chambre, près du bébé, pour le surveiller. Sauf que la nuit.... Enfin, à cet age là, le bébé ne bouge presque pas....<br>  C'est vrai que ce n'est pas logique tout ?a... (et sur ma liste d'affaires à prévoir pour la mat' ils ne parlent pas de gigoteuse)|`|r2nQTJAQaa	Je me posais la même question : à la maternité ma puce avait des couverture alors qu'ils nous disent que c'est dangereux pour le bébé...<br>  |`|zTi91kMDaa	a la amternité j'ai ramené une gigoteuse car les draps et oreillers sont interdits elle est bizarre ta maternité c'est pas normal c'est risqué de faire ce qu'ils font prends une gigoteuse au moins jusqu'a 18 mois|`|f476cb13d984e9778ab33e0fd7d52ea4aa	c'est vrai<br>  je m'etias fait la meme reflexion<br>  <br>  cela dit, a 3-4 jours, ils bougent pas encore assez pour se mettre en dessous de la couverture<br>  <br>

eHNLCoZTaa	I believe in community raised children.  What do i mean?  I mean it is the job of the community to make sure children behave and not just the parent.  Parent's can't see everything and too often don't hear of everything that goes on with their children outside of the house, but if you are keeping communication alive between yourself, your neighbors and the parents in the neighborhood, you will find out so much more information about your children.  When you don't, your children lose that accountability.<br>  <br>  If the parents don't "see" their child's behavior as being wrong, then you can punish the child if the child is playing at your house or you can prevent your child from playing with the misbehaving one.<br>  <br>  If the parents didn't see what their child did and they are not around, yes, punish the child, chastise the child and make sure the parents find out.  <br>  <br>  The children in my neighborhood respect me for this.  They know that I care for them and they come knock on my door if they need help retrieving toys or other items they can't get.  They also know that they need to watch their behavior in front of me just like they do in front of their own parents.<br>  <br>  Other neighboring parents do the same for me, so I find out when my children are doing something wrong or potentially dangerous.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Depends what you mean by discipline of their child Also the circumstances you are involved with this child.<br>  Anything physical is a no no .<br>  <br>  ( Connie Mom of 4 and 5th. Grade Teacher )|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	If they are in your care.... yes<br>  <br>  and/or<br>  <br>  If they are not in your care but are doing something that can do harm to themselves or someone else... yes<br>  <br>  .....Provided you are respecting their parents wishes regarding the form of discipline|`|isokr9cfaa	If the parents aren't around and you don't hit them in any way yes it's ok. The reason I say if they're not around is because if you punish their children in front of them it will make them look inferior to their kids. Also, it will make them feel dumb if someone is punishing their kids and their not. But if you're babysitting and the kid throws a toy at your head, by all means put them in the corner for a few minutes. I would discuss discipline with the parents though and decide what's acceptable punishment to them.|`|pPDpj0bRaa	Well, everyone is SOME body's child, and as our children advance through school and activities, we expect and HOPE that someone, other than us, will apply discipline as necessary.<br>  <br>  But it sounds like you're talking about a youngster who is, well, young. And this is where we need to look at the difference between authority figures and parents. If you are the child's aunt or other adult relative whom the child often spends time with, then the answer leans towards a "yes," apply such discipline as the parent might apply (short of physical abuse, of course).<br>  <br>  But if you really don't know the child, and are just observing misbehavior while the parent in distracted, that's different. You used the word, "inappropriate," which suggest nothing dangerous or really serious; perhaps picking the nose and putting the goodies in the salad bar, that sort of thing. Well, I guess that could be dangerous ..<br>  <br>  But anyway, under such circumstances as you really don't know either the kid or the parent, then your best bet is to tell the parent what you observed, in the nature of a heads-up, "by the way," kind of thing.<br>  <br>  So what's the difference between authority figures and parents? Mainly, authority figures -as such- often have the right to deploy discipline as part of their job or position. The kid is sent into a situation where the parent knows there are authority figures; and, while they may not be personally known to the parent, the authority figure is assumed to be qualified to apply discipline. Teachers, Scout Masters, coaches, camp counselors, those sorts of people. While there may be disagreement that the particular discipline was appropriate to the offense, there is rarely disagreement that application of discipline is part of the job.<br>  <br>  And this brings us to the "good old days," which I, at 6 decades, can now say I experienced. Back in those days, before styrofoam cups and Gameboys and just as TV was gettting started, kids went outdoors to play unless the weather was truly ungodly. Kids and people's pets roamed the streets, frequently one being mistaken for the other. I actually knew a kid who answered to "Damnit." The neighborhood was an extension of home. And adults had no problem applying discipline when and as needed. Not physically, of course, but very strictly and firmly. Strangly, the kids, realizing they were under constant surveillance, tended to behave.<br>  <br>  I said, "tended." But when someone's pears were too good to resist, or a certain backyard begged for a hole to be dug in it -zap! The adult appeared, told us to get out, told us what we were doing was wrong, and told us they would call our parents.<br>  <br>  You always knew that your parents HAD received the call whenever the first question over the dinner table was, "What did you do today."<br>  <br>  The mayor of my little town, attempting to locate a stolen bicycle, happened to know the kid who either did it -or who knew who DID do it. The mayor said to the little boy: "If you know who took Tommy's new bike, you tell him to give it back, or I'll have him killed." Miraculously, Tommy's new wheels appeared on his front lawn within a few hours. <br>  <br>  Then there was Mrs. Hitchins, the old widow woman who tired of the kids stealing her watermelons. She posted a sign in the garden which displayed a skull and crossbones and said, "One of these watermelons has been poisoned." Well, we figured, if we can't have a melon, neither can she. Someone crossed out the word, "One," and put the word "Two" over it. I swear it wasn't me.<br>  <br>  So, anyway, notions of who carries the stick change over time and for the life of me I can see no improvement from my old neighborhood days as a kid. Thank you for a thoughtful question.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	If the parents are there and do not see, I would point out the inappropriate behavior to them IF it is affecting you or your child.  If it's not, probably best to stay out of it.  If it is affecting your child, you point it out and it is still not taken care of, I would definitely say something to the child.  If they're not going to make the kid behave, I will if it's affecting my child.  |`|x0bJmyDPaa	If the parents are present, then no it's not OK.  If, however, you are babysitting and the parents are absent, then yes - but not spanking/yelling.|`|sIL7H8RBaa	If someone else's child is in your home (ie - your child is having a friend over) and the parents are not present, then it is your job to be the authority figure and enforce your house's rules.  If the parents are present, it is up to them to discipline or not discipline their child.  That is the way I see it.  That doesn't mean go behind their back and teach their kid a lesson - that just means that it's not your job to parent if the child's parents are present.|`|AVyiKfKCaa	If you are the care taker and the parent is not present, then yes it's your responsibility to get them in line.  If the parents aren't even paying attention I take the liberty of verbally correcting their child for them and tell the parent to pull their head out their rear and act like a parent.  <br>  <br>  For the record spanking is not violence, but I wouldn't spank anyone else's child.  You just don't know what kind of wild tale a child can come up with.|`|AA11822019	I think by verbally telling them you do your part, we all are responsible for our society's children one way or another and as long as you don't use harsh language but show them how important respect and self respect is, they will get some of it, their parents need to step up.|`|q2Y9SzpXaa	Yes.  One time my daughter was playing with a little boy in one of those mall play areas, and out of no where he started hitting my daughter in the face.  I went straight up to him and yelled YOU DO NOT HIT HER.  I wanted to kick him to the moon.  In those situations, yes it is ok to say something.  |`|QqWmBcLCaa	Depends.  If it's obviously out-of-control, yes.  Just weigh the risks first...

oWzJ0Gvbaa	je suis enceinte de mon deuxieme. J'ai pris l'avion, les deux fois jusqu'à 7 mois. Mon mari et moi faisons régulièrement des trajets en voiture de plus de 250 km. (une fois par mois). <br>  <br>  Si la grossesse se passe bien, il n'y a pas de problèmes. Pour la rassurer, voici ce qu'elle pourrait faire avant son trajet de voiture. Vérifier l'emplacement des h?pitaux sur la route et autres services de santé. Sauf si elle part en amazonie, il y en a. De plus, faire un plan avec des arrêts "pipi". L'inconvénient de la femme enceinte oblige ! Arrêts bouffe aussi. Avec tout ?a, s'assurer que les téléphones portables capte bien et tout ira pour le mieux. <br>  <br>  Il ne faut pas s'empêcher de sortir et de bouger quand on est enceinte car après l'arriver du bébé, tout ?a devient beaucoup plus... difficile. Ils doivent en profiter pendant qu'ils ont encore une possibilité de "liberté", si je peux m'exprimer ainsi. <br>  <br>  p.s. si elle a des nausés, ce qui arrive souvent durant le premier trimestre, elle peut demander une prescription a son docteur. Diclectin qu'on appel chez nous. Il empêche les nausés pour la femme enceinte et elle fera de beaux rêves durant son voyage en voiture ou en avion !<br>  <br>  Bonne chance aux futurs parents !|`|e6zZEQq0aa	C'est à elle de décider si elle se sent de voyager ou pas. Certaines femmes ont très peur de la fausse couche et évitent de prendre le moindre petit risque...?a ne se commande pas et ?a ne se juge pas non plus. Tout dépend des femmes et de la fa?on dont elles vivent leur grossesse. Même si la grossesse de ton amie se passe sans sou?is, elle craint sans doute de faire quelque chose qui puisse être dangereux pour son bébé. |`|BNExLmZzaa	Et bien t'as qu'à lui dire que si elle se permet de faire de l'accrobranche et de fumer, elle peut aussi faire un trajet en voiture si sa grossesse se passe bien ! C'est simplement qu'elle doit chercher des excuses pour pas y aller. <br>  Moi je suis bien parti en vacances cet été, j'ai plus de 800 bornes aller-retour et je vais bien !<br>  Si elle a peur, faut qu'elle aille voir sa gynéco.|`|ryXQ3Luuaa	il n'y a pas vraiment de règles en la matière, car tout dépend de la femme et comment elle vit sa grossesse .. <br>  je faisais mes 140 km par jour et ce jusqu'à 8 mois sans problème, d'autres s'arreteront bien avant car il y a un risque important .. <br>  <br>  seulement comme tu le dis, elle fume, elle fait de l'accrobranche, <br>  si c'etait mon amie, je lui demanderais volontiers qu'elle te dise franchement qu'elle n'a pas envie de venir, plutot que d'inventer des excuses bidon. <br>  <br>  |`|X3BkVWosaa	la grossesse n'est pas une maladie, il est donc sur que cela ne sert à rien de stresser pour tout et rien. maintenant, c'est sur qu'il vaut mieux prendre le plus de précausion pausible. donc conseil lui d'en parler à son médecin ou son gynéco qui saura bien la conseiller la dessus.<br>  après rien n'est impossible.. ma mère a perdu un bb à 6 mois de grossesse. son médecin lui avait dit que tout allait très bien et qu'elle pouvait partir en vacances mais finalement elle a fait une fausse couche qui serai du justement  à la voiture.<br>  <br>  mais chaque femme et chaque grossesse sont différentes donc si pas de problème du coté du gynéco, pas de raison de s'en inventer!|`|0qSq6omNaa	j'habite REIMS et je suis partis à mulhuse ( alsace )  pendant mon 8 ème mois de grossesse.....<br>  s?re, j'avais toujoujrs envie de pipi mais à part ?a il  n'y a pas de contre indication...<br>   c'est long, bébé bouge mais tant que tu ne travrese pas 150 dos d'anes tous va bien<br>  courage......|`|NAMjLgWAaa	bah falait la pousser de labre!!le pb aurai ete regler (humour bien sur)! non mais qui est mieux placer pour repondre a ce genre de question que son propre medecin???!!!!<br>  et ske tu pense a la rigueur on s'en fou a moins que tu sois medecin et a ce compte la si t'es medecin ta pa besoin de nos conseils!!!<br>  donc conseille la de voir ca avec son docteur!!! sa sera meixu pr tt le monde!!<br>  <br>  @ princesse au petit pois avant decrire des coneries renseigne toi, les compagnie aerienne refuse les femme enceinte apres 8 mois!!!|`|D2vW0uCCaa	bah moi perso ca me provoque des contractions la voiture mais bon noramlement pour elle y a pas de soucis mais je ne suis pas medecin il vaudrai mieux qu elle demande a son gygy il lui dira ce qu il en pense!!!!<br>  <br>  @ elle est malade de faire de l accro branche a trois mois de grossesse il faut pas deconner quand meme!!!<br>  a mon avis elle essaye d esquiver le voyage plutot qu autre chose|`|d3613d486b19548f85c0a0ba90e73d01aa	Si elle veut vraiment être rassurée, une seule solution, qu'elle téléphone à son gynéco.|`|be94fa379716df74d4695a2e0717cc04aa	moi, j'étais enceinte de trois mois environs quand on est partis en vacances,ca s'est trés bien passé, il faut quand meme demander avant la permission au gynéco et au docteur.|`|YsFzUG7oaa	on n est pas a sa place donc on peut pas juger tiens moi jai plus le droit a 30 mn a etre assise ou debout mon col est ouvert depuis 4 semaines et jen ai encore pour 4 mois si je tiens bon je suis allitée donc je ne vais meme pas dans la famille ki habite ma ville si il comprenne pas tant pis moi je protege mon loulou!!!|`|IPpPfU5gaa	Alors déjà, on ne prend l'avion que jusqu'à 6 mois, pas 8...<br>  Ensuite, peut-être que tu l'as comprendras mieux lorsque tu seras enceinte...|`|LDY0foIyaa	A mon avis, et je suis très sérieux, elle doit y aller à pied.

omfxPGyraa	Reinforce trust.  It's important for the child to feel secure before they will fall into sleep deep enough for them to remain sleep while you put them down.  How deep do you sleep when you're on edge?   He's old enough to just realize that he is no longer with you, and like most babies they long to be at the side of their parents.  Make sure he is comfortable and well fed before laying him down.  Tell him exactly whats going to happen (they understand everything).  Let them know its bedtime, and talk them through the whole routine.  <br>  Make sure that they are sleeping limply before you even attempting to lay him down.  You can try this by lifting an arm or leg and letting it fall (not too far though).  If they stop their arm before it reaches the surface, or become aware that they are being stimulated, they are not completely sleep.  If the arm falls loosely, and the child remains comfortably sleep, then they are sleeping well enough to lay them down.  |`|Xc02z608aa	put him down before he is FAST alseep....put him down when he is drowsy so the motion of putting him down doesn't shock him awake.  That's all I got, sorry :)|`|AA12285245	That's what my daughter does when she's cold.  Try putting some socks or a onesie on him under his sleeper.  Lay him down on top of a blanket that you're holding with him so he gets some body heat.  It may be that he's got some separation anxiety too.  You could try patting his back instead of picking him up.|`|qxzHVpQhaa	Try feeding him and giving him a good warm bath just before bed. I always liked to massage mine with baby lotion or vaseline lotion.<br>  <br>  Good luck, it is always so heartbreaking when they cry at that age and younger, because they can't tell you what's wrong.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	He training you!  He has figured out that when he cries, he gets what he wants, which is you coming back in.  It's really hard, but you have to let him cry it out and take back the control or he will continue doing this as long as you let him.  Good luck! <br>  <br>  DO NOT take the advice to lay with him til he falls asleep!  I did that with my son and would have to lay down in the middle of the day EVERYDAY until he was 3 to get him to nap and then again at night to get him to sleep.  Time consuming and then you HAVE to be someplace with a bed you can both lay on to get them to nap.  Bad, bad idea to start that.|`|tekfj1X3aa	I know you will hear many people say that you can't spoil your baby, however I think they are wrong. Your son has seem to pick up on the fact that all he has to do is cry and you will be back to get him. He is playing you. Cute are they not...and smart. Let him cry it out. It won't kill him and he will learn to sleep in the crib. It doesn't mean that you don't love him, you are not abandoning him. Don't let him cry it out all night, just 10 to 20 minutes at a time, then go back in and comfort him. He will relearn to go to sleep in his crib. It may take a couple of nights, but he will get use to it. Good Luck!|`|ciCBs87Uaa	Hi, I had the same problem with my 7 month old, sometimes, she goes right to sleep and other times, she starts crying like there's no tomorrow. What I usually do now, is lay on the couch with her, and watch TV. Since she is really tired, she goes to sleep right away, and after 5 minutes or so, I take her up to her crib. I know it's not the best solution, but as long as she's happy and sleeping, I don't mind. I really don't know what else to think of, this is my solution. Hope it helps.|`|qx3MCh2Naa	let him cry for 10 or 15 minutes. if he is still crying then go into the room but don't pick him up. just try to soothe him by patting him and talking gently to him. he knows that if he cries like this you will come and pick him up. anyway, leave after a minute or two. he must learn how to put himself to sleep. it's hard and it may take a week or so, but you have to be tough.|`|ikgFu4W8aa	With a 6 month old myself, I know how this can be.   Babies don't like to go to sleep because they think they are missing out on everything..or they are not tired.   Make sure to tire your baby out by playing with them or letting them play with toys for awhile before putting them down.  And once you put them down, they will cry and scream, but just let them.   Eventually they will tire and fall asleep.  If you keep picking them up everything they fuss, they will learn that they have you under control and that you will come running everytime they make a noise.  You have to train them that, 'Hey, once I put you down to sleep, no matter how much your cry, I am not going to come to get you'.   It took a week or two, but my daughter will fuss for about 2 minutes now, then pass right out.

5f9d6afb88bd1354d5e3aecf4e4d5f44aa	Le lait arrive un peu à la fois mais chaque femme est différente donc la quantité l'est aussi ... il y a des femmes pour lesquelles elles auront du lait (mais bcp) vers 7 mois de grossesse et d'autres où à 4 mois elles en auront ...à mon 1er je n'ai rien vu coulé avant l'accouchement et même après l'allaitement a été difficile à mon 2nd à la fin de ma grossese je perdais un peu de colostrum au moment de la douche et l'allaitement a duré 2 mois mais à d'après ce que tu mets tu n'es pas s?re d'être enceinte ... et les douleurs aux seins est peut être un signe mais ce n'est pas la montée de lait ! à l'heure où je t'écris peut être as tu déjà eu ton résultat alors ???|`|fc412b5b8015f22950ef0445d485c263aa	autour de 7mois un peu de lait pouvait s'écouler mais avant je ne pense pas|`|79bed6e3fdcfb92e82a2c71fc859bb78aa	Dés les premiers jours! En fait, juste après l'accouchement, on a ce qu'on appelle le "colostrum" (je ne sais pas si l'orthographe est bonne), c'est très nourrissant pour le nouveau-né même si la quantité nous para?t ridicule. Ensuite, plus le sein est sollicité (par le BB ou par le tire-lait) et plus la quantité de lait produite est importante! C'est à partir du 2éme mois d'allaitement que le débit devient important. <br>  Pour ce qui est des masses, je n'ai le souvenir que de seins enflés, c'est tout!!<br>  C'est une très belle aventure l'allaitement! Bon courage! et bon appêtit au BB!|`|07ec08013bacb6bf75c238af2ca27e5caa	Parfois les montées de lait prennent du temps à venir, en asie par ex, elles viennent 10 à 15 jours après la naissance.

C'est d'ailleurs chez moi le premier signe annonciateur d'une grossesse, vu qu'à chaque fois, dès les premiers jours, je me tape une méga paire d'obus douloureux... Dis-toi que le coté positif, c'est que c'est souvent signe d'une bonne capacité à allaiter.

TK1qD234aa	EWE no it sounds like decay|`|3QG851EZaa	Would that be referring to decay, or to Donkey Kong?<br>  <br>  <br>  But, seriously, not a great name.  Even if it didn't sound like either of the above, it is still too informal to be her first name.  It might be okay for a baby, but how does Judge Dee Kay or President Dee Kay sound?|`|YX1NeQJyaa	Sorry but when I think of Dee Kay, I think huge gorilla in Nintendo's games lol. Sorry! What about KayDee or Kay Dee.|`|7d0d302bef52f1187580c3d6f022e46aaa	I like how it sounds, but it would be better as a nickname, as in DK. Dee Kay looks strange.

I know its a tough thing picking out your kids names, and of course you want to have something original, but just remember, the child has to live their lives with the name.  But its your child and your choice, good luck with whatever you choose!|`|L07ICvrRaa	I don't normally put peoples hopes down when it comes to naming, but that just sounds really horrible. It really does sound like decay, and that's just mean. Try Kay Dee. This is your precious little girl we're talking about here, don't make her hate her name and resent you for it later!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	Not really. I don't really like one syllable first names though. If one of the names was more than one syllable, then it would be alot nicer of a name in my opinion.|`|jjWFUcUSaa	DK as in Donkey Kong or decay? No she won't get teased at all.|`|Gd3fvciaaa	eeewwwwie no. she would get teasted so much.

qB2I2JJbaa	L’ovulation<br>  <br>  L’ovulation est la période la plus fertile de votre cycle menstruel. C’est le moment où un ou plusieurs ?ufs sont libérés par l’un de vos ovaires.<br>  <br>  Comprendre L'ovulation<br>  Un seul ?uf est expulsé dans la cavité pelvienne puis entra?né dans les trompes de Fallope. <br>  <br>  Notez bien qu’une femme n'est fertile que quelques jours par mois (vers le 14è jour) sur un cycle menstruel de 28 jours.<br>  <br>  Un ?uf a une durée de vie de 24 heures, le sperme, en revanche a une longévité de 72 heures. Il peut donc y avoir conception si vous avez eu des rapports dans les 2-3 jours précédant l'ovulation. <br>  <br>  Ne vous focalisez surtout pas sur la période où vous devez faire l’amour, vos relations sexuelles pourraient en devenir pénibles.<br>  <br>  En règle générale, une femme tombe enceinte dans l’année. Si les mois passent mais que la situation est inchangée, pensez à aller voir votre gynécologue.Vous pouvez utiliser le test d’ovulation Il vous permettra de mieux repérer la période où vous êtes la plus fertile<br>  |`|p7ArtzkSaa	2 à 3 jours ds le vagin de la femme|`|Fze3sU29aa	Exactement, 56Heures 34minutes et 20 secondes....<br>  le terme durée exacte me fais beaucoup rire.....

En moyenne dit-on entre 48H00 et 72H00 |`|zBXmRdxlaa	3 jours mais compté 2 car il ne doit plus être très vivace le 3ème jour. Donc penser que vous pouvez vous retrouver enceinte 2 jours avant et 2 jours après l'ovulation car l'ovulation est également fécondable pendant 48 hrs.|`|YsFzUG7oaa	cela dépend de la vigourité de celui ci ?a peut aller de 2 a 3 jours parait t il !!!!|`|AGqWN5TSaa	il me semble que c'est 3 jours si j'ai de bons souvenirs en mes cours de sciences naturelles.|`|NAMjLgWAaa	Ils peuvent survivre de 3 à 5 jours dans les voies génitales féminines.

lC8ddwudaa	well...if u stopped taking b.c, then it is a possibility. i believe sperm can live up to 24-48 hours before they die. if you dont get your period on time...you should go get a pregnancy test<br>  <br>  i honestly don't think you have anything to worry about, but like i said, if u miss or are late for your period, best thing to do is go get a preg. test<br>  <br>  hope this helps...  :)|`|EmAUSgZfaa	uhmm yea your friend is right . the sperm can live inside your body for up to 5 or so days i believe . For some woman they cannot get pregnant till a year later because of something to do with the birth control messing up your body then making it confused ? iuno, don't you hear stories about girls getting pregnant from forgetting to take a pill a day or two ? So yea pretty much you can get pregnant .|`|8869c0b77bb8f4ee8906c9bf33814e3daa	i doubt your pregnant. missing one day of birth control shouldnt matter its still in your system. also the women's internal gential area has a natural antibody that attacks the sperm cuz its a foriegn body so only a few sperm actually make it--thats why many women have fertilty problems.<br>  best thing to do is see ur doc and take a preg test|`|QT3Hp8iAaa	Yes. In addition to the sperm living for a while, the only thing the birth control pill does is prevent your ovaries from releasing eggs.  All a person has to do is miss 1 pill and their body can release an egg. Scary thought isnt it?|`|Ujxrpoonaa	Yes sperm can live up to 6 days inside you|`|0eff6c3d6c5384df03e19933d3c8e8cbaa	yes, you could be pregnant,|`|K7H1zrCbaa	Your friend is correct.  hope you dont get pregnant.|`|OXSOch9Oaa	Yes, first of all it has to be in your system for an entire month before it's totally effective.  And yes, sperm can live several days inside you.  That's how a lot of people get pregnant, by having sex a few days before ovulation.  |`|SslNP4qdaa	yes, you can...probably rare, but it can happen.....How long has it been since you stopped taking your pills, read the insert to the pill package,,,they will give you instructions on what to do if you miss a pill or 2.......if it has been within 72 hours, you can take plan B or just call your doctor and ask....keep track of your period dates and make sure you get your next one on time....If you suddenly stopped the pill, then chances are you will get your period a few days after the last pill you took, That's what usually happens.........good luck|`|XEiIYjT7aa	Your friend is right. Sperm can live inside of you for 3-6 days, depending on where they are. Your fallopian tube is structured to catch the sperm so they can lie in wait for your egg to pass by. If you stop your birth control, your chances of pregnancy go up a lot.  |`|XJlVU9Wwaa	its a fact that the sperm can survive up to 2 weeks!!<br>  <br>   so yeah, it is possible that you can get pregnant. I suggest you start praying|`|9y8Gd55haa	I would say your friend is right. You could still end up pregnant.
NAMjLgWAaa	ne pense tu pas qu'en parent digne de se nom et donc responsable que tu devrai poser ce genre de question a monsieur le pediatreou ton medecin???????!!!!!!!!!serieusement pense tu que tu peux te fier aux reponse sur yahoo pour tou et rien , tu croi ke les gen sur yahoo, sont tous d gygy, d pediatre, d medecin dans la rubrik "grossesse et enfant"?,!!<br>   parcke meme si on te done notre avis, si on te di skon en pense, peut etre ke certain vont te repondre sans savoir et donc en t disant nimporte koi!!!!!!toi tu prefere prendre se risk pluto ke de demander au docteur???!!!kel maturité .... kel responsabilité... sa me tue...<br>  <br>  PS: pour ceux ki se permete de repondre, au moins repondez kan vou etes sur parcke (dsl g pa retenu le pseudo) celui ou celle ki ecri ki bebe ne doi pa voyager dans une nacelle a tout faux si ta nacelle est homologuée pour la route BIEN EVIDEMENT ke bebe est BCP mieux ke dans un cosy (et kune nacelle omologuée est tre bien ekiper pr le voyage en voiture!!!) donc jespere ke cete persone na pas d'enfant sa serai dramatik je pense!!!!!!!|`|IPpPfU5gaa	Je pense que s'il est dans un siège adapté et que vous faites des pauses suffisantes il n'y a pas de problème!|`|5PehSHdEaa	il faut faire ttention, à lui, bien l'attacher, normalement à cet age là il dort aussi beaucoup....mais cela n'empêche pas de vérifier souvent si tout va bien  pour lui, si  il n'a pas trop chaud, froid, pipi caca./...moi je surveille tout le temps....et je m'arrête souvent. Mais je pense que rien n'empêche un nourrisson de faire 450km en voiture. Du moment que la voiture est confortable, qu'il est dans son siege auto, attaché, et qu'il voyage dans les meilleurs conditions....<br>  ce n'est pas parce qu'il dort qu'il ne faut pas vérifier si il va bien...aussi (c'est ce que je me dit toujours)...<br>  bonne route.|`|1HKQ7HB2aa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  Tu peux le faire voyager à 1 mois 1/2 sans pb. Il faut seulement veiller à s'arrêter très régulièrement pour le faire boire : de toute fa?on, si tu ne le réveilles pas, il te rapellera à l'ordre :-)<br>  A cet age là, ?a se passe très bien car bb dort presque tout le temps.<br>  <br>  Il faut le faire voyager dans un bon siège auto dos à la route et surtout pas dans une nacelle. La nacelle n'est autorisée qu'en France, en cas de choc, bb n'est pas assez bien protégé.<br>  <br>  Bon voyage|`|780Q1FGaaa	Normalement y a pas de problème.<br>  Je te conseille d'utiliser une nacelle (le bébé est allongé) plutot qu'un cosy (siège), ton bébé sera mieux installé sur pour ce long voyage.
aaf4eb5f5b83feac93a60b6d820fe1f8aa	Bonjour<br>  <br>  Cette jeune fille est atteinte d'énurésie. C'est très commun contrairement à ce qu'on pense, surtout chez les gar?ons. Cela dispara?t naturellement généralement un peu avant l'adolescence, ou un peu plus tard. C'est héréditaire dans la plupart des cas.<br>  <br>  Il existe des traitements médicamenteux, le plus commun est le Minirin. Les médecins conseillent aussi une aide psychologique, je ne sais pas franchement si c'est utile car je suis convaincue qu'il s'agit seulement d'une immaturité des organes en question. <br>  <br>  Comme l'a dit quelqu'un précédemment, il ne faut pas dire "pisser au lit", cette jeune fille doit beaucoup souffrir de la situation et ce n'est pas la peine d'employer des termes comme ca. Ca me blesse un peu personnellement, étant une ex-enuretique.<br>  <br>  En attendant, tu peux toujours conseiller à cette amie l'utilisation des dry nites de huggies, ce sont des couches spécialement con?ue pour les adolescents qui mouillent leur lit, elles sont trés discrètes.<br>  <br>  Bonne chance|`|Gf1DKDyvaa	bonjour mademoiselle ,  vous devez savoir que ?a se soigne ,la manière dont cela se soigne diffère d'un pays à l'autre vous n'avez pas précisé votre pays sinon dans mon pays les gens préfèrent  utiliser des medicaments traditionnels parce que pour ?a le médecin demande de ne pas boire la nuit ou de ne pas trop manger la nuit et de faire pipi avant de dormir seulement ce qui n'est pas toujours efficace. Dans d'autres pays on peut lui faire rencontrer un psychologue pour voir ce qui l'emmène à continuer à faire pipi sur elle la nuit. Aussi vous pouvez veiller à ce qu'elle ne boive pas trop avant de dormir et ensuite la réveiller la nuit pour qu'elle aille aux toilettes et si elle est habituée elle se réveillera toute seule la nuit pour faire pipi.|`|X6mOjUh8aa	il faut qu'elle consulte un spécialiste (un urologue ou un psy) il y a des gouttes nasales qui font un super effet pour le pipi le soir ainsi qu'une alimentation surveillée|`|rEvTHOsVaa	le bebe pese lourd sur ta vessie et il l ecrase, donc pipi tout le temps!!!|`|da3c1a3e6e6a6ffd29819b3832af687eaa	Déjà cause meilleur, parce que comme tu le dis c'est vraiment rabaissant pour elle!<br>  Il peut y avoir deux sortes de causes pour ce genre de problème, sui se nomme eunurésie: cause physique, les sphoncters ne fonctionnent pas bien, cause psychologique quand quelque chose ne va pas bien. |`|4doaQALNaa	c'est ennuyant mais ?a finit toujours par partir même sans traitement.|`|1df388dac4163f41fb1cf39427addc49aa	tu peux lui donner l'adresse d'un urologue et d'un psy aussi !<br>  chez les gar?ons l'énurésie est assez fréquente jusqu'à parfois 7/8 ans mais chez les filles c'est plus rare<br>  mais ?a se soigne comme beaucoup de choses<br>  ne croies-tu pas que c'est à ses parents de s'en occuper ?|`|NAMjLgWAaa	loulou  cete personne parle dune enfant de 12 ans pas dune femme enceinte!!!!<br>  <br>  mai pr te repondre je pense aussi qu'l faudrai quelle consulte et que c'est bien de vouloir l'aider mais pourcela commence deja par changer ton language tres pejoratif et vulgaire vis a vis d'elle!!!|`|YBcapzqjaa	Outre certains traitements qui sont à identifier et à adapter, il y a sans doute aussi un manque de musculation de la zone pelvienne et des sphincters, ainsi que du périnée.|`|7pcdrfP8aa	Mon neveu a 9 ans et lui aussi fait pipi au lit tout les soirs. Son médecin lui a prescrit un traitement, mais je ne saurai te dire lequel.<br>  <br>  Le mieux, c'est qu'elle consulte.<br>  <br>  PS : faut qu'elle se fasse à l'idée, qu'un jour où l'autre un médecin verra son organe. Entre les visites chez le gynéco et l'accouchement, elle pourra pas y échappé.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?a me fait penser à mon frère, il avait 15 ans lorsqu'il a remarqué qu'il avait le frein trop court. Lui non plus ne voulait pas aller consulter. Mais à force de discuter, il était pour à condition que ce soit moi qui l'amène chez un urologue.<br>  Dis à ton amie d'essayer de voir si sa soeur serait d'accord pour que ce soit elle qui l'amène. C'est toujours plus facile d'aller avec sa soeur, son frère, une cousine qu'avec les parents.

Cool !!!<br>  <br>  Comme dit par les précédentes QRistes, tout a l'air de bien aller pour ton bébé. Si tu as des questions, n'hésite pas à demander à l'échographiste, ou bien au gynéco qui suit ta femme. Ils pourront te dire précisément ce qu'il en est. Et comme dit Jeddy, si l'échographiste ne dit rien, c'est que tout va bien ! Ils ne sont pas très bavards en général.<br>  <br>  Et puis, déstresse ! Si tu commences à t'inquiéter autant alors que bébé n'est pas encore né, ?a promet pour ses 1ers pas :D<br>  <br>  Tout va bien et si la future maman se sent bien aussi, eh bien, profitez donc de ces moments de découverte :-)<br>  <br>  Félicitations, et bonne continuation !|`|NAMjLgWAaa	tu aurai du demander a lechographe a la fin de lexamen pr ne pas le deranger sinon voi avec ta femme kan elle va au medecin...<br>  sinon moi je sui une futur maman 5 mois de grossesse, c ma 1ere, mai lors de ma 1ere echo, on distingue le bébé ce n'est pas net comme celle du 5eme mois, et le fait qu'il bouge moins je ne pense pas que ce soit inquiétant sinon l'echographe vous aurai preciser sil y avait un pb ou  koi ke se soi kel precaution prendre si le bebe avai un pb etc... ne tinkiete pas<br>  ensuite pour la clarté nucale,elle est mesurer pour deceler une malformation et suivan ce resulta dotre examen son prescri si necessaire etc... et je me sui renseigner aussi donc jai lu ke juska 3mm c t considerer kom normal... mai je ne peu absolulmen pa te dire oui tou risk est ecarter ou non... ms jaurai envie de te dire ke malgre tou le risk zero nexiste pas , mai ke c pa pr autan kil fau pa voir les chose positivemen... bon courage biz|`|OcDKTbvcaa	ZEN!<br>  s'il y avait eu un soucis, l'échographe vous en aurait parler ne t'inquiètes pas. De plus, un bébé dort beaucoup et ne bouge pas forcément "à la demande" donc pas de problème. La clarté nuccale a l'air très bien pas de soucis non plus.<br>  Allez courage et calme, il reste encore du chemin à parcourir avant sa venue au monde!|`|48a21bc4a622371e98beb983ee0cf2b1aa	son visage était moins "naturel": ben c'est parce que les os se forment mais forcément ?à ressemble pas à ce qu'on imagine. on dirait pas un "bébé" et c'est logique. A 12SA il est loin d'être formé.<br>  <br>  est ce normal que le f?tus bouge moins d'une écho à l'autre: oh oui bien s?r. Si il dormait ou si il était juste "au calme" c'est normal. A la prochaine écho il dansera peut être un rock endiablé et ?à sera normal aussi. Tant que le rythme cardiaque est bon pas de soucis!<br>  <br>  La clarté nucale (1 mm) semblait normale et le tube neural était bien visualisé: ?à se sont les risques de trisomie qui sont écartés. Le spina bifida c'est le fait que la colonne vertébrale soit ouverte. donc tant qu'il a rien dit c'est qu'elle est fermée et que tout va bien!<br>  <br>  Un tout petit conseil: n'hésitez jamais, jamais, à poser vos questions pendant l'écho ou pendant tout autre examen. même si vous pensez que vous allez avoir l'air bête. Ce sont toujours les praticiens les mieux placés pour vous expliquer clairement et complètement sur ces sujets là.<br>  <br>  Une petite "traduction" du langage de médecin: quand un médecin ne dit rien c'est que c'est normal et que tout va bien. Ils ne disent jamais "c'est chouette tout est ok". Par contre si quelque chose ne va pas ils le disent.<br>  <br>  Et enfin: Félicitations futur papa!!! |`|c804b9bcb4ac5383837cc1c6d7a2f017aa	N'ACCOMPAGNE PLUS TA FEMME A L'ECHOGRAPHIE !<br>  <br>  Je n'ai jamais vu quelqu'un d'aussi angoissé après une échographie: <br>  la grossesse n'est pas une maladie, la plus part des grossesses se déroulent bien et la majorité des problèmes lors d'une grossesse ne sont pas des problèmes qui se détectent lors de l'échographie.<br>  <br>  As-tu des raisons de croire que ton bébé pourrait souffrir d'une malformation?<br>  <br>  Ou bien est-ce que tu ne serais pas en train de développer un syndrome de Munchausen par procuration avant même la naissance de ton enfant?<br>  <br>  Pour répondre à tes questions<br>  1- je ne sais pas à quoi ressemblait les images de l'échographie mais en général les images sont rarement nette à 12SA le f?tus ne fait que 7,5 cm comment veux-tu distinguer nettement un visage aussi petit?<br>  <br>  2- Il est parfaitement normal que le f?tus ne bouge pas tout le temps: encore heureux même imagine si c'était le cas la fatigue de la maman quand elle le sentira bouger si il ne s'arrêtait jamais. <br>  <br>  3- Je ne vais pas te faire plaisir mais je vais être honnête même avec une échographie plus tardive on n'est pas capable de détecter toutes les malformations. Alors non tout risque n'est pas écarté mais pourquoi te focaliser sur les risques et ne pas considérer au contraire que ta femme est en train de vous fabriquer un fantastique petit bébé, il sera bien temps de vous inquiéter de choses plus concrètes quand il sera là comme il ne s'endort pas, il fait des colique, il fait ses dents etc...<br>

D'autres signes annoncent aussi une grossesse des seins volumineux et douloureux, une forte envie de dormir, des nausées et des vertiges le sentiment d'être barbouillée ou au contraire une envie de manger tout le temps, une humeur instable... <br>  <br>  Si vous connaissez quelques uns de ces signes, en plus de l'absence de règles, vous pouvez partir en direction de la pharmacie ou prendre rendez-vous avec votre médecin!<br>  <br>  Le test de grossesse<br>  Il est vendu en pharmacie, sans ordonnance, et permet de détecter l'hormone HCG présente dans votre urine lorsque vous êtes enceinte. Il se présente sous forme de batonnet à passer sous le jet d'urine pendant quelques secondes. Si vous êtes enceinte, une coloration apparait sur la bandelette au bout de quelques minutes. Ce test est fiable à 99% s'il est positif. S'il est négatif, il est conseillé de le refaire deux ou trois jours plus tard. Pour avoir le résultat le plus fiable possible, laissez bien le test sous votre urine durant le nombre de secondes indiquées dans le mode d'emploi, et posez-le horizontalement en attendant le résultat. N'oubliez pas : un test positif signifie presque toujours que vous êtes enceinte, mais un test négatif ne doit pas totalement exclure une grossesse. Pour être vraiment sure, le mieux reste la prise de sang.<br>  <br>  La prise de sang<br>  Vous pouvez vous rendre chez votre médecin qui vous prescrira une prise de sang remboursée par la sécurité sociale. Cette analyse consiste à rechercher le taux d'hormone HCG présent dans votre sang, et peut être faite dès le premier jour de retard des règles. Les résultats sont fiables à 100%, et permettent même de déterminer la date de fécondation!<br>  <br>  Donc attend un retard de règles et tu sera fixer <br>  |`|6d393e89f624db9e7e1c489aec21df73aa	On parle de sympt?me pour une maladie, à moins de considérer qu'une grossesse est une maladie ... mais c'est peut-être comme ?a que l'on voit les choses aujourd'hui après tout. <br>  |`|5diAdQbhaa	surtout absence de regles et vomissement|`|98322122f152865cd65551345f0ae3f8aa	tu as le ventre qui gonfle !!!|`|FaYAoi6Oaa	chaque femme est differente, certaines auront des symptomes mal de tête, nausée, seins qui piquent ou qui grossissent, arrêt de regle, constipation ... et d'autres n'auraont rien du tout<br>  en cas de doute une prise de sang ou un test pour confirmer une grossesse ou non|`|NAMjLgWAaa	symptome??? tu croi ke la grossesse est une maladie??si c sa avorte vite!!!<br>  ce sont des "signes" et chak femme reagi diferemen, et le mal de tete ne signifie pas ke tu es enceinte, les plus repandu son labsence de regle, les nausee et les sein douloureu consulte un medeccin sa serai mieu je pense!!|`|jgDCr8J6aa	je n'ai eu absolument aucun symptome....

64xxob5Kaa	Non. votre généraliste ira sauf si votre grossesse est pathologique.<br>  <br>  Déjà, puisqu'il faut le répéter : un gynécologue ne suit aucune grossesse, c'est l'obstétricien qui le fait (tous les gynéco ne sont pas obs et tous les obs ne sont pas gynéco)<br>  <br>  Le seul avantage de l'obstétricien est s'il fait ses propres échographies. S'il vous envoie les faire ailleurs, ?a n'a plus aucun intérêt d'avoir un obs (puisqu'il ne verra que le compte-rendu des écho qui auront été interprétées par l'échographiste, donc comme si vous étiez suivie par un généraliste)<br>  <br>  Alors évidemment, certains essaieront de vous faire peur mais<br>  - des obs qui "loupent" un trisomique, il y en a quelques centaines par an (la majorité des trisomiques qui naissent, le sont de mères de moins de 38 ans sans antécédents, et la clareté nuquale n'est pas visible pour tous, donc pas d'amnio demandées)<br>  - J'ai aussi vu un obs rater des jumeaux. Ils s'en sont aper?us lors de l'accouchement !<br>  <br>  Allez voir le médecin<br>  - en qui vous avez confiance<br>  - qui vous re?oit sans difficulté<br>  - où vous pouvez aller à pied, pres de chez vous si possible.<br>  <br>  De toute fa?on, vous devez aller voir votre généraliste car même si vous êtes suivie par un obstétricien, ils doivent, tous les deux se donner les éléments de votre dossier. Votre obstétricien doit faire suivre un compte-rendu de consultation à votre généraliste, les copies des analyses etc (s'il ne le fait pas, c'est un mauvais médecin, fuyez)<br>  C'est très important si vous tombez malade durant votre grossesse : ce n'est pas un gynéco qui soignera une bronchite ! Donc votre généraliste doit savoir où vous en êtes, les médicaments que vous prenez, ce que donnent les analyses pour le sucre, les analyses sérologiques etc.<br>  <br>  Commencez par aller voir votre médecin de famille qui va faire le nécessaire au niveau analyse, vous conseiller sur les maternités du coin (s'il vous déconseille une sans vouloir vous dire pourquoi, c'est qu'il sait qu'il y a un incompétent notoire qui y sévit, mais la déontologie lui interdit de vous le dire explicitement), les sages-femmes mieux que d'autres ou médecin accoucheur. Il vous parlera aussi des différentes méthodes de préparation à l'accouchement. Bref, avec lui, vous aurez un panorama et un aide à la prise de décision.<br>  <br>  Ps pour Zentillegirafe : beaucoup d'obs ont le matériel adéquat pour les écho. Je n'ai jamais été les faire ailleurs (et l'obs du cabinet qui n'était pas gynéco, venait faire les siennes avec le matos de ma gynéco-obs).|`|RJG4DtBdaa	par obligation car il va te demander des faire des analyses comme aussi il va te proposer des médicaments aussi donc seulement un gynécolo peut savoir plus |`|fd702409f751b531f4f7cf1c8a37211daa	Tu fais comme tu veux.<br>  pour mon premier, j'ai été suivie par mon généraliste les 7 premiers mois, puis par un gynéco de la maternité pour les 2 dernieres visites (il me semble, c'est une obligation). Pour les échos, c'était une sage-femme spécialisée à la maternité.<br>  Pour mon deuxième, j'ai été suivie par une sage-femme libérale les 7 premiers mois, puis par un gynéco de la maternité. Pour les échos, encore la même sage-femme que pour la 1ère grossesse.<br>  Je ne souhaitais pas être suivie par un gynéco, parce que chez moi, ils sont débordés et t'expédient en 10 min. En outre, les gynécos de la maternité (tous super) ne suivent en début de grossesse que les cas "difficiles" et je trouve ?a bien normal, priorité aux grossesses à risque.<br>  Bref, tu peux te faire suivre par ton généraliste sans problème au début, mais pense à appeler la maternité, ils te fixeront les RDV de fin de grossesse et éventuellement les échos.|`|7c7a714db7baaea51850b118dec61b02aa	tu n'es pas obligée d'être suivie chez un gynécologue ou un obstétricien, tu peux rester chez ton médecin généraliste sans problème et celui-ci t'enverra chez un obstétricien pour les 2 ou 3 dernières visites si ta grossesse n'est pas à risque.<br>  <br>  pour les échographies obligatoires, elles ne sont pas réalisées chez l'obstétricien avec son petit appareil de surveillance, mais soit dans un cabinet spécialisé, soit à l'hopital où ils ont le matériel nécessaire, personnellement quand j'ai vu les échographies du premier obstétricien que j'ai consulté, j'ai pas été rassurée, ils ne voient vraiment pas grand chose, juste le minimum (après ?a dépend de l'outillage de ton obstétricien, mais en principe en cabinet ils n'ont pas du matériel très performant).<br>  <br>  et j'ai lu qu'une personne avait dit qu'un généraliste était passé à c?té d'un cas de trisomie... mais ?a n'a rien à voir avec le généraliste, puisque c'est la personne qui analyse l'échographie qui aurait pu voir si le bébé était trisomique si c'était visible (et ce n'est pas toujours le cas), et aussi l'analyse des risques qu'on propose aux mamans, pas le généraliste qui n'a que le compte rendu.<br>  <br>  de plus, ton généraliste te connait et pourra être plus attentif à ton cas. maintenant c'est toi qui vois.|`|IPpPfU5gaa	c'est une question de bon sens je crois... évidement, il faut être suivie par un gyneco. Après, rien n'est obligatoire, vous faites comme vous voulez...|`|blegGbkkaa	non tu n'es obligée de rien. Mais c'est mieux pour ta santé et celle de ton enfant|`|6dbc0a3db570380276e5d0eb26477e0aaa	Non c'est pas obligatoire, tu peux te faire suivre par un généraliste ou par une sage femme aussi.<br>  <br>  Mais vers la fin, genre 7e mois, il t'orientera vers un gynéco qui sera ton médecin accoucheur.<br>  <br>  Après, je pense que chacun a sa spécialité et j'ai des doutes quant aux compétences du généraliste.<br>  Au début de ma grossesse, faute de disponibilités de ma gynéco c'est mon généraliste qui m'a suivie. A la 1ère écho à 1 mois de grossesse passé, il n'y avait qu'un oeuf clair... j'étais complètement paniquée et il m'a super mal expliqué ce qui arrivait. Paniqué lui aussi, il a téléphoné à ma gynéco en lui demandant de me recevoir en urgence...<br>  <br>  Je retombe enceinte, et j'ai du aller le voir pour qu'il me fasse ma déclaration de grossesse. Il m'a sorti un vieux papier tout jauni de derrière les ****** en me disant 'bouh la la ?a fait longtemps que j'en ai pas fait dis donc...'. Effectivement, son formulaire datait d'avant les années 2000 et m'a été renvoyé par la sécu et la caf car plus utilisé...<br>  <br>  Cela dit, mon généraliste, je l'adore, mais pour un suivi de grossesse il est 0.<br>  <br>  A toi de voir...|`|e1c619cc0f55aa4b7c5eb3a497341a23aa	Ma généraliste m'a suivie jusqu'au sixième mois. Je me suis toujours sentie à l'aise en en confiance avec elle. Et elle ne suit que les grossesses "normales", age < 35 ans,  si grossesse gemellaire, non, si diabète, non, si risque accru de FC, non, etc. <br>  Puis elle a fait suivre mon dossier à la maternité (CHU) et lors des visites de contr?le je n'avais jamais à faire au même praticien et ?a j'ai pas aimé. Puis j'ai commencé les cours de préparation à l'accouchement avec une SF.<br>  Mon docteur et la SF étaient très dispo, donc hors de visites de contr?les pour des petites choses, j'appelais soit mon doc soit ma SF.<br>  Et ma grossesse s'est déroulée comme un charme.<br>  ?a fait un an que j'ai accouché et tout va bien.<br>  <br>  Voilà. <br>  ^^<br>  <br>  @jout : et les échos se sont passées chez une échographe réputée. un gynéco ne fait pas forcément les échos obligatoires non plus.<br>  <br>  @jout : on dirait bien qu'il y a une armée de poisson-pilote qui poursuit Domil...

Quelle maturité !|`|97e34ec831e49a0ef6234e3a8a69654baa	a chacun son metier!!!apres des etudes de medecine classique,celui qui est devenu gyneco a du faire une specialisation....a quoi ca sert que ducros y se decarcasse!!!!<br>  en cas de probleme le generaliste t'enverra chez le gyneco,autant avoir a faire a celui dont c'est le metier de suivre la grossesse de la femme dans les meilleurs conditions possible.|`|uu1JvB0Naa	La femme d'un collègue de boulot a voulu se faire suivre par un généraliste..le petit est né trisomique, le médecin n'a rien vu. C'est peut être un mauvais hasard, n'empêche que...<br>  Il y a des bons médecins mais s'il existe des spécialités ce n'est pas pour rien non plus.

Que tu fais généralement avec un gynéco. Pour le reste, tu peux être suivie par ton médecin traitant. Il me semble qu'il y a 3 échos obligatoires, si je ne dis pas de bêtises!|`|gRQTgHDoaa	pesonne ne peut t'obliger , mais les echos tu les passent où ?|`|B8XJvG3Kaa	c'est gygy ou parfois sage femme si tu accouches à l'hopital. bonne grossesse.|`|cacbe24ab433d94431e32f43d9461fdeaa	Il n'y a rien d'obligatoire lors d'une grossesse (NON les échos ne sont pas obligatoires! Seulement, 3 sont remboursées) On parle de consultations obligatoires par rapport à la CAF et aux allocations (tu dois faire une déclaration de grossesse avant 15 SG, puis une visite de 4 à 9 mois pour y avoir droit)<br>  Ensuite, certains hopitaux demandent à ce que la consultation du 7, 8 et 9ème mois soient faites chez eux. Ce n'est pas une règle générale et jamais ils refuseront l'accès a la salle de naissance si tu n'as pas été suivi chez eux.<br>  <br>  Sinon, ton médecin généraliste ou une sage-femme sont compétents pour suivre une grossesse sans problème. Mais ils doivent t'orienter vers un gynéco s'ils croient qu'il y a un problème. Pour les écho, c'est toujours mieux d'aller voir un médecin, gynéco ou radiologue, qui fait 20 écho par jour, plutot que celui qui en fait 2 par semaine. L'expérience, en terme de quantité, est très importante dans ce domaine.<br>  <br>  Ensuite, les pouces en bas de Domil, je me trompe p-e mais ca vient surement de sa définition de gynéco et obs...<br>  Il existe 2 sortes de gynécologues: gynécologue-obstétricien et gynécologue médical.<br>  Donc tous les obs sont nécessairement des gynéco, mais tous les gynéco ne sont pas obstétriciens...<br>  Les G-O hospitaliers font autant des accouchements, suivi de grossesse que des hystérectomies...<br>  <br>  |`|MXcaXvI4aa	Salut, vaut mieux voir ta gyneco, car moi pour ma 1er grossesse  au début j'ai tout fais avec mon généraliste, qui a oublié de me faire l'écho à 12semaines pour la trisomie 21, a vrai dire ton généraliste garde le pendant ta grossesse pour tes petits tracas, ou simplement faire le point, mais ta gyneco est plus apte est specialisé dans les accouchements, te dira si ton col va bien, ou si il s'ouvre, ca m'est arrivé pour ma 1er grossesse, actuellement j'attend le second, enceinte de 3 mois. Et a chaque consultation chez ta gyneco, tu auras le plaisir de voir ton petit bout car elle te fais une écho, ta gyneco a tout le materiel et pas ton généraliste, et cela est plutot rassurant pour la futur maman. Voilà, si tu n'as pas de gynéco, prend rdv avec le ou la gyneco de l'hopital ou la clinique que tu as choisi pour accoucher. Biz|`|PDXJLL7zaa	Bonjour,tout d'abord toutes mes félicitations.Enuite je vous conseillerais de vous faire suivre par un gynécologue car pour prendre rdv pour 1 échograhie son secrétariat peu le faire por vous lors de la consultation si il exerce dans la clinique où vous souhaitez accoucher ou si vous avez un problème de tension pour les monitoring c'est plus facile pour lui de venir vous voir et de vérrifier que tout va bien.|`|k3WyfYQbaa	En debut de grossesse un generaliste peut tt à fait s'occuper de toi. Seulement tu devras prendre RDV dans un centre d'echographie pour la 1ere echo que tu vas devoir bientot faire ( si elle n'est pas deja faite ) ainsi que pour la 2eme.<br>  <br>  Vers 6 mois de grossesse tu devras t'inscrire dans une maternité ou tu seras suivis tt les mois par une sage femme.<br>  <br>  Perso je me suis inscrite à 4 mois de grossesse dans la maternité ou j'ai souhaiter accouché j'ai donc etait suivi par la meme sage femme tte ma grossesse.<br>  <br>  Felicitation pour ce bébé à venir ;)|`|6f2bbf438eea815b7e2c462fbd1eb2d1aa	ton médecin traitant peut suivre ta grossesse si tu n'as pas de problème particulier. ?à c'est pour le suivi mensuel. Ensuite, la maternité où tu seras inscrite pour accoucher te dira quels autres examens il faut faire (échos, consults avec une sage femme...).<br>  Si tu n'as encore consulté personne dépêche toi un peu, il y a la déclaration de grossesse à faire, des examens sanguins (toxo, rubéole, VIH, groupe sanguin, glycémie...)! Il ne faut pas trop tarder non plus pour t'inscrire dans une maternité, si tu attends trop tu risques selon la région où tu te trouves de ne pas avoir de place (c'est arrivé à l'une de mes amies, elle a tardé pour les démarches, le jour de l'accouchement elle est allée aux urgences du CHU...pas top...enfin, sa fille est magnifique!)<br>  Bonne grossesse!|`|KD6p4Ljwaa	C'est quand même mieux, c'est un spécialiste. Si tu ne veut pas de gynéco, vas au moins voir une sage femme. DE toute fa?on c'est obligatoire  du 6 au 9ème mois.

De toute fa?on, ton génèraliste ne te fera pas les échos. |`|NAMjLgWAaa	oui ton medecin generaliste peut tout a fait te suivre mais tu devra kan meme avoir d consultatin avec un gygy et de meme pr les 3 echo obligatoire!! je suis enceinte de 25SA et je suis suivi kom sa!! bon courage bise|`|9U6taEReaa	en effet tu devrais consulter un gyneco c est sa spécialité et il sera plus amene a te répondre par rapport a ton généraliste|`|CXCXSaUaaa	un gynéco c'est mieux, il connait bien son boulot.|`|j8tMJCV9aa	le probleme est ke si tu as un probleme, le généraliste risk de passer à coté ! idem pour une sage femme.<br>  <br>  Chacun ses spécialités !
AA12205301	It is only true if your mother agrees to do it.  Child support is not for the child to use it as they wish.  It is to support the child, food, housing, clothes, etc.  She has been doing this all these years, without the help from your father. He has no right to say that you will get the money.  It is her money, she supported you.  You shouldn't even feel free to ask her for it. A lot of people believe it should go to the child to use as they want to.  That is not the case and you won't know that until you are in the situation of having to raise a child without the support. It is hard to do it financially, which makes it hard to do emotionally because you are always worried about the bills and how to feed and take care of the child.  The other person gets off free by not paying the support, while the one raising the child is worried and stressed out and sometimes that effects the way the parent is for the child.  The parent has to work hard, take care of everything and is tired and therefore has a harder time being there completely for the child.  It is a hard thing.  Your mother went through this, don't even presume that the money is owed to you.  Don't even go there!!!! It is hers. |`|RvddYKqjaa	The money is your mom's, to be used in your support. That's not to say it can't furnish clothing, but it would seem that some of it may be putting you through college. Child support money is seldom, if ever paid to the child. Just picture that!  Once you are 18, you should be on your own, but it could be that provisions have been made to help you through school. If I were you I'd leave it as it is, unless you plan to get a job and totally support yourself. You are doing pretty well. I hope you manage to get an education.  |`|MRD8bKmIaa	once ur 18 ur parents dont have 2. they can do what ever they want and its ur job to privide for urself b/c u are an adult. once ur 18 that means ur old enough to pay child support yourself|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	Not in Nebraska.  The child support goes thru the state and the state issues the checks to the custodial parent.  As for that being back child support, she's right.  She spent BIG bucks raising you, electricity, a place to live, food, clothing ect, and so that money should go to her.  It's money she should have had to help pay for all those things when you were under her care, and she's just getting it late.   And you shouldn't be expecting your father or you mother to be providing for your needs now that you are grown.  You're going to have to get a job to buy clothes and food and the likes for yourself.  |`|XPnCeJ29aa	I have seen on the court shows (LOL), that the mother was owed back child support, the father never payed..and by that time the child was an adult (18), and yes the money did go to the daughter.<br>  <br>  But Im sure this depends on each state, and orders.|`|DvWGTzLUaa	Its money your father owes your mother, so it should go directly to her to pay her back for all the stuff she bought for you over the years... As someone else said, its time to take responsability and get a job and pay your own way.|`|7abO79braa	It depends where you live and what the court orders were.<br>  Some ppl have to keep paying until the child is finished college.<br>  Find out maybe through a Legal Aid Association.|`|IV6bH9puaa	i am in the same boat i am 20.my mom has to pay the back child support.it cant be sent directly to you because it is not for you at this age it is to help your mother out for all those years that she didnt have no help.this is what i did i just sat down with my dad and told him i know that you are getting the back child support and that it is helping pay you back for the years you didnt have any help but is there any way that you can give me any of it to help me with college and i am sure your mom will just hand you all the money if not all then ask her if you could half it with her.if she has a heart then she will do this.it is what my dad does for me.hope this helps you.have a wonderful day.|`|uRImc3Qnaa	No, unfortunately it is going to be sent to your caregiver, and if there is back pay that will have to be paid of before any new payments are made.  <br>  <br>  Sorry your going through this it is tough, parents are so bitter about who paid for what and for how long sometimes the kid, you, get lost in it, they are sour about all the things they did without all the debts they already paid and they think the money is theirs, because they already took care of you.  Most child support stops at 18 you would have to see the court documents.  Some papers state mom or dad have to help with college some don't address it.  <br>  <br>  As a parent, kids cost a lot of money and for all the years dear old dad didn't help out with you it put a lot of stress and strain on mom, my friend is going through this and is angry because he stopped paying child support for his kid and she is tough on the little girl because she is half dad too.   Kids in this are stuck because of the parents not figuring out how to work the money out and leave the love in.<br>  <br>  Grow up and get away from them you deserve better!  Mom and Dad need to do a lot of growing up too, but my guess is they will always be grossly out of order.|`|flqAr30laa	Basically its reimbursement for mom for the time when the dad did not pay support.<br>  So, its mom's money.|`|AA12080472	if its back pay, it goes to your mother.   its time to get a work study job
wDtyFC5Caa	When In was 35 my son was 7. So I think it is too late!|`|BttalmMqaa	Late but not too late|`|w1UDuUMKaa	If that is when you feel comfortable then it is a perfect age. Our bodys stop being able to concieve at a certain age because thats when we're not meant to. So obviously if you can concieve its not too late. People say mine was too early as I was 17 but I felt ready and I am doing great. Goodluck.|`|fb61d99b32eb382445becee914185af9aa	huh?  Never is too late if your doc clears you medically.  But much past that age and I think there are health risks for your baby, like risks of down syndrome, etc.  But many women have lovely healthy babies in their 40s, you just have to take more care and your doctor will monitor you more carefully etc.|`|1uBFvfSbaa	As long as you have no major medical issues it's absolutely not too late!!|`|su4WMCMDaa	not really because you are still active at 45 and can still run around maybe not as much as someone who is 35 (being when the child is 10) if your in good health i say go for it |`|FRaOgPsHaa	its allright, my mom had me when she was 35 ;)|`|BPE2ugzlaa	Nowadays its totally common. People at like 40 are having kids now. So its definitely not too old. The only thing I see wrong with it and its only for some people is that the older you are the harder it is for some people to play around with their kids a lot. You know what I mean? But again nowadays woman are staying younger longer for some reason. So nope no problem. <br>  P.S. Congratulations!|`|AA10427045	35 is actually the deadline, we just had this huge discussion in my Biology class about that, stack up on your prenatal vitamins though, i mean stack up!

It's kinda common, actually.<br>  The BEST time to have a baby is before age 26. It's best for the woman's body and the health of the baby, too.<br>  But I don't see any problems with having a first baby at 35.|`|QM6wiVtVaa	No. I wouldn't do it, but many women do, and are great mothers.|`|Ujxrpoonaa	No... are you kidding? 35 is not too late at all.|`|4vsGpGecaa	NO I don't think it's too late. I have 3 kids and I plan on having my last kid around 35. I am 22 and obviously was not ready for kids. I think by 35 I should be emotionally, financially ready and my kids should be in high school/graduating and hopefully moving out when they do so.

You rotate them every few days or week so they get equal wear and tear and then if one ever gets lost you still have a backup.  There are few greater panics than thinking you've lost the only thing your kid wants to fall asleep with (and you don't want to have to resort to ebay, replacement loveys cost a fortune once they're out of production).<br>  <br>  Congrats on everyone sleeping better.<br>  <br>  Stories about lost loveys:<br>  <a href="http://www.momstoday.com/articles/baby-bonds/when-lovey-is-lost-4763/" rel="nofollow">http://www.momstoday.com/articles/baby-b...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22491129/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/22491129/</a><br>  <a href="http://plushsearch.dirtybutter.com/" rel="nofollow">http://plushsearch.dirtybutter.com/</a>|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	Yes, it's awesome.

I've spent many hours looking for pooh bear and bunny before my son could go to sleep!  His security when he was a baby was a blankie.  He would rub one corner of it on the bottom of his nose.

4iXL4C6paa	I always started early, (I just couldn't help myself), and usually you can catch good sales, like if you are do next summer, they are usually having sales on summer clothes now. congrats|`|W6GJT0TKaa	I started buying by then, I would think if you are not high risk and your Dr hasnt said anything to that affect, that you would be fine buying things now.  I dont know, Im thinking this may be your first.  So here are some tips, dont waste money on newborn things, start out with 0-3 month and get 6-8 and maybe even 6-9 month.  They grow fast and that way you have things on hand.  Same goes with diapers!<br>  Good Luck and congrats|`|Ujxrpoonaa	Start whenever you'd like. I started about 2 months BEFORE I even got pregnant. And why are you concerned about losing your baby? As long as everything in your pregnancy are normal than the chance is low. Chances are always highest in your first trimester. Good luck and congrats!|`|EatvN0RUaa	I started shopping when i was 16 weeks! I would go for it because i got a lot of good deals and in February i got my son clothes for this year! Now my son is almost 9 months! It worked out great for us!|`|59fcd325f0dcf47b63e3ed62aeaf2be1aa	I started after my first trimester and soooo glad I did! It adds up fast and the sooner you start picking things up the better. My hubby and I bought one big thing a month. Good luck!!! |`|AA11465739	I'm sure everything will be fine.

1WFIEh2waa	IT'S JUST FROM ALL THE PROTEINS AND NUTRIENTS IN YOUR MILK...NOT 2 WORRY!|`|d8eRfVYNaa	I was wondering the same thing! My little girl, a few days ago, gave me a stool just like that and I breast feed and bottle feed at the same time too~ I'm thinking it could be the mixture of the too because stools from breast feed babies are yellow and very watery and formula stools are supposed to be almost white or tan and kind of thick paste ~ So I suppose the result is the green mixture we are getting! I'm going to consult an expert about it anyway just to be sure^_^|`|VVpolZXcaa	hmm... is it COMPETLY green? or just sorta is it kinda watery or watery? (kinda watery is normal for babies)|`|Ujxrpoonaa	kind of watery or watery? Watery green poop is diarrhea|`|tb27BE8Uaa	its very normal, but can also be a sign of diarrhea. if you are breast feeding, keep in mind whatever you consume the baby is getting it  from the milk.|`|AA11334468	absolutely normal  wait til 3 months when the poop breaks thorogh the sides of the diaper|`|1xaKovK2aa	Absolutely normal!<br>  <br>  I-Like-C said "wait til 3 months and it comes out the sides"  I say, if it only comes out the sides you are lucky.  Wait until you've got the kid sitting up and the poop defies gravity and ends up his/her back and onto the neck.  Usually hapends when your in a hurry and not in convenient place to change this type of mess.  <br>  Isn't parenting fun????
XmJZkFuMaa	For a newborn, the hospitals keep the temperature between 72 and 78 Fahrenheit.  We found our daughter liked it between 72-74.  What we did was get a small heater that would turn off if it tipped over and was safety tested and from a reputable company.  It had an internal thermometer, so it turns on when it drops below 72 degrees and turns back off once it hits 73.  We made sure it was away from her bed, blocked all the windows with the house-plastic stuff to help keep the room warm, closed the door, and threw our covers off (because to us it was too warm.)  The heater would only turn on a few times, but she slept much better that way.<br>  <br>  And that was WITH her swaddle.  <br>  <br>  So yeah.  72-74 degrees.<br>  <br>  Add:  During the day I didn't worry about it.  If I was comfortable in a shirt and pants, then she was comfortable in her under-onesie and outer-pant-suit.  I always did 2 layers, and if she got cold, then another layer.  We did try to keep the house at 68-70 in the daytime.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	65 to 75 degrees is fine.  The rule of thumb is ithat it should be comfy for a lightly dressed adult.  It's better for baby to be cool then to be warm.  Especially when sleeping.  The temp in my house changes constantly because we live in Nebraska and most of the windows are on the West side of teh house.  We may have teh heat on at night and the air on during the day.  I try to keep my son in light clothing indoors though.|`|IXBl5l5kaa	We have a town home and the temperature can be wacky with the thermostat downstairs. Currently we turn it to around 74/75 at night and around 72/73 during the day. |`|yc6FdSLbaa	Babies like warm temperature.  I would say between 75 and 78.  Don't go any hotter than that, or your little baby will get too hot!|`|cqgWkdPtaa	23 or 24 degrees celsuis is the most economic and best temp for everyone|`|QzOCkKGjaa	78|`|1dEnKWcIaa	So far we have kept our house at 72 degrees F for our 2 month old.

pI5EAAUcaa	When I was in grade school in the early 70's, I watched shows like Captain Kangaroo, Cowboy Bob's Corral and the Janie Show before I went to school. Usually it was if I was ready for school and waiting for it to be time to leave. <br>  My kids will sometimes watch a little bit while getting dressed if they're in my  bedroom. They don't have much time to watch it though, 15 to 30 min tops. Usually they'll watch something on Disney or Noggin. Noggin IS educational TV. <br>  And my youngest who is in Kindergarten, she watches PBS in her classroom the first 30 min of class. Educational programming on that channel.  <br>  I don't think watching a little TV is harmful in the morning, providing it's educational and doesn't cause them to dawdle about getting ready for school. If they dawdle and are late for school, then yeah turn it off or say only after you're dressed, fed and ready you can watch til it's time to leave. <br>  Even I watch at least 10 or 15 min of news while I'm getting dressed or making their lunches. <br>  I should also add that when my 20yr old was a senior in high school, I had 4 out of 5 kids in school at that time and that year, ALL 4 kids had straight A's. I don't think TV has anything to do with rotting brains if you use it wisely. And I have an 8yr old son and he's made straight A's every year since he's been in school and this year, 3rd grade, they've put him in a gifted class.|`|OxFsslN8aa	My children watch a 1/2 hour of television every morning before getting ready for school.  It helps their brains to fully wake up and they do what is required with little or no complaining.  I can't wake up and eat breakfast right away and so I don't expect it from my children.  I don't think watching TV is a problem - perhaps what they are watching could be the issue.  |`|AA11109728	My daughter watches a little tv in the morning.  As long as she gets ready for school and the tv isn't in the way of that, I'm fine.  But different people have different opinions on it.  You and your friend can disagree on it - it doesn't mean one of you is right and one of you is wrong.  It just means you parent differently, and there's nothing wrong with it.  What would be wrong, is for you to push your beliefs on your friend and criticize them for the way they do things.  If you're not doing that, leave it that way and agree to disagree!|`|nfzQkvqraa	You're probably right, but as a busy mom who likes to keep her sanity, my children watch tv while they get ready for school.   So far good grades and behavior are all we've had from them, and they love school.  Unless that changes, I'm not going to change our routine.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I think it is unnecessary as the focus should be on having breakfast and getting prepared for school.

I think the problem is that school is boring and I certainly don't think it stunts kid's imaginations.  This whole idea about TV being bad is total nonsense and I really don't know where it came from.<br>  I loved the TV as a kid and still like good shows like Heroes, Dexter, Dr Who and stuff now.<br>  I'm 28, I've got an MA in English literature.  I just thought I'd tell you that in case you thought I was some sort of illiterate teenager.|`|tOVgiGn1aa	It's not bad, but can she keep in as half an hour if the child is watching a program that is just started. Won't she have problems to have it swiched off to send the child to school?<br>  Although it's not bad she should be aware of the pressure that can arise when it's time to swich off. Tell your friend not to put too much weight on her shoulders and create a negative answer from the child. You're right about overstimulating the childs mind and will keep the child wanting to come home fast to watch more and cutting the relations with other children and not revising at home after school, and in the long run will possibly jeoperdise their grades to a certain degree. She should just keep an eye on the child's performance and act accordingly.|`|4gZYucHMaa	No I don't think that way at all. You're the only one. You don't have kids so I'm not sure what business it is of yours anyways.<br>  <br>  I remember doing the same thing as a kid and as long as they've done everything required such as made bed, ate breakfast I don't have a problem with my child relaxing.<br>  <br>  Do you not relax?? Kids need a chill time and what works for you doesn't work for others.<br>  <br>  edit---lol you think I was rude haha! You need to grow thicker skin on that skull avatar if you're throwing out self-rightous attitudes like you do to things you know nothing about it.|`|Qas05nZraa	The child may be late for class if he watches TV before going to school and they may not concentrate on the lesson, they'll think about the show they watched|`|r07BwhO1aa	I let my daughter watch a little TV in the morning, normally it is news which is what I like to watch, it keeps her informed about the world.<br>  <br>  As with anything in life an excess of anything is bad.  TV is actually a way to relax their minds are so over-stimulated by school and the pressure to succeed some TV helps them to unwind.  |`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Actually, I do not believe 30 minutes of TV in the morning is harming anyone.  My kids wake up over an hour before we leave for school and I like for them to wake gradually, part of this is letting them watch tv while eating breakfast.  In the afternoons sometimes we are so busy running around from activity to activity, homework and baths that the kids have very little "down" time.  Sometimes it's good to let their brains go on autopilot for a little while so that they can focus when they need to.<br>  <br>  Don't you need some downtime to recharge your batteries?|`|d5a52bb19a9fa6747be1ee4084979a27aa	I don't think tv harms kids. My girls watch about half an hour in the mornings they have to be washed, dressed and had their breakfast before we switch it on.<br>  I think it's down to the child how it effects them. My eldest is at school and she doesn't find school boring she is top of the class and enjoys going to school. Tv can be educational, this morning they watched news-round which is very informative.|`|f0otK4zQaa	not at all

If you are so worried about it then, maybe wait a couple days and take a test, and if your still not satisfied with the results, then wait 2 more days and test again! Good Luck!|`|AA11985760	Some women get what's called implantation bleeding and mistake it for their period.<br>  The only way to be sure is to take a pregnancy test.

A few of my friends had their periods throughout their pregnancy. <br>  The only way to be sure is a pregnancy test.<br>  You also  might want to get checked out by your doctor. There are a few medical conditions that can cause you to have frequent and irregular periods, and you might want to see a doctor just to be sure.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|107168c907dfd36e5d5a2f486b2e7b23aa	yes you can still have ur period while u r pregant you can still get it until ur baby is born go to the doctor and check urself out to see what is wrong with ur body|`|170428047997338e69befa6cc61a520eaa	First why do you think your 6 weeks?

You could have caught Hepatitis C, which also can be transmitted through sexual contact.  It makes you feel as if you have the flu.  If you're lucky, it will be an acute case and not a chronic case, but in ANY case, you should tell your doctor to run some blood tests on you.<br>  <br>  Please, use protection next time!

d2646bea9f8735ed26935186d4d3a04caa	They say that babies sleep more when the mom is walking around.  It's just like when they're out of the womb, if you rock her, she will sleep.  Same idea when she's inside the womb.  When you're resting, she's up and running...!<br>  <br>  And the reason you're feeling the kicks on the surface more now, is because she's getting bigger, and you can actually feel her kick.  Before you were feeling her rolling around, or moving side to side, now she's really kicking you.  And, eventually she will get so big that you won't feel the kicks as much, but you will feel things like her moving onto her side, or closing and opening her legs.<br>  <br>  It's all part of the great process!<br>  <br>  www.sanemommy.com|`|66fd836a3d058137180fe46e711e23f9aa	As long as you are expiriencing some sort of movement you can relax.

I have never had them grow the way they did when I was using prenatals.  Some women take them just to make their hair or nails grow.  I'd say it does work, with all those vitamins and minerals that are in them, we probably wouldn't  get them unless we are taking prenatals.|`|pXS4GUTQaa	Not in my case.|`|4ErxJuAvaa	yes my hair and nails grew uncontrollably|`|ik39pdzWaa	yes. not only that but it grows in thicker and your nails get stronger, therefore, longer too. once you stop the prenatals, you'll start shedding like a dog in springtime.  it will go back to the same thickness it was before the vitamins. you won't lose ALL your hair, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  while i'm thinking of it, i was told NOT to color or perm my hair while pregnant, as it might hurt the baby. so i didn't. the outgrowth looked terrible but the twins were born healthy.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	well i didnt take em but bein pregnant made my hair grow faster|`|AA10911224	I was pregnant & started taking them. I noticed a difference in my hair & nails for sure, so I am still taking them now. My once brittle nails are now long & thick. I've gotten lots of compliments on them. Also, people have complimented about how shiny my hair is. It's already really long so it's hard to tell if it's made a difference it that aspect, but overall I think the prenatal vitamins work & I'm planning to keep taking them.
E7trCwHOaa	I was never told I needed to know everything before having a child.  But I did read, and read and read and read, all during my pregnancy to get as much information as I could.  And you know what?  Maybe 10% of that turned out to be useful.  Everything else I learned the hard way, by trial and error.  <br>  <br>  Also, those books never talk about the best lessons you learn from parenthood, the ones that shape the kind of parent you will be.  My daughter has taught me so much about myself and the world I'm a part of, just by existing.  Parenting is one of life's greatest lessons, and a blessing.|`|137ec00c379d38513b34df7a6d8fdad8aa	Mostly I have realized that only someone who has had children can give me advice, and even then you have to take everything they say with a grain of salt or two.  <br>  The bottom line is this... once you become a parent there is no turning back.  No amount of books and research will prepare you for the days ahead.  Make sure that you take the time to relax and be the parent that you want to be, not some pre-described ideal of what Celebrities are spewing at you.  And even people who have 7 children find that with every new child comes a new set of worries, concerns and absolute joys.<br>  Take Care! <br>  :o)|`|170197f194646db24bc092b02a938496aa	I am a mother of 9 year old twins..... and still have a lot to learn. Life is a journey, wisdom is something you gain everyday of your life......there is no way to know" it all" before you kids are born.<br>  There is no way to know "it all" ever. Until you have children, there is no way you are ever really prepared for what kids entail.<br>  Love them, learn from them, grow together......All will be fine!|`|5egXe6jVaa	I feel most of the stuff came naturally. My daughter is even disabled no one thaught me how to take care of her before hand.

The fact is - you grow with your children. Just remember the basic tenets which I guess are the only things any boook can guide you on:<br>  1. patience<br>  2. do not compare them to others<br>  3. listen, listen, listen<br>  4. make time for them<br>  5. do silly things with them<br>  6. enjoy them<br>  7. remember you are making memories for them!!!!!!!!!<br>  8. give them lots of love & hugs<br>  9. each one may need to be disciplined differently<br>  10. you will have your own child rearing technique<br>  11. you must still find time for YOU so that you do not snap when you are with them!<br>  12. if there is a significant other find time for u both as well!|`|abf01838f7f56e56f12a1a1b38b3eab9aa	Exactly, you can read all you want but on the job training is the best way to learn,specially with the first one,and because each child is different you get to learn so much.|`|PqA6j6uIaa	I believe that you do attain a greater level of understanding and knowledge about how to raise children - especially your children (as they are all different) - as you are doing it.    However, I did find books helpful (The "what to expect" series)  in the beginning as a framework and also as developmental markers.  I find some of the magazines (Parents) and websites useful as well because you can learn from other parents.  You'll get alot of advice from just about everyone with a mouth, and all the books and mags will tell you what you should do as well.  I always took the approach to be reasonably informed and then trust my own judgement.  Whatever I do I make sure my wife and I are on same page.|`|jgpkwec5aa	I agree. Personally, I think you do have to live and learn! There are some things that you can and need to research, like infant carseat before the baby arrives. But there are also going to be things that you never even thought of that will arise later in the child's life. It doesn't make u a bad parent for not thinking of it before hand. It is just life.|`|uIx1K75Taa	before i had my daughter i  read all the books i could it prepared my for alot of it but there is nothing like first hand experience every child is different if you tried to know everything before hand you will be in for alot of surprises|`|AA11974580	True, all the books in the world can't tell you how to parent your child.  Each child is individual with their own needs and parents develop their own parenting style while getting to know their own child. <br>  It is good to have plenty of books with advise, but when it comes right down to it, parents know their child best.  <br>  I read so many books before my first child, but nothing could prepare me for what was ahead of me ~ just as nobody could explain to me what it's like to love my child the way I do.<br>  Nobody understands what it's like until they've been there. <br>  I learned alot with each of my 4 kids and still don't know everything there is to know about being a parent. <br>  It's best to realise that we're human and as long as we have the best of intentions then we'll be just fine parents no matter how well prepared we might think we are.|`|jvW3a5GYaa	I agree with you - parenting is more of an on the job training kind of thing.|`|AA12057101	I agree. people can tell you how hard it is or what not, but until you experience it your self, You will never know. I agree 100%|`|AA12196402	i'm not a parent, so technically,i should totally ignore this question.but, what you said was so true.to me, you can't understand anything or anyone completely,until you've been through some of the things they've been through.|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	I agree.....you can get all the adivice and read all the books you want, but you really have no idea what you are getting into until your there.....and each kid is different, so not one method of parenting will work for every kid.....even in the same family....It like driving a car....you might have read how, but you really don't know until your there.....what is really funny is I will bet half of the people who wrote those books have never really raised kids....they have had nanny or just studied kids in day care or somehting.....|`|uLjpvfrbaa	I'm with you, babe!  I read all the books and did all the reading and then I had REAL babies and all those books ended up buried in the bookshelves.  You end up being able to write a book yourself.  Plus, I think the people who wrote those books either never had kids themselves (and just studied other kids like guinea pigs) or else they had "easy" kids and thought they could claim the credit.  Well, I have 2 boys and most of what I know about parenting I learned on the job.  Books are great when you have a newborn with a fever but Grandma and other mommies are a much better resource.
LGNyapa1aa	yes that is 100% true.<br>  if you have sex, make sure man is on top and have a pillow under you, when he c**s then lift your legs up and it's recommended you stay in that position for at least 20 mins but i usually do that then fall asleep without letting the sperm come out til the morning (sorry that's a bit gross!)<br>  <br>  just check any website and it will tell you that - go to google and put in "the best way to conceive" and it will tell you to do this! good luck!|`|0K1OSeOkaa	Women on top does NOT help with conception.  GRAVITIY PULLS PEOPLE.  If the women is on top, the sperm are fighting a losing battle because gravity is strong enough to hold us down, what do you think it does to them???  the best way is to have sex missionary style, so that there is the least effect of gravity pull, and put a pillow under your butt when your done.  Just a small one.  This tilts your pelvis a little helping them along, but it doesnt make them faster, it just fights gravity.  Read TAKING CHARGE OF YOUR FERTILITY.  It tellsyou everything you need ot know.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	no sperm has a tail on it and they no where to go and u holding up ur legs will not help ur eggs are in ur ovaries with are in ur abdominal area not ur legs|`|XZWkQMH6aa	if youre trying to get pregnant<br>  the best and easier ways would be<br>  to be on top, because it has a faster and better chance than any other possition.<br>  <br>  And after you "do it" just lay still for a while.|`|oltCj6Kcaa	Supposedly putting a pillow or something under your hips to elevate them helps the sperm get to the egg.

I didn't have them the first time around but this pregnancy I am getting them quite often due to the heat causing dehydration and my habit to stay up too late. They are caused alot of the time by lack of sleep and dehydration.|`|114a9e7f24177ba552a0e5c76a745e27aa	BH contractions are usually painless practice or warm up contractions. Basically you'll noticed your belly tighten up for a few seconds. Sometimes you may have a dull ache or cramp with it too and feel it in your back as well. With my first pregnancy I started feeling them around 7 months with my next two pregnacys I felt them earlier. They usually arent too bothersome.|`|4xTDmLjHaa	BH contractions are practice contractions. Your uterus usually starts doing this around 25 weeks in your first pregnancy.<br>  They are usually painless (though as you come closer to your due date, they can get uncomfortable), and are irregular in both duration and intensity.<br>  It just feels like a tightening in your stomach.|`|R8NoqpH3aa	they are usually called False labor or some call it practice labor. Basically ur uterus just practicing for when it really has to do it's job. It's normal.. Some women feel it from as early as 12 weeks up untill they have the real contractions. I just had them about 2 weeks ago and im 29 weeks now. It felt like menstrual cramps or light contracting. But most women will tell  you that you will know when the real ones hit!!|`|lmVW75z4aa	it happens when you're still pregnant, it's when your body is "practicing" for real contractions but don't be alarmed.  I never noticed but my dr said to pay attention to my breathing patterns and when it feels like you almost gasp for air like similar to as if  you climbed a few steps and needed air then that's braxton hicks, i don't think I started getting them until later in pregnancy like 7-9 months. Also you wil feel as if your uterus is contracting like shrinking and then getting big again and may have slight cramping|`|vXXDzBaKaa	bh contractions are false labor contractions. they make ur uterus tighten up but they are usually painless (although annoying) and the are irregular but they do aid in getting ur body ready for birth|`|93CwBXOaaa	They feel like mild to really bad cramps. I think I was like 6 1/2 or 7 months. (My youngest just turned 7). It lasts for a few seconds to a minute or so then repeats. It may do it for 15-20 minutes at a time. It may be a few hours. Get somewhere and relax if at all possible until they subside. Warm baths help too. It is just your pelvic muscles preparing themselves for contractions. Braxton hicks will last all the way up until you deliver. When the real contractions kick it, you'll know it.<br>  Best wishes!

Fammi un cenno, ti aspetto!|`|xtJesuCFaa	Puoi sempre abortire, nessuno te lo vieta soprattutto data la tua giovane età. Sei ancora una bimba, come pensi di poter educare il tuo di bimbo? Pensaci...|`|0scTfmtiaa	Stai tranquilla e serena, non ti agitare.<br>  Sarà dura e difficile in quanto giovanissima (dove abito io in Norvegia sono più aperti e ti danno tante sovvenzioni e non 6 considerata male)...giù da noi in Italia non sarai ben vista ma non ci credo che tua madre non voglia aiutarti per 2 semplici motivi.<br>  1) sei sua figlia, pertanto tua madre ti aiuterà sicuramente e farà in modo che tu vada a scuola perchè ti vuole bene e pensa al tuo futuro.<br>  2) appena tuo figlio/a ci sarà tua madre sballerà dietro l'idea di avere un nipote e quindi ti aiuterà.<br>  Ci vuole solo un pò di tempo perchè venga assimilata l'idea.<br>  <br>  Mia madre mi ha avuto a 18 anni, non era così giovane ma era sempre una ragazza ed entrambi i genitori (i miei nonni) erano morti. Era nella merda, ma con la volontà si ottiene tutto pertanto se tu vuoi avere il bambino tienilo, perchè te ne pentiresti dopo.<br>  Ti dò un consiglio spassionato comunque...ci sono in ogni comune dei consultori con psicologi, assistenti sociali, consulenti ecc. prendi un appuntamento e chiedi un consiglio a loro non che loro ti dicano cosa tu debba o non debba fare ma ti aiutano a ragionare (magari adesso sarai un pò confusa) e gli assistenti sociali ti possono dare un grande aiuto.

a2597c46ddff47ff43c9c7ca0f8d84eaaa	First of all if you are four months late, then you should make an appt with your ob/gyn to get tested to see if you are already pregnant. If not, then they can give you a pill to take for 7 days to make you start your period.  Secondly, you have to ovulate to become pregnant (ovulation is when your ovaries release your eggs).  However, just because you have a period doesn't mean you ovulate.  I would see my doctor ~ if you are not already pregnant then something else is going on with you being four months late.|`|AA11981363	the fact that you are not getting your period doesn't mean that you are not ovulating....and yes, you need to ovulate in order to get pg.

Eventually i went to a doc who told me i could possibly have PCOS and sent me off to have an ultrasound. I was so worried they would find cancer. Instead they found a 6week embryeo with everything looking normal and healthy. I was shocked because i hadnt had a period in like 3-4 months and didnt realise i could fall preg without having a period.

That would be taking a big risk.|`|AA10551683	There's no reason to get worked up over having a few glasses of wine, it can't change anything now!  Stop drinking until after you give birth, and carry on with healthy habits while you're pregnant.  There's no real way to tell how much alcohol will harm a baby, so the rule of thumb is not to drink at all.|`|AA11108351	With that little bit of alcohol, I wouldn't stress about it. My doctor even told me that one glass every few days was okay. If I were you though, I wouldn't have any more. My doctor told me that only women who have a serious drinking problem are the ones who should worry about FAS. If you have any questions though, I'd talk to your doc.
44bb698bd0f724c1bd29f672591fd44caa	Food Adversions are normal in pregnancy in the first trimester the most! Things I used to love disgust me to look at right now.

Your nearly finished your first trimester and its common for certain symptoms to dissapear, my morning sickness and adversion to certain foods went away at 9 weeks and that made me freak out too. Now nothing really makes me sick anymore and i feel good, but beware now that your entering your 2nd trimester other things start to show! back ache, intense emotions, sleeping discomfort etc..  enjoy your pregnancy, im sure you baby is just fine.   good luck.|`|AA10428131	No its Normal things happen during pregnancy  some tims u wanna eat sometimes u dont ur Not to far aong in ur pregancy so dont be worried|`|AA11923303	I was the same way when I was pregnant.

However I have read elsewhere that you cant, but how can you change how you sleep? Dont stress over it. They can hear loud noises, I was reading on a website that it will be kind of used to the dog barking or the vaccume cleaner or loud noises like that. Haha mine will be singing along to the beatles! and you can rub your stomach to get the baby to move ,so i would suppose so!|`|63e61e5d2ed34a992aa7035a2fba9d45aa	I'm not sure whether the baby can actually feel you rub your tummy or not. I know that when I was farther along with my daughter I could push on her legs/arms/head/butt when she was causing me discomfort. They can feel that. I'm just not sure whether rubbing your belly at 5 months(I'm 5 months along, too) the baby can feel anything or not, because you can't see them move only feel them. <br>  <br>  As for hearing, they can hear you and other sounds around you. The baby will even respond to loud noises. Now is a good time to start talking/reading to your baby. Have dad, grandma, grandpa, and anyone else important in your life talk to your baby, too. When the baby is born they will recognize the voices of those who they hear the most. <br>  <br>  You should fall asleep on your side, preferably your left side. If you wake up on your back it's ok. You are most likely waking up because of the strain of not sleeping on your side. You'll be fine as long as you fall asleep in the correct position. It's the same thing when your baby gets old enough to turn over on their own. You always put them to sleep on their back, but if they wake up on their belly it's ok because they are strong enough to turn over.|`|66fd836a3d058137180fe46e711e23f9aa	Yes my midwife was listening to my boys heart beat and we could hear him kicking at the doppler! it sounded like little thumps.. She would find the heart beat and then it would go away as he rolled over.  Then when i had my 18 week ultrasound the baby kept rolling away from the sensor on my tummy.. Also if i poke (gently) at my tummy i feel kicks about 10-15 seconds later!!!   and yes baby can hear voices and will recognise them at birth (mum & dads)...|`|dab391535c3cca2e58914658b7393ff0aa	the Pregnancy bible says that at around 24 or 25 weeks than can be responsive to touch, i don't know if its just rubbing or poking, I'm over weight so i don't know if that is why mine isn't very responsive.<br>  <br>  They can hear more than just the mothers voice! The book says they can actually hear men's voices better because they are deep.  Eventually your baby will be able to hear more sounds around you too like loud music and may respond to it.
66fd836a3d058137180fe46e711e23f9aa	If docs are trying to determine pregnancy they will measure a hormone called HCG.

aadbc672ff509652b97f6931f5913dbaaa	How long ago did you have your baby? If bub is still under 1yr, you can only do very gentle exercise for your stomach.<br>  Practice this: Draw your belly button in toward your spine, as though you are doing up a tight pair of jeans. Hold your tummy in, but continue to breath in and out. At first it will be hard to jold your stomach in as the muscles are weak, but it will become easier as you increase strength. Buy one of those big fit balls, and sit on that when watching TV, they are great for developing core strength.|`|b386da38a87749db136f6369473696a0aa	Breastfeeding helps lose the baby weight|`|618ba1ddef5defd7d8cdc8008c75ac03aa	Check out this web site it has all the information you need :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Post_natal_exercise_sample_workout?Open" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2...</a><br>  <br>  good luck|`|a82fa58548da1c4f554d9a7744117a65aa	walking,  take deep breathe and then leave it. do this 25 times ,dieting . no oily food,|`|ab463895db60022b884c08c3412bb350aa	walking is great, its gentle, it will relax and give u a break from ur baby duties.if u take baby along- she ll enjoy fresh air as well.<br>  for me swimming worked wonders. now i m trying the elliptical machine (15 min)and 100 crunches  a day. i m now back to my pre pregnancy size.<br>  it is a slow process, combination of diet and exercise.<br>  please do not lessen ur food for fear of being fat if u re breast feeding still - i ve seen it affect milk supply.<br>  tummy will go down as ur baby grows old and makes u run around.<br>  enjoy ur baby- she s worth the tummy gain :)|`|f69002c1e8e34ebfb50bfe39e749074eaa	breastfeeding does help, but also just do situps or crunches. you can also ask your doctor.

CZox7ppYaa	since u were not on the shot for very long then i would say that u have a better chance of getting pregnant sooner then most people.... i was on the shot for 5 years and have since been off for about 13 months.... we have been ttc since then woth no luck..... some doctors say that the shot is the worst kind of birth control.... because it messes up a womans body so bad..... i have never had normal periods by any means.... i have always been a heavy bleeder and have always had irregular periods..... i would say that there is a pretty high possibility that u could be pregnant.... take a home pregnancy test for now..... if u r still feeling the symptoms then i would take a blood test to confirm.... good luck i hope u get what u r looking for!!!|`|AA11623677	Well, I stopped the shot and with in 2 weeks later I was pregnant!!  So it can happen.   It does sound like you are pregnant, but it might just be the side effects from the shot.  I would deffentaly make an appointment with your OB though.  Good Luck =)<br>  <br>  I looked up some side effects of the Depo for ya...<br>  Many young women who receive the birth control shot will notice a change in their periods. Other possible side effects include:<br>  <br>  irregular or no menstrual periods <br>  weight gain, headaches, and breast tenderness <br>  depression <br>  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a safety warning with regard to the use of the long-acting progesterone shot. Studies link this shot to a loss of bone density in women, although bone density may recover when a woman is no longer getting the shot.<br>  <br>  Doctors are not sure how this type of shot may affect the bone density of adolescent girls in the future, though. So girls who are considering the shot as a method of birth control should talk to their doctors about it. Girls who are receiving the shot should make sure that they are getting enough calcium each day, either through their diet or by taking calcium supplements.<br>  <br>  Girls who smoke should be sure to let their doctors know because smoking may be connected to this bone density loss. Smoking also increases a girl's chances of the other side effects of the shot.|`|de60502fc3103353ca6adcdbbb0cbe85aa	no I dont think you are pregnant|`|8f4b07588eddc144b3fac1addf419fa2aa	Possible side effects, though it sounds like you MIGHT be pregnant|`|CoqeXxJXaa	take an appointment with doctor|`|YpRHycKuaa	It is not 100% effective. I would make an appointment with a doctor.|`|RoKBzTr7aa	I don't think you'd be experiencing pregnancy symptoms this early if you just conceived 10 days ago. When I was pregnant, I found out about 4-5 weeks in. The first thing I noticed was sore breasts. I took a pg test and sure enough....The icky feeling didn't kick in until a few weeks later. I was on depo a very long time ago and I know it really messes with hormones, which could be your problem. I was told by my doc that even after you get off the shot it takes awhile for your body to go back to normal. My periods stopped while on the shot and it took awhile for them to come back. Hope this helps. If it keeps up I'd go to the doctor for fear that maybe theres something else wrong. But I just can't imagine pregnancy symptoms coming so soon after possible conception.

b0dee10a6de166bc265de45ecc7668e0aa	You abdomen getting hard every 20-30 minutes are contractions.   They just aren't very strong or effective.   How long have they been occuring?   They are helping to efface and dilate your cervix regardless.  When they are occurring get in a warm bath.  If they go away it was false labor.  If they speed up its labor.  <br>  <br>  The leg cramps are probably from lack of circulation.  The weight of your uterus is pressing on the arteries going to your legs.|`|UaKeW6bCaa	Sweetie I was 37 weeks pregnant with my first child and my water broke on its own....that was at 8 in the morning.

My daughter was five days late.  I also had those crazy muscle cramps under my ribcage and down lower.  At times they were quite sharp, but I think they were just the usual bodily reactions to having your insides smushed by a a baby.  I found that sleeping with a pillow under my feet to raise them up helped with the leg  cramps.  Also a hot water bottle or heat pack might help.<br>  <br>  That hardening you feel in your stomach is probably Braxton-Hicks contractions.  I had them periodically from my 20th week till I gave birth.  They're practice contractions your uterus makes to prepare for the real thing.  If they get more frequent and become very painful (like take your breath away painful), then it might be labor pains and you should call your doc or get to the hospital.<br>  <br>  I know you're uncomfortable and pretty miserable, but in a few days or weeks you'll be a mother and the cramps will go away.

So you will not be in labor until the cervix starts to change or dilate.|`|JAAWNXjkaa	Babies come when they are ready in healthy pregnancies.<br>  <br>  When you get the urge to clean house or tidy up (nesting instinct) you know the time is close.  <br>  <br>  Leg cramps are usually caused by low potassium levels in pregnant women.  Eat some bananas.|`|P34bgny5aa	Hi. i was about 37 weeks also and my water broke at 5 p.m. on a saturday and the baby was born sunday at 10:30 in the morning, so it takes a while.<br>  If you are not dilated now, dont worry about it, breaking of the water speeds up that process.<br>  <br>  Just out of curiosity, is this your first child??<br>  <br>  it sounds very similar to what happened to me.<br>  <br>  Dont worry too much if you dont start dilating naturally your doctor can help you with that.<br>  goog luck
OCcxlx6gaa	It's actually believed to be the opposite now. The presence of allergens and bacteria that dogs carry are considered beneficial to young children in preventing allergies. The fact is they can't figure out what causes allergies, only how to mildly suppress most of them. Allergies are caused when the immune system attacks allergens as though they were harmful to the body when in fact they are not. Your body will change its allergies from time to time based on your exposure and other unknown factors. They range from normal, milder reactions like pollens, dust and animals to more severe like the peanut or seafood allergies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/allergies/news/20031014/pets-may-prevent-allergies-in-kids" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/allergies/news/2003...</a><br>  <br>  If the concern is because of the behavior of your dog then that is different. Based on his size and temperament. Will he be jealous? Will he mess with the baby in the bassinet? These are valid concerns and have to do with the personality and relationships involved. Most of the time the dogs will accept the new baby as part of the family, but you still have to keep close watch on them. Many families contain pets and babies.<br>  <br>  I think your situation sounds fine, when the time comes if any problems should arise you can address them then, but it doesn't sound like there is any reason for concern yet.|`|f4abe532bc8e9f5313fa9c514240f91aaa	It probably won't cause problems unless your child is already prone to breathing problems. My dr told me that having the child exposed to a pet earlier would help her build a tolerance to the dander. I would bathe the dog more often so that there's not extra hair and dander floating around but I've had pets in the house with my daughter since she was about 3 months and she's fine|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	I have always had dogs, and they slept in the room with my kids and they are fine.  What was really funny, is if one of the kids made a noise, the dogs would come wake me up, never my wife always me, and would leave me alone until I went in and checked on the baby.  The only thing I have heard is watch out for cat, they can jump in the crib and lay in there and could suffocate the baby.  I don't know how true that is, but I have heard that....|`|096e860e43223453c5e7f5e27b547ff2aa	To tell you the truth, i think that exposing children to dirt and germs and things(within reason), actually helps them build a natural resistance to other germs. My husbands aunt is very anally retentive about her kids being dirty and touching things that might be dirty, in fact im sure she would disinfect her kids in household bleach if she could get away with it, and her kids are always sick, colds, asthma and just anything contagious that may be going around. My kids have always been exposed to dirt and dogs and other things, right from day one, and they are never sick, and if they do catch something, its only ever the nastiest thing going around, and they only ever get a mild case. I would consider it too close if the dog and the baby were both sleeping on your bed, on separate sides of the room would be fine. Aside from that, if you kick your dog out of your room now for the baby, the dog may develope jealousy issues, which i wouldnt blame her for, would you.<br>  <br>   Notice tho that i said 'within reason', on exposing your kids to germs, i mean, i do have generally clean kids, as clean as you can keep two boys anyway, but i dont mind them getting dirty in the first place. My currently 14 months old boy had just learned to crawl(about 8 months), so i had him outside with me while i dug up a garden bed, my eldest son turned it into a mud pit and both the boys ended up in the mud, sliding around and just generally having fun getting dirty, my neighbour just about had a fit, she got really upset with me, i didnt care, they were going to have a bath when i went inside, and i got some great photos.<br>  <br>  As long as it doesnt really worry you, dont stress, do what you think is best within your abilities.|`|6e888d8d44be69c614f3601bb6a0bf7caa	It is a possibility that it could lead to breathing problems and also if the child is allergic to pet dander it would case a definite problem.  If your child doesn't seem to be having any problems then I would say all is ok, but just keep an eye on the baby and watch for problems.|`|9LTmRJR6aa	Studies have shown that, unless there is a genetic reason for a child to develop allergies, those children that are exposed to animals are far less likely to develop asthma.  There are some that believe that being exposed to cats & dogs, causes the child to develop the antibodies to actually prevent the occurrence of allergies later on in life.|`|Xaeq6wkUaa	I just gave birth last week to a baby boy. I have asthma and i had a terrible attack after i gave birth. Dr told me to get rid of my 2 cats and dog if i can help it. She said animals fur as well as what animals can carry CAN cause problems for infants as far as asthma or allergies can occur. Now you dont obviously have to get rid of your dog but you may want to consider not having him sleep with you. when i had my first son i had to kick my cat out of the room cos he slept with me. In my honest opinion, having asthma myself, i would not wish it upon anyone and if you can prevent your child getting it, i would let the dog sleep out of your room.
HADvaH1caa	Are they on regular formula?  Soy formula seemed to delay my oldest's teeth.  My twins were born at 31 weeks but they got teir teeth just fine and they were on Enfamil Lipil.  you might ask for some extra calcium as a supliment from your Dr.  IF your Dr. says don't worry then don't.|`|AA11109728	I'm so glad when I see a question like yours!  It lets me know I'm not alone!  My daughter didn't have any teeth at that age either, and it's not that I was worried exactly, but wondering how many other kids were like her.  It seems everyone I talked to had never heard of a kid not having teeth at that age, except the doctor.  She assured me she had never seen a kid who didn't get teeth in.  Eventually, around 14 months, my daughter finally got her first two bottom teeth in!  And contrary to what the doc said about the rest coming in quick after that, all the rest took their sweet old time!  Now, at 2 1/2 yrs., my daughter has all of her teeth, including some or all of her 2 yr. molars. <br>  So yes, I was in the same situation, and it is normal for some kids.  Like your kids, my daughter also showed signs of teething around the normal 3 months old.|`|e51f6062bd000eff36008f1173cf7d70aa	It is not uncommon....some kids just develope in certain areas faster that others....if you are worried,  talk to the doc and they can take e-xrays or something along those lines to make sure everything is ok.|`|3ed2a9795378866bbf945647b8ff855eaa	Perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  My twins (now 16 months) had teeth by then, but I know several people whose babies did not get teeth until they were about a year, and that is not unusual -- there is an extremely wide range of what's "normal" when it comes to cutting teeth...just as there is a pretty wide range for most developmental things, actually! <br>  <br>  When you go for your well baby visits the doctor checks the status of teething, and if your twins' pediatrician isn't worried you shouldn't be either. Nothing "abnormal" here at all. (In addition, don't forget to account for your twins' prematurity -- from the way you worded your question I'm assuming that your twins are nearly 11 months actual/chronological age, putting them at 6 weeks less than that for their corrected/adjusted age.)<br>  <br>  They will have teeth! Hopefully soon -- not because there's a problem but because it sounds like they may be experiencing a long uncomfortable teething process, and it would be nice if they got a break from that for a short bit! (When their teeth do start to come in, incidentally, they may get a lot of them very quickly -- I've seen that happen with a lot of babies who cut teeth "late.")|`|AA10494118	My son didnt have any teeth until he was ten months old, then he only grew the four bottom ones.   All kids are different.  If you are really worried you can take them to the dentist for xrays.<br>  <br>  ps. hes 7 now with a full set of choppers.|`|AA10738746	First off God bless you for being able to handle twin baby boys. My wife and I have one 16 month old son and he keeps us busy. I would not sweat the teeth thing. All kids are different. I would think it is better to have them come in later anyway. My son has almost all of his in now and he has had a hard time with each one. Ask your doc, but I don't think it is a big thing. God bless you.|`|30e9c95215f06ac19816d3187bf54c6baa	dont worry about it, my nieces (twins also) didnt get their teeth until around 13-14 months. they say that the longer the teeth wait to come in, the stronger they come out.|`|AA11096071	I had the same prob... i thought oh no something is wrong with my son he hasnt had any teeth come in although is cousin had 3 already and they were 4 months apart. but some kids dont get there teeth to about 12-16 months and then they will get them not all at once but very close together. and the longer it takes to get there teeth the better that just means the more healthier there teeth are going to be. :) hope that helps a little take it easy dont worry about it to much it will happen when there body is ready.<br>  <br>  ~Mom With Same Issue~|`|qbXafrcvaa	have no worries everyone will teeth at different times it is usually late for twins to teeth it. they will have teeth before they are 2 if they don't then that is when you need to worry. my cousins child was 18 months old when he got his first tooth. don't worry its not going to hurt him to not have teeth my 9 month old just got his 2 bottom teeth and he has been eating chicken since 5 months old gumming it. <br>  <br>  mother of 5|`|u2baJPu8aa	I dont have twins and my son was 2 days late, but he had signs of teething at about 4months and he didn't get his first two teeth until his 1st birthday. Once they started coming in he would get them in multiples of 3 and 4 at a time. He is now 4 and has a mouth full of beautiful teeth. Good luck.
0e10f8baa16efc6e34edaadbc949b808aa	No, not the actual mucus plug.  You might feel your cervix dilating, which to me felt like stabbing pains, which in turn would cause the mucus plug to fall out.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	no at least with my 2 kids it didnt hurt neither time so i dont think so call ur dr in the morning and ask if u should b worried or not|`|57c8048751bb6dd1a49dc351791d9b29aa	No, it doesn't hurt at all.|`|jJm1Z0Z3aa	What do you mean hurt? It hurt when you passed it? I don't think it's supposed to hurt. When you lose your mucous plug it means your starting dilation and effacement. Usually labor is 1-3 weeks away after you lose your mucous plug. Is it like an uncomfortable feeling? Like your cervix opening? Maybe you should run it by your Dr.
03f6f5775d57f70c2671a2bb3d90a1bdaa	Yes, it can.  If you aren't on birth control & do not want to become pregnant & the sex has been within the past 5 days, I suggest you seek Plan B.  You need to get condoms to prevent STD's, as well as a reliable form of birth control to use along with them just to be sure.  Always better to be careful.|`|abce0e6734f6dfdf601a8582b5e80282aa	Yup, it's no different than ejaculation.|`|ELzTIqiqaa	Yes, it most definitely can.|`|dEd14ZaMaa	YES you can get pregnant by pre-*** why do you think people say don't use the pull out method? Sorry Sweety<br>  <br>  Hope things work out for ya!<br>  <br>  ~Sarah|`|vXXDzBaKaa	yeap i had a cousin who use to always use the pull out method and he did pull out each time but she got pregnant off the precum twice!! there is sperm in the precum so can definitly get pregnant
DltogjPtaa	the doc will giv u a referral and then you make an appointment for an ultrasound|`|THZFn6K2aa	unless youve had previous problems with a pregnancy, you probably wont have your first ultrasound till around 16 weeks.  your dr will usually make the appt for you.  lol dont be in such a rush for the ultrasound, i was for my first too, till i found out how much water i had to drink, and how long i had to hold it for. good luck, and enjoy your pregnancy|`|D0OqrICSaa	you will probably have to make a different appointment but some obygns have a small ultra sound machine in there office depends on the facility. good luck|`|TbttiTkMaa	Well your far enough along to deffinetly get one!  sure hope you do!!! i got my first ultrasound at 6 weeks, i am now 3 months.. but i had a miscarriage before so they were just looking out.. well maybe call your doctor and ask.<br>  Good luck & congrats!|`|ZMZ1IsPWaa	Every practitioner is different.  Mine waits until 20 weeks and only does others either sooner or later for good medical reasons.  To be honest, unless you have a medical reason I don't see the point really.  However, since you're 3 months along already and you haven't been to a doctor yet they may order one.  Don't ask them to determine the sex though because it's still way too early to tell with any certainty.  Best of luck and enjoy your pregnancy!|`|vXXDzBaKaa	well with my doctor i didnt get an ultrasound till i was 5 months..the only way they gave u 1 sooner was when u couldnt remember when ur last period was, so they could figure out your due date..but usually u have to make another appointment to get an ultrasound|`|AA11614215	Depends on your doctor.  If it is your very first visit to the OB/GYN they will probably just check your vitals and give you a pregnancy test.  It never hurts to ask though!|`|AA11712743	you will have a different appointment for the ultrasound, but it is possible that you will get to hear the baby's heart beat, I did at my 3 month check up.  normally it doesn't take too long to get an ultrasound appointment either, good luck|`|zBbyaq8Taa	you can ask the your if he/she can schedule you an ultrasound most  likely you can get one the same day you go to the doctor. it all depends if that part of the facility  schedules are not full.
WZT5ZYXkaa	Most times between 5 and 6 months and it depends how slim you are too, some girls it's 4 months. Don't worry you'll get there soon.  Good luck.|`|Mdi1LjY1aa	probably around 5 months. i'm 22 weeks prego and i'm just now getting to where my tummy is hard. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|vXXDzBaKaa	around 5 months|`|yDfq0YlXaa	sorry...there's no clear answer..but usually when the baby gets big enough to really fill out your belly
AA12175970	I'm 3 months with twins. My belly is definitely bigger, but you can't really tell I'm pregnant yet. I just look like I'm thick in the waist. If you are only having one baby, it may take a while to really show. With my daughter, I started  showing around 5 months. I was small, too. 5'4" and about 105 when I got pregnant with her.|`|vXXDzBaKaa	every body goes through this regardless of how many times they have been pregnant before...i had that stomach until i was 6 months with my first baby and until i was 5 with my second.. lol but it will change trust me|`|CVcK5OiVaa	You will start showing a lot around 5 months. And being so small unfortunantly you will show more and possibly sooner. But you are allowed to have a belly on you, you are eating for two now, soon it will get hard and round. If they are big before getting pregnant they might not get the round belly and it might look like you are talking about and still be pregnant.
64cf42bc52ec850f15dc4a39f2b95979aa	You do not want it that is for sure, but if you catch it, it will not hurt the baby! I had it in 2 pregnancies and all was fine and the dr. had assured me it was ok! Best wishes!|`|vXXDzBaKaa	thats the same as being around any1 else that just has a cold and a stomach virus isnt even contagious u should be fine.. i had cold through out most of my pregnancy with my second..the dr gave me antibiotics and it didnt even work i had to wait it out plus when u get sick when u r pregnant u are sick a lot longer than u normally would b if u werent
MHOxPs8Oaa	No, I wouldn't care. So what if I ate all the ice cream already I liked it. That's what I would say.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	I'd be like, "And just WHAT are you implying my dearest?" as I am chopping veggies with my *large* Pampered Chief knife :)|`|VS8mactUaa	my goodness no, why would it, Im pregnant and my boyfriend always says things like that with a serious face then, smiles and bursts into laughter, we just laugh about it, and I say wait til you get older and have a nice bi belly it'll be revenge time. Dont take everything to heart or all youre going to do is start un-necessary conflicts, remember your horomobes are playing a part now, but his feelings cans till get hurt if you yell at him for a simple joke, unless he always does it while knowing it bothers you. Good Luck|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	what ice cream? there was ice cream?  ugh, i TOLD you to save some of that for me .....  wtf?      he gets flustered and ends  up taking the blame  lol|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	that ranks right up there with - are you getting another snack?<br>  <br>  evil eye followed by a curse of balding - thats his punishment|`|lzivF4Idaa	nahhh lol. id just be like "yeah, i did. too bad for you!"|`|sBHhnDwaaa	Depends on what kind.... The chocolate, chocolate chip cookie dough, rocky road, etc    deserves a "What the heck do you expect? Its the good kind!! (Plus we only get the tiny ones of it...)<br>  <br>  The vanilla, yes. "It was going to go freezer burnt!"|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	He should have learned prior to marriage that even if the ice cream is all gone, and even if you are the one that ate it - attention should never be brought to it. there ishould be an unspoken agreement - don't ask about the ice cream, you won't feel my fist.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Oh my hubby says stuff like that all the time. Who cares? He's the one that scarfs down nearly a whole box of donuts in one sitting. After so long you start to tune 'em out|`|L2Nde54Haa	i say tie him 2 the bed, wear ur sexiest outfit,and eat another tub right in front of him while oogling hot men on the web!!|`|4YIUxSlYaa	Nah.  I'd just say 'Yep!' - in fact I'm going to get hubby to make me a milkshake now.. yum..|`|7bTOY5vHaa	Oh yeah that would require punishment! When I was pregnant with my son my hubby was always saying stuff like that.|`|sxecXFgraa	Yes, major *** kissing time.|`|y6g0RnuAaa	well I just say "What ice cream?"|`|2xMtNeWiaa	no not at all! i say that to my gf. she is a candy lover and whenever i buy her candy (bags at a time) and she finishes them the next time i see her, i dont ever have any intentions implying shes a pig for eating it all. i actually get happy that she ate it all, cuz that means she liked it that much. <br>  <br>  there should be no punishment. just another reason to go out to the store together.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	He's already being punished by not getting ice cream. :P<br>  <br>  I don't get told that.  But I do find it very, very annoying  when I've got a bowl and he'll stick his finger in there and get some or if I've got a cone and he takes a lick.  MY ice cream not his!|`|132a94967b26774746922b6b7c03bf49aa	No - I think he just wanted some ice cream and it was all gone.  Nothing worse than a craving for a cold creamy ice cream treat and nothing but ice cubes and frozen veggies in the freezer.  No harm, no foul.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	No, but it would be if he finished all the ice cream.|`|euwbbibZaa	No as long as he isn't saying like he can tell or that your looking bigger don't worry|`|AA12145826	*GASP* Them's fightin' words!<br>  <br>  That's it, he's banned from the remote for a week!|`|bspRfskYaa	Deny it!

Spank his butt!
gKzr7pNMaa	Don't take anything - let it dry up on its' own.  Your breasts will be larger and somewhat engorged for a while.  This may get worse for a few days, then it will start getting better.  Don't worry about blocked ducts - once the milk starts drying up, you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  If you have extreme pain from the engorgement, get someone to help you bind your breasts with an extremely tight wrap (like a baby blanket) wrapped around your chest and pinned tightly.  The pressure will help relieve the pain.  |`|Bce0smuVaa	i read to bind your chest tightly and the milk would go away on its own. still breast feeding tho so not sure if this works sorry =( i also think they stopped doing the pills for some reason....|`|F4FJVq37aa	My friend had to wrap gauze around her breasts tightly. Her doctor told her to do that to help. It helped her. |`|AWqZWd9caa	My aunt said to put a leaf of cabbage in your bra... something about the cabbage leaf helps dry them out... I didn't try it, but let me know if it works if you do... |`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	As long as you aren't painfully engorged then you can probably leave well enough alone.<br>  <br>  They no longer use pills or shots to dry up milk as they all had very serious side effects (high doses of hormones are unwise really).<br>  <br>  Peppermint or sage can help reduce your supply.  Binding has been shown to be ineffective.  Decongestants are sometimes used but I wouldn't because of the side effects.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.prematureoptimism.com/linkBlog/?p=67" rel="nofollow">http://www.prematureoptimism.com/linkBlo...</a>|`|9eno55hCaa	if it gets to be to much you can get a small hand pump and express enough to make them comfortable.  The only way to avoid blocked ducts and the pain associated is to keep the milk flowing. It can sometimes take a while to dry up.  My grandmother said cabbage leaves work to help the process along though.  Just putting them over the breasts.|`|rR4q2e9qaa	I quit and pumped, and was down to pumping just at night, and I still got very engorged and it was very painful.  I used cabbage leaves and also ice packs and heating pad with massage helped the blocked ducts a lot!  It took me 2 weeks for my breast to get back to normal.|`|38824a69f42c37f0e048158c3d0e0a30aa	Maybe if you do pump, do it only a little bit till your breasts feel better, don't completely drain them.  But if I were you I'd just stop completely and let them dry up on their own.  That's what I did.  |`|siDcjgJCaa	They dont give the pills anymore because they are not good for your health.  I stopped nursing completely about a month ago and I still dont fit into my pre-pregnancy bras. I am hoping they go back to normal soon.|`|krZx8FRhaa	it can take a week to a month to not feel engorged. I dont' believe doctors presribe those pills anymore. Try cold compresses, until the pain is over.

Babies R Us and Target both carry similar wraps that work well. It's very comfortable and has many different holding positions.

1gDOVXESaa	You could donate them somewhere or just list them on craigslist|`|CRYhCEuzaa	i was told to bring them to maybe the health clinic. hospital might be able to do something with them, pregnancy clinic too. be creative:)|`|pXSKSS3daa	You could try taking them to a pregnancy/new mom center. If they will not take them then try selling them on Craigslist(I've seen many people do this with opened boxes).|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Does your town/city have an office for assistance (aside from the Family Services/Welfare office)?

I'm sure they have women who could use them.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	Freecycle or craigslist. Free diapers are free diapers..I wouldn't complain taking about 44 FREE opened diapers. |`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Donate them to a women's shelter.

I know that our church has a food pantry that has diapers and even infant clothing and such for people who are in need.  Most people who come to our pantry are do not attend church, but they know they can get help no questions asked.<br>  You could also donate them to a local pregnancy center or put them on craigslist for free or even to sell.

You could ask around and see if someone knows of a pregnant woman or new mommy and daddy who could use the diapers.

fMilDRgLaa	Are you uncomfortable with your current bra now?  I recommend waiting 10 days post baby for true size.  If you are uncomfortable get a nursing sleep or comfort bra by medela until then. Many nursing bras are forgiving and will adjust up and down with you. Bravado makes a great bra called the body silk seamless nursing bra.  It is sized s,m,l,xl.  Medela makes great supportive bras too.<br>  <br>  Get fitted in a shop that sells nursing bras.  The best way is to have them fit under the armpit area and pulled snug. Then around the fullest part of your breasts.<br>  <br>  I would say that yes, most women go up in band size while pregnant and then back down in band size.  Many women get too big of a band and too small of a cup!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I started at a 32, went to a 36 while pregnant, and am back to 32-34 while breastfeeding. I would go with a 34 to be safe although you can always get a band extender if you find a 32 to be snug, it's hard to make a bra smaller.<br>  <br>  Only buy one bra while pregnant, get the rest after breastfeeding is well established and your body decides on a size.|`|IYLlupdkaa	probably get a 34
sxecXFgraa	It is scary and I thank the Lord above that I'm fortunate enough to have a job with flex hours so I can met my kids at the bus stop in the afternoon and my husband is at the bus stop with them in the morning.|`|TQW5E6olaa	Scary idea...I'm not there yet and we do have family nearby, but I'd consider paying someone to pick her up, take her home, and stay with her till I got home, like a tutor or nanny. I'm thinking ages 12-15, because here we do have daycare through 5th grade.<br>  <br>  Self defense is a great idea, I'd take it with her.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Well my daughter is only 7 months so I don't have to worry about that just yet but it is starting to worry me about these kinds of things. If I was in your shoes. I would see if her and a friend could walk together, maybe your daughter walk over to that house talk to her parents so she is not walking alone. That would be my guess. Maybe she could have a tracker phone with the cops on speed dial?|`|FXINmF6saa	What I would recommend you do is talk to your daughter and see if she can walk home with a friend if they live close by. When you talk to her also let her know the dangers that are out there and that if a stranger ever follows her or anyone is trying to bug her she needs to either pretend to be on the phone with someone that way they know to leave her alone or to walk to the nearest house and pretend like she lives there and tell the people what is going on. That's what I'm going to tell my son to do if I can't pick him up or have anyone take care of him. I would also consider putting him in an after school program she can go to until you can pick her like a club or even a sport. That should help you out to have her around as many people and for as long as possible.|`|qaiYanF2aa	Absolutely, I did.  My husband was in the military and gone for a number of years on overseas duty (Vietnam) and I needed to work for the money!!  <br>  <br>  I think though you will worry less if you make sure she really understands about letting people approach her while she is walking to and from.  You don't want someone close enough to grab a wrist - even if they are asking a question.. <br>  <br>  Make sure she knows not to answer the door when she is home alone unless she can see the person and knows them well - and if they are male I would say - don't answer it anyway.<br>  <br>  My girls (3) and I all took some basic self defense classes that were taught at the local YWCA.  It was interesting and I think we all learned a lot and were very much more 'aware'.  <br>  <br>  You do not want to make her fearful but better a little paranoid than abducted!  <br>  <br>  Yes, mothers worry and you just have to do the best you can with educating them and making them aware how vulnerable they could be if they don't watch what they are doing.<br>  <br>  Also having her check in with you when she is home safely is a good thing and helped me a lot.  <br>  <br>  Just take care and do what you can.  That is all any of us can do.  Good luck and God Bless.|`|5HWHPPeiaa	my husband and i can't get home before the kids do...my 10 year old has to go in by herself before the other kids get home from their school...i hate it so bad...but i just gotta hope that the Lord will keep her safe...she comes in, locks the door, sets the alarm, and calls me right away every day...still scary though.
2fX0p9ZZaa	I'm sorry but u just answered your own question....<br>  You dont stay awake to feed him, you leave him EVERYNIGHT to wake up with a saturated nappy...<br>  When my kids woke up durning the night i changed their bum so they wouldnt wake up wet...<br>  <br>  I understand that your tired but if you cant get your *** out of bed to change his nappy so that he dosent get wet( even though u know he will wake wet) there is something wrong with you....<br>  <br>  I bet u wouldnt go to bed and piss urself and lay there wet all night would you? NO of course ud get up and get changed wouldnt u...of course u would...<br>  But hey i spose your the one who has to do all that extra washing everyday, seeing as hes soakes through onto ur bed youd have to wash your bedding every da and all his clothes...<br>  <br>  Rebecca: werre not talking about waking a sleeping baby, were talking about a baby who has woken because of hunger and that this ***** is to bloody lazy to sit up 4 thirty seconds and change her babies wet ***...<br>  All of you who think that this is ok shouldnt be Parents.|`|vOomJtbsaa	I don't wake my son to change him either, the phrase "never wake a sleeping baby" really applies to this situation.  If its not bothering him and he's not up screaming, don't wake him.  It doesn't hurt him & it definitely doesn't make you a bad mom.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	no.... most people dont change babys diaper at night... that wakes kids up and they cant get into a regular routine... then they sleep all day and keep you up all night... hes fine... unless he had diarhea one night or something... he should be fine with one changing before he goes to bed and then when he wakes up... good luck :)|`|Wjm53KM2aa	I dont think it is aweful.  Babies that sleep through the night stay in the same diaper all night.  If it is really really bad then change it but if not then jsut buy really good night time diapers so that he isn't getting his clothes all wet and put on a good bum cream before bed!|`|fRIEHBJOaa	i never change my son, unless he wakes up or i smell poop while he's sleeping.  <br>  <br>  i need my sleep!  <br>  <br>  so, no, you're not a bad mom. |`|9eno55hCaa	Nope it doesnt. I only change my daughters diaper if its after 5am when she wakes up (this is my usual wake up time cause I make breakfast for my husband when hes working).  She has sleeping gowns so I can easily check her diaper and I will change it if its absolutely necessary.  But most of the time I just leave it till morning.<br>  <br>  We just use more leakproof diapers at night. And during the day we use generic cause I change her so often in the daytime.|`|hcwp2mAyaa	hmmmm... if bubs doesnt seem to mind i guess its ok. although i have heard that urine can also cause nappy rash( apparently when a wet nappy is left on too long the urine reacts with something in the nappy and the urine turns to ammonia and that is what causes it). my suggestion is to use a barrier cream... i use sudocrem|`|r1KS5GsDaa	my daughter sleeps during the night and i dont change her diaper before i go to sleep. she sleeps from 9 or 10 till 7 or 8..shes 2 months. she doesnt cry to be fed in the morning or to be changed..haha..youre not a bad mom.|`|qBtTAgBqaa	What size diapers is he in? Huggies Overnights start at size 3. When breastfeeding my twins at night, I used to just keep a couple diapers bedside. If you put him to bed in the infant gowns, it makes it a lot easier too.|`|fhYVEpmUaa	If he's not getting a rash and he doesn't notice I don't see too much harm.<br>  <br>  If he does develope a rash then there is no excuse to not change him.|`|pVV0xPcqaa	nO I DON'T THINK SO..I SOMETIMES DO THE SAME|`|JrqW7HPjaa	No, I do the same thing. You can't help it because you're so tired and I've had no problem with my daughter getting a rash, I feel bad sometimes too but you know. I do change her at least once or I wake her dad to change her so I can rest right before nursing but as long as its not giving her a rash then why bother when they're so peaceful. Sometimes I hesitate to change her becuase shes so hungry she just wants to eat then and there and then other times.. she makes it clear shes uncomfortable in her diaper..<br>  <br>  |`|iYNONWGMaa	I did exactly what you're doing. And it worked GREAT! Both baby and I got much better sleep that way. It was super easy to just pop out a breast for him suckle and go right back to sleep. My partner took care of all the midnight diaper changes, when they were necessary.. like when he was poopy. Our baby is about 7 months old now, and he has never had any diaper rash. We haven't used any creams or ointments on his little tush.<br>  <br>  We did have a few occasions where baby wet our bed. That's when I went out and got a simple small waterproof bed pad to put underneath him when he slept. It has protected our mattress on numerous occasions since. :) Don't stress about midnight diaper changes. They're usually not critical, and a change first thing in the morning is usually adequate. More important is that you get as much rest as you can. It's the only way to get your brain back and have the energy to wrangle the baby in the day.<br>  <br>  Very few parenting books or websites advocate sleeping with your baby. Dr. Sears is one of the notable exceptions. It really is convenient for those nighttime feeds, reassuring for the baby, and a great bonding experience for everyone. We just love snuggling with our baby. And as he gets older, it has become fun to wake up with him next to us. We have serene morning moments making faces and playing with the covers. Yes, sometimes you want your bed to yourself or opportunities for cuddle time with your partner. But it's easy to shift a deeply sleeping baby into his crib or co-sleeper without any fuss. Easy peasy.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't feel bad at all. If it works for you and your little one, you're doing something right. :) <br>  <br>  Congrats to you and the babe!|`|rP13MznFaa	As long as he doesn't get rashes, I'd say it's fine.<br>  I would make sure you butter him up really well with lots of diaper cream to protect his skin, though.<br>  And if the diaper is obviously poopy, I'd change him, too. Poop is always a reason for an immediate diaper change. If they sit in it for too long, then they get rashes that it takes DAYS to get rid of, when it would have only took you MINUTES to get rid of it in the first place. <br>  But if he's not pooping, pee isn't so bad, especially if you have cream on him.|`|YtBvjnOiaa	No if he doesnt notice then its not hurting him, although he could get a diaper rash more easily and then thats worse. I would change him maybe once at night to try and prevent diaper rash and changing your sheets everyday must be annoying.|`|AA11123225	As long as he is not getting a rash and he dont mind being wet then no i dont think its a big deal.  I remember that feeling of waking him up to much that he will be up a while.  |`|9hUXiBCyaa	i don't think your being a bad mom for not changing him during the night. but i do think if for some reason you could get up you should at least change him one more time before morning.|`|VKprKVHWaa	Like everyone said, if hes not getting a rash, then its not mean...if he does then i would change him often...that hurts bad...i would also try maybe just a bigger size for ex: my daughter is 13 months. and not potty trained yet...she goes to bed at 9 or so and wakes up maybe once the whole night or none it depends....so when she wakes up at 8 am, then i change her...i'm not going to wake her up to change her....but i would try the next size up so that it can hold more...how would you feel to wake up every morning with your pajamas soaked through...he may not cry, but it can't be to comfortable. i get what you mean with not wanting to wake-wake him up, but when you said mostly cuz your tired, that is sorta selfish...so to sum it up, if he gets a rash definately change him often, your his mother, even if he wakes up for 3 hours its your job....if not just get a bigger size diaper...but if it is like what my daughter did at 10,11,12 months (she just now sleeps through the night) then don't worry....good luck lol.....|`|a35a45e3355dff894c2ff62e0a85d82baa	In my son's first 2 weeks, I changed him every feeding during the night. Now, he's 8 weeks, and I change him once at night. And honestly, I only do it because he gets too cold being wet. I think you should just do whatever works for you and your baby! If he's not getting a diaper rash, then don't worry about it! If there's a wet spot, maybe the diaper isn't thick enough, try getting diaper inserts to make them more absorbant, or changing diapers*. When he starts sleeping through the whole night, are you going to set an alarm to wake up and change his diaper? No, so don't worry about it now. <br>  *I mean changing diaper brands
r7q8LW7Aaa	Natural yoghurt - preferably plain - can help both when eaten and when applied directly to the area.|`|AA11659150	Any yogurt with active cultures.  But you know it IS safe to use Monistat 3 or 7 during pregnancy?  It is EXTREMELY common for pregnant women to get yeast infections.  <br>  <br>  I've had two myself and the first time, the on call operator didn't even put me through to the on call nurse.

wiAVa1H5aa	It's an annual pelvic exam, they do a PAP, check for STDs, and talk about things that you might want to change before getting pregnant - like starting prenatal vitamins, getting your teeth cleaned, getting vaccinated for pertussis, measles and mumps, chicken pox (and etc... if you haven't had them kept up to date or you never had chicken pox), stopping drinking alcohol altogether, lowering blood pressure, loosing weight, starting exercising, and often will do a blood draw to check for hypothyroidism if there is a family history.<br>  <br>  Yes you should, to prevent complications and birth defects and to have a smooth pregnancy.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	I think they check you out down there to see if yo ucan have kids...and everything.....|`|BItqJ1Vnaa	I don't think it is necessary, but it doesn't hurt either. I happened to have one because my annual exam was just about the time we were going to try for a baby. I got good info about taking prenatal vitamins before you even start trying (you especially want a lot of folic acid in your system right from the beginning to help with initial development) and I got some referrals to OB doctors ahead of time which was comforting to me. The basic strategy I got was to eat/drink whatever you want the first two weeks of the month and cut back on caffeine/alcohol the last half of the month until you know if you're pregnant or not. Hope that helps!|`|kY8JTDD6aa	Pre-pregnancy checkups are mostly to screen out any serious problems like gestational diabetes and pre-ecclampsia.  It's advisable but can get really tiring especially if you have other children.
eUuFPJAFaa	I stopped sterilising about 6 weeks ago and baby is 6.5 months now. So far no tummy bugs, I use hot soapy water and he's fine - I still use cooled boiled water to make his milk up.|`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	According to WebMD: "In the old days when water supplies were not reliably clean, it made sense to sterilize. But now, sterilizing bottles, nipples, and water is mostly unnecessary.<br>  <br>  Unless your water supply is suspected to harbor contaminated bacteria, it is as safe for your baby as it is for you. There is no reason to sterilize what is already safe.<br>  <br>  Sterilizing the bottles and nipples is also unwarranted. Thorough cleaning with soap and water gets rid of almost all germs. And once on the bottle, the nipple begins to pick up all the germs in the environment, so a "sterile" nipple and bottle is just a pipe dream anyway."<br>  <br>  I have never sterilized bottles - when you really think about it, what are you accomplishing anyway, unless you take the nipples and bottles directly out of the sterilizer and use them immediately, you aren't doing much.  My doctor said it's completely unnecessary.  I also breastfeed and have been told to not even use soap on my nipples - and I certainly can't sterilize them! =)|`|9eno55hCaa	I only steralized the bottles when i rbought them home before I used them.  But we use a bottle warmer since she only gets pumped milk.  I guess it balances out.  I do steralize them if we drop them or if we take them anywhere or if anyone other than myself or my husband feeds her.  Shes a premie so we have to be careful but I dont want to totally overdo it either.|`|mJm6VuwGaa	I personally stopped sterilizing at around your baby's age.  I still did sterilize them but maybe once a week.  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|qfKctLGGaa	My daughter is 9 months and I still sterilise her bottles and teats (8 at a time) and leave them in the steriliser until they have all been used (usually 3 bottles a day) and then start again.

I don't sterilise spoons or bowls but am a bit wary of teats as they spend so long in her mouth.|`|AA11022786	Depends on your local water supply. If it's reliable and clean then it's up to you when you WANT to stop. But if you have well water or an unreliable water source then you should continue sterilizing past the first year. |`|MjashZnvaa	Ive only ever sterilized every couple of days. My baby is 7 months old now and I do it about once a week, or longer.

Sorry, but thats just how it is the first month or two.  You need to change your expectations, not change the baby.  SHe needs to suck for comfort AND to regulate your supply.  DOn't think that milk just magically appears in your breasts, it's there because the baby is sucking to stimulate it.  Let her nurse as much as she wants.  It will pass, I promise.  My son did this for about 8 weeks, now I have hard time getting him to nurse because he's busy looking at stuff!   It's totally normal, short lived, and necessary to the breast feeding relationship.  If you really can't take it then give her a pacifier but be warned that this may hurt your supply in the long run.  So it's up to you if you want to take that risk.  2 weeks is so young and your supply usually takes abotu 6 weeks to be established, even more, so I would just let her nurse as much as possible.  Good luck!|`|9eno55hCaa	Slowly getting her used to a pacifier should help.  My advice is to get a sling and carry her with her head close to the breast.

You need to put your feet up and do nothing else but hang out with baby -- sleep when she sleeps, etcetera. <br>  <br>  But she is not "using you as a pacifier." Babies with plastic plugs jammed in their mouth are using them as mothers, not the other way around. Very vulgar to think of your mothering in terms of being "used."|`|9FkdXmQRaa	I don't know what you can do. I DO know however that a pacifier will often cause babies to reject the actual breast when they become accustomed to the pacifier.<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, ask your baby's doctor.|`|a6103b5448a81b3f2d761f035154c522aa	She loves you and wants to be near you!!  This should be flattering!|`|0ef4504856f427a4db1849e9da27dadaaa	My baby is 10 months old and still uses me as a paci!! LOL! Your baby is only 2 weeks old. It is great that she is latching on and wanting to suck and eat. That's what newborns do. Although, if you don't want her to always use YOU as a pacifier, keep giving her binkies. She will take one eventually. I have three boys. They all were major breastfeeders. Some babies love it more than others. I don't think that it's something to be concerned about yet. Hope this helps.|`|MF8XiNxzaa	I know your breastfeeding and will hear from every doctor to not do this.. but basically she's not getting enough to eat and you might want to consider putting some formula in a bottle with your breast milk.  My sister-in-law had to do this with my nephew and he is now doing great! Good luck!|`|r6F5lQ8Naa	You should slowly try to get her off on a pacifier, You just quickly put a warm pacifier on so she doesn't know.
Z8Ui1ugLaa	It's something to think about and you have many months to ponder it.  I'm 33 and I was just recently pregnant w/ my 3rd but unfortunately miscarried at 16 weeks.  My doctor didn't ask me that question and at my age I don't think I would.  <br>  <br>  Here's something to think of because like you I have had a c-section and I think of scar tissue building up as I get older.  If I have to go through the birth and c-sections and worry about scar tissue there do I want to worry about scar tissue elsewhere.  I would make my husband do it, it's the least he can do.  I carry the babies, gain the weight, go through horrific hormonal ups and downs.  A vasectomy doesn't' hurt that much.|`|WXExyAlWaa	One of my close friends just had a sterilisation surgery, and she's just come off the opiate painkillers a couple days ago. It's painful for quite a while afterwards. If I were you I would go on the pill or get an IUD instead - both sterilisation and having a baby should be things you only do if you're completely sure about it. <br>  <br>  A vasectomy is a much more simple procedure if your fiance really doesn't want more children.|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	i am in my teens and dont want kids but i dont want to get sterilized because later on in life i may want kids but i have heard that if you get your tubes tied that there is a chance of them getting undone after like 6 years but it is totally up to you i would talk it over with him|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	well I had mine done after the birth of my forth child.  I am GLAD I did it!  Some of the side effect is you will be really sore ect.  But you may not notice as much b/c you will already have pain from your c section|`|wl7tlYOYaa	I wouldnt do it if you cringe is because you really dont want to. hubby wants me to do the same thing I said no how about and IUD? he was perfectly okay with that.|`|zBz10IiOaa	hi hun,i have to have mine clamped because this last pregnancy i have had alot of problems this will be my second and with the problems i have had they suggested i go ahead with it i will not get them cute,tied or burned and me and the hubby want to try for a girl way later on<br>  p.s i got pregnant the first time on the shot and this second one i had an IUD!|`|f4AJHCHKaa	I told my hubby that if I had a C-Section for our last child then I would get them tied, otherwise he needs to get snipped. I think that being pregnant and giving birth is enough for us women, the men an step up and do something!! haha. If you don't feel comfortable doing it then I would say hold off, and just use another method of bc. Good luck!!|`|AA10196172	If he doesn't want any more, there's always vasectomy.<br>  <br>  Really, sterilization doesn't matter; you won't notice the difference. There's always the problem, though that it sounds so definite and final.<br>  <br>  The other thing is you better be SURE you don't want more children.|`|ixD2RnqTaa	Looks like im in the same situation as you, 2 kids by my ex and 27 weeks with my 3rd.<br>  Allthough, Im never going to get my tubes tied.<br>  He cant force you if you dont want to, Its your body.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Heck no I wouldn't get my tubes tied. Tell him if he is that enthusiastic about no more kids then tell him to get a vasectomy!|`|vygYFdsSaa	I don't think I'd get my tubes tied. Don't let your fiancee pressure you into doing anything. Sounds like he doesn't want to be sterilized...|`|6bc1daa67c2e712a9d1fdf83a2a7f067aa	No have him get a Vascetamy you r going through the labor have him do somthing|`|Dfeemjagaa	if any doubt, no. better to get a five year implant. talk with your ob about it.|`|JazebGv9aa	I would not get my tubes tied, let him get a vasectomy. You will be going through enough you don't need anything else on top of that. Plus it is easier to reverse a vasectomy then undoing your tubes. A Vasectomy isn't even a surgery, just an out patient procedure. You never know, you may want more kids someday.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	I have gotten my tubes tied. after four kids, I wanted to. The main side effect I've noticed is that my flow is a little heavier than it was before I had kids, but that might be because my body changed. Nothing serious. Anyhow, wiki has a lot of good info about it, if you want to research it.|`|kY8JTDD6aa	I can't imagine ever ever getting my tubes tied, but that's me.  Do what you think is best.  Follow your heart.  Ask your fiance if you don't get your tubes tied if he will get himself sterilized.  If he won't I don't think he's being fair.  And what if he dies or whatever and you are with someone else that really wants to have a child?  Naw.  I wouldn't do it but it's your decision.|`|z8YGEk0qaa	I'm still young but I know a lot of older people who decided to get their tubes tied when they were younger and want kids now. There are other means of long term birth control, like IUD or there is a little matchstick like thing that they put in your arm, I think they both last 3-5 years!|`|FYDw1rjlaa	No, because I still want to have children. Even if I don't anymore, I rather be on the pill or something instead of that. Once you do that it's done and you can not reverse it because it is dangerous to me. There are so many ways to pervent being pregnant.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	I wouldn't get my tubes tied..I'd get on the pill thouhg....I mean....what if, later on in life you want another baby....<br>  soo..yeah..|`|sdtqTbmoaa	me and hubby had this talk way before i got pregnant. he only wants one..which im fine with. so hes getting fixed.|`|h93SVSxLaa	mine are tied... in fact i had the surgery 13 hours after having my daughter.i had them saudered so there is no reversing mine. I like the fact that i don't have to deal with the pill and the weight gain from any birth control and trying to remember. They start asking you now because they have to legally ask you and have you sign papers something like 3 months prior to having your child. (atleast it's legally 3 months prior in Idaho) With the c-section they can do it as the sew everything else up and really your recovery doesn't change.|`|kvYgopThaa	It is your decision don't let anyone talk you into it if you don't want to have it done. If he doesn't want more children then let him have the procedure done to him. Its your body and your decision think about what you want and weigh your options you have some time to make your decision don't do anything rash until your sure. If you decide you want to have the procedure done than that is what you should do but if you think in any way you will regret it than don't have it done, and if your husband doesn't agree than get him to get one. It won't really be easier for you to get one than for him to get one if you are having a c-section because they will be taking the baby from your stomach and operating there not your Virginia. Men never want to get the procedure done but i think after all we go through they can go through some small procedure like that if they are the ones that don't want anymore kids lol. good luck and think about it before you get it done|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	Well I am having baby #2 and I am also having a c-sec your fiance sounds JUST LIKE MY HUSBAND!!! LoL!!  We only want two and I really can't see myself having any more even if we split cause two is a lot to me...But anyway I am going to go ahead with my tubal as of right now I have really bad veins that hurt so bad and I can't imagine going thru this again I mean it could get worse!! But you can get the Mirena it is a 5 year contraceptive... And there are side effects like you can still get pregnant in your tubes and it can be fatal to you so if you DO get it done and you think you might be pregnant they say to get to the doctor cause your tube can burst... Good luck I hope you make the right decision for you! :)
K5TrkUhCaa	Lol I love how you worded the question. Yes, I am guilty of this as well. I can't stand to waste anything (food or otherwise) especially knowing that there are others in this world who are suffering. If I'm too full to eat it then I always save the leftovers for later or the next day.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	Moms and dads who are with their kids a lot, notoriously start getting a third tire around their waist. And its because they dont want to WASTE. But you know getting heavier, feeling like the garbage can etc... is just not worth it. I have my 4 year old scrape her plate directly into the trash, unless its meat, and she knows to put it on the one counter for the dogs breakfast the next morning. That way theres no temptation. And less work for MOMMY !|`|bspRfskYaa	It's a terrible habit but I have to admit to doing it.  I love chicken nuggets and would never cook them for myself so I can never resist when there are some left over<br>  A friend of mine pours washing up liquid on it straight away so she can't go back and polish off the leftovers.|`|O6DSFJbTaa	They say when you do that, count 25 calories for every bite you take.  That is the average.  That adds up to alot of extra calories a day.<br>  <br>  When I realized this, I stopped eating off the kids plates.<br>  <br>  WOW 5 thumbs down, jeeze you would thing I said something wrong.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	lol i was just talking about this to a friend......we had spaghetti bolognese tonight nd sure enough i ate hers when she was done...and the garlic bread she didnt want lol ...i feel horrible but it was goood:)|`|VuUz8NgKaa	No, the dog does.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I just call the dogs, lol|`|cAtWxJG1aa	Ah, darn, I got all hopeful that this was finally a housekeeping question on which our family came out okay (no, we don't leave the leftover food out on the counters, lol).  But sadly, that wasn't your question and apparently we don't get points for that (and I can't think of much in our housekeeping generally that we would get points for, either).<br>  <br>  In answer to your actual question, if it's a dessert food or french fries, absolutely.|`|sxecXFgraa	No.  Overeating just so you don't dump it in the garbage is still wasting food.  Instead of the garbage, put it in a compost.|`|TQW5E6olaa	I've been eating her extra food and I'm gaining weight because it!!! So i've started giving us both smaller portions...A piece of chicken here, a piece of bread there..it adds up!|`|X6as2nOAaa	If you eat their food I think it is fine, waste not want not.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	Yep, sometimes I do that.  If not, compost!
788a038f5541dbc6f3da4714cefecd6caa	LOL It is a good question, and it is very true. Most babies HATE the idea of tummy time and love sleeping on their tummies.<br>  For my children, sleeping on they tummy helped their gas or reflux I think.<br>  I think that overall, children hate being put on their tummy when they are wide awake, maybe because they dont know how to do anything at that point. So they are forced to just look at the floor or mat or blanket that they are on. Whereas, if they are on they back they can see everything around them. <br>  Maybe? LOL|`|FdqMuufxaa	I try tummy time with my daughter who is almost 2 months, but she hates it.  She'll look at stuff unti her neck wont hold her head up anymore, then she screams!  I feel bad, but i want her to build up her strength!  She would sleep like a baby ( lol) on her tummy!! But I refuse to let her!!  |`|cTI6JAiVaa	because there comfortable on there tummies sleeping but when there awake they just wanna go and start crying from being fustrated for being in one spot|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	It's just where you put your baby down to strengthen the muscles in the neck and encourage crawling...|`|CzKrqgmgaa	My son hated tummy time until I put a roll pillow under his chest. This way he could see what was going on a little better. And he loved it when I put the foot rest up on the recliner and put him for tummy time there (with my legs on either side of him, while i was sitting in the chair). He was up off the floor and could see everything. He loved that!|`|yVvnZ4hpaa	Until they get those neck and back muscles good and strong, I think they hate tummy time because its so much work! All that effort just to lift your head to look around! Babies prefer sleeping on their tummies because its warmer by their face, they feel more secure and in doing so, go into a deeper sleep faster and longer. |`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter loves tummy time until she gets annoyed with it.  We started putting her on her tummy when she started trying to roll over at 4 weeks.  After the 5th week she was rolling over both ways.  She will enjoy being on her tummy now only when she thinks shes doing what she wants soon as she realizes what shes trying to do isnt working (atm its crawling...she wants to go and cant) she cries and turns over lol. <br>  <br>  For some babies it could be that they cannot see you...Ive heard that if they cannot see something or someone for that time, they dont exsist.  So for some maybe they think that being on thier tummy makes thier caretakers go poof.  We will honestly never know but just throwing out some ideas :)|`|siDcjgJCaa	I think my daughter hates it because she cant see everything going on. She like to be sitting the most so she can see what everyone is doing.. |`|awRNr2VMaa	hmm thats a good question my son was like that until 2 or 3 months i guess its because they cant see anything but the floor. my son hated sleeping on his stomach until about 2 months anyway
1c32b2a7f08aa2dc2fd8c1ccbe87d1c6aa	Size 1 - 3-4 packs<br>  Size 2 - 6-8 packs<br>  Size 3 - 10+<br>  Size 4 - 10+<br>  <br>  It honestly depends on how big your baby is when he/she is born.<br>  Smaller babies need newborn sizes bigger babies will usually go right into size 1.<br>  |`|9eno55hCaa	I would only buy a couple of each of the smaller sizes to start out and worry about the more expensive larger sizes for later.   It also depends on when your baby is really born. My daughter was a premie.  Shes now 9 weeks old and shes still in newborn sizes. She can be in those till 11lbs and shes just barely 8lbs lol sooo I got a while yet with these I think :)<br>  <br>  It really does depend on the baby and I would really try to focus just on the larger more expensive sizes to be honest. |`|gfohoYOyaa	That's really hard to say because you don't know how fast or slow your baby is going to grow and you wouldn't want to waste your money buying too many diapers.  Try buying at places that offer coupons...I think Babies R Us offers something like that and I know Target sometimes puts them on sale.  Also, try out various brands...more expensive is not necessarily better.  It all depends on your baby.  Unfortunately, I think this is an area that you have to learn as you go as its difficult to know your baby before he/she is here.|`|q3i4oUhraa	Don't buy too many of the newborn. They grow out of them SO FAST. I would buy a lot of size two and three. They tend to stay in those sizes the most. Generally kids are beginning the potty training process at about size four or five (just to give you an idea)|`|W8hvEmFlaa	You'll go through about 50-70 diapers a week so do your own math. :)  Good luck with the baby from a new daddy.|`|Zl3EzJ9taa	well the baby is going to be pooping alot so a pretty good amount|`|c2uEs18eaa	Buy several boxes of each size... you will use hundreds.|`|mwLKdEmiaa	ask ur gp|`|FDnWgAgDaa	For starters... if ur going to buy newborn size just buy 1-2 packets b/s they grow out of that really quick. size 1 probably like 2 boxes and size 2 around 3-4. Your more than likely are going to need more than that but ur doing this to save money so just go with the flow. Babies grow at different rates so no one can tell u how many u will exactly need and u wouldn't want to buy more than needed right? So just buy a little and then wait and see. Hope it helps.  = )  |`|FbcFcf4oaa	Diapers are always on sale, why spend money now, put the money on the side for diapers.  Babies use lots and lots of diapers, its amazing! to figure out which sizes to get is just a headache! |`|EI4pXpjaaa	You can buy them in sizes like 1-2 in large quantity. They are usually like $20 at walmart. Since you may not know what size your baby wears it would be more convenient to buy them in these sizes.|`|4O7yEP3naa	skip newborn diapers.... and if you do buy some.... just one pack.  Get at least 4 packs of size 1's..... and then 8 packs of 2's.  |`|QQ4goobWaa	It was nice stocked up on diapers.  We didn't buy any for months. <br>  <br>  My son was rather large, so he wasn't in size 1 very long and we still have some left. |`|2WWcC4FWaa	its always safer to buy more bigger like size 1 diapers than to have diapers that are too small|`|AA10622511	If cost is an issue, you could look into cloth.  I started to save money, but I would never go back to disposables!|`|wSPZg6Ukaa	buy millions!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	it all depends on the shape and size of your baby....some don't wear nb at all, my gal is llong and slim and she wore them for probly a month at least, lol; she's been in size one since and is four mos tom....and has plenty of room to go...just make sure that wherever you buy them will let you swap sizes after their return period is up..walmart should, and our babies r us lets you...gl<br>  don't buy too many unless you already know what brand you like<br>  i love swaddlers and won't buy anything else, huggies leaked for me...everyone is different though....|`|mCbe2a67aa	I have a 5 month old... Here is the break-down of his diaper use thus far...<br>  <br>  0-3 weeks- Newborn Pampers Swaddlers, 10 a day<br>  3 weeks- 7 weeks - Pampers Baby Dry Size 1- still around 10 a day<br>  7 weeks- 20 weeks (present)- Pampers Baby Dry Size 2, 6-8 a day<br>  <br>  But that is based on his growth. All babies are different.|`|AA11226298	Will you be using disposables or cloth?<br>  There are seven sizes of disposable diapers, from Newborn up to size 6.  I suggest you buy several packs of Newborns and size 1 to start with, because you will be using a lot.  Newborn babies go through at least 10 to 12 diapers a day.|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Not too many of the newborn size.  They grow out of those really fast.  Of course, you probably won't have a 10.5 pound-er like I did.  <br>  <br>  Even still, a couple of big packs of those will probably do ya.  They take a lot longer to grow out of the size one's and two's. <br>  <br>   You could stock up on those without fearing you've overdone it.  My daughter never got out of size three before she was potty trained.|`|wBpennsMaa	I personally only buy one pack of each size, people buy me packs as well. But you never know what sizes and how many you will need.|`|ReV6Cj06aa	that is a very good question.  for size one and two i'd only get 2-3 large packs.  3 and 4s up to ten 
9eno55hCaa	Thrown a couple of co-ed baby showers for friends lol<br>  <br>  Have a diaper changing race with the new daddy to be  (that one is usually a riot)<br>  <br>  depending on how big the place is or outside we did a game once where you had to carry the baby (a doll) and a bag of groceries (bag with presents and one hard boiled egg) around different things. If the egg survived without a crack you got a candle.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	Put juice in a a number of baby bottles (how ever many ppl you want to play) and fill them up to an oz.

rdGQMSyjaa	I'm actually a big fan of it. I think one middle name is usually "fine", but I love the idea of two. I don't have two middle names, but I wouldn't mind if I did. I'm not exactly sure how common it is, so I can't help you much there, but I do know it isn't rare. A few of my favorites on my list have two middle names.Lillian Taylor Estelle Brown is very pretty! I like it! I don't care for Bailey or Marie, but puting that aside, I think Bailey Jean Marie flows well and overall, does sound quite nice. <br>  <br>  =)|`|5vtVsqx6aa	Well, I don't like 2 middle names, but maybe that's because it's not common where I am from. <br>  <br>  To me, it sounds kind of ...... rural - to put it nicely. <br>  <br>  But that's okay if that's what you like, I guess.<br>  <br>  I just think it's kinda long. The only reason I'd give 2 middle names would be because both were extremely meaningful to me and I wanted to use both and I knew I wouldn't have any other children to give the name to.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion|`|Lg6nA574aa	I say two middle names are NOT something u see evry day but i like it because it gives something unique about ur baby expecially since my lil sister has two middle names. I like Bailey Jean Marie Brown better than Lillian Taylor Estelle Brown from my opion by the way =]|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I think 2 middle names is fine!  I think Taylor- Estelle may be to much <br>  Not common where I come from<br>  No I don't have 2 middle names<br>  Just remember your child has to have that name for the rest of their life and write it forever|`|dn00Yw3taa	I think it's perfectly fine!  I'm considering giving my children 2 middle names as well.  I have a cousin with 2 middle names.  It might be a little confusing at times, but as another person said, you don't use your middle name that much anyway. I think as long as it's a beautiful name that you love go for it!  I'm in love with Grace Victoria Rose for a girl.|`|P9S5wlLyaa	My brother is Bryan Adam John, named after both my grandfathers, and Bryan Adams. He goes by Adam. That's important to remember: the name you want to call your child does not have to go first. You can put them in whatever order they sound best, and then call your child by a middle name.|`|4FQKWxB9aa	I like just Lillian Taylor... I answered your other question.<br>  <br>  I think two middle names are okay if one is short & they sound good together, Taylor Estelle just doesn't sound good together....<br>  <br>  It's not common among people I know & no Everyone in my family has one middle name...|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I only have one, and it's not too common where I'm from, but there's certainly nothing wrong with it! In fact, I love the combos you listed inyour question. Esprcially "Jean Marie". It has a ring to it!|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	It's okay to have 2 middle names but really, you never even use your middle name when you have just one so having 2 wouldn't be any different...|`|ukI1ZMhXaa	Mina Alanna-Nneka Sari Dorsey<br>  <br>  ^^That's my name.|`|R1cey1Evaa	I have 2 middle names, and so does my mom and so will my future daughter(s)|`|xmmpqySUaa	I like it !|`|NqWl2qlPaa	I think that two middle names is a lot for a child to learn.  I have a ten year old that has two middle names and she hates it.  Also when filling out online forms that require a middle name, you usually can't fit it all in the space provided. If you are stuck on two names you can't choose from, then put them together as one in some way.  For example Taylest or Jemarie or Marjean.  This is helpful if you are in disagreement with a spouse or family member because you compromise by using both without overwhelming the child.  It also gives you the opportunity to be unique in naming your child.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	M son has 2 middle names, and so will our future children. Its your personal choice no one elses. My childrens middle names are family names. My son is called Benjamin, his middle names are Jamie and Alan after my partner and Dad. As long as they flow it shouldn't matter.<br>  I like Lillian Estelle Taylor Brown. <br>  Good luck!|`|eJMIazhLaa	I don't think that Lillian Taylor Estelle Brown is bad.  I'm not much of a fan of Bailey Jean Marie Brown.  I have a neice that has two middle names.  Her parents only use her first middle name if they say it at all so I don't really understand having two.  I don't see anything wrong with it though.  Hope I helped!|`|AA12116167	I really like two middle names. I agree though, you will hardly ever use them. It sounds more elite to have two middle names in my opinion. Like the upper class from a long time ago when the names just didn't end....|`|fPuZGkmsaa	Although giving two names would make the decision much easier I think that it is a little much.|`|PUdWfF0yaa	I think if you want to give your child two middle names, that totally your call. My mother did that with several of her children. So go for it.|`|9LwWUbYeaa	lillian estelle and bailey marie<br>  but i think bailey jean marie brown is a bit too long winded|`|794eeb906c2eeff6ec45d9217ea0ebaeaa	It's common; Just keep it a min. The names are nice I like Lillian Taylor.|`|QJf2XNaTaa	My parents named 2/4 of their kids w/ second middle names.. I think that it is good but within limits.|`|D6arttkTaa	i think its ok but it will be alot for your child to learn   i personally like lillian estelle better|`|MW1yrHbOaa	i personally do not like 2 middle names. <br>  Lillian Taylor Estelle sounds cute, but i don't think Bailey Jean Marie flows well|`|AA11603468	It's a mouthful.. and people really don't use their middle names, except for in formal documents, etc. I like Bailey, but not Bailey Brown.

0zWJlNi1aa	I think the best thing to do is go on Jeremy Kyle|`|GUuFKaaiaa	no cuz it would just put u in more trouble... i forgot about all that other stuff......|`|1NO10YfPaa	If you are abused, you don't say how which leads me to think this is mostly something you made up; but, I am going to tell you this: unless it is a life threatening situation, running away from home is absolutely the worst possible thing you can do.  Ending up in a Foster Home would be about the best way that one could end up because a 13 year old is still a child and cannot take care of herself no matter how capable she thinks she is.  Run away from home, etc. and end up pregnant, with aids, dead...  Good chance these things will happen.<br>  <br>  Run away from home, have sex, and your aunt will see you as a problem child that she wants to keep away from her children.<br>  <br>  Keep on trying to get help from a social worker, the police, etc. if you truly are abused.  Otherwise be a good girl.|`|gG8oyymiaa	They won't do a passport for you without your mothers permission. Running away can be very dangerous hun. And don't you dare start spreading your legs to leave! Have some morals in yourself. You are a young lady and you need to act like one. You where given a brain for a reason. So use it!!!!|`|d7kGopYxaa	Don't run away. Call your cousin, tell whats going on. He/she will probally say i ahve to talk to ur parents but ask if u can stay at the house when they are talking.|`|2OO9U8o9aa	Lots of 13 year old have the same issues as you appear to have with your mother and yes some do indeed run away . However sometimes they do run out of the frying pan into the fire and it is a dangerous world out there <br>  A lot depends on just what the problems are with your mother and you really need to think through what these are and perhaps talk to her about them <br>  It is possible that you could be adopted by your aunt , but that needs consent of your mother and obviously your aunt . It will be a fairly extensive legal issue and also involve Australian immigration <br>  If you do run away the chances are you will be found and brought back and if you continue to do this you could end up in care , also something you do not want . You need to confront your issues with your mother , but do it calmly and with some thought <br>  What I would say is that if you are being ill treated at home then contact child line and they will help|`|QITDf0IEaa	Stop being such an attention seeker. Grow up you're behaving like an immature brat, You're not the first 13 year old to not get along with their family. It happens to us all at some point. <br>  You are not in danger at home, you're just a moody teen. <br>  NO you will not get to move to another country just because you want to. That's just foolish thinking<br>  <br>  Don't have sex with a random guy. You're too young it will mess you up.<br>  <br>  Try harder to get along with your family, stop dreaming about moving across the world and if you're still desperate to get away from your family you'll be put into care/foster home. Now think, is that better or worse than living with your own parents.|`|dUgL2DQnaa	haha no 13 year old says half anymore thats like what little kids say lol<br>  <br>  <br>  i would tell your aunt and cousins maybe they could help you<br>  if your mom gets mad at you for that and abuses you more its time to stop taking this **** and call the police|`|0UAIBW53aa	I do not think running away is a very good idea, but you should find someone you trust to help you out. If your being abused you need to find someone who can help you! You do not deserve that at all!|`|02ouBqEdaa	do not run away if you do not want the police involved.what you can do is call your cuz and tell her what is going on|`|QAmgy7oXaa	Dont run away the best thing to do is to just pore your heart out to that person and tell them your story's and it will help alot.|`|u3LYyVOMaa	NO NO NO don't do that it doesn't matter if you have no relatives stay|`|RvB0Xd7Haa	well first tell your cousin how u feel and how much you want to live with her if she says ok then get a visa to live in australia if u don't have a british passport they usually only take a couple of week to get (mine took 4 days) this is as long as you have had a previous passport. and if none of that works out see if u can get a foster home don't just run away from home and live on the streets because theres a large chance at your age ud get attacked or die by starvation or some disease <br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|UU1g3cpxaa	Wow hunny. Dont run away. They only out come of that is going to be you in trouble.13 years old and dealing with alot I am sorry. I delt with so much when I was your age now I am 18.Does your aunt in australia know what you are being put through? DO NOT LIVE WITH A MAN. you are young.. and men are cruel when it comes to 13 year olds. Do not have sex you could catch diseases. Look at the world it happens all the time. Wait till you are maried and its special. Its hard to get a passsport for anywhere without your parents consent, becaue you are only 13. try to talk to your aunt.|`|icUCVqn6aa	your to young dont leave and dont have SEX I MEAN IT DONT YOULL REGREAT IT|`|h6dsYbkUaa	If you want to live with your aunt in Australia you will have to get her help to do so. Have you talked to her and told her your situation, that you're being abused?<br>  <br>  Running away from home is not a very good idea. If you are 13 and a half you should know that there are lots of guys out there that will take advantage of you and even hurt or kill you. Sex is a very sacred and special thing. Keep it that way. <br>  <br>  Talk to your aunt. Talk to your teachers. Talk to people that care about you. We all need help sometimes. Accept help from the people around you.|`|hVZ1EBVfaa	Grow Up, pretending to be a kid. What you want some people out there to freak OUT thinking you are actualy a kid..

Right a "Kid" requesting a passport.. you wont get it.<br>  <br>  Look Dont waste our time, if you are "Really a kid" in this abusive situation, Then contact police/social services, media etc, have an open investigation done, they will remove you temporarily from the home, until the investigation is done.<br>  <br>  And about your "Teacher" telling the Police..

sHk1Tdmqaa	Generally you can have egg like cm for several days or less.  You did the best at your timing, but using you bbt to verify when you ovulated would help narrow down the day.   The good thing is that egg cm is usually prior to O so your chances are good!  Good luck!  I am there with you in the chaos of baby making!|`|PZkzhI9Faa	the other answer is wrong; ovulation mucus is thin and stretchy like raw egg white.  once you first notice this sign you are going to ovulate and should "babydance" right away.  IOnce an egg is released it is "good" for 12 -24 hours.  You may have missed out!  Good luck|`|FYDw1rjlaa	You could be pregnant if you do that during ovulation. Ovulation occurs around 14 days before your period, you would have mucus discharge that is sticky white and mild cramps. I have that happen to be and I was pregnant.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	As ovulation approaches, your cervical mucus (sometimes abbreviated on BBT charts as CM) changes from a consistency not-so-kind to sperm, to a more fertile variety that sperm can survive and swim through better. Right after ovulation, the cervical mucus changes back to the less fertile kind.<br>  <br>  While everyone's body is different, the general changes that cervical mucus go through are dry or sticky, to creamy, to wet, to a raw egg white consistency, and then, back to dry and sticky.<br>  <br>  When your cervical mucus is in the wet or egg white consistency stage, ovulation is approaching. This is the best time to have sex, if you want to get pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  How to Check Your Cervical Mucus:<br>  <br>  First, wash and dry your hands well.<br>  <br>  Find a comfortable position, either by sitting on the toilet, squatting, or standing up and putting one leg up on the bathtub edge or toilet seat.<br>  <br>  Reach one finger inside your vagina; your index or middle finger is probably best. (Be careful not to scratch yourself.) Depending on how much cervical mucus you're producing, you may not need to reach so far, but getting a sample from near your cervix is ideal.<br>  <br>  Remove your finger from your vagina and observe the consistency of whatever mucus you find. Do this by both looking at the mucus and rolling what you find between two fingers (usually your thumb and index finger). Also, try pressing your fingers together and then slowly moving them apart. <br>  <br>  If what you find seems sticky, or findings are scant, you're probably not ovulating yet. <br>  <br>  If what you find is creamy, ovulation may be coming, but not just yet. <br>  <br>  If what you find is wet, watery, and slightly stretchy, ovulation is very likely close. Find time for some baby-making sex. <br>  <br>  If what you find is very wet, stretches between your fingers for an inch or more, and resembles raw egg white, your cervical mucus is very fertile. Ovulation is right around the corner, and now is the ideal time for intercourse.<br>  <br>  If you are charting your BBT, you should mark down on your chart your cervical mucus findings. Abbreviations often used are S for sticky, C for creamy, W for wet, and EW for egg-white cervical mucus.|`|BaXruEcqaa	Well, I noticed my ewcm yesterday while at work.  And I BD later that night.  So I hope it was the right time.  I think you did it in time.|`|vYWPvMkcaa	Not everyone will see the mucus, but you are one of the lucky ones! Do you do the OPK's? (ovulation predictor kits) If so, that will give you a 24-48 hr window of when you are most fertile. Those work really well for me, but everyone has their own way of detecting ovulation. So, to answer your question... Once you see mucus you probably are ovulating or about to. You basically have 1-3 days to baby dance!!!
sz5J9V6aaa	Well if thats your best, I suppose not, but they'd expect a bit higher.<br>  Like, I'm 13, and my parents kill me if I get below 80. I got 68 in Maths (I have the worst possible teacher, but I get like 90's and 100 in class tests) and 76 in English (Misread the question worth a lot of marks)  and I got given out to.<br>  <br>  Try harder, and seriously, p.e. isn't that hard!|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	Well those aren't the best grades but they certainly aren't the worst (except maybe the 55 in gym.) <br>  <br>  I'm not going to criticize you because I got a 65 in math and a 75 in science last term (those are my worst subjects though). I would suggest getting some tutoring and/or working harder at your subjects to boost your grades. <br>  <br>  Your parents (if they are the kind that worry about this kind of thing) may be disappointed. They do have a reason to be since you did not get a single A. Either way you should try to boost up your grades a bit..at least into the 80s. <br>  <br>  No matter what they say, remember that your grades don't say anything about your success, nor do they say you are dumb. They just say you need to work a bit harder. <br>  <br>  Best wishes with your studies!!|`|ylg9ejceaa	I assume these scores are out of 100% ???? If so it looks like you are on average consistant in all of your classes (expect gym). If this is typical grades for you, I dont think they'll be mad. If you were a A student and have dropped down to this, then thats reason to be mad. If my son got that, I'd be concerned, but he's never been low before. The only area I see of concern is gym. How can someone get so low in gym? All you need to do is particiapte. It doesnt matter if you are athletic or not, you just need to participate and show some effort.|`|LSkeAPBIaa	yesss i got a 94 gpa last quarter and my parents still gave me crap for getting a 78 on my us history mid term. i got a 94 that quarter for the class and a 95 the last. you must be really pathetic if you fail gym.|`|7wsYl1Gjaa	They probably won't be thrilled, especially about the math one.  Your other ones are pretty consistent.  Just do your best, so that you can say you did.|`|vR6AwIppaa	yeah i really do think they'll be mad.<br>  how the **** do you fail gym? seriously. wear your god dayum uniform.<br>  <br>  my parents would be pissed.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	gym grade maybe lol the other grades you got are ok. everyone cant get an A but thats fine|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	how does one fail gym|`|CrZxYK5raa	ok my parents would KILL me if i had one 70 you have like all "C's " good luck telling them. all i no is that i would be a lot of trouble and they would react badly but my best friend her parents don't care about grades so its all up to your parents.|`|Ds2pTMyzaa	It doesn't matter what grades you get if your parents are good parents they won't blame you for getting bad grades and just accept the grades you got (if they react badly just tell them it could have been worse)<br>  Spaniel luver7|`|QJf2XNaTaa	depends on your parents.|`|sT19s1l2aa	no ****..|`|AA11327039	I'd be disappointed.  What are you doing in gym class, nothing?  Gym should be the easiest class to get an A in.  All you have to do is give it your best shot and try.<br>  <br>  Depends on your math level, if you're in above grade level courses, then I'd hire you a tutor to see if it helps bring your grade up, if this doesn't bring your grade up, I'd encourage you to take grade level courses.<br>  <br>  Social studies should also be another easy class.<br>  <br>  I don't know what ela and ais is......<br>  <br>  You're the computer generation so I'd be frustrated with your computer grade too.<br>  <br>  To ease your parents worries, you need to start contacting tutors and ask your parents to hire one based on your research.|`|gaXUIduMaa	Depends on what your previous grades are.<br>  A 55 in gym???  How did you manage that?  I used to get better than just just by dressing in my gym clothes.  <br>  I don't think you are going to enjoy the next few weeks stuck out at home all day.|`|yV8fog7Paa	You'd be grounded especially with that 55% in gym. You'd be grounded due to all of those classes, I'd expect at least a B or higher. <br>  <br>  I do think your parents will be angry.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	you're passing all the important stuff... I'd ask what's up with the grade in gym but wouldn't concern myself with it.. some people suck at gym and it's not fair that they fail because of that|`|tecPZUq2aa	They Are Good Grades!<br>  <br>  Not Everyone Is Born To Be Brainy!<br>  <br>  Hehe<br>  <br>  X|`|zmRfnPomaa	Idk but my mother would be furious !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
jdRKZe18aa	OK first things first - NO you can NOT spoil a sweet little new born baby at 3 months old.  She is SO little and still developing and has her own personal needs, comforts, noise tolerances, preferences etc - just like you or I.  BUT she can't tell you about them or how she feels or when she feels what - so she CRIES and fusses, gets irritated and might be overly sensitive at 3 months to many new things in her surroundings.  Remember she's been in a warm, silent, rocking WOMB for 9 months...this loud, cold, cranky WORLD must SUCK to little new borns in many ways.<br>  <br>  Think about it - when you aren't comfortable and need to sit or lay or be in a different position or SEE a new thing in your surroundings or readjust your body -  you just DO IT.  She can't - she relies solely on you for ALL her needs and desires and comforts etc.   You two just need to find a personal communication technique and you will develop that as you and she get to know eachother better with every passing day.  Just try NEW things, be creative, try music, DON'T whatever you do isolate her in quiet soundless places & rooms and expect the household to HUSH for her.  SHE will adjust to the moderate noise levels of life and your home and much of that will be like WHITE NOISE for her and actually HELP calm & soothe her if you don't shield her from it.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry and this IS THE AGE to give her all the spoiling, loving, holding, coddling you can give her.  She won't be at spoilable age until she is at least 12 months old in my opinion.  (I've raised 4)|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Personally I think they can be spoiled at any age.  When you have to stop doing something every 5 seconds to calm your crying baby, then yes, I would say that baby is spoiled.  When you have to leave chores undone all day because your baby will fuss all day other wise, then yes I think that is spoiled.  <br>  <br>  All that being said, I believe I am guilty.  My baby comes to work with me, and the second she starts to cry I HAVE to pick her up because we spend 90 percent of our time on the phone here at work.   My baby is only 12 weeks old and is already hip to the fact that I have to do that.  I know this because when we get home, she continues with this behavior, however, if I don't pick her up immediately at home, she doesn't scream near as loud as she does if I don't pick her up at work.<br>  Babies aren't as dumb as people make them out to be! lol!<br>  <br>  My answer, yes, they can be spoiled.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	No, you can't spoil an infant.  Your baby is doing what babies do and all you can do is say screw the house work and hold your baby.  She wants you to hold her and as far as I'm concerned that's what you do.  It's your only job. Soon she won't want you to hold her so cherish the moment|`|E5CnUdhsaa	no i dont think they can. babies are fussy some babies arent...very normal for a baby to decide that nothing you do is right and theres no way you can console them. my daughter is 15 months and still has those days. its come to th epoint where im ok leaving the vacuuming and washing when shes settled|`|66KUgS24aa	no,<br>  babies only have needs<br>  not wants<br>  maybe a bigger kid could get a little bratty...but they are still learning how to control their emotions<br>  and us parents shouldn't be to hard on them less they be suppressed into becoming themselves.|`|AA10888290	In a word, no.  She will grow out of it, so just be patient and realize these are all new experiences to her.  Her memory isn't so great right now, so she wants what she wants when she wants it.  Just go with it.|`|L6U1joGAaa	I don't believe it is possible to spoil a baby that young. They are only that age for a short period of time and you should hold them and give them all the attention you can then because trust me once they are old enough to walk they don't want your attention as much. The more love and attention you give them the more love and attention they will give later in life. As far as the being fussy goes. If your busy letting her cry for a little wont hurt her. You know the difference between a cry when she's hurt or a cry when she's just wanting to be entertained. You don't have to jump to those ones.|`|1Hq4vC8Jaa	I went through the same thing with my son who just turned 9 months. I thought I had spoiled him to the point of no return, and had people tell me that I needed to just let him cry. I never did. I used my own judgment and instincts and in the end he won lol. I realized that all the house work, the laundry, the dishes, dinner, they were all going to be there tomorrow and the next day and the day after that, but my baby wasn't going to be a baby forever and one day I was going to look back and wish that instead of doing the dishes, I would have held him and played with him. So I say do what you feel is right, and just remember that everything will be there for you to do another time but all too soon your baby will be going off to college before you know it.  Just relax, in a few months all she is going to want to do is crawl around and not want to be held so much or require so much attention.If you do get too frustrated then by all means but her in a crib, bassinet or ask some one to watch her  and take 10 minutes away from her if she cries it's ok. I had to do it a couple of times myself. Don't feel bad if you have to, and once you go back in to get her you will be amazed at how much it helped. As far as the spoiling thing goes, I asked my pediatrician the same question and he reassured me I had nothing to worry about. As for the studying, try a sling or a baby back pack. It may just be that she wants to be close to you. It may be a little difficult but at least you will hopefully get a little study time in.  Hope I helped you some.|`|deIzFnV8aa	I have read several places that the first 3 months are considered the "fourth trimester", where you really can't spoil a baby or teach her bad habits. However, 3 months is when many sites suggest you start encouraging "good habits", such as bedtime routines, not being fed to sleep, etc. I have also heard 3 months cited as that age at which babies begin "intentional crying" - they can cry because they are confused or upset about something in addition to wanting a basic need met. I would say that your daughter is just getting old enough to get the connection between her crying and what you do for her as a result.  Solutions are harder, of course :P  With our DD I would put her in something portable (like a bouncy chair, she is kind of heavy to "wear" for very long!), and try to involve her in things I did by talking to her while I did them and letting her play with something special depending on what we were doing (like a clean spoon in the kitchen). She was pretty good about being distracted by new "toys", so for us it turned out not to be that hard.<br>  <br>  Your daughter is getting to the age of more independent play and is ready for an activity gym (and soon a jumper/exersaucer).   Our DD can entertain herself in either one of the former for about 20 minutes with light supervision, so I can get things done nearby.  That kind of aviods the fussy problem w/o solving it.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	My son is the same, he's 5 months old. He will only sit or play for 5-10 minutes maximum. I have every toy out there, but none of them keep his attention for longer than that. He likes what he likes, and right now its me. He constantly wants to be held or looked at. Its frustrating, because you can't do anything, I know, my eldest son did the very same thing, so I'm broken in now. You know, before you know it they will be grown out of this stage so don't worry. The only one suggestion I do have is try a baby Einstein, I put one on last week for my son and he actually watched it from start to finish. Good luck|`|w3ob12X6aa	people say that its to young to be spoiled but i dont know because my daughter is the same age and she really likes watching tv and she will be perfectly fine and the minute i walk in front of the tv or pass her to where she can see me she will scream and cry, then i pick her up and she fine again so maybe|`|wvzQObahaa	you can't spoil a 3 months baby ! as far as i know ,spoiling starts at 9 months ..but till then , you should attend to all your child's needs ..<br>  in that way ,you are building trusting relationship between the two of you !<br>  i don't know if other moms feel the same ,but when ever i was tensed or irritated ,my baby girl reflected the same feelings ,she got fussy and cried ..it seemed to me like babies can sense what we are feeling !!!!!!!!<br>  so keep a smile on your face and hang on ..stages pass so quickly ,only yesterday  my girl was a newborn!!!<br>  best of luck|`|PkWX9Ouwaa	I firmly believe that our son is spoiled because he loves to be held.  He sleeps better when and longer when he is held.  My only advice is to hang in there and be patient because our sons likes and dislikes change pretty fast.|`|mAxChwHTaa	she is probably uncomfortable...|`|g7r4W2vRaa	she is only 3 months old so right now she is relying on you to help her get comfortable and to do everything for her. When she gets older and realizes that she can do some things for her self it will get easier. Right now just try to be there for her and in a couple of months she will be doing a lot more movements for herself. <br>  <br>  NO 3 month olds can not be spoiled so don't think you are. They need their moms because they can't do things for themselves yet.|`|iU5EzYUMaa	There is NO way to spoil your 3 month old. She just needs you and depends on you and the only way to communicate is to cry. <br>  <br>  My life changed when I bought the Ergo Carrier. You can start at 3 months and it grows with your baby. I just put my son in it and I was handsfree to do anything i needed. It will help build the bond between you and your baby as well as put her in soothing position close to your heart and your scent.<br>  <br>  And at the end of the day... don't worry. The fussyness will subside once she is old enough to discover the world on her own. Give it a few more months and you will enjoy every sound and coo she makes.<br>  <br>  In the meantime... enjoy every moment even in the most stressed times. She is only 3 months once and I miss that time terribly!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
c3d9621b66bbf4d52837a662d4822489aa	You can do the following to "help":<br>  <br>  -Keep upright for at least 30mins<br>  -Feed less but more frequently<br>  -Have him see the doctor for acid reflux<br>  -Add 1tsp of cereal per 2oz of formula (if doc approves)<br>  -Burp all you can burp<br>  <br>  However, sometimes there is nothing you can do. It just becomes a laundry problem. To help with the mess, use receiving blankets rather than burp clothes. It covers more area and saves on the laundry load a bit. He may just have to outgrow it.<br>  <br>  EDIT - We tried Nutramigen...but it did no difference for us. Since we aren't on WIC, and it didn't do any difference we switched back to Isomil. My daughter does have an actual milk allergy though..so maybe that is why it didn't work as good??? Talk to your doctor..but it's worth a try. Most ppl swear by this formula! Or the Similac form of it Alimentum (??). My daughter had alot of things playing against her...colic, acid reflux, milk allergy. She just had to somewhat outgrown it. She made a year on Monday and is still on Zantac. Up until about 2mths ago, nothing stopped the spitting up...everything just keep it to a minimum.|`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter is a premie as well.  We have to give her small amounts of formula at a time when we give her formula (she mostly gets breastmilk but its still in a bottle).  We give her one ounce at a time and burp her in between each ounce.  If we dont she spits up, this is what our home nurse suggested (she comes ot the house to check on our daughter a lot and as often as I need her to).|`|KUxEBQuYaa	make sure you burp him really good. my son was a preemie. and when i feed him i have to burp him once and then wait and move him around and try to burp him again. sometimes you don't get all the air out in the first burp. give that a try and see how he is. good luck|`|4lHJEq5Haa	most likely he suffers from acid reflux. His mother should be taking him to the doctor. Infant zantac can provide a great amount of relief for spitting up excessively. |`|UidT5jbwaa	My daughter was born 8 weeks early and she is on NeoSure by similac. The doctor told us that preemies especially have problems stopping eating when they are full. They will continue to eat even if full. The baby could be overeating. Feed the baby less ounces and burp the baby really well. Hope it helps!|`|a88c35ef9c55d87377ccb9c18365cc44aa	I have a preemie and he hasnt really had a problem with spit up. I use the Parents Choice milk based formula from Wal-mart. Enfamil Lipil made him constipated and gave him gas. I found that the Wal-mart brand actually works the best with him. I think giving a child soy based formula is not good, unless they have a milk allergy. It has been proven that with soy formula boys reach sexual maturity later in life and girls get their mentral cycle earlier. My son was bigger than him at birth (4lbs 4.5oz). He has been on this formula since 3 1/2 months.  |`|JI7NQ9TNaa	They put my daughter on soy---and she was allergic to that, not the regular formula.<br>  <br>  You need to get him to a doctor dear...
kdu80NXzaa	Yes it can, you are going through what thousands of other women go through (1 in 6). Some women get it up to 2 years after birth!<br>  You need to talk to someone, anyone who knows anything about post natal/partum depression will not think badly of you and you should ignore any negative comments you get. I have a very close friend who has battled this for 5 plus years over 2 babies and very close to suicide, she finally told her friends and family what she was feeling and is really close to recovery. Don't try to do everything, you cannot be super woman, go and talk to someone that can really help you.<br>  I wish you all the best sweetheart.|`|YmEGCGtnaa	i dont feel like i'm scum exactly, but I am a very insecure young woman and if anyone says ANYTHING at all that even slightly hints I'm incompetant, like criticizes how I feed or hold my baby, I get all nervous and start to feel inadequate. I guess its anxiety what I have. I also sometimes have fears that my bf will leave me and take my daughter with him and some1 else will be the mom. i however have diagnsoed obsessive compulsive disorder where I have obsessive thoughts over things happening.|`|vdPP87Q8aa	yes, sometimes i'd get so down in the dumps, i would start thinking that. i have a 9 month old as well and he is the world to me. the way i see it is that he was given to YOU and not anyone else. if he wasn't meant to be with you, you wouldn't have been so blessed to have him with you now. :) you know. raising my son on my own at 17 is hard as hell let me tell you, but what always brightens my day is when i know i can come home to a smiling face that can always cheer me up! sometimes when i'm down in the dumps, and i start thinking, what is he doing with me? he deserves someone so much better than me. he deserves to have the best mother in the world! so, why of all people in the world is he with me? those questions run through my head over and over again and then i look down at his smiling face and it all becomes clear... :)|`|pRbx4Y5Waa	NO!  Please don't say those things.  You're baby needs YOU, his mother.  I am a new mom and I would sit and cry and look at my daughter and think how perfect and beautiful she is.  I would find it hard to believe that I was capable of making something so perfect.  How could I ever be a good enough mom?  The feeling of motherhood is seriously overwhelming.  It wouldn't hurt to talk to a professional about how you're feeling if it gets to be too much.  There's nothing wrong with that.  Don't let your feelings start to build a barrier between you and your beautiful son.  You ARE good enough and you're EXACTLY what he needs.  The fact that you are so concerned shows that you're a GREAT mom.  Try to start loving yourself for having created something so beautiful.  You created something that nobody else in this entire world could.  That child that is so perfect is from YOU!  Give yourself some love and credit for it and start trying to enjoy your son.  I will keep you in my prayers :-)|`|9eno55hCaa	I have the same issue as MommyToLilly.  I was diagnosed with OCD about 5 years ago.  I have had a diagnosis of Bi-Polar disorder since I was 15.

fQxSClHKaa	hey hun,<br>  as a cutter with an eating disorder (anorexia with bulimic tendencies), i know what it's like. <br>  the girl that said you have 'EDNOS' is wrong. you don't have to be underweight to have an eating disorder. you are skipping meals, and purging what you eat. that is definitely an eating disorder.<br>  my advice is to talk to someone you trust. someone who will understand.<br>  i know it would be AWFULLY hard to talk to my parents about this, which is why i chose to tell my best friend. <br>  if you want to stop cutting and purging, then here are a few tips ;<br>  when you feel the urge to cut, distract yourself. or, think of what would happen if the girls at school found out about your scars, and how awful that would be.<br>  if you want to stop purging, i would start eating lots of fruit and 'safe foods', then slowly raise your calorie intake. also, minimize bingeing, which will in turn, prevent purging. <br>  sorry if this answer isnt what you were looking for, im not too great at helping people, when i cant even take my own advice.<br>  email me if you want to talk ; kaylie.spiess.xo@hotmail.com <br>  ??|`|83Sgczl4aa	I'm so sorry it sounds like you've been through so much so young.<br>  You need to find someone you can trust maybe someone through the school and get some help i know that sounds so hard to do right now but you need to so you can get out of this time in your life. If you get to talk to a teenage counseller of some sort they'll be able to get you back on track and hopefully figure ways to make you happier. As for those girls, well they're just low lived pathetic immature little girls whos karma will catch up on them sometime or other, you want to prove to them you can be something, better yourself and show them they're wasting their time picking on you because you will just be strong and ignore it. try not to get upset over them they honestly aren't worth it and they're trying to break you down. please try to be strong and i wish you the best of luck. x|`|C6wxUt9qaa	Hey sorry to hear you're having such a tough time at a young age. <br>  Right, i have had experience of almost all of those things and i will tell, you now you need some serious professional help and good friends and supportive family members. Go to www.beat.co.uk (if this fails just type 'BEAT' into the toolbar). This will give you loads of info and help on eating disorders, you def have one. You not be 'a bulimic' as you have to be a certain weight and normally loss of periods etc to be medically bulimic, but you do have EDNOS 'Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified'. You need to be honest with your parents (i wasnt and did it on my own) I found it easier that way, but its just me, i  alo had no help from friends. <br>  See your gp, you may be depressed, need some form of counselling. You should get rid of all sharp implements or anything you use to self harm as this will mean you go cold turkey (i was a continuous self harmer from 13-18 and it was no fun at all, i had to do the above, it can be done) you dont ppl noticing as this can be a bad thing, particuly in your age group, you can actully be taken into foster care until you sort yourself out, but it will most likely increase bullying you are getting as ppl see self harm as 'attention seeking' which is not. You are crying out for help as i can see. <br>  Visit the website, call numbers,see your gp, talk to parents if you can,hide you self harming things as this will mean you cannot and really focus in on controlling your eating habits-but in a postive way. stay downstairs for as long as possible so you do not get need a toilet, of course you'll screw up now and then, its not great but try really hard. I know how hard it is trust me!!! <br>  you can always mail if you like???? dizzylittlething@yahoo.co.uk<br>  Take care hun one step at a time xxx|`|KaDuWf0Qaa	Tell your mom. She will help you. No one wants their daughter to be so upset. If she decided to take you to a therapist, go and cooperate. A lot of people don't like to talk about that, but you need to, or else you'll just keep going like this.|`|f1lpdiNEaa	I think you should start by booking an appointment with your doctor. It will be in confidence and they can help in diagnosing your bullemia and finding a counsellor for you. If you can tell her, you should confide in your mum. Maybe she could go with you? Honestly you'll feel like a big weight is off your shoulders once you've told her. All your mum will want to do is help you, but she can't help til you tell her what's wrong,<br>  <br>  I really think counselling will help you cope with the things that happened in your past and how to cope at school.<br>  <br>  You, or you and your mum should also try and speak to a teacher you trust and feel comfortable with at school and get help tackling your bullies. <br>  <br>  Please don't let anyone at school bring you down and make you feel low. Especially don't let them ruin your education. Trust me they are not worth it.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is try and tackle these problems, get a good education and concentrate on a healthier, happier future. The bullies are likely to end up very sad and doing nothing with their lives!<br>  <br>  Take it one step at a time and start by sharing your problems with someone, then everything else will fall into place in good time. Good luck.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	I am just wondering...in some of your other questions you mentioned that 3 or 4 years ago you recovered from bulimia, that it was so horrible you were hospitalized? So that means you had bulimia when you were 10 years old? Some of the stuff you tell about yourself just seems a little far fetched....<br>  <br>  You also mentioned that you're pregnant.... <br>  Oh also that you were a virgin when you got raped, however you can't be a virgin if you're already pregnant..hmm I just don't understand. Maybe you should make your questions private so no one knows you're lying.|`|vBahPYJGaa	yea that is bulimia, well it sounds like it you really need to talk to someone and tell them what is going on and about the girls that are doing that and don't commit suicide.|`|Mjni0Np3aa	you need help. you are bulimic, and you need help with that. also, the cutting is  a huge problem. talk to your parents or a counselor. Maybe switch schools if everyone is that rude to you. no one deserves that.|`|7ad5cc0b1e1e9c33fffe4554cf26af75aa	Well firstly you would be considered to have bulimia, and possibly depression. The reason you 'cut yourself' is because it releases endorphins in your body. Endorphins are hormones which reduce the sensation of pain and affect emotions. A different way to release endorphins is through small amounts of chocolate instead of cutting. It is really important that you stick it out and realize, at some point, you will find someone in you life who will be like your guardian angel. Maybe you could start  looking for answers in faith, like Catholicism or Christianity. Soon you will be going to high school and you will be open to all new friends, and opportunities. I once read a magazine about a girl who wrote on her mirror all the negative things she thought about herself, what she though were mean things, or anything bad. She wiped off all the bad things with a paper towel and replaced it with all new positive things to make her feel good. Each time she went into her room she would look at it and think of how many good qualities were and would add new ones as they come.<br>  Goodluck finding hope.|`|Xtyu4wphaa	Hey sorry to hear you're having such a tough time at a young age. <br>  Right, i have had experience of almost all of those things and i will tell, you now you need some serious professional help and good friends and supportive family members.

I used to cut a few years ago when i was 13 and it was because deep down , i wanted attention. Your not bulimic , making yourself sick is just another form of self harming. but "you sad with a blank look on your face with tears down your eyes "?? Definately wanted attention there , and OBVIOUSLY didnt want help cos otherwise you wouldnt have acted like that.<br>  <br>  You dont want to kill yourself , cos if you did , you would have already. Just get support from your friends , alot of us are in positions where are parents do really seem to care , but youve got friends and remember that ALOT od people have it alot tougher than  you . BTW if you want to stop cutting , just ping an elastic band on your arm , or sqeeze an ice cube , they help release your stress without scaring and harming you , itll all sort itself out cos you dont have it too bad , just look at what you DO have and be thankful :)
2f6diQBiaa	It's too early for implantation dip, but it's also nothing to be concerned about. Dips are really common during the luteal phase and really don't mean anything about pregnancy. The dips are related to surges in estrogen that occurs during the luteal phase in order to keep the corpus luteum (which produces progesterone and maintains the uterine lining) alive. Because the most typical time for dips is in mid-luteal phase (around 7-9dpo), they have been called "implantation dip". However, there is no scientific evidence for the dips being related to implantation and research has shown that they occur at the same rate in pregnant and non-pregnant cycles.<br>  <br>  Long answer, short: I think it's too early for it to be implantation and I think it's just a normal variation in temps.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you! I hope you get your BFP!!!|`|QFNvYVtyaa	You should ovulate 12-48 hours after the positive ovulation predictor test, and your BBTs should go up within 48 hours of ovulating. It can take up to 4-5 days to see the rise, but ideally you see it within 3.<br>  <br>  <br>  The average range of BBTs is between 97.0-97.7 before ovulation and 97.7-99.0 after ovulation. Ideally, a woman?s temperature will not bounce around more than .5 degrees in the follicular phase and will stay above the coverline during the luteal phase
rULT8Ograa	I managed to fall pregnant quickly and experienced a perfect pregnancy other than some heartburn. During the last trimester, I experienced contractions quite regularly, especially when lying down or when my bladder was full. I always had them during my checkups at the doctors and my doctor told me that I had an irritable uterus and she said that this could be a good thing as some people with an irritable uterus found that they experienced a quicker labour as their cervix was already being softened and dilated before actual labour. I ended up going into labour the day after my due date at 1am. Having experienced contractions for so long I wasn’t sure that it was actual labour but as they were coming regularly 6 minutes apart and I had a bloody show when I went to the toilet I thought that it might actually be happening. I called the hospital to let them know and they said stay home and sleep for as long as possible, take panadol and put a hot water bottle on my tummy. I tried but when it got to 3am I woke my husband up and he sat on our couch with me and played his Xbox while I timed my contractions and whined about how painful they were. By 6am they were 2 to 3 minutes apart and were really starting to hurt so let the hospital know we were on our way and called my mum to let her know what was happening too. We got to the hospital and the only way that I could deal with the pain was to keep walking around and breathing, but I was vomiting a bit and crying a lot because of the pain. Luckily, my husband stayed with me and supported me the entire time as I don’t think I could have done it without him. Our midwife came in and said that she could do an internal but as it was my first labor she wouldn't expect that I wouldn’t be dilated as I should still have a long time top go. She did the internal and was surprised to tell me that I was already 6cms. She started monitoring the baby’s heartbeat and it started dropping a bit just as the midwife was running me a bath to help with the pain. Instead of a nice warm bath, I had to lie on the bed with the heart rate monitor on which was agonizing and I was offered the gas to help with pain relief. It didn’t really help but it gave me something to focus on. I started needing to push and so I was moved to the birthing suite, crying the whole time as the contractions were coming all at once and were so painful. I gave birth to our 4.01kg baby boy  at 10:45am after 9 hours of labour, and the only pain relief I had was the gas. Unfortunately I ended up having a severe third degree tear which meant that I had to go into surgery to get repaired and the next day they found that I had lost so much blood that I needed a blood transfusion. I never got any milk and had a constantly screaming, starving child. The midwives at the hospital were awful about breastfeeding, they looked at me in disgust when i suggested that i couldnt do it, and they showed me to squish my boob into a tube and jam my babys head onto it, holding him there until he started sucking.  My nipples were bleeding and I had blood blisters on them and feeding was agony. the night we got home, the onkly way that we could settle him was for me to hold him on my boob all night so that he could constantly suck. I couldnt do it anymore, he was starving, always screaming and we were all unhappy.  I ended up having to formula feed my bubba and he was a completely different, happy baby and i could start to enjoy him. . i have struggled with the demands of having a baby, i dont believe that anything can prepare you for it, but my boy is an angel and I adore him. |`|ww3eIZiXaa	Hi there !<br>  <br>  For me, early signs of labour was cramping in my lower back, and just being restless and I was unable to sleep the night before. <br>  <br>  I went to the hospital at midnight and delivered vaginally at 3:44pm the next day. I didn't find labour overly painful, it was manageable. I had an epidural at 8 or 9 cm dialted which really took the edge off for pushing. My doctor had to break my water for me before I started pushing. I was 41 weeks pregnant when I delivered. 4 days past my due date. <br>  <br>  As soon as my baby girl came out, they put her on my chest to clean her up. It was the most amazing experience. It really leaves you speachless. I breast fed my baby a few minutes after she was born. It was so cool to see how she already knew what to do with it!! I had to spend 2 nights in the hospital after delivery then I finally got to take my little angel home. <br>  Bringing her home at first was very stressful b/c the inlaws were in from out of town, which was a major pain in the ***. Luckily they didn't stay long tho haha. I was pshychotic about people washing their hands, and I didn't want anyone to really hold her. Im alot better now a days with sharing her tho.

The I lost the feeling in my left leg making it so I couldnt move, when my husband got home he got me off the bed and tried to walk me threw the house but the pressure got worse.  So to the hospital we went I dialated 2 cm in 4 hours, and the contractions were 2 mins apart so they shipped me off to another hospital that could deal with preterm babies.  They stopped the delivery I was in the hospital for a week.  Came home then she tried to come out again two weeks later, at 34 weeks then again at 36 weeks.  So they induced me by this time 37 I experienced lots of pressure no pain until they broke my water.  <br>  <br>  I went to the hospital when they kindly booked my inducement after they canceled the first one by mistake.  I had been in a wheel chair at this point for over a month and bed ridden for 8 weeks loads of fun.<br>  <br>  <br>  What happened during labour?<br>  9 am induced nurse blew up three of  my veins talking with my coach about hair products.<br>  1pm up pitocine to magic number 90 ml per hour they promised this would work because my contractions were 10 mins apart at this point that I may have her by 6 no dialation at this point this I just wanted her out.  5 pm rolls around still not dialated so they up it to 110 <br>  7pm still no dialation OB comes in says I think well send you home I was pissed I said no way!  I wasnt going to be confined to bed for another 4 weeks so they could deliver her by c-section at her predicted weight of 14 pounds.<br>  715 nurse comes back and says we ahave one more thing to try up it to 120 ml per hour and see what happens.  OB leaves and comes back two hours later.<br>  9pm i am dialated 3.5 cm from 2 .5 that I had been for weeks OB breaks water at 930 got everything soaked<br>  <br>  12pm contraction by this point are unbearable so I get gas DOESNT DO anything (because nurse forgot to durn on the gas just sucking air for a freaking hour)  so they give me some more demoral which i had earlier to ease the pain.

I was blacking out at this point actually having mini seizures which I used to suffer from.  The nurse just told my mom I was sleeping they didnt bother to check me.  I had 5 of them.  By 4am the next morning I hadnt slept in 33 hours and passed out again they put me isolation away from my baby and people for 17 more hours trying to get me to sleep and hooked up to a whole wack load of machines so I wouldnt have anymore.  My personal nurse snuck in with the baby who hadnt beensleeping either and put her to my chest and we both finally fell asleep for three hours. <br>  I have now had a migraine for 6 weeks since her birth and I am taking painkiller just to keep the edge off. <br>  <br>  When I got home?<br>  I kept having a few seizures and massive migraine attacks,  and have very little engery for anything but my daughter.

I went in at 10am for my first and at 4pm with my second nothing really happened during labor. They gave me a little pitocin to dilate faster and then when I was around 8-9 they broke my water for me because it didnt happen (both times) and finally at 10:24pm (the first time) and 8:36pm (the second time) i had my kids. only took like 1 hr after breaking water with first and only 5 minutes after breaking water with second lol. had a few good pushes and out came my babies. lol after the birth, with the first i tore and they had to stitch me (she was a 8 lb 10 oz baby) and with the second i didnt tear but i was very sore (she was 7 lb 10 oz) I breastfed both right after delivery was done.

I was laying in bed and was having some cramps. I got up to go pee and my water broke. I told my husband that we need to go to the hospital. He told me to quit joking around. Well, finally, after he got up he took me to the hospital about 6am. When I got there, they made me walk for an hour (After not sleeping ALL night) I was exhausted. The contractions quit for awhile so my doctor induced me. I was on so much pain medication, I don't remember A lot of the day. I know I was dilated to a 2 around noon, because my cousin wanted to be there for and she decided to leave for awhile, because she didn't think any thing was going to happen.

He told me that my back pain was due to back labor.  I went home and ate some lunch and finished packing my overnight bag.  My dog got loose and I spent 45 minutes chasing him through my neighborhood.  When I arrived at the hospital they didn't have my room ready and told me to walk around the maternity ward til they were ready for me.  When the nurse checked me at 4:30pm, I was 4cm dilated.  They put a baby heart rate monitor and a contraction monitor around my belly.  They got an IV in place and started a petocin drip.  While the nurse was asking me all the standard admission questions, she stopped cold and stared at the contraction monitor.  Then she asked me how I was feeling.  I told her I was perfectly fine.  She said that I should be in some pain or at least discomfort.  When I asked her why, she said I was having a huge contraction according to the monitor.  At that point, I became very confidant that labor and delivery were going to be super easy for me.  Oh boy, was I ever wrong!!<br>  <br>  I had tested positive for strep, so they were giving me antiboitics through my IV every 4 hours.  The medicine made my arm so cold and it hurt so bad.  At 8pm I had dilated to 7cm, so the nurse called my doctor in to break my water.  Within about 30 minutes the contractions were so strong and painful, I couldn't take it anymore.  I would shake violently, my teeth were chattering, and I just wanted it to stop.  I called the nurse and told her I wanted an epidural.  It took the doctor about an hour to get there to insert the epidural.  Within 5-10 minutes of getting the epidural, I felt so much better.  The pain was gone and I was able to relax and sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  I woke up around 7am on 7 May and felt ready to push.  The doctor checked me and said that I wasn't quiet 10cm and that I should try to relax and wait a little longer.  By 10am, I was tired of being told I wasn't ready so I started pushing on my own.  My doctor came back around 10:30 and turned down my epidural so that I could feel the contractions better to know when to time my pushing.  My daughter was born at 11:24am and weighed 8lb 1oz and was 21 inches long.  She had a head full of dark brown hair, much to my surprise since I'm blond and my husband has light brown hair.  When they layed her on my belly, she looked up at me with her big blue eyes and I melted.  My mom said her name and she looked right at her and she took her picture.  After they weighed and measured her and cleaned her up, I put her to my breast and she immediately began suckling.  We never had any problems with her latching on and my milk came in later that same day.<br>  <br>  My doctor had cut me to keep me from tearing, so they kept me in the hospital for two days to make sure that I was healing properly.  We had many guests (mostly family) at the hospital, but most of our friends didn't come visit until we got home.  In all, my pregnancy and the birth of my daughter was one of the most special times in my life.  I might not be good at other things, but I know that I am a good mother.  I can see it every day when my daughter does something magical.  Now I can't wait to add to our family.  Hopefully, the fertility specialist will be able to tell me why I haven't gotten pregnant again despite trying for nearly 3 years.  My first appointment with him is this Wednesday.  Wish me luck!!|`|vdPP87Q8aa	January 18th 1:50 am. sharp pains in my stomach coming and going and i mean PAINFUL! and the more quicker they came, the more intense the pain was. i went to the hospital when i started having the pains. i actually had my son 3 months early,i was only 7 months pregnant when i had him. they tried to give me injections which were to stop the contractions, but he was coming anyways. so i didn't get to take him home the day he was born. he stayed in the hospital for about 6 weeks and then they finally released him because he was doing so well. they told me, he wasn't going to make it because of his heart and he's 9 months now!!  when i first saw my son i looked down at him and cried like a baby and still get teary eyed to this day. he was the smallest baby i had ever seen and i knew looked down at him and said to the nurse, "how can you love someone so much you just met?" she just looked at me and smiled and said welcome to the parent hood. when i got him home, i was so excited about bringing him home. i even walked him all throughout the house in his car seat when i first got home, almost like giving him a tour lol. it was wonderful! hope this answered your questions :) good luck!|`|Vad64Jjoaa	I was getting my son ready for school (luckily my hubby had taken the day off) it was about 9:00 a.m. and I started getting a cramp. So I got in the shower hoping the heat from the water would make the cramp go away. Well it didn't and I doubled over in the shower. By the time I got out I couldn't walk, so my hubby helped me get dressed. We got to the hospital and they said she was crowning. I had and Epi and she was born at 11:19 am. She was beautiful and still is. The first night we brought her home was stressfull cause you are not quite sure what to do with them and not to mention you can't sleep cause all you want to do is stare at them. But it is so worth it!|`|MEVg0LBGaa	i had a membrane sweep at 40+3, then another at 40+6.<br>  <br>  i woke up shortly after after midnight at 41 wks, abour 12hrs after my 2nd sweep, in awful pain. i had little to no braxton hicks and thought something was wrong. i called the midwife who said i was in labour. she said to take 2 paracetemol and go for a warm bath. <br>  <br>  i was pacing about till 8am, my contractions were really irregular, my water broke, but it wasnt the big gush i expected. so i went to the birthing centre i chose (midwife only led). they said they couldnt keep me there as my BP, Temp, etc were all raised indicating infection and because they had no dr present they couldnt take the chance on keeping me. i was transferred to a hospital 25miles away.<br>  <br>  my contactions were still irregular, and they gave me a tablet to reduce my BP. they were having trouble keeping a trace of my daughters heartbeat, so they attached a little wire to her head to monitir her. shortly after they took a blood sample from me which showed and infection, so the scratched my daughters head to take a sample from her, which came back showing infection too.<br>  <br>  by 10pm, i was 10cm but she had not descended right into the birth canal. due to her starting to show signs of distress and labour failing to progress, they decided on an emergency section.<br>  <br>  at 11.12pm, my daughter was born after 23 hours of labour.<br>  <br>  it turned out that when i was complaining to the midwife in the 2 weeks before birth that i felt water coming away, there was a pinhole rupture in my amniotic sac, which caused infection to me and my baby. she told me it was urine leaking due to the pressure on my bladder. both my daughter and i were on antibiotics for 5 days. my girl had to keep a venflon in which wasnt very nice and she had to be taken away to special care every 12hrs to get her antibiotics.<br>  <br>  |`|9eno55hCaa	August 4th I went in for an ultrasound and they discovered that my blood pressure was a bit high and sent me for fetal monitoring (I was 33 weeks).  Everything appeared to be fine except for my blood pressure so they sent me home, told me to rest.  4am August 5th I started having severe back pains and had some spotting (I didnt realize it then but my water had broke as well.)  I assumed it was to early for labor and thought it was braxton hicks, decided to wait it out...around 4pm that same day we decided to just go to the hospital.  Got to the hospital and was immediately put on monitors.  After 8 hours of sitting in the hospital room thinking I was going to die I begged them for an epidural.  Waiting 3 hours more when they finally came in to put in the epidural. By morning the contractions had slowed but not stopped completely...they said they would have to hold me in the hospital and hope to keep the baby in there for at least another week.  As soon as they stopped the epidural the contractions started again and they decided to induce instead.  They gave me oxytosin and had to put the epidural back in.  After a total of more than 40 hours of being in labor my daughter was finally born via vaccum (Her heartbeat was slowing to much for the doctors, and they were giving her another 2 mins to come naturally then they were going to order a c-section  Luckily we avoided that).  I was only 33 weeks along so she was really tiny under 4lbs. <br>  <br>  I didnt get to see her for more than a minute before they took her to the nicu.  Then they made me wait in the delivery room for another 4 hours before I could go to the nicu to see her.  I spent the next 4 weeks in the hospital with my daughter We were put into a room together (she was in an incubator and under a jaundice lamp during half of that time).<br>  <br>  When we finally did get home, things were a bit chaotic at first, we had a nurse here every other day and doctors appointments, not to mention we had not really had a chance to buy anything before she was born because we thought we had more time (My husband tried lol but we returned many things and got things that we actually needed).  Our first week home, she turned over, and shes been doing pretty well ever since.|`|9gv1B73kaa	I was 37 weeks pregnant. Me and my husband were up all night watching movies. he was about to go to sleep around 7am, and I had already been asleep for about an hour when i was awakened by a hard kick toward my Cervix. When I awoke i felt slightly damp, this is semi normal forme because i always am a bit wet, but it felt.. more so than usual, so  I got up and wet to the bathroom. as soon as I sat down the rest of my water gush-popped and my mucus plug came out (mostly, part of it was still attached) Well, I don't have a mom or any female figure I could ask about giving birth because my mom left when I was 2. so I read up online during my pregnancy. SO i had read somewhere about sometimes if a water breaks from a baby kicking downward that sometimes there leg would come out! So at this point I dont know that its my mucus plug because I am to terrified to look! So I barely manage my voice and Yell "Dominic! Dominic!" and he comes, He asks whats wrong. Im trying to stay calmandfailing horribly. I say "Dominic, My water just broke, PLEASE tell me that isnt a leg"  Well, he looks and it isn't but I am still too scared to pull the rest of the mucus plug out because i thought it might pull the baby out or something! ANYWAY so we don't have a car, so Dominic calls my dad who lives around 20 minutes away and we wait for him to get here, then drive to the hospital, which is about a half hour from here. Once I got to the Hospital I was already 4cm Dilated and my contractions were 2 min apart. Anyway, we sat there for hours as Labor Progressed until I couldn't handle it anymore, and I asked for an epideral, well they didnt want to give it just yet so they asked if just a pain med was ok. I said anything is fine. Big mistake! not only did it NOT take the pain away AT ALL, but it made the room start spinning and gave me THE WORST nausea I ever had in my life. The thing is, Dominic cant take throwing up, and I love him more than anything so I'm not going to throw him out or throw up in front of him because I'd feel horribly bad, so I kept having to unhook all these wires, wrap and IV around me, and manage to get into a bathroom with a heavy door to throw up, about every 5 minutes, AND IT DIDNT EVEN HELP THE PAIN AT ALL!, So after awhile they gave me a shot of Reglan (Nausea meds) which got rid of it, and gave me the epideral. at this point i fell asleep for awhile until the labor got so bad the epideral wasnt stopping the pain. at this point they checked me and estimated around 6 more hours labor and 2 hours pushing. Well at this point, Dominic Hadn't slept or eaten, and is both epileptic and hypoglocemic. Exhasted as he was he went to sit and caught sight of the blinking monitor,which normally wouldnt have bothered him except the low blood sugar. And he passed out and went into seizures and had to be taken away. I got so stressed out over this that the nurse checked me 5 minutes later and yelled "Get the doctor in here! She's practically crowning!" SO I had to give birth alone. 15 minutes of pushing later and Hollie Flora was born! It Doesn't end there though... Dominic came back an hour or so later, crying because he missed it, I felt so bad. well anyway, after birth the nausea came back just as hard, and they couldnt give me reglan again, so they gave me another nausea shot. it felt like tetnus and I couldn't lift my arm, plus i was TOTALLY out of it. the world was spinning and i could barely lift myself! well in this hospital there is NO nursery so the babies sleep in with the parents. Well when i was a baby they told my mom to tummy sleep me because of colic (before sids was known about) anyway Needless to say,never having been around a baby, I thought they ONLY spit up right after they ate and they told me to make her sleep on her back, back not side. well sometime in the night the baby spitup and started choking and suffocating on her own spittup, and needless to say I was so drugged up that it didnt wake me! Luckily Dominic had stayed the night with me and got her. I rolled her on her side and told the nurse and she got mad and said "On her back!" I Explained the situation and she said "WELL you just HAVE TO hear it and wake up then!" Of course WITH AS MANY MEDS AS I WAS ON, I COULDNT CONTROL IT! Needless to say I rolled Hollie back on her side, and she sleeps that way to this day. Still isnt over. After a few feedings I realized I had no milk (no collustrum either, i mean NOTHING AT ALL) and I told them,  and they said "You CANNOT formula feed! if there is nothing just make her keep sucking until your milk comes in!" well just so you know, jump into the feature, i NEVER Produced milk in the 3  days I was there, and Hollie not only had high levels of merconium in her, but also lost 3 lbs while we were there AND THEY ACCUSED ME OF BEING NEGLECTFUL AND STARVING HER!!!!!!!!!! FYI, she is formula fed now. Anyway back to the story.<br>  Next night, Dominic could only stay part of the night and he started getting sick again|`|hbLz0oVNaa	My labor story is kinda crazy!<br>  <br>  My son was born at 36 weeks. I had been in and out of the hospitol for preterm labor, so when the contractions started I called the Doctor, it was after 5pm so I got the exchange and they had me talk to the nurse on call. She told me to take a tylonal and put my feet up and that it would be ok for me to continue with labor. So I took a tylonal stayed up late cause I new I would be going that nightI ate some crackers because I was told you should eat before labor... and the labor pains didn't get much worse or closer together... I went to bed and they let up alot and I slept... so I wake up the next morning kinda bummed because even though it was early I was ready! so I got outta bed and went to get breakfast and they started up again... crackers again! So as the day went on I went shopping at every store in town trying to get as much walking done as possible, and once the mall closed me and my cousin circled her block for HOURS! at this point the pain was much worse but the timeing was eratic, they say that means false labor if your contractions are not the same distance or closer apart... well who ever said that wasn't there with me because eventually they got almost unbearable, but still eratic and my mom, hubby,  and cousin said I should go to the hospitol, I said no way! I did not want to get sent home again (for seriously the 10th trip to the hospitol) I was worried these people were begaining to just think I was nuts. So eventually I went and I got all hooked up the monitors, and lay there in bed, the pain getting worse and worse and worse. and the nurse comes in and says I haven't had a single contraction! Are you kidding me?!?!?!? I was in so much pain at this point that I had to pee soooo bad but there was no way I would have made it to the bathroom. I could barely talk to tell them how much pain I was in. So the nurse checks to see if I am dialated and she says I am at less then 1 and they were going to send me home. My mom is mad! she was nice to the nurse, but you could tell she was ready to loose it, she was asking how could they send me home if I am in this much pain, there must be something wrong if I'm not in labor. (note at this point I am holding on to the bed rails for dear life and I can't even let someone know I have to pee) So imagin now the rest of this in slow motion, because that is how it happened to me lol, atleast how it felt anyways. I heard the baby kick on the heart monitor, it sounded like a pop kind of like he directly kicked the moniter (after talking to my mom and cousin they never heard it... but i know I did) and all of a sudden my bed is wet, I have a horrified look on my face because I knew the baby kicked me in the bladder and I peed my self! So horrified! So my mom and cousin look at me and my cousin (who at that time was in school to be a CMA and who had job shadowed for a midwife for along while) looks at me and is like OMG let me see it! duh Brandi you didn't pee yourself it's your water it broke! lol so my cousin wants to checking my aminiotic fluid to see what color it is I am laying there thinmking holy s**t I am having a baby, I can't have a baby, can we just do this another day, crazy people thinking I am going to push a watermellon out of a straw, crazy people, I don't have to have a baby I should just go home and stay prego forever! so the nurse is checking to se eif Im dialating and I all of a sudden went from almost nothing to 8! and the nurse is like hmm I'm not sure if that's a head, then she has her studant nurse check, and she isn't sure, and then another nurse, and then a doc, and no body knows what it is! finnally they get a midwife in there with an U/S machine, she checks and can't tell so she does an ultra sound, sure enough he is but first! so everything starts happening so fast all I remember is a doc comiing in saying they are doing an emergency c-section, like it's no big deal, (it is a big deal to me that was seriously my worst fear come true, I had nightmres about it!) and they have me sign all this stuff and I'm freezing and paniced! finally they take me away to the OR and give me DRUGS! yes drugs finally, at this point I would have been pushing had I not had a c-section so I'm dying here, and my nurse was cool after that she was hugging me while they were giving me drugs and she was like it's ok you can do this, totally pepping me up. <br>  <br>  So finally me hubby comes in, he is a big guy he wears a size 16 shoe so they had to find shoe covers for his feet, they ended up using hair nets lol. and they are getting me ready to go, I'm freezing so they keep giving me blankets to cover my arms and chest. <br>  <br>  they finally cut me open and pull out me baby boy! they showed him to me over the curtin:<br>  <br>  That is a moment I will truely never forget! he was a little premie so he had almost no body fat, he was all wrenkly like and old man,he didn't cryhe just had his eyebrows raised and his forehead must have had 20 little 
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	How much milk/formula is he getting?  You're right that if he's getting too much of those, he isn't going to be hungry enough to eat anything.  Since he's just throwing his food on the floor, it definitely sounds like he's not hungry.<br>  <br>  Honestly, toddlers won't starve themselves.  It's your job to provide him with a healthy variety of foods and his job to eat.  You can't *make* him eat.  Also, some toddlers seem to eat very little, but their tummies are small, and some kids just need less food than others.  A serving size is only about a tablespoon at this age, if I remember correctly.  <br>  <br>  So just keep offering what you're eating at meals and don't let him fill up on liquids.  My son (who I'll admit is a big eater) is 18 months old, and he eats 3 meals and 2 snacks a day along with breastfeeding 5-10 times a day.<br>  <br>  Here's a typical day for him just to give you an idea...  (Keep in mind that your little guy may not need this much food even if you reduce his milk intake.)<br>  <br>  Breakfast:<br>  1/2 to 1 package of Quaker Instant Oatmeal (the fruit-flavored kind) or a small bowl of Cheerios or Rice Krispies and milk.  Sometimes he'll eat half or all of a waffle instead.  I offer him a small cup of juice with breakfast, but he only drinks 1-2oz. most days, if that.  He also may eat a bit of fruit -- berries, banana, pear, etc.<br>  <br>  Morning snack -- usually a banana, another kind of fruit, or some dry cereal<br>  <br>  Lunch -- often a Gerber toddler ravioli or similar meal, sometimes a small bowl/plate of leftovers from the previous night's dinner, sometimes 1-4 chicken nuggets or a hot dog, sometimes a bit of peanut butter & jelly sandwich.  He may also eat a few bites of yogurt (shared with me or a big sister), some raw carrots/celery/cucumber sometimes dipped in Ranch dressing, and/or some more fruit.  Oh, and I offer a cup of milk with lunch, but he rarely drinks more than 1-2oz.<br>  <br>  Afternoon snack -- usually some kind of fresh fruit again, dry cereal, crackers, and/or a piece of cheese<br>  <br>  Dinner -- whatever we're having -- pasta, chicken, fish, pot roast, eggs, ham, pizza, quesadillas, veggies, bread, rice, etc.  After dinner, he may get some fruit or a small treat for dessert.<br>  <br>  Definitely try cutting back on the fluids and just keep offering what you're eating, and I bet your son will start eating more soon enough.  Let him have his own utensils if he wants them, or he can eat with his fingers, or you can give him bites off of your plate.  Try several things and see what he prefers for now.<br>  <br>  Hope that gives you a few more ideas!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	just keep at it...hey your dongthe best you can. all keids have this phase where they just dont want food and ould prefer to decorate the kitchen with it. make it up, put it in front of him no attention to it and just leave him be. if he doesnt eat it its ok he will eventually come round he wont starve himself, as long as you keep offering it.|`|bHCssC0zaa	My son is 19 months,he does the same.<br>  Sometimes he eat and sometimes does not want to eat anything at all,<br>  but he would never eat unless I play his favourtie Cartoons dvd or advertisements that he likes.<br>  I do that so that he eats atleast,but someday that does not work even.<br>  I am doing same,giving him formula once at 2 times one morning time and one before go to bed,so that he stays healthy.<br>  Numbers of mothers say donot give formula at this age,but I am not giving 3-4 bottles,just two.<br>  I am fine with that as long as he should be getting nutrition he needs.<br>  It’s a stage,I think,as my son sometimes eat and sometimes not.<br>  He will not sit to eat,if I play cartoons then would eat quietly,so its not he is not hungry,just don’t wanna sit.|`|7KkTel7Oaa	as long as you're offering him food, it sounds like you're doing fine. babies love to fling stuff, if just to see the reaction it makes. Try some finger foods that he likes (cheerios, grapes, carrot sticks) and when he's hungry, he'll eat. Babies are like that (well, toddlers are)
CBgDc1Auaa	if you're having lower back pains... a great releiver of that is an inversion table... <br>  <br>  it is great for releasing pressure on the disks of your back...

I wouldn't be getting all annoyed over this, I mean it's your baby's way of preparing for her big debut, when she'll have to breathe on her own. The more she practices, the better developed her lungs will be for when she arrives. You don't have that much longer left. Try to massage your belly when she starts hiccupping, changing positions, sleeping on an incline, and talk to her...
FplTPoAyaa	I give my daughter a teething ring to bite on when she starts biting people (me).  She is biting because she is teething and her gums hurt.  So, I give her an alternative to biting me.  They are really too young at this age to fully understand "no", and they can't truly be "disciplined".  Good luck !|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Put your finger against his lips and firmly (Do not Yell) say No Biting! When he does this. Say it so he knows it is a bad thing.|`|CBJge2kxaa	In my early childhood development class we were taught that some children tend to bite when they have a communication barrier, for example he maybe trying to tell you something but doesn't have the vocabulary skills for it yet therefore frustrating him and in turn may bite.  He is old enough for time out and knows the diff between yes and no then i would go that route or even like a previous post mentioned about pushing on his lips but maybe try putting gentle pressure on his bottom lip with it on his teeth and tell him, "see teeth hurt"  "don't bite please"|`|m6GSXW40aa	Well he is only 9 months. That is kind of hard but i do know that when he gets a little bit older hot sauce or vinegar work great! Maybe just verbally correcting tell him no that is not nice etc...

mc6YtaRbaa	Once you are finished having sex, you can put a pillow under your hips, your leg position doesn't really effect anything, it's all in the hips! All that does is let gravity help the sperm get to where they should be going, you really don't "have" to do it. Just laying there for a 10 minutes can help so they are not fighting gravity.|`|AFxOZ0Hxaa	I've tried both with pillow under hips & legs against wall. I try to move very little after BD, although in reality I am sure any sperm that might slip out didn't really have a chance of getting up there to the egg to begin with!|`|vigFmfLmaa	No position is going to guarantee conception.  You just need sperm to reach egg, that's all.  Some women practically stand on their head and don't realize that in doing so they may actually be decreasing the number of sperm going where they need to go.  If you tip your pelvis back too far, the semen can collect behind your cervix lip.  My RE suggests lying in bed 5 minutes after sex with your knees bent so your feet on flat on the mattress, at a maximum.  Even this is not necessary.  Healthy sperm go where they are supposed to.  And if they aren't healthy doing yoga-sex isn't going to make them. ;-)|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Its not a guarantee to get pregnant,with my son i didnt do any of that,i just had sex,wasnt trying to conceive,we did it doggy,me on top,sideways,missionary everyday for a whole month,but it does help if u lay down and not let it come out good luck|`|MAh2yKFnaa	none of that really matters or guarantees a pregnancy.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	do whatever works best for you just make sure hips are up. Good Luck :)|`|ZvqP3a6Qaa	you dont have to have your legs raised... after you have sex just slide a pillow under your bum for about 20minutes so the semen has time to find the egg. you dont want to get up right after or a lot will spill out and you dont just want to lay flat because it will flow out as well.. but a pillow is all you need.

I had it after my son was born. I had no complications from it. We had it taken out after three years because we wanted to have another baby and got pregnant right away. (Two months later and first try)<br>  <br>  So I would strongly suggest it. And f.y.i if you are still spotting when you go get it no biggie. I was worried about it but my doctor was glad I was because that eliminated the possibility of me being pregnant and an unnecessary pregnancy test. <br>  <br>  I took the no hormone pill after my first born and had some pretty funky side effects that I wont go into but were not great. So I wouldn't suggest that one at all.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I used the mini-pill (progesterin only pill) while nursing my son, it did not affect my breast milk supply at all. I bought a sports watch and set the alarm to remind me to take it at the same time everyday. When we decided to start ttc our next child I stopped using it and conceived the next month :). <br>  <br>  I looked into the IUC and chose not to go that route due to it preventing fertilized eggs from implanting (one of the three ways it is believed to work according to the manufacturers website). That is a personal decision though, many people use the IUC and have no problems with it.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Personally the idea of an IUD freaks me out LOL so that is not an option I would choose. Some birth control pills are okay to use while nursing, but others (depending on the hormone in them) can decrease milk production, so you don't want that. <br>  <br>  We actually use a spermicidal jelly that inserts like a tampon applicator. Kind of messy, (but then so is sex! LOL) but used only when necessary and non-hormonal, non-prescription, which is why I like it. I've never had any problems with it and it's been 100% successful when used. $10 a box at Walmart! <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shopinprivate.com/concongelpac.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopinprivate.com/concongelpa...</a> for a picture|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	I have had the  Mirena IUD now for 4 yrs and it is great. <br>   No weight gain, no problems and very light periods, and nothing to remember to take.<br>    I highly recommend it.  and when the time comes that you want another child, just remove it !|`|9eno55hCaa	Im getting an IUD put in.  I can get it removed whenever i want.  Not sure id want to go back on pills...since i was on those when i got oregnant to begin with|`|9SdQkauuaa	I have the mirena iud and I love it. I got it at my 6 week checkup. The thought of ever goin back to a pill is out the door now I love not having to worry about anything. I'm gonna be honest with you, I bled and spotted off and on the first 3 or 4 months and now I'm entering my 5th month and the bleeding has regulated. I hear after a year or so periods are supposed to go away-cant wait! But I would def recommend it.|`|S7XTl9NCaa	I did the nursing-safe birth control pill (I forget the name, your doc will know). That way we could stop right away when we wanted another. <br>  <br>  I'm not very knowledgable about other forms of BC as I've used the pill for over 8 years on and off and it has worked great. But a quick call to your docs and a talk with the nurse will give you a great idea of what to ask for at your visit.|`|XJGPDzLvaa	depends on what you're comfortable with and what your religious beliefs are.  One of the mechanisms of IUD's work is prevention of implantation of a fertilized egg. Some may have a problem with that. I didn't want to take anything, so my husband and I just use condoms. With a little baby, we didn't have time for regular intimacy, so condoms worked well for us for the few occasions that we needed them.|`|35BVWK37aa	I have the Paragard IUD, it has no hormones, and won't give barely any side effects.  SOme women have a bit heavier periods, but I haven't really.  This is my second one and I was able to get preggers 4 days after having it removed so no lingering issues.|`|fdWIP0Yiaa	I love the IUD. I used progesterone only pills for a while, but if you are even an hour late taking the pill you start spotting, they were hard for me to take, but the IUD has been great. |`|isokr9cfaa	The only think I can do is tell you what not to take.

You definitely need to do more research of the schools you are of interested, and compare with the local public schools.  Some districts has very good public schools too, so i think it really depends on your area.|`|d7kGopYxaa	I personally like public schools better. I hate public schools but i hate the chater school i went to more.|`|AA10309492	its honestly a matter of opinion.  i wasnt comfortable going to a big school.  so i went to a charter school where they focused on the main subjects and not  classes such as "einstein evolution" or some crap like that.  it was a lot smaller than a public school which made it easier to get the help you needed from the teachers.
LbkLg4RFaa	Sounds just like my little one.  From the moment he was about 2 months old he has averaged about an hour sleep total during the day.  I wouldn't worry too much about what articles say, babies are different and if she's content and not getting overtired then she's getting enough sleep.  As she grows and starts moving more her day-time sleeps may increase.|`|JQZDCcyQaa	My DD who is 6 months has two sleeps during the day about 3 hrs each, and sleeps 12 hrs at night but wakes once during the night so she usually sleeps 7-8hrs then wakes has a feed then back to sleep for another 4-5 hrs, I think if thats how your daughter wants to sleep and shes not cranky or tired and it works for everyone then its fine, plus if it means she sleeps longer at night then I am all for it!!|`|XPnCeJ29aa	My son is 7 months now, and it just depends on the day.<br>  SOmetimes he will take two naps lasting about 1 1/2 hour each, sometimes one nap...and a couple days he hasnt even taken a nap.<br>  He is the type that if there is something going on...he has to be in the middle of it.<br>  But he has started going to sleep earlier now...so I guess he goes all day, and then knocks out at night.<br>  |`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter is 12 weeks old (7 weeks premie) and she sleeps about 2 hours during the day and roughly wakes every 2 hours at night....We are still working on this sleeping problem...lol|`|gJAcoZQzaa	At that age my baby was taking 3, half hour naps a day, sleeping 11 hours and waking once or twice a night. Nothing can be really done to change it, your baby is their own person. Now at 10 months he's sleeping about 3 1/2 hours in the day and 11 hours strait in the night. According to the 'experts' he should be sleeping less now- Oh, I guess they can be wrong sometimes..heh.|`|dJI38ZC5aa	i think it depends on baby. mine takes 3 quick naps, 1 long nap and sleeps about 8 hours a night. but my friends baby sleeps 10 hours a night and takes 2 short naps and one long one.<br>  <br>  basically, your baby will let you know if she needs more sleep.|`|KICQQxLxaa	My DD is 20 months old and she takes a 1.5-3 hour nap, and sleeps 11-12 hours at night.<br>  <br>  That seems like a small amount of sleep for a 4.5 month old.

deIzFnV8aa	CIO is never the _only_ choice - you should see if your library has the No Cry Sleep Solution by Elizabeth Pantley.  THere might be some ideas that could help you in there.<br>  <br>  Less naps will probably make the problem worse; overtired babies don't sleep as well. However, limiting the length of each individual nap to no more than 2 hours might, if she is taking long naps.<br>  <br>  Also, if you haven't introduced a pacifier, it will at least help with getting her back to sleep more quickly (though our DD still wakes up wanting it after it has fallen out :(  )<br>  <br>  Something that has actually been working for us a bit is white noise - I know put on a nature CD of wave noise and leave it on pretty much all night! So much for dear daughter learning to self soothe, but dear parents want more sleep!|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	If you haven't started her on solid foods yet, she may be ready for them.  my little one did the same thing.  only at close to four months.  as soon as i started giving him rice cereal before bed with a spoon, he started sleeping normal again.  but then again i could be wrong.  but if you decide to try that, rice cereal is normally the first food.  you should talk to your pediatrician first though, just to make sure.  hope this helps and good luck.|`|9818b912e2bdbaad67833b0695ca3196aa	im actually having the same problem with my 5 mo old son..he was doing great and was only getting up like 1 maybe  2 times a night but this past month has been getting up like every 45 min-2 hrs. he was just wanting rocked back to sleep..at first i thought it might have been his teeth but he wasnt aggravated, he just wanted me(he is also breastfed). i finally got to the point i just started letting him cry it out..this will be my 4th night doing that and within 3 nights of already doing it he only got up 1 time last night. so it does definetly work! it is very hard to lay there and hear them cry but it teaches them to soothe themselves and sleep better for us. i would give it a try for a week you would be amazed how your baby may do with it. good luck ;-)|`|XvePaWWXaa	My son is the exact same age and doing the exact same thing. He slept awesome, 6-8 hours a night, from Thanksgiving to Christmas, then it all went bad for some reason. He's getting oatmeal for lunch and dinner which he LOVES.  I don't think he is teething either, he drooled for a while but not any more. <br>  <br>  If you don't have a night time routine, start one. My guy goes to bed around 8:30, 9:00. We have a bath every few days, go in his room and get jammies on, play in the crib for a while (he won't sleep there, long story), read some books, nurse, then it's night night time. I just started this a few days ago and it seems to be going well. He still wakes up 3 or so times during the night but that is down from 5. <br>  <br>  Is she getting enough sleep during the day? Babies that age should be taking 2-3 naps and getting 3-4 hours of sleep total. She could be over tired and not able to sleep. I wish I had some answers for you, I'm struggling with the whole night time thing too, these are just suggestions based on some books I'm reading. Crying it out is NOT your only solution. I tried that a few weeks ago and it sucked. He was awake for TEN hours straight, he refused to sleep, it was awful.|`|k6HkVB5Yaa	Hey I have a 5 month old son, and I'm having the same problems. He was sleeping through the night at 2 months up until about 3.5 months of age. But ever since then has not. He is also breastfed. I introduced him to cereals a few weeks ago, and that does not seem to help him sleep through the night either. I guess it will just take time. He is still co-sleeping as well, as his brother and him have to share a room, and his brother is only 2, so I'd rather not have the two of them up at night, so until I get this whole sleeping thing sorted out then he will remain in the bed with us. I didn't have this problem with my other son, but I just think all babies are different and they will eventually figure it all out.

kv8ZFPP1aa	if you're planning on having sex then you should use some kind of protection. but what you're friend probably didn't tell you is that you need a prescription for BC and that means your parents taking you to the dr. so they would know about your plans. but it is better to be safe than sorry. but remember if you don't want to go on BC then you can always use the male and female condoms which you don't need a prescription and you can get them at any age.<br>  <br>  i just read some of your other questions...have you guys had sex before and just now deciding that you need to get on birth control?? you're already pregnant and thinking about giving them up for adoption so why are you still thinking about having sex?|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	You cant have safe sex without birth control of some description.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Umm, if you're planning on having sex, but don't want kids yet, then yes, you *both* need to be on birth control (condoms for him).

qImMwhUHaa	My children were eating 4 to 5 times daily at that age and breastfeeding on demand. I suggest feeding him more frequently and instead of just cereal for breakfast, give him fruit and cereal, then a snack, then a good lunch with everything that you would eat, snack and then a supper of whatever you would eat.  Continue to breastfeed too.|`|GU3RauKOaa	He's 11 months old now and almost ready to switch from getting most of his nutrients from his milk to getting most of his nutrients from his food. So he could be eating 4-5 times a day. Three normal sizes meals and a few snacks here and there. 3rd percentile doesn't mean he is underweight or not gaining well if he has been around that percentile all along. Now if he was say in the 30th percentile and dropped down to the 3rd that would be a sign that he is no longer gaining well. So basically, don't worry too much but keep snacks available to him (you can have high fat snacks like whole cheeses and yogurts which are still healthy and should put some weight on him). If you keep breastfeeding past a year, that's great, and will help him gain weight as breastmilk is high in fat. If you switch to cow's milk, of course get whole milk.|`|g7r4W2vRaa	Do not give him formula. You are doing a great job. Since he is 11 months old he can have some finger foods. Have him snack on some Cheerios, crackers, Those puffs for baby's. That will help him to get on some regular foods as well as get him to gain weight. I wouldn't be too concerned. if the doctor is not concerned then you shouldn't be either.|`|MeYILJeSaa	Just because he's in the 3rd percentile doesn't mean he's underweight. He may just naturally be a little baby. Is the doctor concerned? <br>  If your baby is happy, then chances are, he is doing fine.|`|pvH3oHRfaa	Has he always been on the 3rd percentile, or has he dipped down? If he has always been on the 3rd percentile, then I wouldn't worry too much.<br>  <br>  How often does he nurse? Does he still wake in the night? Chances are that he could want more solid food. But you can go with your instinct on that. If he seems satisfied after his solid meals, then he's probably getting enough. If he's still waking loads in the night, he might need more.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry too much about the growth charts, unless your doctor expresses any concern. Studies have actually shown the growth charts in the uk are not accurate as they do not show healthy growth for breastfed babies. Breastfed babies actually dip in growth later on in the first year, and do not put on as much weight as formula fed babies. They are actually blaming these incorrect growth charts for the rise on childhood obesity as people are panicking and overfeeding their babies.<br>  <br>  My daughter was born on the 9th percentile, and has hovered round there until last month when she dipped down to the 3rd percentile. But she's healthy, happy, thriving, and perfectly proportioned. I'm feeding her as much as *she wants* to be fed, as babies will just eat until they're satisfied. You can't really go wrong with that way of feeding!|`|9DtJeAUKaa	You could still breatfeed, but supplement w/ formula or add formula & fruit babyfood to his cereal.<br>  <br>  You could give him a few more snacks ~ fruit baby food, Zwieback toast & things. You should really ask his Pediatrician who will tell you if your baby needs to gain more weight & the best methods for him & you. :)
8Raw4M1naa	He feels left out that he couldn't go bowling with his friends. It makes him feel as though there is something wrong with him and the way he is built. If they didn't have his shoe size, he feels like his feet must be wrong, and is self-conscious about his body and self-esteem. Talk to him and let him know hes wonderful just the way he is, and take him out for a special treat, just for him.|`|Kyrtz3joaa	I think you mean bowling. And you should have asked for the next size up. If there were a lot of kids there that day they very well may have ran out of size 13's. It's not like they make the shoes there.|`|gb4VzNXQaa	What do you mean why is he so upset?  He got left out and now feels like his size has to do with it.  That is a very big deal to many kids.  Show some sympathy.|`|64OsCr8laa	children suffer with self esteem and that person totally downed him!!!<br>  i would have told her off for my sons sake she should have done what she could to give him any shoe close to fitting him|`|132a94967b26774746922b6b7c03bf49aa	Are you for real?  You don't understand why he was upset?  Nobody likes to be left out - his friends had fun bowling and he had to just sit there and do nothing.  And the reason he was excluded was because he is small.  No man (even if he's only 12) wants to be considered tiny in any way.  Double whammy.  Nobody's fault - but he had a rotten afternoon.  Not stupid at all.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	So he should have asked for a bigger size and could have went bowlling.|`|X6as2nOAaa	then they should have given him a little bit bigger size and I would complain to him about it.
dfabd64401f067cfb025eb302db5b0f7aa	I've done that.... it was the most perfect experience and we're trying for our second baby now. If successful we'll be using the same birthing methods we used the first time.<br>  <br>  Totally natural. I was up and showering myself within a half-hour of giving birth. But then, my husband was the perfect birthing partner.<br>  <br>  And neither of us are hippies - we both work full-time professional jobs.|`|ISjFdI1taa	No - I'd rather stay in a dirty hospital than risk a still birth or having a brain damaged baby at home.<br>  I would have lost my first baby if I had decided on a home birth.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	No way, it's not worth taking the risks by giving birth without medical advice.  Wish I'd turned on The Morning now, lol|`|YsnY9LqIaa	I was just going to ask the same question!  No, I wouldn't consider it.  I realise the woman on This Morning was a nurse, so perhaps she had a slight advantage but still - in birth, she could've had a completely different one to the last 2 births, been in immense pain and unable to make logical judgements putting herself and her baby in jeopardy.  I too was unhappy with the hospital birth I had with my first baby (though I didn't agree with her saying it was all over medicalised - I felt unmonitored, ignored and that it was all very impersonal!), and will have a home birth with my second baby but I would never do it with no medical help at all, I think that would be completely ignorant and irresponsible.|`|eXsR8Gx5aa	ha ha ha, just been on the phone to my other half about it! (I made a joke about a paddling pool in the front room and him playing midwife!!)<br>  <br>  Funny you should ask, my friend went through the same thing as that woman - neither the midwife nor ambulance turning up on time for her second home birth.<br>  <br>  No, I would have a homebirth with a midwife, but not for my first - I'm planning a hospital waterbirth with this one.|`|PBI3tCKaaa	No.. what if something were to go wrong?  I would rather have the baby monitored.|`|Qptt0B56aa	I think that for your first baby, probably not. Maybe if your first went fine with no complications, and you had adequate facilities at home, and your partner was fine with it too. It's a risk I would be happy to take for maybe a second or third child, but not a first.|`|9eno55hCaa	I wouldnt chance it myself personally.  But i know a few women who have given birth at home unassited.  A friend down the road from me did so 3 years ago.  And she had no assistance at all.  My husbands mother did the same with all of her children (personally I think thats a bit crazy) lol.|`|nwWBddEnaa	wish i had the chance as i hate hospitals but i have GBS and need a drip put in straight to prevent the baby been infected, i hate making a fuss and people tryin to help me the only thing i would really have to think about is pain relief. good luck x|`|APrvPTsNaa	No. Women and their babies die in childbirth. I do think that we should have more choice in the birth experience, but I know that when I had my boys, I was glad to be in a hospital. If anything had gone wrong, the experts were next door.|`|vkIqaFQ1aa	Nearly happened to me.  <br>  I was at home and the mid-wife, in the final stages found that she had come without the pain relief!!!!  Just me, her and my husband. We managed,  after all not much we could do but get on with it. lol|`|AA11587891	Not on your nelly!!!!!!<br>  <br>  The reason death in childbirth has gone down is due to medical supervision and support.  Its a risk I would not willingly take.|`|fdPs5ZTKaa	NO NO NO NO!<br>   midwives were invented for a reason!<br>  <br>  The only good bit about giving birth are the drugs :)|`|KjFiLbZ3aa	I wish I was that brave. But no, I wouldn't.|`|44zeoC9Naa	Haha u must of just watched it on This Mornin... i wouldnt do it tho no! Better to be safe than sorry really
9eno55hCaa	My daughter is just barely 3 months she rolls, does baby push-ups, uses her feet to push herself forward on the floor till her arms get stuck then she cries.  Follows toys with her eyes, grabs for small toys on her play arch.  She still tries to hold her bottle but it only lasts for a few minutes then she drops it (she started this at 2 weeks)|`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter is just barely 3 months she rolls, does baby push-ups, uses her feet to push herself forward on the floor till her arms get stuck then she cries.

She hates being on her tummy, but when we do it she is on her tummy she gets up pretty far    She is kinda-sorta acting like she's about ready to roll over which scares the pee-pants off of me lol.     She is breastfed, but tries to hold her own bottles when she gets one.     It is so amazing that my husband's nasty sperm and my little egg came together and now it's all smiling and playing!

FAv1RYe6aa	You might want to put her in a soapy bath water for a bit, then use some kind of oil (Veg. oil, Olive oil) to loosen up the glue on the tape.<br>  Poor little thing! I bet she never does that again.|`|9As5iq0gaa	OMG!! You have no-one else to ask but strangers on a computer?

Goodness me what is the world coming too? |`|geNT36PWaa	I would take her to the hospital if you rip her skin it could scar her! Olive oil or butter might help ease it off.

Also try baby oil. If all else fails you may have to go to the doctor.|`|d1KsXP4Xaa	Yeah, veggie oil might be good.  Try to find any non-harmful substance like that which will help "un-stick" the adhesive that is sticking the tape to her skin.|`|mRVB4yfNaa	Shower, shouldn't that loosen it somewhat.|`|elZvRocyaa	I say go to the ER.|`|RzYePezkaa	I say go to the dr or you can try putting her in a bath and see if the glue softens enough to take the tape off while she is soaking in tub.|`|9eno55hCaa	Try using some vegtable oil as your pulling it off, it should make it a bit looser (My brother wrapped tape around his foot for some reason when he was 8 ... kids huh?)..If this doesnt work then I would suggest going to the ER.

smsUZG4Iaa	If you smoke or use illegal drugs, it is very important to quit before trying to become pregnant. Smoking is associated with increased risks of miscarriage and bleeding and with premature birth, low birth weight, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), lower IQ, and slower physical growth. Marijuana, cocaine, and other illegal drugs can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth, birth defects, and infant drug withdrawal. If you need help finding ways to quit, you may wish to talk to your doctor.<br>  If you drink alcohol, you should limit (or avoid) drinking while trying to become pregnant. Alcohol can cause fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), which can lead to mental slowness, poor growth, and physical defects. Your partner should also limit alcohol and try to quit using illegal drugs or smoking, since this can affect his sperm.<br>  <br>   Limit your caffeine intake while trying to become pregnant, as drinking more than two cups of coffee, tea, or caffeinated soda a day may decrease your chances of getting pregnant. <br>  <br>  Additionally, make sure you are not being exposed to toxic substances, such as radiation or heavy metals. Avoid having x-rays while you are trying to get pregnant or while pregnant, since the radiation from x-rays can put your developing baby at risk. If you are concerned about anything you are being exposed to, talk to your doctor.<br>  i hope this helps you understand why you are told not to do these thing if TTC.. Best of Luck|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	I think its different if u drink and u end up drunk and getting pregnant,but if ur an alchoholic then thats a different story,if u consume alcohol everyday every hour then ur decreasing ur fertility,its like smokers,if u smoke 1 it doesnt hurt,if u smoke for years,it adds up,i conceived my son while i was high on weed,i was 19 and stupid please dont judge me,so i dont believe in that stuff,like if ur overweight it will be hard to conceive,my cousin is 4'11 and 300lbs,she had a healthy 9lb baby,its not always about that stuff....good luck|`|4UotaSeiaa	alcohol and caffeine are only bad when you get pregnant <br>  alcohol can cause babies to be born with facial and brain abnormalities<br>  and caffeine can produce underweight babies<br>  and both can increase the chance of miscarriages.|`|EK3nwsAcaa	i think if you dont think about it then that will be your month|`|vigFmfLmaa	Because alcohol, caffeine and saliva don't prevent pregnancy!  If so we'd use those for birth control rather than pills and condoms!  Caffeine and alcohol should be kept under moderation by all people, TTC or not, because it's not healthy in excess.  Saliva doesn't kill off all sperm in an ejaculate either, it's just not recommended for men who already have a low sperm count.  Most of these extreme things you hear may help couples with fertility problems, like the saliva thing, but they are of no use to normal, healthy fertile couples.  Those couples can take up to a year to conceive and that's perfectly normal.

According to these various definitions I found on google: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&pwst=1&defl=en&q=define:toddler&ei=gPWmSbmPJZCNngff2fT0Dw&sa=X&oi=glossary_definition&ct=title" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&pwst=...</a><br>  <br>  It is either 12-36 months, 12-24 months or 15-24 months.<br>  <br>  But its generally the phase between infancy and preschool where a little one learns to walk and "toddles" around.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	:O( I guess from reading these q's my daughter is no longer a 'baby' she's 14months, she can walk.. <br>  She's still my baby though!! lol|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	mine never toddled but started walking at 9 months.  she finally started crawling at 18 months when i got a dog.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	You can tell when they turn into a toddler. They are miniature people who discover, learn, and are either happy or mad. lol  When they start walking usually is when people refer to them as toddlers because as one person said, they toddle. ;)|`|4YIUxSlYaa	When they walk or 12 months.  Which ever comes first.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	When they can walk without a lot of close watching.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	I would say after 12 months, but that's just my opinion.|`|1Hq4vC8Jaa	Some people say when they start walking but some baby's have been known to walk as early as 7-8 months and as late as 18 months.  At 7-8 months they are still considered infants weather they are walking or not. So as far as I know once they hit a year old, they are considered toddlers. Hope this helped.|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	Good question!  I was pondering this to myself a few days ago.  I think it's when they start walking good.  I got an e-mail the other day from a sight that was updating me about the stages my "toddler" would be in and I was like "WHAT!  She's only 8 1/2 months old!"  It made me want to cry, she is growing up sooo fast.|`|Xc02z608aa	I think a baby becomes a toddler when they can walk and are bottle broke.|`|Ot8lxaMEaa	I always thought that they became a toddler at 12 months but I could be wrong|`|QDp6LwFFaa	2 or 3|`|AA10888290	I think officially at 12 months|`|IBU7tf4saa	when they start to toddle
8EeVtXv9aa	Ohh sorry about that hunny, my period is also due on the 28th ... fingers crossed for both of us ayy! <br>  my period symptoms are low back ache, i feel bubbly in my stomach and gassy, frequent urination, crampy belly and cramps in my left leg dont know if that could be but my anti had these syptoms and she was pregnant were ll differnt. i wish you all the best :) xxxoh and my gradnmother had a cyst on her ovary and she had 4children :)|`|OhSu11W6aa	i took a test 7 days before i was suposte to start i had all the early symptoms and knew i was... and i got light +, took another one the next day a little bit darker took 2 more and each one was darker than the one before. I am 6 weeks and just took a digital test and says preg!!! test in the AM.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	with my second i tested every day for a week before i was supposed to get my . with those "5 days early" tests and got all negatives BUT on the day it was supposed to start i got a positive...|`|SLSvynetaa	Thoose are all the symptoms of pregnancy.... Um test again in 5 days if nothing changed again in 7 days if still nothings changed... 10 days... if still nothings changed then ur not pregnant. OO nd try to use a different testing divice like the clear blue... or something like that... <br>   :-)  8-)|`|5RvTXdmUaa	pregnancy symptoms dont start that early, usually they only start when you're at least a week late. Wait until your period is actually late to test.
cFjz2GUxaa	1) Breast Growth(2 weeks pregnant, but I believe that this is early)<br>  2) Frequent unrination(4 weeks pregnant)<br>  3) Tender Breasts (3-4 weeks pregnant)<br>  4) Hunger(5-6 weeks pregnant)<br>  <br>  These were my symptoms of pregnancy with my son. I never got sick, but I heard that if you don't get sick by the 6th week you most likely aren't going to.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|wqZbkYpMaa	see a doctor, you could be in the family way or you could have other mysterious problems.|`|CFFuFof1aa	I got mine at five weeks on the dot. Sounds like if you are 8 days late then you would be 5 weeks. I wouldn't wait. Go get a First Response test. It will tell you. And those are pregnancy symptoms.|`|YIb23obFaa	i started getting symptons right after i got pregnant, i took a test a couple weeks later and i was three weeks! that soon. nausea always tired sense of smell thingand breasts start hurting right away
yFG0NhD4aa	  Even though my son is 11, I always dressed any way that made me feel good.  I think being called a milf is great for you...some people feel like they are out of it because they are a mom, NO WAY!  You still got it, and you have another little someone to think you are the most beautiful person in the world, too!<br>    I dress according to occasion.  Work, conservative, out with friends (whenever that happens these days) I dress more fun in a semi-conservative way! ha<br>    I don't dress as "bad" as I did before my baby, but I think that also comes with growing up, I was 21 before baby.<br>    Mom jeans, you should see if you can find the saturday night live skit of the mom jeans.  I believe they are jeans w/ the waste line closer to your boobs than your bellybutton! hahahaha<br>  |`|0poGXRqTaa	First of all, all of the "lols" that you type with are distracting and a little annoying.  Were you really laughing that much and that hard as you were typing the question?<br>  To answer your question, I don't dress different now that i'm a mom, I dress different now that i'm older and have a professional job.  I go for more of a classic style vs. Forever XXI style.|`|F0rbWQL8aa	I have never done my make-up just to hang out around the house.  I always used to wear make-up to Wal-Mart, but since getting married I only do this if I had a break out lol.  I think I dress a little bit more maturely now that I am a mom.  I used to wear some t-shirts that had sayings that could be interpretted as sexual...I don't wear those anymore.  I think I worry about what I wear more now because I don't want it to appear that I have "let myself go".|`|xlcKBMw7aa	You're lucky, I dress in oversize t-shirts and jeans, hardly ever do my makes up and my hair is always in either a poney tail or just left hanging...i feel so unattractive, but oh'well i'd rather be having fun with my daughter than trying to look good for my fiance.|`|T4Zhixx0aa	"my boyfriends friends always call me a milf i think its so funny!"<br>  <br>  Wow, it's good to see being a mom has caused you to mature so much!! Don't burn out that one brain cell you have coming up with such intelligent questions..you come across like a COMPLETE BIMBO. <br>  Your poor baby....|`|Fdh7j4uraa	I still dress the same, put my make up on and do my hair. Why does being a mom mean that I have to let myself go? I don't neglect my child. I get up before she does and get myself ready for the day and then I get her up. |`|S7XTl9NCaa	I dress about the same, except some of my clothes aren't small and cute anymore. My boobies never shrunk back down after weaning, so i can't wear my tank tops or button ups anymore, as they don't fit.<br>  <br>  I never left the house without makeup before I had children! OMG wouldn't think of it!  <br>  <br>  I do tend to wear my hair pulled back waaay more than i did before though, cause little hands love to pull your hair. Same thing with extra jewelry.|`|yewpjlDqaa	Well, I don't work anymore so now I just wear my weekend gear 7 days/week. Jeans, shirt, flip flops, oversized handbag. I wear less makeup since I don't go to work, but I've never worn a lot of makeup anyway. I shower every morning after the gym, wash my face, moisturize, dress. I never wear sweats all day, although the first several weeks that's all I wore. I barely left the house for the first few weeks. You'll see. The first couple months you'll be far more concerned with caring for your baby and trying to keep things together than what you're wearing. There will be days you can't shower. That's just how things go. My baby is 9 months and life is more normal now. |`|UWmaPkJRaa	my style is still the same <br>  <br>  and mom jeans are pants that come all the way up past your bellybutton and make a pouch under the pants lol they are ugly!!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	It has unfortunately but only because I dont fit into all the same tight stuff anymore! But i do have to have makeup on when i go out, even to the market. Cant be out in public without eyebrows drawn in can I? |`|pXSKSS3daa	I don't bother with make up unless we go out, and even then it would have to be out to eat and not just running to the grocery store. Most days I'm in shorts or sweats and a tshirt with my hair up in a pony tail or bun. It's not that I don't have the time to do any of that stuff, I would just rather spend that time with my son.|`|WirFwirLaa	I pretty much dress the same, but i'm just like you, dress the same just now in a bigger size :(<br>  <br>  I still do my hair and makeup and get my nails done. I don't want to look or feel any differently now than I did before I had a child. I still want ppl to think i'm a pretty girl and I still want to occasionally get 'checked out'! I don't think there's anything wrong with that!|`|q3i4oUhraa	I would say I have "let myself go" I barely wear make up anymore (I am a SAHM) I live in jeans, and stretch, yoga style pants. I start to stress if I can't find my hair elastic!!<br>  <br>    THe other night I went out, and dressed up, wore make up, the whole nine yards. My nine mos. old was looking at me funny. I joked to my husband that she doesn't recognize me!lol I keep telling myself I should try more, but oh well. Who the hell am I trying to impress?|`|19ffba4361dcf9c1511f4e3daa996315aa	before i was a mom i dressed extremely hoochie.. Now I only dress revealing when I go to a club.  But even then I tend to show off my legs and shoulders and back and still cover up everything else,  where was before I only covered what would be covered by a bikini. i wore mini skirts with halter tops, booty shorts with tube tops. I wear  a lot of hiplength clingy t-shirts. I've never been comfortable with a lot of make-up, just gloss and eyeliner for the most part. I have chopped off all my hair, but that wasnt until after i had my 3rd child|`|TAGsuqu2aa	My style is the same as I am able to fit into my pre-pregnancy clothes. I dress what I feel is appropriate whether it be for work or going to the store, etc. I don't do much to my hair besides putting gel on and keeping my bangs away from my face, lol  I'm not much of a makeup person but I do apply some I just do it lightly and enough to enhance my features. I feel I don't need to use much efforts into worrying about my looks as I feel I look great for being a mother of 2 children. Most people assume I am in my late teens to early 20's when in actuality I am close to hitting the big 3-0! I love to be complimented that way because who doesn't want to have a youthful look? It's better then being called a MILF, if anyone of my Husband's friends were to say that to me I wouldn't be so offended and take it in the ***, but I would think it is inappropriate to say and disrespectful as well. If you want to call me hot, sexy, good looking, just say it, just don't call me a MILF, because the only person that gets it is my Husband. :D

eytlIKITaa	Why not just take the colors from the illustrations and paint the walls one color, bedding in a complimenting color and then accent the room with wall decor of actual Beatrix Potter things.  You could get pictures blown up and framed, same thing with some stories.  Try and create the same feeling in that room that you feel reading and looking at her books!  Hope I helped!  Good luck!!!|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Well may I suggest that you firstly, choose the right colours to get the fee you want and paint the walls like that...then get bedding in the same range...then buy china Beatrix Potter figurines and have them all on a cream painted shelf...you can find those easily...big department shops have them and they are on Ebay too ...put in "China Beatrix Potter" Then you could perhaps pay a local artist to paint some of the characters on the walls in a mural and buy extra soft toys...put in "Peter Rabbit soft toy" or "Peter Rabbit Plush" and they will come up. I think that would all look even better than all matchy matchy bedding etc.|`|pXSKSS3daa	<a href="http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/beatrix-potter-nursery-theme.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unique-baby-gear-ideas.com/be...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.janechurchill.com/nursery_beatrix.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.janechurchill.com/nursery_bea...</a><br>  <br>  Here are some ideas as well:<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Decorating-a-Babys-Nursery-with-a-Beatrix-Potter-Theme&id=205213" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Decorating-a-B...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.beatrixpotteremporium.com/trolleyed/5/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.beatrixpotteremporium.com/tro...</a><br>  <br>  Or, if you or someone you know is good at sewing have you thought about trying to find fabric and making everything?

sK8rxstvaa	He probably is nervous to be all alone with him! But that's no excuse to always pass the baby off - he should really start to try to cope alone. I can understand his nervousness of course, who isn't a bit nervous with a little baby at some point? <br>  <br>  My husband doesn't avoid any duty - we play russian roulette so to speak with the poopy diapers - whomever gets it, gets it! (In the last two weeks, I've managed to avoid doing them all but once haha) We bathe our son together, take turns doing diaper changes, and while I end up doing more of the daytime feedings, he takes the 6am to 10am feedings each morning. I spend more time with him during the day - we both work from home but my job is more flexible than his. <br>  <br>  At first, my husband was wary of doing diaper changes, and tried to avoid the feedings. Basically, I wouldn't let him! I'd tell him that he had to know how to do it, and I would stand there at first, telling him how he was doing it right, and would offer a few tips/tricks here and there when he needed. After he got the hang of it, he'd offer me tips/tricks he found worked too. It's nice because we both can respond to what my son needs, and he doesn't prefer one of us over the other. <br>  <br>  That being said (sorry to ramble) but even now when my son cries and it happens to be my husband holding him, my husband gets that wide-eyed look of "oh no, what did I do to make him cry? What do I do now?". <br>  <br>  So, I can understand your anger at him passing off the baby, and I can understand his fear of being alone with the baby. I think you're right in wanting HIM to spend the time with your son - so perhaps he needs to be encouraged a bit more to do so, or maybe even speak to your mother in law about how HE needs to do it alone more often. (Perhaps go out for lunch with her so he doesn't have the option!) Also tell him that you want him to feel comfortable being alone with him and tell him that when he does do it, he is doing a good job. <br>  <br>  If he's avoiding spending time because he's just wanting to avoid doing it, well then I'd plant your foot firmly into his back-side! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4lXMkXA3aa	My husband is  a pretty big guy so he was nervous about diaper changes and anything that required movement of the baby. He did learn quickly how to make bottles and would take over in the wee morning hours. With time he took over diapers too!! Always been a great help and loves QT  with his son. |`|Gbs6Sa0haa	Like Noah's mom said he avoids poopy diapers but other than that he great.  But for the first few months I think he was a little nervous watching her by himself,  but now that she is 15 months old he will watch her for several hours shy mommy goes shopping.   He is probably a little nervous|`|tQVBDx5Paa	Well when I worked it really was 50/50....daytime and nighttime.<br>  Now that I stay home with her, he is more of a playmate.  He does not normally do mealtimes or diaper changes unless asked.  He is really busy though.....he gets home, plays with Emma and we eat, then he goes outside to work on our new house.  Probably the most he helps is when we are getting ready to go somewhere.<br>  <br>  EDIT - It seems like men get more involved as babies get older.  My hubby just said the other day that he can't wait until Emma can walk so he can take her places with him like to the barn to feed.  She'll be so cute in rubber boots!|`|1GXHgOXmaa	My husband was great with our 1st daughter.  We split it all about 50/50.  We have been talking about what we will do when number 2 is born in December and it looks like it will be the same split.|`|vrwFgpNKaa	i dont think he is scared i think it is lazy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i wouldnt be happy about that at all. if your close with your step mum maybe talk to her about it. |`|HF2HiUQJaa	I think most men are the same when it comes to looking after babies. My hubby is no different with my 10 month old daughter.<br>  He has changed  no more than 5  nappies since she was born and he has only every bathed her once and that was 3 weeks ago. I think the main reason is because us women do most of the work from the day the baby is born, one because we want to and two because we feel the natural instinct to bond with our child as much as we can while they are newborn, once the baby gets to that age where they are more independant and are hard to keep satisfied for long periods of time thats when we call on our hubbys for help, by this time however our hubbys have got so used to the fact that they never have had to do a think for bubs, that when they do look after them they have no idea what to do and it just frustrates them. <br>  I have a go at my hubby all the time about not spending enough time caring for our daughter but in all honesty I know that he is a man and at this stage he would much rather sit infront of the playstation or clean his car instead of looking after a fussy baby - they class that a chore and we all know men don't like chores. I believe it won't last though, once the baby stage is over and the toddler stage arrives I think that's when the fathers start to take an active role in the childs life, afterall, there is more fathers can do for a toddler than they can for a baby!|`|AA10167940	My husband is great with our baby.  I would say it's 60/40 with us.  He does do diapers but if they are super-loaded, he will let me know- lol  I don't mind doing it either because he makes a mess sometimes if they are really full-|`|pXSKSS3daa	Lol, he avoids poopy diapers like the plague! Other than that he is pretty good with caring for Noah when I ask, and even when I don't.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe he is nervous about having your son one on one. Ask him. Eventually he'll have to get over whatever it is that is keeping him from spending good, quality, time with your baby.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	My husband is absolutely AWESOME with our daughter! Not kidding. He changes her diaper, poopy or not. Gives her baths sometimes. Genuinely loves spending time with her. He puts her to bed most days. He works during the day so he misses her a lot so he comes home and usually enjoys hanging out with her.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	my fiance use to do that. he ahd to watch him like one or two weekends a month while i worked. during the week he was at my step-mother's. every weekend he was trying to pawn him off. i finally realized that he said he got really fristrated and nervous because my son was hard to take a bottle and got to sleep for him. anyway. he's much better now that he is older. when they are together they always go out and get a new toy or to the aprk or something|`|9eno55hCaa	Mine takes our daughter every night til 4am from 5pm.  so I can get things done, leave for a bit and/or sleep.  He took 12 weeks paternity leave and a months vacation to stay home and help with her.  She loves her "daddy time".  The only thing he wont do is diapers, unless he has to.

AA11659150	I bet you are feeling them low and primarily to one side or the other to varying degrees.  And they may be worse when you are tired.  Those are called round ligament pains.  In laywoman's terms, they are growing pains.  Your uterus is literally beginning to stretch to make room for that little baby you are making.  And yes, they DO hurt.  <br>  <br>  It is okay to take Tylenol for these (I promise), but it is also ok to ask your doctor.  You can also try a warm tub bath or a hot shower or even a heating pad (per my MD).  They get these questions all the time and I bet that is exactly what he or she will tell you it is.  <br>  <br>  Stay hydrated and try to change positions when you feel these cramps.  Sometimes that can ease them.<br>  <br>  If you are bleeding or in severe pain, you absolutely need to call the MD ASAP.  Otherwise, it's normal.  GL!|`|fWAzJIEkaa	YES!!! I am 5 weeks on Monday, and i get the cramps throughout the day!

yFG0NhD4aa	I'm w/ everyone who mentioned it above... the family medical leave act FMLA....  My brother used it when my sister in law had her baby a month too early, used up his vacation and sick time first (but, I think that may be a requirement, too).  <br>  <br>  Then, when I took FMLA, they have to guarantee you your same job, or a job at that leave, but not below it. <br>   <br>  You may also want to check the verbage in your company's employee manual.  For example, the verbage in my husbands technically reads that he gets 12 months off for pregnancy (because it never specified a female employees pregnancy!).  haha, not that my husband wants to stay home w/ me for 12 months, but, the verbage shows it's there.|`|AA12135528	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_le...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  To be covered under FMLA (Family Medical Leave Act):<br>  Must work for a covered employer (all public agencies; private companies with 50 or more employees within 75 miles.)<br>  Must have worked for covered employer for at least 12 months prior, and at least 1250 hours in previous 12 months. Other restrictions apply.|`|isokr9cfaa	yes, it's called paternity leave. Employers are required by law to give fathers paternity leave, but they aren't required to pay them for it. It depends on the job whether or not they will pay the father though. My husband took three weeks off and he just used vacation time. |`|OxFV92hJaa	My husband files for the Family Leave Act.

The woman is a math teacher, and he was a gym teacher.  Currently, I believe he is on "maternity leave," he periodically comes in to school as a visitor and brings their child, but I think he is still paid.|`|AA11117186	Technically, that's not the law for everyone. It only applies to some states. Anyway, I think men are covered under the family medical leave act (FMLA).|`|C9jjODJuaa	You can get leave if you are a guy.

You would have to check with your own employer to find out if such a thing exists in your area.|`|miPubuDYaa	Not by law. But some companies (here in NY) do offer something called Family Leave. It is one week (or two if you work for a great compnay).<br>  <br>  My former company offered it. One week per calendar year, must come with a doctor note. Wife had baby, daughter had heart surgery, ect. This company gave it paid. However any time after that was unpaid but you kept your position for 30 days. You could also take your vacation time the weeks after your wife has the baby.|`|DrlDqVZeaa	yea there is it's call paternity leave (in usa).

OgzHcNMsaa	Yes you should change drs...and for future reference, if your gut instinct tells you something is wrong,always get a second opinion. My cousin took my nephew to the walk in clinic because he has stomach flu. They said nothing was wrong and it will pass naturally. She took him to his dr and they made her go  to sick kids hospital to go on iv because he was so dehydrated.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Any doctor that says its allergies and gives you an antibiotics is clearly not communicating well with you.<br>  <br>  Antibiotics are only for infections, so either the doctor believed your child had an infection and just didn't clearly communicate that with you OR worse they gave you unneeded (from their point of view) antibiotics which puts everyone, but your child in particular at risk for antibiotic resistant infections.  Giving antibiotics to children under 1 also increases their lifelong risk of asthma, which is something that would be higher in a child if they had allergies -another good reason to avoid overuse.<br>  <br>  I can't comment on whether this doctor is a horrible doctor that no one should use.  But its clear there is a lack of communication and trust between that doctor and you and for that reason alone you should switch.  I also think because of the other doctors comments you should make a formal complaint to ensure that if there is a pattern of bad conduct from this doctor it gets caught.|`|5DJcir9saa	I would.  You took her in twice and they didn't even think to check about something as common as pneumonia?  I wouldn't feel comfortable taking my child back there.|`|eJ539ejpaa	If you are not satisfied with the care your child has recieved, I would change Dr's.

c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Some clinics will do that for a price but it is pretty rare. My clinic feels it is unethical unless sex selection is used to prevent gender linked genetic disorders.<br>  <br>  ETA: I feel the same way! Some clinics will do testing if the parents only want a given sex. I feel it is playing God and agree with my clinic that it is unethical.|`|vigFmfLmaa	Yes and no.  It's unethical to do so but clinics get around it.  Just know that if you have the genetic testing done (which is separate and additional to IVF) and only implant those female or male embryos you want you may be reducing your chances of any viable pregnancy.
AA10468184	No, sorry, no signs your water is going to break later in the day.  Only about 10% of women's water breaks on it's own (SROM - spontaneous rupture of membranes) in comparison to having the physician break your water, (AROM - artificial rupture of membranes).|`|Oq2B7I4faa	Nope I don't think there is any sign that your water is going to break soon.  Mine broke during the contraction and my sis in law just had her baby and hers broke at 2 o clock at night in the bed when she was sleeping.  It's gonna break on it's own without at notice.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	No signs for that unfortunately!
JOVWBOOCaa	Yes it is possible to see a line when it is not  there, it is heartbreaking! I must admit, I have done it myself. I have also seen many woman here do the exact same thing! That being said however, a faint line (if it is there) is always a positive! Depending on your average luteal phase and days between menstrual cycles etc an early preg test may or may not detect a pregnancy. The only early test that worked for me was First response digital (and only one of them worked before I missed my period) all the other test, I had to wait until I missed my period. I have a10 day luteal phase with 32 days between my cycles so I expected it! A good site to check out is peeonastick.com! It helped me through my dreaded 2 WW! Good luck!|`|04ZBuoqWaa	I've done that. You could try the Clearblue pregnancy tests. They're digital and easy to read. I took 2 of those tests and they were positive when my doctor's tests were negative. It took a blood test to prove I was pregnant. Clearblue caught what the doctors did not.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	lol, if i were you id just wait a day or two and retake it.. your HCG levels will be higher then and your line should be darker.. also try it with FMU|`|hIzQyflqaa	post a pic and ill tell ya!|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	Once i saw a line so light that I made it into a negative. It didn't change anything, I'm still pregnant! It's just not something I was expecting. <br>  If you saw any line it was probably there. Congrats!|`|vigFmfLmaa	To answer your question - yes.  I've seem women turn them upside down, sideways, shake them, view them in sunlight, even take pics of them in negative resolution all to 'see' a line that wasn't there.  I know it's exciting and if you see a line that sounds promising.  But do yourself a favor and wait until the day you should test and use fmu.  That way you can celebrate with no worries or questions!

(not all, but a good bit)<br>  It just amazes me when a child is wheezing, coughing, or gasping for air parents think it has nothing to do with their smoking.  Even if they don't smoke in the house the stench follows you around if you are a moderate to heavy smoker.<br>  <br>  The number 1 reason a child is hospitalized is because of asthma.  Number 1 reason why kids get asthma is because an outside allergen causes it....especially smoking.<br>  <br>  Edit:  FYI my grandfather died of tongue cancer caused by second hand smoke.

When did you go off the pill?  If it was recent, expect your cycle to be irregular for a little bit.  Pregnancy is not the only reason your period can go missing or be late though.  If you've made any changes in diet, exercise, or lifestyle, that can also throw your cycle off track.  If you've been ill or started or stopped any medications that can have an effect on your cycle, as well.  There's a multitude of other things that could cause a missed period such as stress, disease or infection (sexual, bladder, ect), ovarian cysts, etc etc.  <br>  Your best bet is to get in to your Dr.  S/he can do a blood test to test for pregnancy, and if you're not, s/he can go from there to figure out why you're missing your period.  <br>  Good luck!|`|iNWlJg4Oaa	It might be too early for the test to show. If you wait a couple more days and take the test right away in the morning after you wake up it is the best time to tell because if you are pregnant the hormone shows up better in that morning .. however it is also possible that you are late because you stopped taking the pill sometimes your body reacts differently. Good Luck|`|hOdd1Ti1aa	i dont know much about pregnancy but i do know that pregnancy test can give false readings because it happened to my mom with me so i would suggest getting another test and if you dont trust that one then go to a doctor and have your doctor do the test for you.|`|YXjuF6ppaa	I suppose it's possible. If you're a week late, the you would have gotten pregnant 3 weeks ago (or so). So a test should be identifying a pregnancy by now.<br>  <br>  Take another test, and see your OB/Gyn.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	A false negative could be likely.  Test again in a few days.  I didn't get a positive pregnancy test until my period was over a week late!|`|2HcDEQTIaa	Stress can make a woman be late on her period, so the false could be accurate.<br>  <br>  But on the flip side you may indeed be pregnant but too early for the test to come up as a positive. My advice would be to give it another week if you do not start take another test and if you get a negative see your doctor for a blood test which can detect pregnancy more efficient. <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	It's possible that you're pregnant but if you just stopped taking birth control it could also be from that and your body adjusting to the change. If you still don't get a period in a week I would make an appointment with your doctor and see if you can get a blood test done! good luck!|`|7KkTel7Oaa	possibly, but a woman will skip a period at least twice a year and it's ok. If you think you might be pregnant, wait another week and then take another test. Just don't stress about it because stress can make you skip a period.|`|m6GSXW40aa	Hey the same thing happened to one of my friends! Sometimes stress could cause it! u might want to go to the gynecologist and find out for sure. I would not recommend pre- marital sex though for that reason cause it just causes you to worry. Hope all works for u!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	it could be a false negative..give your period a week if it doesn't come, then get a preg test, or see your gyno....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|9pDEhA1Xaa	Take a blood test from the hospital if you have to know today!|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	Its possible. I got my positive at 6 days late and it was bold. lol.|`|hPo31hWlaa	Sometimes stress can delay the cycle.  Relax and in two weeks take it again. You are playing it close to put on a condom right before. Do you want a child? if not stop taking chances. Keep the condom on.
277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	Yes that is a possibility, but there are also other explanations.  like for example.  a baby that is bottle fed with only the left side against her mother every time she eats only looks left.  i've actually seen that one.  to help try to fix it, you can put things that interest her on her right side, which could be hard since she's two months.  if she has a little gym thing to hang toys off of, you could hang some of them right above her, and some slightly to the right, and lay some more on the floor next to her.  hope this helps and i really hope her hearing is fine.  <br>  <br>  also she could be fed with her right side against mom, forgot to put that down.|`|LYMhlUleaa	my ten mth failed her hearing test has been diagnosed with profound deafness so yes it is a possible if she looking to her left as that is where she will be hearing sound from u should tell her to get it tested again as hearing aids could improve her hearing and she could also have a cochlear implant.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	My daughter failed her hearing test period! And there's nothing wrong with her hearing. There are many factors involved that could produce a false result. Your daughter is probably just rooting (turning her head to look for food)|`|5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	That is sooo sad....she very well could be deaf/partially deaf in her right ear, thus the reason she looks to the left (the side she hears things from) so she looks at whatever she hears.  Awww, I hope she is ok, good luck to your friend.
JQZDCcyQaa	Once the tooth cuts, so when it breaks the skin, but then you have many more teeth to go through!<br>  My daughter was teething for a couple of months then two came through at the same time|`|9eno55hCaa	that can go on for a while.  Some babies teeth quickly while others take a long time to come in. It just depends on the baby.  |`|7XQwpBVaaa	We have been lucky my daughter is a "quick teether", meaning once they start coming in they come through quickly. She got her first tooth at 4 months and is getting her 14th tooth at 14 months of age. Just keep giving him tylenol and cold washclothes! |`|ki0yOklRaa	until the last tooth grows in
vigFmfLmaa	Yes it's too soon.  But you already knew that ;-) Wait until Saturday at least.|`|f6d8dc37df71815c0eda1576157c2ea3aa	I would say yes but the peeing more, that usually doesn't happen till mid/late pregnancy.|`|bd085f18e30718f81fc89a98e5419284aa	Could Be but you never know. I know you know to wait still af does not show to take a test I know very hard I hate that part. Hope You get a BFP goo luck
Bg6txvxqaa	I like Aimee-jade and actually, Jayden Taylor sounds nice together as a first and second name or as seperate first names Taylor Jay sounds nice too. <br>  <br>  Good luck picking out their names, we're still stuck trying to get 1 name we agree on lol and we've gotta pick 2 plus middle names lol it's gonna be a lot of fun!|`|tWKZVDG2aa	I am personally not a fan of hyphonated names but Aimee-Jade isn't that bad.  Bonus there is the nickname AJ.<br>  <br>  The problems is Jade and Jayden are really similar and sound the same.  So you basically say Aimee Jade Jade-n.  I would change the middle name of the first name so it sounded a bit different.<br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I don't like hypenated names - I do really like Aimee Jade though. Jayden Taylor is cute, I think Tyler would flow better. The name Jayden always reminds me of Britney's son though.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	My 2 favourite girls names are Jessica and Jade. Aimee-Jade is lovely. My next door nieghbours little boy is called Jayden Taylor, its a nice boys name not for a girl though.
QFNvYVtyaa	Before Ovulation (low chance of pregnancy):<br>  The first few days following menstruation, there will be little or no discharge present. You will feel dryness around your vulva. During this time, chances of getting pregnant are low.<br>  <br>  Approaching Ovulation (chance of pregnancy):<br>  The first discharge that does appear should be moist or sticky and should be white or cream in color. In the finger test, the mucus should break easily. You will only be able to pull your fingers about 1 cm apart before it breaks. During this transition time, first the mucus will become cloudy and slightly stretchy during the finger test (this means that it will still break before the fingers are stretched all the way). As time progresses, the mucus will become greater in volume.<br>  <br>  Right around ovulation (high chance of pregnancy):<br>  At this stage, mucus resembles egg whites. It is the thinnest, clearest and most abundant at this point in the cycle. Finger testing will allow the mucus to stretch quite a ways (several centimeters) before it breaks (if it breaks at all). ) The amount of this thin mucus will steadily increase until you experience your ‘mucus peak’. This is the last day of this period where the chance of conception is high. It is closely tied to ovulation. During this phase, the sperm’s survival rate is higher. It can survive in cervical mucus for up to 72 hours, a significantly longer time than during the rest of the cycle.<br>  <br>  After Ovulation (low chance of pregnancy):<br>  After ovulation, there is a marked change in mucus appearance. It returns to the sticky stage (does not stretch during finger test) and there is again a feeling of dryness around the vulva.<br>  <br>  One caution for this test is that sperm can be confused with the mucus secretions and you could make wrong assumptions. Also, vaginal infections, medication, and birth control can alter conditions and should be taken into consideration when examining any vaginal secretions.<br>  <br>  Cervical mucus plays an important role in enabling you to get pregnant. The most important role that it plays is that it facilitates conception by allowing fertilization to occur at a time distant from ovulation. The role of the cervical mucus is to nourish, protect, and speed the sperm on its way up through the uterus and into the Fallopian tubes so that it can fertilize the egg and help you in getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  A woman’s cervical mucus is different throughout her menstrual cycle and these changes in cervical mucus reflect her stage in the cycle. After menstruation, as your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The greater volume and changes in texture reflect your body’s rising levels of estrogen. You are considered most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. At this stage the cervical mucus can be compared to raw egg whites.<br>  <br>  Cervical Mucus – Healthy Reservoir for Sperm<br>  The vaginal environment is biologically a very hostile place for the sperm. The acidity in the vagina rapidly immobilizes sperm and makes them dysfunctional. The first level of protection that the sperm gets is by the man’s coagulum. After ejaculation, sperm are protected by the coagulum formed from a man’s semen. But this is a very short period of time. During this time, sperm, wrapped in coagulum, are transferred to the cervical mucus which protects the sperm from the acidity of the vagina. Sperm that fails to enter the cervical mucus in this short period of time become non functional. Although, women often worry about semen falling out of their vagina after intercourse, all useful sperm is usually taken up in the cervical mucus within this short span of time after intercourse.<br>  <br>  In the middle of your cycle, your cervical mucus provides a healthy reservoir for sperm.  Sperm, unlike ova, can survive for a number of days within crypts of your cervix.<br>  <br>  During most of the cycle the cervical mucus is like a thick plug for your uterus that prevents sperm from entering it. However, due to hormonal changes in your body during your menstrual cycle preceding the time of ovulation, the cervical mucus increases in volume and becomes thinner and more stretchy than usual. At this time, it allows free entry of sperm into the uterus and assists pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Cervical Mucus – Mobilizing Medium for Sperm<br>  When ovulation occurs, a single, mature egg or ovum is released into the uterus from a follicle. This egg is fertilizable for only about 12 hours after which it will begin to disintegrate, if not fertilized. During ovulation the cervical mucus becomes thinnest, clearest and most abundant and comes to your aid.  Sperm that have colonized in your cervical mucus through prior intercourse are now free in the thinner mucus to leave the cervix at any time and travel up into the uterus and through the tubes to find an egg. For most women cervical mucus functions in this way for at least two days prior to ovulation. In some women cervical mucus enables fertilization to occur up to a week before ovulation and pregnancy to still be able to take place.<br>  <br>  Cervical Mucus – Barrier to Abnormal Sperm<br>  The cervical mucus also acts as a barrier to abnormal sperm. An abnormally shaped sperm is much less likely to to be able to travel to the egg as quickly and easily as normal shaped sperm and actually can get slowed down in the cervical mucus. This natural selection process that takes place in the cervical mucus is effective in facilitating pregnancy in women.|`|JOVWBOOCaa	charting your cervical mucus is only one way of finding out when you are ovulating. It is not cervical mucus but the texture. Women almost always have cm but at some points drier than others, you can still get some to test the texture. It is the "egg white" cervical mucus that is what you are looking for. This is your most fertile time. However......I would recommend using Ovulation prediction kits, I used it once and I am pregnant with number 2! You can get them at walmart 20 for $20 (answer....it is what I used) They do have more expensive and more high tech kits but answer worked fine for me. It is less invasive and much easier! Kind of like cheating! LOL Well, hope this hepls and good luck!|`|AFxOZ0Hxaa	Generally, it means you are about to ovulate. Although OPKs and/or charting temps is a good way to cross-check this.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	it depends on the look and feel of the CM.. it changes with your menstral cycle...As your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The changes in the mucus that is secreted from the cervix reflect where you are in your cycle. The consistency of your cervical mucus changes during the cycle due to hormonal fluctuations. You are considered most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy. Many women compare mucus at this stage to raw egg whites.
o6ruEMVUaa	Lol. You betcha! It doesn't matter if she's been sleeping 20 min. or 80 min. She KNOWS I'm going to fall asleep. <br>  If her father is watching her, or its his time to get up with her, she sleeps just fine or goes back to sleep just fine. Lol.<br>  Maybe it's that I jump up at every little sound...|`|GomqF0bfaa	Lol, YES. JUST as soon as I am drifting off in to la-la land, he seems to make some type of loud noise or scream for a second. (which scares the living crap out of me) I end up going to go check on him and of course.. his eyes are closed and he looks like he is a content sleepy boy. Then I go back into the other room and he'll do the same thing over again. Little booger.. I think he likes playing games. lol.|`|D5dtvqb1aa	Yes! I always wake my 6 week old baby up to change and feed her before I go to bed. It at least allows me an hour or two of uninterrupted sleep..sometimes more before she wakes up again. Even if she only eats a little it tides her over longer than if I was to just let her wake up on her own. |`|nvnpoj10aa	My son is 14 months old and it still happens, not quite as often as it used to... Hopefully your child will grow out of it lol|`|NIevkj10aa	absolutely! also, he starts crying right as I feel I'm reaching my breaking point for tiredness/holding him. every time.|`|M6c0hUefaa	YES, YES, YES....I think babies just know when we're going to sleep, it's like they're thinking UH-OH I gotta get some food before she goes to sleep, lemme get her up! <br>  <br>  My daughter does this for what seems like almost every night, but probably about 4 nights a week. Hopefully she'll be out of that stage soon.|`|9eno55hCaa	Not for sleeping no....but our daughter screams the minute my husband and I are within two feet of eachother...we could even be in different room from her. its like shes got radar or something.,|`|4iXL4C6paa	Oh my gosh, I am exhausted right now.  As soon as I dozed off last night my 7 week was up like 30 minutes later. So after a long night with him, I had to hop up and get the other 2 off to school.  And as soon as I layed back down my 1 year old decides to pee in the bed, so Iam at work now trying my best not to fall out.  So yes it happens with me too.|`|dLLDwZaraa	When my daughter was new, she did this to me EVERY night, without fail. Id even crawl in bed and make excuses to get back up, thinking I'd trick her.  But as soon as I was down for the night, getting into a good snooze...she'd need me.|`|9gv1B73kaa	YES OMG YES! EVERYTIME!|`|TkSY2ZUfaa	Never, thank God.. I love my sleep
8Raw4M1naa	It takes time depending on your fertility and his. Try purchasing a fertility monitor (you can find them along with the pregnancy tests) to see when you are at your peek to conceive. It may take a couple trys, and consistancy in trying it what will make the difference. <br>  <br>  Some tests boasts they can tell you 5 days before you miss your next period, but thats the absolute soonest they can. You normally have to wait until you miss your period (or sometimes a bit after that) until the test will show positive.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, talk to a fertility doctor. The can test both you and your husband to see where the problem lies and offer solutions.|`|yB8djbeNaa	you have to wait till one week after your missed period! you aint gunna get pregnant over night it doesnt work like that wait till middle of march|`|vigFmfLmaa	You're testing way too early.  Tests don't show positive the day after you have sex...  You should test around March 2 or after, about 2 weeks after ovulation (assuming you have a 28 day cycle).  How long have you tried?  You shouldn't be worrying anything about infertility unless you've TTC for a year or longer w/out conceiving.  It can take that long for perfectly healthy fertile couples to conceive.|`|gb4beCZTaa	wait until around march 2nd-march 11th to take it. if you still think your pregnant then go to the doctor... and remember... on those tests, there isnt such thing as false + but there is alot of false -|`|2n0B4cY6aa	it would show earliest of 2nd march, sometimes it wont be for 2 weeks from that...<br>  its too early to tell
1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	unfortunately it sounds an awful lot like a chemical pregnancy.  That is basically when an egg gets fertilized but does not implant.  Hormones get released giving you the positive test result, but eventually without it implanting properly the pregnancy is terminated by the body.  This happened to me at five weeks along, two positives, then two days later negative.....three days after that negative my period arrived with terrible cramps.  But...just six months later i was pregnant.<br>  <br>  Call them, you won't be bothering them.  That's what they're there for!<br>  <br>  I hope I'm wrong!!  Good luck!!|`|MAh2yKFnaa	I am sensitive to crying too...we should watch a sad move! I don't ever know if it is pregnancy or if it is just my period playing tricks. I would get a first response test and try that and I would bother my dr if I were you!|`|f6yeTcmxaa	No, go ahead and test again.<br>  Its alright.<br>  It wont hurt.<br>  Yeah and call.<br>  I know this because my sisters going through the same thing.|`|wZyRPutYaa	sorry to say but you are def knocked up

I lost my mucus plug 3 days before my son was born, and then I had false labor about 1 week before he was born. I would make sure my bag is packed, I had my labor plan ready, house cleaned, and everything in order!

oVxr5B3Eaa	If you only had unprotected sex less than 2 weeks ago NO pregancy test would show a positive. Wait like another week or 2 and take another one.|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	You may be pregnant and it is too early to tell with a urine test at home. You are having many of the early pregnancy symptoms, but some of these are also related to PMS before your period starts. I would wait a week or two longer, if symptoms persist, and then take another test. Or you can call your doctor and request a blood test to be done. Blood testing will detect a pregnancy earlier on than a HPT urine test.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	take another test in a few days if you don't get your period.|`|ihL0FkJYaa	wait a week and test again
xV0APOtaaa	My daughter just turned 2 this last Saturday. (My due date was this coming Saturday) so I know exactly how you feel with the weather.<br>  <br>  Do what you believe is appropriate, everyone will adjust. They are there to celebrate her birthday...not judge what she's wearing. Your daughter isn't going to know the difference anyway.|`|toqMrT25aa	No i wouldnt be schocked but like everyone said you can put tights on her for the dress. <br>   I put my daughter in a dress at the beginning of her party cause i wanted to , not because it is the right thing to do . But a dress just made  her a bit more dressed up than the usual pants . Then after i put her in a casual outfit so she can run around and play  . but hey it is your baby and your party . do what you want |`|9eno55hCaa	i just get legging style pants or heavy tights on my daughter when i want to put a dress on her (shes only 12 weeks though so its easy to put layers on her)<br>  <br>  I think whatever you put her in is fine though, the notion that little girls should wear dresses for certain things is just silly.|`|H3BIj2Msaa	that is really none of their business. Being 'shocked' by something you are doing is really rude unless you are truely hurting another person|`|H41u0B8Jaa	Of course I woudn't be appalled....I would think nothing of it. It is not mandatory for a little girl to wear a dress and you are absolutey correct she will be able to move around better in pants and will be warmer.   |`|s6emVQleaa	No, I wouldn't be appalled.  However, if you do want to put her in a dress and are worried about the weather- just put some heavy tights on her.  Walmart by me had a bunch that were $3 and super cute.
9eno55hCaa	Having had miscairages myself, i know as well how that feels...I would give her a few weeks to deal with her grief.|`|0OTV0a4Zaa	my first pregnancy was a miscarriage,and i just couldn't bare the thought to be aroound anyone pregnant because it just reminded me of what i lost. i was angry at anyone having a sucessful pregnancy because it made me think there was something wrong with me. if you tell her to soon after her miscarriage she might think your being inconsiderate, but she might also be very happy for you.  i would give a a couple of weeks to come to terms with what happened,and try to tell her by herself instead of telling her with alot of people around.that way if she does get upset she wont have the embarrasment of everyone seeing.  a miscarriage is something you never get over,it only gets easier in time.don't be suprised if she still gets upset or doesn't act very happy for you,she is happy,just upset still.<br>  congrats.<br>  good luck|`|irP2yTMWaa	I would just tell her it was different but when my daughter was 3 months my sisters daughter was stillborn at full term i was so guilty that i had a baby girl and hers died but we talked it through. She then got pregnant with twins and lost one but the other was ok (a girl)and was born two weeks early a year to the day that her baby girl was stillborn.I then started trying again and had a miscarriage in april 07 found out my friend was pregnant i was happy for her i then had an ectopic removed 3rd aug 07 then got pregnant and had my baby boy june this year he was late.Each time anything has happened we always talk share the smiles and the tears i would tell her|`|kfCVRyVjaa	I think it might be sensible to give her a couple of weeks but don't wait so long that it looks like you have kept this from her.<br>  <br>  Only you know her, so only you will really know how she will react.  Some people can handle other people's happiness when they are grieving and some people can't.  |`|TYnhzSAPaa	hard to say. it will take longer than you can wait for her to get over it.<br>  i m/c in dec 07.my best friend got preggo in jan 08, and i just found out a couple of months ago that my sis is having her fourth child.it's still really hard for me.
DIcxJbaKaa	You should pump 2 minutes after the milk stops coming out. If you empty your breasts the milk that comes in next has more calories and fat in it rather than if you only pump for a little bit and dont empty them. |`|mygpnrK1aa	I thought the duration DOES matter. I started off by pumping for 10 minutes and wasn't getting much. Now I have to pump for a full 20 min b/c there is still milk coming out. Every woman is different though. If you pump 1-2 min after the last drops, that will encourage more milk production the next time you pump. |`|9eno55hCaa	How long you pump for has no impact.  I pump for 15 mins but thats because thats how long it takes for the milk to slow or stop comming out.  sometimes its less, sometimes its more, but I find myself having to pump every 3 hours or more to keep up with the baby.  I generally pump everytime she eats, but sometimes its a bit more so I can build ip a bit of a supply for her in case she decides she wants more than we have on hand.|`|prYIJZJPaa	im not a women...but...im pretty sure its definitely Yes....women who pump less or stop pumping all together...stop creating the milk.....my friends wife stopped pumping / breast feeding after the first week cuz she wanted to smoke.... she said her breasts were already milk free a month later |`|7QjlDvs6aa	not that im aware of I was over due with both my boys by a week, With my 1st son I has so much milk i could have feed a small country lol and with my second who is 8mths old I had enough just  for him lol|`|G0qkBsBkaa	It doesn't matter how LONG you pump but how OFTEN you pump. The more OFTEN you pump the more milk you will produce and your baby won't need any formula.|`|774cd4b792f5a99de1d8c6c1f2a5860eaa	yes it does when you nipples are stimulated weather it be in the shower or by your pump the body thinks it is your baby needing food. This make your body produce more milk. If you pump for a long time your body thinks that the baby need that much milk so it produces it. This also works the opisite way to if you do not pump or feed then you body will think that you dont need the milk so it will stop the production. 
Mjni0Np3aa	she doesn't care about you. you don't need her. move on and find a girl that will actually care about your feelings. not some b**** that will come running when her other relationship doesn't work out|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Well, that sucks! Confront her and talk about it, maybe she is confused.?|`|VjRNVBOsaa	ok look if the girl does not like you she does not like you all you have to do is tell her that she was an *** to screw you over and then get over her and find the next best thing there are plenty of fish in the sea :D

AFxOZ0Hxaa	It could be! Especially if you don't have any more spotting. Take an early preg test!
a8IRxC4raa	Yes, it is.  What's even more gross is the whole idea of requiring permission to use the bathroom.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	That's a valid complaint & shows some really good thought processes on your part.  Why not write it up as a persuasive essay, along with some valid solutions to the problem (that take into account the need for passes and the need for ease of use by the teachers), then present it to your teacher & the principal.  You may be the catalyst that's needed to make this change for everyone's best interest.|`|0e9e0fd70c4104cae7d4bb923534c3baaa	Keep a mini bottle of instant hand sanitizer in your backpack/pocket/purse and quit whining. Restroom passes are to make sure that students aren't wandering the halls and causing problems. Yes, it's kind of gross, I work in a school and I get passes handed back to me that are wet and it makes me cringe, too but safety and knowing where students are is more important than complying to the complaints of students.|`|CrZxYK5raa	yes take it to the head of the school get it changed  that's why so many kids  get sick and miss school. you have a very good point i say stand up for what you believe in and fight for it!|`|8nGptJZAaa	Totally gross. But I got an idea for you. Why don't you buy some clorox wipes bring them too school have it stay there and every time you go back to the you wipe it down.|`|02ouBqEdaa	Totally gross are school every one has there own but you can only go 3 time a month per class|`|5sGTexy7aa	at my school the pass is paper and we flush them if the teacher makes us take it with us
EOaAQVdSaa	No, and I'll explain why. When you get your period, your body is flushing out the lining of the uterus that it worked all month to grow, in case you were to become pregnant. That lining will stay in your uterus if you become pregnant to protect your baby. If an egg is fertilized, the cells will split and become an embryo, which implants into the uterine wall, causing something called implantation bleeding, which is not quite as heavy as your normal period. it is usually only a few streaks of red blood. If you spot brown blood, this is normal too, because brown means it is old blood and not a problem. Bleeding throughout your pregnancy is cause for concern, and you can not get your period when you are pregnant, even if you hear about someone's friend's wife's cousin having one. It is a myth.|`|S4DNQkFraa	It's possible for some woman, yes.|`|dq9uclgpaa	some women are known to get a small amount of blood throughout their pregnancy. some only in the first trimester. My mother had this in her first trimester|`|AA11783671	Yes, though it's not as likely.  My grandmother was 6 months pregnant and didn't really know it because she continued to have her period all the way through the pregnancy.  She thought she had a tumor and it turned out to be a baby boy!|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Well it wont be your period but you can have period like bleeding. See your doctor though and make sure that everything is okay!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	yeah...there are some women out there that HAVE NO IDEA they are pregnant....because they get thier period when it si supposed to come....<br>  <br>  Good luck with everything!!|`|6ErVPePEaa	when my former boss was pregnant she still had her period for 6 months.She had no idea she was pregnant|`|jkFZb2aYaa	for some woman, they do still have bleeding, however it wouldn't be a period.  if you are pregnant and bleeding though...call your doctor just to make sure everything is all right.|`|jdJ74Hjaaa	Yes but why would you haha
AA11659150	I know what you are talking about.  If they are on your nipple itself, they may actually be sebaceous ducts (oil glands) that keep your nipple from drying out.  (As the milk only comes from the center of the nipple itself.)  They do serve a purpose.  AND they do become more prominent during pregnancy.  I have noticed them on my own.  (TMI... LOL)<br>  <br>  I would not worry about this or get stressed out.  If they are still there to a degree that bothers you post delivery, your doctor can probably remove them.  (Although, my bet is that as your hormones go back to normal, they will retreat to their normal size.)<br>  <br>  Most true skin tags, I think, occur in areas of friction (as the gal above suggested) - bra straps, genitals, underwire and underwear areas, etc.  <br>  <br>  This is certainly worth mentioning to your doctor, but if he/she says it's normal, don't worry about it.  Pregnancy does so many wierd things to your body.  <br>  <br>  I am really getting ready to have mine back to myself!!! LOL.  GL!!!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	I've experienced this. It's normal. I even got them on the undersides of my arms, in between my legs, on my neck. I read somewhere it's usually in areas of friction...|`|kVIOtS5gaa	I had one on my left nipple and tore it off. lol i dont know if i was supposed to or not but it has not grown back and my nipple is fine.|`|AA10458750	I have one right between my thigh & some where else...TMI...lol...Anyway, the Dr. said it is caused by hormones & they can be removed after pregnancy.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	I got one on the top of my thigh. I had it removed after I had the baby. The cause is pregnancy.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	are they at the bottom?...<br>  <br>  I have those!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  I don't think about them though...|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I have them pretty much anywhere my bra rubs my skin- they are driving me crazy. From what I understand, it's hormones.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm 9 weeks pregnant and have the same thing..noticed it last week. I guess it's common in pregnancy, yet annoying. I hope they go away!
nQ7ZcUI3aa	YES I think that it is beautiful and unique Azalea Leigh is great. And you can nickname her Azal. Cute!!!!|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I think its unique and meaningful.  When you find a name (like Azalea for you) that you love then it stays on your mind.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I think it is super cute... you could call her leah for short.<br>  or you could name her Zelia?|`|RI1brp91aa	I like it, it's very pretty.<br>  <br>  You could nickname her:<br>  <br>  Lea<br>  Aly<br>  Ava (replace Z w/ V)<br>  Aza (like Ah-Zuh)|`|fXzed3fLaa	No any flower name is delightful.  I live in southern SC so I know how beautiful they are.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	I think that's a really nice reason to use the name, and I think it's pretty as well.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Sure- it has special meaning to you both, AND it's unique and pretty without being weird. (there are TONS of people named Rose, Violet...all after flowers. Why not Azalea?)|`|prllht3vaa	That is just the cutest thing ever! ADORABLE! :) <br>  Her name will be very special to you, very unique and precious. <br>  <br>  The best of luck! :)|`|eJMIazhLaa	I think it is a good name for a little girl.  I know a little girl with that name and she's just the sweetest thing!|`|qERAKF13aa	i think its perfectly adorable! go for it!|`|6v4Gblxkaa	I like the name. ....|`|65RZ441Zaa	yes, so graceful and pure
EOaAQVdSaa	For me, I didn't become sick or anything at first, that came later. What got me was the sleepiness and sore breasts. I felt like I got punched in them! I was at my sister-in-law's place one day and I was talking about my period late, and how all the stress of moving was affecting me. That night, we watched a movie and I fell asleep right after I sat down. I thought it was stress messing with me, but later she told me to get a home preg test. She was right, I was pregnant. I had no idea those were symptoms, since my breasts usually get tender right before my period. Me and DH tried for exactly that long.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	TTC 18 months. My first symptom was cramps, which I chalked up to AF coming. Never came, I finally took a test and got a BFP. I'm now 20 weeks.|`|HvoOeTVuaa	Well, my pregnancy was unexpected.  My husband and I were not ttc.<br>  <br>  Before I knew I was pregnant, I  began having TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE headaches in the lower back of my head.  Paired with the headaches was constant nausea.  I began tracking my headaches and nausea in my planner because I knew something wasn't right.  I never considered pregnancy until my mom asked me if I was pregnant.  I took a test later that day and got a positive RIGHT AWAY!  LoL.  I didn't even finish peeing on it!<br>  <br>  After doing some quick math, I decided I was about 6 weeks pregnant at the time of the test.  I was experiencing the headaches and nausea for about 2 weeks.|`|8mchLCQhaa	With this baby I had symptoms the 2nd week I was pregnant and didn't know I was pregnant yet. The one that I had was extreme hunger! With my first child i also knew at 2 weeks because of how badly my breast hurt. I tested at 10DPO and was pregnant both times! with my first I didn't TTC at all with this one I tried for 3 years.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	My husband and I decided to try in the beginning of November and we found out we were pregnant on December 1st.  We were lucky and felt extremely blessed.  I got a positive result on a home test 7 days after my missed period.  I was between 4 & 5 weeks.  The only symptoms I had were fatigue and mild cramping.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!  I hope this is your year!!!!!  :)|`|96HWpdkFaa	Instantly I got sore breasts ..this was before I even tested to find out I was pregnant...It happend so soon. Then I started getting headaches, around 7 weeks got nauses and have to pee alot. Now alot of symptoms are the same.<br>  <br>  I'm 9 weeks right now, and My husband and I have been married for 6 months got pregnant within 4 months of being married.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	My husband and I worked so hard to conceive for about a year. Everything was perfectly fine for us, except I never knew when I ovulated because my periods were crazy. So we quit trying for a few months, I got off caffeine, we both started eating better, I started taking pre-natal vitamins. That's when we got pregnant. I don't know if all the things we changed in our lifestyles had anything to do with it, but you never know. My early symptoms were sore boobs, felt like I had the flu, exhuastion, mood swings. I got all these symptoms as early as my 3rd week. Took a test when I was 5 weeks along and that explained everything.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	My earliest prego symptoms were nausea, sides hurting, exhausted no matter how much sleep I got. My hubby and I have been trying for close to 2 years. I found out last night I am. Since the doctors estimate your due date by the first day of your last period, I am technically 5 weeks along. All the doctors pee tests were negative, so I requested a blood test, and the doc said there was barely any hormone to register, so I might have conceived maybe a week ago.|`|a65ec070ac47cd090dc1218e138ac837aa	For me, I started feeling horrible menstrual-like cramps around the time that my period was due. They persisted for about a week. That whole time I kept thinking that my period was going to start but it never did. Then about 2 weeks later my face started breaking out very bad, terrible nausea all day and night long, loss of appetite, extreme sleepiness, and one day of light brown spotting. After the one day of brown spotting I took a test and it came back positive. I took 2 more a couple days later and  they came out positive too. I still have bad acne breakouts, nausea all day and night, and extreme sleepiness. I'm 8 weeks pregnant. Good luck! :-)|`|Cxdxo393aa	i am 12w1d...my earliest symptom was honestly as cliche as it sounds i just felt pregnant, like something was different.  i took a test and sure enough...but then it definitely started with nausea and breast tenderness in that order for me.  then the fatigue.  nausea = 3w, breast tenderness = 4w, and fatigue = 5w.  hope this helps!!!  i had been ttc off and on for over 3 yrs!! o yea, also i got a MASSIVE pimple on my chin and started getting red rash looking spot on my normally clear face before all the other symptoms hit.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	a god awful headache that lasted 3 days until i realized i was a week late... as soon as the test was positive the queasiness kicked in tho!|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I wasn't TTC but I started getting the symptoms around 3-4 weeks|`|LggMpuQIaa	HE was my little surprise. I was so tired I couldn't make it till 9 before going to sleep. omg and the heartburn OUCH  I was 9 weeks|`|ybexjS2Paa	Being extremely tired. I couldn't keep my eyes open and I didn't even know then that I was pregnant. I'd say I was about 3 weeks far. TTC 3 years.|`|3ab796e59e654e494e3c24254858129baa	Well first off; You could say I was trying to conceive for about 1 year and a couple months and found out I was pregnant in January! I'm 12 weeks along and my first symptoms were my average PMS symptoms, but much MORE severe! <br>  <br>  I had crying spells for about a week and had no reason for them, just over anything! Definitely had tender and sore breasts in the first month 1/2, some cramping, & EXTREME fatigue! That was mostly it, no implantation bleeding for me & my morning sickness & nausea  didn't come until about  6-8 weeks and haven't had them since! Thankfully!<br>  <br>  But that was pretty much it; I did also eat a little more and had some food cravings for chocolate, but that also went away after the 8th week for me! <br>  <br>  I was about 4 weeks when I found out; but those early symptoms came when I was about 2-3 weeks.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! Don't lose hope! I know you'll be a mom soon! <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. I actually stopped ttc so much & didn't think about it & that following month I got pregnant! =)|`|BVJ0tNbraa	In Auguest we decided to go off the pill. I was lucky enough to have it happen right away which suprised me since I was on the pill for 17 years. My husband thought I was crazy but about two weeks after conception and not long before my period was due start I started having cramps. I told him I didn't think they were the typical "period" cramps.. felt like the "shop was open for business" almost like I could feel the wheels turning (my body working as you will). I know it sounds insane but I just knew it was different. Then my boobs started to hurt! They still do and now I'm 28 weeks pregnant with a boy!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Actually in all of my pregnancies my first sign of being pregnant was feeling like my period was coming any second...literally running to the potty with a tampon in hand and nothing showing!  The rest started I'd say around 6 weeks...nausea...sore boobs...tired...YAY! lol|`|2RNFbJAPaa	Less time than you, but I know plenty of ppl who had to try for as long as you and now have kids too.  First symptoms were missed period and tender breasts.  Nausea and tiredness pretty soon after.

neJbYkJoaa	You should call your baby's doctor's office and ask to speak to the nurse.  She could get more detailed info about your symptoms and maybe check you for strep.  Usually, it's just localized to your throat, but she could get more details that would help determine the best precautions.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	yes you can still nurse in fact it's better for you to nurse him- things like that are not transferred through breast milk and you pass immunological benefits to him. When you're sick jsut make sure you wahs your hands and what not|`|g15tHbCCaa	you can still breast feed. He wont catch it unless by  contact of the throat, or nasel fluids that have already been infected.  other than that, he wont catch it!|`|g7r4W2vRaa	Definitely continue breastfeeding him he will get all the immunities your body is making to fight your infection and that will help to prevent him from getting sick. Just to let you know a baby getting sick is not the end of the world it happens and it will happen a lot. but the best thing is to continue nursing him.|`|w4zjmhxoaa	Sure he can breastfeed -- that's the best thing for him really, it builds his antibodies.  I know that before 2 years, it's really rare that a child catches Strep throat.  I'm not sure about tonsillitis.  Continue to breastfeed though!|`|LPW2IoaHaa	go and see a doctor.<br>  he will tell you for sure.<br>  if yourr worried<br>  x
5e8276e29e4038d2a3b299690bb756e5aa	I was feeding my 8 1/2 month old daughter her stage 2 foods and I was like "Man, this stuff is just as runny as stage 1."  I don't think there is any difference, you just get more in a jar.  At 5 months, I am sure it wouldn't hurt him.  Good luck.|`|qrfJ0ffiaa	In the UK, stage 2 food has lumps in it, my daughter completely skipped this stage, she wouldnt eat the lumps. Try him with it though, theres no harm in trying!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	stage 2 is just thicker|`|Y7xlBWdsaa	I haven't noticed a change in consistency. I've some times found the stage 2's green beans to be runny. I'm sure that's based on the brand. Other than that, the portion is bigger. <br>  <br>  Yes, you can feed it to him if you notice stage 1s aren't filling him up. I changed my daughter to stage 2s once she mastered all the flavors. During the introduction stage, she was eating two containers.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Not much except that its usually a bit more expensive, just a way for them to get more money out of you.<br>  <br>  Usually stage 1 is a single food (like bananas) whereas stage 2 can be mixed (mixed fruit for example). Stage 1 is often in 2.5 oz containers whereas stage 2 comes in 3.5 to 4 oz containers. And stage 2 may be a bit thicker, depending on what food it is.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	yea he can eat it, it is a bit thicker so watch him to make sure he isnt having trouble swallowing it. also sometimes it has ingredients that are not to be introduced too young, like berries.   check to make sure that you are giving him foods that he has already had before without a problem.|`|h93SVSxLaa	it's a tad thicker and there is just more in the jar... he'll be fine with the stage 2|`|mAxChwHTaa	i think the only difference is that its a bigger portion... dont feed him all of it
reO9Dgmsaa	This is 100% normal.  Some babies want to be held more than others!  My daughter was the same way!  :)  Her first 7months she was attached to me nearly 24/7, through babywearing and cosleeping.  <br>  I'd suggest trying both of those, so you can go about your day to day life, and then sleep well at night.

Wrap him up tightly (Not to tight) with his arms at his sides, rock him gently till he falls asleep and put him down kinda on his side.  My daughter can sleep up to 4 - 5 hours now sleeping that way.  Used to be only 2-3 hours but at least it was better than no sleeping at all.<br>  <br>  If he starts getting fussy then "shhh" usually works well with most babies if its kept at an even tone and pace.  Something about making them feel secure and in the womb kinda things helps sooth them.|`|417c8c8ba60765aba0388d43c628cd9baa	It is very normal. When he wakes up just go next to him and sing to him or just show him you are there. He will eventually get used to the fact that mommy is always there. My son did that and now  he is a great sleeper (though he hardly ever naps, he sleeps 10-12 hours at night) I wouldn't stress this so much at nap time though, because as i said, my son rarely takes naps now. <br>  <br>  Just relax and it will happen! |`|gasRWPwMaa	Have you tried giving him Cow & Gate's Good Night Milk?<br>  <br>  Or try giving it milk for older babies, Itll make her/him sleep longer.

5N3odm3Qaa	A few corrections to some answers on here:<br>  <br>  1. Starting at age 14, your parents no longer have any right to your medical information. Everything that happens to you after you turn 14 is completely confidential. You're covered under HIPAA laws and nobody can violate this. At 17, you can go anywhere you want.<br>  <br>  2. Lab work (like bloodwork and such) will usually run about $15. Not $100 for someone young who is just getting standard bloods drawn. By the way, just from standard blood work they will test you for seemingly every last bit of information, from cholesterol to pregnancy to diseases.<br>  <br>  Your local community hospital has a clinic which will be of very little cost to you, regardless of whether or not you have insurance.<br>  <br>  Any medical center or university hospital would be fine but you can also go to Planned Parenthood. At PP, they use a sliding scale for payment so some things might be free to you if you have no insurance (or don't tell them that you do) and have very little to no income.<br>  <br>  Go to PlannedParenthood.com and do a search for locations near your zip code.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6bc1daa67c2e712a9d1fdf83a2a7f067aa	you should tell you parents as soon as possible you need to see an OB soon to make sure everything is fine you wont be able to hide it for long|`|WOHc22Xiaa	Either wait til your 18 or tell your mom because you need to 18 for your first appointment.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	I don't know but they are going to find out sooner or later- might as well be sooner.|`|SVqjzEE3aa	i'm 17 too....<br>  <br>  i live in El Paso..I just go with my hubby...he's in the army so he has to be my gaurdian.

If you are sure that you do, then you ABSOLUTELY do not need to be going.  Maybe your husband can wait until next year to go?  (I turned 30 during my preg too and it sucked that I couldn't go party, but hey we all make sacrifices, right?  I'll make up for it next year!  LOL)  <br>  <br>  Second, you are going to get dehydrated and your feet will hurt as will your back.  You will have to pee constantly, etc. etc.  I really, really think it would be better if you spared yourself the discomfort as much as I am sure you want to be there.  Hopefully, if you talk to your husband about this (sometimes they forget how much work it is to make their babies... ha ha), he will agree to a compromise that is fun for both of you and a rain check for Six Flags.  Especially if you make it clear how much you want to enjoy his birthday with him.

Sometime they don't want you to take a trip because anything can happen when you are so close to the due date.<br>  Too travel 100 or so miles from home is not wise.  How far will you be away from the hospital that you will be delivering at?  Don't take Chances. Will your husband wait three months after all he can still celebrate his birthday. Think it over and talk it over with you Doctor.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	there is really no need for  a wheel chair.  walking is good for you.  i went to the rodeo here in houston 3 weeks before my due date.  just take a seat when you need to rest while the others go on the rides.  have fun!

zhJOZhKEaa	I second the website recommendation of the first poster.<br>  <br>  It gives the following 'rules' and futher info for safe dieting while breastfeding:<br>  <br>  1. Wait until your baby is two months old before dieting<br>  <br>  2. Breastfeed without restriction<br>  <br>  3. Eat at least 1500-1800 calories per day<br>   <br>  4. Keep weight loss at less than 1.5 pounds per week<br>  <br>  5. Decrease the calories gradually<br>  <br>  6. Avoid quick-fix solutions<br>  <br>  ETA:  So basically... your plan sounds very reasonable.  :)|`|Btsctjydaa	It's ok with me as long as you have nice boobies.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	As long as you eat to hunger that's fine (you can eat mainly fruit and veg)  just choose your foods well.  You might want a bit more whole grains.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mom-weightloss.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...</a><br>  Six guidelines for safe dieting during lactation<br>  <br>   Wait until your baby is two months old before dieting<br>  It's best not to do anything consciously to lose weight until after the second month. This gives your body enough time to successfully establish a healthy milk supply that is less likely to be adversely affected if your caloric intake is restricted. Breastfeeding your baby, on average, burns 200-500 calories per day (above what you needed to maintain your pre-pregnancy weight) -- so keep in mind that even without a weight loss program you are burning extra calories.<br>  <br>   Breastfeed without restriction<br>  Research tells us that both more frequent breastfeeding and breastfeeding longer than six months increases maternal weight loss.<br>  <br>   Eat at least 1500-1800 calories per day<br>  While nursing, you should not consume less than 1500-1800 calories per day, and most women should stay at the high end of this range. Some mothers will require much more than this, but studies show that going below this number may put supply at risk.<br>  <br>   Keep weight loss at less than 1.5 pounds per week<br>  Most moms can safely lose up to 1.5 pounds per week or 6 pounds per month after the second month and not affect milk supply or baby's well being. One study has suggested that short-term weight loss of 2.2 pounds (1 kg) per week is not a problem (in this study, moms dieted for 11 days).<br>  <br>   Decrease the calories gradually<br>  A sudden drop in calories can reduce milk supply. Some moms notice this during an illness, although dehydration and/or medication use could also be a factor in reduced milk supply when mom is sick. It has been hypothesized that a sudden calorie decrease can cause mom's body to go into "starvation mode" and cut nonessential resources such as milk production.<br>  <br>   Avoid quick-fix solutions<br>  Liquid diets, low-carb diets, fad diets, weight loss medication, etc. are not recommended while breastfeeding.<br>  <br>   <br>  What might happen if a nursing mother loses weight too quickly?<br>  <br>      * In most instances of too-rapid weight loss, it is not the breastmilk (composition or supply) that would suffer, but mom's nutrition and/or health.<br>      * Excessive dieting can result in a reduced milk supply.<br>      * According to Breastfeeding and Human Lactation (3rd Edition, Riordan, pp 440), it is noted that fad or rapid weight loss programs should be avoided because fat-soluble environmental contaminants and toxins stored in body fat are released into the milk when caloric intake is severely restricted. I was unable to find a definition of "severely restricted" but I expect that it is significantly under 1500 calories per day (which they called a "modest intake"). I've included information on a study on this subject below. See also the info at this website regarding environmental contaminants and breastfeeding.<br>  <br>   <br>  Three great tips for weight loss (whether you are nursing or not)<br>  <br>   Make dietary changes -- decrease your fat intake to 20-25% or less of total calories; keep your protein intake up to prevent loss of muscle mass (Recommended Intake of protein for nursing mothers is 65 grams/day for the first 6 months and 62 grams/day between 6 and 12 months).<br>  <br>   Spread your calorie intake out -- instead of 2-3 meals, eat 3 smaller meals with snacks between. Your body will be less likely to go into "starvation mode" if you are eating small amounts throughout the day.<br>  <br>   Exercise moderately so that you burn more fat while keeping lean muscle mass. Resistance/weight training is a good way to build muscle mass. A person with more muscle mass burns more calories, even when resting.<br>  <br>   <br>  Specific weight loss methods<br>  Weight Watchers, Body for Life<br>  <br>  Weight Watchers and Body for Life are generally considered to be fine for breastfeeding mothers. Weight Watchers has a program specifically aimed at nursing mothers. As always, avoid cutting calories too abruptly or losing weight too quickly.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mom-lowcarb.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/mom/mo...</a><br>  High protein, low carbohydrate diets like the Atkins diet and the South Beach diet are very popular. These diets can be helpful for diabetics and people with gluten intolerance. In these diets, protein and high fat foods are not restricted; vegetables are limited. The main difference between Atkins and South Beach seems to be that the South Beach diet is less structured and emphasizes eating healthier, mostly unsaturated fats.<br>  <br>  The primary objections I've seen to these and similar diets -- and this applies to everyone, not just nursing mothers -- is simply the fact that they are not balanced and thus have the potential to make you feel unwell. These diets tend to be low in phytochemicals, antioxidants and folic acid. They also tend to be low in fiber and minerals (including calcium, magnesium, ph|`|AA10888290	here is some great info...|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	That sounds great!  <br>  <br>  If you want something a little more structured, Weight Watchers has a nursing mom's program that worked really well for me.|`|66KUgS24aa	it sounds ok, <br>  you probably should still ask a doctor though|`|df9YbPDpaa	I started an excercise plan one week after I gave birth, and my diet the day I gave birth.  I ate 1800 calories, enough to support breastfeeding.  A lot of women are just too exhausted to start dieting and exercising after birth, but there's no reason you shouldn't.  Especially since you're baby is 9 months old.  I don't personally see a problem with your diet, because all those fruits and veggies can be nothing but good, but make sure you're eating at least 1800 calories (spread out evenly throughout the day, 6 mini meals), I think the average breasfeeding mom burns 2300 calories a day, so that would be a 500 calorie deficit.  You'll be fine, think of all the celebrities that drop weight right after birth because their careers depend on it, and a lot of them were breast feeding, and their kids seem to be in good shape:)

Or they'll just sit in them, pretend it's a car, boat, etc.<br>  Make a big batch of play doh... definitely keeps them amused.  Especially if you have a rolling pin and some cookie cutters.<br>  Sometimes I'd just fill up the bath, plonk in a heap of plastic toys and they'd spend ages in there playing underwater world.<br>  Second hand shops are good... you can get cruddy old boxes and knick knacks really cheaply and let the kids paint all over them.<br>  Find out if there's an indoor playground near you.|`|AA10325228	cook with them<br>   make some crafts<br>   dance to children songs<br>   make a fort out of chairs and blankets and play in it<br>   watch movies<br>   color<br>   play board games|`|HWiuRgNxaa	go get a big roll off paper. trace their body's and have them color them. color wonder finger paint is awesome also. do flash cards with them. make board games out of silly stuff and use their photos as game pieces. bake something with them.|`|29755a8ebc6914e582dd9140d3f07868aa	Play Doh and board games are great.

They then play with some toys or puzzles for a few hours.  Around 10.30 we usually go for a walk or to the park - even when it's cold they like to be out in the fresh air and tend to go a bit stir crazy if the weather is really bad and they can't go out.<br>  <br>  When we get back they usually both take a nap for about 1 hour and then have lunch.  After lunch we often draw, although the baby gets a little bored and tends to just play with his toys on the floor.  Twice a week in the afternoons I take them to a local playgroup, I didn't know anyone when I started but they were so friendly I couldn't help but make friends there and it's nice to have some grown up conversation.<br>  <br>  When we get home around 4ish I let them watch tv whilst I prepare dinner although sometimes my two year old likes to help which means it takes longer.  After dinner some more playing on their own whilst I do dishes and tidy up and then baths and bedtime for 7.<br>  <br>  I suppose I play with them for about 3-4 hours per day but I also think it's important for them to mix with other children in order to develop certain social skills.  If there were no playgroups around by me I would send them to daycare one day a week as it is important for me to have some "me time"<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x|`|wHOQXToHaa	I understand-  I stay at home w/my 2 year old son and sometimes I just want "me" time, although that's not the reason I stay home! LOL!  Here's a big list of things I do to keep him occupied. Playdoh, Color Wonders markers, fingerpaints, build forts inside, Jumbo lego blocks, I bought him a mini trampoline, coloring books, moon sand, crafts with glitter & messy stuff (my son loooves messes!), special bath fizzes & bubbles & toys- it gives you a break and the kids can spray the tub like crazy with foam & stuff, our library has story time once a week for kids in different age groups, we have a local children's museum also, see who can build the tallest block tower, my son LOVES mr. potato head, simple board games- even if they dont "play them correctly", make cards / letters for daddy at work,  magna doodle boards for drawing, my son loves his train table and tracks, puzzles, little basketball hoop, bake cookies or make their own pizzas, let them take pictures w/a cheap digital camera & make a photo album of it, I started collecting all different kinds of puppets that even my 2 year old enjoys, I can't remember who makes it & it's almost $100 but it's a bicycle that you hook up to your TV, and the kids have to ride in order to play the educational games- it's Soooo cool! have them "help" fold laundry, dye eggs- even if it's not easter, make kites to run outside when it's warmer, adopt a pet-even if it's just a fish, and yes- tv time is always a nice downtime when you or the kids are tired! make popcorn & let them watch it pop on the stove, the list could go on forever. I just try to think of small things that take up time in the day- my son loves taking our vacuum cleaner even and making noises in the hose (weird I know, but it keeps him occupied!!). make musical instruments and play them......google ideas if you get bored of what to do with your kids! :)|`|7KkTel7Oaa	I'm not a stay at home mom, per se, but I do have to stay with them during the day (I work evenings). For days that you can't go outside and explore (in the cold, yeah, feasable, huh?) you could let them color, start an indoor garden (i just planted seeds today with my kids), talk with them, let them help you cook, yell at them (heh sorry, I had to throw that in, since kids and mom all go stir crazy) listen to the radio with them, make sure they don't fight, get them to play games with each other, let them help you clean house (little kids love matching socks, trying to fold clothes, and mine are fascinated with sweeping the floor. Danged swiffers)<br>  <br>  just anything that comes to your mind when it comes to kids, if it doesn't hurt them in any way mentally and physically, can be done.|`|yJOZn4wqaa	My daughter love to be read to, loves to color, and sometimes a movie can hold her attention.  <br>  <br>  Do some arts and craft, like making funny faces with colored macaroni.<br>  <br>  I still struggle with ways to entertain my child. <br>  I found that <a href="http://www.starfall.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.starfall.com</a> works to entertain as well as teaching your child.<br>  <br>  We did put ours in a "pre-school" and we noticed the changes.<br>  Hope this helps!!

I do that a lot. My kids love pancakes so I cook up a bunch of them then wrap them and freeze them, that way you can just pop them into the toaster or toaster oven to heat them and its cheaper than buying those store bought ones that come prepackaged. You can also cook and freeze things like Hamburger Helper, Tuna Helper, Chicken Helper, Tuna casserole, and Meatballs. For an 8 month old you could cut up bananas into bite size pieces. Cheerios come in a bunch of different flavors also and are a good snacking finger food.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	My son is 23 months old and meals that likes and that I regularly make and sometimes freeze are:<br>  Mild vegetable curries (with chickpeas, coconut milk etc)<br>  vegetable risottos<br>  stir fries with tempeh<br>  Vegetable frittatas<br>  omelets<br>  spaghetti bolognese (you can use mince or red lentils)<br>  vegetable sticks with dips such as hummus or guacamole and cheese<br>  My son also likes couscous and vegetable salad with crushed nuts. For lunch he regularly eats nori rolls and rice paper rolls (with sliced vegetables and avacado).<br>  Most children of this age also like mince with vegetables, broccoli or cauliflower cheese, macaroni with cheese (and hidden veggies)<br>  <br>  For your 8 month old, sliced steamed or soft fruit fingers,  fingers of steamed vegetables, slices of cheese and avocado all make great finger foods.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	We have always just fed our kids whatever we were eating, so I don't know that I have any specific toddler meal ideas, but I can list some things that my kids like.  (I have a 5-year-old, a 4-year-old, and an 18-month-old.)<br>  <br>  Any kind of pasta is great for toddlers (although it can be messy), and pasta works pretty well as a finger food for the 8-month-old, too.  (You might want to set plain noodles aside for him/her, depending on what type of pasta you're making.  Lasagna obviously takes a little while to make, but you can make a huge batch and freeze it in individual servings wrapped in foil.  <br>  <br>  Something else I like to do is cook a whole chicken in the crock pot.  I don't add a lot of seasonings/spices (just dried onion) so that we can do whatever we want with the meat later.  The meat is very tender, so it's perfect for infants and toddlers to pick up and chew.  Then, we either eat it with BBQ sauce or ketchup, put it on quesadillas/fajitas/tacos, add it to chicken salad or a casserole, use it on sandwiches or homemade pizza, etc.  It gives a lot of variety and usually lasts a few meals.<br>  <br>  My kids like fish (orange roughy is a hit here), and all I do is bake it - nothing fancy at all.<br>  <br>  Oh, my kids like rice, too, so chicken fried rice (my husband makes it - yum!) and stir fry go over pretty well.<br>  <br>  Breakfast for dinner is another good one -- pancakes, eggs (my 18-month-old likes scrambled eggs with cheese), French toast, omelets, etc.  Add some fruit and/or yogurt as side dishes, and the kids are thrilled.<br>  <br>  My kids also eat almost every fruit (fresh, frozen, or canned) and a good variety of veggies.  My oldest child's favorites are sweet potatoes, corn, and raw carrots.  My middle child loves green beans (only the canned kind), peas, raw carrots, and celery with Ranch dressing.  My 18-month-old likes raw veggies best (carrots, celery, cucumber), with or without Ranch dressing.  He also likes cooked carrots, peas, green beans, and lima beans.<br>  <br>  As for the 8-month-old, fresh fruits and cooked veggies (esp. no salt canned veggies) are a good option.  Small pieces of chicken, bread, and pasta work pretty well, too.  Wow, it's amazing how quickly I'm forgetting what my kids ate at that age.  I know that with my 3rd, we had a mesh feeder, and he loved to eat cantaloupe out of it.<br>  <br>  Hope that gives you a few more ideas!|`|oiJITSNZaa	vegetables and fruits! if you get them used to this diet when they first start eating, you will have toddlers that love vegetables and fruit even more than meat.

From what I've read and heard you shouldn't put the cereal in the bottle because it can make the child overweight and not teach them the proper practice for eating.  Mix a little bit of the cereal in a bowl with the formula and feed it to your baby with a spoon.  If the "tongue thrust" is still present and the cereal gets spit back out, the baby is not ready for cereal.  I've heard that around 4 months is a good age to start cereal.  The juice thing is wrong (especially at 3 weeks!)  If anything you should have tried a little bit of karo syrup in the bottle.  If I were you, I would look into a new doctor though.  |`|61eadcf38f72b14203ed398198796d52aa	The problem is that there is conflicting research.  There is no research showing that giving your baby food early will cause allergies, but there's also no reason not to wait if they aren't showing interest in eating.  My doctor told me to start my daughter on Cereal at 3.5 months - I took her advice because she knows my daughter and even though I know doctors aren't "God", they have been to school for years to learn about ho who care for children.  There are times when we can read something on the Internet and get one thing out of it, but a doctor understands the 13 other things that are a part of it that we know nothing about, so they are more qualified to make a decision on it.<br>  <br>  As far as the juice goes, my doctor said no juice until 6 months because it's too harsh on their tummies.  We're not going to give juice at all since it's not necessary.  We were advised that if my daughter had constipation problems (I breastfeed so it's 10+ days AND obvious straining/tummy ache) then we can use a half a pediatric glycerin suppository.  <br>  <br>  Basically what the feeding thing boils down to is that your individual baby has to be ready for it, and you have to make a decision about who is right - it's not the first such decision you have made (vaccinations, cloth or disposable diapers, etc).  <br>  <br>  Personally, I would suggest waiting since your baby is on formula which has iron in it.  Breastfed babies need extra iron sooner because there isn't much in breast milk.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Is it possible that she reacted badly to the juice because you gave her too much?  They can't "drink" it at that age, but you can give them tiny medicinal quantities at feeding time.  And, as you noticed, pear juice is good for the bowels at any age.<br>  Don't change the formula - give her a week or so to get adjusted to the change.  And if she has any more trouble doing her doos, give her a baby-size glycerine suppository.|`|7PHvaUy8aa	You can start babies on rice cereal at 4 months, IF they need it. If you do start them at 4 months, hold off other foods till 6 months. Just give rice cereal, mixed with her formula.<br>  Your doctor doesn't sound like any ped I have ever met. Giving a 3 week old baby juice is ridiculous. It will fill her up, and give her no nutrients. Good for you to trust your instincts, and switch the formula.<br>  I would continue what you are doing, if it makes you comfortable. I would suggest though, starting cereal from a spoon, not in a bottle. Mix is very liquidy, and if she cannot eat from a spoon, she is not ready for solids.<br>  Do what makes you feel safe. |`|9eno55hCaa	Your best bet is to trust your instincts and listen to your baby.  Nothing else matters.  <br>  <br>  Everytime a doctor does their research they keep comming up with different answers when it comes to babies and solids.  In all honesty its thier opinion.  This is why every doctor, every report is different.  Just remember that every baby is different and pay attention to yours, she will give you clues about when she is ready for solids.<br>  <br>  putting her fists in her mouth and seemingly trying to chew them after having a bottle or breastfeeding.<br>  still acting hungry after feedings, even after being given extra.<br>  being able to hold up her head on her own, and opening her mouth for a spoon is a must as well.  I would not give my 13week old daughter solids right now, she can turn over, hold up her head for the most part, but shes not ready.<br>  <br>  Every baby is different, every baby has different needs...trust your instincts.<br>  <br>  btw...giving a bitof juice or a bit of water (?oz) to a constipated baby is not abnormal, they gave my daughter this in the hospital at 4 weeks old because she had not had a bowel movement in a few days and it was clear she was very uncomfortable.  I would not let them give her a laxative.|`|XZxNQSlVaa	she does not ever need rice cereal, ever. she will be fine with just formula until she is 6 months old, and at that time you can start her on foods with more nutritional value, like veggies. My friends do the apple juice thing but their baby is older. At my son's 4 month old check up they told me it would be safe to start solids but advised against it so I didn't. I also asked if I could give him juice because I wanted to, and for some reason his doctor was against it til 6 months. He told me pedialyte was ok once a day at most and to use glycerin suppositories when he is constipated.|`|ZOQnUQGsaa	Okay so I would wait on the cereal till at least 4  months of age, and make sure she can sit up on her own in her high chair without being propped up with pillows or blankets. If she can not sit up on her own she is not ready to start eating cereal! it may cause a serious choking hazard!<br>  <br>  As for the juice, I can't believe he suggested that! Similac advance was hard on my sons tummy as well I had to switch to a lactose free formula. Which did wonders for his tummy! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I might consider switching pediatricians. Yours sounds a little old school. <br>  <br>  NEVER EVER PUT CEREAL IN A BOTTLE. That too is a choking hazard. You are supposed to mix the formula in a bowl with the rice cereal and spoon feed it to your baby. If they can push the cereal around with their tongue that is another sign that they are not ready for it.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|hFQa24wOaa	The rice is just to thicken the formula.. My daughter had acid reflux as a small baby, I was instructed to use rice cereal to thicken the formula. She was about 3 months when i did this. It does not harm to them, may even keep them fuller because its thickened. <br>  <br>  I think you should change doctors.. evert check up I went to.. I got a newsletter with all the information I need for the current month. What to feed, how much.. all that stuff. |`|isfWOPTDaa	Listen to your instinct and your baby!  I am a first time mum as well and everyone has an opinion and they are all different. So you have changed her formula and she is doing well, that was your instinct and it worked. I knew when to start my son on baby rice, I noticed he was no longer satisified with a bottle and was waking more often for more frequent feeds. My Doc said to go ahead and do what I felt comfortable with so at 4 and a half months I started to offer baby rice puree from a bowl (made with formula) at every bottle. He loved it and a month later was on 3 small meals (pureed pumpkin or pureed carrots, that kinda thing) a day plus smaller bottles. By eight months he was on full meals and snacks and only had a bottle at night. At one he gave up his bottle. I let him lead me to an extent, I knew he was ready by the way he was and my instinct said to try him. All babies are different so watch her and try not to get too hung up on what other peoples babies are doing or what advice is around. You are her mum and you know her better than anyone.|`|l9k3Iyhqaa	idk but i would start interviewing other pediatricians he doesn't seem like he cares. When my 15 day old son was 12 hrs old he had a 101 fever, pediatrician recommended a full septic analysis ending with a spinal tap BUT refused to look at my child BEFORE the tests were to commenced to see if they were needed.<br>  <br>  after getting s 2nd & 3rd opinion it turned out that our room was too hot and ALL the layers we had put on him had elevated his temp.  the moment we stripped him down to his diaper his fever went away n did not comeback.... ur pediatrician sounds a lot like mine.  that is why i changed him i suggest u do the same
c73QkZ2haa	I dont see the problem with swaddling her if that is what she enjoys...I did it until she didnt want to stay in anymore which was around 5 or 6 months....the girls in your neighbourhood must not have as cuddly a baby as you do...I love swaddled babies they are the cutest....Id say do it till she isnt comfy with it anymore. :D|`|9eno55hCaa	who cares what the girls in your neighborhood say or think as long as your baby is still happy (What are you 15?).  My daughter loves being swaddled and Ill tuck her into those blankets till shes 4 if she wants me too (i doubt that will be the case but...)<br>  <br>  Why is it unfair to you?<br>  <br>  It should be unfair to your daughter that you dont want to make her feel secure so the girls down the road will stop laughing at you.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	it's fine to keep swaddling her at night, i swaddled until about 4.5 months but some people do it much longer.<br>  <br>  one thing you can do is start swaddling her with one arm out (alternate arms every night) so she gets used to having an arm free.  eventually she will be able to sleep without it.<br>  <br>  don't worry about what anyone thinks, you are doing what she needs and that is what is best.<br>  <br>  |`|pgIlctcUaa	All kids are different. I would continue to do it. I wouldn't worry about what your neighbors think. Its none of their business.  But if your really wanting to stop the swaddling because You want to, then try holding her with a normal blanket just laying over her. Also, you can just put her in the sleeper an let her cry it out. I know it sounds harsh, but she really won't be hurting. It don't hurt your baby to cry. I mean i wouldn't let her do it for hours an hours,but chances are she will stop crying after about half hour. You will have to work on it every time you lay her down to sleep. Try putting her to bed in the swing until shes asleep, then move her to her bed. Try a car ride till shes out and then putting her in the bed. She will get use to it after awhile. Something like that's just like breaking them from the bottle or any other thing you have to break a baby from, it takes time. <br>  But don't do it because your neighbors are snickering, its none of their business!|`|bZWbwyn4aa	For some babies, it is their security.  I wouldn't worry about what everyone else says.  My own kids hated it, so while everyone else was swaddling, mine weren't, and I was the brunt of jokes for that!!  You just can't win!<br>  <br>  Seriously though, all babies are different, so don't worry about it.  She will let you know when she is over it.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	now.. or a month ago
8zdPI8Qsaa	When my son was born I was filled with awe and wonder, the desire to protect him, and overjoyed to finally have him here with us, but I definitely wasn't anywhere near as in love with him as I am today. My love for him is still growing daily... (he's 14 months now) and sometimes I feel like I could burst!|`|uRImc3Qnaa	When my first one was newborn I didn't think it was possible to love him any more than I did at that time but NOW I have so much invested in him he is so cool in ways I didn't think possible, and I can honestly say I love him and his brother more and more even though I didn't think it was possible.|`|7Rf1ju2Eaa	Of course it's normal. You love your baby more and more each passing day. And when you have more children, the love just multiplies. It's a wonderful feeling. |`|Bes30dZPaa	With both my children, I loved them at first sight.  But I love them more and more everyday.  So you are completely normal.

With my first I was so exhausted and sick that when I held her I was in robot mode. We eventually got to know each other and have an unbreakable bond. (she's 4)<br>  With my son it was a little easier, but yes I love him so much more now than when he was first born. (He's 8 months)|`|9eno55hCaa	I didnt really want anything to do with her when she was born. Well not entirely true.  They just took her away so fast I didnt even get to see her for the first 5 hours.  Then only for a short time before they moved me to another ward.  it was days before I got to see her...so her and I missed out on some much needed bonding time I think.<br>  <br>  But Shes growing on me lol|`|Ck2AhfTRaa	yes. except more now. hes almost 3 and i am in more pain then he is when he cries or gets hurt or bullied. i just love him so much.|`|AA11113671	i love my baby even more!

kOowil7haa	Emma, how far along are you?  I completely understand your worry as I am also a diabetic with an unplanned pregnancy.  <br>  <br>  The only thing you can do is pray, wait, and keep those sugars down now as best you can.  I'm not familiar with the UK readings (that's what that is, right?).  If so, your 14 translates to our 252. Now you know that is too high, both for you and baby.  But the lower average is better.<br>  <br>  Stressing out will make your blood sugars worse, and cortisol (stress hormone) doesn't do the baby any good either. So make an effort to relax.  I'm at 21 weeks and just had my midway ultrasound, and they haven't found any problems.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the high sugars increase your chance of a problem, but they are not a 1-1 guarantee of a problem.  Keep your chin up!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	If your doctor's not worried, then relax!  It's normal to be worried if your pregnancy's unplanned and you've not taken the best care of yourself.  I know all about that!  But really, if the doctor isn't worried, neither should you be.|`|9eno55hCaa	you should be fine.  Your baby should be fine too.  Work harder now though to control your blood sugar because you dont want to increase the risks of your baby being too large.  I am in the same boat, but Ive been pretty good keeping my diabetes pretty much in check. I try to keep it between 6 and 9ish.<br>  <br>  If your concerned go talk to your nutrisionist and the doctor.  Also the hospital near you may have a diabetics specialist who deals with pregnant women.  Thats what I did.
oTtAhewkaa	deja la tristeza y alegrate ya que tenes el mejor regalo que Dios nos dio, un hijo no es ninguno siempre se sale adelante, cuidate y te deseo mucha suerte.|`|a92152bad2455a9f1dde6876d0ecfc23aa	yo tambien estoy sacando sola a mi bebe de un mes, el padre se agobio al principio pero despues me a estado llamando e incluso la vio, yo estoy decepcionada con el muchisimo pero eso no me impide star feliz con mi hijita que la quiero con toda el alma,<br>  que nadie te estropee esta etapa tan maravillosa<br>  <br>  animo y piensa que no eres la unica que esta en esa situacion|`|z64tY1Tdaa	Concéntrate en darle la atención necesaria a tu bebé, aleja de tu cabeza (aunque se que es casi imposible) al hombre que te abandonó y aprovecha el coraje y el dolor para olvidarte de el. Mi esposo abandonó a mis hijos desde hace 6 a?os y lo peor es verlos llorar aún ahora por alguien que se olvidó de ellos, tu bebé por lo menos no lo siente ni lo comprende, mis hijos viven su desprecio y abandono, aprovecha eso para hacer feliz al bebé, las madres somos los seres mas valientes y fregones capaces de sacar a nuestros hijos adelante aún por encima de nuestro dolor. No te dejes vencer por la tristeza, al contrario, piensa que fue mejor que se fuera ahora y no después que tu bebé ya estuviera encari?ado con el y sufra por no verlo. Levanta la cara, eres la mejor mujer que le pudo tocar a tu bebé como madre, así que no defraudes a tu bebé, debes ser fuerte porque eres lo único que tiene, y la única que lo va a defender de todo y de todos.

No eres la única, pero claro que serás capaz de salir adelante con tu bebé, que pena por el que se pierda la oportunidad de disfrutar de la paternidad. Las mujeres somos más fuertes de lo que los hombres creen. Los bebés siempre son una bendición, ya lo veras. Con esfuerzo saldrás  adelante. Acepta tu situación y deja de estar triste porque se lo trasmites a tu bebé y no querrás un bebé deprimido verdad? Pon buena música y relajate. Cuida tu alimentación. E imagina ese en tus brazos, mirándote a los ojos e imaginando cuando re diga MAMá, es algo que no tiene precio y no todas tienen la posibilidad de disfrutarlo.|`|IeTFEHiraa	Todo va a estar bien Flor dormida, ánimo que ahora tiene al lado tuyo el ser más hermoso que pudo salir dentro de tí y que las amas por sobretodas las cosas, incluso el que padre sea tan tonto y no quiera campartir con su hijo los mejores momentos de su vida.<br>  Cuídalo mucho y protégelo, vas  aver que todo pasa, hay un dicho muy lindo que dice así:<br>  POR MUY LARGA QUE PAREZCA LA NOCHE, EL AMANECER LLEGARá!!!!!!!!!!|`|RZh52vCgaa	a cuerdate que ahorita te sientes asi, por que te siente sin protección pero, trata de salir adelante, por esa criatura. que si tiene tu cari?o y amor, con eso sera el bebe muy feliz, y te sentiras orgullosa de que el algun dia te valore por todo lo que hiciste por el, asi que fuera lagrimas que tienes que salir a delante bye|`|zuInAe84aa	Lo que puedo aconsejarte es q no te sientas mal ni te martirices por una persona que no vale la pena, pinsa que de algo te libro Dios al quitartelo ya, imaginate si el bb se hubiera encari?ado con el, de igual forma se hubiera ido y hubiera sido peor, piensa q los bebes absorbe toda la tristeza de su madre, tienes una razon fuertisima para luchar, sigue adelante y dale las gracias a Dios por ese angelito que tienes|`|Aiw6mmewaa	No debes de estar triste, por el contrario dale gracias a Dios que tienes lo más importante que es tu bb, que él está bien y sobre todo que te tiene a ti dispuesta a luchar por él, Dios sabe muy bien por que hace las cosas y si te quito a ese hombre de tu camino es por que van a estar mucho mejor sin él que con él, preocupate cuando tu estes enferma y creas faltarle a tu hijo y temas dejarlo desamparado, pero mientras tu estes con él, no le hara falta nada, de tener un padre irresponsable a no tener nada, creeme que mejor nada y te lo digo por que yo tuve a mi padre 6 a?os de mi vida, despues se fué y nos dejo y más nunca se acordó de mi, y fuí una ni?a feliz sin él, por que cuando él estaba solo estana borracho y haciedno suffrir a mi mamá.<br>  Sé que duele el que alguien no quiera a nuestros hijos y mas si es su padre, pero la vida todo lo cobra.<br>  <br>  Yo tengo una frase que siempre digo "Dios dale a mi hijo mucha vida y salud, que de hacerlo feliz, me encargo yo"<br>  <br>  Y eso es lo que te digo "Tu tienes en tus manos la felicidad de tu ni?o, no el papá".<br>  Suerte.|`|C00lGyIpaa	Manda a la chin gada a quien te reproche.<br>  <br>  Estás viviendo algo lindo LA DICHA DE SER MADRE.

Ahora con el maldito, tienes que hacer lo siguiente, buscate un buen abogado de familia, que no solo le obligue a reconocer al ni?o, sino que lo obligue tambien a mantenerlo junto con vos. Si lo quiere ver luego ya es su eleccion, y a esto no debes obligarlo ya que no puedes exponer a esa humillacion a un hijo pero que lo mantenga porque si le va a faltar el padre por lo menos que no le falte nada material, de esta manera con el tiempo el sabra que luchaste por sus intereses, por su bienestar y le estaras ense?ando a luchar por lo que es suyo. Y el patan todos los meses al depositar sufrira por su equivocacion.

Por ahora ponte en tu lugar, amarrate los pantalones y a sacar a adelante a tu nene, nada de voltear atras, ese bebe tiene que convertirse en lo mas grande en tu vida y por tanto conviertelo en tu centro para salir de esta situacion...

Her eyes should be open some but not all the time while she is awake.|`|RdIwtjURaa	I think you should get a new doctor. |`|1h9DYByQaa	it is normal for a baby to sleep 8-9 hours a day thats all they do is eat and sleep!! i know my kids did.. as they get older they become more alert but yeah i would say that she should be abit more alert by now and be able to open her eyes.. i would seriously get a second opionion, the conjuctive itius should have cleared up by now.. instead of using drugs you could try cool boiled water with the cotton wool and wipe toward her nose to clear it away. <br>  <br>  from what you describe i am worried.. please get her to another doctor as soon as.. or even consult your health visitor if you live in the uk! <br>  <br>  best of luck i hope she is ok.. xx|`|ea7379eec8394d01173d903dae7fa3bdaa	As a mother you sre to worry if you feel at anytime that your doctor is not helping or giving you the right answers you should always get a 2nd opinion with out thinking twice about it, Me as a mother of 3 went through something like that but it was just to me my daughter looked sick and was not herself when she was about 5 months old the doctor just kept telling me that it was nothing just a small cold maybe but i wasn't happy with the answer, so i took her to another doctor and got a 2nd opinion and turned out that she had an infection in her blood and need to be treated right away with 2 shots that had to be given to her exactly every 24 hours if i missed a moment they would have had to start the treatment all over again. It was something that i just knew was wrong with her.<br>      As a mother we just know so if at anytime you feel like something is not right check it cause you are with your child 24/7 and you know what is normal for your child not anyone else. So i think you schould follow your instinc|`|tXlBbcxwaa	My daughter was born with a gunky eye to and i used to use a little milk on cotton wool and that used to help.<br>  With the sleeping thing my 2 were the same always sleeping and i had to wake them for a feed and change my health visitor just said they were lazy babies and nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  but i also agree with everyone else if your unhappy with your doctor seek a new one.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
HclKftzAaa	The main reason they do it is because the recovery from the surgery is better at this young age. It also helps to create a sense of normalcy for the affected baby.<br>  <br>  If this happened to us, i would have the baby tested to see which sex it is genetically, and then decide what to do. It would be hard for me to want to make the baby one or the other, as I am able to see people for themselves, regardless of their sex, and often times don't think of myself as male or female, just a person. And man, i would be so jealous of my kid, how awesome would it be to have a penis AND a vagina!! I always say to my hubby 'I wish i knew what sex felt like for you.' I would be able to find out if i had a penis, lol. But i'm just a horny little devil... so maybe it's just me :P|`|8yTP3jO8aa	First, that is very rare.  Second, one gender is always going to be more dominate.  That's what determines which gender is used.  It's not like the doctors (or parents) are there playing God.  One gender is obviously the main gender and the other secondary.  <br>  <br>  Second, you mentioned your belief in God.  God doesn't make two gendered spirts.  A person's spirit/soul/self is always going to just be one gender, male or female.  A male spirit in Premortality is going to be a male in mortality and the same for females.  That means that it's impossible to choose which gender you are, even if you have both anatomies.  People are either born male or female, correctly.|`|E1wolGTFaa	I understand where you are coming from and I am not trying to have all the answers but I had a friend whose Daughter was born that way and they made her a female because her organs were female not male. So they usually go by what is in the inside as to what is the best way. But there have been parents to wait it out and let their child decide but it is rare.|`|AA12269056	dear babylima,<br>     this is a total dilemma, and i see you have a great heart.  i wish i had an absolute answer..but i am human and do not .  all i know is GOD is love and we are to be like HIM...so we  should attempt to let everyone be as they are, help when we can, guide , teach ..but most of all, love.............|`|tFjBztJwaa	they decide by body parts, sorry there can only be two ways
9eno55hCaa	I have already had this question from my mother-in-law and a few other people about when my husband and I will have another.  I personally dont plan on it at all.  I had an awful pregnancy, an even more horrible labor and even though my daughter is only 11 weeks old I KNOW I do not now nor will I ever want another one.  She was premature as well which increases the chances of me having another premature baby I cant deal with that.<br>  <br>  I dont think your being awful or selfish.   Your the one who has to carry the baby and care for it afterwards.  When people start telling me I should have another one as soon as possible I tell them, sure you carry it, you have it, and you take care of it...Ill come get it when its 5. lol|`|choy9OSeaa	im always pressure by my husband for more children (which of course i want more) cept my son is only 7 months and like you said i didnt have a very nice labour either .. plus im still getting used to things with just one child ..<br>  <br>  its like "give me a while" .. lol|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	You aren't awful or selfish. You should do what your body can handle. Your child will not be alone all the time. Do your sisters have kids? If so he can play with them! Don't put more on your self than you can bare! Good luck.|`|nbSp469Waa	You are NOT selfish at all!!!  Your baby is 6 months old, give yourself time.  When my son (he's 10 now) got around 18 months, I must have been asked a million times when I was going to have another baby.  It would drive me crazy.  Like you I had a great pregnancy, a few trips to the hospital for preterm but nothing major, but my labor was horrible.  I was very content with my baby boy, both my husband and I were content with just one child.  When he turned 3 I started thinking that it would be awesome to have a daughter.  So my husband and I played with the idea, we decided why not, well I ended up losing that baby, so I thought I was meant to only have one baby.  Then almost 2 years later we had a baby girl.  I thought I was done then too, then 5 years after her we had another girl.  Like I said before he is only 6 months old, enjoy him.  That's why I absolutely love the age difference between all mine, I was able to truly enjoy them being infants and toddlers.  Also, there is NOTHING wrong if he is an only child.  I have a few friends that are the only child, and they turned out perfectly fine.|`|7XQwpBVaaa	I had my daughter 14 months ago and I got my tubes tied the day after I had her. Not because of an awful pregnancy or labor but because I know that I can only afford to raise one child and pay for one college fund. <br>  I do feel a little guilty like you because my daughter won't have siblings.<br>  I am a nurse and when I have a patient with only one child I make it a point to ask them if they felt cheated or ever wished they had a sibling and to my surprise no one has said that they had.  I guess you don't miss what you never had.<br>  I don't think you are awful or selfish. Just relax and enjoy the precious baby you have!|`|TQScv7Tcaa	YES i am constantly asked "when r u going to giv eher a sibling" and like you i had a very hard time adjusting to being a mother ( a horrid pregnancy and a disaterous c-section). My mother was an only child and constantly tells me how lonely she was and that im horrible if i dont have another child. I would have another child but my partner doesnt want anymore and i go through phases where i really really dont want another child and then i do for a little while. You are not awful or selfish, everyone is different and every family is different....if you were to have another child that you really didnt want (just because people tell you you should) that in my opinion would be worse. Good luck and tell those sticky nose busy bodies to mind their business :)|`|Byu6kLgmaa	My son is not even here and people are asking when we are going to have another one. I am currently on bed rest b/c my body cannot handle pregnancy. I also had a stillborn child at 19wks. That type of thing takes a toll on you mentally and physically. We don't want anymore children for these reasons but I don't feel I have to explain that to everyone. It's not selfish or awful. It's your choice. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about a decision you have made for your life. I make no apologies for only wanting one child. That's my right as well as yours.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	No, you're not selfish or awful.  Plus, your boy is 6 months.  You and your family need time to get into a routine and used to being a family.  If you feel inspired to, maybe in a few years, then have another.  <br>  <br>  I have been pressured to have no less than 4 kids by my mother in law.  I just have told her (and my husband) that it is us that needs to make that decision- not her.  So if we don't have 4 kids, she needs to be happy with that.  For now, our 3 week old is perfect for us. :)|`|8fLVPhO7aa	You're not at all awful nor selfish.  Yes, many believe that giving an only child siblings is the "right" thing to do...but those are only opinions.  I know for myself...I had a terrible post labor and refused to have more children, yet now that my son is 15 months my views have totally changed-I can't wait to have more.  It's only been six months..things are still extremely rough, you might eventually want more.  If you don't, your son will be just fine!  You sound like a very loving and caring mother..don't let anyone tell you differently!|`|sRjURY43aa	I'm not lying to assure you labour is easy. Because it isn't. But it truly does get easier the more kids you have. I am the oldest of 3. My mom said I was the hardest (we have videos to prove it) my bro wasn't that hard, but was still hard, and my younger sis was REALLY easy. <br>  <br>  But that's just her...<br>  <br>  p.s congrats on ur baby!|`|ZSSUfSXwaa	It is hard to adjust to having a new baby and he's only 6 mos? Waaaaaaay to early to think about a sibling. There's nothing wrong of not wanting another one, and he'll grow up a happy and healthy boy if he doesnt. Still you need to enjoy him and think of the NOW, not about other children. Maybe when he's older and more self sufficient you can pose yourself the same question again... or it'll come naturally. <br>  I have two kids, but I always wanted more than one. But my sister after her first said no more, she has horrible pregnancies, sick all the time!! but now her daughter is almost 5 and she's now pregnant with number 2!!!!-she wanted a 2nd one- But that was after 4 years!! Her daughter is in kindergarten now so she's older and can actually help her a bit with the new baby. <br>  You need to do what you're ready for, relax, dont listen to anyone but yourself and enjoy your beautiful little guy.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I wouldn't really call it *pressure*, but everyone asks when we're going to have another.  Plus, pretty much everyone we are friends with are pregnant or just had a baby.  Three friends who have babies about the same age as our son (18 months) are pregnant and one just had a baby.  My husband's boss is going to have another baby soon (well, his wife), and another set of friends is trying to get pregnant with their second.<br>  <br>  I feel the same way you do about having another child.  I really don't want to go through labor and delivery again, nor do I really want to have to deal with night wakings, horrible poopy diapers, and all of the other not so fun stuff with newborns.  Right now is a horrible time for us to have another baby.  I'm working on finishing up my BA and when I'm done my hubby will go to school to get his BS.  Having another child now would make it really difficult for us to finish our schooling.  <br>  <br>  While I do want my son to grow up with siblings, I know he doesn't need them in order to develop to his fullest.  He is learning tons from the two boys that he is babysat with (a 2 year old and a 4 year old) as well as from his friends that are closer to his age.  I was an only child and my mom had to put some extra effort into making sure that I had plenty of social time with friends, but it worked out really well.  We "adopted" a lot of my friends into our family and they "adopted" me into their families as well.  <br>  <br>  No, you're not selfish.  Having children is a wonderful thing, but if you don't want more you just don't want more.  One thing that we are wanting to do is adopt the rest of our children.  After both of us finish our degrees we will be old enough and stable enough to be able to adopt, and that is something I feel really passionate about.  There are tons of kids who need and deserve a loving home that we can provide them.  Personally I have no qualms about adopting older children into our family rather than newborns.<br>  <br>  You do what you feel is best and follow those feelings.  It's taken me a lot longer than others to get "pregnancy amnesia".  I'm just now thinking that having another baby wouldn't be so horrible and am forgetting how difficult labor, delivery, and infant days were.  It's just now (after 18 months) that I'm even considering the possibility that I could handle that again.<br>  <br>  You'll be great and your son will be great no matter what you choose.
5rNwCItBaa	what are pelvic floor muscles? i think i used to have them lol<br>  <br>  Mine went back to "normal, if you can call it such a thing" around the time my daughter turned 2.<br>  <br>  But im now 27 weeks pregnant and i have to cross my legs when i sneeze lol<br>  <br>  Every woman is different|`|7XQwpBVaaa	I am just now back to "normal" and my daughter is 14 months old. |`|9eno55hCaa	That is different for everyone.  Some women take several months to go back to normal and some of us go back to normal fairly quickly.  I had a pevlic exam at 5 weeks to check some things and my doctor said she couldnt even tell I had a baby.  A friend of mine said she wasnt "normal" again till her daughters were 6 months old (she had twins) so it really depends on the women. (prolly the size of the baby and such as well...my daughter was premature so she was pretty tiny)|`|MfCkiJCVaa	Depends on the woman.<br>  Kegals!<br>  Kegals!<br>  Kegals!
9eno55hCaa	Babies can vomit if they have eaten too much.  I would just keep an eye on her and watch her closely.  If shes sleeping fine now and has no fever then it probably is just that she ate too much and her body needed to get rid of some of it.  If she doesnt seem to be better by the morning then I would call the doctor.|`|9gv1B73kaa	my baby does that EVERY time she eats! it just means what she's eating is too watery, if your breastmilking its harder, but some rice cereal mixed in the bottle shuld help.|`|LcdaUleUaa	Sounds like she rejected ALL of the milk.  I'm assuming you stored the milk safely in properly sterilized bottles...?   (your doctor will ask that too probably)  See if you can get her to take a bit of water, if nothing else, just to re-hydrate her.   If she brings that up too, then it's time to make an emergency call to your pediatrician.   <br>  <br>  If it stays down though, then she should be ok for the night and make an appointment for tomorrow.  (or at least talk to the doctor directly about it).<br>  <br>  Follow your instincts though.  If you still feel like something isn't right, then take her to emergency.  It's ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry.   |`|o1StMQeyaa	Firstly, don't overfeed your daughter again. If she has had a full breastfeed, that will be plenty.<br>  Secondly, babies vomit like that sometimes. When my daughter was younger, she had a couple of those major vomits. The first time it happened I was really concerned and rang nurse on call. I was told that it's nothing to worry about, even if it happens 2 feeds in a row. If it happens after 3 consecutive feeds or if it is happening every day, you should take her to see a doctor, but otherwise, don't worry.|`|AA11465739	I'd take her in to see a doctor. I can see spitting up mildly but throwing up that much can mean there may be something wrong. Better safe than sorry.|`|b4mdufODaa	Take her to the hospital or doctor.|`|sRjURY43aa	i'd go to the doctor!|`|50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	After you gave her the bottle, did you burp her well enough? I find that if my son has a burp trapped and then drinks his bottle, the formula sits on top of that air bubble. Then when his diaphragm relaxes and the burp makes its way up and out, all the formula comes up too. I would think, dont freak out just yet. If she vomits again at the next feeding and/or becomes listless, feverish, sickly...then freak out. But so far, Im sure she is fine. Maybe try get her on her side, even if you prop her up with a positioner or receiving blankets. She wont choke then or suffocate if she vomits in her sleep again. <br>  <br>  |`|7XQwpBVaaa	Calm down. If she is back asleep she is probably fine. The only thing I would worry about is her throwing up again and getting choked on her vomit because she is on her back. If you have one of those little side sleeping positioner things I would use it. It sounds to me like she got everything up but you never know.<br>  If she continues to vomit or isn't acting like herself tomorrow call her Dr.<br>  I personally wouldn't worry too much about it but trust your instincts if you feel like she needs medical attention tonight by all means take her. <br>  |`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Perhaps you should take her to the hospital?|`|BMfn0D9gaa	Do you feed her formula frequently? She may very well have a milk allergy. Vomiting is usually a sign of them rejecting the formula, she may be allergic to milk-based formula. 
50413e6060a85c241ba6435845a4cc2aaa	My 2.5 week old drinks 4 oz easy. I asked the doc about it and he said "Thats okay. Some kids just have bigger appetites. He is larger than life and he wants more to eat. Give him more". You wont over feed him. Im sure you will find that some feeds he only takes  3oz but others he will take 5oz. He will self regulate mostly and you just keep an eye on him. Hes a growing boy! Your ped isnt concerned so, feed him the 4-5 oz for now and try to mke that the routine. Maybe give 4oz every 3 hours instead of further apart.|`|7XQwpBVaaa	I would give him as much formula or breastmilk as he needs to be satisfied. Some babies need more than others and you can't always go buy what other babies his age need.  <br>  I do feel sorry for you, it sounds like you are going to spend a small fortune on formula this year!  Good luck and enjoy him! |`|I7Sd9qd6aa	feed him until he is satisfied, he will let you know when he is done. He is a growing boy, some babies take more than others, my daughter will barely take 4 oz at 3 months adjusted age, but some babies take 6 of 7. Feed him he's hungry! just make sure to give him some good burps in between.|`|ofs4ozHGaa	maybe he is just a big baby and a good eater which is good !!!<br>  as long as he's satisfied then its ok because if he gets too full he'll just spit out the bottle or whatever and stop eating and then probably fall asleep or something as long as he's mot hungry : >|`|b4mdufODaa	Give him 4 oz every 1 1/2 to 2 hours and see if that works.|`|sRjURY43aa	He's growing. Feed him|`|PlINAcLIaa	My son had 4oz at 6 days old! Don't worry!! You cannot overfeed a new baby, he will let you know when he's had enough.  |`|AA11465739	It's probably time for a growth spurt. Let him eat when he's hungry. Unless he's throwing up after eating then he isn't having too much. He's too young really to over eat. |`|U72PWNcKaa	if ur babies hungry feed your baby . its just a hungry baby|`|Wxvjdj2Taa	Feed it to him, a baby will eat as much as it needs|`|RzYePezkaa	It sounds about right because at this age they go through growth spurts very often which create a very hungry baby you should give him about 6 oz and let him drink it he will stop when he is full however it keeps up and doesnt stop after a week or two call your pediatrician.|`|KihffCc5aa	Follow your instincts.  Some babies that young will require huge feedings during growth spurts, after a week or so, you'll notice he'll be back to wanting only 4 oz.<br>  <br>  It sounds totally normal to me, I've been there with my babies.<br>  <br>  If he's fussing and crying, and sucks onto feeding to satisfy, let him eat what he wants.  You'll find that your newborn does go through growth spurts, and will consume massive amounts of bottle for a while, then be content to not have as much.  Your baby will let you know what he wants, it's ok.  I was shocked once when my newborn consumed a 6 oz. bottle (in 2 oz. increments), she was fine, she needed it.  She was on a feeding frezy for a week or so, then all of a sudden, didn't want as much... that is when I panicked!  Suddenly she wasn't eating all the ounces she had been!<br>  <br>  It's normal.  Your baby will let you know how much he needs and when, and it will fluctuate over the first year!<br>  <br>  Colleen|`|mVqvqoz5aa	Is it breastmilk or formula? I believe formula fills babies up faster so if you're using breastmilk maybe thats the reason. As long as your ped says its ok to give him that much then its ok. I pretty much just fed my daughter on demand when she was that young and she drank as much or as little as she wanted. Shes 3 now and not over or underweight.|`|9eno55hCaa	It could be hes going through a growth spurt or he just needs more food.  My daughter has days she wants 4-5 ounces at a time and sometimes she only wants 1-2 ounces|`|wtGP1VUTaa	feed him lol... theres not set amount his metabolism might be higher then most babies|`|9f781acdd2a8d587f475cd9992a7adeaaa	Feed him until he's full. He's not going to cry to be fed for nothing! He's a growing boy!
04c253b960f18a18e08c3f3a5950ba67aa	Okay what you pay in child support has nothing to do with the stuff she sends or does not send over. Yes you provide but that providing you do can be in a number of ways like the clothing and feeding and shelter (even rent, since he needs a roof over his head)  or daycare if applicable. Believe me kids cost lots of money and what you might provide may be a fraction of what is spent. <br>  It sounds like your separation or relationship has had some tension and been strained and that is why she acts this way. But since you share visitation then know that your son will have two homes from now until forever so you should have the necessities stocked regardless. Now if he's sick then you need to be informed ahead of time so that you can prepare,if its prescribed medicine she should send it over. If she doesn't then I would contact his pediatrician to make a note so that you are provided with a separate prescription if possible. <br>  <br>  Hopefully she will eventually loosen up and not be as particular.<br>  |`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	I will be the same with my sons father.....once he starts paying.  I nderstand where sh eis coming from.  I've spent thousands on this kid and he's spent like 90 dollars total.  PLus I don't want him losing or ruining stuff.  But he's  a douche bag, maybe your not.  |`|vdPP87Q8aa	that doesn't sound right to me. when your son's going with you, it's like he's going to the sitters, he'll need: diapers, wipes, formula, bottles, clothes, etc. it's almost like a packaged thing. when my son goes anywhere i make sure he has everything he needs whether that be another set of clothes or his blanket. whatever he needs, i send it with him. like the clothes for instance, she'll get them back. you just need them in case if something happens, then you need to change him. you can't just let him go naked everywhere. idk my son's 9 months old and i send him with EVERYTHING he needs that way i know he has it all and don't have to worry about that. hope this helps!<br>  good luck! :)|`|9eno55hCaa	hmm that does sound a bit weird.  Here all parents have a 50/50 custody (i live in denmark) so there isnt usually child support, but then both parents have to provide for the child when they ahve the child.  If your paying child support then she should at least send the things you need to take care of him for the time hes with you.  I mean oki diapers...you should really just get some of those kinds of things yourself.  But if its a perscription medication or clothes then she should really send that with him and you send them back.  (Though it would be nice for you son and perhaps for you as well if you had a bit of things for him at your house that was just for when hes with you a few outfits, some special toys or something.)  He may be 2 now, but if you start now as he gets older he will remember it and he will know he has a place with both his parents.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	I am not in that situation, but I would think that I would send my son with the things he may need, like I do now when I pack his diaper bag. It would be nice for you to have a back up pack of diapers, wipes, an outfit or two, a couple toys, etc. at your house just in case. But, I would think that she'd want to pack the essentials so she knows that he will have everything he needs.|`|o1StMQeyaa	That's weird! I would expect that you would supply nappies and food, etc, but she should send some clothes. And to not send his medication when he is sick is plain negligent. <br>  The two of you need to stop squabbling about who is paying for what and start putting your son's needs first.|`|774cd4b792f5a99de1d8c6c1f2a5860eaa	This is normal i understand your concern that you pay for the stuff but do you think the child support is suppose to be used to supply your house. If that were the case they would tell you to just buy the things he needs. The child support has nothing to do with this at all it has nothing to do with it. When you have your child you are suppose to have the things that your child needs. It should be there weather he is or not. You Ex should not have to supply you with every thing he needs that is your responsibility and the child support thing do you really think that what you pay every month will pay for all the things that your child needs? I am here to assure you that it does not it is very expensive to care for a child and you child support does help but if you add it up you got the long end of the stick. and i can not believe that you mentioned food do you really think she should provide his food when he is with you?

Work with a lactation consultant to improve your latch (bad latch causes both), and in the mean time lanolin will help a lot for the chapped skin.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Your nipples are getting used to being nursed.  Baby's saliva and the suckling can make them a bit irritated.  If you're not in pain, there's nothing you reallly need to do.  Your nipples will adjust. <br>  <br>  Or you can try using lasinoh between feedings, and exposing your nipples to the air for a little while.  Be sure you DON'T keep them rubbing against wet nursing pads all day. If you leak, change the pads often. (Or just walk around topless if you can do it.)|`|w1v9QMQtaa	I had similar things happen to my nipples when I started breastfeeding my son.  The other person on here mentioned the lotion/cream to put on your nipples (and that's what I did) and it works.  Also, the open air helped with healing, along with warm showers.  (The warm shower also helps your milk come down/release).  <br>  <br>  The only thing that I was especially careful about was to make sure that I had the lotion washed off well before feeding my son.  Good luck!  Stick with it and IMO you'll have a healthier, happier baby and the bond is incredible!|`|9eno55hCaa	I had this at first too while I was in the hospital with my daughter.  they gave me some gauze with warm water on it to put over the nipple and over that a small peice of plastic.  I would just change it everytime I pumped or she tried to eat.  It really helped and I didnt have to worry about any creams or medicines to fix it.  <br>  <br>  |`|fu0IHcuxaa	Yes it is normal, here is some cream you can use - <br>  <a href="http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?productId=2849143&cp=2582953.2582963.2582963&parentPage=family" rel="nofollow">http://www.toysrus.ca/product/index.jsp?...</a> |`|eSOVNowqaa	I would try and find some cream or lotion specifically for breast feeding. It sounds uncomfortable. Good luck.|`|CwN6n94raa	Your nipples are peeling from either damage (very common) or an infection.  Make sure your baby is latching on correctly.  If you have any concerns about this contact a lactation nurse.  You can also try lanolin cream.  You can find it at any pharmacy.  It will ease the damage done to your nipples and it is safe for your baby to ingest.  It is a thick clear gel with very little smell, color, or taste.  Also, make sure your breasts are not infected.  Do you experience a red to pinkish blotch on either breast?  This could be an infection and you will need to see the doctor.  Also, does your baby have thrush?  It will appear as a white to yellowish film in your baby's mouth along the cheeks and top of the mouth.  Thrush can be passed to your breasts and cause infection as well.  Wash your breasts with a warm cloth and soap after each feeding, but make sure you wash all of the soap off so the baby does not ingest any.  Good luck!!!  |`|Sd2FeA2Uaa	This is normal.  Your nipples are just adjusting to all the wear and tear.  It will get better by two weeks.  Mine actually got scabby and bled sometimes.  But it will get better soon don't worry. :)
iQjS2lJ4aa	Whenever you   feel ready, there really is no safe or best time.<br>  <br>  As long as baby is wrapped up well its fine.<br>  <br>  My midwife advised me to take my son out about a week old and it was so cold outside I was worried but I had to go, and he was lovely and toasty warm anyway!|`|faPKwClPaa	Whenever it's feasible.  I mean, you'd want to avoid freezing temps and sweltering heat, but for the most part, take him out and let him enjoy the fresh air and new sights.|`|Nti8czLvaa	Anytime is fine, just be sure to dress him for the weather!!|`|9eno55hCaa	Generally after a week is alright so I hear.  My daughter was premature and since 3 weeks old it was fine to have her outside (we were in the hospital for the first month though).  We live in denmark and (I dont do it but ppl do here) leave thier babies outside in sleeping strollers for naps during the day.  They start this from a very young age around 1 month old till they are 3 or 4 till they stop taking naps.  (I dont plan on doing this one personally but to each thier own)|`|avx7bLnKaa	you can start now.. just don't let strangers touch him... believe me they'll try....<br>  if around family or friends make sure they wash their hands or use hand santizer...|`|AA10615926	you can start now....it is an old wives tale that you need to keep baby inside.  |`|6auqS9pLaa	now - just don't let people touch him/her and try to keep the baby covered.
9eno55hCaa	I would not smack her directly against her skin no.  But what you can do that I have seen works well with very small children is put your hand over thiers (Not to firmly). Tell them "No" and smack the top of your own hand.  The noise is usually enough to get them to realize its bad without actually hitting them.  By taking thier hand your making sure that they realize your speaking to them directly.  A toddler is very easily distracted, as is a baby...a simple "no" does not always do the trick.|`|aLHNF9peaa	Personally, I wouldn't smack her hand, but that is your decision. You can definetly tell her No in a stern voice. Also remember to praise her when she does something good. For example, if she is getting into something that you don't want her to touch & you tell her NO & she stops, praise her for listening to you. Good luck. |`|eCJKbAbXaa	No it is not ok to smack a 7 month old! Are you insane?! She is a BABY. Just pick her up, say no and give her something of hers to play with. Jeez you'll smack a 7 month old, what are you going to do when she accidentally breaks something?|`|n4AnbFASaa	Everything you describe here is perfectly normal, it's Ok to smack her hand and say no no, but as far as outright disipline to early for a 7 month old!|`|q3i4oUhraa	She is too young to understand. She is just a baby, exploring is what they do. Wait a few mos.|`|KUnDQfBGaa	At least she might turn out to be an amazing electrical engineer,U never know!|`|L16wLAhNaa	Personally I think it's fine.  When you say smack her on the hand though, makes it sound like you're going to wack the kid hard.  Just lightly hit her hand and tell her no.<br>  <br>  My grandma tells me this story of me when I was a baby.  Instead of spanking me or hitting my hand she would clap.  When i'd go near something I wasn't supposed to touch, or when I got into things she would clap her hands real loud and say no.<br>  Years later when I was 3 or 4 my cousins took me to the circus.  Well, when everyone started clapping I got scared.  I thought I was doing something bad and got under my seat and started crying.<br>  <br>  So in a way I like the idea of clapping you hands together to tell the kid no, but at the same time only do it when they're small and explain the clapping thing to them when they're a little older.|`|TuPUCKZtaa	NO! Sorry but NO! She will not get why you are doing it but she may come to fear you. I do not believe in any physical discipline for any child but babies in particular do not grasp disciplines until they are closer to two- then it is a time out, then as they get older taking a privilege away. All you teach with physical discipline is that hitting is okay and fear (not respect). It is your choice to decide if you put things away but it will save you from constantly saying no and redirecting if you do. I have not done it for the whole house just the area she plays in so that she can safely explore and do her thing- she doesn't feel confined or restricted so she is able to do so much without constant boundaries.  Because the rest of the house isn't I am teaching her toys are play things- the house things aren't. Doesn't always work but she is young so its more of a search for independance not a misbehaving thing. I enjoy watching her explore and be independant without the worry she will hurt herself. Please don't smack your little ones hand, though they understand so much this will leave her confused and hurt.It leaves an impression on them that it is a big thing to get into things, sparks their independance, and creates a little bit of rebellion in them. I know it doesn't sound true but it is. By calmly redirecting, saying no, explaining the danger and moving on they forget what they what they were doing easily. But again smacking their hand just simply isn't the right method- it isn't a discipline its just placing fear in your child and in no way loving as a parent should approach things<br>  |`|OR5XSaBwaa	Right now, your child is at the age of "exploring". It's only natural for her to get into and around things. Saying "no" is appropriate but as far as hitting her hand, that's a bad idea, she wont understand why you hit her, but she will know that you hit her and it hurt. Not only will your problem be a child who gets into everything, but she will also have learned to hit. Instead, you should limit her area by rearranging a little bit of movable furniture, like tables and chairs. Hope this helps!|`|71c2edc6f88865044478ba7b4ce1d85caa	you can smack her on the hand, but seriously you should baby proof the house.  At this age they don't know consequences to there actions, so all they know is mommy smacked me.  Anyone who has a baby over to there place for a visit should understand this and understand its the parents responsibility to watch the child and make sure she doesn't get into things.  Good Luck!|`|lkvCJDIoaa	When my daughter was at the age and kept touching things I would put her back into her playpen after saying no a few times. She got the hint after a while. You should never smack your child because your doing it and your child will start smacking other children when she is in her toddlers years. Since you are doing it they think it's ok to do it. |`|44126a34b9fb10fc16ff09b0c6653ba6aa	sure it's ok, not hard though, she will learn what no means and then u wont have to worry about her getting your stuff. i will say that the attention span is short so be patient and stay strong with it, she will get it.|`|pNC24hxEaa	I think that maybe its too early to smack her hand just yet. But when she messes with something shes not supposed to  just point to it and tell her no and then distract her with something else.  My son was always into everything too.|`|HkRndSuqaa	Like you said, I think that is the only way they learn! My daughter is 6.5 months and starting to move around more, I plan on doing that with her! I haven't started swatting her on her hand but if she keeps touching things I say no and pull her arm back! She is very aware of what I'm saying! I know not everyone will agree with the way your or I are doing it, but everyone does things different and I think you have to do what is right for you and your family! |`|MDTgUDnUaa	Yes, you can begin to "train" a child up at 7 mos. We started with my son at that age... because YES they can begin to make a connection between action and consequence. If our son started to touch something that was off -limits, we would thump his hand gently and tell him in a nice voice "no touch". He'd make a funny face or cry at first, but within a week if we said "no touch", he realized it wasn't worth the little thump. He's 2 1/2 now and is still told "no touch" and he won't touch. Check out the book "To Train Up A Child". It's awesome!|`|MlHPTLkUaa	Hi, discipline is an ongoing thing, and should be more honestly called training.<br>  <br>  DEFINITELY - DO NOT strike a child especially one so young!<br>  <br>  Therefore to train them you only need to use your voice.<br>  <br>  Place things that are dangerous away from their inquisitive hands and then be watchful of the rest.<br>  <br>  If/When they are in a dangerous situation or doing something that they shouldn't then simply and "Ah Ah!" in the correct tome should warn then it is frowned upon, they will learn over time to associate the tone with disapproval and will avoid the thing in future.<br>  <br>  If they still take no heed of this then augment the "Ah Ah" with a picking them up and placing them in a different location, you could couple this with a 'cross' expression.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|yVtAu0Ueaa	Yes you'll doing the right thing but i heard smacking the hands makes them meaner try saying no right now in a firm voice then as she gets older try the leg. only reason i say that is because i think i spank a little to much and not it's doesn't even get to my son any more he's terrible 2!!! and it show i mean it may not be because of that but it's what i heard so im just passing it on just remember do no's right now save the spanking for serious things like touching plugs, fans,cores or being by the window good luck your on the right foot with keeping the things down so she can learn|`|pXSKSS3daa	No! Do you really think your 7 month old is going to understand WHY you're smacking her hand? She will only link that to Mommy being mean to her, is that what you want?<br>  <br>  Redirection is the key with smaller infants that cannot yet understand right from wrong. When she's getting into something you don't want her to be getting into then just direct her back to her toys. She will eventually get the hint of what is safe to play with and what is not.|`|zQWNb6neaa	I wouldn't smack her hand. Telling her 'no' or 'please don't' and redirecting her is enough to help her to learn not to do something at her age. |`|RwoN3E9Uaa	No you should not smack your 7 month old on the hand - they have no idea why you would be doing so.  In my opinion, you shouldn't do it for an older baby either.<br>  <br>  Just take them away from whatever they are not supposed to have and give them something that they can have.  Think positive, not negative when parenting your child.|`|k2heQRKFaa	I would say no to any physical discipline at that age so young so fragile. You dont realize what damage you could do. Ive heard recommedations not to strike any child under 2 because of the physical damage that could result. I would redirect her attention to something else a toy, etc. Keep her entertained sit down and play with her so she will be less likely to go for the cords.|`|LPEWAoWCaa	I have 3 kids and I think she is too young to smack her hand but you can definitely tell her "no" in a stern voice.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I wouldn't smack her hand I would just pull it away and firmly tell her no and that isn't hers to play with.
aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	There is not a lot you can do with younger infants, as a group, in the way of lesson plans.  <br>  <br>  With older children, there are learning activities that they can participate in, especially if there is a small ratio of children to adults.  <br>  <br>  At those stages, EVERYTHING is a learning experience-play classical music and/or nursery rhymes.  Take a walk around the block.<br>  <br>  Depending on the ages, here are some things that will teach lessons:<br>  <br>  Bubbles<br>  Balls<br>  Balloons<br>  Blocks<br>  Playing in the bathtub<br>  Playing in the sandbox<br>  Visiting the Duck Pond to feed the ducks<br>  <br>  Going for a stroll-the sights, sounds and smells will stimulate baby, even if s/he is in a stroller.<br>  <br>  BOOKS BOOKS BOOKS!  Especially board books or vinyl books that the child can play with him or her self.<br>  <br>  Tasting new foods.<br>  <br>  My youngest daughter just celebrated her first birthday, and these are some of the things she likes to do now and/or has liked over the past several months.  Here are some other ideas:<br>  <br>  Musical instruments-harmonica, or just playing with pots and pans.<br>  <br>  She loves her See & Say.<br>  <br>  And, in moderation, she loves to watch television.  If you have DirecTV, they have a channel called Baby First TV that offers educational programming for young ones.  They offer suggestions for learning opportunities for the little ones.  <br>  <br>  Gymboree has a Baby Book and a Toddler Book full of activities to do with little ones.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

5UB4Fnpeaa	This is very normal.  The baby has heard a heartbeat for 9 months and now it is suddenly silent.  They want to hear familiar sounds.  It is a fact that at this age babies can not be spoiled by holding.  Hold them, love them, enjoy the time, and eventually, they will become secure and sleep on their own.  Speak in a soothing voice, and eventually, you will be able to talk or sing to them to calm them rather than always picking them up.  Babies need comfort and security, offer it to them and enjoy it.|`|wiAVa1H5aa	Totally normal!   It's hard on new parents, but soooooo normal.|`|108cbf465aba14d306cf8d0e8081f6e3aa	This is very normal.

I think babys belong close to there moms.  I always ended up having a "family bed".  |`|Aq2W6snqaa	I am a mother and I know a lot of babies who are like that but trust me you don't want the baby to get use to it so what you do is put the baby in a bouncer or rocker and take one of your shirts because it has your scent and put it next to them.  Don't start something that will be hard to break in the coming years.|`|6kKjWXHGaa	Go get the book  SOLVE YOUR CHILD'S SLEEP PROBLEMS.<br>  It worked miracles for me!
UpYL5zPFaa	That sounds exactly like my daughter. She is an excellent sleeper at nights, usually 7 till 7, but she will only nap 30 minutes at a time, 4 times a day. I know 30 minutes isn't really long enough to do any tasks and to be honest I don't get much done during the day. I usually wait untill she goes to bed to do my household duties etc. When we're at home she sleeps in her cot during the day, but if I'm out I don't come home just to let her nap. If we're out she usually sleeps in her car seat.<br>  I think we just have baby's who don't like to sleep long during the day.<br>  <br>  Good Luck |`|UbM3d1cSaa	She should eat first so her tummy is full and she will be more content.  Rub her back and sing her lullabyes.  Make sure she has a blanket tucked in around her.  Also, really lightly touch/rub around her eyes and eyebrows.  That works every time for me!|`|VMASMHX6aa	First of all, I'd like to say she is sleeping through the night amazingly for her age. My son was about 9 months before he did what your little one is doing!<br>  <br>  As for daytime naps, she is past the age where she will sleep anywhere. If you are out and about you can't really expect her to sleep.<br>  I'm afraid that if you want her to sleep well at certain times of the day you are going to have to plan your day around her naps and let her sleep in her cot. If she is only sleeping for 30 minutes twice a day then that still leaves you plenty of time to get things done.<br>  <br>  When my son was that age he had a morning sleep about 2 hours after he got up. We would then go out for a few hours and he would have another sleep in the afternoon.<br>  Since he was 1 he's had one sleep a day, at lunchtime. We do morning and afternoon activities and we come home for lunch and sleep.<br>  <br>  I think she is too young to be getting through the day on one sleep. Most babies need 2 a day until they are around 1.|`|f1d964b42f3ef56bb45cb6d156c1faf5aa	Just to let you know my son used to have 2 3 hour naps during the day at that age and sleep right through the night, My daughter however only has a couple of naps during the day. 1 hour one at about 9.30am and another 2 hour one at about 1.30pm.  My point is all kids are so very different. I always put my daughter in her cot if we are at home though and let her sleep in her pushchair if we are out and about - she is happy whatever.  If I were you I would persevere with an afternoon nap but just don't get too hung up on it if she won't settle. Good Luck.|`|mVG3QLyEaa	Looks like little one is getting enough sleep and the amount of sleep duing the daytime decreases gradually as they get older( if you are lucky, if you are unlucky it is night time sleep that decreases!). All my children have just fitted in with whatever is going on in the afternoon and have slept when they like in pushchair, car or cot if we are at home. If you think about it, once you have a toddler and baby, baby just has to fit in as you have to do playgroup/swimming/jo jingles etc with the toddler. It sounds like you are doing a great job and have a happy little girl. You do not need to be stuck in the house all day, if you are like me, you are a better parent when you are out and about.....just go with it! |`|ILHXFZF6aa	It sounds like your daughter is a good sleeper. My daughter is nearly 16 weeks old and she goes down at 10pm and sleep through to about 5.30-6am and has a 6 ounce bottle.<br>  <br>  She then sleeps again at 7.30am for about half hour then wakes up then she usually just sleeps on and off all day for 10 mins here half our there. She's also started to find it harder to sleep when we go out. She used to nod of straight away but now she is starting to get interested in her surroundings so she likes to look at things around her pram, but she dos eventually go to sleep with the rhythm of the pram.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your daughter is doing everything she is supposed to. She is a little older than my daughter so its different but as she gets older she will go down for long naps less often. Just play with her when shes awake keep her stimulated because she might be falling asleep because shes bored.<br>  <br>  If she falls a sleep because she is genuinely knackered then she will more than likely sleep longer. You shouldn't have to be in the house for nap times. If she's tired she will sleep as I said at this age she will becoming aware of her surroundings and will sleep less in the pram as it's all very exciting compared to sitting in the house where she will get bored more easily and the fresh are is good for them.<br>  <br>  I would wait until she gets a bit older then ask the health visitor or doctor for advice if she is still not naping very well. But remember every baby is different there is no exact way they are supposed to behave.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.|`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter naps in the pram, so if I need to go anywhere I can just take her along.  It really is the only way I can get anything done and she loves it anyway. Shes 12 weeks

9eno55hCaa	You should let your newborn eat until shes done.  Not just a specific amount. (Unless they are feeding her through a tube like they were with my daughter.) They started her on 20ML every 2 hours and slowly built her up to 60ml every 3 hours...They said its because thier stomachs are extremely small when they are born especially when they are born early.<br>  <br>  Though it also depends on how premature she was.  My daughter was 7 weeks premature.  They started her with such a small amout of food.  We would weigh her daily and use her weight to determine how much food she should be getting.  As soon as possible I started pumping so she could get the benifit of breast milk as opposed to formula.  Shes 12 weeks old now at 9lbs and doing well.|`|bZWbwyn4aa	You didn't mention how premature your baby was, or what size, but my daughter was born at 2.2kg and even though she was full term, she was the same size as many premmies in the special care nursery.  I do remember that she never lost weight - with the little ones they started tube feeding them immediately.  Your baby should not be losing weight - they don't generally allow it to happen in the nursery.  Normal babies lose weight in the first few days because the mother's milk has not come in, but they can handle the weight loss.  Premmies and small babies cannot afford to lose weight because they generally have temperature control and blood sugar issues, so they need to be kept well fed in those first few days.<br>  <br>  With regard to the amount, I do remember that I was required to feed my daughter 44ml every 4 hours in the last few days in the hospital, and she left when she was 10 days old, so if your little one is getting 24ml every 2 hours, that is about the same quantity as my daughter was getting in a 4 hour period, but it depends on her birth weight. |`|11630f2e60bd7eb0961ab855f68bbcc0aa	All babies are different, but through studies they have found what works for most babies.  They decide how much to feed premature babies by balancing two things: the need for the baby to gain weight and the weakness of the baby's intestines and stomach.  If they feed too much, too quickly, it can hurt the baby's intestines.  If your baby needs more food than her stomach can handle, they'll feed her through an IV.<br>  <br>  What matters most in determining how much to feed your baby is how big she is.  The calculations for how much to feed a child start with how much she weighs, then they multiply that by a number to figure out how many calories she needs each day.  Like for adults, we need about 2000 calories per day, but someone who weighs 100 lbs needs less than someone who weighs 200 lbs.  Once they know how many calories your daughter needs, they look at whether she can get all that from what she's drinking (milk or formula).  If she needs more calories but isn't strong enough to drink more, they can add extra calories to her milk (by adding extra dry formula but not adding extra milk/water).<br>  <br>  As others have suggested, ask your daughter's pediatrician (or, if she's in the hospital, ask the neonatalogist) why they are limiting her to 24 ml every 2 hours.  Premature babies have different problems than full term babies, and you cannot follow the same rules you might follow for another child.|`|WT56iKwZaa	premature babies have unique needs. i would call your babies doctor and talk with them because of the prematurity. How much did she weigh at birth? It is natural for babies to loose a little weight after birth and should be back to their birth-weight by the 2 week checkup. But because your baby is premature and more fragile then a full-term baby I would call your babies pediatrician ASAP.|`|AA11022786	ALL babies lose weight but they should be gaining after about 2 weeks. Babies are in water for 9 months and will lose some of the water in their systems the first week. And my baby was not a preemie but she ate VERY little as well (but she was born at 4.8lbs) and started gaining weight after 7 days. She will tell you when she's hungry and she will also tell you when she's full. So long as she's not still sucking when the bottle is empty then she's fine...if she's still trying to suck when there's no more milk give her an extra 10ml at a time more...then make bigger bottles.|`|fhYVEpmUaa	If your baby will eat more than feed her more!  To hell with the midwife.  As long as you aren't forcing the baby to eat give her as much as she can keep down.<br>  <br>  Weight loss I can imagine is far more dangerous for a preemie. I know babies lose weight shortly after birth but don't let it go too far.|`|6XOLUsI0aa	You need to ask your baby's doctor. I personally don't think that it's enough. At her age and being premature I would give her about 60-90 ml/ 2-3 oz. every two hours. you will know if that's too much or not enough. 24ml/ 1/2 oz. is definitely not enough. She should really be at a hospital so they can check her out if she is premature and loosing weight, that not nothing to play around with. babies die everyday from prematurity.
1fbf02e1452cd78e340d80c11af19502aa	I am a big believer in breast so much I went on for 18 months with my first but this time around I have found a bottle of formula really helps my little one go to sleep at night.<br>  <br>  Even though I didn't have any breastfeeding Nazi's around me, I felt guilty giving her the bottle. It must be an innate guilt.<br>  <br>  I think its ridiculous if the information is not available particularly as bottle fed babies get gastro more from unsterilised bottles. I think it's important to give mothers a range of options. I think they are trying to avoid any more women regretting giving up breastfeeding. You'd be surprised how many woman I have met that have only one regret in life - not giving breastfeeding another chance.<br>  <br>  I think I have learned alot from YA and that is there are so many women that want a break from the guilt. They need other mums to give them a pat on the back for doing their best and that you have from me.|`|4UQ3Rzjgaa	I agree with you, i live in NZ and i fully breastfed for 5mnths until i couldnt make enough milk and switched to formula but i have had so many people that have told me i should have tried harder to keep breastfeeding (i did try hard but nothing worked) and that its not fair on the baby to start formula etc. Even at the hospital they make the mums with formula fed babies feel less important, My son was in hospital at 3mnths old for bronchiolitis and they will only provide meals for the breastfeeding mothers (luckily i was breastfeeding at the time) fair enough breastfeeding mums need to keep their energy up but dont formula mummys deserve to be fed as well? Thats just my opinion anyway sorry for going on about it lol|`|Kw2J0whGaa	I can't comment on NZ because I live in good ol Blighty but I can totally relate to this. Its totally unacceptable that information on alternatives is withheld and a disgrace that self righteous breast feeding mothers feel they have a right to comment. I for one would have loved dearly to breast feed but due to essential nipple surgery I was unable to. It broke my heart that this prevented me from breastfeeding my baby and my sadness would have been compounded by unhelpful comments from mothers who hadn't a clue about my circumstances. If the information on alternatives was unavailable to me the consequences could have been detrimental to my baby. Health professionals should make all information readily available and other people should mind their own business.|`|NkOHmPpmaa	I am very pro breastfeeding...i think calling us 'nazis' is a bit extreme.<br>  <br>  I don't have any issue with people using formula, i just hate the way it has become so 'normal'. Whether you want to accept it or not, babies are meant to be breastfed.<br>  <br>  Pro breastfeeders try to give advice, because so many people say the reason they gave up was because they couldn't do it right, so we try to give the facts andadvice to let you know how your experience could be better.<br>  <br>  Anyway, you think you've got it bad...what about all us breastfeeders who continue feeding past 6 or 12 months and people look at us like we've got 2 heads because we are feeding our children 'human milk' as opposed to something out of a tin or from another species.<br>  <br>  *waiting for all the thumbs down from the 'formula feeding nazi's'**|`|reO9Dgmsaa	I'm not in NZ, but America, and all I can say is that the overwhelming majority of breastfeeding "nazis" (as you call them) are simply trying to spread awareness and education, so more women CAN succeed at nursing.  There are the odd ones who simply call you a bad parent, which solves NOTHING.  <br>  I have to agree with wiXet about being looked at like a sideshow freak for allowing my daughter to self-wean (she is currently a happy 24 month old nursling)....sometimes it can be really upsetting!  :(<br>  Obviously I wasn't there when you nursed your first child, but pain that severe suggests a latching problem.  When my daughter latched wrong once, I jumped several feet from the pain!!  So with this next child, keep that in mind, give nursing a try, and ask for help if you need it, okay?  :)<br>  <br>  Edit:  "What I have a problem with is that if, after giving it your best shot, breastfeeding is creating a negative bonding situation or a very unhappy mummy- that women are told to keep persisting through - and that there is no support or information about the alternatives."<br>  <br>  I do agree with you on this... but so many times I hear something like "I nursed for 3 days and it was just too much."  That cannot be called giving it your best shot!!  So I'm torn.  I don't want mommies to be unhappy!!  But I also want babies to get breast milk, since it's so darn wonderful!  That is why I am telling everyone I know about nursing, and how important it is to be educated about common problems that can arise.  :)|`|9eno55hCaa	I live in Denmark.  Usually that wouldnt be so important, except that women here think nothing of pulling thier breasts out to feed thier baby where ever and whenever, most dont even bother to cover up (not that I mind, just how things are here).<br>  <br>  Ive tried breastfeeding my daughter for weeks....she was premature so the first month it wasnt even possible to attempt, she was much to small....So ive been pumping and pumping and pumping and giving it to her in bottles...I get the weirdest looks when we are in public.  Even my mother-in-law seems a bit annoyed by the idea we give her a bottle.<br>  <br>  In the hospital they had never once suggested to me about giving her a bottle.  They didnt tell me anything about formula or what to do with it or how much to give her or anything....So Ill just keep pumping and pumping in the hope that she will eventually latch on (Shes 12 weeks now).
9eno55hCaa	If you only let your baby suck for 2-3 minutes thats not long enough.  Sometimes in the begining milk stops and starts or so Im told (I have to pump my daughter wont even attempt to latch on).  First thing you can do to increase your milk, stop giving her formula.  Take a few days and feed her on demand, keep her close to you bare skin to skin contact.  Sleep with her and if you can, take a warm bath with her.  (The skin to skin contact helps me to keep my supply up since my daughter wont nurse at all on her own).  The other thing is dont think about how much you have.  <br>  <br>  The more you think about it, the more you will stress, the less milk you will have.|`|baI5G8yLaa	Are you eating enough? milk burns 500 Cal's a day so you need plenty of energy! lots of water and rest too and dont diet, they are the main factors<br>  <br>  The thing is breast milk is a supply on demand so the more often you feed the more milk you should get so try and try to feed her as often as you can then if she still refuses to feed try pumping after wards to stimulate you boobs Even if you don't get anything out keep pumping for 2 Min's on each breast hopefully that shoud work,<br>  If not i have heard that you can get some herbal tea to help you produce more<br>  <br>  keep up with it your doing a good thing even if she isnt getting a lot from you, some is better than nothing|`|zTcHSR7baa	***Good on you for breast feeding** <br>  Remember: supply equals demand. If you wont to make more milk your baby must be able to feed often and well.<br>  -make sure baby is correctly attached. to maintain a good supply mums must feed at least 8 and as often as 12 in 24 hours. Expressing after feeds, will maximise breast stimulation and emptying.<br>  -try stroking the breast towards the nipple on all sides when feeding, but try not to dislodge baby from nipple.<br>  -If your baby gets sleepy or dozes off when you feed change sides to wake her up. you may need to change often<br>  -offer little snack feeds when your baby is awake.<br>  -offer breast as a comforter for a few days instead of a dummy.<br>  -If your baby is hungrier and wont's to feed more often do so that will make more milk supple.<br>  -Eat well and rest as much as you can.<br>  -And stop giving formula that will make you supple very low.<br>  ***maybe get some help for your health nurse or a breast feeding counseior to make sure your baby is attached ok.<br>  Good luck with it all|`|OqbwXWJEaa	There are many reasons that you may not be producing enough milk.

Ask him who he thinks you're supposed to be having sex with?  The fact that he's not communicating with you about his feelings on sex isn't fair to you.  I know my husband is dealing with some psychological issues on sex with me after watching me give birth to his daughter.  Men are more sexually sensitive than we think (which I am just learning myself).  But my husband is at least trying sex and letting me know how he's feeling about it.  Knowing that he's having issues is a little unsettling to me, but at least I know what is going on.  Not having sex since last August is CRAZY!!  You almost have to stop and ask yourself if he is having sex elsewhere already himself.  I don't mean to throw that into the mix, but seriously, ask him.  I don't think a man would go that long without even trying.  Sounds fishy to me.<br>  <br>  My husband is struggling with being a new father.  He kind of got the "baby blues" after I gave birth and things haven't been the same since.  I didn't get any post partum depression, but he sure did.  He is also freaked out about me getting pregnant again, so that adds to his sexual reluctance.  Your man may be going through something similar too.|`|9eno55hCaa	Boy do I feel your pain.

QzNd1n6Xaa	Yes, it's necessary to give your baby tummy time, this is where they develop strong neck muscles.  If you've ever heard of a baby having to have visits to the chiropractor, it's often because they didn't have enough tummy time.  Like you said though, it's important to be supervising the child at all times, due to SIDS risks.  There are also many ways for your baby to spend time on their tummy, such as lying in your lap, lying in a crib, lying on blanket on the floor, etc.  As long as you are paying close attention, tummy time is appropriate, and necessary for a baby to strengthen muscles and explore the world!|`|pXSKSS3daa	Absolutely, that is what people call "Tummy time". Just make sure if your infant cannot roll over then you are always keeping an eye on them.|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	Yes, it is ok if they are awake.|`|9eno55hCaa	Depends on the baby.  Its fine if your in the room with them and plan on staying there.  I did with my daughter occationally, and do now daily when she has tummy time 3 times a day. <br>  <br>  If they can roll over on thier own its safe to let them sleep on thier tummy though. Because its kinda silly to turn them over only for them to put themselves back on thier tummy.|`|CzKrqgmgaa	of course. its called tummy time. if u have a newborn this is best done on your chest but once your baby is a little older if he/she will let you go for it!|`|OKarH9Zsaa	Yes that would be fine, most babies learn to crawl laying on their tummy's.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	yes, as long as they arent sleeping|`|n2bQiWwhaa	yes it is ok to lay your baby on his belly, as long as they aren't sleeping. The motto is Stomach to play, Back to sleep.

We co-sleep with our daughter some of the night and put her in her crib for part of it.  <br>  <br>  Naps, we wait till shes almost asleep before we put her in the crib. She does not usually cry, but when she does we pick her up and try again.

Labor or motherhood?<br>  If its labor, for me I didn't even realize I was in labor. After 9 months of sickness, discomfort, bodily changes etc, I just thought it was a perk of being hugely pregnant to be in discomfort. I didn't think my son would be 3 weeks early, and the contractions were just tight and uncomfortable and made it hard to breathe. <br>  Motherhood is a scary thing to think about, but when it happens you will know what to do. Something just clicks and you do what works for you. Listen to other peoples advice, even if some of it will annoy you. If you tune everyone out, you may miss the most important thing anyone could ever tell you. For me, I was sick of being told "Oh how young are you? It must be so hard, you should hire a nanny to help you out, or find a nice guy to marry." But I did get one piece of advice that will stick with me, and that was "Take a deep breath and believe you are a perfect mom, because with confidence you will think even the scariest task is achievable." |`|sycgY17taa	*If anyone can/is willing to stay with you PLEASE let them.<br>  *yeah sleep when the baby sleeps (I found it hard to do because I still kept up my house, cooked for myself, bathed, wash bottles, scheduled dr appts, etc)  Sometimes you have to ignore the house work.  <br>  <br>  Try not to be scared all they do is eat, sleep and poop. |`|88c1bf4a8465d08773db86d35cc5b4c2aa	1. Enjoy your time with your spouse before your baby arrives because once he or she does you'll have very limited time together anymore. Your life will revolve around the needs of your baby. My daughter is 3 weeks old and I am staying at home with my daughter right now and my husband works 7:30 am. - 4:30 p.m. M-F. After dinner every night I have to lay down and nap so I'll be able to get up with our daughter at night, which shes' up a lot! <br>  <br>  2. Don't be afraid of bodily fluids! You will be peed on, pooped on, and puked on a lot! Don't worry it washes right off! ;-) <br>  <br>  3. Really do, sleep when your baby sleeps. My daughter is up every 2 to 3 hours to feed 24 hours a day, and sometimes she's up for several hours at a time now that she's 3 weeks old and getting more active. Sometimes these hours are in the middle of the night and you'll get very tired if you haven't napped when your baby naps!<br>  <br>  4. When you feel like you need a break don't be afraid to ask for help from your spouse or family. My husband and I both have had times in the last 3 weeks when we have been so stressed out because our baby won't stop crying or has been up all night or we just feel like we are ready to pull our hair out! It's important to not get all stressed out and ask for help when you need it! My mom has been great for this and so has our other family. Sometimes we all need a break even if it's just for an hour or two!<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|VTB5QpyBaa	Rest and enjoy as much as you can now. When baby comes sleep when the baby sleeps. Do not worry about the dishes or other household work all of that can wait. If anyone is offering to come and help with the baby, take advantage, you will be very thankful for that. |`|CnKLwyXmaa	There is nothing to be scared about. just enjoy ur baby's movement and talk to her a lot.

spwARELEaa	I would say try to  keep him in his crib.  I know it's easiest to feed him then put him back to sleep but that's not going to fix your problem.  Keep him in his crib and rub his back or belly (like pp said).  If I gently shook my baby in her crib by putting my hand on her belly she would fall back to sleep.  I was trying to mimic the feeling of a car ride.  Maybe play some music from him or give him a toy and see if he plays then falls back to sleep on his own.  Maybe give him a bottle of water.  |`|GzbkU9uWaa	I have in 8 month old to and she was on a great sleeping pattern tell a few months ago she sleeps about one hour during the day and wakes up at 12, 3 and five what i have to do to get a little sleep is pump and make 3 bottles and have them ready before bed. that way when she gets up i feed her before she gets a chance to really wake up and within 5-10 mins shes asleep and so im i|`|T7KKdIU0aa	My baby is 10 months old and was waking frequently too.  He is also breastfed and I was feeding him to sleep every time he wakes.  This was causing him to wake MORE though because he was gulping a lot of milk quickly, causing him gas.  It was a vicious cycle for mommy!  LOL!  I actually think that he actually NEEDS the nourishment of eating in the middle of the night because even though he eats all day long, he is an active little boy and he wakes because he is hungry.  They are growing SOOOO much and so quickly this first year and that takes a lot of calories!  <br>  <br>  We are working on it, but this has helped---we started giving him plain, toasted, multigrain waffles and a cup of formula mixed with liquid baby yogurt before bed.  That evening meal helps him go 4 or 5 hours before waking up!  YAY!  |`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Is he crying in his sleep or is he actually waking up??

How much they eat during the day has little to do with sleeping at night, in fact your baby may be waking to nurse more at night because he is eating too many solids during the day and has to get all his breastmilk at night -which is what he really needs to survive.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepthrough.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kathydettwyler.org/detsleepth...</a><br>  The expected pattern is for mother and child to sleep together, and for child to be able to nurse whenever they want during the night. Normal, healthy, breastfed and co-sleeping children do not sleep "through the night" (say 7-9 hours at a stretch) until they are 3-4 years old, and no longer need night nursing. I repeat -- this is NORMAL and HEALTHY. Dr. James McKenna's research on co-sleeping clearly shows the dangers of solitary sleeping in young infants, who slip into abnormal patterns of very deep sleep from which it is very difficult for them to rouse themselves when they experience an episode of apnea (stop breathing). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp" rel="nofollow">http://askdrsears.com/html/7/T070200.asp</a><br>  Nightwaking has developmental benefits. Sleep researchers believe that babies sleep "smarter" than adults do. They theorize that light sleep helps the brain develop because the brain doesn't rest during REM sleep. In fact, blood flow to the brain nearly doubles during REM sleep. (This increased blood flow is particularly evident in the area of the brain that automatically controls breathing.) During REM sleep the body increases its manufacture of certain nerve proteins, the building blocks of the brain. Learning is also thought to occur during the active stage of sleep. The brain may use this time to process information acquired while awake, storing what is beneficial to the individual and discarding what is not. Some sleep researchers believe that REM sleeps acts to auto-stimulate the developing brain, providing beneficial imagery that promotes mental development. During the light sleep stage, the higher centers of the brain keep operating, yet during deep sleep these higher brain centers shut off and the baby functions on her lower brain centers. It is possible that during this stage of rapid brain growth (babies' brains grow to nearly seventy percent of adult volume during the first two years) the brain needs to continue functioning during sleep in order to develop. It is interesting to note that premature babies spend even more of their sleep time (approximately 90 percent) in REM sleep, perhaps to accelerate their brain growth. As you can see, the period of life when humans sleep the most and the brain is developing the most rapidly is also the time when they have the most active sleep. One day as I was explaining the theory that light sleep helps babies' brains develop, a tired mother of a wakeful infant chuckled and said, "If that's true, my baby's going to be very smart."<br>  <br>  7. As they grow, babies achieve sleep maturity. "Okay," you say, "I understand this developmental design, but when will my baby sleep through the night?" The age at which babies settle – meaning they go to sleep easily and stay asleep varies widely among babies. Some babies go to sleep easily, but don't stay asleep. Others go to sleep with difficulty but will stay asleep. Other exhausting babies neither want to go to sleep nor stay asleep. <br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  An important fact for you to remember is that your baby's sleep habits are more a reflection of your baby's temperament rather than your style of nighttime parenting. And keep in mind that other parents usually exaggerate how long their baby sleeps, as if this were a badge of good parenting, which it isn't. It's not your fault baby wakes up.<br>  <br>  8. Babies still wake up. When babies mature into these adult-like sleep patterns varies among babies. Yet, even though babies achieve this sleep maturity some time during the last half of the first year, many still wake up. The reason? Painful stimuli, such as colds and teething pain, become more frequent. Major developmental milestones, such as sitting, crawling, and walking, drive babies to "practice" their new developmental skills in their sleep. Then between one and two years of age, when baby begins to sleep through the above-mentioned wake-up stimuli, other causes of nightwaking occur, such as separation anxiety and nightmares.<br>  <br>  Even though you understand why babies are prone to nightwaking, you realize it's still important for parents and babies to get a restful night's sleep, otherwise, baby, the parents, and their relationship won't thrive. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0071381392.php?nid=386&isbn=0071381392" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantley.com/elizabeth/books/0...</a><br>  My research began in earnest.

35BVWK37aa	Keep nursing as much as you can and NO MORE FORMULA, it may take about 3-4 days and if he's in pain before that glycerin suppositories are the safest for an infant.  The iron in formula is hard for babies to digest, heck the iron in vitamins are hard for adults so of course the formula kind are hard on them.  BM is known for looser bowels, but because there is less waste they go less, so when he does go it'll be easier.  BF babies can go almost 2 weeks without a messy diaper btw and be normal.  Formula is synthetic so none of the ingredients are digested as well and are absorbed badly so much of it is a waste product.<br>  <br>  OH AND NO KARO SYRUP, IT CAN CAUSE BOTULISM AND KILL BABIES!!!!!<br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/karo-syrup-for-constipation/AN01826" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/karo-sy...</a>|`|mo7QD3dKaa	I know giving orange juice to an older babie works, but this baby is really young for this juice maybe if your just try alittle or massage the babies stomach downwards softly with baby oil|`|qG1j1Y1Naa	Put a small amount of karo syrup in the bottle and just lesson the amount as he gets used to the formula.|`|IWinNj2saa	Try either Karo syrup 1 teaspoon in a bottle a day...make sure it's the dark, or prune juice.

Good Luck|`|9eno55hCaa	My daughter did this when she was in the hospital.  Give him a day or two (unless its been that long) breastfed babies can go up to 15 days without a bowl movement.  Formula fed babies should go at least every day but for some every other day is alright.  After 4 days the hospital gave her a bit of water (about ? oz) to help and it worked.  shes now 13 weeks and Ive been told if she gets constipated again its alright to give her a bit of water mixxed with a tiny bit of juice (like ? oz to ? oz only)  It seemed to help the last time too when she was 10 weeks. (she would not take just the water)<br>  <br>  If its been more than a few days though I would talk to your doctor before actually doing anything.|`|auNUWQo7aa	Any change in diet can cause change/adjustments in the bowels. Like another answerer said, give his body a little bit of time to become adjusted to the change. It is not life threatening for an infant to go three days w/out pooping if they are on formula and breastfed babies could go up to 7 days w/ out pooping.<br>  <br>  If, after you have given his body time to adjust and the problem persists, talk to your pediatrician about different options to relieve constipation, such as warm water, Karo syrup, rectal stimulation.<br>  <br>  Remember that constipation is only when your baby has gone more than 3 days without pooping, and or/ your baby is pooping small pellet like balls. If neither of these are occurring, then interference will be detrimental to your babies natural digestive tract learning to process accurately. For babies this small, their muscles are still developing, and the more practice they have, the stronger their bowels will become.<br>  <br>  Edit - To those who have not been updated: Botulism in Karo no longer exists. The rumors are still so widely spread that people do not realize it is safe and widely recommended by pediatricians. Karo is %100 safe and will not kill babies.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.com/21_1953.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.com/21_1953.html</a>|`|7XuzRloXaa	I know this sounds kinda gross.

Personally I would give her the name you want.  My sons father did the same thing.  He asked what I wa sgoing to name him adn then rolled his eyes and suggested other names.  Low and behold, my osn is almost 4 months and his father has yet to even see him and hasn't even called since he was a week old.  Needless to say, I named teh baby what I wanted.  I would be pissed too.  He's an irresponsible jerk adn I wouldn't give him the time of day.|`|shVlyBIkaa	His name sounds way stripperish! I think you're right to give her your last name. If he walked out once, he can walk out again.|`|9eno55hCaa	He may have walked out, but he came back...the fact that he came back is what matters.  My husband had an emotional affair over the computer and though he did not leave physically he chekced out on me entirely Emotionally and mentally we didnt even speak to eachother the entire time I was pregnant.  He "came to his senses" when i went into labor at 33 weeks.<br>  <br>  I had a name all picked out.  Apparently so did he...odly enough he wanted to use Natalia or Natasha....and I wanted Ember Lynn.  We decided that it was best to find a new name that we both liked and forget about what we liked individually.  So our now 13 week old daughter is Mianna Marie with his last name of course (I dont have his last name lol).<br>  <br>  Your not wrong with what your feeling, feelings are never wrong...but you are also pregnant and that can make those feelings 10xs worse.

You are not being hormonal - you are being completely rational. I say this as a father of 5 kids.<br>  <br>  You are right, the father sounds very immature. But it does sound like he is trying, so maybe you should give him a chance. But you should do it on your terms until you can figure him out and know that he is sincere. It is very important for a kid to have a father, especially a daughter. But if he is a jerk, nothing is worth that.<br>  <br>  Diamond is a stripper name by the way.|`|vRQaON5Uaa	you have every right to want to name your daughter by your the 1st name you want and your last name. im kind of in the same situation as you, just the father of my unborn child is in jail at the moment. he wants me to name him after him. but that my dear is not going to happen. If i've learnt anything from guys like that. Your gut is usually right, its easy for them to pick up and walk out whenever things dont go their way. but really i think of it this way. if its going to happen because of small stupid things, then might as well happen when the child doesn't get attached to someone they think will be there for the rest of their lives.. <br>  <br>  i dont know if that sounded harsh or anything. im just speaking from present experiences. <br>  <br>  Hope all turns out for the best<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALSO Agree with the above for legal issues.

I like Natalia better.|`|DL0luwfHaa	First off Natalia is a beautiful name.  I wouldn't fully decide until the end of your pregnancy for the last name.  I think that it should be your last name and if you ever get married then you can change it, but it will be a whole lot easier with her name being your last name.  Give him a little time to change, everyone deserves a second chance.  The child that your carrying is yours and you made it so its your choice and not his.  He should respect your choice of name if he truly loves that baby and you.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congratulations! |`|y2wnSprxaa	I say that you come up with something that you both like. Yes he did leave, but he came back and wants to be in his daughters life. He must feel about Natalia how you feel about Diamond. He hopefully will be around for the rest of her life and maybe taking an interest in her name is a subtle way of showing you that. Relationships are all about compromise ,and even though Natalia is a beautiful name you would really show how dedicated you are to having him in your daughters life if you took the time to work things like that out as a team. However I would give her your last name. Tell him when you get his last name, she does too, because if he sticks around, and marries you, you can always have her last name changed. The last name is a lot more serious because I think giving her his last name gives him certain rights that he might not be worthy of having, until he stands the test of time.<br>  P.S. <br>  Please don't name her Diamond!

4JuwXJrEaa	You're not supposed to add extra water to formula.  It throws off the balance.  What did the doctor recommend that you do for her?  It doesn't make sense that he would tell you that there is something wrong and not recommend something. |`|kzt8Kdkfaa	It doesn't sound like a good idea.  How old is your baby and what is her height and weight?  My son was always in the 95% or above for weight until he was 6 months old and my doctor was never concered.  He assured me that it is totally normal for them to be "butterballs" until the become more active and mobile.  The first few months he was gaining 3-4 lbs. each month, but that really slowed down.  He is now 12 months old, eats when he wants to, healthy, and not even close to being "overweight".  I'd get a new doctor!|`|0qP8gLpyaa	Your doctor sounds like an idiot.  It isn't safe for a BABY to be on a diet or have their formula watered down!<br>  They need the calories from the formula and watering it down won't give her the nutrients she needs.  Your doctor may not notice, but most babies are a little on the chubby side. It's called BABY FAT for a reason!  Once she goes mobile and especially walking kids slim down a little and hit a growth spurt.<br>  I'd go to a different doctor because this one sounds like some bad advice....<br>  |`|3MelQFxOaa	Ok-yes this is hard-how old is your daughter? My daughter is over weight but adding an oz more of water isnt going to help-you need to relax-once your child starts moving more-crawling if not already-walking and what not-they will start losing that baby fat. Also when babies reach 6 months old they slow down growing...maybe your baby was going through a growth spurt? My opinion I wouldnt "water down" the formula just because the doctor said your baby was over weight. Just wait it could all even out soon-4ozs isnt a lot my daughter is almost 5 months old and can drink sometimes 8ozs it is crazy! Just relax-I had an eating disorder too, its hard-try doing things like if your baby is hungry try a pacifier...I am a firm believer in if the baby is hungry feed them-you cant over feed a baby, i heard that sometimes more water can cause more gas also...its up to you.|`|vue9NOhYaa	You do not water down formula. And it wouldn't help anyway.  Water contains no calories, so baby would just get hungry sooner. <br>  <br>  It's VERY improbable that your baby is 'too fat' or gaining 'too much.'

So depending upon the age of this child, I would first question the diagnosis of being overweight (what is her age in months, height, and weight... we can look at a growth chart and see how those numbers compare).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if she is truly overweight, then you just need to reduce the daily calorie intake.  In other words, feed her the exact same quality of food she is getting now, just limit her quanity.  If she is young enough that she is exclusively formula feed, the general amount of formula a baby takes in per day should be about 3oz of formula for every pound of body weight.  If she is feed other solids, try to determine what is an equal amount of formula for the solid (look at the calories) to determine how much less formula to equal the solids.|`|lGrcLQ49aa	Don't water down formula - Unless your baby is SERIOUSLY overweight you should do nothing.

hzgFAJv0aa	Dear RPMR,<br>  <br>  I've been seeing several cases like this in the news lately. This kind of thing is absolutely disgusting and it IS human trafficking. These poor kids and their families - this is a tragedy on every level.<br>  <br>  PAPs NEED to make every effort to be educated and to be sure that the child they are adopting is truly adoptable. Agencies and facilitators should be held criminally liable for MORE than just "fraud" and penalties for cases like these should be SEVERE.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, the facilitators of these adoptions should no only rot in jail but should also have their assets seized and used to fund co-parenting programs for the victims. The families and children should be entitled to free legal assistance, free therapy, free travel expenses and damage awards for the children placed in trusts. BOTH families should be encouraged to be involved in the child's life with co-parenting agreements and visitation orders handled and enforceable through the family court system. When the child is old enough, they should be given the opportunity to have a say in how their case should be handled.<br>  <br>  This is a prime example of how the greed of some has ruined the lives of many and it is an abhorrent miscarriage of the service adoption is supposed to be.|`|Q0xm1Kodaa	I think you should let the child decide.

It isnt far to make her live with someone she doesnt want to.|`|1uCZFaR2aa	I'm not sure what exactly should be done.  <br>  <br>  But, what kind of person just "gives" their child away to strangers with candy?  By that I mean...  if it sounds too good to be true it usually is.  <br>  <br>  Why would parents think that they'd get free education for their child if they just gave them away for a while?   <br>  <br>  Has anyone ever stopped to think that maybe...  just maybe... those children deserve parents who will actually TAKE CARE of them and not hand them over to strangers?  <br>  <br>  I know there are people who steeal or kidnap children for various reasons...  but for a parent to hand their child over...  come on.  Really.<br>  <br>  On a different but narrowly related issue...  what should be done for parents whose child was switched at birth?|`|iVcaB9h7aa	There's no doubt what the right thing is.  These children were kidnapped and should be reunited with their families.<br>  <br>  How can the guilty be slapped on the wrist with five years probation when they have messed up the lives of so many people, including innocent children?  A better punishment would be requiring them to spend their own money to bring the children back to Samoa, taking whatever is dished out by the natural families, apologizing in the Samoan media and then standing trial in Samoa for kidnapping.<br>  <br>  Perhaps that might slow down any other deviants who think treating people this way is a good idea!|`|in6Iw3BEaa	The sad thing is that everyone is a victim.  Both sets of parents were lied to.  I think the children should be returned with their parents and hopefully they will be able to keep in touch with the adoptive families.  Those who participated in the scam should serve prison time, regardless of their own families. You'd think as parents, this kind of thing would appall them.  Funny, I never thought of Samoa as an adoption hot spot before.  I'm guessing the part of Samoa that these kids are from were not within the US territory.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	We ALL watched this story this morning on Good Morning America including our 11 yr old daughter who was adopted at the age of 5. <br>  <br>  HORRIFYING to say the least!<br>  <br>  We all agree that these children should be returned to their families and that this kind of thing should NEVER happen. As sad as this is these children were Not without loving families.<br>  <br>  This is one reason, I just could not bring myself to consider International Adoption--there is way too much money involved and the adoptive parents have little or no ability to be 100% sure the child is being adopted without illegal activity. <br>  <br>  When there is 20-30-60 thousand dollars involved there is far too great a risk that illegal activity is taking place in My Humble Opinion.|`|y6Fnx4zWaa	Well.. i am adopted and i think this is unbelieveable. the only way to really have safe adoptions is to go through the U.S.|`|ftSsVFQNaa	That is horrible. There is no good answer here.|`|eKtEWrcmaa	Its a very sad situation but for some returning to their biological families may be worse than staying where they are. In the article it said that some of the kids were placed as far back as 2002. Thats 7 years they have been with their adoptive families and in most cases probably longer than they were with their biological families. If its all about the children being ripped from the only people you can remember and the only culture you remember and bring sent back would probably be a horrible horrible experience. I do think that the families on both sides should get to stay in the children's lives in some way, shape or form though.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	"It is sad that stories like this contribute to the negative image some have about international adoptions!"<br>  <br>  <br>  Its not just a negative image......Its Reality.    <br>  <br>  Aps and the rest of society that doesn't care.......need to wake up.<br>  <br>  At least this guy did the right thing.....returned the child and became a sponsor which was only needed from the get go.  Too many foreign natural parents are duped into thinking their children are going away for an education and will be returned.  Many agencies in Guatemala used that tactic.  <br>  <br>  Its nothing new....just ignored.
2f6diQBiaa	That would be very unusual. It could be two things: 1) are you sure that the positive is really a positive? Sometimes it's hard to tell. The test line needs to be as dark or darker than the control line. 2) If you are sure it's a positive, I would babydance just in case you are ovulating this early. However, continue to take the tests. If you notice that you continue to get positives, you may have too much LH in your system (which potentially explains your long cycles). Multiple positives are often a sign of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).<br>  <br>  Good luck and lots of baby dust!!!|`|865lNOEDaa	are you sure its positive? The line  has to be as dark or darker than the control line hunny xxxx|`|QVsbhAeSaa	Thats very early but everyone is different i ovulate cd12 of a 35dc. U can go to the doc for a hormone level test. goodluck x
IFDfpbFJaa	Babies don't fix things. If the arguing just started since you've been pregnant it might just be that he's freaked out but too afraid to say anything. Have a talk with him and try to get to the bottom of all the fighting.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WlU3NFu6aa	Honestly, when baby is first here, it will get worse. you will still be hormonal. you will both be EXHAUSTED! and will take it out on each other without knowing it. <br>  It may get better as your baby gets older, it may not. but from personal experience, it will get worse in the beginning|`|AXEqOEloaa	I think every situation is different so really only time will tell. He needs to be a little more sympathetic during this time. Having a child is stressful whether it be the first or the fifth, but this is not the time to be stressing yourself or that baby. I hope everything works out for you.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	Once the baby comes, I can almost guarantee things will get worse because of the added stress of a newborn and the possibility for post-partum depression. Whatever issues you're having, you two need to work through them *now*, before the big day.|`|vigFmfLmaa	I would say it will get 10 times worse if you don't fix the problem.  Babies bring sleepless nights, tons of worries, financial and free time restraints...|`|J3REXSldaa	ummm no|`|8Raw4M1naa	You also have to remember your hormones are going crazy, and it makes you a little more... cranky sometimes. It may not be that you are arguing a lot more, but that you notice it more now that your hormones are off the charts. That also may have something to do with his grumpy mood as well. He may not fully understand that your hormones make you had mood swings, and it unrealistically demanding that you remain calm all the time. Just sit down and have a talk, he is also probably extremely nervous about being a father.<br>  <br>  If things don't improve or steadily get worse, look into couples counseling. A baby won't solve your problems, and could even exacerbate them, so talk to someone who can help you.|`|qImMwhUHaa	No, it will not get better when the baby comes. It will probably only get worse. Children add lots of stress to a relationship. I suggest you go ahead and start counseling before you and your b/f relationships gets any worse. The last thing you want is to be arguing and yelling in front of your newborn baby.|`|s4Ak6Z54aa	my husband did the same thing. its just mood swings. we did argue after our son was born for a while.. but we were under alot of stress.. our son was born early and had some complications.. i just wanted my baby home.. once our sons health issues started going away.. things were better. we hardly ever argue anymore.. ive been with him for 4 years and married for a little more than a year. our son is 3 yrs old now.
Y8kjVeLyaa	Yes...and before you do, what about asking everyone to decorate a quilt square in honor of the new baby? Send a square of plain cotton fabric to each person and ask them to decorate it in any way they want for your new baby...they can embroider, paint with fabric paint, print it with an image....and then you get them all made into a quilt...you need squares which are a quater of a yard in size.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Have a party, but don't call it a shower. A shower implies gifts, and people will assume that they are expected to bring one. I personally would not have the nerve to walk into a "shower" without a gift.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Well you're not supposed to throw yourself a shower  and neither is family- it implies that the family is greedy and expects others to provide for their child. Have a regular ole party or get together and catch up with people.|`|KtdlJbrOaa	I had a shower when I was pregnant with my oldest, but was told it was in poor taste to do so with my subsequent children.  I personally do not see a problem with it - but maybe you should post this question in the etiquette section.|`|sAbah6dTaa	i think you should have a shower for each child. we don't have a lot of extra room, so when my daughter outgrew stuff we immediately got rid of it. and now i don't have anything baby... so i will definately be having a shower =)|`|hDnX6Vx6aa	I think every baby deserves a party. Have a shower!!

If I ever have a little girl I would name her Elizabeth Dawn, or Jasmine Dawn and cal her Jazz or Dawn. Jasmine Nicole would be cute too I would think. If you call her Brooke that to me pictures Brooke Shields who is most famous for being married to Andre Agassi. But that s just me. Or call her Arianne (Air-E-anne) After a friend of my who died at in her early 20's. But I hope I've give you some good suggestions. Good Luck with the choice and may God bless you and your child :)|`|3c51ba3982b4a0fa984f838020963690aa	Those are all very nice names and flow well.<br>  I can't pick for you, I don't have a fave among them, but I'll try to suggest a middle for Brooke as well:<br>  <br>  Brooke Alice<br>  Brooke Noelle<br>  Brooke Michelle<br>  Brooke Isobelle<br>  Brooke Madeline<br>  Brooke Tatum|`|6of3tqHhaa	Brooke Elizabeth|`|R1cey1Evaa	Emma Nicole!!!|`|yNV2kRlbaa	I like Emma Brooke and Emma Nicole<br>  Not crazy about Hayley Brooke<br>  <br>  Would you name her Brooke or Brooklyn?

And now she sometimes does it if she's trying to poop :)<br>  <br>  But if it doesn't seem to be connected to anything like tiredness etc, then maybe just ask your doctor the next time you're there for injections and things.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	from what I was told by my doc is that babies don't need lotion especially on their face and you're putting lotion on his face 3 times a day.  Maybe the lotion is irritating his face?|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	My son rubbed his face alot. He also has sensitive skin. I had to change lotions cause the perfum was irritating his skin.. Try a gentle lotion with no perfums and when you wash him just use water and the wash cloth. I dont put soap on his face and I scrub him with the water after I wash his hair so there is a lil bit of soap but not enough to bug his face. ALSO Brecks soap and lotions (oatmeal and lavendor (lavendor great before bed) are gentler then some others friend uses it for daughter with excsma and I use it cause I get sensitive skin and break out easy. How often is he sleeping. at 8 weeks they are still sleeping alot. He might be tired my son now rubs his face when he needs to sleep. wacth when he does it and see if getting him to take a nap help as well. GL|`|fPuZGkmsaa	My son did it as well. He is not 8 1/2 months old. He still does when tired or teething. Its normal don't be concerned.  I agree with the other moms with saying just keep his mittens on and you'll be ok.|`|F4FJVq37aa	My son now 6 months, use to do that all the time, still does sometimes. I would say it was normal, just keep the mittens on so he doesn't scratch himself.|`|dXMdt3gVaa	You should keep his mittens on and swaddle him.

diT2WFfCaa	Sounds like it's a definite possibility.  It's a little early to be hungry all the time, but it's possible that because of all your other symptoms, your mind wants to get a head start.  <br>  <br>  I'm in almost the same boat, my fertile days were just about the same time as yours, and now we're just waiting!  (Doesn't it stink??)<br>  <br>  You should wait at least 14 days since your fertile times to take an at home test, but if you absolutely can't wait, see if your doctor will schedule a blood test, which can give you fairly accurate results much sooner.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, there no 100% sure way to tell until you've missed a period or gotten a positive test.  (Which can be soooo painful trying to wait.)|`|1S5AbPueaa	Whoa it totally sounds like someone has a bun in the oven:) Congratulations! I had all of those symptoms early in my first pregnancy the sleep until 1 sometimes 2.The sore breast and painful nipples.The wake up hungry and if I don't hurry and eat feel sick.Lets not forget the emotions..I say take a test if its negative maybe you can make a Dr appt,but by the time they get you in, you can take another test if the first was too soon.|`|AA11659150	OK.  Honestly, you lose nothing by taking a test.  Because either what you are describing is early pregnancy or you are simply sick and under the weather.  Why would you not want to take a test?  If it is negative, you will know that you need to go to the doctor for a check up in general, and if it is positive, you still need to go to find out how far along you are and to get on your vitamins, girl!!!  <br>  <br>  Based just on your symptoms, a few of them do seem like early pregnancy ones, but some are a little more unusual.  Either way, my advice is to take a test.  Even if it's negative, it sounds like you need a check up and a blood test to make sure.  My experience has been that if you have a gut feeling you are pregnant, you usually are.  GL and all the best!<br>  <br>  As for which test to use, I believe that they are all essentially the same, although I found that I had more faith in the early detectors as the above gal suggested.  The Clear Blue with digital read is about as idiot proof as it gets.  It says "NOT PREGNANT" or "PREGNANT".  No little lines to try and see.  :)  <br>  <br>  Oh and when I found out using this, I was using the pee in the cup method, not the directly in the urine stream.  It was positive before I had finished tee tee'ing.  *sigh*  And here I am!  :)|`|3ab796e59e654e494e3c24254858129baa	Hello Hun!<br>  <br>  All your symptoms were the same as mine when I found out I was pregnant. I wasn't trying to get pregnant, but if it did happen, great! you know? My last period was December 5th & I'm 12 weeks. I had ALL those symptoms EXCEPT heartburn! I don't think heartburn starts happening until way later in pregnancy according to most women; because the stomach is so high later on. Anyways...I definitely cried over nothing and just simply thought i was PMS'ing; LOL. Boy was I wrong! I was also VERY tired and my breasts were EXTREMELY sore in the first month 1/2.  I missed my period and took a pregnancy test 3 days after my missed period and found out I was pregnant! <br>  <br>  So I definitely  think you should take a pregnancy test after March 3?<br>  <br>  Good Luck with everything and congrats with your fiance!|`|6UBSUzUIaa	I went through the same thing.....when I was PREGNANT!! Sounds like a congratulations is in order for you MAMA! I would go ahead an take a test now, because once you start having all these symptoms a test will usually detect a level of HcG ( the hormone you produce while pregnant ). Buy a test that shows early and take it with your first morning urine ( it contains the highest levels of HcG ). If it's negative, wait a week and test again. I hope everything goes the way you want it to! If it's positive let me know!<br>  samdesalvo22@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!!|`|sAbah6dTaa	so when are you due for your first period?? you wouldn't be more than a week or two a long, so I'd probably wait at least another week. <br>  <br>  Good Luck !!!|`|Rd1FLoCbaa	well your going to have to delete me
diT2WFfCaa	Tell him the truth.  Faking a miscarriage is a horrible thing, no one wants to think their baby has just died.  I know several mothers who have miscarried, it's absolutely not something to take lightly.  (besides, the doctor would know if you had actually had a miscarriage.)<br>  <br>  That said, DO NOT try to get pregnant simply to keep your boyfriend!  You need to be having a baby because you both want to and a prepared to raise a child.  <br>  <br>  Explain to him that you lied because you were afraid of losing him.  To be honest, if he says he still oves her, a baby isn't going to make him stay.  He left her when she had a baby, there isn't any reason why he wouldn't do the same again.<br>  <br>  Don't make life hard for yourself, your (possible) baby, and your boyfriend.  Come clean with him, pick up the pieces, and keep going.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	No- you're going to have to come clean if you have any hope of a relationship with this person. You're trying to manipulate him into loving you, and it's never going to work. Do yourself a favor and walk away.|`|IFDfpbFJaa	sounds like a healthy relationship.........I really hate women like you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Nope. No idea on how to fake a pregnancy or a miscarriage....sorry. might have to act like a big girl and come clean with the truth.....(just wanted to make sure I answered the question because I seem to get lots of violation notices for answering just the first sentence. )|`|WXExyAlWaa	This is extremely manipulative and faking a miscarriage is even moreso. Even if you got pregnant before then, he would figure out that you couldn't have known already when you told him you were pregnant by the time you have the baby. Your only real options are to own up to lying or say you thought you were but were mistaken.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	ask yourself why you would want to be with someone that still lover someone else? dont you think you deserve more than that? I would come clean and let him go because you know he loves someone else you deserve something better.|`|2de422e579b099a457e9236ca0a2b210aa	He's just one man--there are a lot more out there. Doesn't sound like he's worth all this "drama." Grow up, get some self esteem, and find someone new--not someone you have to lie to to "keep."|`|3K7ffKn2aa	wow why don't you just tell the truth. I hope your not seroius but thanks for the points anyway.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	If he still loves his ex then there's not much you can do to change that. You need to tell him that you're not really pregnant and that you're sorry you lied but you didnt' know what else to do. You can't just get pregnant because you want to keep a man. That's cruel and selfish and no way to bring a child into this world. You also can't just fake a miscarriage. Do you know how many women actually have miscarriages and how bad it affects them? <br>  <br>  You don't need to do either one of the things you think you need to do. <br>  What you need to do is admit that you lied and deal with the consequences of your actions!|`|zBz10IiOaa	you are really sad if you want to fake a miscarage ! do you know later on in life when you really do get pregnant and you really have one it is going to be real sad then too.<br>   <br>  <br>  KARMA|`|joPJtKemaa	Even if you have a child by him, it does not mean he will stick around by you for the sake of a child. <br>  <br>  If he does not love you, why not let him go and find someone who will love you. I know its easier said then done, but everyone deserves to be with someone who will love them unconditionally.|`|f4AJHCHKaa	This is sad. If he doesn't want to be with you then why would you want him to stay? This is absurd. You need to just tell him the truth, and next time control yourself. Now, if you do stay togerhter I think you will have some major trust issues.|`|CFnkrvyvaa	Why would you want to be with someone who loves someone else?|`|2B2fgmw9aa	You need serious mental help...Women like you give the rest of us a bad name.|`|8y4d0PU8aa	watch baby mama lmao that should give you some ideas|`|yXGlmUqlaa	i hope you're not serious...|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Your pathetic!<br>  How sick is this? You can't fake a miscarriage. And you most likely wouldn't even show up pregnant by the 20th if you did try.<br>  <br>  Sweet sweet karma.  Enjoy it when it swings by!<br>  <br>  UGH! People like you make me sick!|`|PvnnWE1Baa	Honey, you got issues! If he's in love w/ another woman there is no need whatsoever for you to stay in a relationship w/ him. It's not fair to you or to him. You don't need to have a baby just to keep a man, that will get you no where. You seriously have alot of growing up to do. Go to the Lord in pray or something.|`|AA11129622	my friends girlfriend faked being pregnant and then said she had a miscarriage. he then found out she lied. it messed my friend right up<br>  <br>   if you had any respect for him you would tell him the truth now.|`|kU48K7ugaa	Honey, if he loves someone else, there's no reason to keep him (or to keep sleeping with him).
CxCigxZIaa	Have your mom or dad go and get your notes. <br>  Don't stress...you seem to be a very intelligent child but I'm sure you want to be prepared. <br>  IF your parents can't go is there someone you can call to come over and study with...or you go there?<br>  Just a thought.|`|02ouBqEdaa	have your mom or dad go get them|`|YgR0jBo2aa	Ask your teacher if you can take the one quiz tomorrow and the other on Monday. Also ask if you can present your project another day as well. Think of it this way, one it doesn't hurt to ask, and two, if you miss another day you will just be more overwhelmed
kU48K7ugaa	I would ask your dr.  Are your HCG levels being checked to make sure they are going down?|`|wl7tlYOYaa	You can get pregnant again at any time after the miscarriage, but its better to wait at least 1 cyle so your body can be healthy enough to carry another baby. Good luck. And am sorry.|`|P5gvodDWaa	My doc told me to wait until after my first cycle after the miscarriage  Other docs recommend waiting at least two cycles before trying again.  But if after that first cycle you're healthy and feeling up to trying again go for it.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	My sister-in-law just had one and was wondering the same thing so I asked my doctor for her and my doctor said that you should wait at least 3 cycles before trying to conceive again so your body can go through all the changes before you get pregnant. Good luck and I'm sorry for your loss!|`|6bc1daa67c2e712a9d1fdf83a2a7f067aa	I have had 2 Miscarriages  on both the dr told me to wait at least 4 months so your uterus can recover fully . Good luck|`|SVqjzEE3aa	after you miscarry..its VERY VERY VERY easy to get pregnant again....|`|ihL0FkJYaa	one period would be best|`|Gj3vLQJAaa	Most doctors say after your first cycle and some say wait at least 3, thats PHSYCALLY, mentally you need to grieve, you don't want to become pregnant again to "replace" the baby you lost. I had a miscarriage in December of '07 at 5 weeks and it took me a year ((with the help of 1 round of clomid)) and I'm now 14w 2d pregnant, and doctor says I am completly healthy. Whenever you feel the time is right, go for it!!|`|AA11783671	It's possible to get pregnant right away, but doctors recommend 4-8wks before trying to get pregnant again.  Give the new pregnancy a chance by making sure the old one is totally gone.
8nGptJZAaa	I think you should wait 2 more weeks. When somebody is pregnant but not even long-term their body is going through a change it. When you are going through this change your body tries to protect the baby. But if their is something going wrong in your pregnancy (Cells not copying right ) your body automatically tries to do a cancellation that's why you get miscarriages. SO you need to give your body reboot time. This time if you get pregnant don't get overly excited and don't stress out while your ovulating. These are both things that trigger hormones in your body which can affect the baby's health.|`|92fc44be64c0ae0e36696dfdf7936ac2aa	You should talk to your doctor.  I was told wait one cycle before trying again, after an early miscarriage at almost 6 weeks along.  We didn't wait, but I didn't conceive the first cycle after.  Maybe this cycle. . . I am still in my 2ww.|`|xoQxDGAlaa	I would wait until at least your next cycle. The doctors normally say three cycles. You just want to have an accurate due date so if you know your cycle start date you'll have a more accurate due date. Good luck and I'm sorry for your loss.|`|PkjZA2o9aa	atleast until your period is done, usually takes about a week or so. then you would want to wait until your not sore there anymore. i waited a month, and got pregnant 2 months after mine.|`|MAh2yKFnaa	Well, my sister who had a false pregnancy and a miscarriage was told to wait three more months so her body could recover.|`|2HcDEQTIaa	It is up to you. <br>  Only you know when you are ready :]|`|BIg5bWkMaa	i was told 3 months
WXExyAlWaa	Implantation only happens once.|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	No. The embryo only implants once.|`|65RZ441Zaa	nope! implantation bleeding doesnt happen to all, but its 6-8 days after you've conceived. if your prego and bleeding, talk to your doc asap, could be nothing, or something!|`|zBz10IiOaa	no hun but there is spotting in early pregnancy!
kLyOacUiaa	everything i read says you should have sex before you actually ovulate. and that day 13 is the best day. look at all the ovulation calenders online|`|1270a2c558de1c5ce444bf6f3447f4beaa	It can take a perfectly healthy fertile couple up to a year to conceive.  each month you have about a 25% chance of conceiving.  Most times, it just doesn't happen!!  <br>  <br>  Why isn't he inserting his penis completely?  You should do that, and make sure to have sex starting a couple of days prior to your ovulation and up to a day passed your ovulation day.  If you're just guessing at the day you ovulate, try ovulation testing.  It could surprise you the day you;'re actually ovulating in your cycle.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|MAh2yKFnaa	no it does not have to be fully inside to produce sperm and cause pregnancy. It is possible you are pregnant though I would thing that it would have occured on the time around the 14th your like in the same boat as me we just have to wait and see....again.
SEzIkGNiaa	Grow up anyway.  lol, they can't really stop you from growing up.|`|H2IqzG12aa	This is what adolescence is for, finding your own voice, defining yourself as your own person apart from your parents, rebelling against them as much as necessary in order to become an independent adult.|`|8Raw4M1naa	A lot of parents are terrified to see their children grow up. They will probably always see you as their little child, even when you're 40. They just care about you and want to keep you protected. Talk with them, and tell them you feel like you're ready for more responsibility and have become a more mature person. Explain that smoothering you with affection, while well-intentioned, only pushes you away from them, and you want the freedom to go out and explore and make your own mistakes.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Talk to them about it and explain that you have to grow up eventually.|`|rVPrhd26aa	smoke cigarettes... i hear tell those will stunt your growth|`|mHUM98sBaa	Don't worry, their wishes will not come true.|`|132a94967b26774746922b6b7c03bf49aa	I think maybe they just don't want you to do grown up things.  Everybody grows - they can't stop it.  But perhaps you can negotiate with them on some of the things you want to do that they feel are too "grown up"  You've got to earn their trust and prove that you are indeed growing up in many different ways.
RR35cmBdaa	they take ur weight, hight, ask if u smoke or drink, how long u have been trying , take blood test will ask ur partner for a sample just general things iv been going for 1 years im due back in june to see what the next spep is but i just found out im pregnant so i will not need to go back. fingers crossed everything goes well if u want send me a email can have a chat|`|AA10458750	A friend of mine went to one of those...the first visit she said they asked her tons of questions about her sexual history, why she was there, her motives and then schelduled her for a pap exam a couple weeks later.
02b76dd76db785141f368f66bcf7be3caa	It is true that generally speaking braxton hicks contractions don't hurt. I DID however have some that were extremely painful. If you are concerned then I would call the midwife or doctor and ask. Chances are you are just over doing it or have a body getting ready for labor really early. But check with them anyway to be safe.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Sounds like Braxton hicks, they can be pretty intense at times|`|AA11783671	If it hurt bad enough to make you stop what you were doing or to make you stop your conversation, it's something to take note of.  You should call your midwife to be sure.  <br>  Keep in mind BH contractions can be brought on by not drinking enough fluid and from wearing yourself out.  Sounds likely that this is what's going on since you said it stops after about 5, probably when you're starting to relax from the day.  Drink lots of water and call the midwife to see how it goes.|`|hAXJ47iAaa	Braxton hicks actually CAN hurt.  Maybe not extreme pain...but a definite sense of being uncomfortable. <br>  Totally normal at this stage. Up to 4 an hour. They will continue all through the rest of your pregnancy and can get stronger also.  Just make sure you count them.<br>  Try drinking a full glass of water and lying on your left side.|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	I would call your doctor and they may want to check you out. The only way to know for sure is to get checked. It could be nothing but it could be preterm labor and the best thing is to get checked. Good luck!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	its ok...its contractions that are preparing your self for birth...its fine...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|jkFZb2aYaa	sounds like braxton hicks contractions.  i had them with my first, usually when over exerting myself...however with my 2nd, I just got them all the time.  i was always going to the dr. to be checked out as mine would be every five minutes for hours and painful.  be safe and get checked out..but it may just be your body preparing for labor.
VzLkSZ4faa	It could be a blighted ovum. That is where you have a yolk and sack but the baby for some reason didn't grow.|`|YtSGbYqEaa	phantom pregnancy its happened before a women is pregnant then for some strange reason the baby disappears i dont think they have a cause for that yet|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i had a similar situation, and everything turned out fine.  they had me scheduled for a DandE and everything. but when i went back a few days later there was a heartbeat and the baby was fine,  apparently i ovulated at a much different time then expected and got a positive test very early on.  the stars just all lined up in a way that made it look bad but it turned out just fine for me. i would recoment letting nature take its course and not rushing into any procedures until you are absolutely sure.  i hope it does works out for you as well. good luck!|`|6VZGYCZcaa	I am 8 weeks today and I go tomorrow to have my first ultrasound at the doctor's office. I am very nervous about it because I went on the 14th to get an ultrasound by my sister-in-law and I seen the sack but no baby. I am praying that I will see one tomorrow. I am so sorry & god bless!|`|4WNeBRjVaa	I'm so sorry it sounds like you had a miscarriage. Good luck and god bless|`|ef0ef2a4a22cb84c606773ebccd24369aa	Yeah you probably had a miscarriage. I'm so sorry! God bless you!
QQE58qFQaa	Planned parenthood is confidential to everyone, every age....<br>  Check to see if you have one near by...<br>  They give out free birth control with out parental consent...|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	If you are underage, you shouldn't even be wondering about birth control because, it is illegal.|`|0udjgaoBaa	find a "free clinic" they are confidential.|`|AA12116167	Honestly, why do you want birth control with out your mom finding out? If you want it to control your acne or stop cramps or things like that, it shouldn't be a problem to talk to her about. If you want it to actually "control birth", and don't want to tell her, I am guessing she is like any intelligent parent who doesn't want her daughter having sex. You need to respect what your mom wants while she is your authority. Until you turn 18, you really should just listen to her. Keeping secrets only leads to more problems.|`|GidSzywKaa	Planned Parenthood, like others have said.<br>  <br>  I got my IUD at 14, and now I get to get groovy any time I want without my parents knowing. The best thing I EVER did for myself. Call now!|`|zek6Gsllaa	Planned Parenthood is a wonderful resource.<br>  <br>  See if there's one in your area.
ENANtueuaa	Are you making sure he finishes ALL the antibiotics? If he doesn't finish the full course, it can cause him to become resistant to that particular antibiotic. Another thing is, Amoxicillin is what they usually give children to start out with, and many children (my daughter included) get used to that antibioitc and it doesn't work anymore. Have they given him Augmentin? It works a lot better, and i always suggest it, because i know if they give my daughter Amoxicllin, will will be right back in to see the doctor, because it doesn't work.<br>  <br>  It's not good to be on antibiotic after antibiotic...BUT if he needs them, there is nothing you can do....you want him to get better, and pneumonia is serious! The thing is, when he's on antibiotics TOO much, it will actually make his more susceptible to other illnesses. <br>  <br>  There are things you can do to boost his immune system...like making sure he gets enough vitamin C. I try to give my daughter orange juice everyday during the winter, and it seems to help.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	listen to me!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  take him off the antibiotics<br>  give him this remedy<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  1 FRESH garlic clove...mince it up<br>  let it soak for 20 minutes in either warm green tea OR grape juice<br>  if u decide to use tea..use plenty of honey...no sugar<br>  when its done soaking strain out the chunks..i use a coffee filter<br>  have him sip the potion<br>  do this twice a day<br>  i PROMISE you..he will be better within 2 days..<br>  i have used this remedy with myself and my 2 children<br>  my daughter had pneumonia and bronchitis<br>  i cured them both using this remedy without the use of antibiotics..which ultimately kill the immune system..making u dependent on them anytime u get sick<br>  good luck and i urge u to take this advice
02b76dd76db785141f368f66bcf7be3caa	Pregnancy symptoms differ from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy; however, one of the most significant pregnancy symptoms is a delayed or missed menstrual cycle. Understanding the signs and symptoms of pregnancy is important because each symptom may be related to something other than pregnancy. Some women experience signs or symptoms of pregnancy within a week of conception. For other women, pregnancy symptoms may develop over a few weeks or may not be present at all. Below is a listing of some of the most common pregnancy signs symptoms. If you have been sexually active and experiencing any of the following symptoms it is important to take a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Implantation bleeding can be one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms. About 6-12 days after conception, the embryo implants itself into the uterine wall. Some women will experience spotting as well as some cramping. <br>  <br>  A delayed or missed menstruation is the most common pregnancy symptom leading a woman to test for pregnancy. When you become pregnant, your next period should be missed. Many women can bleed while they are pregnant, but typically the bleeding will be shorter or lighter than a normal period.<br>  <br>  Swollen or tender breasts is a pregnancy symptom which may begin as early as 1-2 weeks after conception. Women may notice changes in their breasts; they may be tender to the touch, sore, or swollen. <br>  <br>  Feeling fatigued or more tired is a pregnancy symptom which can also start as early as the first week after conception. <br>  <br>  This well-known pregnancy symptom will often show up between 2-8 weeks after conception. Some women are fortunate to not deal with morning sickness at all, while others will feel nauseous throughout most of their pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Lower backaches may be a symptom that occurs early in pregnancy; however, it is common to experience a dull backache throughout an entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  The sudden rise of hormones in your body can cause you to have headaches early in pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Around 6-8 weeks after conception, you may find yourself making a few extra trips to the bathroom. <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant, the skin around your nipples may get darker. <br>  <br>  While you may not have a strong desire to eat pickles and ice cream, many women will feel cravings for certain foods when they are pregnant. This can last throughout your entire pregnancy. <br>  <br>  You can take an at home test as early as the day of your missed period. However, the longer you go without a period the more hormones you have in your system. It is also good to remember that you are more likely to have a false negative than a false positive result.|`|8EeVtXv9aa	It's different for everybody but the most common are;<br>  -missed period,<br>  -low bach ache,<br>  -cramping in areas of lower belly,<br>  -hormone imbalance, one minute happy, one minute emotional ... <br>  <br>  but these can be due to many factors which is why some people don't know there pregnant until atleast 6weeks and more!<br>  Its hard to say at an early stage in pregnancy!<br>  <br>  you can take a test from 3days before your missed period there are tests about which can detect this but are not always accurate, for the most accurate results would be a week from you period|`|4WNeBRjVaa	You can take a test after the first day of your missed period. Signs can range from aching boobs, tiredness, Nausea, back aches, head aches and frequent urination. Good luck. I wish the best for you|`|Khs7HBYmaa	MISSED PERIOD, HEADACHES, MOOD SWINGS TENDER BREAST, AND JUST A GUT FEELING. YOU CAN TAKE A TEST ONE WEEK AFTER YOU MISS YOUR PERIOD.|`|OhSu11W6aa	also you will notice the viens in your breats you can see and are really dark and kinda look like they are going to pop!!!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	feeling like crap, moody, and missed period<br>  <br>  I would take on eafter you miss your expected period....|`|96HWpdkFaa	I got sore breasts almost instantly, then came headaches (before I even knew I was pregnant) Then at around 7 weeks I got alittle nauses, started peeing alot, and constipated. <br>  <br>  Signs are different for everyone. not everyone gets all the same ones, some people don't get ANY!<br>  <br>  <br>  You can take a test when you miss your period.|`|S4DNQkFraa	Usually at 6 wks along, but for me I had them right away. Every woman is different, even pregnancy to pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Early signs are<br>  --fuller boobs<br>  --sensitive nipples<br>  --darker around the nipples<br>  --prominent veins on the breasts<br>  --nausea<br>  --runny nose<br>  --nose bleeds<br>  -bleeding of the gums<br>  --aversions to food<br>  --cravings<br>  --drinking more water<br>  --frequent urination<br>  --fatigue<br>  --higher sex drive<br>  --hot flashes<br>  --spotting before period associated with slight cramps<br>  and then of course, --a missed period<br>  Morning sickness can be severe to mild or not at all.<br>  If you get a pos. HPT, go have it confirmed.<br>  Do loads of research.<br>  Also, light bleeding can happen in early pregnancy due to a pap smear or intercourse. <br>  It's best to take a test after you miss your period, but you can take it as soon as 5 days before you're missed period. <br>  I took mine 5 days after I missed my period. I then had it confirmed at planned parenthood and my first appt. is March 4th!!<br>  I wish you luck!! Congrats if you are!!
vigFmfLmaa	You keep the same social security number but will have a new card with the new name issued on it.|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	You will keep the same SSN through out your entire lifetime regardless of where you go or what you do. It's the most permanant piece of information about you
smsUZG4Iaa	yes these are pregnancy type symptoms but they are also symptoms of a period.... just try to wait it out.. the test you took was probably way too early..  best of luck|`|vigFmfLmaa	Yep, and they could just as well be PMS.   Wait til you should test and use first morning urine.|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Well it happened to me, i had sore nipples 1 1/2 weeks ago,light cramping, feeling nauseous,oh and bloated,i felt pregnant....but guess what,i got my period today,i feel bummed and feel like crying good luck to u
buoqtZeFaa	It could very well be something else HOWEVER if you have had sex and missed a period I would start with a pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  Good Luck to you|`|62dfb7ea071ca9af65c41faf6cc6de0baa	Get down to the drug store or your local doctor's office and have a test to confirm it. I've had symptoms that mirror pregnancy symptoms before when I wasn't pregnant. But I am currently pregnant now and have didn't have the "traditional" pregnancy symptoms in the beginning.|`|W4X3NCrxaa	my opinon is you tell your mom or go to the doctor and see wat you have wrong its the best i could.|`|m6GSXW40aa	have u had sex? that should help
AA12035186	I don't know any magical formula to help out, but I can give you some mother to mother support.  My first son sounds exactly like your little one.  He was a total night owl...and still is.  We tried everything you did with the exception of the having him sleep in our bed.  I was always afraid to get that started and it become a habit.  We just continued with soothing him when he woke, but we would let him cry a while longer in between times that we went in to sooth him - but we never let him get near the hysterical point ( I couldn't take that myself).  It took a while, but he got to where he would, while waiting for us to come in, lay down and go back to sleep.  I know it's a hard time now, but this too will pass.    Then he'll be a gradeschooler who you have to practically set a fire under to get him out of bed in the morning!  LOL OH... good times!  :)   Anyway, hope this helps and best wishes.|`|AA10888290	I can't really help.  I've been cosleeping with my 16 month old since she was born.  If he sleeps fine in your bed, I say let him!|`|74d22a359a13b539bf60f128a3450a53aa	In addition to some of these comments, <br>  You might have to start putting him down sooner. I know all babys are different, but my baby girl wants to be in bed no later than 7:30. <br>  <br>  ...limiting the amount of sleep they get during the day will only give you an overtired cranky baby. Let the Child sleep.|`|mAxChwHTaa	try not to have him sleep so much in the day so that he will be tired at night and put him to bed like an hour later.. worked for me..|`|h93SVSxLaa	first increase his milk to a full 8 oz switch the last bottle and the bath and pjs and all that stuff. the next thing try not to do for too long (and i know i'm going to get murdered for saying this) put him down with his bottle. leave him in the room.. walk out shut the door if needed and let him figure it out on his own. you are right he does need to learn this self soothe. oh and try increasing  the food from 4 oz to 6oz if not a little more to keep him fuller longer = longer sleeping hopefully this helps<br>  <br>  edit: then i'd say switch the bottle around like i said above but do give him a full one. then when we wakes he might realize that it's there and use it to help soothe himself
AA10196172	If he didn't flush out his pipes in between, and wash himself off, it's really likely he put a lot of sperm in you. That's all it takes.<br>  <br>  However, ovulation usually happens about 14 days before your period. If this was on or about your period, odds are you're safe (but no guarantees).<br>  <br>  What causes an small or unusual period - who knows. You wouldn't see bleeding or any other symptoms for a while after. Implantation bleeding, IIRC, is not for about a week.  I doubt your "cherry" would bleed for more than a few minutes, so I don't think it's that.<br>  <br>  So odds are you are not pregnant.<br>  <br>  The pull-out method is not very reliable, but is better than nothing. But once he's had an orgasm, he needs to wrap it before reinsertion. Better yet, wrap it every time or get on the pill.|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Don't they teach kids in health class that there's sperm in pre-***???? If you insist on having sex then get on birth control, CHILD.|`|kvYgopThaa	Yes you could be pregnant. If he pulled out while he was ejaculating then put it back in then his sperm was still on his penis and got inside of your vaginal cavity. The pull out method does not work and you should really use some other form of birth control like a condom or the pill. Becuase if you don't watch it you are going to end up pregnant, and then have a baby. If you think your mature enough to have sex than you should know you need to be mature enough to have a baby becuase you know that there is a chance it could happen.|`|8EeVtXv9aa	Ohhh why why why have unprotected sex when you are BOTH not ready for a child, there are so many couples out there who want a baby and there are so many YOUNG TEENS who say we had unprotected sex is there a chance i could be pregnant..of course there is! sorry about the lecture, but why arent you on birth control if you dont want a child?<br>  and..when having unprotected sex im guessing you both havent been checked out as you sound young, so there could be a risk of an early STD arising, your best bet is to go see a doc !!!|`|SVqjzEE3aa	yo ucould be...there is pre ***....it comes before the actual blast....<br>  and it has sperm in it....<br>  and that could be implantation bleeding..but see if you get your period...if you don't then get a test..|`|qfuhHeDjaa	not sure about the bleeding for 2 day thing but i know my first daughter was conceived from pulling out and going back at it... not smart i know but i love her!|`|wUVUXHZtaa	Usually your hymen is broken by the time you have sex due to various things. Was this the first time you had sex? You have a very high chance of being pregnant because Pre-"***" does contain some sperm. Go on birth control, it's a lot safer.

xOr67VDiaa	No its not bad at all, as long as she gets something that fills her energy. formula has alot of what they need and if she wasnt having her milk then she would have to eat a hell of alot of food to keep her levels up. you should try some food that you can mix the formula in and get her to watch you do it, and show her that its in there. like potatos mixed with her milk. its not really a worry if she is eating a bit of food and having her milk, as long as she is having enough milk. dont stress to much beause alot of toddlers around 1 are still very attached to there milk. my daughter is 2 years old and still loves her milk more than anything and i wont stop her from having it because atleast i know  she is getting all the stuff she needs. also at that age not many kids like the taste of it, so you should be happy that she wants it, but she still needs food and you should do what ever you can to get her eating it. it can be tough but you'll work it out...good luck :-) formula at that age is fantastic!!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	theres no reason why you cant give her all table foods you eat because of the no teeth. there gums are rock hard and if she gums food welll there shouldnt be a problem. my daughter is 15 months with one tooth and eats everything from raisins to cheese to chicken and stew. she has apple etc also and manages fine. as long as you cut it up small shell probably handle it ok.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	give her lots of different foods and let her feed herself, and try switching the formula if she doesn't like it she more apt to try more solid food.  and try eating the same thing she is and show her how much mommy likes it.

Then about an hour after that, I'd give her her breakfast.  An hour after that a banana.  Noon has been consistent as far as lunch time.

Another bottle of milk before bed.
VwMkiLFPaa	Octo-Grandma can say as she pleases because Octo-Mom and her 6 kids are living under her roof.<br>  <br>  If Octo-Mom doesn't like it, I suggest she find a new home for her 14 kids. And being unemployed, I don't see how she could manage.<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  Quite honestly, when Octo-Mom is creating websites and posting photos of her babies, when she’s asking for donations...she INVITED the public to be part of it and have an opinion.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I think octo-mom should take the million dollar porn deal she was offered so she can get off welfare and raise her own kids.

I think the whole world needs to drop it and mind their own buisness. I don't know her personally, and it isn't my buisness. Her mother and her need to keep their disputes behind closed doors and not tell the world on television. People talk about how messed up these children are going to be. How is all the media attention going to help them?? I have 8 children myself(not 14 though) from ages 1 month-17 years and I would not want my family all over the media.

VKQzj4Pmaa	I very much believe in community property with siblings. Siblings should always be taught to share, and to not be possessive from one another. Whoever has the toy first gets to play with it. However, parents should watch out for children "playing" with toys simply to upset another child or cause jealousy. In that case, the toy should be taken away. If no one is playing with a toy, and you picked it up to play with it, you get to play with it.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Ours will be community property as soon our youngest is old enough to play w/ his big brothers and stop putting everything in his mouth.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	You aren't the only one.  We consider all toys as "the kids' toys".  They share their toys.  If they bring it out of their room, it's fair game :) <br>  <br>  But we do let them pick one special toy that is for them and just for them.  I think that's fair.  I think it's important for kids to have their one special thing just for them.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	My kids are to far apart for it to be an issue. Both of them will share or show the  things they think the other would appreciate.|`|TQW5E6olaa	o0o0oh I LOVE that idea...If I ever have more children, I'll be adapting it to suit.<br>  <br>  How does it work with Ipods?|`|EtCRnDJMaa	If it's in the house then it belongs to everybody!  <br>  <br>  There are only a few exceptions, like I wouldn't let my 4 year old get a hold of my 8 year olds mp3 player or certain "grown up" things.  And the same goes for the 8 yr old, she doesn't really need to be playing with the 4 yr old's little doggie that sings ABC's.  <br>  <br>  All the Barbie's, horses and whatever they play with that's through out the house belongs to the HOUSE and they just play with it!  After a while you forget what belongs to who anyway.  If they really want something to solely belong to them then they must keep it put up & take care of it so somebody wont get it!<br>  <br>  <br>  it's too hard to keep all the toys and things they play with into 3 goups.  They would never keep their stuff separate form one anothers.  They always mix everything together.  We can't just go write their names on each thing, that would take forever!   My girls are fine with me saying that they can play with for a while until the "new" is gone, but after that, everything belongs to the "House"|`|j2mRop0laa	Well, I only have 2 kids- you have 4, so yeah it's a bit different. Not to mention mine are 4 years apart. <br>  What's theirs is theirs and I hate it. They mostly don't share unless they are in a good mood. You should see me at Christmas Time buying TWO cabbage patch dolls and TWO digital cameras and TWO identical barbies. <br>  We have tried it by making them share but they seem to be truly devastated to give up their *things*. <br>  <br>  Yeah, it's a lot different here. <br>  <br>  I'll get a million thumbs down, but honestly, I don't like to share my stuff either. I get a fire in my eyes when my things are moved or lost etc.<br>  *Sigh* Now I feel like they might be spoiled after reading these other answers.....|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	I have two kids, a 10 year old boy and an 8 year old girl.  YES they do share some toys and they have over the years.  However, now their interests are very different.  My daughter likes play food, stuffed animals, barbies, dolls, crafts.  My son likes legos, transformers, video games etc.  The Xbox & Wii are community property and pretty much the kids *have* to share their toys, but a lot of times they aren't interested in each other's toys.....|`|1G3XPiq3aa	My personal opinion is your should encourage children to share of their own free will. Do you also allow them to use your things without asking permission and if not, would you be OK if they suddenly started expecting this from you as well? They may be OK with it now, but I doubt they will get through their teen years without growing to resent this a lot.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	thats a pretty good idea  for kids close in age des....   my kids are almost 10 years apart though, so its never  been an issue. i do have qa cousin with  2 girls 11 months apart though,,,ill be mentioning this to him  ( he looks to me as a mama most of the time, may as well act like one lol)|`|1tmX7xbRaa	well both my kids are close in age so it's not always a huge issue because most of the time they are playing with the toys together (but believe me sometimes it can get messy). i try not to distinguish between 'Alexandria's toys' and 'Isabella's toys' .. i try to make it understood that they need to share and take turns. if i hear the word MINE i tend to turn around and so I don't think so its OURS! we ALL got presents, we ALL have toys, we ALL share the toys, and we ALL Take care of the toys. if the kids don't like it i simply take the item away.<br>  <br>  edit: mind you when the girls are older they will surely have boundaries depending on the item. since they will both have their own rooms of course there will be personal things or things they specifically bought or were give that will be off limits but i SO don't want to think about when they are older i'd like my hair to stay blonde for just a little longer|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	well in my house everything is everyones.  but don't tell that to my 3 year old.  she thinks everything is hers.  i have laid down the following rule - if you don't want to share it, you must play w/it in your room.  we have a "toy room" an off shoot of our living room where the majority of the toys are housed, anything "special" or that can hurt the youngest goes into her room.  i have yet to take me up on the going to her room option. <br>  we do give specific kids specific toys on christmas and birthdays but they are still expected to share almost everything.  i don't have issue with certain things being "theirs"|`|a9YfUGzSaa	In my family, usually toys were ours unless specified otherwise (game systems, play houses, etc were designated as joint gifts.  We usually got at least one joint gift at christmas time.)  However, if we weren't using it we weren't allowed to hoard it to keep the others from using it, and we still needed to take turns with them.  It being "mine" didn't really give me the right to keep my sister from using it, it was just "mine."<br>  <br>  I don't really have an opinion on the right way to do it-- in my family we ended up with two of a lot of things, just in different colors, or maybe I got one spice girl barbie and my sister got a different one.  That probably seems wasteful to some people, but my sister and I haven't turned out horribly spoiled or materialistic, so I guess that's not the end of the world.  Having my own toys gave me responsibility I guess because I was responsible for putting my own toys away, and if all my toys were left out and Sarah's werent, my mom knew who to hold accountable.  And it's nice to have a few things to call your own, kids rarely really get that.  If my parents are going to give me the, "It's not YOUR room, it's MY room, I just ALLOW you to sleep in it!" speech you'd think they could at least let me call my play-doh set my own, even if I do have to share it. :P|`|nfzQkvqraa	Well I have a girl and a boy.  Four years apart.  So there are definitely toys that are bought more for one child than the other.  But in the end they all mix together.  My daughter will play with transformers and my son will string beads.  <br>  <br>  We also buy a good deal of joint toys for the two of them.  Games, puzzles, animals, science experiments etc.  They are always for both of them.  They pretty much share all of their things.  We don't like to make a big fuss over personal possession.  And neither of our children went through the "mine" phase.|`|z5EDtgtyaa	teaching kids to share is very important. my daughter is an only child for now, but we will teach her to share with her brother or sister. she still has to share every day because she is in day care. but I also think that kids should have something that is just theirs. my parents raised us that way. I had things that where just mine and so did my sister and brother, but we had things that we had to share, like our video games and board games, books etc. and that's how it will be in our house. it may sound a little crazy but I think everyone not just kids should have something that is their and no body else's so they can be individual and show their personalities.|`|wzMTFT61aa	basically all the toys in my house are community property :]<br>  <br>  well, unless they're targeted towards the girls or boys.<br>  <br>  if they're unisex, then it's community property, and everyone uses it :]|`|tfdQxfrpaa	I have two girls, so most of their toys belong to them both. There really aren't any exceptions I can think of.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	Well my kids are 8 yrs apart and one is a girl and one's a boy...so their things belong to them. It's not communal. Growing up in my family we all had our own stuff but certain things were shared (just the bigger items) I personally don't think that it's right to take something that was given to a certain child and say "ok well it's everyone's now"  And i have to say that I find it interesting that you would only "consider" letting them have something as their own if they paid for it. If you pay for something wouldn't you be a little upset if someone said "nope sorry...that's for the group" ?|`|JtbeH1Mgaa	I have two kids, ages 3 and 4.  They have some toys that are theirs, like toys they got for Birthdays and Christmas.  Sometimes, as a treat they will get to pick out a toy when we go out.  They consider these their own toys too.  Then there is the toys that is both of theirs.  I don't care who's toy it is though, they have to share.  If they have a disagreement over a toy whoever had it first gets to play with it.  I set a timer and after their time is up the other child gets to play with it.  The reason I do that is because they are jealous of each other and will keep a toy on purpose just to keep the other one from playing with it.  So, yes, they do consider some toys theirs and some toys are both of theirs but they both have to share and get a chance to play with everything.|`|eJ539ejpaa	Our two boys have always shared a room, toys, sometimes even clothes.  We pretty much have it as community property.  This gives them 2xs as many toys and it teaches sharing.  My boys are close in age so they usually end up playing with the same group of toys anyway.  The only time there may be a difference is for games and puzzles and that is strictly because of age.  We also found, what we thought one child would like, the other actually plays with it more.  Videos are the same way, although they might get one for Christmas it goes into the "vault" and we seldom remember who recieved it.  My boys are 4 and 2 1/2 and like yours they no nothing different.  I do not believe it is psycologically damaging as long as they do get their time with a toy and 1:1 time with a parent.  <br>        When I grew up, anything that could be shared was and so we learned to get along.  I have had several roommates, and my best ones were those who came from large families where sharing was the norm.  We had no problems sharing and thus coexisted much easier.

TGUoZF63aa	If you're so insecure about people's opinion on a name, stick with something like Emily.<br>  <br>  I love the name Jolie Raigen. When I post it on here, people dislike it, but i LOVE it and therefore, it doesn't change my opinion on the name. I like it for the sounds as well.<br>  <br>  I like the names Autumn and Violet but they ARE words as well. If you want to name your kid that, you don't have to change someone's mind about disliking it. It's your decision and not theirs. If it makes you so upset that they hate it, don't name your kid that.

Those kids will get tortured.  My friend asked what I thought of her naming her son Homer Preston Arthur, and I flat out said to her, "I love you, but if you name your son that name it will ruin his life.

I absoloutly love the name Opal.|`|MikhcVZfaa	I agree with you, but at the same time, you have to understand that when you post a question on sites like this one, you WILL get all kinds of opinions. I guess that's the point of asking something, so you can see what "strangers" think. Regardless, if you really really really love a name, who cares what people think? That same person that's telling you that Ruby is ugly, probably thinks names like Brooklyn or California or something ridiculous like that are absolutely gorgeous. Eww! LOL!<br>  Personally, I love the name Isabella Scarlett and I really don't care if it's too common or if Scarlett means red. I love that name ?<br>  In conclusion, don't let people's opinions bother you. When you ask a question about a name you like, always keep in mind that some will agree with you but some will not, and that's just how life is.. in the end is YOUR opinion that counts, you know? Oh, and I loooove the name Violet, spelled Violette ?

When I ask for an opinion I expect an honest reply, even if it's critical.  It helps to see things through the eyes of another.  Also, you have to be true to your own heart.  <br>  I think some names of gemstones, states, colors, plants, and nature are beautiful.  I like Jada, Ruby, Dakota, Violet, Lily, Willow, etc.  But for me, personally names like Diamond, California, Red, and Rock are a little over the top.  You should consider the "make fun of" factor of a name, because your child will be stuck with it.  At the same time, it's got to speak to your heart and you have to love it.|`|EWhr1g7Haa	i totally agree too i really love the name Rayne and Summer. i would love to name my little girl when i have one either one of those names or even Ruby.

0xTvvjiYaa	Like you I took 4 home pregnancy tests all in which came back positive. My primary care Dr. only took one blood sample before agreeing that I was pregnant. They then referred me to an O.B Dr. which didn't take me in for a sonogram until I was 9 weeks pregnant. <br>  <br>  It's seems pretty normal to me but if you have any questions or concerns don't be afraid to call them at all! They're use to a million questions from paranoid mommies to be. ;)|`|yKS2UI87aa	This is normal. They usu only do one actual preg blood test. Trust me you will be stuck many times before your little one arrives lol They have normal blood tests they do for different things at different times. 17 weeks is the downs syndrome/spina bifida test (which is a blood test done on you rather than an amnio) It shows the possibility so I opted for this figuring if it came back positive I could then have the amnio. about 6 mo they do the gestational diabetes and i remember one more time they took 6 vials but can't remember for what tests. I'm sure if you ask they will tell you. Congrat's|`|rZZjj0y4aa	Once the Dr. checks for gestational age of the baby, does a pap smear, and pelvic examination they will order the necessary test and send you to the lab. Sometime after that, depending on how far along you are they will give you a blood glucose test and anemia test to make sure you are not diabetic(or borderline) or anemic. Congratulations(some people look it's bad luck til your 3-4 months along..but I think every mommy should be congratulated!! ) , and good luck!|`|rC6gL7KOaa	No it's not normal. Usually they take blood and have you come back in 2 more days to take more blood and they compare the samples to see if your levels are rising. My doctor didn't even tell me my levels at first, she said they don't usually tell you until they get the results back from the second sample. But that's only if they are trying to determine if you're pregnant or not.|`|kT7GVOosaa	yes. they wont order lab work till they have gone over all the different things they can test for. many blood tests the mother can opt out of. like we opted out of the cystic fibrosis test because there are no carriers up either mine or my husbands side of the family so there was no need to test for it. same with down syndrome. after they go over all the tests they will ask you which you would like to participate in then order your blood work.|`|DutTBV3caa	well so far i've only gotten blood work doen the one time. i hope they dont try to do it again. i hate giving blood. i cried through the whole thing the first time and almost fainted lol<br>  anyways as far as i know they only do it the one time|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	No...in fact with my first pregnancy I didn't even get a blood test for quite awhile since I tested positive in the office.|`|Qfq4lpe7aa	They may take more blood at your first appt and do all your screen you for STD's and stuff like that um sickle cell and other things to they will go into it for you! :) Good luck to you! :)|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	I am 20 weeks- my one and only blood test was at about 7 weeks.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	no i never got another blood work done.<br>  <br>  i did get bloodwork whe n i went to the ERm but not like a folow up one from the 1st one or anything like that<br>  <br>  but yes at ur 1st appt u will get bloodwork done for all kinds of tests|`|em8A42Bqaa	I've had my blood drawn twice so far.  I'm 30 1/2 weeks (three times) if you count the glucose test thing.  Both times I was told that my blood count was low and that I have anemia.  Its gradually getting worse.|`|TljXiSNnaa	my first official appointment i had to get 7 tubes sf blood taken away from me...everyplace is different did you have a pap? i also had to do that|`|uuHPneEcaa	yeah, I had blood work done when I was about a month or two.. I didn't have anymore blood work done until I was 7 months.
s4LWmcTjaa	I second Johnny's answer.  But I find it offensive personally and a bit degrading to women who bear children.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	LOL….yes, you live in a cave! :)<br>  <br>  Some find it offensive while others could care less. I see no harm in it. <br>  <br>  Do you really think people call themselves MILF's? LOL. No dear, others call them MILF's.<br>  <br>  Or you have me who calls her own mother a GILF - but it means in MY world, "Gramma's looking good".|`|4gZYucHMaa	Its' what the first poster said above<br>  <br>  edit(I don't find it necessarily deplorable to be called that, heck I've been called worse but what) I find what I find hilarious is that a person will actually call themself that! How sad is that? You actually need to call yourself effable??|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Mother I'd Like to F*(K|`|1tmX7xbRaa	it's a disgusting and offensive word which means mom i'd like to f**k|`|nKSmgjylaa	Mom I'd Like to Fu(k.|`|cYRZpGkqaa	mom i'd like to fu(K <br>  <br>  semi-offensive, i suppose. i would be super-ticked if someone called me that... whatever happened to the good old-fashioned pretty, beautiful, hot (gag), good-looking? does having a child put you at a special status. i don't get it. the more i think about it, the more offensive i find it.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	It means what others say, but it has been kind of dumbed down to mean a very attractive 30 to 40 ish woman with children. I think when most people use it, they aren't actually suggesting that you get busy immediately.|`|j8yZjWqDaa	yes you do live in a cave lol or you must be really young! anywho...it means mother i like to f*ck! older moms in most cases having sex with younger guys. thats apparently a turn on to some people....|`|5eSSAT69aa	I take offense to others putting me down, since I'm a MILF.

VwMkiLFPaa	Yup! We have family friends who are COMPLETELY opposite of us in terms of politics. They have so much money it’s insane and her children have been born with a silver spoon in their mouths. We love them to pieces. We grew up with them. Our parents are best friends. <br>  <br>  But in regards to politics and certain beliefs, holy goodness, we can’t be anymore different or think any more opposite. <br>  <br>  One of the girls posted a blog recently that I personally found SOOOO offensive. I love this girl like a sister, and we learn to not debate because we both think our way is right. And it’s actually something that just don’t discuss. We each have our opinions and we leave it at that. <br>  <br>  Some things we can laugh about in regards to different beliefs but other topics are touchy. So we just don’t discuss and we respect that. <br>  <br>  I personally am not religious but I don’t hold it against someone if they are. As long as they don’t hold it against me that I’m not. I have my stances on abortion and education and parenting and someone else will have theirs. If you can respectfully debate in your friendship, rock on! If you can’t, then learn to avoid it but respect each other’s opinions. <br>  <br>  Sometimes it’s really hard, other times it’s not.<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  Carrie, that’s because online, it’s totally different. People hide behind the computer whereas in real life, it’s not as easy to debate about things. My opinion of course!|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Yes and I have/do.  I have quite a few friends/acquaintances that believe a lot of things differently than I do.  We just put our differences aside when together and enjoy the things we have in common.<br>  <br>  I do know a lot of people who can't handle that though.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Oh yes.<br>  <br>  Would you believe me if I told you that one of my very good friends is a 60 year old schizophrenic?<br>  <br>  And I can't leave out my mother|`|cAtWxJG1aa	i might be able to be friendly with someone like that.  probably not friends, though.<br>  <br>  *shoot, it seemed like a good answer but i was beaten to it.  hate when that happens.<br>  <br>  *eta -- i can be friends, and am friends, with people who don't share my politics, or my religion, or something.  i can't imagine being friends with someone who doesn't share my basic ethics, however.<br>  <br>  *thanks carrie.  i feel the same way.  but yeah, after a year or so on this board i'm confident in answering that it's calling for more maturity than some people have.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	yes i can.  unfortunately, most people i know who differ from me (btw - i have a very small world outside of the internet) are very forthright about their opinions and views being the only way.  thats when i have a hard time interacting with people of different views but then its not the difference of opinion that makes it hard to be friends its their communication skills.  <br>  i personally enjoy a mature discussion with varying sides (one of the reasons i enjoy this site - with certain people - texasmomma comes to mind).  i'm not simple enough to believe my way is the only way.  i like exploring the "opposition" so to speak.  besides i might learn something.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i am mature enough to remain respect, friendly and polite to people who has completely different way of thinking than me; however, they can never be my close friends.  Example is me and my in laws, we are from totally different world, eventho i call her "mom" and we are happy when seeing each other, i will never consider them as a "friends".|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Most of the people I surround myself with think and believe the same way I do.  It is comforting and uplifting when you need support.<br>  <br>  I do however have a couple of friends who do not believe the same, and vote the opposite way of me.  We find our connections and enjoy our time together, but we will never be as close as my other friends.<br>  <br>  I don't dislike people that are unlike me, but why would I spend time with people that support causes I oppose... or why would I encourage my children to learn from people who practice a lifestyle I think is innappropriate?  We welcome people that are different into our lives, and we treat them with the same respect as our close friends, but they just don't fit into our lifestyle as well as those who are like us.<br>  <br>  *best example: We are Catholic and we go to mass every Sunday at 8:00.  You won't find us hanging out with our non-Christian friends until odd hours on Saturday nights... because we have a committment to get up for and they don't.  Doesn't mean we don't invite them to bday parties... but we just don't routinely hang out together.|`|prqrQcd1aa	In certain cases yes.. But honestly it depends on where the difference is.. For instance a woman who allows guys to run in and out of her house/life in front of her children and I would just not get along, someone who abuses their children and I would just not get along, and someone who is into drugs or is an alcoholic...I would not get along with! <br>  Other than that, I can pretty much see both sides to a coin, even if I don't agree with the other side!|`|NuvKPl3naa	Absolutely i have friends of many colors, religious beliefs, morals and much more. that does not mean i have to be them, but do not judge unless you want to be judged. also you can learn things you may of never known or thought about. i think thats what makes the world what it is. It would be boring if we all thought the same. so i say open your heart you never know what will go in there.|`|AA12145826	I will certainly make the effort as long as the person isn't so totally opposite me that they are offensive or destructive. I'm perfectly capable of agreeing to disagree with someone and making a mental note to avoid that topic from here on out.|`|eytlIKITaa	Yes!  I had this really close friend who was the complete opposite of me- I use to be like "I really hate people like you, I have no idea why I love you so much!"- we'd always joke about it!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I am and do.|`|ojVl4Gowaa	Sometimes in life you have to be friendly with people who have very different views than you. My mother in law is a Republican, overly opinionated, hypocritcial, and pessimistic. All complete opposite attributes than me (Democrat, open minded, fair, optimistic and even tempered). I will admit that it sucks the strength out of me to have extended conversations with her, but I know she can't change who she is anymore than I can change how I am. We're family.<br>  <br>  On the other hand if you mean being social with people who have different views i'll admit it's tough. Friends are friends for a reason, because they have something in common. But if you mean lifestyle differences those are easy enough to accept if your open minded. Like having a friend who is gay. Even having a friend who has a different economic status (richer or poorer) than you can be worked out if both sides have something else in common.|`|XPnCeJ29aa	I have alot of people in my life with completely different ways of thinking, and alot of the time we will bicker, but that's what keeps things interesting and how I learn things.<br>  I enjoy other peoples thoughts, but i can be very stubborn..<br>  <br>  But I think even though I have those people who are so different, we do have SOME similarities, either in the things we enjoy, or music.<br>  Music is what brings alot of people together from all different angles.<br>  <br>  But I can say there were instances where a subject sensitive came up and I can recall one time, that I was not very mature, and I havent spoke to that person since.|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	A lot of my friends are very different then I am when it comes to parenting and anything for that matter.  When it comes to certain things I just am not a believer in or would ever do they are the ones to do it.  I never try to judge anybody and I do try to get along with everybody as much as possible.  Granted I do tend to butt heads from time to time but that is only really with two people that I just could not stand from the moment I meet them and sadly I disagree with EVERYTHING they do.  I wish I didn't, but they are just one of those people that rub you the wrong way.|`|5gKg5S0vaa	Definitely! This world is full of so many amazingly different people,  I feel sorry for those who are too judgemental to accept difference in their lives.  <br>  <br>  I have a very good friend who is a muslim and though we have different political and religious beliefs,  I still respect her views and listen to her opinion and vice verse.  <br>  <br>  Variety makes life so much more interesting, embrace it don't fight it!|`|iWrXIWcPaa	yes. my husband and i are both christians and are very friendly with one of my husbands coworkers' who claims to be an atheist. the only reason i wouldnt call him a friend, or even my husbands friend, is because the only time we speak with each other is when i see him at my husbands workplace and work related events. i dont see why people cant love, be friendly towards, everyone. regardless of their beliefs or how different they are. now, realize i didnt say you have to hang out with people who are completely different than you, i mean honestly, if i had absolutely not one common intrest with someone i probably wouldnt want to hang out with them too much only because it would be very boring for both of us! but i would still be friendly toward that person. i dont see any point in displaying hatred or unkindness toward anyone.|`|6nUprmu5aa	Yes. I am anti-abortion %100, and about 6 years ago a friend of mine had one. I didn't exactly support her, I told her my feelings on it, but after realizing that there was nothing I could do to change her mind, I just dealt with it.  I have friends with completely different beliefs,and we sit for hours "debating" with each other. But, it's all for fun. My opinions are not worth losing a good friend. I am friends with people based on how they treat me.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	A lot depends on how well you can get along despite differences. If you can agree to disagree, that's great. <br>  <br>  However, If a person is involved with stuff that is completely against your beliefs and principles, how can you remain friends with them without completely compromising your values?  <br>  <br>  Example? I'm 100% against drugs. I say that with no apologies.  Therefore, I could NEVER be friends with anyone whom I know is a recreational drug user, an addict or anyone who is involved in the drug trade. That doesn't make me "immature" or "judgmental."  It makes me honest...and smart enough to stay away from potential trouble!  Why should I risk being someplace with this person if and when a cop comes to arrest people and then I get busted for being in the room too, despite not partaking in the activity?  Most laws are written to where EVERYONE in the room gets busted...even the 'innocent' ones.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	Nope. If my friends don't mirror me in every way I get new friends. I actually have a small army of clones now because I couldn't find anyone else to mimic my every opinion. Lol. No, I can handle it if my friends are different than me. If we disagree on things that are really explosive we avoid those subjects. I think having contacts who are different is a good example too. I mean you and I are vastly different in a lot of our beliefs but I love to read your answers and see what your perspective is. I don't mind the occasional brawl either. You can call me a bad, irresponsible parent and I can say you are a self-righteous git. We can be friends again on the next question. I am guilty of thumbs downing ppl who give out info I KNOW to be factually wrong or just insult ppl and don't really answer the question but not just for disagreeing.

SpcYCBndaa	midwife is a wanna be doctor<br>  and don't get one|`|aLAmvX5Naa	A midwife is a nurse practitioner who went to midwifery school. Some women prefer a midwife because they feel they get more personalized care. Some women prefer a midwife because a midwife is usually more relaxed when it comes to letting women choose how they want to give birth.<br>  <br>  Medicaid does cover midwives. It would be a replacement for your OB.|`|vue9NOhYaa	There are two types of midwives.  <br>  <br>  Certified nurse midwives are nurses who have had extensive extra training, and specialize in pregnancy and childbirth. THey are 100% able to handle any low-risk pregnancy, and normally work in hospitals or birthing centers.  If you were to develop complications during pregnancy or labor, you would be transferred to a doctor's care.<br>  <br>  Direct entry (or 'lay') midwives are women who firmly believe that normal childbirth is NOT an illness, but a normal part of women's lives. They train through apprenticeship with an experienced midwife, and usually attend home births. (Again, if complications should develop, you would be transferred to hospital or the care of an OB.)<br>  <br>  CNMs are usually covered by insurance or medicaid.  Direct entry midwives are not. (CNMs usually cost less than a doctor, and you (and your insurance/medicaid) also avoid the costs of the extensive interventions that are usual with OB care.)<br>  <br>  It's your choice what sort of care you want. Some women prefer to use an OB, others prefer a midwife.|`|JQcIwPXJaa	Midwives specialize in natural child birth. They offer prenatal care and everything an OB can but with a natural and safer care and delivery. I have used a midwife for my daughter and currently using the same one for my second. Medicaid will cover most of the expense of a midwife and a lot of midwives will waive the remaining fees. <br>  It is a great experience and I would never use an OB after finding my midwife! I would really recommend interviewing midwives. =)|`|Fh4B88ZGaa	Not every pregnant woman has a midwife.<br>  <br>  Read this to learn what they do:<br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_newborn/pregnancy/midwives.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/pregnancy_n...</a><br>  <br>  As to whether or not they are covered under Medicaid, you would have to call your local office and ask. I would not recommend that you spend money out of pocket on a midwife. Save your money to care for the baby, use the medical care that is being provided to you free of charge.

I look huge already and i will be 8wks saturday.  i was wondering if it was just my imagination or something - glad to know i am not the only one.  :)  good luck to you.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	do NOT buy new clothing.<br>  you will need the money for the 3rd baby.<br>  and thts normal after your 3rd child your gonna get BIG!<br>  good luck with the 3rd baby.|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	well i'm sorry your gaining so much wait.. see your body gets used to being pregnant and every pregnancy it gets easier and you show faster as what i've heard...<br>  <br>  what my mom did was she bought clothes from thrift stores,yard sales that are cheap.and you can just get rid of later on. a lot of people think its weird but really in the end you save money..or you can buy new clothes that are on sale. or even if you had friends that were pregnant and you could used there old materity clothes.<br>  <br>  Also going to a gym twice a week or more will help you loose weight.. or even taking a walk around the block will help. get active it will help alot! <br>  <br>  good luck <br>  <br>  even tho you say you look farther than you are i bet you still are pretty! enjoy being pregnant!!
wENdWT5kaa	Well, i didn't read through all the answers, so i'm not sure who and why they took your question as an offence or starting a debate. But your question is the one of the first formul/bfing question i don't find to be starting a debate or offensive. <br>  <br>  Formula does not hurt a baby. <br>  <br>  As per Pippens answer, with my experience, i so very strongly disagree with her. Formula fed babies are just as healthy, some even healthier (in my experience) as a breast fed baby. <br>  <br>  My daughter was breastfed for 2 weeks then i dried out. She has never had an ear infection and she got her first cold at 14 months. She is 2 years and 3 months old now, and only has had 3 colds all together, 2 out of the 3 colds, she got from my friends son, who was exclusivily breastfed, he's had atleast 4 colds that i know of, and has had ear infections. He even weighs more than my formula fed daughter. <br>  <br>  Now, i'm in no way claiming that formula is better than breastmilk, cause i will admit that its not, i will also say that breast is NOT best, but i will say, BREASTMILK is best.  But formula is just as good. After all, my daughter and son are healthy and thriving. <br>  <br>  You do what is best for your child. <br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is don't give up feeding breastmilk, whether you feed your child from the breast or decide to pump and bottle . But if you feel the need to supplement with formula, then don't feel guilty about it or don't let anyone put you down for that decision. <br>  <br>  Like i said my children are healthy and thriving, and i have formula to thank for that. :)|`|723QHuicaa	If formula was not safe it would be removed from shops.<br>  <br>  YES - breast is best, but if formula babys didnt thrive, again, it wouldn't be sold.<br>  <br>  We should respect each mothers personal decision on how to feed their child, we know what the studies say, but the studies do not include our personal circumstances - premature labour, c-section, diseases that can be passed via breastmilk, history of sexual abuse, masectomy, no production.|`|faPKwClPaa	No, formula does not hurt a baby.<br>  <br>  If you want to supplement with formula, then do so.<br>  <br>  It's not lazy (although, as a formula-feeding mother, I sooo appreciate that mentality...).|`|IlyS8KGzaa	Ok, here is the thing.  Stop and think about your question.  You said that your older child was eating formula at 6 months right?  Did it hurt him/her?  Formula is not poison.  My daughter is formula fed and has been since day one.  She never lost any of her birth weight, and is gaining weight accordingly.|`|JP2h62qiaa	we all know formula isn't going to hurt your baby. I know how you feel about constantly breastfeeding. Do you what you want to and don't feel guilty about it. Good luck and ignore the bashers.|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, formula can hurt a baby.  Of course not all babies are harmed, but formula fed babies are clearly at increased risk for a wide range of health problems ... and many of the risks are long term, so you can't know for sure that a baby will 'turn out just fine' until it's too late to change anything.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that life is full of risks, and we all make choices every day. Sometimes we choose to accept risks, sometimes not.  So ... you educate yourself about your choices, and then you make the best choice YOU can make at this time in YOUR life. <br>  <br>  If you do opt to switch to formula, you accept that you are putting your baby (and youself) at some risk.  And then you move on.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Formula is not poison. But that doesn't mean that it's 'just as good' or that it doesn't matter what you do.  Formula is an adequate food.  And if that's what you choose to give, then it IS your choice.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	well my daughter is 15 months old...has never really been ill apart from the odd cold and fever afte injections. pretty advance for her age and very healthy and happy ...she was formula fed since 4 weeks old! breast is best yes absolutely but formula is not poison it is nourishment that allows a baby to thive all the same|`|DKfScL8taa	I don't think formula feeding is bad for your baby at all, breat is just better. I just recently weaned my 9 month old. well he weaned himself. It is so nice now to just give him formula in a bottle. I don't feel bad about it at all either. Do what is best for YOU and your baby!|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	i breast fed my baby for 2 months, then formula till he turned one now he is on whole milk.<br>   when i was breast feeding i too felt that my baby did nothing but eat 24/7|`|14JQ11AUaa	Try and stick it out at least another 6-10 weeks! If you cannot do it, not a big deal! Formula is ok to give to your babies, I breastfed and bottle fed for a bit! There are TONS of women on here who exclusively breastfed because "breast is best." OK, well...I am sure MORE than half those women had drugs to deliver their babies!!! Hey breast feeders....DO YOU know the "drug free is the way to be!?" There are reasons why women cannot breastfeed or continue on breastfeeding and there are reasons why women use drugs while delivering their babies!<br>  <br>  Edit: We ALL know who gave the thumbs down lol. Someone doesn't like the truth!!!|`|2ZoUduoPaa	Hey Girl,<br>  <br>  Formula feed that baby if you have to.  My little one only got about a week "eating boobs".  LOL.  <br>  She's been formula fed ever since.  It took us a bit to find the "right" formula for her, but she's growing by leaps and bounds.  Already up to a little over 12lbs!!!!<br>  <br>  My doctor also recommended in the beginning to mix breast and formula.  Said I could do half and half, or just nurse in the mornings, lunch, evenings, and bedtime.  It didn't work for me, but who knows.  I know Raynah can't get into THAT much trouble....lol.<br>  And Ryland will be settling in before too much longer...at least that's what I hope for you.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Breastfeeding is a challenge but worth it. It takes a lot of hard work and discilpline but as your child gets older and feeds less often it will become easier so you just have to try to get over that hurdle. You are still in the early stages where it will consume alot of your time but you just have to remind yourself that it will get easier. Although I don't think formula will harm your child, I would always recommend sticking to breast milk instead. You need a good support team for encouragement whether it is your husband, mother, lactaion counsilor, etc. Good luck.|`|deIzFnV8aa	From what I've read, BFing is most impt in the first few months of life. You already gave your baby a great head start - if you do both breast and bottle he will continue to get the benefits of Bfing - its not like they are canceled by formula or anything. I always think that is a great compromise, because as much as I am a fan of Bfing, it is also impt that mom is happy. Sometimes Bfing doesn't work out for various reasons, and its silly to make yourself miserable over it when you have tried to make it work but are having problems. Stop feeling guilty and feel proud that you have made it this far, and that you are considering partial Bfing even though it can be problematic.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I had the same problem. I kept it up because everyone kept telling me that she was 'constantly feeding to increase my supply, and that I would catch up eventually'. 3 months later, she was losing weight and having more dry nappies than considered normal. I was advised to top up with formula, which I did. She suddenly changed and was a much happier baby, I wasn't as stressed, her 3 year old sister was getting hot meals again (as opposed to the quick sandwich I would make her while baby was crying for boob again), and my husband really started to bond with the baby too. Breast IS best, that I will never deny, but is it always best for your family? You have to think of the bigger picture.<br>  I do warn though - since topping up with formula, she decided that she preferred the bottle and has recently began to refuse breastfeeding. I'v been very upset - not because I think formula isn't good enough, but because I enjoyed the bond with breastfeeding. She is now almost entirely bottle fed.<br>  You've done 6 weeks exclusive, it's far more than many mothers are able to do (or chose not to). Only the real extremists will say you haven't, and I'm betting their already typing their answers as I do this. <br>  Good luck, whatever you choose. Formula WONT hurt.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Keep breastfeeding it will get easier, i think your daughter might be behaving badly because your son is getting all your attention when you are breastfeeding, maybe try having your daughter sit with you and the baby and tell her she needs to make brother happy too! You know make her feel like she is helping you out maybe tell her to gently rub his head or hold his hand, my sister had this problem with her daughter its just sibling jealousy it's normal. But keep breastfeeding it's better for you and baby!|`|lHjXeN8oaa	this is totally a personal choice so don't listen to any harsh comments from either side of the line - you have to do what is best for you and your family.  if it works out better for you to formula feed than don't feel bad about it.  What is most important is that you have a happy home and eliminate as much undue stress as possible.  :)  best of luck to you in whatever you decide to do.|`|LZVZkSHUaa	You know better than anyone that each child is different I would recommend timing your feedings give her 15-20 mins on each side.  Babies will nurse as long as you let them.  It doesn't take an hour for them to fill up.  Do it as long as it works for you.  Don't forget those 600 calories a day you are burning. Good luck!|`|FLEXqVoiaa	It's not poison, it's not going to hurt your baby. As long as you do what's best for your family, then you are doing what is "right."|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	would it be easier on you to pump & feed him bottles? i know it sounds like twice the work, but i found it easier. <br>  i know exactly how you feel though! it was so much easier with my 1st too! and she always knows when the baby is eating she can get away with everything!<br>  i stored up alot of breast milk in the freezer & then kind of forgot about it! so my 2nd only had breast milk for like 2 months. she is actually more advanced then most her age! she is now 6 months & is way ahead of what my 1st was doing & she was breast fed until 6 months!|`|7FvoCW7Vaa	I think you need to do what you think is best for your baby... and for yourself! My wife and I recently had our first child. He was only breast fed up until about 2 months, and it was a challenge for my wife. We started him on a bottle shortly before my wife went back to work. He is almost 8 months now and he nurses first meal in the morning and last at night. During the day he has a couple bottles.<br>  I<br>   noticed a big difference in my wife's stress level once our son started on a bottle. She was a little more relaxed and didn't feel like (in her words) "a milk factory". If you are feeling stressed about breast feeding then maybe you should try a bottle. You mind find that you feel more relaxed at the times that you do nurse your son. Remember, you have to make sure you feel well, relaxed, and calm too. Your stress level can be felt by your baby as well and if you are stressed, he probably is too. Do what you think is right and don't be afraid to try new things, he is still so young and if he doesn't like something now it is not as if you are "ruining" anything for the future. I hope this helps, and I am sure you will make the right decision for yourself and your son. :-)|`|83nHy2PXaa	First of all, you know you are doing what is best in your opinion for your babies, so you shouldn't feel guilty for any choice you make.<br>  I do breastfeed my 12-months old son and he never tried formula, but I don't think formula would hurt him in any way. I think the most important is to find a proper balance that will work for you. If your baby has no medical issues like weight concerns of illness, that I would go ahead and do both the botle and the breast. The main point is to feel good about whatever you choose and well-rested to take care of your babies|`|Qw3lnnrvaa	As long as your child is getting enough food/gaining weight from breast and bottle feeding you should be fine to do both. Some children want nothing to do with breast feeding and others will refuse formula. I know what you mean about it being rough the second time. I am not breast feeding.. however I am pregnant and about to deliver soon and my 1 1/2 year old keeps me busy. I loved being pregnant with my first and I enjoy it some this time but I am ready to have the baby because I am so worn out chasing my 1 1/2 year old and cleaning constantly.<br>     I wouldn't feel guilty or lazy you just have more on you now! I bottle feed because I have a home daycare with 6 kids every day it gets tiring chasing kids and my own around then cooking, cleaning etc... I would try to do both if that is what you need to do. Do what is best for you and the baby and yes all kids are different! It may take him a little while to get use to the bottle but again as long as he is eating and gaining weight he will be ok!<br>  God Bless!<br>  Brittany|`|T0gv52CDaa	As you said, breast is definitely best, but keeping your sanity is also important.  I have a 2 1/2 year old, and a 3 1/2 month old, and it is more challenging breastfeeding this time around.  The toddler does want attention whenever I'm feeding the baby, but he is learning that he just has to wait.  I remind him before I start feeding the baby that if he wants anything he needs to ask me now.  I get a sippy cup ready for him, and put his snacks within easy reach.  I keep the remote next to me so that if he ask for Thomas the train it is only a button away.  Being prepared for whatever he may ask for makes it easier on all three of us.  That being said, if you need to supplement with formula to keep yourself sane, then do it.  You know what is best for your household.|`|UkQuMykiaa	Hello - I just asked a similar question - I am having a very hard time with the guilty feeling too and eventhough I have bottle (formula) fed my other children (1st never breastfed (in NICU to long), 2nd breastfed 6 wks and lost supply, 3rd breastfed 9 wks until I started pumping blood due to lack of supply - 2nd and 3rd were always supplemented because I never got a good supply).  But with these two - I just can't get over feeling bad, but like you this time was so difficult.  Gosh - I don't think you lazy at all - I know how busy things get, but I know just how you feel and at least you can do both - better off then me ;o)  Good luck and I wish you the best.|`|cZZUjVkqaa	Yes, breastfeeding takes time and effort. Most things we do for the greater good and health of our child does. <br>  <br>  Is formula poison? Ask any of the 300,000 moms of infants sickened with formula that contained melamine, or one of the 6 moms of infants who died after drinking the tainted formula whether they think formula is perfectly safe or not. People who chose to feed their infant formula are accepting the slight risk of the product being tainted. <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28004966/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28004966/</a><br>  <br>  Breast milk is best, it is free, and worth all of the effort that goes into breastfeeding your child.
HXfHkoSHaa	freeze a banana and mix it with yogurt in the blender.|`|ytE1q20taa	As long as you don't put any crap in it like sugar then it'll be fine. Plus I'm sure if you only give it to her every now and then it would be fine to put normal milk in it.|`|TQScv7Tcaa	You can start to give babies small amounts of dairy from 9 months it actually  helps them with the transition to cows milk. I make my daughter smoothies all the time we use low sugar frozen yogurt, bananas, milk sometimes frozen berries, passionfruit pulp, mango the list goes on and on. They are a great way to ensure your baby gets enough fruit and FANTASTIC for a teething baby that won't eat!!!!|`|16vwEBiqaa	Formula is a good idea. Try frozen banana puree instead of ice.|`|qjDxKXENaa	keep the bananas in the fridge not freezer... then mash them and pure it down. you can mix it with her own milk or full fat cows milk.
MHOxPs8Oaa	I gave my daughter her own room from the first day I had her home.  I don't really think she should share a room with you till she's 2 or 3.  It will be very hard to get her into her own room when you move if you do that, but if it is with another sibling I think it's just fine.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Do it when it's right for you. There is no right age to move them to there own room. My son is almost a year old and I am considering moving him soon. I have friends that moved there babies at 4 weeks and my mom didn't move my brothers until they were 3yrs old. Stick with what you are comfortable with.|`|bghotovYaa	Well I got my room when I was 3 years old but I shared it with my  brother.<br>  When I was 6,  I was sharing it with my older sister but when I was 7, she was snoring REALLY loudly and it would keep me awake half the night so we built another room on and since then, I have had my own room.<br>  Having their own room depends on their personalities...some can go straight into their room at two and love their 'big bed'<br>  Others might be the opposite.<br>  Good luck!!|`|FTFd3AQAaa	we moved my son to his own room once he was mostly sleeping through the night, i dont remember exactly but he was a 2-3 months old, i see nothing wrong with keeping your child in your room longer but for us i was more than ready for him to be in his own room, then i didnt feel like i had to creep around our room when he was sleeping or go to bed myself when he did so i wouldn't wake him when going to bed|`|AjqO1aJgaa	My kids had their own rooms when we brought them home from the hospital at 5 days old.

It was decorated beautifully with baby pink walls and fine decor, and she had a huge french krib and bassinet .. but we ended up bringing her in our room for the first few months so we could easily get to her without having to get out of the bed (we put the krib right by the bed) and now all I need to do is get her a first bed. We also are thinking of buying a new house as I am pregnant with our second child and we may want more children in the future.

Usually you will have the missed period though..that is usually the first sign.  However, some woman do bleed for implantation which could be mistaken for a period.|`|LDiBjNf5aa	Not to have all the symptoms. But if you have nothing to suggest that you're pregnant, then the chances are that you aren't. People often try to look for exceptions to the rules to explain their potential pregnancy (despite not missing a period, no nausea, no symptoms whatsoever). And while there are exceptions, they are not common.|`|0mZfOStiaa	No. I found out that I was pregnant 3 months in.<br>  Good thing I didn't drink during that time.

1tmX7xbRaa	i think your mom is a bad mom. i am not trying to be rude HOWEVER for a parent to pull this kind of crap with their child (especially when she's already had children taken away) is absolutely insane to me. why get pregnant and have babies if you are not going to take care of them, love and support them? some people just are NOT cut out to be parents. i would NEVER treat my daughter like that and i would NEVER tell her over and over that i am going to kick her out especially if the child hasn't done anything wrong. again i think it's just insane and you should go as far away as possible from her. i think she is toxic and you would be better off without her.|`|8oAlBL91aa	Never ever ever ever would I even hold that over my kids head. He can stay as long as he needs to and honestly I might do what my dad did to me he would not let me leave his house until I could prove to him that I could make it on my own, not that he was worried I would come back he was just worried he would see me fall down. He told me the day I left that no matter what I can come back anytime and then joked and said now go away I need your room for my television lol. <br>  <br>  Your mother was acting like a freaking 17 year old herself and that's just wrong. Your better off with out her seriously. Let her act like a big baby she'll realize she made a huge mistake. Where did she expect you to go to like you were going to be able to just go buy a house at 18, god I thought it was bad when some parents say that the kids couldn't take the furniture but this sure tops the cake.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	i think you just want people to pitty you <br>  youve written all this long thing out (i did read it)<br>  when really you could have just said <br>  she left before kids got up, i had to look after them<br>  and the court business|`|lBw50ySpaa	Bless you and your baby.  This is quite a shame.  Clearly your mother has mental problems.  Since you are so young, I am assuming that you are on Right From the Start Medicaid for your medical care.  I advise you to go to a counselor.  Medicaid should pay for it as they consider it good for the baby.  It would be a miracle if you managed to come out of this situation with your mother without some emotional damage.  You may be ok now, but when the pressure is on, you may find that you don't have the appropriate coping skills.  Go get some counseling now, while it is free, and before you really need it.  It will make you a better mother, trust me.<br>  It is really hard to deal with a parent who is unstable.  You can't block her out of your life completely.  This will keep coming back.  So it is best if you learn to deal with her in a different way.  <br>  If you can get her to go to a counselor for the sake of your siblings, it would be best.  If they are on Medicaid, counseling for her is covered too.  You may be able to get her to go see your counselor.  Many counselors want to meet the other parties, so you can arrange that with the counselor.  Since it is not court related and your Medicaid will cover it as a part of your treatment, she may jump at the chance to bad mouth you and try to make you look bad.  No worries, your counselor will see through her.<br>  Try hard to be detached.  Don't even think about what is fair.  Life isn't fair.  Try to look at the good.  You got to practice looking after little ones.  It seems that you did your siblings a favor any time you spent caring for them instead of your mom doing it.  In fact, if you can possibly keep them in your life, you will be doing a great thing for them.  Many people these days are wondering what they can do to help others.  Any time that you can bring them into your fold and give them happy times with a sane family member, you will be building their sanity.  You may be able to protect them from some of the damage your mom is bound to cause.  Give of yourself freely and patiently.  Be above her.  Be detached from her emotional junk.  It isn't your problem, it is hers and your siblings.  Do your best, and good luck.|`|vzTGbBCfaa	What are you going to do about your baby?  What does the father think?  Where is your father?<br>  <br>  No I would not do this to my daughter.  It sounds that your mother has some issues that you will NOT change.<br>  <br>  You are 18 now, make choices for your life and that of your baby.  Put the past behind you and move on.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	I don't know what you have done to make your mom so upset, if you did nothing wrong, your mom is quite a horrible person.  I would never kick my daughter out of the house by 18, even 28, if she has financial difficulty.  Where is your mom suppose you can go at 18?  From your screen name looks like you are expecting? Maybe that is the reason she wants you out, because if you think you are old enough to have children of your own, you should be able to live on your own.
77NzfiVkaa	You are probably fine. Especially since you are so far along and your baby is already developed. As long as there is no pain or bleeding and your baby is still active then you should be fine.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Always call your doctor to at least let them know that you fell. That way they are informed. Thats what my dr told me to do.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Definitely call your doctor, just to let them know, in case there's any sort of problem later, so that they know what may have caused it, but you should be fine. Since you fell on your butt, you may have just jostled him a bit, but if the baby is active and there's no bleeding, don't worry. When I was almost as far along as you are, I was walking into a store and tripped over one of those parking block things, and did a complete faceplant on the cement, with most of my weight falling right on my big old belly. I saw stars it was so bad. But me and the baby were just fine even after something like that, aside from the lovely road rash on my gut...that was nice. Good luck and CONGRATS!!!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I slipped on my butt when I was about 36 weeks being as far along my Dr recommended me to go to the birthing center to have the baby monitored, I would at least call you OB/GYN|`|nyuB4POqaa	When I was pregnant I fell and landed right on my stomach.<br>  Baby was fine, but of course Istill phoned doctor to make sure.|`|kvYgopThaa	you should probally go to the hospital to get checked out just in case anyway.|`|GQxqQNRIaa	I did the same thing when I was heavily pregnant with my 3 year old, and was worried coz he got all active too and I had some braxton hicks, but he was fine and still didnt arrive for another 5 weeks! But if you are worried and want to reassure yourself you should call the midwife.
55ee067021e9f50f6a754f34a76c07d9aa	My baby is the same way. If we do or go somewhere during one of her naptime...she cries and fusses the whole time! My daughter goes to sleep at about 6pm everynight, and If we are out later than that for any reason, she is really hard to handle. If anything I can get away with doing something during the day, but not at bedtime...forget about it! No one understands me either, when I say that she won't make it thru dinner eating out or whatever is going on.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	It seems like that to me too.<br>  <br>  Particularly the afternoon one.  It seems that most afternoon naps are at 12 or 1 until 1-4.  So why are so many things during that time!  <br>  <br>  My son isn't that dependent on routine and our lives are insane because my husband works a random schedule, but yes this does impact me.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	although my son does usually take a 'morning' and 'afternoon' nap, he doesn't always take them at the same time so it is easy for us to work his naps around our schedule that day. there are a few times he gets pretty cranky and i have to 'stop what we are doing' so he can get some sleep but for the most part he is pretty flexible. he is 11 months|`|Xc02z608aa	My son set his own routine.  He is 9 months and I really notice when his routine has been disrupted.<br>  <br>  5 am-wake up<br>  8-930-nap<br>  1230-2 nap<br>  600 bedtime<br>  <br>  I follow my babies cues.  If you feel you are missing out, invite the other mommies over for a play date.  Then your baby is in the comfort of home and can nap when she needs to.|`|qjDxKXENaa	daughter is exactly the same. i have to be at home in the morning when she is a sleep.there is nothing you can do... i think their sleep is more important. if she stops then you will worry why she doesnt sleep.|`|AlIktsujaa	<a href="http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/Maccapaccaz-09_Baby-Girls-Hair-Accessories_W0QQ_fsubZ589918012QQ_sidZ685597842QQ_trksidZp4634Q2ec0Q2em322" rel="nofollow">http://stores.shop.ebay.co.uk/Maccapacca...</a>

Jo2DfRzaaa	i didn't follow any rule or expert on my kids.  what i did when my kids were old enough start to go to sleep on their own, about 6-9 mos, i laid them down and left the room.  if they fussed i let them be.  if they cried and were upset, i comforted them.  i didn't use timer.  i judged their cries.  if they needed mommy, i was there.  if they didn't, i let them be.  it worked in my house and i was comfortable with it and my kids are fine.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I have a 7 year old and a 3 year old and I have never used the "cry it out"method.  I don't pass judgment on those who do I just couldn't do it myself.  I never really understood the point to be honest and I found it hard to listen to my babies cry.  I still do.<br>  <br>  My kids as I said are a little bit older and they both can successfully put themselves to sleep.  So again, I never personally found it necessary to have the cry it out.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	my daughter is almost 6 years old.  When she was a baby, i did try the cry it out at night, but it didn't work for us.  She would keep crying and crying, and no one get any sleep in my household.  However, it did works on my best friend's baby, when her baby cries at night, sometimes my friend just let her cries, and within 15 mins, she will fell back to sleep herself.  So i guess it is not for every kids.  Honestly, I think most parents cannot stand the CIO especially when their babies are very small like before 6 months, but trust me, most parents will end up try this method once or twice when their baby are older, and they are just toooooo exhausted to get up at night :)|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I use it certain situations. My daughter is 11mo and she has been sleeping through the night for several months now and if in the night every once in a while she wakes and starts to cry I will let her cry until she gets herself back to sleep but she is my child and I know her cries. If she is sounding more intense I can tell and I will go to her and find out what is wrong. But sometimes there isn't anything wrong she is just fighting  sleep and I think it is important to teach a child to comfort themselves.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	My first baby I used to rock him to sleep every time till he was about five months old, then we started the "crying it out" but he never really cried much, so it wasn't that bad.  The second baby injured herself during her first "crying it out" by getting her chubby little knee stuck between the crib railings and an ugly bruise.  That ended crying it out for us. LOL|`|1tmX7xbRaa	my husband and i argues about this issue many times when our daughter was first born. i am against it he is for it. i don't like it because i did my research and what i found was that it was more harmful to the child then helpful. now i am not saying i rush to my kids side every time she makes a peep. each person has to find a line they draw. all in all if you use the method correctly it really does work for some people. for some it doesn't.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	each to there own. i didnt work for me and kiddo but  can see why it would for others. i dont think it will ruin a child forever but i do think it should be done to an older infant...get angry when i hear of it happening to newborns|`|0udjgaoBaa	My son is now 15 months..When he was fed changed and burped. I let him cry it out if he started crying.....Especially at nap time because daycares dont rock the babies to sleep. It has worked for me.|`|sRjURY43aa	depends on the situation<br>  <br>  If the babysitter is over and i'm getting ready to leave, my almost 2 year old screams her head off. she cries and bangs on the back door. usually this only last for like 3 min though.<br>  <br>  When she was a baby i didnt really do the CIO unless absoulutly nessasary. 3-4 months ago she was yawning and rubbing her eyes so i put her in her crib and said she needed to go nigh night (it was past her nap time anyways) and she started throwing a fit. I let her CIO that time. She cried for about 8-9 min or so then stopped and fell asleep<br>  <br>  anything longer than 10 - 15 should be noticed.|`|cZZUjVkqaa	We did/do not let our infant children CIO. I prefer to attend to my child's physical and emotional needs instead of ignoring them.|`|dKLEBO5Saa	I couldn't do it.  I spent too many times as a child crying alone.  My two children are now responsible citizens in the community and on their own.  They are both over age 20.|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	I think it all matters on the age of the baby. my daughter is 6 months & I let her cry it out a bit, but when she was younger I didn't let her cry.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	I can't/ couldn't do it.  It breaks my heart to hear my children cry.  But, to each his own.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I think it's really not a big deal one way or the other.<br>  <br>  CIO wasn't really for us.  But it's not going to scar a child for life, either.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	Being a mom of two kids, the oldest of them being almost 3, I really didn't use the CIO method.  <br>  <br>  I would give 10 minute intervals.  If my baby was still crying or fussy after 10 minutes, I go in and comfort and soothe.  Then I lay them back down.  Same process over and over.  After about a week, both my kids were sleeping through the night just fine.  I suppose you call this the "ferber" method.  We did this with both our kids starting at 3-4 months old.  No harm done.  Both are happy children and well loved.<br>  <br>  I won't get on any parent's case either way.  My husband and my thoughts on teaching our kids to self soothe were it's better to get them accustomed to it now rather than try to break them of being rocked to sleep when they are 2, 3, or older.  But I never did just let them cry themselves to hysteria.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I comfort my daughter to sleep with love. She goes to bed in a good mood with no fighting. She's 14.5 months old and has never been left to cry. She also cries very little during the day because she knows mommy keeps her needs met, including the need to cuddle mommy.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why you'd leave your child alone while they desperately cry for you. It sounds horrible to me. I remember crying myself to sleep when I was a teen and it certainly wasn't enjoyable, it didn't help me sleep better or longer, and I woke up with a splitting headache. Nope, not my child.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	my 6 yr old has never been a sleeper and so by the time he was around a year old I got pretty desperate and tried letting him cry, I think I cried harder then he did. I couldn't do it to him. he did end up crying it out one night because i was so exhausted I woke up when cried and fell back asleep, after that he slept through the night for awhile (maybe a week or two) and I couldn't let him cry again on purpose. He was still crawling into bed with us when he turned 5, he's just not much of a sleeper, it got easier once he was in the toddler bed and could just come and crawl into bed with me in the night (we had gates in the hallway so he could only go from his room to mine) My daughter (now 4.5 months) is a sleeper, she started sleeping through the night at about 6 weeks and by 2 months she slept for 10 - 12 hours straight so if she wakes up at night and starts to fuss I wait for a minute because almost every time she just rolls over and turns on her fisher price aquarium and goes back to sleep. If she starts to really cry then I go get her because there's obviously something wrong.|`|723QHuicaa	It is flawed at best. Cruel and stessful at worst.<br>  <br>  I have never used it, my daughter is 18m. I always went to her and I have a sociable, independent, smart child who literally hardly ever cries.<br>  <br>  <br>  I *could* say a lot more, but I dont feel much like debating. My fingers are sore.
f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	contrary to popular belief,,,gum does pass right on through like everything else,(normally) i think you should see her dr and find out whats going on.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/digestive-system/AN01006" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/digesti...</a><br>  <br>  this link is from the mayo clinic site, they know a lil more about it then i do  lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  she had to swallow massive amounts of gum  (for her size) for it  to impact her bowels....|`|AA12020090	Maybe you should call the dr if she is saying her 'bum' is hurting.|`|hYXKhaO0aa	try feeding her greasy foods it sounds stupid but when you eat that it lubricates the intestines. also put some lube in her butt. it just needs help not having the gum stick to the edges and she will be better in a few days
OgzHcNMsaa	I guess the rule is in place (which I have never heard before) because of all the child pornography that's going on in recent times. But no, I think if people are taking pics of their own children for keepsakes then there should be no rule against that.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I would have no problem of a mom clearly only photographing her own kid. The problem I would have is the creepy old man by the bushes photographing everyone.<br>  <br>  But I too have been yelled at for taking pics of my own kid up close in the pool. She was on the edge of the pool, no one behind her. It was obviously who I was photographing. Oh well.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I think there should be a blanket no photography rule. We're used to this. You can't take pictures at airports or workout centers either. It's for the protection and privacy of everyone. If we allow one mom to come in and take pictures of their kids, what's to stop a dirty old man from coming in and taking pictures of what everyone thinks is *his* kid?|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Usually pools will make exemptions.<br>  <br>  However I think that the blanket policy is understandable.  Child pornographers often have children of their own, they are sometimes women.  The pool management can't monitor where the camera is pointed, so its safest if they just don't allow it.<br>  <br>  Its also true that pool photos could have enough details that if the photos were posted online some local pervert could obsess over and ultimately find that particular child.  I think the chances are small, but I understand the paranoia|`|AA12035186	I'm kind of on the fence with that one.  I can totally understand why there is a rule, but I have taken photos at the pool before and would hate to not be able to.  I guess if our pool started a "no photography" policy, I would be ok with it - we do have a lot of sex offenders living in our area.  One was actually caught at the pool a couple of years ago.  Crazy world we live in.  Sad but true.|`|ytE1q20taa	Only if they had their kids with them.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why did I get a thumbs down for that?<br>  Would you REALLY let someone in to take pictures if they didn't have their kids with them?|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I think there should be a no photography rule. I mean sure, a dad in a public swimming area taking pictures of his children could seem innocent enough, but no one  wears a "I'm a child sex predator" on their foreheads either. I was neighbors with a man who was later arrested on some charges and they searched him home. They found pictures of neighborhood kids and even pictures of the "crotch area" of children at a local swimming area. The man seemed nice enough on the surface. You just never know what peoples intentions are and I would rather it not be allowed.|`|Wn0nwNFjaa	People should be allowed to take photos of their children when ever and where ever they so desire. There is this ludicrous thing these days about paedophiles taking photos of kids. Rubbish. If a nonce wanted to see pictures of kids they only have to look at a Mothercare, Littlewoods or Vertbaudet catalogue. The people that think it correct to ban cameras at school sports days, public swimming pools, playcentres and the like are paranoid loonies, breeding a generation of nervous kids who have no ability to judge danger cos mummy wwrapped them in cotton wool.|`|I3CNklLKaa	No photographs of anything anywhere should be the rule. In fact cameras should be against the law - and paper and pencils too, in case anyone draws a picture of a child for their personal gratification. By 2050 children themselves will be abolished.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I think it'd be too difficult for them to police. Someone could appear to be taking a picture of their smiling child, but actually they're focusing on the kid in the background... It's not easy for them to spot what exactly everyone is looking at.|`|claUGpVRaa	I understand why there has to be rules, but it is crazy not to allow a parent to take a photo of their own baby! (when it is clear it is the parent taking a photo)|`|Xc02z608aa	The problem is, the minute you bend that kind of rule for one group of people, the other groups will scream about discrimination.  I say the blanket rule is better.|`|4YIUxSlYaa	I'll take a picture of my baby whenever wherever.  If someone has a problem, they can move.<br>  <br>  I want to capture memories.  Some rules are just pathetic.|`|t9S0dqfLaa	What!?  I had no idea, I think you should be allowed to take a pic of your kids.  I would not object at all|`|AA11129622	it breaks my heart that i wont be able to take pictures of my baby in the pool, or when he is in a play at school.  i understand their reasoning because of the sickos out there but it will be a real shame to never have the memory captured on camera.<br>  <br>  i was hoping that at mother/baby swimming groups they would allow photos.   but still its a big no :( :(|`|6qCnpxrNaa	It probably has to do with the fact that they can't verify that the children being photographed are indeed the children of the ones doing the picture taking.  By not allowing it period they save themselves a sticky legal situation if someone was oh I guess..."baby stalking?"|`|LYMhlUleaa	i think that is a gd idea cos u cud b any1 and saying that your only taking pics of their own but taking pic of all. would you like it if some stranger was there taking pic of your kids in the pool?? xxx|`|xwOwsZvEaa	me and my kids were the only ones in our local pool and they wouldn't let me take a pic, i think its stupid.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I did not know this and I am one sided to it. I am upset that I cant take pics of him in the pool when we take him That upsets me BUT I understand why. Some moms dress their kids in skimpy bathing suits and or very lose ones so someone with a Camera can take inappropriate pics. those pics can then be put on the internet. There are as many women pedophiles as men. Also there are people who will take pics as they stalk children for kidnapping I understand the issue BUT I feel as a mom that something could be done to help the mom and protect others. They can say only if there is a few people in the pool and the pics are done in a way that no one is in the pics and they may say only 1 or 2 pics or you have 1 min.|`|cQb2vqDcaa	This really annoyed me.  All i wanted was a photo of my son the first time we went swimming and i was told no too.  I wanted a photo of him splashing about, but they wouldn't let us even take the camera into the building, we had to leave it in the car!  I got a pic in the changing room on my phone, but it's not the same.  <br>  <br>  It's not just at pools, we couldn't even take photos of my partners' son at his nursery sports day!  I was so mad!  The teacher said that they were taking photos themselves and we'd have to pay to get of our own kids!  I was livid!  <br>  <br>  I can understand these places thinking it's for the safety of the kids, but when you are obviously the parents, then i don't see the harm in it.
gieEWY1Qaa	I bled lightly (didn't need a pad) but it was red for a week when I was 6 1/2 weeks pregnant I went to the ER and they said that I have a threatened miscarriage and I have to wait. Then went to my OB and he did an ultrasound and I heard the baby's heartbeat. He said as long as I don't fill a pad in an hour than I am okay. The bleeding did stop and so far so good. But just to be sure CALL your OB and ask, if you don't have an OB yet then go to the ER. But really it is 50/50. Good Luck|`|AA10888290	I bled until 10 weeks and it was not like a period.|`|NqFPyhpsaa	If you are just spotting, then you should be fine, but go to the hospital anyways and they will do some tests, But if it gets heavier, then your probablly having a miscarriage. Either way, dont wait and go to the hospital.|`|SJqgoGPUaa	Are you sure that you are pregnant?<br>  if not and its early on it could be implantation bleeding. <br>  if not no you are not suppose to bleed while pregnant go to<br>  the emergency room right away. or set up an appointment with your <br>  doctor.
0nIwKd5Uaa	When babysitting be the adult. When not babysitting just be the "big kid" sister. As an adult and sister you will want to stop them from doing things that could harm them. Maybe when you have time just take them out for a sibling play date.|`|LEixu90naa	I was there. I am the oldest of 10. I was 17 when the last two (twins) were born. Here is what I learned.<br>  <br>  You are in a fun place!! You are old enough to do things and be responsible and young enough to be cool!!! Enjoy it. Be their friend, confidant, and (secretly) your parents inside scoop! You are not the disciplinarian, that is Mom's job. You can, however, guide them using your personal experience. They are going to listen!! Your the cool older sister!   They don't need to treat you like the adult....you're not (to them). You're the sister!!!!!<br>  <br>   It has been a fun fun fun role for me over the years! My sisters would come and stay with me for 3-4 weeks during the summer in their teen years! Don't try to be the adult.....be their sister!!!|`|X2zq30SGaa	My sister is 22 years older than I am. She left the disciplinary role to my parents. Instead of disciplining my siblings and I, she just encouraged us to do the right thing. She set good examples around us.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Whenever you're disciplining them, think of it as you are helping them. You are teaching them right from wrong, and one day when they're older.. they will thank you for it.|`|0yFk2qCmaa	<a href="http://takingforyou.uk.to" rel="nofollow">http://takingforyou.uk.to</a><br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website|`|5UKw5D33aa	you can be a fun sister....but you have to show them when enough is enough. teach them respect|`|Rk87mqkoaa	You don't have to make any difference between the sister you are and the parenting role you are taking. Imagine you are an adult and you take care of 2 little kids. Be their sis as you are and correct them when they do something wrong. I just didn't understand what's the problem with mixing the facts that you are either a sis or the one who has to take care about them. Course of life will help you take it easy.|`|T1q4GWLkaa	In my family, we are 34, 32, 28 (me), 18, almost 17 and almost 12 (the only boy), so I know where you are coming from.  I don't think you need to worry too much about it.  You will never  be a sister in some senses (e.g. the sibling rivalry).  I know that I will always be more of a parental figure to my three younger siblings because I had to help raise them, often made them dinner and put them to bed because my mom worked nights.  Just relate to them in whatever way you are comfortable (obviously, don't pick on them or anything) and follow the discipline structure your parents set up so they don't get confused by different rules.  Being a goof with them is perfectly fine.  that's what big sisters are for, even if they are so much younger.

I don't eat any type of 'pig', seafood, veal, lamb, none of that stuff. I don't think it's impossible. They can always eat salad and pasta ;] lol.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	Well I'm not 100% Italian (my dad is half Italian), but I am a vegetarian. I think you may be a little confused between "vegetarian" and "vegan" though. The only thing a vegetarian doesn't eat is meat. I don't eat any beef, pork, chicken, turkey, etc., but I do still eat cheese and dairy products. Vegans don't eat anything that comes from an animal at all, so no cheese, milk, gelatin, or anything that has any animal products in it. So I guess it's possible, as long as you could steer clear of Italian Beef and sausage, and things like that. You can still have pizza, definitely. My absolute favorite is pizza with extra cheese, spinach, garlic, and mushrooms. YUM! And no dead animals!|`|hGY08GjRaa	Uh.. I'm not ITALIAN, but I am a vegetarian and I love italian food<br>  <br>  Most pasta can be made with cheese (which most VEGETARIANS eat) and sauce without meat<br>  <br>  And there's imitation italian sausages... really... <br>  <br>  I love pizza with cheese, maybe mushrooms or peppers, just no meat...  I love spaghetti with sauce... the list is endless....|`|TjOEFfhmaa	in my own opinion i think that anyone could become a vegetarian its all how much u put into it|`|113FoyMFaa	how do Americans do it?  we have hamburgers and hot dogs and chili.<br>  <br>  just because someone is Italian doesn't mean they eat sausage all day, lol.

t0sDyzrdaa	go for like a facial or something. i had really really bad acne all over mi cheaks and forhead. i got on medicine and they all went away. but i had all those spots all over mi checks. over time they will start getting lighter and lghter and then go away. or if u get a facial, it will get the dead top layer of skin off ur face and then your pores will be like open and it will be alot easier for the spots to heal!|`|Ffdk1meFaa	I have the same problem, those spots are so annoying!

I had acne spots as well as other problems like roughness and redness, mostly on my cheeks, nose, and forehead.You don't need a prescription for it, in fact, I get mine at Walgreens, and it's only about $5 or $6 for the Walgreens brand, which is the one I use. It sounds like some serious medication, but it's actually made out of sugar cane. I put it on once or twice a day, and sometimes also use my normal moisturizer on top of it, and started seeing results in only a couple days.

Vad64Jjoaa	Yes, I know my daughter can do it if she really wanted to. She is almost 8 1/2 months old and she will lay on her belly now and reach and scoot forward (commando crawling I guess). But as far as being on all fours and moving her knees forward there is none of that. She just knows she can get anywhere she needs to by rolling I guess, and she has mastered that one LOL. They will all do it when they are ready ; )<br>  <br>  Amen to the Pets LOL. I know my Pomeranian is dreading the day my daughter can really get around. My puppy is already trying to find the best hiding spots.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	my son is the same! When he's on my lap he tries to climb off me like the wants to get down and either stand or crawl... he does neither. He works hard to crawl but doesn't get it really lol I dod sit here thinking "any day now jacob.. common now... crawl honey" lol he will be 9 months next Tues.|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	I met this baby who never crawled - he just bounced around on his knees - one of the funniest things I've ever seen!

I think its just because rolling is easier and faster for them to get to where they want to be.. My daughter is almost 9 months and is trying really hard to crawl but still isnt. But some dont even crawl they bum scoot or roll and then just go on to walking... Im thinking any day now as well!! but it seems like forever lol !<br>  <br>  congrats on the little one!!! and many milestones to come!!|`|0PoJUxBKaa	it's actually not uncommon for babies to bypass crawling and go on to more "upright" forms of travel.  either way...no matter the form of transportation for them...we'll be wishing they'd stay stationary again.  "don't grab that!!"  lol|`|G2auAv1Saa	My daughter was very slow to crawl too. She was about 8 months and wouldn't crawl, she just wanted to lay there or roll around. I would get on the floor and show her how and she just laughed at me. She finally got it though and took off, she got carpet burns on her knees and then started walking at 9 months. So she went from not crawling to walking in a matter of weeks. I guess some are not interested in crawling.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Yes!<br>  <br>  My son would sit and then would lean all the way over to get a toy, enough to get a leg underneath him, and I thought at that time he'd take off crawling. This was around 7 and a half months.<br>  <br>  Then at 8 and a half months he started rocking on his hands and knees and, again, I thought he'd take off.<br>  <br>  That lasted for a month and a half and at a week shy of 10 months he finally crawled. He'll be 11 months old next week and is a crawling machine now. :)
FTFd3AQAaa	personally i agree with you when you said disclipine isnt "one size fits all" so i think people need to find a method that works for them and their children<br>  <br>  but i will say i think saying something is ok because if the bible is just crazy.... i'm sorry but look at some of the things that are considered ok by the bible... yes there are mant good lessons to learn from the bible but there are also things that are just unacceptable in today's world|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I do not believe in B.S!! (your right that does sound funny). It is not a one size fits all for parents. All children are different. Spanking does not work for my children. I have a couple times, but they don't remember what they did wrong that caused the spanking. All they remember is that mom or dad hit them. So time-outs work better for them. Then when they are done, we talk to them about what they did wrong and they learn from that much better.|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	Hmmm...I've never heard of BS (lol.)  Perhaps it originates from the "spare the rod" verse?<br>  <br>  I agree with you...parents need to find what works for them and their own kids and stay out of everyone else's parenting business.|`|sxecXFgraa	I'm with you on the "one size fits all" comment.  Every child is different so there is no one form of punishment that will work on every child.|`|AA10888290	I don't agree with spanking.  I think time outs are much more appropriate and humane.|`|31269476570b3829c86de1e8c487e423aa	it sounds stupid and abusive|`|ENANtueuaa	Yes, i agree, it does sound barbaric! I don't think the Bible states exactly how to spank your child, it just says "spare the rod, spoil the child" which is basically saying it's alright to spank. I DO agree that you shouldn't spank out of anger. If you get that angry, walk away. I think that when you are too angry you could hurt them more than you intended to. I don't agree with waiting hours to give the spanking though...by then, all they've done is worry about the spanking, and it's not even effective because way too much time has passed. <br>  <br>  I'm with you...time outs and taking away toys or privleges work for my daughter. I was always open to the idea of spanking, but knew i'd only do it if i had to, and when all else failded. I have never spanked my daughter (other than a little swat here and there on her "diaper butt", but nothing that made her cry), but i don't judge anyone who does...each child is different, and you're right parenting is not "one size fits all." We do what works best for us and our children.<br>  <br>  I think these moms are full of it! They created a group and have their own group, but they way out of line!|`|ddzmEVYFaa	I always ask these B.S. advocates if spanking is such a good way of discipline, why does the bible condone STONING TO DEATH of disobedient teenagers?  Surely if spanking is so wonderfully effective, all teenagers would be so well- behaved that punishing them would never be an issue.<br>  <br>  It is  amazing how many of them have NO clue about the verses in Deuteronomy that  say you must have yo own children killed!|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	I believe that the idea that "spare the rod and spoil the child" has been misinterpreted. The rod in the verse is a symbol of discipline, not necessarily corporal punishment. In fact, the rod referred to is not a switch but a shepherd's rod which was never used to beat a sheep but gently tap it when it started to separate from the flock. <br>  <br>  While this is not universally true, I have found that most people who say that time outs don't work aren't using them properly in the first place. And I can say from my own experience that spanking definitely doesn't work on all children. For some, it is a complete disaster.|`|otFCWMuUaa	"one size" definetly doesnt not fit all.. <br>  <br>  to me it all depends on what makes your kids respond well..<br>  <br>  when i was growin up i rarely was disciplined and when i was it was usaully some sort of a spanking or smack.. and i was the most respective child out of all my siblings caz i respected them. my sister on the other hand you could beat her to a pulp and shed probly still sit there laughing doin what she was doing before but the second you took away her stuff or sat her in time out she became a hysterical mess.<br>  <br>  it all depends on the child..<br>  <br>  im not against spanking but for some kids its just not effective..|`|bsgba6Evaa	--to spank or not to spank, that is the question.<br>  <br>  --it really depends on the parenting style and the personality of the child. Some kids do not respond to anything except for spanking (not in the excessive abusive way), and other children respond to time out better than spankings. <br>  <br>  --I have an infant son, so I'm not sure what will be the most effective. I am leaning towards time outs, though.|`|9CMGO5fhaa	I spank very very sparingly but when I do it is effective. I also use time outs, loss of privileges, and toy take aways. All of it is very helpful in keeping order in the house. spanking like all the time or even too harshly can create fear in children and shouldn't be done. no child should fear his or her parent it creates too many issues later with communication so like I said very very sparingly!|`|5HWHPPeiaa	yes, spanking is good...not beating, though....i think as children get older, time outs usually work better and/or grounding...kids hate to be grounded...i know when i take away the DS or Playstation with my 12 year old, that is all it takes...all kids are different...some need spanked, some need to be grounded, some just need a good talking to...some need a little of everything...don't u just love parenting? lol|`|UCPY4AtUaa	The laws are such in Canada that if your kid shows up to school with red marks anywhere, the teacher calls Child and Family Services--it's not a viable option after the kids are nursery school age.<br>  <br>  If you're going to give a time-out, send the kid to a room with no toys or tv.|`|hqfH47tHaa	Bible says spare the rod and spoil the child....that doesn't mean to physically abuse them (bruising,punching etc)..but many young kids need to be spanked and whopped ocassionally to be kept in line it's just a fact!...Lol I'm glad I don't live in the states that "you can't beat your child law is what is the "B.S".|`|uEo0vS7aaa	What is Biblical Spanking-Spare the rod and spoil the child?<br>  <br>  I do not use anything to spank my children. I use my hand on their behind and that's it. I do this after time-out, talking with and taking away privileges do not work. I need more Information.|`|ZSBZ83Dpaa	I don't know any place in the Bible where it describes or recommends this method. I'm not against spanking generally, but I would not want to mix it up with religion. That makes it scary.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Who is going to raise their child(ren) according to a 2,000 year old document? lol it's 2009 now and  A LOT of things have changed.|`|57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	I think it's right up there with Biblical wife-beating.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	what in the world is biblical spanking?|`|02e43eb2760171b98a8053f0c0b26497aa	I don't know if your talking about "spare the rod spoil the child" bible verse. But there's also a verse that says and I know it's not word for wordbut, something about never striking a chlid with anything more than a shoelace..  But it also contodicts its self later... <br>  Yeah.. I have no kids. I get crazy mad when I see people loose there temper and physical punish kids. <br>  My opinion is you can not pick and chioce the parts of the bible you want to use, its an all or nothing kind of thing. Thats realy the only way it can work. <br>  I think love teaches, kindness is learned... And violence begets violence.|`|AA10350314	I wrote a paper on this when I was in college, which was about 10 years ago... so I don't have my sources nearby.  All of the modern studies illustrate that violence only teaches violence.  If you strike a child for his bad behavior, the only thing he learns is that it is appropriate to strike other people when you are not pleased with their behavior.  One freaky thing I remember learning was that the butt is an erogenous zone and so people who are spanked there frequently can confuse pain and pleasure in that area when they are older, leading to devious sexual behavior.  <br>  <br>  The answer is to give natural consequences for the child's behavior.  For example... If little Tommy isn't supposed to be drinking juice on the living room rug, and you catch him doing it, make him clean up a stain on the rug -- teaching him that the reason juice isn't allowed in the living room is because when spilled, it makes stains.  Then, little Tommy learns the reason why he did something wrong and that there is a consequence for his bad behavior (other than sitting in a timeout, which could be a natural consequence for some behaviors but not most of them).|`|RDgyb7W8aa	How many parents here have had their children talk back to them when they told to do something.  I did that to my father and I picked myself off the floor.  From that point on, we knew who the parent and child was.  From that point on, when he said to do something I did it. Yes I am from the old school. Myself two brothers and one sister were severely disciplined.  None of us got in trouble with the law,, have been married to same person for 37 years or more.  Look back to the 50's & 60's when corporal punishment was practiced.  One didn't have to lock their house, very little juvenile delinquency and very little teen pregnancy.  Now look what has happens, since time outs were invented. There is a greater percentage of juvenile delinquency and teen pregnancy and much more divorce.  I am old school but I believe what I believe,|`|VKQzj4Pmaa	I am a Christian parent, and yes, I am for spanking. I will do my best to clearly and carefully explain what I believe in regards to this issue . . . <br>  <br>  Spanking should begin when the child is old enough to understand the concept of right and wrong. In other words, if a child is old enough to deliberately disobey, then the child is old enough to be spanked. I also believe that a child should be warned only one time. The only time I believe a child should be spanked without a warning, is if they deliberately disobey, if they lie, or if they act defiant (back-talk, talking disrespectful, sassing, etc.).<br>  <br>  Spanking should not be the only form of punishment, and depending on the crime, time-outs and taking away privileges can also be useful and appropriate. Like I said, it really depends on the crime.<br>  <br>  I will try to carefully explain how I believe a spanking should be done. What you heard is true, a spanking should never be done out of anger. A parent must be calm and under control, and should not act out in emotions. If you feel too angry, send the child to their room and give yourself a couple minutes to cool off.<br>  <br>  Now, I believe a spanking should be given in a neutral room in the house, such as the bathroom. Once a parent is ready to give a spanking, the parent should bring the child in the bathroom (or wherever you choose it to be) and explain to the child why they are getting a spanking. After the spanking is over, if you still see that your child is angry or stubborn, send them to their room. Do not approach your child until they are truly ready to say that they are sorry. <br>  <br>  (I'll just quickly add that I don't believe a spanking has to be done with the child in any specific position.)<br>  <br>  Once your child is ready, and you see that they are genuinely sorry, allow them to apologize and then discuss the issue. Ask them why they got spanked so that they are sure to understand the seriousness of what they did. Parents need to teach their children to do right, because it is right. Simple. The younger you begin to instill that into your children, the easier it will be when they are older.<br>  <br>  After the punishment, after the child is sorry, and after you talk about it, it is then important for a parent to show acceptance and love. Give your child a smile, a hug, a kiss, and tell your child that you love them. <br>  <br>  As you can see, my belief is not exactly the same as what you over heard, but it is a very similar concept.|`|O8Yc8He5aa	I am a mum of 2, (11 years old and 1 year old) and have worked in many nurseries, schools, and have been approved as a foster carer. I am also a youth worker dealing with ages 11-19.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, and I accept that others may have their own differing views on this, I cannot see why hitting someone much smaller than you is acceptable. If you are disciplining your child, surely it is better to teach by example, reasoning, distraction or anticipating which situations are likely to cause undesired behaviour than to resort to physical violence?<br>  <br>  I have never spanked any of the children who have been in my care, and have never spanked my own children. I am always recieving comments about how well behaved and happy my children are, and like to think that this is because of the way they have been raised-or maybe it was a complete fluke.<br>  <br>  Again, I know that others may not agree with me, but, after all, this is just my opinion.|`|jdRKZe18aa	I've raised 4 kids myself.  I completely agree with you - one size does NOT fit all and when I was a young mother and was so SURE that an occasional spank or swat was JUST what my kids needed - I came to realize that it just wasn't true!  <br>  <br>  How could I teach my children NOT to hit and then HIT THEM?  I questioned if when I swatted them was it for THEM or to release my own anger and frustration and sadly, it was USUALLY the latter.  I think you do have to be CREATIVE as a parent, consistent, unconditionally LOVING and at least attempt patience <which is hard>.  Biblical spanking just sounds like a fundamentalist GROUP trying to justify corporal punishment - which I just disagree with and I happen to be a Christian myself. <br>  <br>  I don't think a child is damaged for LIFE if they get a swat or spank in their life time - but regularly to think this is useful, teaches anything or is an appropriate consequence or punishment is just ridiculous in my opinion as a mother of 4......    FACE IT kids do what you DO much more than they do what you SAY - so your actions better align with the kind of PERSON you want them to grow up to BE - which will be dependent on your EXAMPLE towards them.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	It's the same as my thoughts on biblical religion. One God doesn't fit all either.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	I have no idea how "biblical spanking" differs from "spanking", but anyone who says time outs "just don't work" certainly isn't speaking for my kids.<br>  <br>  if spanking worked for all kids, considering that the vast majority of parents in the us spank, i'd think we'd have a society of angels, which i can't say i've noticed.<br>  <br>  *ha carrie, i laughed to see you drawn in.  it was the "biblical" thing, wasn't it.|`|G2auAv1Saa	You're right there is no 'one size fits all' discipline method.

But we did clean the area with bleach after we were finished. But now that I have kids we stick to the bed if all possible!|`|8oAlBL91aa	Okay I'll share my very resent story, so we just bought a new van and of course we had to break it in as we have every car hundreds of times lol, I have to say the next person who gets our old car I feel bad for them lol if they only knew what went on in that car. But anyhow on to my story so my husband was installing our new XM radio into the van and I came out and was offering to help and one thing lead to another and somehow we ended up breaking in our new van right in our drive way with the side door open no less, as far as I know nobody saw or heard haha it was late and didn't last long as it was freezing but didn't stop him from running into the house onto the living room floor. lol Okay so theirs our story lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yeah once in the family restroom at a Pittsburgh Pirate game I'm sure someone knew being we didn't come out with any kids lol.|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Outside with me holding on to my daughter's swing set. Thank God it was 4 am and no one happened to be out, they surely would have gotten a great showing! (Not to mention, this is how Chase was conceived)<br>  <br>  (I'm counting down until my 6 week check up, I want my hubby BADLY lol!)<br>  <br>  ETA- Now if you want to know BEFORE children, whoo we did it at work in the HEAD HONCHO's office. D amn that was some good sex too, right on my boss's desk. Aah to be young again!<br>  <br>  Lol @ Carrie!|`|veO1RXrCaa	Our son would not sleep in his own bed when he was younger.  He would sneak in with us.  We were in the middle one time and he comes walking in and crawls in bed and falls asleep.  We took a blanket snuck into his room and finished what we started on the floor.  It was weird but better then nothing.  <br>  <br>  Before we had kids the weirdest place was in his rig.  He is a truck driver.  He parked in the mall where there was a carnival going on.  We had sex in the back on the sleeper bunk parked next to all the carnies trucks.  Were a pretty vanilla couple though. We keep to our bed now.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	In the bathroom at a hotel - the kids were sleeping.|`|0d8fd99482e78511337c03d547560306aa	My husband and I just did it on the bathroom counter with my butt half in the sink.|`|7aCH91ISaa	My sister would kill me..... But just this weekend at my sisters wedding reception we went into the *family* restroom and did our thing. We got a few funny looks when we walked out without a little kid with us though.|`|4WyUrWaIaa	The weirdest place was in the car park of a hotel. It really late & dark, so know own saw (we  think) ... <br>  <br>  We were at a family reunion, and we had to share a room with his sister & her husband. And the same as you ... we needed it lol and it was just too weird to even try do it with his sister in the same apartment lol ... so as the reunion was taking place, we sunk out and did it against a trellis in the car park !!!!|`|eF6HTt0gaa	Hubbys  then coffee room, very classy and definatly spur of the moment. Good to know Im not the only one with wierd locations for a quickie..lol Whew<br>  Oh and yes there was a door we could lock and thank god we did I would have died of embaresment as I know everyone he worked with in that building<br>  <br>  I should add before kids we where really creative and when we visited my parents one fall we got a bit friskey at the local camp site a couple of miles away yea that was a afternoon to remember..lol.|`|njLalVIwaa	Before I had my son my boyfriend and I did it in like a field with bushes and stuff we had a little spot there.<br>  <br>  Since my son, we were sleeping in my parents room and we got a bit naughty in there while they slept. We dont be strange too often, but we will. Also once before my son was born we did it on the floor cause the bunk beds were annoying but we had wooden type floors and my feet kept moving against the floor and I got blisters on the top of my feet, OUCH! Oh and I think we did it on the roof once ;P<br>  <br>  Edit_ oh, in my EARLY pregnancy like 6wks pregnant, we were house sitting his uncles house and he had one of those vibrating excercise machines and we did it on there|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	A hospital room<br>  <br>  ETA:  LOL @ Carrie... I was just thinking the same thing!
CIZjK2rAaa	If you feel up to it then go for it.  I personally could not handle 2 that close in age, but you know what it's like since you have twins.  Talk it over with your husband and consider everything.  Like the fact that you could have twins again!<br>  <br>  I have a 10 year old son, a 2 1/2 year old daughter and 1 on the way.  I think I am done after this one.|`|RqeHygq1aa	IF I was you I would wait until my baby was at least a year before I start but I dont see any problem with you starting earlier|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	Well if u have twins i dnt see why u couldnt handle 2 that close in age.. <br>  I think if its something u really have ur mind set to then go ahead.. i had my babies really close not that close but close|`|qH1YcQ2kaa	i think you should wait at least til your baby is 6 months old. that will give your body some time to heal.|`|iO3BLRTYaa	it's entirely up to you but i think as your 3rd is only 11 weeks old it's a little too soon to start for a 5th. you should spend time with the ones you've got, watching them grow up and giving the baby the attention it needs before starting with another.<br>  <br>  just my advice but i'd be grateful i'd managed to have 1 let alone 4 and wanting a 5th, it's tearing me apart knowing i can't get pregnant and reading questions like these make it worse.<br>  <br>  please be grateful for what you've got|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	I heard any time after a yr from ur last child born is the safest for ur body. ur body tends to go thru alot of stress from pregnancy and birth and it needs time to repair. u don't wanna harm urself, do ya!?|`|s8VY7uReaa	Hun its entirely up to you if you want another baby. if you feel you can handle another one straight away then i suggest you go with your instincts. Let us know when you are preg again. good luck ;)|`|txSiQc7Waa	if you're ready, then I don't see why not :) good luck!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	11 weeks? I think that's a little too early to be trying for another one. I'd wait for the youngest to be atleast a toddler.|`|Od73sfkxaa	My mother had my two sisters 17 months apart, and she said it wasn't healthy for her and she noticed a difference in her body. I recommend waiting, you need more time for your body to heal and get back to normal. They say two years between kids is ideal. <br>  <br>  Also, enjoy being a family of 6 total for now. Let the other children get use to this new baby first before you add a new addition to the family.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!

smsUZG4Iaa	symptoms of a miscarriage include:<br>  <br>  Vaginal bleeding that may be light or heavy, constant or irregular. Although bleeding is often the first sign of a miscarriage, first-trimester bleeding may also occur with a normal pregnancy. But bleeding with pain is a sign that miscarriage is more likely.<br>  Pain. You may have pelvic cramps, abdominal pain, or a persistent, dull ache in your lower back. Pain may start a few hours to several days after bleeding has begun.<br>  Blood clots or grayish (fetal) tissue passing from the vagina.<br>  It is not always easy to tell whether a miscarriage is taking place. A miscarriage often does not occur as a single event but as a chain of events over several days. One woman's physical experience of a miscarriage can be very different from another woman's experience.|`|VS8mactUaa	Sever cramping, Bleeding, cramping and bleeding, extreme loss of dramatic symptoms, these are the big indicators if you notice any of the above be sure to contact your doctor right away.|`|8RfmosODaa	when i had my miscarriage i didn't have really any symptoms. I had light brown bleeding at first which within 2 hours turned to red bleeding and I had heavy bleeding later in the day. I did not have cramping while I was miscarrying but did before and after.|`|URbMCRFLaa	I had spotting and severe cramps through my lower back- both sides. I went to the ER where they said everything seemed okay and my cervix was closed and I had an ultrasound to see the heartbeat. This was around 7 weeks. A day later I had an appointment with my gyno where I had another ultrasound and was checked again. I was having old blood and really bad cramps but still everything seemed fine. I was told not to do a lot of stairs and to take it easy, though I was not put on bedrest. I went back to work and up three small flights of stairs. I was sitting at my desk and was getting sicker and sicker from the cramps through my back. I went to the bathroom and had fresh blood clots fall out of me (sorry for the TMI). I called my doctor after calling my assistant to bring my a pad because I was bleeding so much I couldn't go and grab one then go back to the bathroom. My doctor wouldn't talk to me and instead had a nurse tell me that I'm fine and they just saw the baby an hour ago. That night after work I knew something was really wrong when I was too sick to do anything but lay in bed crying in pain. Went to the ER where they told me I was miscarrying.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	I had really bad pains on my lower left side and I started bleeding. That was it. that was enough
yCwPxulYaa	I think that I would probably go but put my baby in a sling.  I went to Mardi Gras this past weekend and it was loud and there were crazy drunks i'm sure, but I just put my baby in her sling and she slept the whole time.  She woke up for a few minutes and really enjoyed seeing the floats and hearing the music. <br>  <br>  But, if you don't feel comfortable, then don't go and just explain that to your friends.  But if it were me, I would go, and just stay away from anyone that was not safe.<br>  <br>  By the way, my isish fest does not have people falling over drunk.  They go out afterwards.|`|Xc02z608aa	They probably just don't really understand the fact that an Irish Fest full of drunks and loud parades is not the ideal mother/baby outing.  He's just 4 months old.  I wouldn't have brought my son either.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	Put him in a sling or wrap and keep him close to you. He will enjoy it.|`|qjDxKXENaa	i would do the same as your decision.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I do feel that some people who dont have kids are not as safe in choices they make. At 4 months old I might depending on how the crowds are. If it is severally crowded then prob not. if its like a carnival with room to move I might do it. BUT if its know for heavy drinking then NO!! If her does not like loud sounds then no i would not take him.|`|65RZ441Zaa	you did the right thing, if you can't go you can't go. Don't sacrifice your son's safety or your sanity. They will get over it. tell them you need more of a notice, to get a babysitter (or family member lined up) !! Smart mommy!|`|NVP7CAhJaa	i would of done the same. smart choice!!|`|1S7uXsInaa	My local Irish Fest does not have drunks falling down on the street or running into people, that is usually after the parade is over and everyone hits the local bars.  I took my son to a fall parade, he was about 6 months and he fell asleep. . .the sirens did startle him, but it was overall a great time for us to get out of the house and so something.  It is your choice what you want to do, if this is one event you do not want to partake in.  As long as you son is not an excuse for you not getting out with friends and having a good time.|`|1q1HTBrmaa	I would of brought him!! Let him have all sorts of experiences! Get him used to loud noises so he can go see fireworks on the 4th of July! My baby LOVED it! He has you there to protect him from all the "drunks" hee hee-  I want my son to have many experiences to tell him about when he is older, and places we went, things we did to fill up pages in his baby book. I know if my mom told me that when I was 4 mo. old I attended an Irish Fest, I would think it was awesome!!|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Apparently this is your first baby and you are overprotective of your child. If you want to go, make sure you have your baby dressed warm, with hoodie and extra warm blanket. Stay for a while and enjoy yourself, your baby needs to get used to noise in life and when you protect them from the environment so much when they get bigger they are very sensitive and can't cope. Nothing will happen as long as you are there protecting your baby. Relax and enjoy life and let your baby have fun too. ( I know you are trying to be a good mom and  you are, but you can have fun too.)|`|ojVl4Gowaa	I would have made the same choice and passed on the Irish Fest. Anywhere there is public drinking is not an ideal place for mommy and a young infant! Sometimes people, even those who have children, don't see the danger in activities they connsider harmless. They only recognize immediate dangers, but not situational dangers. I knew a woman who was surprised she was mugged and beaten when she jogged by herself in a park at night. She thought that parks were safe, and no one would rob a jogger because you don't carry a wallet/purse. I was shocked at her logic, of course seedy people hang out at parks at night and sometimes they just beat people for the hell of it. <br>  <br>  You're a good mother to consider the well being of your son and don't let anyone make you feel overprotective of an infant. They're called babies for a reason!|`|txv7TIgiaa	they just don't understand you can just drop your baby on people and go party...and if you feel it is not a safe environment for your baby don't go... i barley even hang out with my friends who don't have kids because they are just cluless and have unrealistic expectations of what you can do with a baby... and exspecially a baby as young as your...good job you are being a good mom... i have never left my daughter for more than 20 minutes, and she is 14 months old and the only person i have left her with is her dad!|`|g7r4W2vRaa	I would have done the same thing. Putting your baby's safety is first priority. <br>  <br>  I do agree that people with no children do not  understand how things are with haveing a baby.  They also do not have the mommy brain so its not like they are not using their brain they just dont have mommy brain.|`|WAKTa4Fcaa	I know exactly how you feel. People (not all) that do not have children expect you to be able to drop everything to join in on some 'fun'. Although, they seem to forget the responsibilities that you have being a mother.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about it. Just ignore it. They'll get over it. :P|`|29WreaS9aa	i would have done the same|`|ADuNqxi0aa	I think that some people without kids don't understand what it means to be a parent, When you have child you cant just drop everything and go out to party or a festival without planning everything in advance. And in the end it is your child's safety and well being that is most important. I have a 7month old daughter and if I was in your position I would not take her. But what you do is up to you!<br>  <br>  I would be afraid that something would happen to my baby, and its not even just the fact that something could happen physically but why would someone want to put their infant in a situation where they will most likely go away smelling like alcohol and smoke. not to mention what else might be lingering around the area. Plus you may be tempted to have a few drinks (which there is nothing with, when your without your children).  Good luck!|`|Kxwyy0Eaaa	My daughter is 17 months and I would be hesitant to take her to something like that. She might like the parade, but not all of the noises. There might be too many drunk people there. Also, there might be smokers who aren't considerate about smoking around a child. (We took our daughter to the county fair last July when she was ten months old. It was fine, except she didn't like the petting zoo. No smokers except for the woman whose one child looked under two and looked pregnant with number two. Poor kids.)<br>  <br>  Some people who don't have children don't understand. Suggest an alternate outing, or invite her over. Your friend probably does want to go to the festival, but more importantly, she probably wants to do something with you.<br>  <br>  Also, at four months, I wouldn't have left my daughter with just anybody. At four months she did not get babysitters as nobody was really qualified except for our parents and my sister and one of my husband's aunts. (My parents, in-laws and sister are the only ones who have baby sat, except for one friend one time. However, my daughter woke up crying and freaked out [she was seven months] when she realized she was home, but Mommy and Daddy weren't around. I came home quickly.)<br>  <br>  Suggest something different and explain your reasoning. She might understand. (If you feel comfortable drinking, and I really didn't at that age since she was still breastfeeding constantly, maybe pick up a six pack of Guinness at least. It's a great beer.)|`|AA12035186	Yes, I would have done the same.  If it is going to be a bad experience for your child, why put him through that.  I have often felt that people who don't have kids don't really understand.  If they walked a mile in your shoes, they'd probably be thinking differently.
8Zk3t6yAaa	i love both names...i am a big fan of unique names...if i was naming my son the same i would make his middle name one of these:<br>  Jomei...japanese for "spreading light"<br>  Eros.....greek for "love"<br>  Addae..Ghanian(africa decent) for "morning sun"|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Don't like them.

For example Kadori James.  Not that James is the right name, rather just an example of how Kadori sounds good with a strong, short middle name.  Also, the first letter of the middle name should be a strong consonant.  Kadori wouldn't sound good followed by a vowel sound.|`|Wl8tRVWBaa	My cousin is called Kade. Could you not just use that?

My husband's parents accept his choices in women, and knew from when he was a teenager that he preferred dating non-white girls so bringing me home was not a shock to them.|`|bMyq2nOTaa	Not at all... My birth parents are of different races: white (father), Spanish (mother), and here I am! <br>  <br>  As long as members of the race my child was dating, didn't target my child, because *they* feel it's wrong, I can honestly say I would welcome it... And, I want my child treated well, regardless of skin color.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm attracted to American Indians; always have been! I'm in Oklahoma, too, so I've been around plenty!|`|6M2ikJfkaa	Speaking as the child of a white and black couple, not at all. However, my white mother was given a hard time by a few family members about marrying my black father...not by parents, but a few family members were skeptical. They all came to love him in the end, though.<br>  <br>  Edit: To whoever said "Yes, yes, yes. Different races have different beliefs, life styles, and other things that don't blend."<br>  <br>  That's what we call a stereotype.<br>  <br>  Edit again.... Interracial marriage is not illegal in the U.S.|`|txv7TIgiaa	well i guess i am not the oppinion you wanted on this but i am white and my boyfreind is black, we have a 14 month old baby girl...my parents have no problem with our relationship... in fact somtimes i think they like my boyfriend better than they like me.lol... you might run into some racist *** holes i sure have but i say who give a **** what they think!!! don't think about skin color think about the personality and values of a person...|`|R5IAmQAVaa	Yes, I would oppose it.  I can't say I would forbid it, when they are old enough to date, that I will respect who they choose, but I certainly would not be comfortable with my child in an interracial relationship.<br>  <br>  I'm not proud of it, but that's the way I feel.|`|HWSMljLoaa	those blacks, queerosexuals and mexicans are the scum of the earth IMO. haha jk, i'm not THAT racist. i wouldn't mind as long as both parties are happy, and it's a healthy relationship.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	Um not all white people have a problem with interracial dating, dude. <br>  <br>  And I doubt you're going to get any HONEST answers on here either.|`|LuND86GIaa	I would rather my child marry a mexican or a white person, BUT if they where in love with someone else I'd get the "f" over it.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	who cares what they look like, as long as they treated my kid with respect and loved him/her for who they are , then like i said who cares!|`|AA12127693	Nope not at all - and I was raised in Louisiana were sadly racism still exists daily!|`|G4qP2gATaa	Pff.

vygYFdsSaa	Honestly it sounds like the perfect time to give your son a sibling. Perhaps you and your son can work on convincing hubby together :) Make him realize how great of a time this is! Good luck. You shouldn't just forget about it.|`|9wojIiiWaa	im thinkin he is scarred to hav another baby because of what happen to this one with his Ex wife, and if you split it would hurt him alot... so i would say have a sit down and talk about what exactly you would do and when you want to have the baby, and maybe just not protect youselfs anymore and if your meant to have one, one will come|`|hIzQyflqaa	Sit him down and explain to him how serious you are about this and how much you want it! keep talking about it until he finally wants it too! get your son to keep dropping hints too lol! good luck|`|l1UwQRBTaa	I think you should give your partner some time. He probably worries that he will loose you as he lost his previous partner.<br>  <br>  Give him time, he said he would like a child with you, so you will get your dream! Let his think about it. Maybe you should ask a time boundary? After all, it could take time to concieve.<br>  <br>  And no matter your adopted sons age, he will still appreciate a brother or sister.|`|VbMjHUDiaa	If you feel deep inside that you (and him lol) want a baby, then go for it. but amke sure you can provide a happy and safe enviroment for it :] we dont need anymore chavy babies around lol :P|`|0zZZHXvVaa	sadly if he doesn't want one yet you cant make him you need to sit him down and explain the reason you want one and get him to see it from your point of view he may feel you will leave him like his ex did or maybe he feels that only being together for two years is not long enough just yet in time it will happen just do it when your both ready or the relationship may turn rocky|`|dwFPvNNFaa	I'm sorry for what you're going through. It seems to me that you need to make the choice between staying with this man and waiting to have a baby or leaving him to find someone who is ready for a baby now. There is no wrong answer to make. You just need to decide what is most important to you.<br>  <br>  If you decide to stay with him and wait for a baby than it might help you to deal with it if you could find work somewhere else. Somewhere where the idea of a baby isn't in your face all the time.<br>  <br>  If you decide to leave him consider trying to maintain a friendship with him for your son at least.<br>  <br>  This is not an easy choice to make I hope you find a path that makes you happy.<br>  <br>  If you're ready for the commitment of having a baby than maybe you're ready for the commitment of marriage. The commitment of marriage might be all it takes for him to be ready for a baby. If you haven't talked with him about that, I'd advise it.|`|mgiJVjaKaa	Unfortunately you can't make him want one sooner if he doesn't. But it might be helpful to sit with him and figure out why he wants to wait - what is he waiting for? Maybe he has practical concerns that you can discuss (i.e. money, larger place to live, work changes, stress, etc) and figure out if they are worthy of putting a baby off or what you can do to help alleviate them.  Who knows, he may be really concerned about his past relationship with his son's biological mom and taht is factoring into all of it. You can also work up a map, together, of what you would need and where you want to be in life before you have the baby. That way it isn't some indefinite "some day" that can be put off and is something that is very real and in the future.<br>  <br>  Edit: there is nothing you can do to "prove" to him that history won't repeat. He just has to trust you, and you prove it by being you, every day. If this is a really big issue with him, maybe you guys should seek counseling to just get all the issues out in the air in a productive fashion.|`|AA10888290	You need to decide if not having a baby is a deal breaker.  If it is, then you should move on now.  What are his reasons for not wanting one?
QSodlfMraa	maybe in 5 more weeks, at 18 weeks was my first movement and i am i first time time mommy.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I felt fluttering at 13 weeks,it feels like there are butterflies in your stomach. I am 15 weeks and 3 weeks today|`|6ycnSoaRaa	well they say that women feel it at different times, but Im 14 wks and a couple days.... I felt mine move ( little butterflies) 2 nights ago. so yes, I would suppose that it could be..... my doctor told me that it was just gas, but it wasn't. it felt nothing like gas. just be patient- is what my mom says.... that I will feel it soon enough and wish to God that it would quit moving.. hahah( to sleep, I suppose) Good luck- and CONGRATS|`|kT7GVOosaa	i did and I thought it was kicks and movement until I felt a really kick and movement. it was fun for the time being to think it was a kick but take it from personal experience. do brag about it to other mothers because they will tell you you are wrong and sometimes make you feel little. that is what happened to me.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Could just be gas moving around when baby moves, but some who are on the thinner side will feel theirs early. I didn't feel mine until 17 weeks and I started at 112 lbs.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	I think it is too early for it being your first.
7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	No, definitely not. Because you're not really pregnant yet... the egg is fertilized but it probably hasn't implanted at this point.. and you won't start getting pregnancy symptoms until around week 5 or 6 of pregnancy.. so that won't be until about a week after you miss your period.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	I was only 5 days late on my period. I took a hpt and it was positive, the doctor's test said neg. I requested a blood test and there was barely enough hormone to register. Technically, since doctors calculate your due date by the first day of your last period, I am 5 weeks, but the doc said since there was barely any hormone, I probably only conceived about a week ago. I have prego symptoms. Hope that helps.|`|fjWPhB8Daa	my sister didn't know she was pregnant intill she was like two months. that's is to early you might just have a bladder infection but wait to see if you will have your period. i know someone who didn't miss there period intill they were four months pregnant!|`|8EeVtXv9aa	No thats why too early, however it could be implantation bleeding but again could still be a little too early!<br>  Your best bet is to take a test when your period is due or even go to your local doctor as it could be an STD or UTI ?! xxx|`|Cxdxo393aa	mine started really soon but not as soon as you.  i started feeling the very first signs about 2 weeks after conception|`|OF7ZHq19aa	No the earliest you can get symptoms are around 4 weeks but most women get symptoms at 6 weeks|`|OhSu11W6aa	I knew i was preg. my first symptom was sore boobs and then the veins was really dark and looked like they was going to bust.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Breast tenderness is the earliest symptom. You are far too early to be feeling symptoms like this, sorry.|`|gieEWY1Qaa	The only sign I had was missed period. And none till a few days ago. I was starting to get worried cause I am 8 1/2 weeks pregnant. But last night clinging to the toilet made me realize that I should have just been happy.<br>  <br>  It is possible you are having signs but relax and wait. Take a test when you miss your period.|`|Fn6vayT4aa	4 weeks after sex i think|`|AA11659150	Hm.  That soon you won't have a clue.  In the next week or so, if you are paying attention and you are pregnant, you MIGHT be able to feel the implantation pains.  But this early?  You will have no symptoms that are noticeable.  <br>  <br>  Wait to see if you miss your period and then take a test (or even take one of the early detectors a few days before its expected arrival).<br>  <br>  Full on symptoms vary from gal to gal, but most don't notice much before 6 wks or so.  <br>  <br>  I personally felt implantation (which led me to test and find out I was) and that was at about 5 wks preg.  I had no other symptoms for at least a few weeks and no severe ones until I was a solid 8 to 9 wks.  (Then I threw up for 4.5 months, but that's a whole 'nother story!)  GL|`|AA12105454	Everybody is different... Some women notice a 1 1/2 weeks. Some notice 4 weeks and up.  Dont listen to those people who say you cant notice anything durning the two week wait.|`|5RvTXdmUaa	Nope! Signs only start when you're period is about a week late, more or less.|`|159e15bc29abe3e551d868753b39f233aa	maybe morning sickness.... but nothing else. its too early.
TJ4q7X8Vaa	If you are a 28 day cycle then you should have had a period on february 1 (even though you weren't supposed to). If that is the case you should have ovulated around Feb 15 which would have been when you missed your pills. You're supposed to "have" your next period on March 1. I would wait until then and take a pregnancy test or take one of the early response ones now. If you are worried you may want to stop taking the pill and use condoms until you are sure you aren't pregnant.
CIZjK2rAaa	I took an OPK 4 weeks after my miscarriage to see if I was ovulating and it was positive.  I took another the next day and still positive.  A friend of mine, who is also a nurse, said that if it stayed positive for 3 days in a row that it could possibly be a new pregnancy.  I bought a first response HPT and it too was positive.  I am now 17 weeks and still in shock.|`|b9OaXmmDaa	That is an Ovulation Predictor Kit not pregnancy test
hY5JSbRBaa	A lot of this depends on what state you live in.<br>  For example if you live in Hawaii and adopt a child from their foster care program they pay for almost all of it. And you get fee health care through the state for the first year.<br>  <br>  Of course you can be specific on who you are adopting, to a point.<br>  Although it would be very shallow reason to make that sort of decision on things like skin, hair, or eye color. <br>  <br>  The best thing you should do for this project is google "adoption agencies in your state" or google "adoption laws for your state".<br>  You may even try contacting an adoption attorney to ask some questions. Some may be too busy, but some may be willing to help|`|AA10736763	Here's a link on adopting through the foster care system:<br>  <br>  www.associatedcontent.com/article/9495...|`|dd8cb229ee241de8ca385f84ec4b33d7aa	Every state has different adoption laws<br>  <br>  You can adopted several ways<br>  babies <br>  An agency, you should Google adoption agency and see what comes up<br>  Private adoption, that is normal done by a lawyer<br>  It could be done by people posting on line or on the computer that a couple is looking to adopt, and people that are interested, will call<br>  <br>  Older children<br>  The best way is foster care.  They are tons of children in foster care that can be adopted.  You can look at your state forster care website<br>  There should be information on the web site on how<br>  <br>  Most people that adopted, need to be approved by a social workers<br>  They have to prove they will be fit parents<br>  <br>  Yes a women can adopted<br>  Gay people can adopted, I hear that florida pass a law saying, the law that gay parents could not adopted, was wrong.  I think, then know can adopt in all states, not sure|`|iVcaB9h7aa	There are many forms of adoption.  With foster care adoptions potential parents can make choices about gender, racial background, etc.  Children adopted from foster care can be anywhere from infants to 17.<br>  <br>  With international adoption the children are generally toddlers and older.  International adoption is lengthy and the fees can run upward of $30,000.<br>  <br>  Infants are generally adopted from within your own country through a private attorney or an agency.  Like international adoption the process can take years and the fees are $10,000 - $30,000+.<br>  <br>  Every state has different rules about who can adopt, but generally single people are allowed.<br>  <br>  Take a look at the links below to help you get a feel for what's involved.
e7663cf7226c2b25f5a64eeea04103cfaa	A little bit, but it's nothing to worry about at the moment.  He may just be a small guy when he grows up.  Guys tend to "grow up" slower than girls, and some more than most.   You'll notice a change when he hits puberty :)|`|XdgkK76iaa	Maybe, maybe not. Are you and your husband short, too? If so then there's nothing to worry about. If not that sometimes happens. Or he might have a kind of sickness that prevents him from growing. Ask a doc.|`|JbrJgJGjaa	Is okay to be short, its just the way you are. And I bet you he'll still grow. But, don't worry, I've seen shorter people in high school.

xKSr1ld8aa	Hey you missed out natural parents :)<br>  <br>  I would have moved away from my parents so they and the adoption agency couldn't coerce me into surrendering my son.  There was absolutely no reason for me not to raise him other than they didn't want me to.<br>  <br>  It's okay - btw I'm not anti adoption as children who are abused/neglected should be removed from their parents but mothers who are coerced without doing anything wrong should be supported.|`|sbHJCxWCaa	Since I certainly wasn't consulted in the adoption process, I think the thing I would go back and change is vocalizing my thoughts and feelings about it. I kept so much inside of me and it's only now coming out. I wish I had had the confidence back then, but I can't expect a young child to have the same self actualization that an adult has.|`|hY5JSbRBaa	If I could go back the strong confident woman that I am now, I never would have given my son up for adoption. I would have told anyone who told me I couldn't raise him on my own where to put it. But I wasn't a strong person at the time and listened to everyone telling that it was "best for him".|`|NoUkTQCgaa	Not be relinquished and subsequently adopted??? But, since that's not possible.... <br>  There's really nothing I COULD change about my adoption.<br>   <br>  I would however, change a few things about my reunion. I wouldn't have waited for 22 years for my first Mom to tell my siblings about me. I would have done it myself years ago, instead of waiting for her to be ready. My siblings are extremely hurt she never told them, but we're trying to get through that.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	At the moment I would say no- at the moment.<br>  <br>  But then my kids are young children and we have a lot of years together yet to have good times and times when they might feel sad about things relating to their adoption. And I bet there will be times we might see eye to eye on issues that come up. And lots of times we'll bond closer because of them.<br>  <br>  You know I think every child growing up could find something they would love to change about their parents and the way they handled things at times. (In our case as parents they have more than one set of parents to think about in that area.) I know there are a few things I'd loved to have changed about mine and my own childhood. But in the end I still go home to my mum (my dad passed away) and cuddle her. Tell her I love her and in my heart I forgive her for not being perfect and I love her even more now because of it and focus on all of the wonderful things they did. I know the real shift in that thinking happened when I become a mother... I guess thats why they call it unconditional love. You can be angry and say the worst things one minute and later on you'll forgive them (sometimes it takes longer than a few days) for it and chose to love each other anyway.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you have a great relationship with your kids.|`|in6Iw3BEaa	As an adoptee, I wrestle with that question.  On one hand, it would be great to have been raised by my parents.  On the other hand, I know the life that I lead now is directly related to my adoption.  I'm not saying my life is better, just that I'm happy with it and wouldn't want to lose my husband, family, friends and experiences I've had throughout my life.  I also do wonder about the bad experiences in my life --- would they have happened if I wasn't adopted?  So many what ifs and  could have beens.  Life would just be different, whether good or bad, I'll never know.|`|29f92985b9fb483985c8c89cbc7a99b3aa	The one thing I would change is leaving the possibility of an open adoption..open. <br>  If mom was clean of drugs, even in 4 or 5 years from now, I think it would be very beneficial for my son to have her in his life.<br>  You can not heal a relationship when one person is missing.|`|JP04HX6maa	Yeah...<br>  <br>  I would asked my mother (through my sister, of course) if she ever had the chance to hug me before I was adopted.|`|OQnRP6xVaa	The ONLY thing I would change is to ask a lot more questions about what happened to my children during the time between the removal from their horrible abuse situation and our placement.  <br>  <br>  I would ask many more questions about what kinds of issues, evaluations and services were provided and Hind-sight being 20-20 I would consider it to be a huge red-flag to hear foster families claim our daughter was just perfect and never showed a sign of needing therapy or support...<br>  <br>  That's it!  We would have likely still accepted the placement the fact that nearly a year in a foster home with 8 other children and no one noticed what we did within the first two weeks just makes me sick...<br>  <br>  I mighta also been more alarmed about the police report from a concerned citizen witnessing abuse by the FMom (Foster, not First mom) at the parking lot of the shopping center--but, that was slipped past us at the disclosure meeting and I didn't ask questions...
hw8jOWaeaa	Your not a bad mom, 2 yr olds can be very difficult to entertain and it doesnt help that that is a bad age for kids. Just keep doing what your doing and maybe get some non-toxic finger paint for her or some crafty things. Dont worry, you'll get through it.|`|1tmX7xbRaa	you sound like a good mom don't be so down on yourself. it's not that easy to entertain a 2 year old all the time especially when you have a new born. i am having the same problem with a lack of things to do because it is cold outside. until you either have a way to get around or the new baby gets a little bigger i think you will feel frustrated this way. you are doing the best you can and other then playing with her or trying to take her outside to play (if it's not too cold) then i don't think you should be so hard on yourself.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You are exhausted because you just had a baby not too long ago. It sounds like you are a great mother. You are involving her and that is great. Don't be too hard on yourself.|`|AA10888290	you sound like a great mom!  can you go to a park or out for a walk sometimes? Or even take a trip to the mall and let the older one play.|`|Knierqi9aa	Funny you should ask, I just attended a class that talked about making a shcedule for you and your children to avoid this type of thing. Sounds like you have plenty of things for her to do, you just need to "strongly encourage" her to do them.  For example, when you feed the baby, she have coloring time.  When the baby naps, you two have game/ reading time together.  Come up w/specific activies for her to do during different times of the day.  Make sure she spends plenty of time outsdoors, too, for excesrcise, even if you have to bundle up.  No, your not a bad mom.  Toddlers don't give you many pats on the back, but that doens't mean she is bored.|`|L2Nde54Haa	fun stuff 4 ur toddler 2 do and help u clean the house:put clean white socks on yourself and little miss thang and have a floor polish race...give her a basket and lay out ur veggies at hands reach 4 her and ask her 4 a specific one and have her bring it in the basket to help with lunch or supper!... see where i'm going with this? she'll learn about motion, objects and food items all in good fun, plus help u 2 !!!|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	um try to get her dress up clothes to play in or a kitchen set something new and fun to play with|`|Nz9VHNOIaa	I'm not a mom (yet), but you don' t sound like a horrible mom at all!

Maybe you could get a friend you know very well or Mom who could watch the twins. So you and 2 year old could spend time together. Like zoo, a playground, or go to the mall and take in a movie that she'd like. Take her to church.Do you have siblings who have little ones? If you do take the child to one of them So they could play together. I know it would be hard but you sound like your young and you will make it. They grow fast. Before you know it, you will be watching them graduate. So enjoy them, while you can. Hope I helped. Good luck.|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	Try going for a walk. She might feel left out cause you were her one and only mom and now she has to share you. ESPECIALLY if your breast feeding. She sees that bond. I understand you need to keep up with the house chores BUT think about what is important. Cleaning dishes or watching your child smile. So what if the dishes sit a day longer. Dont stress over it. My mom stressed all the time and the house had to be perfect and we had to entertain ourselfs and help her clean. it was not fun it was a lonely child hood cause we only had our yard to play cause she would not take us to the park and such (we lived on a rd with no children off a busy road) Roll aball with her or excersize with her. Do anything together make cookies and such let her help with dinner or other house chores but make it fun. When laundrey is folded make it like the post office let her sit in the basket and pretend to drive and drop of the cloths on the way.

You're only 3 weeks postpartum: give yourself a break.<br>  <br>  As for your toddler, she's going through a great change, with a new baby... She's probably missing her mama, so make sure you give her lots of attention... At 3 weeks, your baby is fine to snuggle with you, but your toddler needs interaction.<br>  <br>  Do you have any friends or relatives, nearby? Someone who has a toddler, who can play with your daughter? I've been through the baby and toddler (together) thing, two times, as my kids are 11, almost 10, almost 2, and 4 months, and I make sure the older one doesn't feel he/she is being replaced... Good luck!|`|dHREHByPaa	You sound like a fabulous mother. There are mothers all over the world who don't even care that their child might be bored. I think for not having a vehicle and being stuck in the house a lot, you try to occupy them all the time. Kids will have to learn to use their imaginations when they are bored. i have four boys and was in the same boat as you for a long time...I think all you really need to be doing, is what you are already are,considering your circumstances. You will feel better when you are back to work. Good luck to you.|`|lHjXeN8oaa	you are not a horrible or lazy mother - a 2 year old does require a lot more stimulation than a newborn.  the key is to find activities that will catch her attention.  how about playdoh or bubbles?  i even went as far as to bubble paint - i put the bubbles in an ice cube tray and added a drop of food coloring to each cube - then i gave my daughter the bubble wand and a blank piece of paper and showed her to blow toward the paper - when the bubbles hit it and pop, they make an awesome pattern.  I have also filled a cake pan with beans and gave them a plastic shovel and a bowl... the kids played with this forever.  Of course, there is stringing macaroni too.  you could always take a short walk (depending on your climate) to get out of the house for awhile.  then when you got back you could look through magazines for some of the things you saw on your walk (fire hydrants, trees, cars, houses etc.) and glue them to a piece of paper.  I have also taken glasses and filled them with various levels of water and let the kids "play" music on them with spoons.  They have a blast...  There are a lot of ideas --- just get creative.|`|132a94967b26774746922b6b7c03bf49aa	How about some "play dates" with other kids her age? Is the weather nice enough to go to the park where you live?   Was she in daycare before the new baby?  Maybe she misses the excitement and activity of daycare?  I think you are just freaking out -- every minute doesn't need to be a scheduled enrichment activity.  I'm sure she has a world of toys - kids need to learn how to entertain themselves sometimes.  Relax a little.|`|OQXLzV3kaa	You are simply doing your best...having a new baby in addition to a toddler asks for a lot of energy. Don't be so harsh on yourself. Your toddler have some adaptation to do also because of the newborn (she lost her place as the only child, etc..) so she may act different than before. You are not a lazy mom !

yznZqcznaa	It may be too late now but its worth a shot.  I was surprised that we got pregnant when we did because we were trying when I though I ovulated... and then I realized I ovulated late and only had one time where I would have gotten pregnant. Well Im now 11.5 weeks so it just takes one time. Mine was after my EWCM went away too. I just saw it once.  So baby dance and say positive.<br>  <br>  EWCM happens right before you ovulate. So if you saw it today then get to dancing.  Keep in mind it may not have been EWCM if it was the morning after baby dancing that could be left over stuff and you could have ovulated already.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	EWCM usually happens just before and during ovulation. On another not Sperm can live up to 5 days inside the female. So I think you planned just the right time baby dust to you!!!
Jy2RF9Szaa	Yes. Single women may adopt from Russia. <br>  <br>  Here is a good website from the US Department of State that explains the requirements. <a href="http://adoption.state.gov/country/russia.html#how" rel="nofollow">http://adoption.state.gov/country/russia...</a><br>  <br>  You must work through an adoption agency which is accredited by the Russian Government. The US Embassy in Moscow maintains an up-to-date list of accredited agencies on its Web site: <a href="http://moscow.usembassy.gov/adoptions05.html" rel="nofollow">http://moscow.usembassy.gov/adoptions05....</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	yes. It depends who you go through. About a year. it can be up to $60,000. Find an adoption lawyer. They can help you more with your questions. I recommend a city called "Magnitogorsk". Just be careful, look into the medical histories. when they see foreign people wanting to adopt children they sometimes pick the sickest child because they think that the person would be able to pay it's medical bills. So, just watch out for that! Good luck!|`|unt0Z9Pjaa	angelina jolie probably could. money talks.

SlkLCLoDaa	Worst thing ever is my son was about 15 months old. I also have 2 daughters who were about 5 and 3 at the time. Our old house was a very open floor plan and my kids used to enjoy running around in circles through the house. Well, I had warned them about doing his time and time again because I knew someone was going to get hurt. Sure enough, one day my oldest was running as was my 15 month old and they collided. They hit hard enough it caused my 15 month old baby's heart to stop and he just fell over cold. There is nothing worse or more scary than having to do CPR on your own baby. I ended up getting him conscious again before the paramedics arrived but it was the single most scary experience of my life. Needless to say my kids no longer tear thru my home! They are 9,7, and the baby is almost 5 now but he is perfectly fine and has no long lasting effects from the whole ordeal.<br>  <br>  Parenting is such a challenge! Kids are liable to get hurt but as long as you aren't intentionally hurting them, they are liable to get bumps and bruises. Accidents happen!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	what, you want me to write a novel here? i have four kids.  we have had seven emergency room visits for injuries over almost 10 years, and that doesn't even cover the injuries that didn't warrant the er.  for some highlights, one child was hugged by a sibling with nothing but the best of intentions and fell over and split his head open (staples), one kid broke her wrist jumping off a swing, one kid literally just walked into a car door (stitches), one jumped off a bed (dermabond), one fell down a whole flight of stairs (no serious injury except to the parents' psyche, I know how you feel on that one ... it was almost 9 years ago and I can still see it).<br>  <br>  ok, i'm getting stressed out so i'm moving on to the next question.|`|X4O7W1Vvaa	Kid 0-1 Car. 6 weeks in hospital.|`|YkseyT7zaa	Oldest flipped over her handle bars when riding a bike and busted up her lip.<br>  Youngest fell off the arm of the couch and hit her head.

Thank god he only cut his lip a little. I thought it was gonna need stitches but no.|`|AkFag8tNaa	When my oldest was 5 and the youngest was 1, the oldest tried to get him out of his crib by himself and ended up giving him a hairline fracture in his leg (walking cast for 3 wks or so) and when the youngest was around a year, he climbed out of his playpen and fell on a toy (around the eye area) and still has a little scar under his eye. Nothing really serious though, knock on wood!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	There have been a few ... jumping on the bed and whacking into the window frame that was above his bed ... that produced a bloody lip and a bit of a scar in the corner of his mouth. <br>  <br>  One time at my inlaws he was scooting around (more like running, I guess) but wiped out on the area rug (wooden floors underneath) and sailed headlong into the metal door to the garage .. I believe he even left two itty bitty teethmarks on that one! I saw bits of white in his mouth and thought it was tooth, but it was paint chips LOL...he left a huge spot of blood on my shoulder from where I carried him and it came right out in the wash. Two minutes later, he was fine! Go figure. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, forgot about the time dad was with my daughter and she fell down several steps .. just went over the edge like nobody's business and voila! My son came running to me and 'told' on daddy. LOL Five minutes later, she was up and running around like nothing had happened! <br>  <br>  I think sometimes it hurts us more than them. Kids are pretty resilient!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My daughter was just learning to walk and I was on the phone with my mother. My dad had just left and didn't latch the baby gate correctly so she pushed through it and fell down the stairs. I as well only got there in enough time to watch her tumble down them. It was only 5 stairs and they were carpeted. It was still pretty horrible feeling for me. Although by the time I got down the stairs she was sitting up and laughing!!|`|0vLU2GGGaa	my daughter has numerous small accidents over her 5 years of life, there were 2 the most serious.  One was when she was 3, we were staying over at a friend's house, and she tried to open the kitchen tri-folded pantry door (she knows where the goodies are), she wasn't strong enough to pull it open so she shaked it a little, and the whole door came down and hit her.  Her nose were bleeding like crazy, we rushed her to the ER, her nose and face were black and blue for weeks!|`|nYioXmnGaa	My son is also fourteen months old he learned to not pick up a bee or it will sting you  he got stung every where  and very grumpy !! My youngest son learned to  never sit on his brothers little work bench thing  or it might fall over and so will he he  had a huge scrap  across his fore head . And when he was playing with his  walking toy he walked it right off the  porch thank god  he was ok !!!!!!!!|`|8vsPoeMgaa	When my son was a year and a half he stood up in the bath and slipped and hit his mouth on the edge of the bath tub. He hit it so hard that he cut his lip completely threw and had to get 5 stitches. <br>  <br>  He stopped crying before i did :o)|`|t3Zuec0taa	I think the better question would be "what kind of accidents did your children not get into?"|`|e20e778807f334f6575085b3abdf95fcaa	When my older daughter was learning to walk, she stepped on a ball and tumbled face-first on the sharp corner of my MIL coffee table. She was hit in the eye. It swelled up so big and fast that by the short time she fell to the floor and looked up, I thought that her eye ball was knocked out of its socket! <br>  It hadn't, though. The bump was just so huge it looked big enough to be had eyeball and it swelled instantly to that size. <br>  By the time I got her to the hospital, she had stopped crying and was babbling happily. The doctor assured me that her eye was fine, that it was not knocked out of place, and that the bump would go away on its own. It did. <br>  Later, when she was four, she fell on some stone steps and knocked a tooth back a little. <br>  Her little sister once got her tongue stuck to the frozen metal shelf in the freezer. She pulled and ripped her skin off before we could get some warm water to release her. <br>  She was also clunked in the face with a metal vacuum cleaner attachment by a playmate and her lip was cut open.<br>  <br>  Both my kids have survived their younger years. Now I have to live through their teen years!|`|iWrXIWcPaa	my 2 year old has fallen down the stairs 3 or 4 times (my heart stopped each time) she was fine everytime, she would just get distracted and loose her footing. she ran into a couple walls, she will be running forward then turn her head to look at something and hit a wall. she has smashed/pinched her fingers many times closing doors/drawers. and she has whacked her head into the car door twice (waiting foe me to put her her in, she would see something on the ground and bend down for a closer look then when she would bring her head up...) there was also the time at daycare she put a small rock in her mouth and began to choke causing the teaching to have to give her the Heimlich. (she was ok but the teacher was quite shaken!) so far nothing has warranted a trip to the ER or even a call to the dr. hopefully i wont have any horror stories to tell.|`|qayCggxMaa	My kids are only (almost) 4 and (almost) 2, and I'm sure I can't remember everything that's happened to them already.  The worst ones with my daughter have been: rolling off the changing table, climbing a 2' high book shelf and falling off backwards onto her head, and getting her finger caught in the hinges of the heavy glass door at daycare.  For my son they would probably be falling from a standing position on the changing table onto his face (this was at daycare - I don't know what they were thinking) and running in the hallway then tripping so that his forehead hit square on the corner of a doorframe (ER visit for very large lump and sleepiness immediately afterward).|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Once when babysitting I fell down the steps with my 9-month old niece in my arms. Luckily it was only about 4 steps and I was able to grab the back of her head so she wasn't hurt.<br>  <br>  I took her older sister bowling at age 4, and she dropped the ball right on her foot! It took her big toenail off. <br>  <br>  Kids fall. A lot. It's inevitable and you shouldn't feel bad. Just make sure your there to pick him back up, and give him plenty of love after whatever accidents he gets himself into.|`|pT7jrsAgaa	My oldest ones - other than normal bumps and bruises, nothing.

He has rolled off the bed when he was 3 months old ( I swear I only turned my head for 5 seconds!!! lol ) <br>  <br>  Then when he was about 11 months old my husband was changing out the printer cartridges on our printer and didn't notice that my son grabbed the empty-ish one off the desk and played with it, put it in his mouth!! He was a funny shade of blue! ( called poison control and said it wasn't harmful... he would have had to like drink it!)<br>  <br>  And we have had the falling down the stairs thing happen! We were at a beach house for the summer and he was trying to walk down the stairs and he started to slip and I had just put sun screen on him so we were both slippery and I couldn't grab hold!! I felt soooo awful! not to mention there were like 15 people how saw it happen!!<br>  <br>  It happens to everyone!!!! Just be thankful it was nothing serious!!|`|f68cbd69ab1cba1c29f33d69ed58c6b2aa	My daughter is will be 5 March 2nd. She has had one accident that was major enough to go to the ER for stitches. She fell at the bottom of the stairs when she was 3 and cut right above her eye. We had to hold her down for stitches, she cried so hard and kept saying, "Please stop you guys." It was so sad, I cried. And we had to go through it again to have them taken out. Afterwards the nurse told us if we would have went to the other ER in our city they would have numbed her first...yeah thanks for letting me know!!<br>  <br>  Also I have a cut on my eye that is in the same place and they called child services to ask me questions about it!! That was the first time she had ever went to the ER and they did that! I couldn't believe it!

WpGROxH8aa	It might be too early. But you could still take one. If its negative, you should take one again in a couple of weeks to make sure.|`|xreWOKBYaa	Depends on when you are suposts get your period. Some tests work 5 days before you miss your period, others don't. But make sure you use your first morning pee or else it will not work.|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Go ahead and get a good test if you think you're preganant.|`|DutTBV3caa	well it depends on when you should get your period. most tests will work up to 4-5days before you miss it but make sure you're using them right. if you do them too early they may not work.<br>  oh and i recommend doing the test in the morning the first time you go to the bathroom. you dont have to but they work better if you do.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|kT7GVOosaa	it depends on when your period is due. you should be ok to take a test if your period was due already. otherwise wait till the day you were supposed to start and don't start.|`|80A6iHoGaa	have you missed your period?...only take a test after you missed it or get a early detection test and take it a couple days before you should start your period|`|osoTq2dcaa	yea it is ... just wait it out till your period time ... but if you feel more comfortable taking it now then do it .... but even if it is negative i would suggest trying again a few days after your period. <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.|`|AA11542929	if u had sexx and stil havent had ur period then do a test in the morning the night pee wont tell u.. ur highest level of Hcg or something like that will be in the morning..|`|FPsR2xi7aa	Shouldn't be too early.<br>  <br>  Even if you had your period on the 2nd, it's 23 days later.  Since pregnancy tests are good 5 days before your period, you're within that boundy by now (assuming a stable 28 day period anyway).|`|osZ5zVEDaa	I thnk you are good for checking it out. The wife and I have done it as early as two weeks and we were good to check. When in doubt pick up a box and read what it says on the back.|`|joPJtKemaa	You should test 5 days after your missed period for the most accurate results.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	No because if you got pregnant around that time then you would only have to wait two weeks from them...so around the 16th you could test.|`|tQPvv0Glaa	It depends.  When is your period due?|`|ACGJtSARaa	It won't be too early. With the first response pregnancy test you can take it like 3 days after having sex and seeing as how you've waited almost a month you can definitely take the test now.|`|AA11452335	Go buy a pregnancy test and read the back of the box.  You'll need one anyway and if it hasn't been long enough you'll have the PT in hand.|`|vUp7BMtMaa	you can tell after two weeks :)<br>  its been about three weeks so yes try it,and to make sure do it again in about a week or so :)|`|xytNERzlaa	I sorta have the same problem. I have taken about 3 pregnancy test and all came up negative and I'm 5 days late. Let me know if you find something out!|`|Rf65wT1Xaa	i would take a test if i were you. then a week later take another one.|`|8a20c45048431e7cdba59623ee1b83f2aa	They do have early detection tests so maybe use one of those but it really depends when your period is due x|`|GJLjNk5Waa	Most tests show results five days before your missed period.  So, it would depend on when your least cycle was.|`|AA10148408	only the test can tell you the answer, they have early detection ones|`|zEPNwkyyaa	No it won't be too early.|`|yf6phryvaa	Go ahead and it won't hurt.
6nUprmu5aa	You're 13!! And you being in a gang with these people proves your father to be right. If they were safe, responsible older teenagers I might allow my child to "hang out" with them, but in this case, there is no way(if they are good parents) you will convince them. Find friends that are better role models.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	you find better friends who are more your own age, and you DONT join gangs    jeez|`|zgDQrI2uaa	If I were your parent I wouldn't let you hang out with 16-18 year olds either.  There are plenty of 13 year olds sitting in my husband's jail now because they hung out with older kids with maturity issues.  Ever ask yourself why an 18 year old wants to hang out with a middle school kid without a drivers license?  It's because the 18 year old isn't mature enough to hang out with people his own age.  Hon, you need to become mature enough to see that people who are attracted to people much younger for either friendship or romance have maturity issues.  Stick to your own age group.|`|dUgL2DQnaa	YOUR 13<br>  this is why the world is a peice of garbage for people like you in gangs ruining the world<br>  killing people <br>  smoking drugs<br>  sexual dieseases<br>  are all in the daily life of someone in a gang
QveBSjFSaa	Yes..... I often say that I had to bumble around for years before I found my niche, and this is it.<br>  Couldn't be more pleased!|`|ANHsv4ENaa	YES! This is my job, my calling, my life for now. Until he is old enough to be independent and not need mom so much I am here for anything he needs. It's wonderful. My son has just started to really experiment with beginning tantrums and I am so excited. He is growing and learning to express his wants and it just amazes me how this little person used to be just a tiny baby who didn't even crawl. It went so quickly and I loved every moment of it. Even through the diaper change battles I have to smile because this little person is mine and I am doing what I love more than anything, taking care of him.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	I feel that way often.  What an honor to be able to be a mom, huh?|`|7F0zA7ARaa	I don't have any kids, but I work with kids and truly just adore them. I think it's great whenever a mom or dad stays at home with their kid. I understand some families simple can't afford it, but I really just think when it comes down to it that it's whats best for the child. So I don't look down upon you at all. I praise you!|`|WfotGbjNaa	i hate children, theres no fun in it|`|8gnp5Kkjaa	At the risk of sounding, *gasp* old fashioned, I think you are in an ideal situation right now.  There is nothing better for your son than for you to be able to stay home with him now when he needs you most.  Moms are great at that kind of thing.  It's what they were made to do.  You are naturals!  Dads are really great at providing.  It's what men do.  It is part of who we are.  <br>  <br>  Does that mean that women are not capable of working and men are not capable of taking care of the kids?  Certainly not.  But there is no reason you should second guess yourself on this.<br>  <br>  Being a mom is one of the most important jobs in the world.  Too many kids grow up without one.  I would not be the man I am today were it not for my mom.  <br>  <br>  So good on you for wanting to be the best mom you can be.  Your son and future children will thank you for it when they're all grown up.|`|AA10322961	Enjoy this time.  It goes by quickly.  I've been home for going on 11 years.  I am getting restless, but I'm happy my husband and I made the decision for me to stay with the kids.  If I was only a stay at home MOM, life would be eaiser.  I have so much going on with my kids with school, scouts and such, its a bit insane.  But I don't know how parents who both work for $$ do it.|`|O8Yc8He5aa	I am in complete agreement.<br>  My biological children are 11 years old and 1 year old. I am a foster carer and I have worked in many nurseries and schools and am a youth worker for ages 11-19.<br>  <br>  Nothing compares to being a mum.<br>  <br>  The problem is, it is easy to assume that all stay at home mums are lazy layabouts claiming welfare. The reality is, if everything you did day to day as a mum was documented and recorded, you would probably end up being one of the highest paid workers ever, and that doesn't include due to being on call 24 hours, with no holiday time or sick allowances. <br>  When you are a mum, you are a nanny, nurse, cook, cleaner, continence advisor, wardrobe stylist, psychiatrist, counsellor, teacher, physical education provider, chauffer, and countless other things.<br>  Most importantly, you are in charge of the wellbeing of the next generation.
mgiJVjaKaa	There are  a *ton* of resources out there for student parents to help you be a good parent and a good student. Talk to your advisor/counselor about what is available at your particular school. My husband and I are both students as well, and I discovered that there is a daycare on campus with subsidized childcare for students (meaning much cheaper than normal daycare), there are student parent groups who meet to support each other in different ways, there are child health insurance programs that the baby can qualify for if you make less than a certain amount, etc.  There's WIC to help with food, and just so many more resources, including student family housing.<br>  <br>  Money is stressful, yes, but it's stressful for *tons* of new parents, not just students. There are still resources available, you still have supportive families, and there are thousands of students who are going through it just fine (and finishing school on time or nearly on time). No you probably won't have everything new for the baby, tons of gadgets, or the most chic fashions of baby clothes, but you will still be successful as a parent and as a student.<br>  <br>  As for being an adult, that'll come just fine. You're 20 and already an adult, and your family supporting you will just make it that much easier than trying to balance all this on your own.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	Do what u think is right. Just remember if u have the baby it is a lifetime commitment and you need to be able to offer ur child the best life u can. Kids dont ask to be born into terrible situations. There is alot of help out there for unwed pregnant women so you can explore those options as well. In the end it has to be your decision.|`|9P26sacKaa	I'd keep the baby, apply for Medicaid, keep working, and keep going to school.  I'd also apply for financial aid through the school if you don't have it already.  <br>  <br>  I would also talk with my parents and see what they say about it.  After all, if they're willing to continue supporting you and helping you through this, you'll be a lot better off emotionally and financially.<br>  <br>  Other details might need to be worked out as each one comes along, but you would probably qualify for Medicaid if you do not already have health insurance.  <br>  <br>  Kids really don't take that much extra money in the first few years except for healthcare costs, and if you have Medicaid or health insurance, that's not so much of a worry.  If you breastfeed and get family to help with childcare, you don't have extra costs there, and a lot of people will help with supplies and clothes and baby gear.  That's what baby showers are for!<br>  <br>  I'd also start making changes that bring you more responsility and independence, but only within your means.  I wouldn't get into debt so long as I could find another way.  If you need to live with your parents while going to school, then do it.  I wouldn't move in with the guy just because you're pregnant.  You have to think about what's best for all three of you now, and it might mean that the father works his butt off and you live with your parents while you finish school and work and figure things out.  It's not worth going into debt or financial hardship in order to have a place of your own and suddenly live independently.  It's better to do what you can and try to get yourselves into a more stable position one step at a time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|RR7UX4jkaa	Oh, I wish people wouldn't bring up the word abortion on here. But hey, it's a free country right. My wife is pregnant and we both have good jobs. My sisters have kids and no jobs.. and the government paid for all their hospital bills. I'm sorry not our government....US the taxpayers paid for people who are considered poor. They get everything for free. However. My wife and I are expected to pay for everything because we pay taxes and work. Doesn't make sense. But if you don't have money in this economy. Your healthcare will be free. So abortion shouldn't even be an issue. MY OPINION.|`|pjgMW6qaaa	You will make it.<br>  My husband and I made it.<br>  He was the only one working getting 10.25 an hour. We paid $750 for rent plus utilities and other bills.<br>  We had to forget about eating out, cable, internet, and all things that weren't needed.<br>  <br>  Its possible to make it.<br>  <br>  Now I work again to live more comfortable.<br>  Im a caregiver at a group home.<br>  <br>  You got months to have a plan ready.<br>  <br>  Congrats and best wishes|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	You're not the only one who got pregnant in the shitty economy.<br>  Alot of folks got pregnant in the great depression too and those people are just fine now.|`|8mchLCQhaa	Abortion is never the answer.|`|6M2ikJfkaa	If you aren't ready to be a parent, but you don't want an abortion, you could look for an adoption.|`|8EeVtXv9aa	Don't panick, talk to both of your parents about the situation, explain that it wasn't planned nd your scared for both you and the baby, and the worst scenario is an abortion, this is rising lately, you should have both been a little more careful, just because you 2 wern't ready doesnt meen your baby isnt-poor thing. you both need to step up to your mark and make this pregnancy happen and if the worst comes to the worst think about giving it up for adoption but an abortion isnt the solution! i really do things work out for you both, you need to really think about this and next time you know what to do! sorry about the harsh words, but your right the economy is **** at the moment but we need to get through this time and pull through. ive been trying 5months for baby number 1 and it upsets me when people aren't ready for a baby and they still go on to unprotected sex and then when they find out there pregnant they simply have an abortion and kill that innocent life, it hurts people who would wish/dream/prey everyday for a baby. appreciate what you have and help that precious baby grow into a gawjuss, healthy, happy baby :) xxx|`|ca9dEvSAaa	OH honey, I know exactly how you feel!

It will be hard work and guess what your child is worth it. I do not work (seeing as how far along i am) but my husband does. We live with my mom at the moment and it works because we help w/ half of the bills. It is still being responsible. It works out for her cos she doesnt have to pay half the bills and gets to spend it on what ever she wants.<br>  <br>  You can do it and there are ways around this. I am going to school to become a nurse and it is hard and will get harder but guess what it is life. Life is not supposed to be easy.

I thought I was the only one.  I just turned 21 two months ago, I just started living my life, I work full time, and me & my boyfriend of 6 years just found out I'm pregnant.  Last year we broke up & he slept with another girl.  He got HPV from her & I just found out that I have it also.  I'm getting an abortion.  We're working things out, but I don't want to put the baby at risk, and I jsut feel it's unfair to bring a baby into the world without being stable enough to provide for it.  I make $20.00 an hour and that's still not enough to support the child.  It's a tough decisin, but don't let anyone dictate what you do.  My cousin also found out she's pregnant & she's 22 with no job, and her and the baby's father aren't even together, but she's keeping it because her mother is really supportive.  My parents said they will help me, but I made the baby and I don't want to burden anyone with my "responsibility."  Abortion isn't a happy thought, and a lot of people will probably make you feel bad about it, but you do what you have to.   People aren't in your position.  I'm having an abortion because I'm young, and I'm not ready, and I know that I wouldn't be able to provide the kind of life I want for my child.  This is the first time and I was with my boyfriend for 6 years.  Do what you feel is right.|`|Cxdxo393aa	im just had to deal with a similar situation.  im almost 21 and my ex is 25.  just broke up and found out i was pregnant.  i do have a good job and work full time and have my own place but he doesnt.  and it would be really hard for me to do on my own.  but eveything happens for a reason.  this is your child.  plus you dont want to get an abortion without talking to your parents since its part of them too.  you never know they may be totally supportive and make you feel tons better, i know my mom was.  good luck!!|`|ebY6z3VTaa	Why don't you consider adoption? There are so many couples who can't have babies and who would make excellent parents.<br>  <br>  Right now you're responsible for a tiny, helpless little life, and the fate of this baby depends entirely on you.. I think adoption is a very loving choice in the best interest of your baby, if you truly are unable to care for him or her. Please don't end the baby's life, but rather give him or her the best life you possibly can.|`|fbca90d1a5095e661e095b47574cb750aa	I understand how you feel. I am 21 and my fiance is 23 and we are expecting are first, which was unplanned as well. Its def hard and going to be hard to make ends meet and such, but I could never abort my child. Even when I was like you and freaking out about the future. Its good that you are going to school. And it is possible to finish school even with a baby. I'm only taking one semester off and then going back after the baby is born. You may not be able to finish as early as you hoped but just make sure you finish. That way you can get a really good job in the future and support your child even better. If I were you I would talk to your parents and his parents..see how much they are willing to help you. If you decide you want to keep the baby then show them that you are committed to it and to doing the best for the child and yourself. They will be more willing to help and more understanding. And then just work your butt off to make the best life for that child possible. It will all work out in the end. Hope I helped!|`|8WRnqs08aa	Babies are a blessing. You would find a way to accomplish your goals and make ends meet with a baby. You should qualify for FAFSA to help you through school, especially now with a dependent. You have supportive families, so I feel that you should continue your pregnancy. Afterall, you seem like a baby would be a joyous addition to your life.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you!<br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (babies #5&6)|`|AA10747002	WTH - I would be having a baby in 9 months that is what I would do.

Xla2eJveaa	After your period, your egg drops. YOu should have sex around the time your period is ending. once your egg drops it takes 6-10 days for implantation (which is where your ovulation date comes in place). The sperm can attach to your egg but not actually implant to you until you are ovulating. <br>  <br>  This is why the doctors base your "you got pregnant date" by the day of your last period because that's when the sperm and egg most likely first met.<br>  <br>  My point.. don't just have sex around your ovulating date.. have sex even if you're period is still light. <br>  They say to wait 3  days between having sex so the sperm is new and fully developed.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and baby dust|`|DCKOlH13aa	It is possible, but depending on where you are in your cycle right now you should be able to look back yourself to determing if that is accurate. I keep mine online as well as in an excel spreadsheet. Mine tells me sometimes that I ovulated when I know I really didn't. But if your temps went up on CD8 and stayed up the rest of the month then that could be correct, but that would mean you have a 20 day luteal phase.
cP03k3cXaa	Career Goals, tell your students about the occupational outlook handbook and the availablity of career interests testing at any local colleges in your area. Both are very unknown resources that are very valuable to HS students. I always sugest asking the students about their favorite books/websites to visit, sometimes you can find out about things that you never thought about by allowing other people to debut their interests.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	an advice column|`|pp9RzHvDaa	I was on the staff when I was in high school and we had student art that was featured every week.  Also accomplishments and awards by students who were interviewed and a report was done on that.<br>  <br>  This was the school favorite.  We had a section for students who like to show off.  Whoever had tattoos, we took pictures of it and interviewed them and they told what it meant.  Then people who had systems in their car got their pictures taken.  We did a mini who's who.  Like who has the craziest hair.  The key to a good newsletter is to make students stand out.  The more unique the students are and the articles are, the more popular the newsletters will be.  Everyone will want to see what's going to be in it next.|`|CEWIP3AHaa	DEFINITELY get an advice column. Anonymous, obviously, as the advice-giver may get harassed. <br>  A list of dead lines (ex.

For more information, please talk to your guidance counselor)<br>  The top 5 songs in the school would be cool, too. Just poll like 10 students per grade, and then look for the most popular. <br>  And also put a healthy after-school snack, like spring rolls (submerge round rice papers in luke warmer water for a few seconds, and then remove. Add (cooked) shrimp, and shredded lettuce and carrots. Yum!)<br>  You should also profile one student/month. Not nessassarily the most smartest, most athletic, most involved, most popular student, but maybe go hang out in the art room or the band room and find someone interesting. Ask them:<br>  Name:<br>  Grade:<br>  Favourite Teacher:<br>  Favourite Subject:<br>  Why they love their school:<br>  If they could change three things about their school what would they be?<br>  Their favourite assignment so far this year:<br>  Favourite thing to do on the weekend:<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  Hope I helped!|`|Mjni0Np3aa	sometimes we have polls of our favorite things. like movies, tv shows, stores, etc. and there posted in the paper.

Fh4B88ZGaa	If your employer has less than 50 employees, then they are not required by law to hold your job or give you any leave.|`|cuIX13BKaa	It is my understanding that you have 6 weeks of paid disability...did you receive that? I know nothing about your benefit package. It has become finally out of the archaic to allow 6 weeks with is a blister of time to acclimate to everything....the  ladies who spoke before me have a couple of great ideas. Did you get anything in writing perchance? Yes there are laws to protect people from this kind of 'lone star justice' but let's face it....your Boss will most likely try to take the path of least resistance. I don't know what your agreement was when you signed on for the job....or when you went on leave...which of course your boss knew about. The person who was hired...now this is important to find out what your Boss instructed her to as. A permanent employee? Part time with the possibilities of advancement? I hope that if you do not have anything on paper you at least have witnesses. I KNOW you work hard. I also know that in a case like this...the first one with representiation usually wins ~but that is money you have not made yet. See if through a shelter you can find someone to assist you, not even in person...use the hotlines available and find out your rights...as no one is beating your door down to tell you what they are. So many bosses think they are above their promises....that waitresses are a dime a dozen...he mae an agreement with you. i would fight it to see that he either keeps it or compensates you for your time. I am sorry i do NOT know the law of your state...but somehow I do NOT see you losing this one.<br>  <br>  All My Best<br>  <br>  Garbo<br>  <br>  P.S. This is one case inwhich legal Aid as well as the Hospital Spokesperson might as well be able to assist you as in the manner of liason. (Just a thought)~I just saw the answer above me....fight it. I have seen lesser situations come shining through. He made you a promise....The economy was not good 6 weeks ago....what is the difference? Fight it....and meanwhile perhaps look for another job where you will be assured of people keeping their word. From now on..please get things in writing. I know I sound tough...sorry...I just do NOT want to see you hurt in all of this...ther eis entirely too much at stake here. Thanks.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	depends on how many employees the company has.  If it is a small privately owned business (I think it's less than 50 employees) they are not required to keep your job for you while you are on maternity leave.  If you don't get your hours back, you can file for unemployment while you look for another job.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Yes, FMLA is federal legislation that says you have 12 weeks post delivery of your baby to return to your old job without losing it.<br>  <br>  Google FMLA and read up on it... I'm sure there are exemptions for small businesses though... so see if you can find proof that you still have your job, then take that in and show your boss.  If they still fire you, then go to your local court house and bring it up with them.  They'll help direct you.|`|XpQkQassaa	They cant keep the new girl and cut back your hours. However, if the new girl was only temporary and they let her go AND cut back your hours then there is nothing you can do. The only law for this kind of thing is that you can not be fired from your job while on medical leave. They must hold your job for no longer than 12 weeks.|`|eDbgooTdaa	well there is a FMLA law that pretty much says your emplyer has to give your position back or has to pay you! im not sure what state you live in and if its the same for all states but i live in texas. i researched it on the internet and thats what i came up with! so hopefully that works for you and u get your job back!! good luck
AA10888290	I wouldn't mention anything until you really started to show, then let her make another comment.

If I were you, I would have blurted it out right then just to spite her...but I guess that's not very nice : )  Just come out and tell her, and if she has a problem with it, oh well, nothing can be done about it now!

I was soooo mad but she claimed that I should have thought about my older child because now he was gonna have to grow up and so forth but he will be three when his baby brother is here and I think that them having each other will be good!  But she is fine now but man she was a wench when I first found out...|`|gieEWY1Qaa	Parents can be like that, but I do think your mom was kind of rude.

413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	when i had mine, i was less then a month along and it still hurt..it started on and off then went to a none stop horrible pain,it felt like a really bad period cramp. <br>  <br>  and i got up and leaned against a wall and went to the bath room and sat on the toilet and and felt a urgh to push and i did, i felt wet down there so i wiped myself with toilet paper, and i wipe a huge clot about the size of 3 or 4 quarters wide, and after that the pain sorta went away. but i was sore a few days later.. <br>  <br>  i had the pain right above the start of my hair on my vagina .. sorry if its too much information but it was around that area.. it felt like someone was just push on my stomach and it hurt worse than any period cramp i ever had.<br>  <br>  please if it gets worse go to the emergency room. don't wait. if you feel like something is wrong, go to the emergency room.|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	The pain really depends on how far along you are. An early miscarriage is not much more painful than menstrual cramps. I had a miscarriage last month. My baby died at 7 weeks but I miscarried at 11 weeks. The pain was intense labor-like pains. I had contractions that were about 3 minutes apart. It was agonizing pain and then relief in the same area you would feel menstrual cramps. I had no pain at all before my miscarriage started but I did spot brown at the time my peanut died. <br>  <br>  I am thinking positive thoughts for you!|`|O6DSFJbTaa	I remember when I was 8 weeks prego, I thought for sure I was MCing and it turned out to be my appendix.  You could also have a UTI.   Appendix would be constant on the lower right side.  Uti would be in the middle, another constant pain.  Best of luck to you.|`|gxGsqNPPaa	For me, it felt pretty much exactly like painful menstrual cramps. They were located in the same area as menstrual cramps, and were constant like them too. <br>  <br>  Hope everything is ok with you :)|`|61wXpXVxaa	When I misscarried the pain began as on and off, but ended in non-stop pain, I would go and see your doctor and make sure everything is ok, or go to emergency if the pain gets worse. the pain was located in my lower abdomen.|`|VS8mactUaa	Well its vaguely similar to labor, they will come and go, well It did for me, your cervix still had to open during a miscarriage so you do get contractions and they do hurt, I could actually time mine, having someone rub the lower of yur back near tailbone with some force may help to alleviate some pain.|`|aboQfYqeaa	The pain for me happened on and off, like menstrual cramps.  But the very first pain I got, was extremely hard, it made me curl up in my bed. The pain was towards the lower part of my uterus I guess, down towards the cervix.  Well after a while, I felt it through my entire body, but that's where it generated from. At that time I pretty much knew I was loosing the pregnancy.  I kept my hopes up, but you'll know what's going on with your body.  And you just have to understand that as long as you've done everything possible to take care of yourself, it's not your fault, it just happens.<br>  <br>  I hope this is just normal cramping and everything turns out ok.  Take care.
R33f3Ff6aa	I was told to come in and be induced on my due date because due to my sonogram my baby was over 8 pounds and I have a small frame.  My dr. did not want to wait the 2 weeks. Checked in at 8am and within an hour I had iv hooked up, epidural, catheter put in, blood drawn, urine sample taken, dr. broke my water, and the picotin started.   I got a little nauseous from everything happening all at once, but didn't throw up.  The epidural is not that bad...the worst part is the shot they give you to numb the area for the epidural.  And that is over in a few seconds.<br>  <br>  I was already 3cm dilated when they started.  After 2 hours I was dilated to 5cm and then nothing.  For 7 hours no change in dilation at all.  Dr. had no choice but to perform c-section :(.  I was not expecting that at all.  The c-section lasted about 20 minutes and my lil man was here.  <br>  <br>  I think God blessed me with a quick recovery since I had an unexpected labor.  I was up and walking the next morning with little pain(pain meds)and I didn't take any pain meds after they released me 3 days later, just some tylenol once or twice when I over did it.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations and good luck!|`|yB5go5wbaa	Hi, congrats on having your baby soon!  I got induced when I was 2 weeks overdue after having a regular check up.  My doctor scheduled me to go in the next day to have him; I was 2cm dilated and 30% effaced.<br>  <br>  I went in at 11am and checked in and got hooked up to an IV where they started pitocin and antibiotics (I was Group B Strep +).  They increased the dosage of pitocin every 20 minutes, but after 6 hours, the doctor checked me and I was only dilated 3cm and was 40% effaced...after 6 hours!  The doctor said he wanted to break my water and asked if I wanted an epidural...he kind of pushed it on me, but I said that I'd wait until after he broke my water to get one.  He broke my water, and I started having very strong contractions every minute immediately, lasting about a minute.  I asked for an epidural and the anesthesiologist gave me one, but it did not work and I felt everything, because my baby dropped down so quickly.  I went from 3cm to 10cm ready to push in an hour...it went so fast that the doctor was delivering another baby and the nurse told me not to push because she didn't want to deliver the baby by herself.  I could have killed her because I did NOT care - I would have caught the baby myself.  I pushed anyways, because he was right there, and the doctor came in and three pushes later, he was out!<br>  <br>  It was crazy.  I still wouldn't recommend an epidural, even though my contractions hurt so badly.  It was just easy to push when I could feel everything.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I had 45 stitches with a second degree tear because he came so quickly.  I'm almost three weeks PP now, and the first two weeks after was bad - I was really sore and bled a lot.  It's better this week though and I've gotten a lot of energy back.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your little one and congrats again!|`|dXVA1wHDaa	I was induced just before my due date with my son (had PE).  I was 3cm dilated when I went in to be induced.  All the midwife did was firstly break my waters then set up a syntocin drip.  Contractions started around 10 minutes later.  All in all my labour was 5h 45m long, which was fine by me, hehe.<br>  <br>  It was a good labour for being induced, in that the induction worked almost immediately.  Unfortunately my son decided to turn into posterior position, so I had back labour, which wasn't the best.  He turned round eventually though.  The only other thing was I needed an episiotomy, but I had always suspected I would need one.<br>  <br>  <br>  The recovery from the cut wasn't the nicest.  I took arnica and used witch hazel on my maternity pads to help healing.  Salt baths also help, as does using an ice pack.<br>  Good luck!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i was induced at 38weeks due to gd and i would do it all over again. they put cerdavil in the night before around 7 and then broke my water at 830 and started pitocin at 7am. i had the epi by 10 and i delivered at 4:36pm. the only thing that was bad was normal labor stuff of course. like i couldnt engage him and i wasnt pushing right but those can be expected even without being induced. edit: recovery was not bad at all. pretty normal. i tore and it hurt a little bit for about 2 weeks.|`|oeoTZVcfaa	The labor is nothing with the epidural, it's a breeze you don't feel a thing. I had a gorgeous baby girl 2 months ago and it was nothing to have her, but I had the epidural. The epidural doesn't hurt either. I was really scared of the pain of this needle going in my back, but the IV they give you is much worse then the epidural. I had to have a stage 3 episiotomy because my little girl was too big for my body to have without one. The recovery from that was horrible!!!! But once I took a poop (which took 4 days) the pain went away. Not trying to be nasty but there is so much pressure down there and you will definitely be constipated after having her that it will hurt, but other then that it's a breeze! Congratulations. Don't worry, I did so much the day I went in and there was nothing to be worried about! Congratulions again!|`|G6eBvDz8aa	I wasn't technically induced, but there again I was.. <br>  <br>  Wednesday (1/28) I went to the doctors at 8:20am for my weekly.. She did a membrane sweep at that time, as well as checked me for dialation an I was then 2 cm and 75% effaced.. <br>  <br>  Next morning (1/29) I woke up at 7am and felt like I was peeing myself.. Nope.. water broke... Went to hospital around 8pm..<br>   <br>  So it was just kind of nothing interesting till about noon when they checked me and I was only 3 cm dialated and 85% effaced.. so they gave me Pitocin to speed it up.. That SUCKS.. And supposedly it gives you stronger, longer, and harder contractions than if you were to have them normally.. Andy, Steph and I just kind chilled and watched<br>  "Scream" and "Knocked Up" till about.. 4pm.. then my contractions were getting badddddd and I decieded I wanted an epidural.. bad.. So the guy came to give me an epidural.. ha, yeah, funny story about that one..<br>  <br>  They numb your back before they give you the big needle -- well -- he<br>  didn't wait for it to get numb before giving me the big needle.. SO I<br>  felt it all.. felt the needle go in.. it honestly felt like.. grinding?<br>  I don't know it was just disguesting feeling.. But I flinched big time<br>  when he put it in cuz it wasn't numb --- so he said "I think this is in<br>  the right zone but I'll give you some test stuff to see how it does but<br>  if not we can redo it" -- yeah SCREW that! Anyways.. So.. They gave me the medicine cuz I FELT like I was getting numb -- BUT it turns out it was only numbing from my hip to my knee on my RIGHT leg only.. that's IT.. Just my thigh area on my right leg.. So it was like I had a dead leg the whole time.. They put a catheter in then cuz I obviously<br>  couldn't stand.. Which honestly wasn't as bad as I thought.. A nursing student was the one who put it in and his hand was shaking the whole time and I didn't even feel it so he did good!! Then the anestesia guy came in and said he could do the epidural again and I said HELL NO! haha.. <br>  <br>  Anyways.. So around 8pm the contractions were like.. sky high off the chart and I was like, screaming in pain at people, haha, cuz the epidural didn't do anything except that small area of my leg.. so they realized they were giving me too much pitocin (HOW can you not realize you're giving someone TOO MUCH?! WTF!! ) and they cut it back then.. but the contractions were still super strong.. So they gave me stadol.. DO NOT GET THAT.. No matter how much pain you're in.. it makes you feel drunk and I couldn't keep my eyes open.. I was like awake and could hear and talk but I just couldn't keep my eyes open or head up.. but it didn't do anything for the pain.. <br>  <br>  So then around.. 9:45pm the nurse checked me and I was 7cm dialated and 100% effaced and I literally like.. finished dialating in 15 minutes.. And in that 15 minutes the whole time I was like screaming at the nurse that I felt like I had to take a **** and she said whenever I feel that way that I should try to push.. SO about 9:55pm the nurse checked me and was like "Oh my gosh!" and like pushed my button and said get the doctor in here now! and said she could see the head.. and told me to push everytime I felt a contraction.. So then she made Andy and Steph get on each side of my legs and hold them and like push my legs back towards my stomach whenever I had a contraction and had to push.. <br>  <br>  Well 15 minutes later at 10:15pm she was out! I only really pushed<br>  like.. 3 times I think? It was pretty darn easy.. It honestly felt<br>  like.. just burning.. it stung more than anything.. Oh and when pushing I bit my tongue on both sides so I had a super sore tongue for a few days after.. The nurses and doctor said I did amazingly good cuz I pushed and pushed when they told me to and I literally pushed until I was out of breath and stopped breathing then I'd take another breath and push some more! haha.. I tore a little bit so I had to have some stitches but honest to god 3 days after I had her I was feeling completely fine and back to normal.. After she was out they took her over to check her and all of that and my plecenta wasn't coming out so she had to like.. literally put her arm inside me and like, try to get the placenta out.. but it wouldn't come out so she had to use a curette? to get it out which was painful but she said I did better than most people do to get it out.. They also kept giving me pitocin to get more of the blood out, which sucked cuz I had to have small contractions then even after she was out!! I was in the hospital for a day and a half.. Had her Thursday and went home Saturday at 11am.. <br>  <br>  Oh and because of the epidural, my leg in that area was numb<br>  until like.. 12 hours later around 10am on friday morning.. which<br>  sucked.. I even fell one time going to the bathroom with the help of<br>  the nurses cuz I put all my weight on the bad side and I went straight<br>  down.. wasn't as bad as I thought it would be..<br>  during it, it definately was.. but after it it's like ohh no big deal!! ha|`|Qw3lnnrvaa	I was induced a year and a half ago and am getting ready to be induced again... <br>    So I went in early about 7am had a pitocin drip sat around until 12pm which is when my water broke. I agreed to an epidural not because I needed it for pain but simply due to them not being able to check me... After the epidural the labor flew by ( I was not ever in pain, not before or after the water broke) It could be due to the epidural after the water had broken... I got the epidural around 2 I guess and then I started dialating fast my precious baby boy was born at 7 and was 7 pounds 13 ounces. I am rather small and he was too big for me and I had a 4th degree tear... Ripped front to back they stitched me up and I never felt it... I got up got dressed and was the first mother to ever get to participate in giving their son a bath at our hospital... my husband and I enjoyed every moment. I took my medicine at night because the nurse told me to take it so I did not ever hurt so I did... I recovered fast and in less than a month was back in my old clothes...... I am praying the same happens this go around! It was very enjoyable and I am a big baby and that night my hubby and I were deciding if we wanted to go ahead and have another baby soon =) <br>     After coming home there were times I was a little uncomfortable because our bed is so high so getting on and off sometimes caused a little pain but it didn't last.<br>    Well I hope this helps... <br>  God Bless!<br>  Brittany

5HWHPPeiaa	as a mother, it is scary to think of your children alone by themselves... i have a 16 year old and I trust her immensely...so it may not necessarily be a trust issue...mine would be fear...how about asking if a close girlfriend (assuming you are a girl) could stay with you...or even a couple of close girlfriends...you guys could be accountable for each other and take care of little brother...maybe he could even have over a friend...i as a mother would even consider something like that for my own daughter...good luck!|`|hZ7AfJPSaa	Well they might want you and whoever the "we" are to stay over because they would like alone time with each other that parents do need trust me. If you don't understand now you will once you have children.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to go to that persons house you are going to that bad then explain to your parents how you feel, why you feel the way you feel, and tell them that you are willing to do anything if they just let you stay at home. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't just go and do a bunch of stuff and then be told no still by your parents it would be pointless.  Just be sure NOT to get an attitude and remain as pleasant as you can be.|`|vv7LVQpSaa	well your parents are just worried about you so here's what i would do try to prove you can stay in your own house when they're gone or you can tell them that you know they're worried but but you can do it but say it nicely b.c if you don't they'll get mad|`|WB7sFVxAaa	if you haven't already proven yourself to be responsible then there's no way it's gonna happen<br>  <br>  spend the night at a friends house<br>  i'm 15 too and i wouldn't leave a 15 and 9 yo home alone overnight.|`|XdgkK76iaa	Have them trust you and prove that you can do it by staying home alone for a few hours and when they come back have the house all cleaned up and everything.|`|budOTAtgaa	Try and tell them that your old enough to take of youself and you lil brother.. just be like i can take care of myself and you need to try and trust me or something|`|823Z8NH3aa	My Dad always said that it's based on how trustworthy we are. I guess you need to prove yourself trustworthy.|`|54cb91e02a168001f4fb39668687e75baa	you could clean the whole house and maybe they will see if your willing to do that then maybe they can trust you.|`|H2xGrrmmaa	ermm im 13 and i usually just say to my mum that if im not responsible enough to stay the night here on my own then im not responsible to help you clean or whatever like tidy my room hahaaa it works for me : ) best answer ; )|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Well just talk to them. Tell them that if you can't handle it this time then next time you won't even ask. If they say that they can't trust you then tell them "how else are you going to learn to trust me unless you give me this one oppurtunity?" Then don't do anything stupid to betray their trust!|`|sBHhnDwaaa	I'm 20, just had my son, and my mom STILL isn't comfortable with me staying alone in our house!!

I kept getting scared when I was on my own, in a house with an alarm system!|`|G7uLMODKaa	Just try and be nice to them, give handful hints now and then to show how helpful it would be so have him round (I'm not interally sure because I can't understand you that well by your spelling) try doing helpful chores and get them to trust you more, hope this helps :)|`|NIUkYdL2aa	Show them your responsible. Being disrespectful (such as refusing to go) will not make them want to let you stay more.<br>  Gain their trust.<br>  It might take a while unless you use someone else's advice but if not this time they will eventually let you have your own way.|`|AA10888290	Sounds like they don't think you are responsible enough to be alone.  I would show them that you are responsible by doing your chores, doing well in school and treating others with respect.  Just relax...your time will come.|`|AA10747002	They obviously do not trust you. You need to gain their trust first.
ENANtueuaa	Pretty much, except the 24 month is made with a little extra room in the butt for a diaper.|`|VHHis05Naa	Weird that everyone is saying they are, because not at all in my experience!  2T is the step up from 18-24 months.|`|f27c7ae986058c646a62a0a9855a77f3aa	Yes. Sometimes 2T is longer in the pants and 24 months is a little bigger in the bottom. [i think for the diaper or pull-up].|`|p5eodXcSaa	YES!

uaDqpK4Yaa	Sure, beets are a great food for a baby.  I might wait until she is 8 months old because there is some concern about nitrates in beets.  <br>  I hope it goes well,<br>  Carol<br>  check out <a href="http://www.babyfood101.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.babyfood101.com</a> for info on beets|`|KDb96QS7aa	Sure, just be aware it will change her poo color!|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Yes you can.<br>  <br>  There is some concern about nitrates but almost all cases of excess nitrates in babies is from contaminated water, primarily when its used to make infant formula.  To reduce the risks of nitrates, and also overeating and many other issues don't puree the food and let the baby feed herself.<br>  <br>  Of course beets will make the poop red.<br>  <br>  (PS baby food companies say the MONITOR the nitrate levels of their food, they have never said that they don't sell it if its over a certain level. You have to watch their wording)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ecifm.reading.ac.uk/bluebabs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecifm.reading.ac.uk/bluebabs....</a><br>  Blue Baby Syndrome - An illness that begins when large amounts of nitrates in water are ingested by an infant and converted to nitrite by the digestive system. The nitrite then reacts with oxyhemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying blood protein) to form metheglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. If a large enough amount of metheglobin is formed in the blood, body tissues may be deprived of oxygen, causing the infant to develop a blue coloration of their mucous membranes and possibly digestive and respiratory problems. This condition is also known as methemoglobinemia.<br>  <br>  The majority of cases have occurred when nitrate levels have been over 100 mg/litre. However, in many cases bacterial contamination of the water causing gut infections was present or suspected. There have been no cases in the UK since 1972.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/nitratearticle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wholesomebabyfood.com/nitrate...</a><br>  "Because the intake of naturally occurring nitrates from foods such as green beans, carrots, squash, spinach, and beets can be as high as or higher than that from well water, these foods should be avoided before 3 months of age, "<br>  <br>  and "Preventive strategy would be not to introduce home preparations of these vegetables to infants before 3 months of age, although there is no nutritional indication to add complementary foods to the diet of the healthy term infant before 4 to 6 months of age.23 Infants fed commercially prepared infant foods after 3 months of age generally are not at risk of nitrate poisoning, although the containers should be refrigerated after first use and discarded within 24 hours of opening. " American Academy of Pediatrics - Nitrate Statement and<br>  <br>  "Because vegetables, including green beans, carrots, squash, spinach and beets, can have nitrate levels as high or higher than that of well water, infants should not eat these foods until after age 3 months."<br>  AAP Well Water Statement<br>  <br>   <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  What are the odds that my baby will get Blue Baby Syndrome?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  It is important to note that the odds of your baby getting "Blue Baby Syndrome"  nitrate poisoning from Carrots or other veggies is about 0%.   By the time you introduce solid foods to your baby, his tummy should be developed enough to handle "normal" nitrate exposure.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>      "Around the age of three months, an increase in the amount of hydrochloric acid in a baby's stomach kills most of the bacteria that convert nitrate to nitrite. By the time a baby is six months old, its digestive system is fully developed, and none of the nitrate-converting bacteria remain. In older children and adults, nitrate is absorbed and excreted, and Methemoglobinemia is no longer a concern." <a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/b744/b744_2.html" rel="nofollow">http://ohioline.osu.edu/b744/b744_2.html</a><br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Yes, while nitrates are an important issue, they are highly unlikely to poison your baby from the carrots that you make!  Many pediatricians will tell you to not make homemade carrots while many other pediatricians will shrug off Nitrates and tell you there is no issue and no risk. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Nitrate poisoning is very very rare and when it does occur, it is typically traced back to ground water contamination – specifically from contaminated private wells.2

I just purchased the Clearblue Monitor which will tell me when I'm going in to ovulation and when I'm at my peak. I feel more comfortable with this then what you buy at the store. It tells you a little more then those and I was always second guessing if it's positive or not so this way I know for sure. I found mine on Amazon.com make sure it's brand new because it's only made for one person. Good Luck!|`|aeuWwrehaa	Ovarian drilling, done during laparoscopy, is a procedure in which a laser fibre or electrosurgical needle punctures the ovary 4 to 10 times. This treatment results in a dramatic lowering of male hormones within days and is often performed in women who have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Studies have shown that up to 80 percent of patients will benefit from such treatment. Many women who fail to ovulate with clomiphene or Metformin therapy will respond when these medications are reintroduced to the system after ovarian drilling.

I too thought I was having an ectopic pregnancy after researchign online I went to the ER they did an ultrasound and they found a cyst on my left ovary. the pains could be ovulation cramping or period cramping but most likely not an ectopic. just monitor the pain and see if it gets worse if so go to the ER|`|c490676d02a8b133e7a6143969ba0116aa	Could it be that you are ovulating? I have a pain when I ovulate every month. It could also be a cyst. I've had those too and they really pinch! I was just over 5 weeks when we discovered I had an ectopic pregnancy. I was spotting brown but did not have any pain until the day before my surgery to remove my tube. Even then, the pain was just mild pinching. If you do have an ectopic pregnancy, a HPT can pick up hCG. If you have a stick to pee on :) go and do it. If you get a + then go to the ER. <br>  <br>  I wish you luck!
smsUZG4Iaa	* an egg lives 12-24 hours after leaving the ovary<br>  * Normally only one egg is released each time of ovulation<br>  *  Ovulation can be affected by stress, illness or disruption of normal    routines<br>  * Some women may experience some light blood spotting during ovulation<br>  *  Implantation of a fertilized egg normally takes place 6-12 days after ovulation<br>  *  Each woman is born with millions of immature eggs that are awaiting ovulation to begin<br>  *  A menstrual period can occur even if ovulation has not occurred<br>  *  Ovulation can occur even if a menstrual period has not occurred<br>  *  Some women can feel a bit of pain or aching near the ovaries during ovulation called mittelschmerz, which means "middle pain" in German<br>  *  If an egg is not fertilized, it disintegrates and is absorbed into the uterine lining<br>  <br>  so if you ovulated on the 21st. then you still have about 6 days for implantation.. however i hope this helps ya out.. Best of Luck|`|vigFmfLmaa	You should ovulate 14 days before your period.  For women with a 28 day cycle that also mean they ovulate 14 days after their period starts (right in the middle of the cycle).  You should have sex as close to the point you ovulate as possible.

16vwEBiqaa	I have tried...Parents Choice, White Cloud, BJ's Brand, Target Brand, CVS Brand, Pampers and Luvs.<br>  <br>  The cheaper brands were fine for my son until he started moving around. The "wings" just didn't have enough give and would pop open when he started to crawl.<br>  <br>  I recommend Luvs. I have a BJ's Wholesale membership and buy the bulk boxes for 29.99 not including the $5.00 BJ's member coupons.|`|x7vTKP24aa	we hate parents choice, members mark and white cloud. we love the target brand diapers and the wipes are really good too. we use target brand everything, and have never been let down by it.|`|sAbah6dTaa	i'm a very thrifty person, I loved targets brand of diapers, they were awesome, and seemed to fit very very well! =)|`|gWiZAsfBaa	I liked White Cloud. It's only at Wal-Mart though.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	actually i prefer the gdiapers,  but i did use the Walgreen's brand for awhile before switching to gdiapers.  the worked as well as huggies for me. but all baby butts are different so what worked for me may not for you.<br>  <br>  www.gdiapers.com|`|xqp28ETVaa	I personally didn't like Parent's Choice...I thought they were too plasticy. The Target brand is much better quality and also the Kirkland brand if you go to a Costco store.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	Parents Choice or White Cloud from Walmart.  I have used both, they are great and a hell of a lot cheaper than Pampers or Huggies.|`|MhyuXBoEaa	I actually like whitecloud.. they were a combo of luvs and huggies is the best way to describe them. I got them from walmart|`|UAZROoQlaa	I would say Luv's because they are made by the same company that makes Pampers, just cheaper.|`|pXSKSS3daa	I loved Target's brand of diapers before my son started really moving around. They worked well for us from about 3 months to 9.5 months.|`|nuBRcuwvaa	I have used CVS brand, but they're not great... we are buying the pack of diapers at the Family Dollar lately.  They actually work better than CVS brand and cost $7 for 26 diapers.<br>  <br>  You can tell they are cheaper, but they don't leak.  My son is 27 months and in the process of potty training... I think I remember leaking being more of a problem when he was an infant.  But for an older little one, the cheap ones work just fine.
KBirCZGFaa	It sounds to me like you are doing everything exactly right!    I'd like to share with you my recent experience, becaus it sounds very much the same, and I think if you take the time to go the library (or amazon) you wll find some very helpful tips.  <br>  <br>   I just potty-trained my little boy who is 25 months old. I did the training on Feb. 11th at 8:30 a.m. His last accident of the day was at 11:00 am, and by that time, he was going to the potty all by himself when he felt the urge, pulling down his own pants, peeing in the little potty, pulling up his own pants, dumping his urin in the toilet flushing the toilet, and returning the potty bowl to the potty chair. All on his own! He had two more accidents over the next 3 days. Potty Training was on Wed, and his last accidnent was Saturday. It has now been 2 weeks, and he has kept his pants dry in his big boy underwear. I don't even have to remind him! I just sit and read a magazine while he takes care of his own business!<br>  <br>  Do you want to know how this is possible? Get this book: "Toilet-Training in Less Than a Day." I checked it out at the library, read it carefully, took notes, and followed it as closely as I could. All of my friends scoffed, but they were wrong! It worked! <br>  <br>  Overall, the process was exahusting for me because I was giving constant praise and instruction for 4-6 hours. But my son loved it! He got constant attention from his mom, and special treats and drinks. He thought it was a game, and had a lot of fun. <br>  <br>  The reason a lot of moms don't do this is because (a) they haven't heard of it - the potty-traning trend lately is to nearly let kids teach themselves OR (b) it takes too much preperation. To be prepared, you have to read the book carefully, you need to have half-a-day for just this. There should be no other kids around or distractions like toys or TV. It's best to even have snacks and lunch prepared ahead of time. Not every mom can do this, but I could because I stay home and have no other kids. OR (c) if you have tried another method, and the child has experienced failure, this method might not work so well.<br>  <br>  So, how does it work? <br>  I am not going to tell you because I can't write that much here! It's a 100 page book, and if you try to cut corner or wing it from what I say, it won't be done right. But, to give you an idea, it a lot of verbal instruction, manual guidanc with your hands on the child's to help him along, constant praise from the moment the child begins following instruction, special treats for rewards. The doctors who developed the program, used what they know about accelerating the learning process: Learningi s best done with not distractions or interruptions. Learning is best understood through teaching (the child teaches a doll first). Learning is quickly accomplished through lots of practice in a small window of time.<br>  <br>  This was an effective way of potty-training. It was 100% positive and fun for my son. I tell everyone I know.|`|AA10747002	Put her in panties so she can feel the mess.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	put her in underwear and let her feel it....or dont change her diaper when she wants it...i know it sounds disgusting but maybe she will hate the feeling enough to not do it anymore.  My son was kinda like her but I just stopped making him go on the potty.  I kid you not, the next day he just went on his own.  and from there on he was dry and diaper free.  I think its a control issue.  She wants to be in control of the situation.  She will not do what you want...she will do what she wants and when she says she is ready|`|hYXKhaO0aa	try making going to the bathroom fun. Bring a toy to the toilet for her to play with when she pees in the toilet. give her candy when she pees in the toilet. Show her how to pee in the toilet. buy a toy that pees in the toilet. i hope you can make her pee in the toilet. good luck having her pee in the toilet.
5THeZfQhaa	I would tell them that things are getting worse and ask them to please take you to the doctor.|`|IjpcUuWtaa	well if money is low that probably why they haven't taken you...they probably don't want to tell you that thjough so try not to make them feel bad...but if you really need help talk to them.|`|OEATSehSaa	you can talk with your friends about your emotions.just wear off all your emotions|`|Xdk8W2iEaa	You should tell them that u really need to see a dr.  If they dont listen then try to go by yourself.  Do whats best for your health!|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well just go to the doctor urself|`|H2IqzG12aa	Pick up the phone and call the doctor's office yourself and explain your situation.  Or tell a counselor at school what's going on.  Sooner or later, you have to take responsibility for your own well-being, and now sounds like a good time.  If all else fails, call 911.  All hell will break loose but you'll get the attention (medical and otherwise) that you very much need.|`|7mKNHl2zaa	if you cant offerd it then go into a clinic and leave an insurance number|`|3Hf3YtyKaa	when you go to school talk to the guidance counselor- they can send you in the right direction|`|l1STgPyRaa	maybe you should be telling this to them and not us maybe they do not know how hard it is for you right now.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I'm not sure exactly how old you are, but I agree with one of the answers above me. Try talking to a school counselor, or even find a free clinic in your area. You can Google search terms like "free counseling", and see if there are any nearby where you live. I'm 24, and actually on Public Aid due to being a single mom looking for a job, and I know they also cover counseling and medication. I'm taking Lexapro right now for depression, and the public aid (here in IL at least) covers the cost of everything, except for a $2 co-pay at the doctor's office and a $2 co-pay for my prescription every month. If you don't have health insurance, you can apply for public aid in your state at any age. If you are covered on one of your parent's insurance, you can make your own doctor's appointment, as long as you could afford the co-pay for the visit, which is usually around $20 on regular insurance. Good luck!|`|gA22md42aa	um hm emotional issues .... like you will have to take some pills to make you happy ? like prozac?  or some happy pill whatever that is... I'm not familiar.<br>  <br>  Since you know your problem ... could you try to use  reverse psychology ? Usually that's what shrinks do ... and if you could do reverse psychology ... why give the shrink money to do it - plus it eats at your time.  <br>  <br>  You have a step mom.  How do you feel about her? is she nice to you?  Step siblings? do they treat you fairly?  How old are you anyway?  <br>  <br>  Is your biological mother still around?  Could you talk and spend time with her? <br>  <br>  Sorry I don't mean to pry... these are some of the things that get to adolescents.  Part of the growing process I guess.<br>  <br>  This is my growing experience-><br>  <br>  I have been abandoned by my father at age 5 I had a  newborn brother at that time.  I found out that he had a family - a wife, an adopted girl who was about 8 years old and an adopted 8 month old boy.  I couldn't understand why he would prefer to be with a barren wife and children who weren't his own.  I hated him for leaving his real kids.   thought he was a coward.<br>  <br>  My single parent mom had trouble getting a job that could handle a children friendly schedule.  So she often got fired or quit. <br>  We barely had enough for anything but we made do with what we got.  I usually read books and did my homework to pass the time through what was supposed to be dinner time to bed time. Tried not to do much physical activities so I don't get too hungry due to wasted energy.<br>  <br>  Later on I started thinking that there must be something wrong with me for him to not want me.  Then i had a social disorder- inferiority complex (due to poverty/ fatherless/looking like an American in an Asian country) , preferring to be at home than out with kids my same age.  I preferred to not have attachments with people other than my mom and brother.  I didn't have friends.  Maybe I did but I didn't think of them to be.  I started to be so shy that I would cover my face when I walked through a crowd. (Now I see celebrities do that) I later saw a video of me doing that and I thought that I looked so stupid. So I made myself to constantly think that -I have a face not to be ashamed of - it is my face that people will relate to later when thinking of me - I didn't want them to think of a stupid girl covering her face. That cured me- some how along with other things like volunteering, overcoming inferiority by taking public speaking classes.Mind set- I have something important to say and people are all ears to hear it so I must do all I could to make a good speaking impression. I later won awards at inter school competitions.<br>  <br>  I pushed myself to study harder to show my dad that i am better than that girl... smarter. Far more responsible. Even smarter that the other kids who make fun of me just coz I am different.<br>  <br>  I decided that I would rise above my situation and  when I become a grown up I would make better decisions than what both my mom and dad made-- and I did.I used my experiences as a stepping stone and not a stumbling block.<br>  <br>  When I was 16, my brother contacted our dad. Our dad was over joyed.  He sent us gifts after gifts as if to buy missing time. He sent his sister-in-law to go shopping with us. His mother-in-law also came to see us- she hugged us so tightly. She was just happy to see his son-in-laws kids.  I guess in her mind she was thinking we could have been the children her daughter could have had if she could have children. She told us that my father has been spending most of his days at pubs talking about his biological kids and how we might be doing. His life was so miserable. Making his family's life miserable too.<br>  <br>  I also grew up around other kids who have the same/similar life's story their lives turned out very different from mine ... well, my brother turned out different.<br>  <br>  I wonder what would have happened if I saw a shrink or took happy pills... I might have used them like a crutch ... just like the other girl I know.<br>  <br>  Hey, I hope you over come your "issues".
s4LWmcTjaa	Snacks or smacks?<br>  <br>  I give my kids healthy *snacks* all the time.  Diced fruits, veggies, crackers, cheese, all kinds of good eats that are good for you.<br>  <br>  As far as spanking goes, I don't spank personally but I don't have a problem with a parent giving their child a corrective spanking in the proper context.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	okay, i'll give a laugh, since i've seen a couple other questions in your series and noticed your screen name|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Smacking children leads to nothing healthy.

mc6YtaRbaa	This is taken from the paperwork my Dr. gave me on the screening.<br>  <br>  16 week blood test:<br>  1. Picks up about 60% of all babies with Down Syndrome. <br>  2. It is the most well known but is falling out of favor<br>  3. involved testing the maternal blood<br>  4. High false positive rate (the screening test is abnormal but there is nothing wrong with the fetus) Can increase the mother's anxiety.<br>  5. Covered by almost all insurances<br>  <br>  You have to weigh the pros and cons and decide what is best for you. My sister never gets this test done because she says she rather not worry for the rest of the pregnancy and just deal with it when the time comes. My Dr. offers another test that starts at 12 weeks and includes a blood test and an ultra sound and pick up 90% of down syndrome cases and then they do the 16 week test and combine the results from the 12 week with the 16 week for a more accurate result. I'm the type of person who has to know exactly what I am dealing with and prepare for it so I opted to take the test.|`|hoX7hoINaa	I never got the test because my dr said they only give you a ratio. Like a 3 in 100 chance etc. Its not very reliable so I didn't even bother, it just causes you to worry more if a higher number appears.|`|RR7UX4jkaa	It is called an amniocentesis and there is a small risk of M/C. We are choosing not to have it done because we will keep and love whatever god gives us.|`|2N4j1ficaa	hi no blood tests are 100%  but if worried you can have amniocenteses<br>  which is 99 % correct early 20s is not a hi risk  but that dose not mean it wont ... but no its not very accurate<br>  my daughters was hi mine was low i was the one that had a son with down syndrome and my daughter son was a ok so inless you are over worrid and they pick a problem up on scan then no i would not worrie at all hun  afp test are only a  indecator ...... and that is wrong so often ... but dose give the doctors a chance to look in right direction ..|`|YwdsP4c2aa	If you are young and the father is young then you should be low risk for Downs. Scans will show tell-tale signs but obviously not until further on the the pregnancy.  I have heard the blood test can give a false positive - for instance if you are carrying twins. I believe the test looks for HCG levels which are higher with multiple pregnancy and in Downs. I was offered this test with all three of mine - last pregnancy at 35 - I didn't have the test done and they were all fine.  They put a lot of pressure on us don't they!|`|sgMno1PRaa	Hi, I got offered one and thought I might as well because I get to have another scan as well, so I just did it to get the oppurtunity to see our baby again. <br>  If your someone who is going to worry loads then I wouldnt get one, but we decided that even if I was high risk - what would be would be and its better to be prepared then not.|`|758cDKEFaa	i got booked for one but the day of my appointment i couldnt go through it with!<br>  im young myself (im 18) so my chances are 1 in 1555 so its very unlikely but if i was high risk i couldnt risk having that other test that can cause a miscarriage as i dont want to lose my baby but that means if i was high risk i would worry everyday form that point onwards and wouldnt be able to enjoy my pregnancy.|`|yKS2UI87aa	The tests are not near 100%. If you aren't over 35 the only other reason to do it is if Downs runs in your family. My 1st Ob/gyn was insistant I have a amnio. we agreed to do this (non-invasive) and if it came back with bad news I would only then do the amnio. --I did switch Dr's (no one will make me abort my baby) Test was fine. I wouldn't, as it won't change your mind anyhow. You are young and healthy, I would not worry about doing the test.|`|otFCWMuUaa	well you should definetly have one because if you are at risk then they will monitor your pregnancy closer.. its just a blood test where they take an extra tube of blood when you already given them a bunch.. you might as well add one more for safety..age isnt the only determination of down syndrome.<br>  <br>  although if it does come back high risk factor dont be too alarmed caz its mostly just a statistic but still a good idea to have.. most women who have children with down syndrome do test high in the risk factor during pregnancy.|`|zBz10IiOaa	hi no it is not very accurate it is an estimate and that's it my dumb asss dr i had before with my last son said my son had it and i didnt even get the test! and nor would i because i see no reason in worrying about something that is not 100% accurate and i will not do it with this lil boy either but that's my opinion.|`|oMGasIcjaa	Not accurate at all.  A friend of mine was also told her baby had Downs Syndrome, and he was born without it.  Stressful hearing while you are pregnant your child will be born with it for no reason!|`|5ET4mWkzaa	That test caused me a lot of extra test. It came back positive and my son was born without Downs. I would never take it again.|`|wv4hPOuQaa	If you are talking about the AFP test, then yes, it gives many false positives. With my first, the result were that i was at a high risk of having a baby with Down Syndrome....it was wrong. My son is healthy as can be. With my second pregnancy, the result said I am at a high risk for a NTD (Nueral Tube defect)....wrong again. My baby girl is just fine.<br>  <br>  You can take the test if you want...it is not mandatory, just realize that it is only a screening...meaning you "Chances of having problems" is increased, not that there is anything wrong with your baby.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I accepted all test that needed to be done for DS and cystic Fibrosis and all that because I would rather know if I was a risk at all or in the clear completely. None of these problems run in my husband or my family so we aren't too worried about it. BUT I would rather know ahead of time if I'm at high risk so I could prepare myself instead of having the baby and finding out it has one of these problems. I think I would be more stressed out and worried if I found out after it was born versus before.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	It is not accurate at all I 6mo pregnant and I had was going to go have it done, but you would just worry about it your whole pregnancy, and like u said you have enough to worry about already, so i would not get it done, plus you could have it done and it come back that something is wrong and then you have the baby and noting be wrong, so why put yourself through that for 7 more mo.... good luck :)|`|DwTTt628aa	hi its not very accurate i know someone who had it twice and said there was a high risk in both but they turned out fine|`|jGoSU4siaa	hi,<br>  My midwife told me it is 65% accurate while the nt scan in conjunction with the blood test is 90% accurate. Anyway, in terms of 'false' high risk results, I don't see how it can happen! all the test does is calculate your risk of having a Down syndrom's baby. A high risk is anything above a 1 in 250 risk. All those 250 women will be told they are high risk but only one will actually have a Down syndrom baby. The risk factor is just that, a risk factor! Therefore they are NOT FALSE results! You are high risk but your baby is still fine because you still have 249 chances in 250 to have a healthy baby.To get a definite answer,you need an amniosynthesis or CV sampling but since these tests are invasive and carry a 1% rik of miscarriage, it is worth calculating how at risk the baby is in the first place.<br>  I hope this helps. All I would say is, would it change anything if your results came back as high risk? Would you have an amniosynthesis%|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Your reasoning is one of the many reasons I chose not to have it done. What good would the results be anyway?<br>  <br>  As far as I understand it's not extremely accurate on positive or negative results. It's only accurate for a fairly small percentage of women. I'm unsure of exact numbers, I found the same as you.|`|s1utniuvaa	I had it done at 12 weeks... it was no biggie... my dr said that I have a 1 in 1098 chance of having a child with ds and that the average numbers are 1 in 950... I was totally bugging out about having to get it done but it turned out to be no big deal. I got to see my babies and they pricked my finger for the blood... I am now 16 weeks and they are taking blood in 2 weeks and then I just have the normal 20 week scan but the dr said this round of blood work and scans have something to do with spina bifida but they test for that in the ds screening too... So try not to worry... I thought I was going to have a panic attack worrying about it.
FUNhlpiqaa	For me, the braxton contractions felt like the stomach muscles getting tight and then relaxing.  Kind of like if you flex your abs.  They would vary in time from 5 seconds to 30.|`|f4AJHCHKaa	Its hard for me to tell sometimes because she is always pressing against my belly, but for me its hardening of my whole belly, lots of discomfort, but no pain. I hope this helps!! <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats!!|`|xX0zKzw8aa	I get Braxton Hicks every once and a while since 18 weeks.  For me it feels like your uterus is all tightened up, I can feel from the outside how it is tightened, hardened and very round.  I think it feels pretty cool.  It is your whole uterus contracting (tightening) so you can feel the full roundness of your uterus when you have braxton hicks or practice contractions.  Hope that helps|`|61wXpXVxaa	Discomfort but not painful, and when woman walks around, or in time they should stop and not be regular in timing.|`|0SHOXqb4aa	At 31 weeks you are probably getting them.  They feel like a tightening of the abdomen and then a slackening.|`|jkFZb2aYaa	they can feel different for each woman.  they can feel like cramps (like menstrual cramps) or they can feel like a true contraction with tightning in the belly and pain.|`|lBRzCIPQaa	Painless but tightening through your abdomen. Kind of like when your in bed and you loose your breath due to the tightening.
caWdGcvgaa	A warm bath is the only thing I have done that has helped me! =( Unfortunately it is only temporary too!  I know my OBGYN gave me a list of approved medicines that I could take, but the pain hasn't gotten that bad yet! Hopefully it will not!|`|jdRKZe18aa	Baby is on a NERVE right now.  The best you can do is find the right POSITION to aleviate that pain.  For me, it was laying on my back on the floor or a flat harder surface with my knees bent and up on an ottoman or lower chair or stool so that I formed a basic "L" if that makes sense?  That will usually take the pressure off at least temporarily and in a few days or week baby will shift and you should be ok again for a while......|`|Wo4Gxtduaa	yeah i used to know someone who had the same problem<br>  <br>  Backache is very common in pregnancy. Half of all pregnant women can expect some back pain. Your ligaments will become softer and stretch to prepare you for labor. As the baby grows, the hollow in your back may increase and this may cause you backache. Also, due to the increased weight, the muscles in your back may have to work harder to support your balance, resulting in increased lower back pain. About half of all pregnant women complain of backaches. Fortunately, there are lots of simple strategies you can use to ease the pain.<br>  <br>  Tips to Prevent and Treat Backache During Pregnancy<br>  <br>   1. Exercise.  Sticking to an exercise program can solve a lot of your worries. Find out from your doctor what abdominal and back strengthening exercises are safe for you. Also, find out how long you can maintain your regular exercise program.<br>  <br>  Swimming, for example, may be an excellent way to keep fit and relieve the stress on your back from the extra pregnancy weight. Water exercises also invariably work out the trunk muscles, as you use them to balance yourself while floating weightlessly.<br>  <br>  2. Proper Picking up Posture, Girls! You’re walking down the hall when you spot your husband’s toolbox laying on the floor. Stop! Remember, when picking something up from the floor, bend your knees and keep your back straight. Always lift with your legs, never your back, keeping the heavy object close to your body at all times.<br>  <br>  You can also try kneeling down on one knee with the other foot flat on the floor. Get as close to the renegade object as you can.<br>  <br>  3. Don’t Be A Sitting Duck. Improper sitting positions will make you an easy target for back pain. Be sure to sit with your back straight and well supported. When you are seated, tuck a small, firm cushion in the small of your back. It will give you support and help relieve the aches you experience after you have been sitting for a while. Make sure that your chair has a straight back, arms and firm cushions.<br>  <br>  When sitting, try not to cross your legs. This can aggravate your back pain and compromise the circulation in your extremities.<br>  <br>  4. Showing Style. High-heeled shoes are so before-you-were-pregnant. Word to the fashionista: because of the extra weight you’re carrying, you’ll want to pack away uncomfortable footwear. Think flat, simple and comfortable.<br>  <br>  5. Sleeping Arrangements. A firm mattress will help relieve your back pain. If you don’t have a firm mattress, put a piece of hardboard under your current mattress.<br>  <br>  Lying on your back puts 55 lbs. of pressure on your back. Placing a pillow under your knees cuts the pressure in half. Lying on your side with a pillow between your knees also reduces the pressure.<br>  <br>  6. A Pillow is the Answer. Try a pregnancy pillow (see photos below). These popular full-body pillows provide great support for your head, shoulders, abdomen and legs. They promote healthier circulation and can reduce head, neck and back pain. These special pillows soothe aching muscles and also ensure proper spinal alignment. After the arrival of your baby, lie back and use it as a nursing pillow.<br>  <br>  7. Wear a Support Belt. A pregnancy support belt gently lifts the abdomen without squeezing and encourages a more erect posture. Proven to be safe, these popular belts can dramatically reduce or even eliminate lower back pain caused by the strains of pregnancy. These belts are comfortable and fully adjustable.<br>  <br>  8. Pamper Yourself. While a birthday lets you be "Queen of the Day," pregnancy means people will tolerate you lavishing yourself with tender loving care for a whole nine months. Pampering yourself, even if it’s just getting more rest, can mean reduced back pain.<br>  <br>  Ask your partner or a friend to massage your back — remember though that some aromatherapy oils can be dangerous for the baby. Instead, use baby oil to rub your aches away. Also, make sure you get enough rest, especially later on in your pregnancy. Lastly, try not to stand for long periods of time. If you have to, keep one foot up on a stool with your knee bent to prevent strain on your lower back.<br>  <br>  9. About Weight Gain. Don’t gain more than the recommended amount of weight. Nine months of carrying extra weight gain will take its toll on your back. If you’re already a bit over the suggested gain, be sure to make up for it with added rest.|`|AA11783671	Could just be the way the baby is sitting and the fact that you are having to adapt to your baby and growing belly.  Also could be an issue with the sciatic nerve.  You can try being on all fours and letting your baby hang.  This will take stress of your back if it's the baby putting pressure on you.  If you've pulled something, this won't help.  Give it a try and see what happens.|`|Nj0SuF09aa	take pain pills.... or use a heating pad.<br>  or just use icy then hot
ujGq2YcHaa	Dark red to black vaginal blood is simply old blood.  It's been in there longer than your normal menstrual blood, so the color reflects that. <br>  <br>  Yes, around 2 1/2 months after delivery you should expect a period. This is still blood from the birth that your body is clearing out.  You may bleed on and off for a few months after a baby.  It isn't anything to worry about.  :)|`|jHH3G56Jaa	It's normal.<br>  even though you are breastfeeding you still can have periods.<br>  Breastfeeding is not a form of birth control.|`|9QVjNaIPaa	just because you are breastfeeding doesn't mean you automatically dont get your period. if you are clotting or going through more than one pad in an hour then you should call your doc. otherwise, it probably is your period (they tend to be really bad after birth) and i wouldn't worry.|`|YR9h8p77aa	Everyone is different and you can have your period even while breastfeeding.  It's an old wives tale that you can't get pregnant again while breastfeeding too.  Besides, you've just had a baby...your body can still be in a readjustment phase and your body is expelling extra stuff.  If you are really concerned, you should get in touch with your doctor...that's why they get paid the big bucks.|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	for your information everybody is different and yes u do usually get ur period while breastfeeding. ur body is healing and cleaning itself, some women bleed for 2 months after giving birth. if u r really worried about this u should b calling a dr.|`|AA11606178	You should see your primary Dr. You can call them and explain they will tell you if you should go in. Good luck!

9P26sacKaa	No, a fever is a sign of infection or illness.  If you have a fever and you are near your due date, or any time you have a fever about 100 in pregnancy, you need to call your doctor.<br>  <br>  Signs of labor include contractions that take your attention and are getting longer, stronger, and closer together or your waters breaking.  Those are definite signs of labor.  There are signs that labor may be starting soon, including infrequent contractions, losing your mucus plug, baby dropping into your pelvis (you can breath easier but have to pee all the time), nesting (sudden burst of energy and feeling like you need to prepare your nest for the new baby), and you might have slight flu symptoms like diarrhea and nausea WITHOUT fever.<br>  <br>  A fever could be a sign of an infection, which needs to be looked at right away, and if your temperature gets too high, it can be bad for the baby.  So, if you are near your due date or have a fever above 100 degrees, you need to call your doctor or midwife.<br>  <br>  Being almost 9 months, I would call the doctor/midwife to tell them you have a fever.|`|413b4fb0c6135de1977fbe2828766a1baa	well i'm sorry your alone in what to expect... here is some information for you to read and the link to the website so you can read more.. But a Fever means a infection.. thats very serious please call your doctor and see some care very soon.. it could mean a UTI(urinary tract infection) or worse..<br>  <br>  i hope everything goes well for you.. your younger(i'm 19) and your already a mother, its gift so i hope you enjoy every moment of it.. and good luck..   :D)<br>  <br>  <br>  Some of these signs of labor include: <br>  <br>  <br>  A sudden burst of energy or the "nesting instinct" <br>  Lightening or Dropping of the baby (you may be able to breathe easier and urinate more) <br>  An upset stomach <br>  Diarrhea <br>  Bloody show (this may be the cervix beginning to open, or from sex or a vaginal exam) <br>  Loss of your mucous plug (may come out in a chunk or you may just notice it slowly over a couple of days) <br>  Weight loss <br>  Slight increase in blood pressure <br>  Increase in practice contractions (Braxton Hicks Contractions)<br>  <br>  <br>  Before the onset of labor your body will give you signs that full blown labor is about to begin.<br>  <br>  Another labor sign is the release of the mucous plug. As the cervix begins to dilate or open up, mucous will be discharged. It may be tinged with blood or be pinkish in color. If you notice any bright red discharge call your health care provider immediately! You could be bleeding which can be a life threatening condition. <br>  <br>  Just before labor begins you may experience "nesting" or a sudden urge to clean with a burst of energy. <br>  <br>  All of the above conditions can occur days or weeks before labor and indicate that labor is imminent. <br>  <br>  Your membranes may rupture or water break. When this happens you may feel a gush of fluid coming from your vagina. Call your health care provider immediately. You are in true labor. You'll need to be monitored as infection can set in causing danger to your baby. If you think you are too early to deliver it will be too late to stop the labor. Labor contractions will increase in frequency and pain after the rupture of the amniotic sac. With most women this does not occur until they are about to deliver. If the water does break, a physician may need to induce if labor goes too long due to infection that can set in.|`|AA10468184	No, but could be a sign of an infection.  What is your temperature?  Any cramping, bleeding, loss of fluid?<br>  Edit:<br>  Get a hold of your doctor.  They'll want to know what your temp is and how long you've had it.  They'll want you to stay really hydrated: that's several large glasses of water a day (at least decaffinated fluids).|`|8EeVtXv9aa	My friend experienced this funny enough and she was complaining she suddenyl had a sore throat and felt chilly and before we knew it the baby had moved and she was ready to go into labour, but you could just be coming down with something. all the best hun xxx|`|AA11538461	No, actually your temperature shoud drop to pre-pregnancy levels.|`|QxJ4tuUCaa	When my sister had a fever 1 week before she was due, she had an infection, and had to have an emergency c-section. So a fever can be bad news. Then her daughter got meningitis which could be from strep b which could of been her infection. Not positive though.|`|8RfmosODaa	I dont think it is. I think you wanna be careful if you have a fever in pregnancy. Call your doctor.
6qCnpxrNaa	Pick a "soothing song".  That's what I was told to do and every time he gets upset sing that particular song to him but only sing it when he's upset.  It's worked for me so far but then again my son is just under two weeks old so I've got a way to go to get to 8 months.  But my boy doesn't like changing or dressing either or even a slight sponge bath but oh well, it has to be done!  Good Luck!|`|qjDxKXENaa	my daughter likes her brush. you could try the same or something colourfull.|`|1S7uXsInaa	Sounds about right.  He is probably mobile now and does not wants to be tied down.  When my daughter was able to fit in Pull-Ups that is what we used, except at bed time.  That was much easier for us, quick changes.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	lol,my 7 month old does the same, though he just mostly tries to roll over and crawl off.  what works for me is when i take his pants off, just playfully toss them over his face, he grabs them and tries to pull them off, but if i try to take them, it becomes a game and he won't let go.  so as i change his diaper, i just tug on them every so often and that keeps him occupied until i go to put them back on... lol|`|9QVjNaIPaa	my son is 11 months and is just as bad! he gives us such a hard time but all we have been able to do is double team him as well. i dont remember my daughter being this bad so maybe its just boys lol! hopefully he grows out of it soon!|`|mldo1vxYaa	Try ignoring him when he screams like that, if you dont give him attention he will stop doing it, or everytime he does it just say a firm no.|`|S8AKs5s6aa	idk, some kids just dont like it. from my babysitting experience ( i know im a prow :P) sometimes the only way to get them to calm down is to associate the diaper/cloth changing time with something good. Like give him some food he likes while your doing it, then he looks forward to it.<br>  he may never grow out of it tho. I know some children just dont like it <br>  but if you put it in a sort of positive light, then it might get better, I know that babies turn to there parents to see what attitude to have, if you dread doing it, then he might pick up on the negative energy and hates it too, so just be all smiles lol<br>  <br>  hope it helped :/|`|1Hq4vC8Jaa	My son just turned 9 months and was doing the same thing. I tried the firm no's and the toy and nothing seemed to work then I tried singing to him and it worked. The one that seems to work best is the hokey-pok with my own little spin. You sing the arms and the head and legs normally but when it comes to the ".....you do the hokey-pokey and you turn yourself about...." part, I changed it to  "....you put the clothes on and get ready to (start our day,go to bed, go for a walk, go for a ride, go shopping, etc. You just put in whatever it is your getting dressed for ) and that's what it's all about."   For diaper changes try and make up a song about changing it. I used a song my mother used for my baby sister. Hers has poo poo in the panties wipe it out (clack your tongue 2 x's) hers has poo poo in the panties wipe it out ( clack your tongue 2 x's) hers has poo poo in the panties and it smells like old banannies her has poo poo in the panties wipe it out (clack your tongue 2 x's) lol. These seemed to help me and I know my mom wouldn't mind you using her ultra cool diaper song so feel free to try it. Hope this helps.|`|aqUgKtmeaa	Get one of those little mesh things that you can put fruit or something in. It has a handle on it so he can hold it. Throw in some frozen banana slices or grapes and let him gnaw away at it to distract him while you change his butt. Eventually, he'll calm down.
w0eRRsoVaa	Hun, on top of the emotional overload and the hormones, you had people every which place and no, you shouldn't feel bad.  I've known breastfed kids that have bad health problems and bottle fed kids without.  While I realize the breastfeeding nazi's of america try to make non-breastfeeding moms feel bad, you do what's right by you and your kids.  You tried your best and no one can spite you for that.  They got the most important source of breastmilk in that first few days.|`|uMIvRRjoaa	This is totally meant to be helpful- now that you're able to go up and down, why not pump while you're feeding your boy and bottle feed that to your daughter? If you're feeling so bad, and still producing, try to do something about it, kwim? If you're only 4 wks pp, you can likely still do both. Otherwise, you just have to recognize that you did what you could handle. *shrug* Being the stubborn b*tch that I am though I'd work on trying making it work now. lol|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I hate to ask this - but do you spend a lot of time on YA?<br>  Because this could make everyone feel bad about everything they do, unless you really are the mythical (and non-existant) Supermum.<br>  Hormones don't help, perhaps a little of the baby blues, but you really shouldn't feel bad - it sounds like you have enough to be dealing with!<br>  You are not failing your kids - as long as you're not starving or beating them, you're NOT failing them!|`|E5CnUdhsaa	please dont feel bad....ok we all know that breast is best in my opinion that goes out the window when you have to do whats working best for your child and you! my daughter woul not latch period. my nipples were blistered and bleeding and she was hungry all the time im talking wanting fed every five mins which left no time to pump then my milk dried....as it went i still was too stubborn to give in because i was terrified of feeling like a failure. it got to the point where i would cry because i had to feed her which is when i sterelised some bottle and i never looked back! look at your babies...are they happy? are they thriving? are they satisfied? then you should be one proud mum because it you that made that happen.....not your breast not the bottle...your desicion to do whats best for baby:)|`|bHCssC0zaa	I am in same situation since my son is 19 months now,it was my first child and did not knew so much and no one was around for any help.<br>  i wanted to breastfeed,but my son used to start crying,,he used to suck for 2-3 seconds and then starts crying,it was not there was no milk,,but it was alot.rather i was in so much pain due to milk kept flowing.<br>  i used to take out,more i use, more milk was coming.but my son did not want to drink,and i was getting worried hae is hungry and used to give him bottle.<br>  i still feel bad i did not worked hard,moreover despite of vaginal birth i had number of stitched and i took 2 weeks to recover,i was in labor 18-20 hours and may be that was reason i was not feeing very healthy to struggle with baby making him feed from breast.<br>  but i still repent on that...|`|uQlD1Zffaa	Yes, the hormones have probably taken over here. It's hard to decide to give up but sometimes your choices are limited especially with twins! Sheesh. My first I had an unexpected c-section and I tried so hard to breast feed but the pain of the c-section and the fact that he wouldn't latch on was too much for me. With my daughter, I had to have a repeat c-section since they were so close. I opted to not even try, needless to say I'm over it and kids are healthy and happy! You will be fine, don't feel bad at all!|`|deIzFnV8aa	Be proud that you made it as far as  you did under the circumstances. It shows how much you love your babies that you pumped for so long - it is so much harder than feeding from the breast! People choose breast vs bottle for all kinds of reasons, and being a great mom is not about which you choose.|`|JRXpYW3Naa	Hey, you tried, thats all that can be asked of you.|`|AA11065140	Oh, golly, you shouldn't feel guilty.  It's entirely a personal decision, and there are tons of people out there who have done just fine on formula.  In fact, there's a whole generation of us who never tasted breast milk!<br>  <br>  You're not failing your kids...you're feeding them when they're hungry, right?  That's what's most important.<br>  <br>  And yes, there are literally thousands of women who want to breastfeed, but for various reasons can't...I can promise you that they feel (or at least felt) bad about it, but recognize that it's simply reality.<br>  <br>  Absolutely, your strong feelings could be (at least partially) based on hormonal changes.  As your body starts to normalize, and as you see both of them growing and being healthy, your concerns will dissipate.  <br>  <br>  This is one of many things about parenting that will make you question whether you're doing right or wrong.  In parenting, and in life, we have to make decisions, and be comfortable moving forward with them.  Don't second-guess yourself!|`|CsnIpuNvaa	I left like this but got over it quickly.  I know I did what was best and so did you.  My son was in the NICU for three and a half weeks.  I had to pump the whole time because they would not let me breastfeed him.  Even though I pumped, they still had to supplement with formula.  When he came home, not only did I have to feed him every two hours, but I also had to pump!  (I could only pump because we couldn't learn how to breastfeed at that point and if he tried sucking he wouldn't get anything unless I pumped.)  That was not possible to do around the clock.  Then when I returned to work I pumped for only a few days.  My supply ran out because when I got home I had to take care of my son.  I thought about "relactating" but it's in the best interest of me, my husband and my son to take care of the family rather than pumping and getting a few drops.  He is now five months, has never been sick yet - Thank God -, keeps gaining weight and is happy.  He gets his nutrients.  The breastmilk he had in the beginning must have helped too.  <br>  <br>  So don't feel bad.  When you do a cost-benefit analysis, you made the best choice.|`|xreWOKBYaa	No worries little lady! I chose not to breastfeed any of my 4 children and they are all older and happy and healthy!<br>  <br>  Once you see that your baby is just fine without it, you will realize there is nothing to feel bad about!

VS8mactUaa	Yes you should and you should also consider speaking to a doctor about this there are many things that could be involved, she may be sexually active, she may have been touched, as well OCD is a disease that had a lot of control over people, and suprisingly it is very common for it to manifest itself in sexually related ways, verbally physically and all form, from her being very interested to her not being able to help the fact that she feels she needs to do these things.<br>  <br>  She is not a troll, she emailed me curious about OCD, did you ever think that it started happening and she was confused and just signed up here to get help, we all signed up here someday for the first time.

He should re-insure her that he still loves her as a daughter.<br>  Don't let him know that you are grossed out.|`|BILIAKSOaa	I would definitely talk to someone about this. This isn't write. I would like recommend going to see a physiologist. Maybe they can help your her with the feelings she is having with her dad, but don't back away from her. Like you need to be there for her and support her because if she goes to a physiologist she needs someone to lean on. You should talk to her first and then decide to see a physiologist. Hope I helped & good luck. (:|`|auUeI2Vnaa	I don't know if I would tell him.  One part of me says, YES, tell him!!  Then another part of me wonders if she has been sexual abused and if he may have had anything to do with it...<br>  <br>  I would definitely be concerned....|`|X6as2nOAaa	I think you need to get a lock on the door and talk to your bf.|`|T8ksKCWCaa	She is curious, so you and the boyfriend need to have a talk with her about privacy, and inappropriate behavior. She is probably used to being the woman in her dads life. So you two need to set some boundaries right away.|`|dcd11iUwaa	shes just at that age where shes curious and hes been the only man in her life for so long that any questions about sexuality are directly related to her.<br>  You need to tell you boyfriend, but in a calm way and explain that you understand what shes going through and maybe he needs to have a talk with her about sex and the appropriate behavior between a father and daughter.|`|jAPBNtMKaa	That's bit weird but it might be just a phase. She might be hearing about sex stuff from her friends at school and not have any other outlet for her curiosity. I think the best thing to do is have the talk or if it has already been had, have it again.|`|mZlPj8Guaa	Sounds like daughter has competition. And also curious. Remember, before you entered the picture, she was the woman of the house. Now dad has a new friend. Talk to your BF. Show your concerns. And see if he can talk to his daughter.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	She's being protective of her father and is trying to make you uncomfortable and it seems to be working!|`|1XCFEmp4aa	ooooo ya you gotta tell him.|`|IYLlupdkaa	yeah well thats pretty... weird.|`|7wkHVaNyaa	I think you should sit her down and explain to her that you and her dad are a couple and as a couple you are affectionate with each other. Then go into how it is inappropriate for her at her age to pay so much attention to both of your affection. <br>  So the bottom line is that she is used to being daddy's girl. She is 10, she doesn't understand all the new roles going on. She is maybe curious about why he is affectionate with you like that and at the same time getting curious about sexuality. I don't think it means she wants her father, I think he is the only comfortable male to her and subconsciously she is having a hard time dealing with the new living arrangement. She is afraid to loose his affection. Don't make her feel shame. You need to be as understanding as possible and not embarrass her. I think if it gets worse or continues then maybe tell your bf, but this is his daughter and he will defend. Also you don't want to have her hating you. You need to work it out and also make her feel comfortable coming to you about stuff.|`|UADLdXBtaa	She's curious about sex. It sounds like she never played "I'll show you mine if you show me yours" with a little friend. Since she's only ten, I wouldn't bring it up with her just yet but you could let him know what's going on so he is extra careful around her (locking the door when he's in the bathroom, not sleeping naked, etc). You don't want to embarrass her with a talk none of you are quite ready for. It should definitely be on the agenda for the tween birds and bees talk (when she's 12 or 13). Until then, try to save the pda's for when she's not around. Please don't embarrass her by making her see a doctor or therapist. She doesn't need one. She has a natural curiosity about certain things that she may have heard about. Every kid goes through this phase, most are not usually as vocal or obvious about their curiosities, but it is the same thing. Ask her if she has questions and answer them as lightly and truthfully (maybe not the whole truth) as possible.|`|69xsyP7faa	Yes!! you should definitely ask him about it....why would a ten year old be interested in that sort of thing without having a prior encounter or prior knowledge about it....it may not be anything but you should make sure...especially if you feel awkward...dont let it swell....follow your instinct.|`|IjpcUuWtaa	well you should definatly talk to him about it...but remember its his daughter and he is probobly gana deny it...also if her moms not in the picture she probably needs a girl to talk about things with...so don't make her uncomfortable around you.|`|2ZrQXTfEaa	uh yes of course. she seems to be way to mature for her age. and if she is going to act of a higher age....she should be treated like an older kid. that goes for punishments. she should not know these kind of thing at her age.|`|C4lwDCkLaa	I would definetly address this situation before it goes to far.

ITn1W6iFaa	You are likely to get pregnant only 2 days a month, so first of all that's like a 1/15 chance you had sex at a time when it was even possible. You are also on the pill and he pulled out. I know that antibiotics can make the pill less effective but Plan B works in the first 72 hours so you really have nothing to worry about. You're not pregnant so just put your mind at ease. If you continue to worry about it, wait another 2 weeks and take a test, when it comes up negative you'll feel a lot better. :o)|`|qMVOV9t4aa	Congratulations your pregnant!|`|jkFZb2aYaa	sounds like you are worrying too much.  you have too many odds in your favor that you are NOT pregnant.  the pill is less effective when taking antibiotics, howevever Plan B should have worked if you had conceived.  I wouldn't worry about it.  If you end up being late for your period, take a test, but I doubt you are pregnant with the facts you have shared.

Rather than trying to figure out how to get her to sleep through the night you could try to figure out ways for her to help herself fall asleep at night with out nursing.  Honestly, most toddlers wake several times a night.  The ones that "sleep through the night" stay in a semi-sleepy state, roll over, reposition, and fall back asleep, so it just seems like they're sleeping through the night.  They don't just fall asleep and stay asleep all night long.<br>  <br>  Some people will say that babies want to fall asleep during the night the same way they do at bedtime, others will disagree and say that as long as you handle each night waking the same, even if it is different from bedtime, it's okay.  I honestly don't know which is better.  <br>  <br>  But, you could try pushing her sleepy time nursing up a bit and trying something else to have her fall asleep at night.  Maybe you singing her lullabies, maybe some white noise, maybe some music, maybe some lights (like a crib projector), or whatever.

d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	You're kinda early for labor honey but if you suspect that your water has broken you should call your Dr right away. If this is your 1st pregnancy i can understand the anxiety, but even tough you are miserable, your little bun in the oven still should bake for a few more weeks, after 36 is better for your baby. I know how hard it can be, i'm there! but try to calm yourself and wait. The real contractions will get stronger and won't let up if you change positions, the discharge could be your mucus plug. Hang in there, it's almost over, before you know it you'll be holding your little one in your arms.|`|ck5edW9kaa	Walk around pretty much non stop for a day and then have sex.

IoWoDxG8aa	I have had the same thing. I have been spotting for about two and a half weeks now. I called the doc and she told me unless it is heavy with bright red blood and clotting with cramps not to worry. If you have any of that, you should go to the ER. Most of mine is extremely light...a few drops throughout the whole day and then a few days it got heavier but not heavy enough to really fill a pantyliner. And it got brick red. I don't think anything is wrong because my preggo symptoms have gotten worse. I've heard that miscarriages, when they spot, they start to bleed heavy like two days later and then pass the baby. I wouldn't worry too much but if you are having a slightly heavier flow, try to sit or lay down and relax. I've learned that my flow gets slightly heavier when I am doing housework. So it may mean you need some rest.|`|AA10147946	I'm 11 weeks 2 days now with what appears (from all ultrasounds, etc) to be a normal, healthy pregnancy.<br>  <br>  I was 8 weeks pregnant before I realized it because I thought I was getting my "period".  I had a very "light period" (heavyish at times) for about ten days when I was 4 weeks gone.  <br>  <br>  I've also been spotting every now and then since, every couple days, not a whole lot, but a few drops on a pantiliner and some when I wipe occasionally.  But everything looks normal, I've actually had three ultrasounds so far (I have a really good doctor, they weren't taking any chances since I miscarried in july).<br>  <br>  I also think that you may need to take it easy, as the first answerer said.  Don't stress about it, that could cause some harmless bleeding to BECOME a miscarriage.  <br>  <br>  Congratulations!
vigFmfLmaa	Normally the ovulation twinge or pinch is felt once, just like ovulation it only occurs once.  What you are feeling is the ovulation - the follicle actually rupturing and the egg being released.  You may feel other cramps from the follicles getting larger or even pain/tenderness after ovulation (which is not as common).  For this reason cramps alone aren't really a good indicator of when you ovulate.  You should use them along with other signs to notice a pattern in your cycle.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	The key to conception is having sex during a small window of time around ovulation, when a ripened egg is released from one of the ovaries and moves into the fallopian tube. So, the second important thing you need to know to pinpoint your most fertile days is when you ovulate. Here's how to find out:<br>  <br>  If your cycles are very regular, you may be able to determine when you ovulate by doing some simple math: in the average menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs 14 days before the menstrual period arrives -- or on day 14 of a 28-day cycle. So if you subtract 14 days from the length of your cycle, you'll get an idea of when you ovulate.<br>  <br>  If your cycles aren't very regular, or you'd like a more accurate picture of your ovulation, you can try one of the following techniques for pinpointing ovulation:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Track your temperature. One of the tip-offs that ovulation has occurred is that a woman's regular body temperature (or basal body temperature) increases slightly. You can detect this "thermal shift" by taking your temperature every morning at the same time before you get out of bed. If you chart your temperature each day for a few months, you'll probably begin to see a pattern that will help you predict when you are about to ovulate. Most women's temperature increases about a half a degree 24 to 48 hours after ovulation. (You may want to buy a special basal body temperature thermometer, which is more sensitive than a regular thermometer).<br>  <br>  Use an ovulation predictor kit. This method is more expensive than tracking your temperature, but may be more accurate. Available in drugstores, an ovulation predictor kit measures the level of luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine. By testing your urine using the kit (this usually involves urinating on tester sticks), you can find out when LH levels are rising, a sign that one of your ovaries is about to release an egg.<br>  <br>  Watch for changes in your cervical mucus. This low-tech method for monitoring fertility won't pinpoint exactly when you've ovulated, but it will give you some indication of whether you're in a fertile period or not. As your body prepares to ovulate, it produces larger quantities of thin, clear cervical mucus, a substance that smoothes the way for the sperm to meet the egg. On your most fertile days, just before ovulation, the mucus will appear clear, stretchy, and slippery -- a bit like raw egg whites. After ovulation, when your fertile days are past, the mucus usually becomes thicker, then gradually dries up. To collect a sample of your cervical mucus, gently wipe your vaginal opening with toilet paper or a clean finger. (If you try this several times over a single day and don't see any mucus at all, you're probably not in a fertile period of your cycle.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Figure out when to have sex<br>  <br>  Once you have a clear picture of your cycle, there's only one thing left to do -- get down to business! This is probably the most misunderstood part of the conception puzzle. For example, if you have intercourse once you've ovulated, you may be too late! Most healthcare practitioners advise you to have sex every day or every other day beginning about five days before ovulation, and continuing through the day after ovulation. Why? Because, though sperm can live as long as three to five days inside a woman's body, an egg's life span is only about 12 to 24 hours. By having intercourse before you ovulate, as well as on the day of and the day after ovulation, you maximize your chances of getting pregnant.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  How much is too much? Some couples are concerned that having frequent sex will deplete the man's sperm supply. But healthy testes constantly generate fresh sperm, so daily sex shouldn't pose a problem.<br>  <br>  What position is best? Whichever position feels best! It doesn't matter to the sperm or the egg which sexual position you use -- and it's not necessary to stay in bed, stand on your head, or do anything else special to help things along. Just do what comes naturally, and enjoy!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So what if you don't get pregnant?<br>  <br>  If you're under 35 and have had properly timed intercourse for 12 months, or 35 or older and have been trying for six months, then it's time to see the doctor for a fertility evaluation. Talk to your ObGyn about where to begin.

kf7XLE8kaa	Keep your baby.  The ONLY thing your baby needs is you.  There are ways to work around every potential issue you have.  If you need to find another babysitter, you can probably get state assistance to pay for that provider.  If you'd rather stick with your mom, you can work nights.  You could even work from home doing medical billing or virtual assistant stuff (I'm working on getting this set up now for myself).  You could get more education (paid for by the government) and in a short time, could have a much better paying job.  <br>  <br>  Your baby knows  you already, and by the time s/he is born, s/he will know your voice, your moods, your heartbeat, and your baby will expect to be held and comforted by YOU after the ordeal of birth.  And your child will expect to be fed by you and loved by you daily, because that is how humans are programmed.  If you suddenly disappear from your baby's life, s/he WILL notice, and it will be traumatic.  Some adoptees experience this trauma throughout life.  <br>  <br>  With a little planning and help, you can raise your baby, and keep him/her safe from your verbally abusive mother.  There is no need to put yourself or your baby through the traumatic lifelong separation that is adoption.  Take care, and best of luck to you and your precious babe.|`|AA12127693	KEEP IT -|`|jLppTLOmaa	Please keep it|`|7JEojMgQaa	The first 5 years you don't need much in the way of stuff for your child.

Something I was never told.|`|l1STgPyRaa	if you think that there is no way for you to look after the child then yes adoption is a option but as an adopted i had wished my birth mother had aborted me instead of adoption as the ones that i got was a total nightmare and the state admit the rate of child abuse is higher in adoption. but that is up to you <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|xKSr1ld8aa	Keep your baby and change your babysitter or get your mother to change her ways.  You do have time to prepare yourself and see what help/support you're entitled to.<br>  <br>  When I was pregnant (and working) I made it quite clear I wanted to raise my son even though I was single but got coerced into surrendering my son.  I have had to live with that every day of my life and will continue to do so even though I have had my now 27 year old son back in my live well over 4 years and he has lived with us for over two years.  We are making our own memories but nothing can replace the lost years.|`|G5DpmYKaaa	KEEP UR BABY!!!! ADOPTION IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!! GOD BLESS YOU|`|AaxIZSTwaa	There are several kinds of adoptions now. You can handpick the parents you want to adopt your child, and you can do an open adoption, which allows you to stay in touch with the parents and see how your child is growing up. Some open adoptions just send a letter once a year keeping you updated, but there are other adoptions where you actually see the baby a couple times a year. My husband was adopted and his adopted family is wonderful. Adoption can be a blessing for people who are unable to have kids. However, its a decision you have to live with for the rest of your life, so its important to look at all the options and choose the one that will work best for you. I know people who have kept the baby and made it work, but I've also seen what a blessing adoption has been. You can look into state assistance for daycare and also there are apartments who will base your rent on how much you make at your job. Good luck with everything.|`|Dd6y8YDfaa	Keep it. It sounds like in your heart of hearts you want to keep your child it's just financial and extended family that worries you.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day what a child needs most and it sounds like you a really thinking about what is best for your child which shows you love them. <br>  <br>  You can gets loads of help from the government and charities and I'm sure that you will be able to find friends or maybe other family who can help you (maybe the fathers parents can help you out too).<br>  <br>  Stay strong. You'll make a wonderful mother|`|zLoyo24Taa	You are the only one who can make this decision. Finical situations change every day. Not having enough money is not the reason to give up a child. If not having enough money is your only reason, you can get child support and get help from the many agencies out there. If you truly do not want to parent, then that is a totally different situation.|`|KasFZL7laa	there are a ton of government programs that can help mothers like you.  i can see that you want to have this baby and want to do everything you can to take care of it.  i think you need to get in touch with someone who can explain to you the government benefits you can take advantage of, it might help ease your mind.
WPI0Z47saa	It would be too early to tell and sometimes takes up to 2 weeks for your body to even conceive the baby after sex since you have to wait for implatation to occur. You don't always ovulate at the same time each month. I know it seems like it takes forever when you are trying to have a baby and you always NEED to know asap but you really have to wait to see if you miss your period. Don't be surprised if you get a false negative if you test early. Sometimes your hormones are low and don't register on a urine test right away. Mine didn't show up until I was 7 weeks pregnant. I had to confirm it with a blood test instead. Good luck.|`|LlVJiVoIaa	i tested with OPk and didnt get a positive once, i also didnt get any EWCM and i got a positive this month!!!<br>  <br>  think positive-i dint think it was my month, turns out it was!!!!<br>  <br>  baby dust hun-keep us updated!!!|`|txSiQc7Waa	Pregnancy only happens when you ovulate. So unless you ovulated really early I would take what your tests said and assume that ovulation didn't happen this month. Or it could be that your tests didn't work and that you did ovulate and now it's just a waiting game. Your best indicator will be a missed period. Good luck to you and baby dust!|`|FA1rRzUxaa	Did you get any signs of ovulation? EWCM, raise in temp, sore boobs, etc? Some people have a very short LH that can only be picked up on an OPK for a couple of hours, so it can be easily missed. Id take a HPT to see if you are pregnant. <br>  <br>  If your not pregnant and dont get a positive on OPK next month id go to see your DR|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	u could be but some times those tests dont work all the time and u don' t always feel yourself ovulating. Good luck tho.
Fd4lITkvaa	It needs to be constant strong stimulation and won't do a thing if your body isn't already about to go into labor. It's a good technique to use if your water has broke and labor hasn't started. Most often it's easiest to use a double sided breast pump for 30-60min at a time.
57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	It's hard, isn't it?  I hope it gets easier on you, and that the result is worth the discomfort!|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm happy I'm pregnant and I wouldn't want to change it.<br>  Yeah the skin tags and pimples and hair and that is annoying, but my baby is worth it.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I'm with you also my 1st pregnancy wasn't that bad and I actually enjoyed it! With this one I hate it and just wish she would come out already. I'm 36 weeks pregnant and ever since the beginning she has made me go through so much pain.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I like being pregnant for the most part but sometimes it gets to me. It is hard being pregnant and isn't always glamerous. It is normal how you are feeling. It will all come together and be worth it once you get to hold your baby. But everyone feels the way that you are at some point in their pregnancies. Good luck.|`|AA12105454	It sounds like your at the beginning of your pregnancy so its understandable to feel this way. Hopefully  you would start to feel better after your three months|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Aww! Poor girl! Well, every pregnancy is different. I really don't like being pregnant either. I hope it's over soon! I really want to hold her....<br>  <br>  How far along are you? My 1rst and 3rd trimester suck!|`|HbciMmROaa	I tried so hard to get pregnant for a year..and now i am miserable. I am so excited to have a baby again..BUT I am 8 weeks and SO sick..I did have two jobs as waitress and I had to quit one the other day cause I just couldnt get out of bed or i would get sick, I am so lucky I have my fiance or I dont know what i would do..<br>  <br>  I am over the nausea the pimples the dry peeling lips the fact that i can hardly eat but have already gained 5 pounds..my motivation to do anything but sleep is gone. I think i may have a bit of depression if that is at all normal.<br>  <br>  I cant wait to have this child. I sometimes wish I could be one of those moms who didnt know she was pregnant until she went into labor. I cant take the vitamins so i take flintstone vitamins . I am completely with you on your pain|`|3ab796e59e654e494e3c24254858129baa	I'm only 12 weeks, but I know i'm gonna be a definite ***** when i'm farther along! <br>  <br>  I have the same thing with acne! It's disgusting! I try washing my face every couple hours just with water and it's refreshing!<br>  <br>  It's only this early and I don't even feel sexy anymore. I feel like a slob and don't want to do anything! My stomach and arms are also getting HAIRY. <br>  <br>  I FEEL so... BLAH. <br>  <br>  I hear you on everything you're saying!<br>  <br>  It's a blessing, but the symptoms that go along with it; are not. =(|`|1aHchY9raa	I feeeeel the exact same way !!!!!<br>  like i dont care for how i look, im always bitchy, its like i turned into a monster, i have bad acne, i hate how my hormones swing, its something different all the time. i dont want to do anything but watch tv, or sleep all day cause i feel so.. not normal.. i dont find no interest in doing myself up even for my boyfriend lol everyday im crying, about something.. but he doesnt complain we still make love like everyday. Im now 18 weeks pregnant.|`|xX0zKzw8aa	HAHAHAH, I so said the same things until I hit that magical second trimester! Once you hit 15 weeks pregnancy miraculously turns wonderful.  Trust me it will come to an end, just hold out for it!  Nobody ever warns you about how horrible that first trimester really is. Best of luck and enjoy it!|`|d1df7701087311fcf1008982d372a396aa	i can relate. it's a blessing to be able to get pregnant but this is my second pregnancy and i'm just so over it! i can't wait to give birth. Hang in there!|`|vygYFdsSaa	I'm sorry you're feeling this way :( How far along are you?? I don't think it sucks but I'm not having as extreme symptoms as you. Hope it gets better soon!|`|Cxdxo393aa	im right there with you!!!! the only thing good about pregnancy is the baby itself, which i wish would just hurry up and come out.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I agree with the first poster haha. <br>  The only good thing is the baby, and I too wish it would just come out!|`|DxZjK1J7aa	I know how you feel...when I was pregnant and miserable like you, people made me feel guilty that I wasn't...the normal "glowing" pregnant lady.  I was fat, tired in pain, and just down right miserable.  But one thing I can tell you is (and I know you've heard it a thousand times) it's worth it!!  Best of luck!|`|Wy4T7PuIaa	ugh i know what u mean...i don't want to be pregnancy..there's nothing wrong wit it..just that the hormones things...creeps me out like crazy!!
VS8mactUaa	If you notice it when he wakes up, he could be pinching a nerve while he sleeps, take note of when and where it happens, for how long and the circumstances surrounding the blue arms and hands, like what he eats, how hes sitting ect. Good Luck.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	my daughter had this. up til about 8 weeks. its to do with th eoxygen circulating around the body. next time this happens check the area where blood is most circulating ie tongue lips, scrotum or gental area. if this is also blue it could be that your babies lungs or heart have some problems getting oxygen round the body( the pink colours baby has is blood with lots of oxgen blue tones means no oxygen or the supply is sluggish)<br>  <br>  because your only seeing this in the lower arms (my daughters feet were always blue) it could mean that your boys circulation system is just a little immature and is actually very common. it will go away as he gets older. if you notice anything else please dont hesitate to get it checked and by all means get another opinion but just thought id share my experience with my daughter:)|`|gpTOomPvaa	I have terrible blood circulation (my hands and feet are always cold and always fall asleep, especially when I sit still, or try to sleep) since he's so tiny this could possibly be what is happening to him since the doctor's have observed no problems with his heart  (I have "perfect blood pressure etc etc etc  blah blah blah")  so as the poster before said try and observe all his conditions before and while this occurs for a few times, and then after you do that a few times try rubbing his hand(s) and see if that returns them to pink quicker... this could very well be it...
vigFmfLmaa	It's a pricey brand.  I have very very irregular periods and I use the cheap dip stick tests I buy online.  They work just as well.  If your periods are very irregular any test may not work well.  You may not be ovulating efficiently, which could result in odd tests.|`|smsUZG4Iaa	yes that is a good one it does work for an irregular period|`|04ZBuoqWaa	I have never used the Clearblue brand of ovulation kit, but I always use their pregnancy tests. I took one of their hpt and it was positive when the doctors said no. Turns out I am but it took a blood test to prove it. Clearblue caught what the doctor's test didn't. That should say enough!|`|GQBd4WUSaa	i think it would be better and cheaper if you just had sex every day for a month.
Y8ZmuWwgaa	If you like unusual names, Lorelei is a great one to consider. It's pronounced LOR-uh-lie and is fairly familiar because of its use in the popular show Gilmore Girls. I like it because it's known while still not common. The name is based in a German myth about a mermaid with the same name.<br>  <br>  On the other end of the spectrum, one of my favorite -M names is Madeleine. It's #3 on my girls' list. A simplified spelling is Madeline -- it's the more often used of the two in the US. It's very sweet and simple, but still holds an alluring air. If you're looking for something more interesting, the Biblical Magdalene or variation Magdalena might appeal. <br>  <br>  If your taste runs toward the classic, here are some lovely ones you might consider. (I'm focusing primarily on -L and -M names.)<br>  <br>  Laura<br>  Louisa<br>  Lisa<br>  Lucy<br>  Leah<br>  Lydia<br>  Maura (variant spelling Moira)<br>  Marianne<br>  Margaret (Margot)<br>  Miranda<br>  <br>  If you prefer names that are familiar but not necessarily classic, here are a few to think about:<br>  <br>  Lauren<br>  Lola<br>  Lila<br>  Lily<br>  Lorraine<br>  Luciana<br>  Margot<br>  Melissa<br>  Mara<br>  Meredith<br>  Megan<br>  Mirabel<br>  Maeve<br>  Maya<br>  Maren<br>  Matilda<br>  Marilyn<br>  <br>  Some names that generally appeal to most people I know:<br>  <br>  Elizabeth<br>  Caroline<br>  Isobel<br>  Katherine<br>  Charlotte<br>  Annabel (Annabelle)<br>  Nicole<br>  Alexandra<br>  Rachel<br>  Violet<br>  Susannah<br>  <br>  Good luck -- I hope I could help!|`|SpcYCBndaa	alana|`|VGij9p0Taa	Congrats I assume! <br>  L names:- <br>  Lucinda meaning light <br>  Lilian meaning a lily <br>  Liliana meaning gracious lily <br>  Lindsey the name is associated with water <br>  R names:- <br>  Roanna meaning sweet and gracious <br>  Rachel meaning ewe <br>  Reagan meaning royalty <br>  Rae meaning ewe <br>  Other's <br>  Catherine meaning pure maiden <br>  Nadine meaning hope <br>  Jasmine meaning sweet smelling flower <br>  Willow meaning basically the plant name <br>  I hope I helped with everything and good luck!|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Lucy, Lilly, Leanne, Layla, Lola, Louise, Lindy, Lisa, <br>  <br>   Megan, Madaline, Matilda, Maisy, Milly, Molly, Mandy, Marley, Minnie,|`|wdXQaATDaa	These are my favs:<br>  Addison Caroline<br>  Evelyn Faith<br>  Eden Savannah<br>  Lucie Elizabeth<br>  Madison Riley<br>  Annalise Rose<br>  Raelyn Elise|`|MNuS31nsaa	layla, megan, leslie, masey|`|z98aPYQqaa	I think Leah is sweet.<br>  <br>  good luck x|`|9OKG0a5Baa	L<br>  luccia faith<br>  lila mae / lila grace<br>  lilly marie<br>  lauren angelique<br>  laura catherine<br>  leilani jane / leilani mae<br>  lyra nicole<br>  lisette joelle<br>  lydia colette   <br>  leticia mae <br>  leonie marie / leona mae <br>  leisel alexandra<br>  lilith alexandra<br>  luna marrianne<br>  <br>  M<br>  marrianne louise<br>  mabel lorette<br>  melissa grace<br>  melanie faith<br>  martha jane<br>  marsha lisette<br>  magdalena leigh<br>  maisie samantha<br>  malia grace<br>  margot lisette<br>  maia colette<br>  mercy gabrielle<br>  miranda fay<br>  monique eloise<br>  <br>  good luck and congratulations|`|ValLVBcYaa	L names:<br>  <br>  Lara<br>  Lilliana<br>  Lianne<br>  Louise<br>  Lauren<br>  Laura<br>  Lyla<br>  Lyra<br>  Labelle<br>  Lynda<br>  Larissa<br>  Laoise(Lee-sha)<br>  LauraLynn<br>  Leah<br>  Leahy<br>  Leone<br>  Leona<br>  Leigh<br>  Levina<br>  Liana<br>  Libby<br>  Liberty<br>  Lilac<br>  Lindsay<br>  Lindy<br>  Lisa<br>  Lori<br>  Lorraine<br>  Lucy<br>  Lynnbeth<br>  Lydia<br>  Lizzie<br>  <br>  M names:<br>  <br>  Madison<br>  Madeline<br>  Madeleine<br>  Madelynn<br>  Myra<br>  Millie<br>  Maura<br>  Mina<br>  Maria<br>  Mabelle<br>  Madina<br>  Macey<br>  Machelle<br>  Michelle<br>  MacKenna<br>  MacKenzie<br>  Mabyn<br>  Maddy<br>  Madonna<br>  Mae<br>  Maeve<br>  Maegan<br>  Megan<br>  Mahon<br>  Malli<br>  Mairead<br>  Mikayla<br>  Malina<br>  Malinda<br>  Malissa<br>  Mallory<br>  Melonie<br>  Madelina<br>  Mandy<br>  Monica<br>  Marcie<br>  Marjorie<br>  Marlie<br>  Mary<br>  Memphis<br>  Miranda<br>  Missy<br>  Miyo<br>  Mya<br>  <br>  Some suggestions:<br>  Adalyn<br>  Arianna<br>  Isabella<br>  Bianca<br>  Gabriella<br>  Zarah<br>  Serenity<br>  Carolyn<br>  Shauna<br>  Lexy<br>  Alexis<br>  Adalia<br>  Bailee<br>  Cara<br>  Ysabelle<br>  Fallyn<br>  Nicola<br>  Dani<br>  Gabbie<br>  Oriana<br>  Rosalyn<br>  Octavia<br>  Suna<br>  Anneka<br>  Clarissa<br>  Ayla<br>  Rena<br>  Isla<br>  Maddalena<br>  Ciara<br>  Ysabel<br>  Isobel<br>  Dahna|`|DWLfKACYaa	Lydia<br>  Louissa (loo-iss-ah)<br>  Louelle<br>  Louella<br>  Lola<br>  Luci/Lucie<br>  Lula<br>  Lianna/Liana/Leanna/Leana<br>  Lila<br>  Leela/Lela<br>  Lottie<br>  Leila/Layla<br>  Lorna<br>  Marissa/Marisa<br>  Meg<br>  Moira<br>  Martha<br>  Marta<br>  Milly/Millie<br>  Miley/Milee<br>  Maisy/Maisie/Maisi<br>  Maya|`|qR2G2WcMaa	Well names i like the names:<br>  <br>  Lucy (thats my name)<br>  Lola<br>  Lauren<br>  Lexi<br>  <br>  Maddison<br>  Melisa<br>  Megan|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Aubrey Michelle<br>  Myla Rose<br>  Makayla Rae<br>  Madison Grace<br>  Kendra <br>  McKarliah (mic-kar-lee-uh)<br>  Gracelyn|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	my fav's that start with M:<br>  melody & Macie<br>  <br>  L names: <br>  Laurel & Lillian|`|JU351q6Naa	Leah<br>  Lilyana<br>  Lilian<br>  Layla<br>  Lilly<br>  Lyla<br>  <br>  Madelyn<br>  Madison<br>  Maisie|`|FA1rRzUxaa	if i have a girl im going to call her Maisie.

AA11659150	Yep.  It's normal and it won't hurt him.  (It's the same stuff your baby will get and if it's ok for baby, it's ok for daddy!  ha ha)  I haven't experienced it yet myself, but they say every gal is different.  Get some pads to stick in your bra to help prevent leak throughs.  <br>  <br>  Just another wonderful side effect of pregnancy!  Yay!  GL!<br>  <br>  And you won't induce labor doing that at 19 wks as long as you aren't a high risk pregnancy.  Double check it with your MD, but I am sure that all is well!|`|AA10888290	totally fine but I would be careful because you can induce labor.|`|v0aKxF6iaa	it is normal for you to leak and as for your husband sucking on them i would ask the doctor. If you are at risk for pre-term labor his sucking milk out can induce labor.|`|04ZBuoqWaa	It's normal to leak colostrum and it should be okay for you husband to keep doing it.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	You're fine.|`|hIzQyflqaa	lucky you, mine came out from about 12wks!!|`|lHjXeN8oaa	it happens... one of those nice little joys of pregnancy that they don't always mention.  :)  as long as you are not having any kind of side effect from it, i am sure it is fine - i know that breast stimulation can throw you into labor so you might keep that in mind if you should start having problems with pre-term labor.|`|NHo0wFbcaa	He should be ok, and you are fine as well.
uFrqC4Y2aa	Find out if you're pregnant first. THen think about it. Also think about which school has a better program for what you want to do. See if he can switch to your school.|`|SKJsfRImaa	You should be thinking about your education first and him second.

I would be GLAD that the school took action against you!|`|8da3be4551c7e1c53e060cc0a71f5376aa	Grow up, stupid kid. My child would get much more severe discipline from me than from the school.

Last year none of that went on. Thats a dumb reason for getting a suspension.
sxecXFgraa	If my kids got suspended for making fun of someone I would be extremely upset.  And if my kids tried to get out of it by lying, they would get their little behinds beaten when we got home.|`|2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	I wouldn't be mad if my kid got suspended for that. In fact, I authorized in-school suspension once when my daughter kept cutting classes in 10th grade!<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like you deserved the suspension.  It may not seem "fair" to you as a schoolyard bully, but then life isn't fair. Consider this a hard lesson learned.<br>  <br>  Even if you did get picked on first as you are attempting to claim (i.e. lie about),  as a parent or a teacher, I would've told you It takes a bigger person to walk away from a fight...you should've been the bigger person and that you still shouldn't have made fun of that person back, no matter what!  <br>  <br>  p.s.  When I was a schoolgirl back in the 60s and 70s, BOTH kids would've gotten in trouble, not just one...but then I went to parochial school and the nuns were like that! They brooked no nonsense about such things.  Nowadays, the teachers are too afraid of parents and students suing them.  Too many parents out there pretending their kids are such little angels when they're really devils incarnate!|`|cAtWxJG1aa	how mad would i be at the school or the kid? if my kid got in school suspension for making fun of someone i'd be very disappointed in my kid but not mad at the school.<br>  <br>  how mad would i be if my kid made up some story that someone else started it if that was not in fact true? very mad -- a lot more than i'd be if they owned up to their mistake and apologized for it.  and they'd be looking at a lot more than in-school suspension.|`|f66ce5d864eadcad29348fd4a9871771aa	so, you are going  to lie on top of everything else. lovely child you are, i bet your mother is proud. take your punishment, you deserve whatever you get, you would be grounded at home too if you were mine. stop making fun of people and behave yourself and you wont have this problem.|`|F6lZHRkVaa	I'd be very mad.

Of course I am not naive and I know that they will do it anyway but I will punish them accordingly. Just because the other child started it gives them any right to do it back.

AA10196172	You can have what look like periods for a month or several during pregnancy. I have heard of several women who were taken by surprise to suddenly discover they were several months along. (Like my MIL who found out she was 5 months with my wife).<br>  <br>  Google "decidual bleeding" for more info.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	I doubt your pregnant if your bleeding.|`|xpstigPTaa	sorry but I don't think your pregnant.|`|AA11659150	The only bleeding during preg that is normal is early implantation bleeding, early preg spotting (light pink not red or clotty!), and labor and delivery bleeding.  <br>  <br>  If you are bleeding longer than that, you are not pregnant or if you were, you may be miscarrying.  If that's the case, go to the MD ASAP.|`|Cxdxo393aa	its rare but u can still have a period when pregnant but its definitely not a sign of being pregnant.|`|b0ff0526fe90638f8e2ac0fea7c1171caa	no bleeding during pregnancy like a period is not normal.

OgzHcNMsaa	I think it's better to buy a swim suit. and wear it over the swim diaper|`|jdRKZe18aa	Swim diapers are a MUST - more so than a suit.|`|aLAmvX5Naa	It depends on the pool.

There are some really inexpensive (yet cute) suits out there.|`|8RfmosODaa	You could just put her in a swim diaper but i like the idea of a bathing suit or a swimsuit with spf 50 on it.

Just put sunscreen on her or him and have fun!!|`|tmh42R6Caa	I think a swim diaper would be fine.  I feel like I should put my son in a swim suit, but honestly, I think it's perfectly fine to go with just the diaper.  You could call your pool to see what they say before you go.|`|aJTBF7opaa	Diaper alone is just fine, its personal choice if you want a bathing suit, all is being covered that needs to be covered.|`|zXGTDkZmaa	swim diapers are fine thats what i used just make sure baby has sunblock, hat, shoes (sandels) and glasses.

I think that rule is for of course lil girls. and that sometimes diapers dont get put on tight enough and or the baby is to small for them so the suit helps hold it on.|`|kIpDDVc9aa	I would say to put a swim diaper on her, AND a little bathing suit just to make sure it won't come off that easily. It will also protect them a bit more because sometimes, community centre pools aren't that clean.|`|EcLldImCaa	Please dont put the baby in danger because if the neighborcord is still on it can harm the babie but if you think its a good idea then give it a bathing suit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|pGoNUM8maa	All you need is a diaper, but if you want your baby to look stylish, use a swim suit also : )|`|Qg4lUCodaa	THEY NEED BATHING SUITS AND THOSE LITTLE SWIMMER DIAPERS, GO TO TARGET|`|VtW5AX77aa	diapers all the way|`|cpuydZvNaa	it depends what tipes of dipers but oh and age but if you have the right kind of dipers otherwise yes|`|ek1193Qiaa	bathing suite

But especially since all such laws tend to be passed by men who also will never experience pregnancy, I don't think it's the government's business what a woman does with her body or its contents.  I would rather see the meddling busybodies devote their time and resources to the needs of children already born.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	In very extreme cases, yes.

Also, who pays for the welfare checks they receive. We do. Let them abort their mistakes.|`|AA12034666	Let's put it this way: I don't think it should be dis-allowed. I think it should be up to the medical professionals, the people involved and their own personal conscience. Nobody should be able to make a law preventing what someone can do with their own body.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I think that it should only be allowed in a Dr's office. Not in clinics where the Dr doesn't know your medical history or anything. And it should only be done when the baby is endangering the mother's life and it is necessary for the mother to live.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	first off, a fetus is incapable of feeling pain until abortions are no longer legal. second, abortions are already allowed in the US and should remain that way. they are better off safe and legal.|`|Knierqi9aa	It should be ALLOWED.|`|1XCFEmp4aa	yeah I personally think it should.|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	no it shouldnt be allowed|`|488edafbffd854a7df677efa90768cabaa	Personally, I think abortion for any reason other than health risk to the mother is abominable.

However, I do think that we need to continue the campaign to urge women to choose other alternatives.|`|rpsXPdFmaa	Yes I do feel it should be allowed.

All you could see was this small empty black space, which was the pregnancy sac.  At 5 weeks gestation,the fetus didn't even have nerves, so couldn't even feel pain.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with abortion in every situation, but I know my situation and I did what was right for me and it's no one's business.<br>  <br>  If we make abortion illegal, then we'll only go back to the days of women trying to do it themselves with wire coat hangers and drugs!|`|6zCm65haaa	i'm not [sure i'm frm uk] its 1 of those Q'S  where there int a wrong or a right answer i wunt never av a abortion and i dont no much about it <br>  <br>  but what i do no is that earlier this year we ad a really really bad case of child abuse where there was this lil baby P who was tourchered to  death wen i read the case i wud av gave anyfing to have taken his pain away and shown him the love he never had in his short life [he was 17 mths old bith the biggest blus eyes]<br>  <br>  anyway wot am trying to say is if a mother or father are like that then maybe it is better to get the child aborted than to let it suffer all its life it kills me to say this as am ttc wiv out sucsess <br>  <br>  childeren deserved to be loved and if u cant giv it that or u just dont want to, then dont let it suffer in pain|`|ozWi3TJlaa	Yes.  While I wouldn't chose to have one, I don't think the government or anyone else for that matter has the right to tell me what to do with my own body, nor would I tell anyone else what to do with theirs.<br>  <br>  I have two daughters.  If one of them were gang-raped and ended up pregnant, I would not judge her if she wanted an abortion.<br>  <br>  I suppose this won't be a popular answer among people who believe differently, but you just asked for opinions.|`|9o9igzKEaa	Yes it should be allowed- <br>  First of all, all abortions take place in the first trimester, usually when the "baby" is till a little grouping of cells that can barely be seen my the human eye.<br>  Secondly nobody should be forced by law to give birth to a child a rapist gave to them. In America you should have the freedom of choice, to an extent that it is not used as an alternate form of contraception.<br>  The government does not need to step in that far to rule every aspect of our lives.|`|HWSMljLoaa	doctor 1: hey bob, can you pass the scalpel?<br>  bob: *whispers* shh! what the hell are you trying to do, get us sued!?<br>  doctor 1: what are you talking about?<br>  bob: *whispers* listen, talk quietly, please. don't you know, abortions aren't aloud in america yet.<br>  doctor 1: you mean... we have to --<br>  bob: *whispers* -- have a silent abortion, yeah.<br>  doctor 1: that's just dumb, i think aloud abortions should be allowed.<br>  bob: *whispers* agreed. now shut up!|`|euFLT8eCaa	So, if a 13 year old girl is raped, she should be forced to have the baby?  Due to these gray areas, you can not simply say that it should not be allowed.Plus, you can not make a law saying its illegal, when not everyone believes the same thing. You shouldnt be asking this kind of question when you cant even spell allowed.|`|Iu0CfKCvaa	Abortion is murder plain and simple.  It is a horrific "choice" indeed.<br>  It's evil, disgusting, and shows how selfish mankind is.

You have to do what's best for you and it could very well be that you are in labor!!!  <br>  <br>  You might have a bladder infection tho... That could be a separate issue.  <br>  <br>  And I have heard that every preg is different.  So don't worry that this one is from the last one.

I hope you didn't take him too seriously. I lied first about some money me and my friend had stolen, to keep myself outta trouble..."oh I never knew where the money came from" well I gotta keep all the stuff I bought and he had to work it off, I then became addicted to it, lied to everyone about everything, all the time, sometimes I would not even notice what I was doing, It would just happen. I am 26 now, I have two kids and a wife that is about to leave me if I don't stop lying to her, I have a 2nd degree theft charge that i caught when a lie didn't go over very well. I have lost jobs, friends, girlfriends, and more irreplaceable, respect and trust from those who you lie to. You have to remember that no matter what you lie about or to who, that person will think that everything you say isn't true, not a big deal now, I mean your just a kid, but if you do what I did, get addicted to it, and use it as a survival method and a defense all the time, you will live a lie, you will be a lie, and you won't even know what the truth is any more, you will never have any close friends, because no one will trust you, you will never have a long term relationship with a girl, cause they won't stand being lied to for any reason. I hope you don't think "That won't happen to me" cause I did, and it did, Main thing buddy, start being honest now, about everything, no matter what, make amends and tell the truth now for any lies you have told, take the heat, get in trouble, believe me the people who you have lied to would much rather hear the truth from you then find out that you were a piece of trash lier like me, pride yourself on the truth. <br>  <br>  "All I have is my B*lls and My Word, and I am not breaking either of them for anybody" --Scarface.|`|cFoBxLDVaa	Your only in sixth grade if people don't like the truth tell them to stick it where the sun don't shine cause your only being honest.

8iaCr4Vxaa	We are always needing new foster parents. 0-3 is a good age group.  My husband and I fostered over 16 older kids, and it was very trying.  The older kids say from 7 to 12 have a lot of baggage and issues.  We stopped fostering older kids in 2007, and only foster babies. We are on our 7th baby  All of our babies have been drug exposed, and one was severely addicted.  Fostering is not an easy thing to do, and you don't make money doing it, if anything you spend more of your own money.  I have people tell me " I couldn't do what you do.  I would become too attached"  I tell them if you don't do it who will.  Yes its hard, and Yes you do get attached.  When the baby leaves you cry.  But then 2 days later the phone rings, and another baby arrives.  It is all worth it.|`|6CU00J1Yaa	I had a foster brother, and although I clicked with him, my parents didn't. <br>  These kids come from broken homes and need rehabilitation. Although CAS will compensate you for a good chunk of expenses, you will be paying the psychiatrist bills yourself (if you are not Canadian on OHIP), and they are not cheap. OHIP does not cover psychologist bills, unless your company covers it for dependants. <br>  Do research before taking on this huge investment (emotionally, physically and financially) or you will fail.|`|GidSzywKaa	I always wanted to be a foster mom, but then I found out that you can't spank foster kids. SCREW THAT!|`|AA10494763	We are foster to adopt parents for only a year. It is stressful but has been rewarding.|`|WfotGbjNaa	who would want to do that, your own kids can be enough pain in the a**
8WRnqs08aa	It is possible for you to have a yeast infection, as the increase in hormones could cause a change in your pH level. I had a yeast infection in the early weeks of my last pregnancy, but there is nothing SAFE to treat you in the first trimester. The Dr. wouldn't give me a remedy until the second trimester stating that if treated in the first trimester, the meds could cause miscarriage or defects to the fetus.<br>  <br>  Make an appt to see a Dr. before trying any over the counter remedies as well!<br>  <br>  Best of luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (babies #5&6)|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	Im 9 weeks today and not too long ago I had a yeast infection. I also had the same white discharge and it kinda itch. I got concerned that it would affect my baby so I went to the doctor and found out it was. So if you are concern about it and feel discomfort see a doctor they will give you something for it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck my Lady and Congrats on the Baby!!!!|`|fbca90d1a5095e661e095b47574cb750aa	It could be a yeast infection, they are common in pregnant women. Is it itchy or burn? Or is the discharge kinda clumpy like cottage cheese? If so then it is probably a yeast infection. Best thing to do is call the dr. Even if you haven't seen the dr yet they can still call you in a prescription that will get rid of it fast.|`|0fd02382528c74c76d5ddc83b78b411baa	Im 32 weeks pregnant and have yeast infection from the beginning,it will stay the whole pregnancy even if you used medication. it is safe but don't use medications on shelf, you need special kind due to pregnancy.|`|Wkf0YTKtaa	You have a lot more discharge while you are pregnant.  But it is very possible to have a yeast infection.  Ask your doctor when you go.  It is safe to use Monistat while pregnant.|`|kVIOtS5gaa	Ask a doctor.|`|46PSDx1raa	no its not too early, you can go to the pharmacy and get monastat or call your doctor and see if they can prescribe you something stronger but most likely they will tell you the same thing.
3xEbZuI2aa	I think it may be because the weight of your baby is hurting you. Is your right side your strongest side of your body? so do you fall on your right foot or write with your right hand? If so that is probably why if not im sorry I have no idea :(|`|AA10250639	I'm 33 weeks -- and honey, my back hurts on one side one minute and another the next. Depends on where your baby is sitting.

Even then, things are tricky, legally - if they want you back, it doesn't take much finagling on their part to do it. Unless you're out of high school, stay at home, finish schooling, and make a responsible life plan.|`|FTFd3AQAaa	i kinda doubt it would be a good move to make... do you have a realistic plan for what you will do once in CA? to buy food and pay rent and such?|`|l1STgPyRaa	if that is what you want to do why not.<br>  <br>  but if there is no abuse or anything like that given the way things are at this stage i would stay as it would be cheaper at lest i would think <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|Ffdk1meFaa	No, live on their support as long as you can!|`|2l7lbcJWaa	Why would you want to leave Texas!|`|cj29AORfaa	if you have a plan,yeah. i have a plan so once i turn 17, Miami here I come.

Im not sure what arias stella is....<br>  <br>  excuse me-An abortion is the termination of a pregnancy by the removal or expulsion of an embryo or fetus from the uterus, resulting in or caused by its death. An abortion can occur spontaneously due to complications during pregnancy or can be induced. Abortion as a term most commonly refers to the induced abortion of a human pregnancy, while spontaneous abortions are usually termed miscarriages.<br>  <br>  I was wrong.... I just thought that maybe you could get more responses out of people if you used a different term..... as to the person below me- piss off, I was only trying to help.- wikipedia<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ALSO:The changes of the Arias-Stella reaction in endometrial glands were observed in 80% cases of intra-uterine abortions. Secretory/hypersecretory pattern was the most commonly observed type (36.67%). The reaction was seen in 3.33% each of patients evaluated for infertility and patients on hormonal therapy with oral progestational agents for the management of dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Although uncommon, the Arias-Stella reaction was noted in the epithelium of fallopian tubes (16.67%) from patients with ectopic tubal gestation. CONCLUSION: The findings of the present study emphasize the diagnostic importance of the Arias-Stella reaction. The changes of the reaction are a histological clue to the presumptive diagnosis of the presence of chorial tissue in cases in which the chorionic material is not found in the endometrial biopsy. The morphological features can be mistaken for malignancy if the pathologist is not aware of the patient's pregnancy or history of hormonal intake.--(<a href="http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract/17219163)" rel="nofollow">http://www.medscape.com/medline/abstract...</a>
bTlhBX3daa	Hi there. I am due the same day as you are and I am also having a little boy. I want to wish you and your son luck and I hope you have a quick and easy delivery and healthy baby. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you have done already, or what advice you have already gotten, so I will just give what advice I have to share. <br>  <br>  All blankets and clothing needs to be washed before the baby uses it, because the dyes can be harsh on a baby's sensitive skin, and also because you don't know who might have touched it in the store before it was bought. You need to use non-scented detergent. I am going with Dreft which I know is baby safe. <br>  <br>  Pack your hospital bag if you haven't done that already. My childbirth teacher recommends packing two bags, one with only what you will need for the labor, and another with anything else you will need for the stay in the hospital. Don't forget to pack a coming home outfit (and/or outfit for newborn pictures) in both Newborn and 0-3 Months sizes, since you don't know how big the baby will be. And make sure to pack a few things for the daddy. He will want a change or two of clothes, a toothbrush, a few snacks (for both of you) etc. <br>  <br>  Make sure the carseat is installed and daddy knows how to use it and tighten the straps, as the hospital won't let you take baby home otherwise. <br>  <br>  Start thinking about last minute purchases you need to make, if you have already had your shower. <br>  <br>  You might want to stock up on a few things around the house as you won't feel much like going grocery shopping etc. Some extra food items for meals (you can even prepare a few meals and freeze them). Extra Kotex pads for you, extra toiletpaper, papertowels, maybe paperplates and plastic utensils to avoid having dishes to do, etc. <br>  <br>  That's just some of the things I could think of, I will add more if I think of anything. But I'm sure you will get plenty of good advice on here. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	The main thing I did before baby came was get all the pets to the groomers for a good washing, got the carpets cleaned, changed air filters, and basically cleaned from top to bottom...mainly because I am a clean freak but also so it was easier for me and my husband to keep clean.  I did all that the week before my son was born.  This go round I will do the same things and in fact getting carpet replaced today.  Also I have the crib and changing table set up and all clothes washed.  I also started to pack my hospital bag.  The only thing I leave till the very last minute is sterilizing bottles and that I usually do the day we come home with baby.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	BE PREPARED!!<br>  def have formula get it as soon as posible bc i gave birth at 35 weeks & waited too long, u never know when they will come.<br>  make sure u have every thing out & in the place they need to be to use like dont have diapers stored up.. have alot of space on ur camera bc u will need it but if u have every thing u need there isnt much more to do but wait have ur diaper bag ready & bag for hospital|`|VhH9RJrSaa	go see every movie at the theaters possible! go out to eat and sleep sleep sleep!!|`|LY2LSzPJaa	1. set up babies room ( deck it out mama)<br>  2. Wash all the babies cloths in dreft ( yes including brand new ones)<br>  3. Get baby equipped , safety locks etc.<br>  4. make sure you have plenty of diapers , creams , onesies , blankets etc.<br>  5. pick out his outfit to wear home from hospital <br>  6. pack your hospital bag <br>  7.stack up on pads (for bleeding after baby) <br>  8.make room in cabinets for baby bottles , plates and baby food <br>  9. enjoy your last 10 weeks , sleep like crazy , cause when the baby comes you will not!<br>  <br>  This is a good question , with my son I was ready , I had everything ready for 10+ weeks. <br>  Now with my daughter , she kinda just came when she was ready so it was horrible I had nothing ready.|`|4g4RkSPmaa	I would #1 get your car seat installed or checked by a law authority (our area does a car seat check once a month).<br>  <br>  I would #2 get the clothes washed and cleaned for their arrival.<br>  <br>  I would #3 make sure your bags are packed or get an idea of what you want to pack so  you don't feel so rushed when that day comes.<br>  <br>  And finally, if you can, cook some meals ahead so you slip something in the oven when you are having a lazy day.|`|UJrgnREzaa	Sleep, sleep, eat, sleep, sleep, eat, take a bath, sleep, sleep in on the weekends, eat, sleep, did I say sleep.  Get as much sleep in as possible.  Babies are wonderful, but enjoy the sleep while you can.  Those days are soon to be over, but don't worry, they are worth every sleepless minute.  Congratulations.|`|39547d83a5156f9293d7f12e96038e86aa	at around the time you are now, i was seriously getting that "nesting" feeling.  i had the baby's room all set up and had already packed my hospital bag!|`|BCyg3SMBaa	Its absolutley unpredictable what you should have done. Thats the hard part. Every baby is different :)<br>  We had the bottles, the bassinet, the diapers, the wipes, EVERYTHING ready to go except the crib. BUT when my little one came home...she had sensitive skin so we had to buy new wipes & diapers...she perfered a silcone nipple and wouldnt take any other bottle, so we had to buy new bottles...she was very tiny (they told us she would be 8lbs 7oz. She was 5lbs 11oz!) so she refused to sleep in her bassinet. So her swing was (and honestly even though its not swinging still is lol). The truth is that you will never be fully prepared. Because whatever you have prepared, you baby is probably going to have other plans :)<br>  The Best advice I can give is have a swing. They are wonderful. Have more then one box of wipes floating around your house so your not running everywhere to get them (trust me you will use them for EVERYTHING :). Have recieving blankets, extra pacifiers if your baby is a pacifier kid (they get soo gross so quick from falling all over the place), and pick up the book "What To Expect The First Year" (Lifesaver For New Mommys!!), some gas drops (generic brand works just as great as Mylicon and saves money!). Boppys are also wonderful, as well as Baby Einstien DVDs. <br>  Honestly, its the little things that count. My nursery wasnt ready as baby came early, and that was ok because she refused to sleep there. Stock some things up on your nightstand or in your living room (diapers, wipes, Bottles...) or wherver you feel you might camp oiut after you have the baby and return home. It makes things a whole lot simpler because I promise the first few days are the best, but you wont feel like running around :)<br>  Best of luck!!|`|em8A42Bqaa	Im due about 4 days before you and I have the nursery ready and my bag packed.  I have all of the Essential things that she will need probably more.  <br>  <br>  The only thing that I really dont have is the car seat and I am waiting on my baby shower to get that!  <br>  <br>  Everything else is pretty much done! I cant wait!|`|hoX7hoINaa	I made sure that my house was clean like pretty much top to bottom (except the basement cuz I dont want him down there anyway) But I basically did a spring cleaning. I made sure I had enough clothes and the basics in case he came early, and got the carseat in the car. Make sure to pack a bag within the next few weeks in case of emergency. Good Luck!

JvZY0ZS4aa	I'm not too familiar with this artist and I think she usually does slightly heavier sounding stuff. However, she released a really beautiful album after she had her baby with touching songs generally about promises and feelings towards her baby. In my opinion they are perfect and beautiful songs to play to the baby after he's born - which is what I plan to do. <br>  <br>  Listening to the album I'm always touched by the words and the wonderful precious gifts I've been given in my children, with the songs also expressing perfectly how I feel as a mother towards them.<br>  <br>  You can listen to some samples of each song here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Plumb/dp/B000VAQWT2/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=music&qid=1235591904&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Plumb/dp/B00...</a><br>  <br>  The album is called Blink by Plumb. Really worth listening to each sample.|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Than you should put that one has well.Maybe a couple of lullaby's.And some other songs as well.|`|BNDRPYlRaa	I agree with blank but they should be songs that mellow out the child not scare the child like no hard rock or rap.
S1gJJHNzaa	you need to be actively trying for at least a year before most fertility drs. will even see you, there are no 'over the counter' or 'online' tests that you can purchase.<br>  <br>  my advise to you would be don't use any type of hormone birth control, don't get any STDs, eat well, no drug addictions (that includes caffeine),  eat right,  take flintstone vitamins (yeah flintstone completes!) and all in all just take care of yourself.  <br>  <br>  It can take a normal healthy couple up to a year to conceive even if everything is timed just right..<br>  <br>  so you will not know if you have any problems until after you start trying, but odds are you will be fine.<br>  <br>  good for you for waiting, I was only 21 when I had my first and I wouldn't trade her for anything but life would have been easier if I would have waited until my husband and I were married a little longer.  <br>  <br>  good luck and God Bless!<br>  <br>  <br>  edited to add, yeah, i was saying most drs won't see you until after one year and there are no OTC tests
Ka52nbhNaa	Around 3 1/2 months old, our twins started sleeping from about 8:30PM until 6:30AM . . . that lasted until very recently - they are now 6 months old and have been waking again during the night - I think it is combination growth spurt and teething.|`|G2auAv1Saa	About 3-4 weeks old. I bottle fed her and she would fall asleep around 730 and sleep until 5am, when I woke her up.|`|WlU3NFu6aa	at 13 months.<br>  breast with formula supplemented til 6.5 mo, the bottle only<br>  she sleeps at 8:30, gets up at 6 on weekdays and about 6:30-7 on weekends|`|33fa67ba937f7dc93091ebd71003e511aa	Both of my kids were bottle fed. But my first child was about 2 months old when he first slept through the night. But every now and then he would wake up for a bottle, but would go back to sleep. I would put him to bed about 9 or 10 that night and he would get up about 8 or so. My daughter on the other hand is totally backwards from my son. She is a year old and still has nights were she gets up and wants a bottle. She will sleep all night on average 4 to 5 nights a week. And I put her to bed around 9 or some after and she gets up about 7 and wants a bottle. And any little sound will wake her up. Hope this helps you some.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	My daughter is 7 months and she still doesn't sleep through the entire night. She's a very good sleeper, but she still wakes up maybe once or twice. She usually has a bottle around 8:30, and then we put her to bed. She is usually up around 6:30/7 AM.|`|l0YvaYTDaa	He's almost 6 months old and I'm still waiting!  He's breastfed.  We put him down around 7:30 p.m. and he's up for the day anywhere between 6:30 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.  As for how many times he's up in between...you never know!|`|1f8c660f42fb2996d0008deba351015daa	My son was bottle fed at that point.  He was 4 1/2 months when he started sleeping through the night.  We put him down around 9:00 or 9:30, watching his "tired" cues, and he gets up around 7:00 in the morning.|`|KYkoPHpsaa	the second day i took her home from the hospital lol, i breastfed her at about 10:30pm, put her to sleep by about 11, wake her up at 3 to feed her till about 4:00, she sleep till 7:30am<br>  <br>  She would probably sleep throughout the night if i didnt wake her lazy butt up to eat hehe|`|r4N3R0dtaa	My son was around 9 weeks old when he started to sleep through the night (he's 12 weeks now). He's breastfed. We put him down to sleep around 10:30pm and he usually wakes up around 7 or 8am.
1G3XPiq3aa	You can certainly get someone pregnant without cumming. Girls have different cycles, so she might have a shorter cycle and might already have been due to have her next one. <br>  <br>  A pregnancy test would be unlikely to give a positive result at this point regardless, as the HGC levels are low in early pregnancy. Wait a couple of weeks for her to take the test, and if she's not, remember this lesson for next time.<br>  <br>  I don't suggest doubting her to her face, unless you want a very angry girl friend.|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Should have thought about that before having sex.<br>  She can be pregnant even if you didn't ejaculate.  It's called precum.<br>  Congrats on your impending fatherhood!|`|em8A42Bqaa	She's being dramatic, b/c you had unprotected sex.|`|kT7GVOosaa	hope you can learn how in 9 months. if she is pregnant she need to take a home test and if that is negative then she needs to get a blood test from her doctor. eating a lot and sleeping in class are not very common signs of early pregnancy. he boobs should be sore and a missed period is a must for pregnancy. however if she said her last period was Jan. 1st then she was already pregnant on the 8th when you had sex. she just needs to test or go to the dr.|`|hoX7hoINaa	Well dont do the deed unprotected if you're not ready duh! But if she took a test, have her take another one. If that one is positive, get a blood test.|`|vpmRRamKaa	you shouldn't have went unprotected IF YOU KNEW<br>  you werent ready to be a father<br>  but you HAVE to c u m to make babies<br>  OMG duh! i learned that in eigth grade|`|sxZk6njLaa	If you had sex on 8th February and her last period was on the 1st January is she not curious as to where her period went in the first week of February?<br>  <br>  Anyway, I don't know what "nutted" is or what expletive YA had to censor, but if you're 'not ready to be a daddy' why on earth didn't you use something? If you're old enough to have sex surely you're old enough to know: No protection = Baby.|`|rZZjj0y4aa	It is scary, I know.(I'm a Past teenage mother.) Now, first she needs to get a test, because if you used no protection(it doesn't matter if you c***.) Those little guys swim either way so it is definitely possible that she could be pregnant. Next you need to be ready to be supportive. I am sorry but I learned too that if your willing to go there, be willing to stand up for your decision. I'm not lecturing but that is why parents tell us to wait to make those grown up decisions, whether it feels good or not. Please if she is not, use protection next time, so a couple months down the line you are not back in this situation! Good Luck!|`|pNKBszseaa	Im thinking she could be. your dates dont really aline right. Did you guys have unprotected sex anytime in january if so then she could be pregnant. Any time you have unprotected sex it can lead to pregnancy, weather you ejaculate or not. Good luck~ Wear a condom next time|`|Z1e3Cxjoaa	Well pre-*** can get a girl pregnant.  Her symptoms could be anything really...not just pregnancy.  I would ask her to do a test in your presence to make sure.  Also the dates don't match up if you have regular periods but if she is irregular a lot then there is no telling.  A sonogram that dates the pregnancy will tell you for sure.|`|dq9uclgpaa	First off pre-*** can get a girl pregnant. Second of all if you aren't ready to be a father why have unprotected sex? Not to sound mean but I'm just being honest. Tell her to take a test to be sure and start to plan it out. Are you considering Adoption? Abortion? or Raising the child?|`|AA11537248	I'm not going to give you a lecture on what you did, like half of these hens above.<br>  <br>  Wait a few more days.  If the "red army" doesn't march in to town, get one of those over-the-counter pregnancy tests.  If it's positive, get her to a doctor.  If it's negative, learn from your mistake.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Congratulations?<br>  <br>  You had unprotected sex, she could be pregnant.  Pre-ejaculate contains sperm.  Get her a pregnancy test and for crud's sake use a condom next time.|`|vJ0j5rRLaa	If you are not ready to be a daddy maybe you shouldn't be having unprotected sex!|`|V2P4ajJcaa	Actually, some studies have shown that pre-ejaculate does NOT contain sperm (see <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12286905" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12286...</a> "The more significant finding, however, was that most pre-ejaculate samples did not contain any sperm and those that did had only small clumps of a very small amount of sperm which seemed to be immobile.") <br>  <br>  How long are her cycles normally? If her last period started January 1, it's likely she would have ovulated long before February 8 and would have been infertile by the time you had sex anyway.|`|AA11506593	If you aren't ready to be a Daddy.... why in God's name are you having sex?! And you need to understand that sperm live in precum.<br>  <br>  If her last period started 01/01/09, then her next period should have started around 01/26/09 (depending on the length of her cycles). If she still doesn't have her period, she needs to go to her doctor for an accurate pregnancy test.<br>  <br>  If she is pregnant, and if you are indeed the father of the child (newsflash: You may not be the only one having unprotected sex with her), then you will be paying financially for that child for the next 18 plus years of your life! Congratulations!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	there is a possibility that she could be but there is no way she will know for sure if the unprotected sex took place just 2 1/2 weeks ago. she would have to wait like another 2 weeks to get an accurate test result. however, if you had sex prior to that and there is a chance she could have become pregnant then, that could be the reason she hasnt had her period since january and she does need to take a test now.|`|DUq74Xr7aa	if you're saying you didn't ejaculate.. sperm from a previous ejaculation that was trapped in the passage could've impregnated her! Lol<br>  That's why you always use a condom!<br>  <br>  If you truly don't want to be a *daddy* try to convince her to have an abortion.<br>  <br>  If she decides she's not going to have an abortion, or you decide not to ask her to have an abortion, then you need to make up your mind now if you're going to help her raise the child or pay child support.<br>  <br>  If you decide you're going to stay with her, make sure she eats healthy but doesn't over eat too much, otherwise you're gonna have a pretty big girl friend. If you can keep her healthy and attractive it might not be so bad. -Most young guys can't imagine life with a baby or a fat girl friend.<br>  <br>  Decide what's best for you sooner rather than later!|`|qnu6zwd4aa	first, relax. both of you. And why didnt you guys use protection, if you wouldve used protection you wouldnt be worrying. tell her to go to a free clinic and request a pregnancy test, they will never contact your parents no matter what. its in the paper you sign. Anyways, if she is pregnant you guys decide. The symptoms of pregnancy varies, you crave alot of food, you sleep alot, you pee alot, you have nausea, and more things. search it online. back to the main point, of course your not ready to be a daddy, i cant tell. do what i said and youll find out if shes pregnant within a day. it only takes two minutes to read a pregnancy test. try not to abort if she is, theres always adoption agencies. Also abortions cost money, from 250-500 dollars.|`|LY2LSzPJaa	ok a little confused , if her last period was the 1st of jan and you 2 had sex on the 8th of feb. then her period was late before then right?<br>  ALSO ANYTIME YOU HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX THERE IS A BIG CHANCE OF BECOMING PREGNANT , YOU MAY NOT HAVE THOUGHT YOU DID NOT *** INSIDE HER , BUT THERE IS PRE-***<br>  GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND WRAP IT NEXT TIME BUD|`|ngiTDGT2aa	well she still can be pregnant cause of pre ***. you just got to come to the plate and take care of you responsibilities, you made that choice by not wearing protection.good luck if she is.|`|Gn4iNKPSaa	Go buy her a test and have her take it with you. then u should know for sure. nxt time be more responsible if u don't wanna b a father. babies r expensive. good luck.|`|a6C6AXKWaa	That's "G."|`|xytNERzlaa	There is always PRE-C*M!
ibeYAlwpaa	I would personally let him cry it out. What time are you putting him down? Maybe it's to early, or maybe he's sleeping to much or to late in the evening. With my daughter she's been on the same schedule since she was at least 10 months, maybe younger and thats:<br>  10 am nap time, 2 nap time 730-8 bed time wake up at 630 7ish.... She did for awhile wake up occasionally && I would give her a bottle but that was before she turned 1 (because by then she was off bottles) But a combination of her growing out of waking up and me just letting her talk her self back to sleep got her sleeping through the night! Just wait it out… Good Luck!|`|G2auAv1Saa	I was going to say pretty much what the first poster said. <br>  <br>  Let him cry it out and maybe put him to bed a little later and evaluate how long his daytime naps are.
f9d25be9a86bcb470e6b157992207144aa	HB yes, gender no. I could barely tell my babys sex at 16w5d. I had another US at 18w4d to comfirm that he was still a he.|`|EMfLFsXEaa	My understanding is when your 4 months pregnant.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I think its about 17 weeks and so on. i had mine done at 20 weeks and we barely could see if it was girl. then I had another 1 at 27 weeks and confirmed it was a girl.|`|AA11222790	You can tell at 15 weeks however, most docs ask you to wait until 20 weeks.  The reason for this is, you get better pictures at 20 weeks.|`|iPGxXRHgaa	I saw my son's willy at just 17weeks!! & I heard my daughters heartbeat at 12weeks.... ENJOY EVERY MINUTE xx|`|otFCWMuUaa	like everyone said not till 17 weeks.. & yes you will get to hear a heartbeat and in your ultrasound they will probly show you her heartbeat..<br>  <br>  & at 9 weeks i was starting to show but i think most of it was some bloating|`|mf3OOagMaa	First, CONGRATULATIONS, Momma!!!!  <br>  Second, during your pregnancy you must remember that every pregnancy for every person is different - every 'body' is different. Don't get stuck comparing yourself to others as you are uniquely you and your pregnancy is uniquely yours. The pre-defined things that are said to occur during 1st, 2nd, & 3rd trimesters are a guideline of what occurs for the "average" woman.  Having said that - every pregnancy is different!  <br>  Which means - yes, at two months you could very likely be "showing". Your body is preparing for your baby - hormones are changing, your organs are changing - everything about you is different. With my last pregnancy (twins), I was in maternity clothes before week 6! My first pregnancy, I didn't show until I was 6 mos along. You may not be "showing" with your baby (because they are pretty tiny right now) - but you could be "showing" just the same. During a pregnancy your body produces almost 50% more blood, your tissues change - you become 'softer', your organs swell - your uterine lining is thickening - your water weight drastically increases - there is a lot happening to your body during a pregnancy! Who knows - you might be (or might not be) carrying multiples! You should learn this at the ultra-sound....<br>  As for the sex of your baby - you could do certain tests that would be able to confirm your babies sex for you. Such as an amniocentises - but for me, the risks outweighed any benefit of this test (which determines possible (not positive) abnormalties). As for an ultra-sound - it depends on the type that you are using. The ones in your doctors office have muddy images - and a professional can typically determine your babies sex somewhere between 16-22 weeks (their sex organs don't develop much earlier than that). Now these are not perfect images, and there is always room for error - but an experienced technician is generally pretty acurate - they can also show you what they are looking at to tell (because at this stage, it doesn't look like your typical sex organ). Nurses, often will bet on the sex, based on the heart beat - one sex beats faster than the other (I think the girls). If you want an ultrasound that will blow you away - try the new 3 and 4D imaging - It is almost like having a picture of your baby! For fun - you can also do the ring test (put your ring on a string and hold it above your belly - if it sways it is a boy, if it swirls it is a girl - though, I can never remember which direction is for which sex though???) <br>  As far as the heart beat, even now, you should be able to see the heart flutter (but not much more) - at your scheduled appointment, you should be able to hear it - but if you can't don't freak out (unless your doc tells you differently), because you might have an organ or your bladder might be blocking the sound, or the ultrasound device might not be in the right spot - there can be lots of things preventing you from first hearing the heartbeat. Remember it is really tiny - the important thing is to see it flutter. Be patient, though - because when you do hear it (for the first time, and every time) it is like nothing you have ever heard before. It is amazing!<br>  If you want to learn more about any of these questions, your doctor is a great source of information - a great website (that I strongly recommend) is babycenter.com it has anything about everything here!|`|Cxdxo393aa	you will be able to hear heartbeat but most doctors refuse to even look for the sex until 18 weeks and they prefer to do it at 20.  i know im 12 weeks and its killing me already!!! also no honey, you are not showing at 9 weeks, the baby hasnt even moved up over your pelvic bone until 12 weeks and at that point you cant even see anything.  usually start to show around 16 weeks if you look very very carefully.  usually obviously showing by 20 weeks.|`|yrF1q1mdaa	I've heard of some people being told at 12-13 weeks but that seems to risky to go off of. MOST babies you can find out the gender from 16 weeks and on as long as they cooperate. I found out at 17 weeks and my boy was VERY visible and had his legs spread wide open, lol.|`|CKnHMYHnaa	I found out the sex of my triplets at 13 weeks and 3 days along.  So, all those who say it must be 16-17 weeks before you can know the sex a wrong. I depends on the intensity of the u/s machine though and the experience of the technician.|`|OhSu11W6aa	sex NO!! heartbeat YEAH!!! <br>  the link below put in your last cycle date and it will pull up a daily calendar it is fun to look at!!!! also a good book i took every place with me when i was preg with first is what to expect when you are expecting it is a great book.|`|YiDhb60Paa	This is most commonly done between the 18th and 26th weeks of the pregnancy, but some newer ultrasound technology can determine the baby’s gender as early as 12 or 13 weeks.|`|ECPdAeHQaa	No, you can not possibly tell until you are 15 weeks. At your second visit you may be able to tell. <br>  <br>  I am very impatient as well but hang in there! :)

AA10196172	Usually contraception is pretty effective, but nothing is 100%. There are the occasional failures.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry unless you have several of the symptoms.<br>  <br>  If it will set your mind at ease, take a home test.|`|M3x0quJsaa	ive got it. i felt like that for a while got a get a pregnancy test and you will soon learn how to differentiate between pregnancy pains and side effects|`|Luvdkr16aa	Its 99% effective as a contraceptive.<br>  I had one for 3 years before I got it taken out and never had any problems with it, and had unprotected sex contiouously with the rod for a 3 year period.<br>  <br>  Some people stop having periods when the first get a rod put in and this is noramal.<br>  <br>  id say chances are very very slim! but if in doubt talk to the dr!!!|`|61wXpXVxaa	Yes you can be pregnant, take a test and see your doctor.|`|cQb2vqDcaa	Yes, no form of contraception is 100% effective.|`|zz4J1PcSaa	yes I am prego and i was on the shot when it happen|`|zIxfbHc2aa	yes it can happen but it is very unlikly.i  think there might be like a 0.5 chance of you being pregnant.if you have the rod in it can sometimes cause stomach aches as i experienced last week when i had severe stomach cramps. im quite sure that you are not pregnant but if your that unsure go and take a test or see your docter.
qahWKWmuaa	elevate your feet and have your husband or boyfriend give you a nice massage it helps a lot and it feels great|`|kv8ZFPP1aa	elevate your feet.|`|AA11222790	My doctor told me some women are more prone to water retention.  I am one of those women.  I have only one pair of shoes that fit me right now.  I can't even zip them up all the way.  I wish it were summer spring so I could wear flip-flops.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, my doc told me to wear compression tights/stockings...you can get compression stockings online or your local hospital.  Just to warn you they can be expensive.  I haven't done it yet because I've used the other suggestions she offered to me instead.  She said elevate my feet and DON'T wear socks to bed.  Try not to wear socks as much as possible.<br>  <br>  Here is a website for compression stockings:  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thelaserveincenter.com/w3040mmhg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thelaserveincenter.com/w3040m...</a>
kv8ZFPP1aa	i started feeling him about 24 wks. and now i can't get him to stop lol and i only have 3 weeks left.|`|3X0t8JrXaa	I'm starting to feel light kicks now at 19 weeks :-)  I'm pretty small (90 pounds).|`|hoX7hoINaa	I felt little bubbles (kinda like the carbonation in soda) at 17 weeks and actually felt light kicks around 20-21 weeks|`|UJHKyg7kaa	There was a smiliar answer this morning. Everyone says 18 to 20 weeks you should start feeling the baby(s), that is the average, but thats feeling on the outside. Some women say that you can feel the baby ay 13 weeks, some say 22-24 weeks.<br>  <br>  Butterfly kicks, the very light ones, are around 15-18 weeks I would say, that you yourself only feel.<br>  <br>  If you dont feel the baby by 20-22weeks I would suggest seeing a doctor to make sure everything is okay.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the Baby!|`|AA11222790	I felt my baby around 16 weeks.  Typically movement starts around 18-21 weeks.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Usually between 18 and 22 weeks.|`|qahWKWmuaa	Well it all depends if this is your first pregnancy. If it is, then it is always harder for you to feel the baby. with my first i felt then around 18 weeks but they were very light my husband felt then around 21 weeks that when the baby started getting really active|`|532XA7lkaa	I'm a second time mom a little over 15 weeks and I have felt the baby move already.  I remember from last time so well, so I think I recognized it early.  It's too small to actually "kick" so you can feel yet....I felt more of a rolling sensation the baby did...so I would say I flt movement.  First time around I didn't notice until over 20 weeks though.|`|otFCWMuUaa	layin your hand on your belly and feeling them can take a bit longer then the actual kicks itself.. you yourself will feel them around 20-23 weeks id say from the inside.. the outside ones probly around 24-26 but babies are notorious for running from hands lol|`|jd4MzIYtaa	i believe that is around 22-24 weeks along<br>  butterfly kicks are around 15-17 weeks|`|Ccq8zEcnaa	Those you will likely feel really definite around 20-24 weeks. I actually started to see my baby roll and kick at about 30 weeks.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	i felt my baby kick at 15 weeks and i started to see her move at 24 weeks ... every person is different.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	So you want to know when someone can touch your belly and feel RIGHT? Um I was around 6 months I think!|`|ybexjS2Paa	With the first one I was about 20-21 weeks, with the second around 16th week.|`|ITn1W6iFaa	I'm due any day with my first and I was lucky enough to start feeling her move around 15 weeks. By 20 weeks not only could she be felt on the outside but I was able to see my belly move, and she hasn't stopped since. I hope you start feeling it soon, it really is the coolest part of pregnancy I think. Congrats!|`|xX0zKzw8aa	My husband could feel baby moving at 19 weeks when I was lying on my back at night.  Hope that helps.|`|sS0uDgz0aa	I am 24 weeks and i felt mine around 20 weeks maybe a little later. Good luck!!!|`|u5MMhrfOaa	I felt my baby kick at about 20 weeks.
AA11065140	I did, but not anymore.  And no, I don't feel guilty at all...in fact, quite the opposite.  I would feel guilty if I allowed that former friend to think it's okay to attack her son with a closed fist.  I would feel guilty if I allowed that other former friend to think it's okay to smoke pot in front of her toddler.  But both have heard my opinion, and know that the reason I'm not friends with them anymore is because I can't support their poor parenting choices.|`|AA11347204	I have a friend that never takes care of her child. Shes here visiting her parents and shes been here a while and her parents are constantly taking care of him hes like 6 months and shes always gone or just like here Im leaving. I wonder what she will do when she goes home LOL|`|UdtzY5ciaa	I am far from perfect and make plenty of mistakes in parenting.  I try to be reasonable about it, but there are plenty of times I think someone I know is doing a terrible job parenting.  I've never felt guilty afterwards.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	There are parents I know who make different decisions than I do, let's put it that way. I try not to judge, but it's really impossible not to compare yourself and ideas with someone else. That's just what we do as humans.|`|ANHsv4ENaa	I don't feel badly for judging other people who are not good parents. If I have common sense and they don't or if I have compassion and they don't or if I just have better parenting skills why can't I judge? I know two people who I think are not good parents and I see how they are emotionally and mentally hurting their kids. I'd be blind not to. Why should I pretend to think it's ok? It's not ok. I have every right to look at what they are doing and think, "Wow, you kinda suck."|`|4gZYucHMaa	I don't actually bc I know people would shake their head at how I parent. You have to do what is right for your family and that's individual.<br>  <br>  Maybe that child loves going over night so your gf doesn't mind.<br>  <br>  I have a friend like that, her daughter loves when her mom goes out and leaves her with friends/family.<br>  <br>  Myself I haven't left my kids ever in 7 yrs, so imagine some of the things I get said to me. so you see I have no room to judge others for what works for them, that does not work for myself.
bMyq2nOTaa	That doesn't sound like a daycare; it sounds like a nightmare! Yes, I would report it... At her age, I'm sorry, it's just not safe... At the very least, she needs help.|`|iWrXIWcPaa	your questions makes me wonder what daycare you are speaking of. my chlid attended a daycare of similar circumstances. however the 70 year old was not the primary care provider for the infants, she is more of an assistant in the infant room. plus i'm pretty sure she knows the infants names. in your case i think its cause for concern that the woman doesnt know the names of the children. that can cause all sorts of problems such as thinking she fed and changed one child and charting it under a different childs name. i would think that if the state came in they might notice some things that dont make sense and that would be very bad for any daycare. i think you should speak with the director, even if they are mother/daughter, a daycare is a business and that director needs to be aware of that situation so the business can be run efficiently. if the director takes no action, i would call the state.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	yes if she can't remember the kids names there is something wrong.  our daycare lady is 55 and i swear she is more active then i am.  She needs to be reported, because if she can't remember your child's name whats not to say that she will forget about the stove being on, or something like that.|`|AA11347204	Well I would probably say something to the director. And if my kid came home nasty and hurt and she didnt remember I wouldnt have my kid there after that.|`|64OsCr8laa	if the department saw her fit then she is fit if you dont like her just dont take your kids there|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I wouldn't leave my child at a daycare where the only worker couldn't remember my kid's name. I'd just change daycares.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	I see no problem with it, if she can take care of them.  I know a 70 year old about who is fantastic shape, I wish I had half the energy as her.  If you don't like it then, don't go there.<br>  <br>  Edit: If the additional detail to it is what it happening then, you left out a crucial part to it. Yes, if that is happening I would think so, but all you said is she can't remember the names.  If you work with a bunch of babies all the time it is sometimes hard to remember names.|`|wZAeBisbaa	Kids get dirty at daycare or at home, so that part wouldn't concern me unless it was unhealthy.  But if she can't remember things and doesn't take note of bumps or bruises, that's a danger to the children.  Age should not have any bearing on this - the issue is whether she can take proper care of the children.   I would approach the director first and say that I was concerned about some things that I had noticed.  If that didn't get any response, then I would report it.|`|9IFF0vIoaa	I wouldn't leave my kids with my grandparents...they are 70+...they are still healthy & sharp, but they couldn't run after them if they were headed for trouble, and my grandmother isn't allowed to pick up anything heavier than about 20 pounds.  But I do know people in their late years that do not have these issues that would be okay.<br>  <br>  If you are uncomfortable with the care being given to your child, you could say something to the director, like..."I realize so-and-so helps with the kids, but I would prefer that she NOT care for my child, please."  There isn't really a way for you to know if she is following your directions of course.  You could also look for another day care.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	i would ask to sit in one day and observe her ...and then surprise them with a drop by for lunch and again observe if i wasnt happy....i would approach the director with my concerns first and if i seen no improvements would take it further.|`|UdtzY5ciaa	I would definitely report them.  This doesn't seem like a safe environment.
vBahPYJGaa	he probably didn't think you would take it that way|`|AjqO1aJgaa	That's pathetic.<br>  <br>  I'd have made a lot more fun of you than that. You're 17, not 4. And you don't learn things in school to pass tests, you learn them for the future.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	Like your teacher I would be very amazed.  He shouldn't make fun of you but he should have taught you how.  With your attitude, however, that might have been an exercise in futility.|`|NQIKCGgfaa	Ummm well that definetly was not a nice reaction but I guess he was really shocked that you don't know how to measure. First of all there is no math involved in measuring since the ruler does it all on its own.<br>  <br>  So I too, would question how you made it as far without common sense.<br>  <br>  That said he should have handled things differently. Put you aside and tell you face to face instead of humiliating you in front of the class. NO ONE has the right to do that.|`|X9JSlC6Iaa	No he didn't have the right to make fun of you. No one does. You need to tell another teacher or the principal. I'm sorry this happened to you...maybe take another class that doesn't involve measuring?<br>  good luck|`|AA12305061	There is no math really in using a ruler....<br>  <br>  That's kinda funny though.....<br>  <br>  He wasn't really making fun of you....<br>  it's a natural reaction|`|8CvWbN5Caa	haha aww that terrible! It depends on the way he was saying it though. if he was just teasing then yeahh its fine lol. but if he was really trying to make you feel bad than no way! his job it to teach...|`|Grb85RJuaa	Yes, his job is to make you learn and I bet you made sure how to use a ruler after he did that. There's no math involved in using a ruler. LOL|`|5c3dc6072eed79627d5d1cf62b2bbfb5aa	Reading a ruler is a valuable skill that you will likely use on your job, in your hobbies, and in your personal every day life. Without measuring devices like rulers, and people that can read them, we would still be living in caves.<br>  <br>  The standard English ruler, or Imperial ruler, is divided into inches. Each inch is divided in half. Each of those halves is divided in half to give you quarters. Each of those quarters is divided in half to give you eighths. And each of those eighths are divided in half to give you sixteenths. Some rulers will even show you thirty-seconds and sixty-fourths. You can use the optional "Increment Leve" to learn the larger marks before graduating to the smaller marks. If you use The Ruler Game to learn to read down to sixteenths, you will have no problem reading thirty-seconds and sixty-fourths if you ever need to. For more information, see How Do I Read a Ruler? at OnlineConversion.com. <br>  <br>  Although you are probably familiar with rulers, yard sticks, tape rules, folding rules, and tape measures, you will also find rulers on many machines that you use such as saws, sewing machines, photocopiers, and computer scanners. Computer programs like Microsoft Word and Adobe PhotoShop have electronic rulers that you can turn on to help you with the exact placement of items. As you can tell, reading a ruler is a valuable skill that you will use almost every day both on and off the job. Measurement is just one reason to learn fractions. <br>  <br>  While The Ruler Game only teaches you how to read the standard English Ruler, or Imperial ruler, there are also Metric rulers. Metric rulers use marks called centimeters which are divided into 10 sections called millimeters. To read a metric ruler you simply count the sections. There is no need to convert the fractions as you must do when using English units or Imperial units. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rsinnovative.com/rulergame/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rsinnovative.com/rulergame/in...</a>|`|Ms8b2kISaa	He definitely didn't have the right to make fun of you in front of everyone like that, and if I were you, I would report it to the dean or prinicipal. I am awful at math too, and I absolutely hate it. I'm 24 now, and I took the placement tests for a community college when I was 18, and my math scores were so low, they told me I would have to take 5 semesters of math before the classes would start counting towards college credits! It was ridiculous. Some people are just better with other subjects. I like photography, too, as well as the sciences and other arts and music. But math is not my thing. I can measure with rulers and tape measures and stuff, but I'm really bad at like, estimating measurements, or trying to picture how big something is. I almost have to DEPEND on a ruler because I'm so bad at it! Don't feel bad at all! And report him! I would! Good luck and keep trying hard in school!

Classic yet modern.<br>  <br>  Anna Michelle- Anna Nicole comes to mind. Two very nice names, though! But I don't think they should be used together in this way. Maybe Michelle Anna?<br>  <br>  Stacie/Amy Elliot- Does the Elliot have a special meaning to you? Is it the last name? Stacie and Amy are very cute, but they may be a bit 1970-80's. Not that that's a bad thing- you wouldn't want the name to scream "I was born in 2009 and my mom liked trendy names!" either. Dont take this as if I don't like them: I do. They are very pretty and gender-specific.<br>  <br>  boys:<br>  Keegan Mitchell- I've never been a fan of Keegan (sorry. Honesty.) Mitchell sure is strong and manly though!<br>  <br>  Caleb Noah- Noah is one of my total favorites! I love it.<br>  <br>  Ryan Bronson- Ryan is fantastic! Another one of my faves!<br>  <br>  Tyler Liam- I love both names. Liam is somewhat exotic sounding!<br>  <br>  Great choices!|`|mbfXOPRXaa	Charlotte Reann <br>  and<br>  Tyler Liam or Caleb Noah<br>  <br>  Anna Michelle seems too common<br>  Stacie/Amy Elliot-I like Elliot for a boy and I never cared for either Stacie or Amy.<br>  <br>  Keegan Mitchell-Like Mitchell, Hate Keegan<br>  Ryan Bronson-Ryan is too common, Bronson is bad.|`|k8pFvtMLaa	I like Charlotte Michelle, Keegan Mitchell, Caleb Mitchell, Tyler Liam, Tyler Noah, Ryan Tyler, Liam Tyler.

b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	There might be a greater chance but no not likely. If he needs it it will be because he would have needed it no matter what. I was formula feed with no problems and my hubby was formula feed and had a hernia before 6 months of age (dont know why MIL is a drinker) My son had issues BF from me and then when we went to one formula he was fussy from gas and trying to poop. we switched to gentle ease and he has been better. But there is a good probability I had the same issues cause things were different back then. My son is following my steps in low weight I never made the charts till almost middle school.|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	not necessarily.  have you considered breastfeeding? it really is much easier for them to digest.  less chance of allergies.  they get your antibodies.  and what you do for them for even 6 months will last them the rest of their life.  i wasn't able to breastfeed right off the bat, he didn't latch right.  i had to pump for the first three months and then i was able to, he just started doing it properly.  most insurance companies pay for most of the pump because they see it as a preventative measure for the baby's health.|`|113FoyMFaa	intestinal problems?  you probably had that because of the formula.  why plan on giving formula in the first place?  it's a substitute.|`|qjDxKXENaa	no... every baby is different.|`|HGj1YNa2aa	If you don't mind my asking, why aren't you breast feeding? That is so superior to any formula. No matter what anyone tells you, it is actually very rare to be unable to breast feed. That problem has been "bred" out of us over the centuries because for the most part, if women could not breast feed, their babies died and the "genetic" inability to breast feed died with them.<br>  <br>  Sometimes it is hard to learn the correct way of breast feeding but almost all birthing units in hospitals have nurses who specialize in "teaching" it. Besides, these days who can trust formula with imports from China containing melamine etc.?<br>  <br>  But, I seriously doubt that genetically speaking, you will pass on a gene for soy formula only to your baby. Speak to your doctor and contact the La Leche league. They will help you too. <br>  <br>  Are you due to have a baby? If so, congratulations and good luck!|`|9903428fd2015f9ab08d494eda08819caa	Every baby is different.  Besides, formulas are always changing.  What was available for your parents is vastly different than what is available today for you and your little one.|`|Ov5kGTjZaa	not necessarily, but it is possible. my sisters and i were all on soy, and then our children have had to be on it too.|`|iqphJbkfaa	If your baby is a boy I personally would never give him soy because soy increases the amount of female hormones.<br>  <br>  My kid's not going to be a ******.|`|mAxChwHTaa	every baby is different... you will see..|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Not necessarily. But I had to have soy because of a milk allergy (although this was with formula, not breastmilk) because of rash issues and my daughter ended up having a milk protein allergy too (I was breastfeeding). However, I continued nursing her after changing my diet and she did grow out of the allergy before a year. <br>  <br>  There are tons more types of formula on the market now than when we were babies; I wouldn't worry. Your choices aren't as limited as they used to be.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	I sure hope not, our diets are soo packed with hormones as americans that we don't need soy.  Soy is good for asian countries because they generally eat healthier.
11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Well you are swelling in there preparing for your baby and yes there will be pressure of having to pee.  Didn't you ever notice that maybe you peed more on your period then when you were off of it?  Same type of thing going on here.  Expect it to get worse though.  It will depend on how you carry your child.  If you carry your baby low then expect to go often!|`|XevKV6XOaa	Im fairly lucky, as i am 36 weeks pregnant and not once throughout my pregnancy have i had the need to pee more than normal. Except when the baby kicks my bladder and i need to pee for that split second but it goes away. So i feel bad for you it would drive me nuts having to pee through the night.|`|532XA7lkaa	I thought the same thing both pregnancies...I noticed it immediately around 7-8 weeks....I guess it's normal.|`|Kx6ewfbyaa	i'm almost 2 months and i pee alot maybe not as much as you but more then normal....its cool trust me|`|AA12314337	heck yea. welcome to pregnancy.|`|gNUwLLTjaa	When a woman is pregnant anything is possible, your baby is probably already pushing on your bladder(:<br>  perfectly normal darling, enjoy all the pee urges and good luck
nYioXmnGaa	I found out I was pregnant with  my first and  when i told him I made spaghetti. He was wondering where my  famous home made bread was.  I said oh oh oh yeah I got a bun in the oven and like ten minutes later hes like wheres that bread of yours and I repeated I got a bun in the oven and he still did not get it ! I  had to repeat it like ten times when he finally  realized that I was pregnant . When  he found out he was  crazy !! Then when my husband found out I was pregnant with number two. I wrapped the test in a gift for Christmas and he opened   and was  so happy he knocked the Christmas tree over my husband is  very happy over things like that ! MY husband was so funny !! Ok last one I promise ! When my first son was born he was asking all of these  weird questions so when I was in the bathroom at the hospital  I walked out to see him with my brother  with tongs for a salad trying to  change the babies diaper it was hilarious!!!!!!|`|T8CR3u02aa	Well I got hit hard with the pregnancy hormones at the beginning of the 2nd trimester.....<br>  <br>  I love animals. I saw a dog standing in the middle of the road. (a small road, one lane on either side) But this was rush hour, so this rd was packed. The cars ahead of me kept swerving around something, i couldn't see what until I was right there. The cutest little bull dog was scared and frozen in the center of the lanes. I pulled over to help him. My friend was in the car with me. She asked what I thought I was going to do with the dog if I caught him. I had no idea but I'm sure it would have involved a call to my hubby pleading and begging. Anyhoo....<br>  <br>  As I get out of my car I see a guy come out of a house that is right there. He whistles for the dog to come to him. He acted as if this were just another day. Like its perfectly fine for his dog to sit in the middle of the street. Like hell that's ok!<br>  <br>  The dog runs up to him. So I yell (hormones at full blast) "You should keep your dog on a leash!"<br>  <br>  That was extremely out of character for me. I am not the sort of person to confront a guy like this. He looked like a crack head - way skinny skrawny, covered in tatoos, a cigarette in his hand...my friend freaked out when I yelled at him. His response was "What *itch?!"<br>  <br>  Then for some reason I blurted out "If he gets killed its your fault!"<br>  <br>  Then the guy starts walking over to my car. We were about 2 houses apart. Then he yells" You gdamn lesbian feminists! Get the *uck out of here!"<br>  <br>  At this point my friend is screaming get in the car!!!<br>  <br>  Then i yelled "Murderer!" out my window. He was just about close enough to touch my car and we drove off. My friend is still bringing this incident up when ever we go to Santa Cruz.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	I find it funny now but at the time not so much<br>  <br>  So i was probable 32-33 weeks along and i felt as big as a house. I ran to the grocery store to pick up a few things and parked my  car in a side lot that most people don't park in figuring that id have no problems getting in and out. So out i come of the store happy to be done with that when i see the worse thing ever. I had a mercury sable at the time and parked about 10 inches ON EACH SIDE were two huge trucks. No way to get in my car and be on my way. I had a doctor appointment i had to go to and i didnt want to be late. I ended up leaning against my car bawling my eyes out about how i couldn't get in my car. Lucky a very nice women came out and asked what was wrong. Between the gasps i explained. She smiled, took my keys and backed my car out of the spot. I was so relieved. I find it pretty funny now.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	This is a right after birth story.With my first son, I was in labor for about 7 hours and had my then boyfriend/babies father right by my side. I didn't want him to leave me, even to use the toilet. So, he diligently stayed by my side, fed me ice chips and was a great support. Right after I gave birth, the nurse went to hand our son to his dad. (Still slightly loopy fro the drugs) I said "No! He can't hold him yet! Make him sit down first, he'll drop him!" <br>  <br>  The nurse chuckled and my mom said "you let him hold his baby" to which my response was "he has to sit first, I DID NOT go through all that pain just to have him break our baby."<br>  <br>  Needless to say, he sat down. But hear me out, my husband trips over his own feet sometimes.|`|AA11920812	I was pregnant with my first. I was about 32 weeks feeling HUGE. I was also in school preparing for my finals. I`d go every morning to the bagel shop to eat and study before class. Well...there was always this HUGE man in there. Seriously, the guy pulled two chairs for his booty and hung over. Nasty. But, I paid him no attention. This is my last semester and I was graduating (woot woot).<br>  <br>  One day a few weeks later I beat him in the store. He had always been meanish and stared at me. Never moving or scooting his chair (the one reserved for his bag and coats) so I could easily get through. So, the looks at my belly had gone on for some time. And, it was like he was disgusted at me.<br>  <br>  Finally, in line, I couldn`t stand his rudeness. I turned and said, *I`m nine months pregnant whats your excuse?*<br>  <br>  Ta da.<br>  <br>  No more staring.<br>  <br>  I went to my usual table. And he to his. Nothing more was said. Or unwanted glances given. As, I was studying I heard someone come over to him and comment about his trip to Cornell for some big wig weight loss thing. I guess they have a massive program to loose weight there (someone said it was featured on Date Line). And, he went there for 6 weeks. I guess he assumed I was just *fat*.<br>  <br>  I should also add - I am not normally the type to be so bold. Usually I am quiet and shy. Never saying anything to anyone. Especially in public setttings. My hormones were just raging that first pregnancy!

It is a wonderful name. If it helps any most parents go through the same thing.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	Amelie is unique.  All the rest are very high on the pop list this year.  But Amelie isn't.  It's very pretty and seems to go with your name.  It's also the only one that has 3 syllables.  The rest have two.  Three syllables helps make the rhythm of the name interesting.<br>  <br>  Am-e-lee Lew-is<br>  El-la lew-is<br>  <br>  Enough of the rhythm lesson.

She is likely to be one of many in her class, leaving her to go by Olivia L. or Ava L. which is no fun. Ella is more of a nickname. Amelie is gorgeous and your best choice, however, I find it way to close to your name, since Aimee can be a nickname for Amelie. <br>  <br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  <br>  Ophelia Kate Lewis<br>  Ophelie Kate Lewis<br>  Adella Kate Lewis "Ella"<br>  Adélie Kate Lewis<br>  Estella Kate Lewis "Ella or Stella"|`|N8DgVu9Aaa	i've always like the name Grace so i reccomend that...its a really pretty yet sophisticated name.<br>  a really girly name is Darcy you could have something like that!<br>  <br>  but olivia is really nice so whatever you want really  <br>  <br>  you could also try:  Felicity....or is that too girly?!? but remember she can hav a nickname.

3Q9yiimsaa	I have started to feel that way now i can't drink enough ice cold water. I wouldn't worry about it though if it is water you are drinking the doctors will love it because they want to you drink a bunch of water it is good for you while you are pregnant.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	Yes I did with my 7 th child ; like you I was always thirsty ; and I ask my doctor and he just laugh and said ; well drink water as much as you can because its very healthy  for you and the baby ; and my son came into this world very healthy|`|ioZeveazaa	Its normal. As you get even farther you will crave milk alot probably. I drink like almost half a gallon a day! Your body needs the extra fluid to keep the blood pressure up at a regular level and to hydrate you and your baby and ALSO maintain enough amniotic fluid around the baby. Expect to drink atleast eight glasses of fluid a day. Good luck!|`|JQcIwPXJaa	Yes, I always seem to be thirsty my entire pregnancies! I just have to carry a huge jug of water with me everywhere I go! You just have to keep in mind that your body is doing some really hard stuff right now. Making a baby is hard work and anything your baby needs it will take from your body. That's why drinking water and taking vitamins is so important. It's more for your health than your baby's. It's not a problem, just an annoyance. =)|`|VS8mactUaa	The body is made up of 75 percent ater, and now that yoru pregnant the baby is taking alot of the liquids you drink, drink more water and milk, drinks that arent salty and give you a clean quenched thirst.|`|64OsCr8laa	im always thirsty to so i would say yes its due to the baby i use to hate hate water and always drink dr pepper i think may have about 10 glasses of water a day and maybe 1 can dr pepper every 4 days|`|kUCVLuTPaa	Someone told me they were thirsty alot during pregnancy and found out that they had diabetes..YOu should go get that checked..|`|61wXpXVxaa	Yes it's related to pregnancy. Yes I've experienced this previous to my miscarriage due to an appendix rupture last year. You are thirst because the baby is using alot of the fluid you normally drink to grow and hydrate itself, it will steal from you until it is full, and your body won't take anything in itself until the baby is full.|`|AA11208683	your body is just probably telling you that you need to drink more... drinking is very important for you and the baby during pregnancy. i would just question your doctor about it when you see them next. sometimes being thirsty can mean there is a problem but it would be accompanied by reduced urination, or no urination at all for an entire day. If you are drinking and using the bathroom your fine. but like i said just ask your doctor about it. i hope this helps... good luck!|`|UJHKyg7kaa	Its probably because you dont have enough fluids to surround the developing baby, so you are very thirsty. Once you get all of the fluids you need, you probably wont be as thirsty.<br>  <br>  I suggest drinking water as a fluid to go with anything or if your just thirsty, for a while and see if that helps!<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope I helped! :)|`|z7fCaoXbaa	I have the same problem, and I think it is normal, just your body telling you what you need.  I used to never drink water, and now I drink 6-8 big bottles a day atleast!  I keep a bottle with me at all times.  But as long as it is water you are drinking, then it is very good for you and your baby.|`|f4AJHCHKaa	You need the extra water, so thats why youre so thirsty. Just follow what your body is telling you to do!! This thirst is not going to go away, I'm 33 weeks and still get super thirsty!! <br>  <br>  Congrats and good luck!!|`|KGG783Seaa	Some of the water you normally drink goes to your baby its normal just drink more fluids.|`|AhC8y1P8aa	Maybe you need to drink more water.
2dfdfcdb4d65c895a40f81c0cb21ef17aa	In theory, since you're the mother, and she's the child, you do have the right to decide how to do her hair.<br>  <br>  In reality, though, your daughter has got to live with the hair style...and you have to live with your daughter.<br>  <br>  Sure, you want to put it in a style that may be easy for you to care for, but you also want to have a style to where she'll feel pretty. Remember, kids can sometimes be very cruel to other kids, so you don't want to set her up to be made fun of in school because of having hair that may be easy care but will make her feel unattractive or make her stand out too differently from the other kids.  I know how this feels from when I was a child and instead of being allowed to have my hair natural or in braids, I had to deal with those old-time 1950s "greasy press and curl" hair styles where a little black girl couldn't run and play like the other kids for fear her hair would revert back to its natural state and mom would whip you for "ruining" hair that cost her 1/3 of her pay check to achieve for you and two sisters. <br>  <br>  Short hair can be cute and appropriate for a young girl, and just because it's short, it doesn't have to look like a "boys" hairstyle.  There are lots of really adorable barettes and hairbands out there to dress it up with...but there are also other easy care styles just above the shoulders that are out there, too... Why not google hair styles  for little girls or children and get some ideas, or just visit a beauty salon for a consultation? <br>  <br>  Some ways to help her accept a hairstyle change?  If you do this decision together, say make a special day of it where you go to the salon, look at the style books together, let her pick out a style (within reason) and maybe go out to lunch or a movie together afterwards...she'll feel "all grown up" and perhaps accept the new hairstyle a bit more...and maybe if you're getting your hair done at the same time, that may make her feel more comfortable. Lots of salons/day spas do mother/daughter type stuff all the time and a good stylist knows how to work with children.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I just saw the picture.  Now I have very short hair and even I think that cut is extreme for a little girl. <br>  <br>  Come on, have a heart. As the mother of a daughter, I GUARANTEE that she's going to get made fun of in school having that short of hair...and if you insist on cutting it that short, it will feel more like you're punishing her for having long hair.  <br>  <br>  Please, for the sake of her self-esteem, consider keep the hair at least shoulder length and just deal with it! It's not her hairstyle that needs to be changed...it's your attitude towards it! <br>  <br>  Do you really want her to grow up with feeling of low self-worth, feeling like she's "ugly" or she can't do anything with her hair because of the messages you're sending about her hair? Well, then don't sow the seeds for that with an "I-can't-be-bothered" sort of thing.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  Now here's an idea... why not let her have the long hair, but put it in braids?|`|jdRKZe18aa	Find some cute pictures of  young girls  - celebrities or others with CUTE, pretty, girlish hair cuts.  Remember though - sometimes being short doesn't always mean easier unless she'll let you fuss with it and curl it and make it look pretty instead of just SHORT and boyish.  When my girls where little and COULDN'T manage their own hair alone having it LONG was easier to me.  I could put it up, in a braid, french braids, pony tail, pig tails....  THEN they reached an age when THEY didn't want MOM doing it anymore and I GLAD turned it over to them.  THAT was around middle school age (10-11).  THEN it was their headache xcept on rare occasions when they ASKED me to fix it special for them.<br>  <br>  THEY all (3 girls) eventually cut their pretty long hair thinking they would like it better and it would be easier and NOW they are so upset they did and WISH they had long hair again.  Face it - women are never satisfied and always want what we can't have or what we once had.... it's a circular thing I think! : )<br>  <br>  I think you shouldn't cut it if she completely DOESN'T WANT IT CUT unless you can convince her by showing her how it COULD LOOK shorter.  GIRLS grow up and hold things like this against us as mothers - try and just ENJOY being able to brush it, fuss over her for the short number of years she lets you.... SOON enough she will be a tween and won't even LIKE her parents. JUST my advice|`|SnQvsOPwaa	A lot of people cut their young girls hair just for the reasons you are stating. My daughter is 7 and her hair comes to about 4 inches from her butt. I wouldn't trade the time we spend every day brushing it out. We talk and joke and its just fun.

My daughter has very long hair, eventho i like it but it still a hassel sometimes to take care of it.

It's a disruption to schoolwork, playing, everything. <br>  <br>  I know you will cut it. It's the adrenaline. You'll want it shorter than the picture though. Shave it when she's asleep.

Go to the length of a bob (jawline length) At least that way she won't think she looks like a boy.|`|wZAeBisbaa	As her mother, I guess you have the right to make her get her hair cut.  But I personally would not do it.  Her hair is part of her body and her self-image.  For some girls, long hair is more than a fashion - it's a part of them.  One of my daugthers had hair below her waste from second grade through middle school.  I didn't like it because it was often messy and it was very hard to wash and brush. But it was important to her to keep it long, so we let her.  Eventually she learned to take care of it herself, and later she got tired of it and got it cut. At 6 years old, your daughter is not far from the age where she could do some of her own hair care.  In the meantime, pony tails and braids are a good compromise.|`|9Eebavmiaa	I honestly think she's old enough to make that decision for herself. Let her choose to cut it and how short. I just think if you do it for you...she'll hold a grudge against you for that. I would just leave it alone, let her choose to cut it if she wants. If she was younger, I'd say go for it, but she's a "girl". Not a "baby or toddler". Let her choose...

yKS2UI87aa	Call CPS just in case|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	I would ask in casual conversation how the baby is the next time you see them OR bring over dinner and look in on the child and find out. Dont say you hear the child just bring over dinner and say you were thinking of them that you would like to see the baby and see how everone is doing. Ask how things are going. If you seem to get a good things are fine.. adn not much info ask hows he sleeping and eating and if you still dont get an answer you like ask does he fuss alot. if you dont want to do that you can call CPS (child protection service) BUT you risk if its colic your nieghbors will hate you. My son was crying alot when first born cause of a bad reaction to my breast milk. Is the if the child is crying for hours and hours with no break... then I would call the cops. if it is a new born baby under 3 weeks the child should be feeding OFTEN no longer then 4 hours apart (some are feeding an hour apart) if the child cries non stop for 4 to 5 hours them might not be feeding him right... might be best to go over and dig for info before making the call BUT i would not let this go on much longer. if they are not feeding that child major health issues are gonna unfold for the baby.. keep posted!!!|`|9QVjNaIPaa	omg! are all of you people serious? jump straight to calling cps? how sad! why dont you go over there and offer some help/support. you never know what could be wrong with the baby and the mom could be battling depression. this could be really hard on her. go ask if everything is ok or if there is anything you can do. maybe she needs a break! try talking to her and find out whats going on before you just call cps with an accusation of neglect. people lose their kids that way and its very hard to get them back!|`|WThYT17Iaa	I would call CPS.

VS8mactUaa	I was 8 weeks when I miscarried, but I was having trouble from the beginning, all kinds of cramps. The doctors kept doing internal ultrasounds and they did paps on me, and one time they did an internal, and an hour later I miscarried, I was livid at the doctors they kept irritating my cervix in the midst of all the cramps I blame them, I had 12 ultra sounds in the first 8 weeks, I had 3 ultrasounds the first day I found out and one every week after I was so angry!|`|ioZeveazaa	Most miscarriages happen in the first trimester and they are because of genetic defects. This is not the mother's fault. I didn't have a miscarriage but did come close around 6 weeks when I found my baby's placenta had a tiny tear in it. Luckily my doctor caught it soon enough and put me on bed rest so that the tear could heal as the placenta matured. I am now 39 weeks and due the 7th of March. Don't worry, just let nature take its course. Good luck!!|`|S4DNQkFraa	They are most common before you're 13 weeks, every week you pass then the risk decreases, but it's even more so decreased when you hit your second trimester, at 13 weeks. However, some can miscarry at 20 weeks, medical term would be stillborn. <br>  Stress, dehydration can increase your risk as well, that's why they say to relax and drink plenty of water. In early pregnancy, like 4-10 weeks, a miscarriage is caused by the sperm and egg not meeting right, nothing can be done to prevent this from happening this early on.<br>  Signs of a miscarriage are pain, big clots and lots of blood. No matter how far along you are, you should go in to the ER asap. <br>  I had one at 4 wks, so I didn't go in. It wasn't too bad because I was only 4 wks, but it did suck and took time to heal. <br>  I'm currently pregnant, 9 wks and 6 days today and I'm due in September (25th)!! I'm excited, and believe me, I was a nervous wreck for a while, but I just took baths to help me stay relxed and stress free. It helped me allot, I also did lots of research on the net.

I was about 12 weeks, had just found out I was pg.|`|Ms8b2kISaa	I never personally had one, but I did do a lot of research on them while I was pregnant. It seems like as far as a "normal" miscarriage, normal meaning the kind you don't have to go to the doctor for any drugs or curretage after, they seem to mostly occur in the first trimester. It does happen after that of course, but when it's farther along than the first trimester, the doctor usually finds out through an ultrasound, and then has to manually remove the fetus. My mom actually had a miscarriage when she was pregnant with me. I had a twin, and when she was about 4-6 months pregnant, she had horrible pains and was bleeding everywhere. She said it was like big clots mixed with normal menstrual type blood, and that there was so much, both her and the doctor were positive she had miscarried both babies, but when they did the ultrasound to make sure, they still saw me, wiggling about with a heartbeat! Strange, I know, but I guess they are really possible in many different ways. I also had a friend who "miscarried" at almost 8 months pregnant, but by then I think it's almost considered more to be a still birth. Good luck, and I'm sure you and baby will be fine!!!|`|jd4MzIYtaa	i am 14 weeks along and i am terrified of miscarrying my baby. My mom had 3 before having me and 2 before having my sister so i freak out daily. I was having sharp cramps the first few weeks which made me worry but at 11 weeks i heard the heartbeat and the dr said the baby seemed healthy.After you hear the babies heartbeat you are pretty much in the clear.You can miscarry until 5 months though which they consider a stillborn but its still a miscarriage. My cousin was like 17 weeks along and she miscarried. This just happened in January. She was spotting for a week prior but she was still 4 months along. I do know they had trouble finding the heartbeat and had to use the ultrasound so i think she had some complications from the get go but still just relax and know everyone is different. Even if it runs in your family doesnt mean you will have one. There is no reason to stress just enjoy the pregnancy and i am sure you will be holding your beautiful child in a few months :)|`|EI2zWFUsaa	I have had 2 m/c's in the last 6 months, the first was at 10 wks, called a blighted ovum by doctor, had D&C as I was not passing it myself.  The second was at 5 weeks, started spotting the day I got a positive pregnancy test.  This one the doctor called a chemical pregnancy, my levels weren't very high so it was just like having a regular period.  Every single person is different as far a m/c goes, I personally never had any cramping, only light brown spotting with both.  Good luck to you, every week is closer to the goal!|`|61wXpXVxaa	10 weeks, and I ruptured my appendix and had to have emergency surgery.|`|fKhjdqCGaa	I miscarried twice right at about 5 weeks.

8pIGQdybaa	You certainly have the symptoms of pregnancy, although I've heard that in rare occasions, they can be psychosomatic. A month and a half and no period, though. If tomorrow's test doesn't turn up positive, I might be tempted to see if the doctor could run an ultrasound just to check everything out. I'm not sure if a tubal pregnancy would turn up in a urine test...just a thought? I hope everything turns out well for you.|`|NqFPyhpsaa	If your period is still not here from a Jan 11 due date, then you probablly are pregnant. The symptoms do sound like it, especially the tired alot part. Also, if you are peeing more than normal, thats another symptom. Just try to relax, and take the tests tomorrow and hopefully you will get good news. But signs are pointing to yes!

n3PE2lvDaa	wow I am completly with you on that one. i would definatly not want my daughter going to her house. especially with the cigarrete smoking inside and the boyfriend that gets stoned. i would not want to have my baby taken care of when a man (who I bet you guys probably dont even know very well) is also there getting high.<br>  my MIL is lovely but I still prefer for her to come to our house to babysit just because our daughter is very active and my mil's house is not baby proof. She has alot of potplants everywhere which my daughter trys to eat when ever she is there and the whole house is a disaster area for a 9 month old that gets into everything. so I like her to come to our baby friendly house to babysit so that I feel easier about leaving her. My mil is lovely and understands this and has no problem comming to our house. She is just stoked she gets to watch her and she understands that when my daughter is out of the eat-everything-she-finds stage she will be able to stay at grandmas more often. <br>  How sad your babies grandma is not so understanding. her loss. sounds like she is being a child over this|`|Xc02z608aa	Don't take your baby to a place that you deem unsafe just to appease your MIL.  She can either come around and be a part of her granddaughters life or she can continue to pout.  Stand your ground.|`|qjDxKXENaa	i would never take my baby in a place like that... NEVER|`|FTFd3AQAaa	well i cant say for sure whether she will "come around" or not but i really think you should continue to not allow your daughter to go to her house, it just doesnt sound healthy or safe... it will be sad is your MIL wont come to your house to see her grandchild but i that would be her selfish choice... where your decision was made for the sake of your child|`|9QVjNaIPaa	if thats the kind of person she is i wouldnt let her watch my child period!|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	I think it is a bit of spazzing on both sides here.<br>  <br>  First of all, as a parent, of course your are going to be super protective over your child and the environment that he/she will be placed in.  No arguments there.<br>  <br>  However, you guys are the ones "asking" her to do you the favor of babysitting...perhaps that would not be the best time to tell her how you and your spouse don't feel like she is a good mother, and that her homelife is not acceptable to you.  Sure, your MIL may have over reacted, but she is understandably upset.<br>  <br>  MILs are people too.  They make mistakes, and are entitled to live life the way they see fit.  If you feel uncomfortable taking your child into her home, find a good time to have a heart to heart with her, and to discuss the things that have you concerned.  <br>  <br>  Lets be mature, and handle this like an adult.|`|9903428fd2015f9ab08d494eda08819caa	I'd keep the rule that she can come over to visit and call it at that.<br>  <br>  Obviously she doesn't seem too interested in developing a lasting relationship with you or your child.<br>  <br>  I agree with your stance and I would say hold firm.|`|e5521545db99d7f3045bc534013f517caa	She is WAY overreacting.  What you need to emphasize is that the health of your daughter is the most important thing.  You aren't trying to be mean or spiteful.  Your daughter has breathing issues and being around even remnants of smoke can cause problems.  Next time you get to talk to her, remind her that you aren't being mean.  You are trying to look out for your daughter's well being and if she even cares an inkling about her granddaughter, she will cease this childish behavior and when she comes over, abide by your rules.  Her attitude should change quickly.  Everything else is secondary compared to the health of your baby.  In fact, don't even bring it up unless she does.  My MIL is a heavy smoker.  She tries very hard not to even smoke around my daughters.  Fortunately, neither of my daughters have breathing problems but she knows that when she is at our apartment, she steps outside to smoke.  When they are at her house, I can't tell her not to smoke but she is to try and keep it away from the girls because she cares about them.  Just remind her that her smoking will hurt your daughter.  I hope that helps.|`|q4rG5Dwtaa	I would not take my children around someone that is that unstable, drinking, smoking, wild parties, she sounds crazy. I would even be scared to let her watch the baby by herself. If she wants to come to your house and visit with the baby while you and your husband are there, that would be fine. But not by herself. She sounds nuts.|`|zATQaiwIaa	I would not feel bad at all!!!!!!!!!!!  The woman sounds like she still believes and will always believe she is number one.  Do you really want your daughter to pick up anything from her grandmother? - ie habits and nasty words....?<br>  <br>  When your MIL can clean up her act Im sure you will be more than happy to see your daughter and her interact - but until then just dont go out of your way to see her.  Just keep your door open for her to come visit.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	well u are deff in the right here <br>  my boyfriends mom is the same way <br>  smokes in the house <br>  complains <br>  liar <br>  pot head <br>  the whole house is drugs <br>  <br>  and i would never leave my son alone up there even if his dad was there <br>  that is to risky of a situation <br>  o and my MIL thinks all babies should sleep on there tummy so they dont get flat spots or a bald spot <br>  big nono in my parenting beliefs <br>   i to have never make her feel like she was not welcome here <br>  but they still complain <br>  that is not an apporatite place to have a baby <br>  if the cops came you could have your child taken away from you because she was around people doing drugs even if it was not you <br>  <br>  dont go over there wait until she comes to u she has to relize she was in the wrong and if she really loves her grand daughter she will|`|be3e5b583c027426a0f22b62804479f0aa	sorry, but i wouldn't bring my child around that...

3Q9yiimsaa	You should be able to hear your babies heart beat around 11 weeks with a Doppler in the doctors office if you were not able to hear it at 15 weeks i would ask the doctor for a ultrasound to make sure that everything is ok.|`|7AYnWg3paa	NOT REALLY....NO....MAYBE A WIERD POSITION THO|`|JQcIwPXJaa	I couldn't hear my daughter's heart beat until 16 weeks (with a doppler). And now with my second daughter I heard it at 9 weeks for a second and then at my 13 week appt they couldn't hear it again. I had an u/s, but everything was fine. Sometimes when they are so small if they move to just the right spot you won't be able to hear it. I wouldn't worry about it. I know it's hard not to, but just ask for an u/s to double check or you could purchase a doppler from Babiesrus for $30 and then you can hear it whenever you like! =)|`|gEWt6eoCaa	I didn't hear mine until I got my 1st ultrasound done, which was at 12 weeks. even after that the doctor still couldn't find it until I was about 15 weeks.

I had surgery years ago and I have this tiny scar inside my belly button that you can't see. Not im 15 weeks pregnant and im starting to show...you can see my scar plain as day with all the expansion. You will feel pains all over. As long as they aren't unbearable or last for long periods of time you can pretty much write em off as growing pains. If theres something that just seems so bad you know its not right then call your dr.|`|S4DNQkFraa	I'll be 10 weeks tomorrow. Mine doesn't hurt at all. You should talk about it with your doc though, not that anything is wrong, but something is up. G/L! Congrats!|`|hoX7hoINaa	I had that throughout the majority of my pregnancy.

wvGv8WQ6aa	i had a m/c 1-6-09 and i am now 7weeks 4 days pregnant and everything looks great. do what you want! my doctor told me to wait 3 months but i didn't and everything is going good... PLUS YOUR MORE FERTILE RIGHT NOW|`|CIZjK2rAaa	I started trying 2 weeks after my miscarriage and BOOM!  Got pregnant right away.  I am now 17 weeks 3 days.|`|QFNvYVtyaa	I am deeply sorry for your wonderful loss.I too experienced a miscarriage three years ago.It is not easy.When is it safe to try again? This is one of the most common questions couples face after a miscarriage. While some not ready to think about trying again for a long while, others find comfort in continuing to try to conceive again without delay -- especially those couples who were already trying to get pregnant. Either reaction is perfectly normal.<br>  <br>  If you are one of those who are anxious to try again right away, it can be difficult to get a straight answer on when it's safe to keep trying. Ask three different doctors and you'll likely get three different answers...likely the following:<br>  <br>  Three to six months<br>  <br>  This is the most common response. Being the traditional, by-the-book answer, some doctors will often give this advice for all patients following a miscarriage without adjusting it to suit individual circumstances. In some cases, it may make sense to wait for a few months after a loss. If the pregnancy was further along, it could be that your body does need some time to replenish lost nutrients. If you had a D&C, your doctor may feel it's best to wait in order to be sure your uterine lining properly replenishes itself.<br>  <br>  However, in cases such as a very early "chemical" pregnancy or a loss at 5-6 weeks, it is hard to make a case that the body truly needs three months to recover when in many of these cases, a woman might not even know she had miscarried if she was not actively trying for a baby at that point.<br>  <br>  After your first normal period<br>  <br>  Some doctors feel it is safe to try again without a long waiting period after a loss, but they recommend waiting one cycle for the first normal menstrual period. The reasoning behind this is that they have an easier time dating a pregnancy with a last menstrual period as a reference. Since ovulation may not occur on a normal schedule after bleeding from a miscarriage, they feel waiting for a normal period will help date a pregnancy should it occur right away.<br>  <br>  Right away...if you feel ready<br>  <br>  Some doctors believe that, for most women, there is no medical reason to wait at all. According to this school of thought, once the bleeding ceases, it's fine to continue trying. These doctors do not worry overly about the problem of dating the pregnancy since ultrasound can be used if the dates are uncertain.<br>  <br>  How to know what to do<br>  <br>  Obviously, it is best to have your doctor's stamp of approval on your plans to try again, since you will need to seek prenatal care when you do get pregnant again. If your doctor recommends a long wait and you prefer not to wait, ask for a thorough explanation on why he or she is recommending that course of action. Find out if there are specific reasons in your medical situation why your doctor feels it is best to wait. If there are no specific reasons, ask if your doctor feels there is any major risk to trying again right away. Often, the answer may be no.<br>  <br>  Be sure to give yourself the time you need to grieve, however. Do not discount your feelings of loss, and be sure to examine whether you really do need some time before jumping back into the ups and downs of trying to conceive. No matter what any doctor says about your physical readiness, only you and your partner truly know how long you need before you are emotionally ready.|`|0mZfOStiaa	I would wait a good two months.<br>  I'm very sorry that happened.<br>  Just take it to God. He will help you and let you know when it is time for your baby to take on the challenges of this world. Good luck sweetie!
OgzHcNMsaa	No one knows what your baby will look like. Genes are a strange thing. I've seen black and white couples with kids that look full black, full white or a range of mixes in between. One egg carries a whole different set of features from the other so your next child could possibly not even look anything like the first. Just wait and see...it will be beautiful regardless.|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	Your baby will most likely have dark skin (but lighter then the father), black hair, and brown eyes. African American genetics are usually dominant over Italian and Irish genetics. You won't know until you have him or her but congratulations!!<br>  <br>  Have you seen that couple that had two sets of twins? The mom is white and the dad is black and in each set they had one baby that looked completely white and one baby that looked completely black. It's pretty crazy.|`|B8YL6up4aa	Why the worry,anyway it all depends on which gene is dominant and which is recessive.|`|qjDxKXENaa	your baby will have tanned skin colour. 90% chance of dark eyes and hair. but very pretty boy/girl.<br>  <br>  congratulations..

If you push out all the air, you don't have to worry so much about keeping the bottle tilted so that the baby is sucking in the milk rather than the air inside the liner.<br>  <br>  I thought the best thing about the drop in liners was that there was absolutely no vacuum created inside the bottle by the baby's sucking.|`|9903428fd2015f9ab08d494eda08819caa	I'm not sure how folks are taking the air out.  As the baby drinks the bag collapses on its own reducing the amount of air your baby gulps.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure it, being people manually extracting air, is prevalant.  The statement on the website may just be a marketing statement.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, how would you extract air out of the drop in?  and if you could, could you imagine the poor parents doing it every feeding?

Then even after the child is grown parents umbilical cord is not cut.  The answer is, to much!|`|vX2O4v7haa	to raise an infant from birth until age 21, on average it will cost the parents over $250,000|`|RiQA4Epraa	how much does it cost to HAVE one <br>  or take care of one?<br>  <br>  at LEAST 200,000 bucks|`|b0qKOoBRaa	That's a very complicated calculation.  Are you asking just how much the hospital bills would be?  Because you have to see the doctor quite often for nine months, then there's the birth and whatever may happen consequently, and then you have at LEAST 18 years of related expenses (food, clothing, entertainment, COLLEGE) to think about... A lot of the initial cost depends on whether you have good health insurance and family or friends who can hand down things like cribs and strollers, blankets, clothing, etc.<br>  <br>  There are online calculators that can help you roughly estimate the cost of having a child, try googling it.  BUT, if you need to post a question on Y!A to get this info, maybe the project is a little ambitious.  Make sure you talk to you teacher about HOW you should go about finding this information.  I'm sure he/she can offer some great suggestions that won't be as time consuming as prowling the internet can be.  At least they could give a good starting point. :)  Good luck.|`|771bFixmaa	If you go on babycenter.com they have a baby cost calculator and you can go through and add up the things you need.

ybexjS2Paa	Food poisoning can be very dangerous to your baby. I'd contact your doctor if I were you.

It will not harm your baby if undercooked. My mom always chops up some mint leaves and garnishes the dal with it because it helps with the gas. Thats all you have... gas. If you cant take pepto, try the mint. It will help.|`|FH2iKFcJaa	Pregnant woman are not supposed to eat anything raw.

28756075c430d522980cb3972916ccd5aa	She probably doesn't need one any more so don't push her too much, you're just stressing her and yourself out<br>  . Some kids stop needing naps at this age.|`|VHHis05Naa	Have you tried using a timer?  We set a timer and tell our daughter, "When this goes off, it's naptime".  She jumps right up and walks herself to her room when it goes off.  We have had a lot of trouble getting her to nap and go to sleep at night, but for some reason is ok with the timer.  Maybe it's that it's something she can see and it's not just Mom and Dad telling her to do something.  She's napping right now after having the timer set.  <br>  <br>  Give it a try and see what happens.  Be firm and matter-of-fact about it.  "I am going to set this time now, and when it goes off it's bedtime/naptime."  Try that for a week and be consistent.  Good luck!|`|kprKXEOSaa	You can't force someone to sleep.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	she sounds like she has outgrown nap time.  When my son turned 3 he did too.  I made him have "rest time"  I emphasize that he did not have to sleep.  Just lay in his bed for 30 minutes.  He could read books but nothing else.  It seemed to work.  If he got cranky later in the day, I would put him to bed earlier.  Usually around 7:30pm  He would sleep through the night and wake up refreshed.|`|wxImZRssaa	My daughter stopped having afternoon naps about 4 months ago. She's only 2. They just stop needing them.|`|AA11347204	You cant make her sleep. Id say shes at the age where they stop napping. Sorry.
xWfrA3vqaa	If you think about it a lot during the day, that's probably why. <br>  It's normal for teens to dream about sex.|`|aOCfLAJJaa	Because you've seen something that has sex in it/you've read something, basically, you've seen/heard something in recent history about sex. Your mind pushes it to the top of it's priorities when you sleeping for some reason, and you dream about it.|`|GxQyvrv4aa	It's normal<br>  even if you are the purest of the pure<br>  you will still have these dreams<br>  why?<br>  because organisms are made to reproduce<br>  it's one of the first principles of evolution|`|SNrNiWgJaa	horomones<br>  <br>  aww man now i'm gonna have a dream about sex.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	horomones.<br>  as long as u arnt doing it. your fine.|`|66fMJo6raa	your hormones are out of control|`|7f065a5f8c99309ffaeba42afcaa6331aa	because ur normal
UrToN7Ngaa	idk.. but what would happen if you relaxed your muscles too much and the baby just plop.. slipped out!! that would be horrible!!!  you should be careful, mom!!! <br>  <br>  lol.. i really hope this doesn't give you nightmares, i just couldn't resist saying that! I researched it a bit and found that there is not enough research to say for sure whether or not it is effecting your child (especially because you didn't mention the brand). I know doctor visits are costly, but i would be totally worth it to stop in and ask the doctor. I wouldn't suggest taking any more until after the doctor visit. --- maybe you can get someone to massage your muscle pain (?)|`|ioZeveazaa	I wouldn't take them. If you are taking them because of your pregnancy then switch to Tylenol. Pregnancy is painful, yes but for your baby's sake just grin and bear it. Talk to your doctor. Good luck!|`|uCnmYEPBaa	I was having such severe hip pain that my doc put me on muscle relaxers.  I only took it two times before bed and I haven't felt comfortable taking it again.<br>  I'm considering chiropractic treatment for the pain instead.<br>  Or just doing nothing and waiting out this last 9 weeks.|`|es8CfccCaa	Of course it does. It's the same as drinking alcohol. <br>  If your relaxed, think how much more your baby is. No Good.<br>  Whatever you drink, eat, or breath in, so does your baby<br>  I'm sure that the relaxants are not prescribed<br>  -  muscle relaxants - main muscle is the heart<br>  slow down the heart - slow down the blood (Oxygen!)|`|5yAsj29Vaa	As long as the Dr. that prescribed them to you knows you're pregnant, you should be fine.  You don't say what they are, so can't really tell you based on information given.|`|gEWt6eoCaa	You should ask your doctor.|`|FxAD44Moaa	sure will.. who prescribed them?  consult with them and your pediatrician.|`|445676ee4ba9ef6e5bd44f0f3b9d7501aa	Definitely ask your doctor.  Each medication is different...and while one might be safe, another might now be.<br>  <br>  I would say it can affect the baby...since the baby is developing his/her body and organs, high levels of your medication may cause developmental delays in your baby.<br>  <br>  But don't panic....talk to your doctor to be sure.  Don't take any medication or supplements unless you've spoken to your doctor.|`|zz4J1PcSaa	everything does. However sometimes the doctor has the weight the risk to you too. A few weeks back I was sick with the flu and bronchitis at the same time and had to take medicine. And my baby seems just fine now.|`|0UAIBW53aa	It might I took them when i was about 6 weeks and had a miscarriage. You should ask your doctor to make sure!
