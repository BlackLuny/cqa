If you had an 18 year old grandson who is very stubborn, and does pretty much what he wants to do with his life, but is very naive as to the way the world works, would you be happy (as his surrogate parent) in letting him move himself and his very few possessions way across the country? He knows no one there, except maybe someone he has met online. Would you let him go and wish him 'Godspeed'? Would you give him some money that you had saved up for him to go to college with ? Money he will never use to go to college since he does not want to go to college. He is highly intelligent, but very naive.

If, as Jefferson wrote, God endows us with the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, then these rights are permanently fixed.  We did not invent them, nor can anyone take them away (though they may not be honored by criminals or secured by government).      However, if we invent our rights, they may come and go under benevolent or malevolent governments, and we can invent wholly new rights (e.g., the right to abort prenates, euthanize the useless, or register sexually deviant relationships as marriage).      So from what source do our rights issue:  From the Creator or from the current decisions of people?

20090225124908AAayefK	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	People with knowledge of the mayan calender and alleged upcoming Apocalypse. Please help me.?	I watched a program on the Discovery Channel concerning an Apocalypse occurring in 2012. It's true that the end of the world has been predicted many times by various people. I know all of this. But the thought of the world ending in some way in the near future has began to consume me so that it has had a negative effect on my day to day life and performance in school. I usually dismiss things like this as rubbish but i haven't been able to shake it. I do not know much about the mayan ca lander or what it has predicted in the past and in the present. So what things has the Mayan calender predicted? Natural disasters? How many of them have occurred? And does it say specifically that the world will end in 2012 or is it just the last recorded date? Someone presented me with the information that the same people/person who predicted the fall of the Roman empire also predicted 2012 as the end of the world, as did the egyptians. Did they say this because the Mayan calender predicted it (if it actually did).      As you can see I've got alot of questions. I need some assurance that everything is going to be fine and that i've got nothing to worry over. I'm not religious so i don't want to be assured that it's not going to happen because it contradicts information provided by the bible.
20090225124852AA5YQRe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Catholics: Who is your Patron Saint?	Hey!! I'm Catholic and my Patron Saint is St. Jude!!

My mom and dad prayed the Saint Jude prayer, and on the 9th day they prayed  (since it's a novena) they got a call that said I didn't have it. This is amazing because they weren't suppost to get the news until like a week after the 9th day. So yeah. Mary (mother of God) might also be because I'm named after her.       Do you have a miracle from when you asked a saint to pray for you?? Let me know!! Also, tell me what you think of my story!       P.S. No mean answers!!!!!!!

Also, I had my teeth cut out before one of our 'big games' and he was making sure I was well enough to play the bb game.

[like smacking him in the butt. saying "wooooo [then his name] ...etc etc] then he'll look at me and his face gets really red...   Recently one of my friends was sitting next to me, she left and went to the bathroom..and he was sitting behind us, then he looks at me and says "I might steal her seat" like 5 minutes after she left, and he sat there..and One time I smiled at him and said hi [just being friendly, I do that to everyone] and he smiled really big and looked down..    I've been told he likes me..like by my friends and such..   but then i saw him last night and he talked to everyone else on our team..but then when he'd talk to me it's like he'd have his head down and then like look up at me... [and i'm not sure how he did that cuz he's like 8 or 9 inches taller than me] but he did somehow..   and he kept laughing..im not sure why, but after everything he'd say to me he'd look down and then he be like "ha..."   I'm not really sure if i like him in that way or not...   soo, what do ya'll think?....he's begining to confuse me..

20090225125346AA3HzsK	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Am I still a bad person for old Racism?	I used to make racist remarks and comments about people on say, the television.      I made them a lot. Before I met some of my friends/started playing Counter-Strike (in case you didn't know, everyone screams 'f**k you n****r' on the microphone 24/7) I wouldn't of even thought about saying something like this.      I said this sort of thing for a few months. Me and my friends found it funny (in case it's not clear, they said it too). After about 4 months I realised what I was saying was horrible. I felt terrible. I still do.      In my opinion, I'm still a bad person. But I've changed my ways and I'm no longer like this (I actually changed my life around - I don't swear, drink, make mean comments or say anything racist EVER).      Do you still think I'm a bad person? This guilt of what I used to say is tearing me apart... every time I hear someone mention the KKK or racists I instantly feel like crap.      Thanks.      EDIT: For the record, I never made fun of anyone I knew or acted on my thoughts.

20090225130235AAq5UBJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Comedians making anti-religion jokes?	Many stand-up comedians make jokes that are basically like serious arguments against religion, presented in a humorous way. For example, one of the most famous of such comedians would be George Carlin.  Whenever a comedian makes such jokes, the audience always laughs as if they understand the comedian's point and agree that the religion in question (usually Christianity in America) is flawed or untrue.  Yet, I'm sure most of those same audience members still end up going to church the following sunday and praying and reading the bible and believing in their religion.   So my real question that I'm getting at is: If people understand and agree with the points made in these jokes, why do they continue to believe in their religion? And if they don't agree with these anti-religious jokes, why do they laugh as though they do?      Considering that something like 90% of Americans are Christians, it's hard to believe that every audience member at a George Carlin or David Cross or Bill Maher performance is an atheist.

20090225130553AAbYFwe	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians:  What do you think of the star of Bethlehem from the Bible account of Jesus birth?	When I was a kid it always struck me as really unusual that a star could be hovering over a city / building.  Isn't that what the Bible says?      Then there were the 3 Magi who could read the stars and then found Jesus.  I guess that one ruler who asked them to help him, couldn't do it himself.  Doesn't Magi come from the word Magician, won't those guys Zoroastrians?  Doesn't this all sound like Astrology?      What implications does this whole star of Bethlehem story have on your faith in the Bible, God, Church or Jesus?  Doesn't it show that there is some seriously hokey stuff in that book?      I mean come on.  A star hovering over a specific place???  People reading the stars to find a virgin who is giving birth to a deity???  Doesn't that sound a little funny?

20090225130237AAkMNzS	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is being a Muslim/Arab really that bad?	I'm half Egyptian and am a Muslim. I'm a college freshman, just started in January. Before that, I was home schooled, and somewhat reclusive, only hanging out with other homeschoolers[some white, Hispanic, etc]. Until now, I have never had a problem with racism. Frankly, i thought Muslim people who complained about it were paranoid or exaggerating.   Before I state my problem, I want to make it clear, I am NOT oppressed or beaten or any stupid stereotype people believe about Muslim women. I do dress conservatively, and obviously live a conservative life. I love this country with all my heart, as I was born and raised here. If anyone ever thinks its okay to badmouth America to me, they are WRONG. I have a good education and can be very social.      Which leads me to my problem:      I went to school believing in the best of people. I live in a very ethnic city, where the minority's outnumber the 'majority'..I didn't believe anyone would be blatantly racist to me. I'm in my second month, and unfortunately, I was very wrong =[. It started out as cold stares, that long 'up-and-down' sweep of the eyes, and people getting quiet as I passed. Its progressed recently..a girl has called me a 'sandni**er' and someone has stolen an assignment I handed in and wrote on my jacket and shoved me[different class and building each experience, so it must be a different person]. I have made some friends, cuz I am pretty outgoing and kind, but I do, especially in some classes, feel that very cold attitude from people.      I would just like opinions, not advice. I don't intend to tell or take it any longer. I remained blissfully ignorant for awhile, but it breaks my heart that my belief in the best of people has been broken, that I am hated upon for my beliefs.

I don't think there's anything wrong with being a skeptic and only believing in what's been proven. But I wonder if you aren't just the tiniest bit hypocritical in your condemnations of other people's beliefs.      Do you believe people have souls?    Do you believe in God or in deities?   Do you believe in an afterlife?   Do you believe in prayer?      Do you believe in Acupuncture?    Do you think all those people in Asia are just reacting to a placebo effect?   Do you think animals can experience a placebo effect?      Western Medicine doesn't believe in chi/prana, souls, auras, ghosts, or any unproven energies. Yet doctors usually believe in God, souls and an afterlife. Medical insurance often pays for acupuncture, because it's been shown to be helpful for some people. Yet the principles behind it rely on a belief in chakras and energy meridians in the body.

20090128114256AAu3UE6	Society & Culture;Holidays;Valentine's Day	Valentines day mystery? How do I make this work?	My original plan went down the drain this morning.

Well, my Mom needs the 50 dollars so I told her she could have it since she paid for Bella(my dog) to go to the vet which was 60 dollars and bought her dog food plus 20 dollars means she spent 80 dollars on my dog. So here's my question I am still going to cook my boyfriend diner for Valentine's Day but what else can I do to make it more romantic other than it being just diner?

More studies are coming out to say that most asian women are really anorexic and I did see on youtube asians speaking out about the pressure to stay thin and being a size 4 is considered fat.       My main question is if more black women were thin (ya America as a whole of any race is becoming a bunch of fatties) meaning sizes 5 and under would white men be more open to date them?

20090225130809AADc41y	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What runes are used for a love spell?	I know a little bit about Witchcraft.  I was a practicing witch for many years, before laziness got the better of me.  But I never used runes.      A friend of mine is celebrating his birthday soon and he is upset because his ex-girlfriend destroyed his runestones when they broke up.  He has been feeling extremely lonely since she left and hasn't had much luck romantically.      So I was going to buy him some runestones so that he could cast a love spell.  The problem is that the store I go to has individual runes and not a set, and the store co-owner who actually used runes has quit.  The only owner left is a "Green witch" and doesn't like using runes or quartz's.      So, I figured I would ask the community that knows.  What runes should I get for him so that he could cast a spell to increase his luck with love?

20090225131914AA0E92E	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should I get together with aloof relatives this Easter?	Every Holiday my brother and I get together with relatives we do not like. Why? Because of history. We have been getting together with them for our entire life and it is expected.      Because my Aunt and her children (my cousins) know we are coming and take us for granted, they are cold, distant, aloof, and uncommunicative. No matter how hard we try the conversation is strained and we feel ill at ease. My cousins do not want to be there and they spend most of their time looking at their watches, arms crossed in a defensive way and say as little as possible. Getting my Aunt to say anything is like pulling teeth. You can cut the tension with a knife.      With this in mind should we:      Tell them we are busy this year (for the first time in 50 years)      Try to engage them in a discussion on why things are so tense? (It has never happened and all issues are unspoken)      Continue to attend this annual event and put in our time?

20090225131055AAr01b6	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: So guys, am I a weirdo or what?	I bet this question caught your attention! XD Okay, let me start off by saying I'm attracted to girls and boys, but more attracted to girls. Currently I'm in a relationship with a guy. I don't like to identify myself as bisexual so I just Am. You dig? I'm "label free"; you can interpret that however you'd like, but that's what I feel most comfortable identifying as.      Now onto the question -      When I'm with a girl I tend to act more dominant, sexually and mentally. Now that I'm with a guy I'm fine with letting him be dominant. If I had a girlfriend I'd take on a leader type role, and want control and want to protect her.       Am I some kind of weirdo? What's your opinion on this? Do I have multiple personalities, multiple needs, or just something else? Inquiring minds want to know.

Here are some details about my boyfriend:     *He is SO outrageously corny and loves when I am, example: He   loves it when we do things like write songs to each other and all those type of strange couple-y things.      * He is loves Anime, mostly drawing it. He is a fantastic artist. He can draw anting and make it look realistic.     * He loves the Band Inflames.     And, Basically, he is just the best ever and I feel so stupid, because I have basically NO money to even get him anything for Valentine's Day that's even close to describing how much I love him. We are pretty much the best couple and I don't want to mess this up.    Would it be an okay Idea to make him something?    Like a scrapbook type of thing full of memories and songs?    Remember this is only High school, But still I want to do something Unique that he will remember.   I feel kind of weird since he is a Senior and I'm only a Freshman.    I just don't want to mess this up. :)   Thanks.

20090128134109AAKY8bM	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Ramadan: is persecution worse than slaughter?	is it worse to persecute your enemies    rather than simply slaughter them?      if you only have one of two options:   which is the better one?   oppression   or death?      (let's assume YOU are   the one with the power   to decide what to do to   the enemies in question)      [Pickthal 2:191] And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers.      ***   next question:   if you are being persecuted   for your religious beliefs,   should you fight   or submit   or move?      let's say that you live in a country   ruled by sharia law   and you leave the religion of islam   and convert to hinduism...      [Pickthal 2:217] They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein.      abul ala mawdudi   (19th century pakistani   islamic scholar...highly regarded)   felt that these quranic verses    gave substantial weight to    the punishment of death   for apostasy:   [Pickthal 9:11] But if they repent and establish worship and pay the poor-due, then are they your brethren in religion. We detail Our revelations for a people who have knowledge.   [Pickthal 9:12] And if they break their pledges after their treaty (hath been made with you) and assail your religion, then fight the heads of disbelief - Lo! they have no binding oaths - in order that they may desist.

I usually never get any dates or special times with anyone anyway... all the wishes and dreams stay in my imagination... anyway, whether it be one holiday or the next, I just keep thinking about the "what if":  My special (and a little bit unusual) dream moment would be if a nice woman agreed to walk with me on Valentine's Day and hold my hand while we walked through town.  Once in a while, I might try to let go of her hand in a playful way and she'd keep holding on, lwhile we both laughed about it.

Just wanted to let everyone know that Afghanistan is full of our brothers and sisters who are homeless and have no food at all. The reason why that is is because Afghansitan has been at war for the last 30 years. It started in the 1970's when the Soviets invaded, then after the Mujehudeen defeated the Soviets, the Mujeudeen fought themselves for control of Afghanistan and then came the Taliban and I'm sure you all know how bad they were and now the West invaded Afghanistan and removed the Taliban from power and set up a new government wich made Afghanistan an Islamic Republic. But even now that the Taliban are fugitives, there are millions of Afghans left homeless and the current US backed government is too busy fighting the Taliban militias and other millitants to help the poor. Infact Afghanistan is the poorest country in Asia. Just look at this family who sold their childern to survive. click on the link to see it  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwTvqOH9o...

20090128135906AAX5VH9	Society & Culture;Languages	Can Someone Translate This Sentence Into Spanish!?	"I shall not argue against it from the supposed impossibility of infinite succession, barely and absolutely considered in itself; for a reason which shall be mentioned hereafter: but if we consider such an infinite progression, as one entire endless series of beings can have no cause from without, of its existence; because in it are supposed to be included all things that are or ever were in the universe: and ’tis plain it can have no reason within itself, of its existence; because no one being in this infinite succession is supposed to be self-existent or necessary (which is the only ground or reason of existence of any thing, that can be imagined within the thing itself, as with presently more fully appear), but every one dependent on the foregoing: and where no part is necessary; ’tis manifest the whole cannot be necessary; absolute necessity of existence, not being an outward, relative, and accidental determination; but an inward and essential property of the nature of the thing which so exists."      --It's from a book!

20090128140824AADbMI0	Society & Culture;Etiquette	I'm Snowed In With A Jerk- HELP?	Long story short, a friend of mine was kicked out of his house. Unfortunately, he decided to come over to MY house on the same day of the biggest snow storm of the year, and has been here for two days.    Right now, we're under a Level 2 Snow Emergency, and you're advised not to drive. Well, he takes that as meaning he CAN'T drive. He's staying here until Midnight (or later) and I'm getting fed up with him.    He's taking up my whole couch, playing my wii, talking crap, and trying to tell me that my pets aren't properly cared for (trained, bathed, blah blah blah). I'm ready to throw him out on the street, but I'm here by myself (husband is at work) and I'm not in the mood for a confrontation.    How can I get through the next eight hours without committing a homicide?
20090128141534AAtoUhC	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do non black people get mad when we black ppl use the n-word to address each other?	it's merely a sign of solidarity and brotherhood. Of course, when another ethnic group says it, it's racist because they are not black whereas when a black says it, it obviously cannot be racist; so therefore we can say it.       is that so hard to understand? Why all the whining and complaining? People don't complain that only gays can use the word "fag" but complain when only black people can use the word n*gga.

Don't get me wrong I thought it turned out to be a beautiful movie.  Sigourney Weaver was amazing and it brought me to tears many times but...    I found the beginning really forced.  The acting was painful (at that point), and there didn't feel like there was any real emotion between the characters.    Particularly I'm disappointed it didn't focus on Bobby's coming to accept himself more...nor did it focus on his relationship with David.  More of their deepening relationship I think would have helped make it that much more tragic.      Any thoughts?

Also do not get confused you can control your emotions there's a difference. you can choose not to have sex with the same sex that would be controlling your emotion of homosexuality.      And if you are going to say something like "you are wrong" or "gayness is a choice" or something along the lines of that with out giving some reason why it is a choice, then I would rather that you just put just a period or something and get your two points because you would just be wasting my time.

20090128140948AAw3JEu	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	How can i stop being so jealous before it destroys my relationship?	My girlfriend and i have been together for nearly 2 years now, and i have always been quite jealous and possessive which i know is wrong, but i can't seem to help it. Now it is getting worse and she is understandably getting fed up with it. I want to stop it before i end up driving her away, but i need some help.   Basically, i'm a completely insecure mess, i don't feel that i'm good enough for her and i feel so lucky to be with her. I am quite happy when we are out with mutual friends but whenever she mentions speaking to or seeing someone that i don't know, my insecurities start to boil over and i think to myself 'what if she fancies them?'   It doesn't even have to be other girls though, even though we're in a gay relationship, i'm still jealous of her male friends. She is a firefighter and works with 16 guys who are always making innuendos and sending her dirty jokey texts which she says are harmless, but i hate it.   She is not as open about her sexuality as i am, and although her colleagues know about me, i have never met most of them and am never invited to work gatherings where all the other wifes and girlfriends are present. I on the other hand, i speak about her all the time at work and have taken her out to meet my colleagues.   I feel like she's embarrassed of me and our relationship.   Recently, she's taken up a part time job working in a school, and has become friendly with a group of girls there, and she has told me that she thinks one of them is gay. She has begun texting this girl, who is kind of flirting with my girlfriend, but in an innocent way. The thing is, this is how we got together originally, with me sending her innocently flirty messages.    She has told me that i'm driving her mad with my jealousy, and i can understand this, i'm just so scared that she's going to leave me for someone better. What can i do to stop me being such a paranoid mess?

For some reason I don't not feel content with this person I am looking into, the problem is I had my hope placed on someone else but certain situations arised hence we could not get married. It seems my mind is still 'stuck' on him, not that I love him or anything but which ever guy I get to know, the other guy whom I wanted to marry always creeps up, hence I am not able to move on...      What shall I do?   I have read the Guidance prayer but still my mind is confused.

20090128134810AA4ffJm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the real definition of repent?	Does repent mean to never sin again after you have been reborn? I don't know how that's possible because i've been reborn and I still sin. The bible also says we have all fallen short of god and we all have sinned. Does it mean to just feel bad about your sin and to try as hard as you can to stop them from happening again? That's what I'm leaning towards and by know means am i saying well i know i will be forgiven so i can do what i want. I know that's not what we should do if you love Jesus. I love him dearly but i still mess up sometimes. Not usually big mistakes but sometimes things happen where i just wasn't thinking right or lost control over my self. Its just a very confusing to me because i know Jesus said to sinners if you believe in me i will heal you the price has been paid and he also said to them to Sin no more. But i really believe its impossible to completely never sin even after you give your self to him. What does Jesus expect from me. I would appreciate any answers from people who know a lot about the true definition of repent.

20090128141312AANM2iP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is your belief about the Afterlife?	Here is what I believe:       I believed that the dead are transported to the Otherworld by the God  Belenus. Life continues in this location much as it had before death. After the person dies in the Otherworld, their soul reincarnates and lives again in another living entity -- either in a plant or the body of a human or other animal. After a person has learned enough at this level, they move on after death to a higher realm, which has its own Otherworld. This continues until the individual reaches the highest realm, the "Source." "All things are created from the Source, including the Gods. We are just sparks from its flame."       What is your belief on the afterlife?

20081030210514AA1XAcJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How can I be a Christian and not be seen as a hater?	Just the fact that i'm Christian I feel I bring hostility or a threat.  See as loving as I try to be.  The problem rises when i'm Christian but the bible says homosexuality isn't right.  If I have friends who have family who are gay.  What am I saying?  Why do I feel weak to show my Christian side when people I know may be offended that I'm Christian, because I don't believe homosexuality is right.        There is this prop 8 that I feel i should support, but then that would make me hateful or prejudice.  How do I vote?? God is the center of my life.  How can I not be seen as a hater?  i know i can't please everyone but without saying it.  I feel like i'm threatening them.  Like you're going to hell because you aren't Christian or I don't agree with gays so I hate them.  That isn't me to decided, but I sometimes feel like a terrible vibe.  Do you get me? What I believe in is a threat to others just for believing in Christ.  I feel like i'm offending people who have families that aren't Christian.  Even my family aren't Christian and I feel like they are thinking they are going to hell.  It's tough when i'm the only Christian in my immidiate family.  It's hard to talk about Christ without disrespecting or offending them.        Is it normal to feel like i'm hated.  I know i won't please everyone but what can i do?  i just speak to myself but that isn't right.  i shouldn't be ashamed to be Christian and i'm not.

20081103020015AATOtYH	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	? amigos  creyentes conocen el mensaje  donde San Agustín, habla del amor y la riqueza?	San Agustín (354-430) obispo de Hipona (áfrica del Norte) y doctor de la Iglesia   Exposición sobre el salmo 121      ?Te pagarán cuando resuciten los justos?          El amor tiene un gran poder; es nuestra fuerza. Si carecemos de amor, todo el resto no nos servirá de nada. ?Yo podría hablar las lenguas de los hombres y de los ángeles, dice el apóstol Pablo, si no tengo amor, no soy más que un metal que resuena o unos platillos que aturden? (1C 13, 1). Escuchad seguidamente esta magnífica palabra: ?Podría repartir en limosna todo lo que tengo, y aun dejarme quemar vivo; si no tengo amor, de nada me sirve? (v. 3). Si sólo tienes amor, aunque no puedas dar nada a los pobres, amas. Aunque no dieras más que ?un vaso de agua fresca? (Mt 10,42) eso solo ya sería suficiente para obtener la misma recompensa que Zaqueo, que distribuyó la mitad de su fortuna (Lc 19,8) ?Cómo puede ser esto? ?Uno da poco, el otro mucho y sus gestos tienen el mismo precio? Pues sí –los recursos son desiguales pero el amor es el mismo...          El salmista dice: ?Vamos a la casa del Se?or? (Sl 121,4). Es a nosotros que nos toca ver si realmente vamos. No son nuestros pies, sino nuestros corazones los que nos conducen hasta allí. Ved si vamos hacia allá; que cada uno se pregunte: ?Qué haces para el fiel pobre, para tu hermano indigente o para el mendigo que tiende su mano? Fíjate en si tu corazón es estrecho... ?Buscad lo que construye la paz de Jerusalén? (v. 6). ?Qué es lo que hace que haya paz en Jerusalén? ?La abundancia para los que te aman? (Vulg). El salmista se dirige a Jerusalén: ?Los que te aman vivirán en la abundancia? –la abundancia después del despojo. Aquí abajo, la miseria, allá arriba, la abundancia; aquí, la debilidad, allá, la fuerza; los que son pobres aquí, allá arriba serán ricos. ?De donde les viene su riqueza? De haber dado aquí los bienes, recibidos de Dios, que poseían por un tiempo; allá reciben lo que Dios les da por toda la eternidad.          Hermanos míos: aquí los ricos son los pobres; es bueno que el rico descubra su pobreza. ?Se cree que está lleno? Es hinchamiento, no plenitud. Que reconozca su vaciedad para poder ser colmado. ?Qué es lo que posee? Oro. ?Qué es lo que todavía le falta? La vida eterna. Que mire bien lo que tiene y reconozca lo que le falta. Hermanos, que dé lo que posee a fin de recibir lo que no tiene.         que tengan todos un hermoso día!

20070429094244AA0Du4G	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What makes you think this is a christian nation?	The United States Bill of Rights consists of the first 10 amendments to the United States Constitution. These amendments limit the powers of the federal government, protecting the rights of all citizens, residents and visitors on United States territory. Among the enumerated rights these amendments guarantee are: THE FREEDOMS OF SPEECH, press, AND RELITION; the people's right to keep and bear arms; the freedom of assembly; the freedom to petition; and the rights to be free of unreasonable search and seizure; cruel and unusual punishment; and compelled self-incrimination. The Bill of Rights also restricts Congress' power by PROHIBITING IT FROM MAKING ANY LAW RESPECTING ESTABLISHMENT OF RELIGION and by prohibiting the federal government from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.      Knowing your history goes a long way to proving your claims.  So are you sure we're a christian nation, or are you just claiming it in the name of your religion?

Elle a vécu 7 ans avec un homme, séparée depuis 1 an on va dire, cela fait 8 mois qu'elle et moi sommes ensemble. C'est le pied total à tous les niveaux. Cependant, la, on vient d'entamer une pose car je me pose trop de questiions...est elle bien avec moi qui suit une fille? Elle me dit qu'elle ne veut pas de mec, qu'elle en ressent pas le besoin mais que tout de meme la pénétration lui manque. Alors elle réfléchi en ce moment. Elle m'aime car elle me le dit souvent, et ca se voit vu toutes les petites attentions qu elle m'apporte tous les jours. (regards, coups de tel...) on c quitté lotre fois, on a recouché ensemble une fois après...l'attraction était trop forte. Mais la j'ai mis le frein car j'ai vraiment besoin  de confiance et de sécurité dans notre couple. Alors à part les homophobes à 2 balles, les autres vous en pensez quoi?? Merci à vous et bonne soirée =)

20070719162527AAClTrC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If you believe Einstien was a great scientist then why cant you believe the things he said about GOD?	1. The harmony of natural law reveals an intelligence of such superiority that, compared with it, all the systematic thinking and acting of human beings is an utterly insignificant reflection.      2.The religious inclination lies in the dim consciousness that dwells in humans that all nature, including the Humans in it is in no way an accidental game, but a work of lawfulness that there is a fundamental cause of all existence.      3.Try and penetrate with our limited means the secrets of nature and you will find that, behind all the discernable laws and connections, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force that is beyond anything that we can comprehend  is my religion. To that extent I am, in fact,  religious.      4.No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.

Every step that he takes hurts and I work in an office environment and live with my parents. When we hang out, I always pay for him because I know he works harder for his money and lives without the support of his parents. He's always asking me to buy him things and I buy it for him. Last time we met a girl at the bus stop, she worked part time, minimum wage and had to go 3 days without food because she couldn't afford to eat. She told us she gave her child up for adoption. My friend Joshua, then gives her a dirty look and asks her why she did that half an hour after meeting her. When she said she didn't have money, he gave me an accusing dirtly look and says "you said there is no poverty in canada." (and tried to humiliate me in front of her, and entice her against me) I think he's an arrogant jerk for judging me... as if he is God himself, perfect and without flaws. I loathe him for doing that... Am I right?

20090225075423AAhu2jk	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If thoughts of suicide came into my mind, is this just God wanting my soul to rejoin It more quickly?	I mean for anyone contemplating suicide, could this be interpreted as a whisper from God saying, "Pssst!  Hey, I'd like you to come 'home' now!  Even though my various publications hint that it's an unsavory end, forget about that, I really want you to fast track your way back!"

I had 2 bad experiences, one I bought a CD and the seller ran off with about 30 people's money without sending anyone their CD.   Another person bid the highest for 2 concert tickets which I couldn't make, but then just never sent me any money and clearly didn't want them. When I complained about the person they threatened to send the boys round if I say anything else. It was too late to sell the tickets after that so I lost all my money on them.      Both times ebay didn't want to know. Can't stand the site!

20090225075841AAhgqW0	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Am I still a bad person for past racism?	Hi. I used to tell racist jokes or make racist remarks a lot when I became friends with a certain person. He made them a lot, and I got 'dragged in'. A lot of the sites I hung out on/games I played were full of people being racist too. I sort of... adopted this.      Like I said, I made them a lot. But, since then, I've realized my wrongs and now I never dare say anything like that. I feel terrible about what I did. I'm a sinner repenting my sins.      I feel disgusted with myself for what I did. Do you think I'm still a bad person?      For the record, I no longer hang out with the racists...      Thanks.

20090102214816AAQf7z0	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Você sabia que o nome de Satanás n?o é Lúcifer?	Alguns talvez fa?am referência a Isaías 14:12-16. Segundo a vers?o da Sociedade Bíblica Trinitária (e a Figueiredo), o versículo doze diz: “Como caíste do céu, ó Lúcifer, filho da alva! Como foste cortado por terra, tu que desbaratavas as na??es!” A palavra “Lúcifer” é tradu??o da palavra hebraica hehlel, “brilhante”. Heklel, conforme usada aqui, n?o é nome pessoal, nem título, mas, antes, termo descritivo da posi??o brilhante ocupada pela dinastia de reis de Babil?nia, na linhagem de Nabucodonosor. N?o seria correto dizer-se que Satanás, o Diabo, é o chamado Lúcifer, como se este fosse um de seus nomes. A express?o refere-se aqui principalmente ao rei de Babil?nia, pois, segundo o versículo quatro, trata-se duma “express?o proverbial contra o rei de Babil?nia”. Além disso, acontece que os que vêem este “brilhante” reduzido a esta condi??o dizem: “é este o homem que agitava a terra, que fazia tremer os reinos?” Satanás n?o é homem, mas criatura espiritual invisível. Assim, embora o rei de Babil?nia refletisse a atitude de seu pai, o Diabo, ainda assim, a palavra Lúcifer n?o era nome dado a Satanás, o Diabo.    Interessante né?
