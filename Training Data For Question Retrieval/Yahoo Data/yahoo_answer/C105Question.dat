Now my ex has backed out of our daughter coming next summer and sent me a text that says the only option I have is to come stay at his house so that I can see her and that he made plans already for the summer. He says that California only gives the parent 4 weeks every other year ands I say it is sis weeks every year for summer and every other holiday.       Our order states that if we can not agree it falls back to the states outline for visitation. I always thought the outline was six eeks every summer for out of state parents. I know 4 weeks every other summer is just stupid and I do not know anyone that gets only that.

I understood, and I didnt hate her for it. I figure that shes questioning, or going through something. But either way, I accept her.   Well, we are Mormon. We go almost every Sunday, and she goes on Wednesdays also. One of the girls found my daughter on Myspace.com, and saw that it said "bisexual." Those girls told their mothers, and today one woman scolded me and said, "We dont want your sick child around our daughters. She isnt welcome here!" So I simply left. But then I started to get harassing phone calls. They had decided among themselves that my daughter shouldnt go. Well, my daughter has gone every year, and now shes very depressed. What should I do? She still has many school friends, but shes heartbroken over church, and what has happened.

I've read a lot on a website called SFTT.org about some armor called 'Dragon Skin' and how it is superior to the armor being bought for our soldiers today. It is more supple and has many overlapping plates in it, instead of a big plate. There is some interesting video on the website of it taking some pretty impressive hits, and outperforming the stuff our soldiers are wearing today. Yet the US military still insists on buying from the company with the giant recall, and Dragon Skin is fobidden. If in fact Dragon Skin is superior, and the stuff our soldiers are wearing is only being issued because of back door gladhanding among the politicians and the military industrial complex, then that is a crime. Our soldiers should be wearing the best armor available, not the stuff made by whoever greases the palms of enough higher ups to win the contract.

It utterly failed because people saved the money or used it to pay off an existing bill instead of spending it (which is what is needed to "stimulate" the economy)      If you received a check instead of the government spending on your behalf, would you spend it?

20090128213928AAMGi8s	Politics & Government;Politics	America, why did we let the Stimulus Package get approved?	Let's think about this for a second...    Did we not approve of a 700 Billion Bail out and only come to find that it wasn't working? And we are approving of another 800 Billion..with 2/3 going to Government spending.    this money (not the tax relief portion) will take about 18 months to create some jobs. And if it does create some jobs...how does it sustain itself? The answer is Tax Payers will continue to pay for it. If you think that this 800 Billion will be the last..you are wrong. Bigger the government...the more taxes needed to keep it going.    You see? Unlike the private sector...Government is not in the Business of making money. It only spends it. It get's it's revenue from Tax Payers. The Private Sector sustains itself through the market by making profit. It doesn't require directly tax dollars to sustain itself. There is a circulation of money, driven by demand, between consumer and corporations in the private sector and that relationship bubble adjust in size based on the market. It adjust by itself naturally....but the relationship between Government and people is different. Government doesn't adjust in size based on the economy. It stays or it grows. Rarely does it downsize.     This has been tried over and over before and it hasn't worked. I cannot believe of what I just witnessed. Bush tried it. It didn't work.

Officially this discharge occurred because of separation anxiety.  However it was because of a failed family care plan for my son.  I was married as you can't go into the USAF as a single parent, my husband depped into the USN both of us active duty.  He went SWCC requiring training before shipping that hadn't been discussed with us prior to his job selection.  So I shipped for USAF, he was mandated to training, and the assigned guardian backed out.  Obviously I don't want to say this in my appeal or review packet.  I'm just looking for anybody that might have any ideas as to what would be the best route to take in this situation.  I was in BMT when this all happened and have never had any psychiatric condition in my life.  It was classified as low-level separation anxiety from my son.  I haven't had any health problems, and I can't think of anything else excluding me from serving.  However I should mention I now have two children, and no I won't be making the same mistake twice of shipping until I'm sure my children will have adequate, reliable care.  I want to serve my country I just want to make sure my kids will be taken care of too.

All they asked for was Proof that Osama Committed 9/11 and then they would hand him over, instead of giving them Proof we invaded.....   So why did we not just give proof that Osama did 9/11, Instead of killing 100's of thousands of Civilians and Soldiers. WIth Osama still not captured.      I don't get the logic behind it, if we had proof why didn't we give it to them, so they would peacefully hand him over...      The Videotape Confession of Osama is not proof, on the basic level even a retard could tell that it wasn't Osama in that tape..... It's an obvious fake, proven to be a fake at that.. The only one says it was real it is the Government.... NO one else... Not even the Universities that have tested them. Not even Osama says it's real.      Besides that Osama said he didn't do 9/11 a few days after it, then all of a sudden we just happen to find the confession video in a random house in Pakistan after Bin Laden says he didn't do it... There's to many inconsistencies with that...

20090128215543AAZaWyN	Politics & Government;Government	How would you vote or feel if what is listed below was a small piece of the budget?	Here is part of the plan thought of, but the government does not want to listen to history or to someone who has experiences in dealing with problems.    A) Scrape the present taxation system completely, and create a flat tax of 17.5% across the board regardless of income. This would create an increase of take home money to the people of about 55.5%  B) Ask all Canadians to accept a wage and salary freeze for a period of 3 years @ 2008 levels. (Except for politicians who truly care for this country and its people. see next point)  C) Politician should be willing to be leaders in tackling this problem since they are part of the solution/issue.  - Therefore they should take a pay cut of 34%. This would release Millions of dollars to be re-allocated.  - Also, thier pension plans should fall in line with the guidline of the average Canadian based on the Maxium allowable under the Canada Pension Plan.  - The removal of the 8 year clause for quailifing for full pension.  D) implement a reward or penality system in regards to business/corporations as follows:  Reward - no taxes to be applied up to an amount of $1 Billion of Gross profits if 25% of that amount is re-invested in Canada only (not oversea ventures). This would help create jobs, build infrastrues, broaden employment, educate workers, and help stimulate the economy of the future. (ie: expansions, r&d, new products, new program.) This also allows companies the pride of giving back to this country.  Penality - 32% tax for any amount of money sent out of this country. This helps Canada because it is compensation for lost of present and future revenue. (ie: jobs lost or not created)  To help equal out the playing field pass legislation to cap the gross mark-up/profit margins of selling goods 35.3%. This would create a competitive field for better quality and workmanship. Because the present taxation system would be scraped there would not be a manufacturing tax, HST, GST or PST.  In regards to Provincial/Federal Crown Corporations they must follow the guidline just like everyone else.    For students who recieve loans allow them the same amount of time to pay back the loan as it took them to get into debt interest free  ie: if they borrowed for 5 year then allow them 5 years to pay it all back. Any outstanding balance after their interest free period, would then become due or interest will be added to that balance at prime + 1.5%     This is just a part of what can be done when listening to the Canadian People.

The name is an allusion to Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus for 30 pieces of silver. (From Merriam Webster’s Dictionary)      Barack Hussein Obama is a Judas Goat.      Extremist Jews guided Barack Hussein Obama’s career from day one, even all the way back to Harvard Law School.  Radical Zionist hitman, David Axelrod previously orchestrated the Jewish-financed and organized defeat of perceived anti-Zionist Sen. Charles Percy. He is the man who ran Obama’s campaign for President and who is his chief handler. Obama’s campaign was overwhelmingly financed by the most powerful Zionist bankers in the world. His campaign’s largest contribution source was the Zionist international banking firm of Goldman Sachs. (FEC campaign records). In both Obama’s Senate and Presidential campaign he prostrated himself before AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee) promising even more money and blood for Israel’s terrorism than even the supine John McCain, and even more money and blood than the previous Shabbez Goy in the White House, George Bush. Before the Israeli terrorism and mass murder in Gaza, he went to Israel and said that he supported Israel’s planned murderous terrorism against the men, women and children of Gaza.

Mayor Blomberg states on Feb 19th that 5% of New Yorkers 40,000 pay 50% of all the taxes out of a city of 8 million says if he taxes them anymore many might leave sending the city into default.       Now we have a president that basically espousing this type of thinking if the Mayor recognize it won't work for NY why will it work for the US. Liberals is squeezing the people that create the jobs and pay the most taxes the solution if it is please explain as logically as you possibly can aren't these the same type of people that will needed to fund our government spending

A professor (a married man-44 years old) has touched a student (a 28 year old single woman) inappropriately and has kept asking her for sex, which she has said no).       She has brought it to judicial affairs and they are investigating it. First, she testified in front of the Director and then the professor needs to come in to meet with the Director, however he asked for more time to prepare which was granted to him.       Then the Director told the student that the professor won't be meeting with the Director in the immediate future and will let her know about the finding of the investigation. Does that mean that the Director will not meet with the professor or that the Director will meet with the professor in some point in time?

On a second occasion I had an ugly argument w my girlfriend. Our arguments would regularly get physical and onthis occasion I hit her on the top of her head with an open hand. She closed her mouth abruptly and chipped a corner of her tooth. She called the cops but changed her mind once they got there cuz she knew it had been an accident. However, I was still taken in for identification. In Wales, its normal procedure. There was no charges and no investigation. We both agreed it was an accident, although i did hit her, the resulting damage wasnt intended.   I was interviewed by the police and it was recorded. Photograph and dna samples were taken. Nasty stuff, but in the end i wasnt charged. Just a statemnet was taken from me (none from my gf)   would i have been cautioned on any of thiese cases?

(except for people on welfare)  So logically shouldn't it all cost the same amount of money.   Flat tax isn't where you pay the exact same amount of money but you would still pay the same percentage as everybody else in america.            Now i fully understand that some people can't afford to pay that amount of money.  but without a flat tax system wouldn't you say that it is taking away from our ability to truly achieve the american dream.  Because if you have to keep paying more and more taxes the richer you get.  It will become harder and harder to earn more money.     It's just like if you went to mcdonalds and they said that they were going to charge the rich people 20 dollars for a hamburger so that the poor can get it for free.

Like the public is supposed to be fooled into believing that we have a choice, when we really don't seeem to, IMO.      But if all the so called "Independant" Parties, who some of them do seem to really have varying values were also on the ballots, giving each Party the same chance to get voted for in a major election, then there would be a lot more room for positive change, and possibly less corruption.      Is there someone or some group somewhere in the Shadows that pulls strings to ensure that only the two we see ever get on the ballot?

We lost out dogs about 4 months ago, one was a very expensive mini pincher, the other a jack Russel terrier. I spent all my free time for over a month looking for them.       Tonight we found them, in our neighborhood. My family was taking a walk and heard them barking, and upon further investigation we found them in a side yard.       We got them back, they were in good shape, and I am very happy to have them back.       What those people did was wrong, they could have easily found us and returned our dogs. We had fliers less than 100 feet from their house, and over 50 fliers in the neighborhood. The dogs had tags on and chips in them.       I know that people are supposed to take lost dogs to pounds where they are kept for two weeks and if no one claims them the rescuers can be first on the list to get the dogs.      What kind of legal action can I take against these people.   I think it is important for everyone to understand that we love our dogs like family. We were heartbroken!

On one of the inside pages was an article about the alleged comedienne Joan Rivers applying for a pistol purchase permit, citing death threats as a reason for the request.  This brought to mind the following questions:      1. Why should she have had to seek permission to arm herself?    2. Why did this become public knowledge?   3. Who thought that she was sufficiently important to kill?   Anyway, in late July 1990, a wire service article appeared in my local newspaper that Ms. Rivers had received her purchase permit.  so my next questions are:   4. If it took NINE MONTHS for even a celebrity to get a response on a permit request, how long does it take the average citizen?   5.  Is NYC REALLY safer because people have to wait so damn long?      People of New York, it's time you stood up and demanded that your city and state honor your God-given, constitutionally-guaranteed right to keep and bear arms, and ABOLISH all your restrictions on gun ownership!

20090129000406AA8Ma1B	Politics & Government;Government	The economic stimulus explained to a five year old?	Here's a basic outline of how I view the stimulus -- if your ideas vary, write comments below.  I'm trying to wrap my head around spending 1.3 trillion dollars when we're up against 14 trillion dollar GDP.      Assume you have a bucket full of water that represents the amount of economic activity in the market - (it's 14 trilion dollars)      As long as their are no holes in the bucket -- it remains at 14 trillion dollars...where businesses operate efficiently pulling profits and employing people.      Now assume we take a screwdriver and jam a hole in the bottom of the bucket and say that represents the housing crisis -- the escaping water is actually people losing money -- the credit markets freezing up (no loans/no credit cards/reduced credit lines/etc) - home equity lines of credit freezing up - spending stops -- businesses suffer -- people laid off -- more spending stops -- more businesses suffer -- more people laid off...it's a vicious cycle that won't stop for a while.      So now you have a bucket filled with water representing 14 trillion dollars worth of economic activity -- but as the clock ticks it drops to 13.9 trillion...13.6 trillion....13.2 trillion...okay?      The water is going to leak until consumer spending (demand) matches the products/service supplied (supply). Basic economics tells us when demand goes down -- and supply stays the same...the price must drop to a new equilibrium where output and supply must also recede (businesses scale back). The same thing applies here.      So -- we need to find some way to increase demand.      What the stimulus proposes is that we inject more money into the market to offset the amount of economic activity escaping.      Let the water hose represent the stimulus. If we turn the water on and pour it into the bucket (inject money via infrastructure investments) -- we can theoretically slow the rate at which the economic activity is decreasing. You'll have water leaking out of the bottom (loss of activity) and water being poured into the top (increased activity).      Essentially what it does is creates an artificial bottom or an equilibrium at a higher point than would be demanded by conventional usage of the law of supply, the law of demand and the point at which they cross, the equilibrium.      However -- if for some reason the hose stops pumping water (we run out of money in the stimulus w/in 4 years) before the leak on the bottom of the bucket is fixed (the economy hasn't experienced any growth and consumers haven't replaced the government spending with their own), then the free-market will take over and "drain" economic activity until we reach the true supply and demand equilibrium....say economic activity at 7 trillion instead of 14 trillion.      What the stimulus proposed to do is create a support somewhere between 7 and 14 trillion until consumers are willing and capable of spending again to support business and subsequent economic growth/strength.      The question is:   1. Is the stimulus big enough? (Can we keep the hose running long enough to plug the leak in the bottom of the bucket?)   2. If the hose does dry up, what do we do? Does the government ask for "stimulus II" and do taxpayers approve it? Or do we say "nope, didn't work -- let the free-market take over and we'll take our chances that we'll only be in the trough for a short period of time before we experience growth/expansion.      Remember the natural business cycles are:      Expansion - Peak - Contraction - Trough - Expansion - Peak - Cont....      We're in a contraction period sliding into a trough -- and the unknowns are how deep will we go (can it drop to 5 trillion...3 trillion...probably not)? And how long will wel be here (2 years, 5 years, 10 years)?      This is the problem I see. The stimulus only uses 300 billion dollars of direct investment in infrastructure. The annual economic activity is 14 TRILLION dollars. And the 300 billion is spread over 4 years. I don't think it'll make a noticeable impact. The trickle from the hose will be no match for the hole in the bottom of the bucket and I believe we'll see no slowing in the loss rate of economic activity. That is to say the trickle from the top (government spending) will be no match for the gaping hole at the bottom (free-market correction).      I think it's the foot in the door and the Administration will be back asking for more money soon. It's already rumored that the banks are going to get another "bailout" to the tune of 2.2 trillion dollars.      When will it stop? It's lunacy.      The government likes to talk about "kick starts" and instigating growth through these types of programs but it couldn't be further from the truth...the injection of money isn't big enough.      It doesn't matter how much money we inject, we're subject to the workings of the natural business cycle in the free-market. In other words, until we plug the hole in the bottom of the bucket, there's nothing we can do to maintain our 14 trillion dollar peak (absent of spending tr

20090129024741AArVABr	Politics & Government;Politics	Should our leaders be concerned about a possible health care system crash? ?	I've said it for a long time. There's no way this industry can always continue to thrive when industries in entire communities are going bankrupt and laying people off. People turned to it in Michigan when their auto jobs laid them off. You hear it from people around town that the hospital and nursing care places are the best industry to find a job in the area.      Then I see the people that go to the hospital that work retail, minimum-wage. The bills bankrupt them. But that's the vast majority of people that live in the area and what they do. The hospitals build palaces, the doctors build palaces, the hospitals hire anyone that takes a few classes, the drug reps buy them endless amounts of food...it's gravy for them at everyone else's expense.      I'm really worried what will happen when a.) health care is nationalized, b.) the government clamps down on the costs of health care and drugs or c.) hospitals and whatnot realize the money just isn't there for all these ludicrous costs.      I fear people will envy Soviet hospitals when reality comes to American health care. These people have been partying way too long at the expense of others. They're almost as bad as the Wall Street guys.      It's going to happen. People want to think they're safe in the health care field, but they'd better believe their jobs are just as vulnerable as anyone else's.

Add that to the stimulus plan, pass a trillion dollar plan, give each person 18+ 4500 dollars.      4500 to spend on anything. maybe even give it in a certain type of authorized "credit" form, so people can't buy illegal things, but can buy anything and everything else from tv's to paying off bills. This will drive people to use more money. For example, someone might use the $4500 to buy a $6000 dollar car they've always wanted. The buyer uses 2000 dollars more. even better! Consumer activity will shoot up and stocks will go up.      find any holes in this plan??

A feudal system is one with an upper class heirarchy where everyone under it pays tarrifs/fees to the monopoly of those at the top rung.      When the U.S. was first created it was illegal for governement to tax property/land... taxing such stuff is nothing more than saying that you do not own it but rather the feudal lord does and if they do not recieve their due you will be thrown off your lands and starved.      With all the mutual, bank, and money funds (and insurance companies) owning a piece of and controlling everything, a case can be made that they and the central bank have nothing at all to do with free markets (capitalism) but are in their entirety a monopoly (when one fails, they are bailed out by either their associates or by the government... all at the expense of the populace who owns nothing as everything the public has shall be taken from them if they don't continue to pay dues)

If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around [the banks] will deprive the people of all property until their children wake-up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered. The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs. Did you know Thomas Jefferson said this? Did you know the Federal Reserve is a private bank?

20090129024640AAMaDg7	Politics & Government;Government	Is Obama's Stimulus the biggest pork package ever?  SQueeeeeeeeeeeeeeel!?	I have read that it includes money for safe sex education (one of MANY examples)!  How will this help the economy!  It's pork like this that pisses me off.  Obvioulsy there is nothing wrong with this concept, but why should we go into debt to fund this.  All of this money is not coming from taxes,  it will be added to out national debt (which we also pay interest on)!      I would compare the stupidity of the pork in this bill to the logic behind taxpayers funding the "Don't call things gay" Ad Council commercials.  Seriously, people have to pay for this crap and I (& future generations) would prefer to have this money in their savings so we can retire before age 80!

If they have had no prior criminal records or anything. just this case.

20090128235043AA5jQ7N	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Not paying taxes - a form of civil disobedience?	We are fighting two very expensive wars. We have a social security system that cannot be sustained. The words "pork-barrel spending" have never been so popular, yet the government just passed an $800 billion dollar "stimulus" plan. And our new president (aka the second coming of Christ *rolls eyes*) wants to tackle universal healthcare. Our hard-earned money is being funneled away, and to what? I doubt if any of us will see one iota of improvement due to an "economic plan" made of money conjured from thin air. More likely that our taxes will be raised, our services snipped, trimmed and then cut altogether, and our quality of life will be flushed down the toilet.       California is unlikely to issue anything more than an IOU as a tax refund. My state alone is $65 billion in debt and struggling to remain afloat as our economy drags every man under.       What could make them listen? A revolution sure, but most of our able-bodied men can't pull themselves away from Halo long enough to organize a coup. Hell, most of them probably don't know what a coup is. But money. Money they would listen to.       What if everyone stopped paying their taxes? I think this is a legitimate idea.

I'm bad at timed-test taking, and I don't think any four-year universities would be impressed with my ACT score   5. In my state, there is a law that guarantees anyone with an associates degree admission into a public university.   6. I can't drive.

Are they sure that Usamah(real name) is still alive, powerful enough & able to control from caves ? About Saddam Husain too they wrote as " He only is controlling & causing turmoil . The moment he is caught, everything will be contained." But that never happened rather, reverse happened. Usamah was having renal failure even before 2001. Is it possible for him to survive so long in caves in spite of that or USA is playing games by putting its puppets as dummy Usamahs to justify everything wrong to be done in the areas of its interest indefinitely ?   It seems that the propaganda of Usamah alive is much more useful for USA & its Jewish lobby than dead Usamah. Is that real reason of western media keeping Usamah alive in news ? Aren't all so called Usamah's videos coming regularly from USA sources animated ones like dinosaur films looking like real ones ? Is not western media controlled by Jewish lobby worst ever treacherous & misusing the name of Usamah according to the preplanned dirtiest politics ?

I mean, you don't hear about Eisenhower running similar campaigns or tactics against his opponents.. do you think Nixon is the one who started this whole divisiveness not over the issues but over the candidates, and the person themselves, rather than the issues? Or where did it begin? I certainly view it as a negative aspect of our political system.

I mean I f you are going to put every woman to death for being a murderer, since you are in favor of the death penalty for murder, and the fathers have caused the pregnancies which also led to the abortions, so they are accessories to murder, so maybe they should get the death penalty as well, then you will be responsible for murdering a whole lot of people, then you would be a murderer, and then you should be put to death. And then there would be no one left. How does this work with the right to life philosophy if you also beleive in killing everyone?   this is not a rant.

20090129022315AAWQbIi	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Am I being Followed? What do you think and what do you think I should do? Not a joke.?	Okay here is the deal. I caught someone lying in an online publication about me. I put the fool on blast. It was a pretty bad blast because he throws raves and I blew out his past since I've known him forever. He began threatening me and my girlfriend. Telling me I was fucked and I better move on before he does. calling me from behind a restricted number etc. I told him I was going to call the cops. Then I find out he may be involved with something criminally organized. Nothing concrete just a hunch based on who his new friends are. So I decided to publicly apologize to play it on the safe side. When I asked if it was over he purposely left the question open. This was in August.      New Years eve I went outside my apartment to get something out of my car and I noticed a white mid 90s sedan with blacked out windows parked in the parking lot. There was a blue light on the dash, it looked like an LCD screen off of a stereo but it was on top of the dash not in it. When I went down the stairs and was facing the car the blue light was off. I didn't really think anything of it figuring it was an alarm or some ****. So I grab my crap out of the car and head back up the steps. Just as I crest into the cars line of sight I see someone turning off the dome light. I don't think anything of it and head back inside. About 1 1/2 hours later the car is still sitting there so I call the cops. A tow truck shows up just as my girlfriend gets home.....we were weirded out because who sits in their car in a dark parking lot on new years eve and makes sure to turn off any lights so they are not seen?      Next day there is a late 90s black BMW in the parking lot. Again windows totally blacked out. It sat there every night all night until the following Monday (4 days or something like that). It was there again the following friday night. Finally I walked up to the window and peered in, and there was a guy looking like he was asleep. The window was too dark to see if he was faking it or make out any detail. Saturday night he was not there and never returned. This is two weekends in a row that someone is sitting in a parked car outside of our apartment at night.      Yesterday (Wednsday) I'm driving to pick up my girlfriend from work I come up on a red light and pull into the turn lane almost at the last second. All of a sudden the car (a tercel) in front of me does the same thing. I'm thinking what the ****. So I glare at his reflection in the side mirror. He is wearing a beige hoody pulled up with sunglass. and he is staring right back at me. The light turns green and we go around the corner I fall back a little and bust a left hand turn and I don't use my signal on a road he already passed (it lead to my g/f work)I don't really think anything of it.      After we get home about an hour (6:30) later we go walk the dog and in the parking lot next door is two dudes in their early 20s....dressed typically urban. One in a red hoodie the other in a beige hoodie that is pulled up (no sunglasses) They notice me on the balcony across the street and go back to talking. The guy in the beige hoodie is making hard left hand turn gestures with his hands as he talks. We walk the dog around the block and when we come back the two are gone. I don't really think anything of it.      Then we walk the dog for the final time at 8:00pm. No hooded shady people outside as we leave. We walk around the block, as we get halfway down the alley the two dudes in hoodies walk around from the other side of the parking lot planter, where they were sitting, and begin walking through the parking lot towards us. We walked past this planter when we first came out and they were no where in sight. I tell my girlfriend to walk with me away from the guys on the other side of a waist high wall. Then a guy from an apartment we just passed comes out and gets in his car and fiddles with ****. The two hoodie guys then motion back over to the closest side of the planter and sit down. We walk behind them and then come around the planter and walk past them with our back to them. I'm giving them the evil eye the entire time. We head inside. I don't turn on the lights and watch them from the window, about 15 minutes later a car picks them up.      I am seriously freaked out. Couldn't eat my dinner freaked out. I was pretty sure the beige hoodie guy was the same guy from the car. I never saw any features but they both had that long slender face.      Now here is my problem if I go to the cops they will ask why someone would want to follow me, and i'd have to tell them otherwise they would dismiss me. Once they hear my story chances are they would start a investigation. If the dude I blew out really did get involved with something criminal, and I'm pretty sure he did, then I could be seriously fucked.....So what do I do?

20090129031600AAeMlTe	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I am 8 months pregnant and was hit by a 99 centsonly store semi truck what CAN I do?Should I hire an attorney?	I was in the right lane (closet to the curb heading east)and the semi was in the left lane. We were both going the same direction at about the same speed. (30 mph) I was slightly in front of the truck. My rear driverside tire about even with trucks front passenger side tire. All of a sudden the truck begins to merge and smacks the rear quarter panel of my driverside. he was stuck to me until he got back into his lane and stopped. I then pressed the brakes and stopped. My car had turned to the left about 45-50degrees. He did not hit the front of my car at all. We both went thru the next light and pulled over. I am 8 months pregnant and used my hands on the wheel to brace myself not wanting my stomach to hit the steering wheel. I am having pain in my left wrist and elbow as well as my back and neck.The store truck driver did not speak english and called his supervisor who advised him not to call the police, to get my information and give me his also. I do not have a cell phone. It was 6 am wednesday morning and there was no phones around. he would not let me use his phone to call the police. So there was no police report made or filed. We exchanged information. He took pictures of the car and me. After I had his information I drove 9  blocks home. My car is damaged. There is a dent about 2 feet long and .75of an inch deep. Also light on the side is damaged and broken off. My rear tire on the driverside is pushed inward and crooked. It now sits at a slant. the car was pulling left as I drove home. I am completely frazzled and have a lot of anxiety. Also this is too much for a pregnant woman to go thru. Emotionally and mentally. I have no way to get to the doctors now...unless I take an ambulance. I was able to get to the emergency room at 6 pm that night.Much more sore than when the accident occured.They gave me several tests and xrays. determined that I had a strained wrist and neck and back. The baby was fine.      The truck driver is at fault correct??   What kind of claims do I have?   How much can I actually recieve from a settlement?   Someone help me....should I get a lawyer the ones that say that they will file the case with no upfront fees and I pay only if I win the settlement??   Please let me know.....thanks...grateful to be alive...Nicole H

All it will do is help some law firms make money while either closing some businesses down or increasing the cost of their products to the public, because we all know who pays for law suits.

Iceland is in a real pickle, just as Newfoundland was after the great depression.  With all this talk about global warming or climate change, the sovereignty of our Arctic territory is being questioned by Russia, the USA and the Dutch.  Having Iceland being the eleventh Canadian province would be a good way to stake our claim.  Iceland has the best geothermic technology, which we can benefit from.  Much of the Atlantic fishing industry is involved with loans in Iceland, our banks could take over their struggling banks and once again allow money to be borrowed by our fishing industry.  Times are tough but we have been less effected than most and we must seize the opportunity.  The Arctic is going to be an important region from now on.

SAN DIEGO – A San Diego judge has declared a mistrial in a kidnapping and assault case after the defendant smeared excrement on his lawyer's face and threw it at jurors. The judge boosted defendant Weusi McGowan's bail from $250,000 to $1 million after the Monday incident.      Prosecutor Christopher Lawson says McGowan was upset because the judge refused to remove public defender Jeffrey Martin from the case.      McGowan had smuggled a bag of feces into court and spread it on Martin's hair and face before flinging the excrement at jurors. No jurors were hit.      McGowan has pleaded not guilty to kidnapping for robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and other counts in connection with a 2007 home invasion.
