w1lh1INHaa	Okay, I think I'm one of the people who caused you to get concerned.  The issue with Cod Liver Oil for human consumption -- and in many pet varieties --  is the high amount of Vitamin A, which can be problematic in cats.  Normally, cats don't need A supplements if eating a balanced diet.  If these vitamins are specifically designed for cats, it should mean that the levels of Vitamin A have been reduced dramatically.  I  looked up 3V caps but they did not list how much vitamin A is in them.  Please question your vet about possible Vitamin A toxicity.<br>  <br>  I have included a link regarding Cod Liver Oil for pets.  Please scroll down.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.provet.co.uk/petfacts/healthtips/codliveroil.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.provet.co.uk/petfacts/healtht...</a><br>  <br>  ADDED:  Increased Vitamin A in a cat with kidney ailments is often advocated, but please still double check with the vet.  When I answered your previous question, I was not aware, or missed your mentioning any kidney issues, as Vitamin A IS known to help kidney function and tissue regeneration.  So, I apologize, and stand back on my original statements.

Jack Russell terriers are generally fearless and are extremely tough fighters.|`|nFANuZUmaa	Dog Aggression is something that is often more complex than it seems.  For a dog that is aggressive toward other dogs training is an absolute must and you need to work with your dog to be better behaved around other dogs.<br>  <br>  Jack Russels are a wonderful breed but need strong guidance and lots of exercise for the mind and body.  Training will help establish you are his leader and help him to listen to you and your commands.  Never let you dog out off leash since he has had fights and until you have control of his dog aggression and understand what triggers it don't let him be aorund other dogs.<br>  <br>  I recommend you consult a dog trainer and start working with them.  A good trainer knows behavior and can analyze the situations and help put together a program that is tailored ot your dog.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Your dog is dog aggressive.  Some dogs are like that.

vv2uk9hHaa	Like anything else, it probably won't live too long if the dose was high enough. But it's unlikely it was rat poison unless your hawk ate the rat's stomach... There can't have been enough metabolised poison the flesh to kill a hawk. But assuming the hawk ingested a high dose, it would take anything between 16-48 hours to die. Common rat poison causes internal bleeding but it has to be metabolised first. IF the rat poison is strychnine though, it can kill within minutes by muscle paralysis.

oNHtVHzsaa	bunny are great pets. you should only get one to start, and get it in the summer. they love to run around outside if you have a backyard thats not around dogs. IT REALLY IMPORTANT THAT DOGS ARNT AROUND THEY CAN GET HEART FAILURE FROM BEING CHASED! also, they love to be held and if you earn their trust you can do a lot of things with them. they are not that much work, just have a schudule for when you feed them each day and give them timothy hay 2. fill their water often. show your parents you can take care of this adorable animal. good luck|`|RPaHObubaa	May i suggest another animal? This animal is sweet and very smart. They are cleaning themselves 24/7 and don't stink (given you clean their cage often). They are affectionate and are very different compared to the wild version. This animal is a rat. I didn't say it in the beginning because i wanted you to read the whole thing. A way to convince your dad is to say that these pet bunnies are trained to live in cages and all of their parents and ancestors have lived in cages. It is like saying that humans shouldn't live in a house because we once lived in caves. Hope this helped!! Good luck!! Please look into rats!!|`|0zriLTZXaa	Tell him you would take care of it and you wouldnt leave it in the cage 24/7. Bunnies are supposed to stay in a cage and if you leave them roaming around you wouldnt find them again. Plus these days animal shelters are euthenising the animals because they dont have enough money to feed them. That would do the trick.|`|DeUuipSBaa	Tell him it helps to have another pet around, when the time comes.

If you don't have a fence then you can get an outside cage with sides but no top or bottom. you would usually see this used for puppy's but it will work for any animal. these yard cages can be as small as a couple square feet to  reaching past  8 square Meters.

Plus, you'll get bored fast of playing with a rabbit. They don't "play". They just munch all the cables in the house and poop everywhere. They don't like to be held either. Get something more interactive like another dog or mice.. besides, you don't seem to care much if the dog goes or not, so I doubt you'll be be too attached to your rabbit. BUT if in spite of all this, you still want ideas to convince your dad... say you'll get a miniature bunny, so he'll have more space to move around in the cage. And offer to build a fenced enclosure you can put outside in the summer so he can run around without getting lost or attacked. It might convince him. Offer to build it before you buy the bunny.|`|gWCQhXVjaa	Tell them rabbits have to be kept in cages but can be taken out for a few minutes then put them back.

hQ6ZqHjzaa	How will buying her medicine make her stressed? She's more stressed right now because she's ill and your not doing anything about it, she's probably in a hell of a lot of pain and discomfort.And taking a hamster to the vet will hardly cost you anything, I should know I've taken all of my hamsters to the vets when they needed it, it cost me ￡5 which its about $12, and that isn't a lot. When you bought that hamster you bought the responsibility to look after her and includes taking her to the vets when she needs to go. If that was your child or whatever you'd pay the bill to take them to the doctors, or you;d buy them medicine.<br>  <br>  That is wet tail, there isn't a time limit to how long hamsters can live with wet tail. When you purchase a hamster from a store and you find it has wet tail it has usually already had it for a couple of weeks already. Wet tail can be fatal, and if she's had it for a week, I think she may be too far gone especially if she's nto eating.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to buy her some medicine or take her to the vet, because there is no home remedy for wet tail or the runs. Or keep her as hydrated (lots fo water) and comfortable as posisbel and let nature take its course.<br>  <br>  For her eye, she either has an eye infection or some bedding caught in there. My hamster once got bedding caught in ehr eye and it closed up, we caleld the vet and were told to boil some water and add a little salt, not too much, you should not be able to see the salt floating in there. Let the water cool, and use a q-tip to bathe the eye, it should come open eventually, keep doing it till it is. It won;t harm her and is very gentle. If the eye opens and you find that she keeps getting gunk bulding up around, its probably an eye infection and you need to keep bathing it at least twice a day with the salt water.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that if you insist on not going to the vet, you at least try to by her medicine, it will not cause her stress, it will help her and hopefully make her better, becasue I like I said theer no home remedy for this.<br>  <br>  Or you could call a vet and ask for advice on what to do, or what you could give her to make her more comfortable, which is free.  <br>  <br>  If you won't do either, then you need to sort out her eye, give her lots of liquid because she's losing a lot of fluid with her runny poops, so you need to make sure that she is really well hydrated. And make sure her environment is in a quiet stress free place and that she is as comfortable as possible so she can pass in peace|`|gXXCBlVQaa	Hi :)<br>  <br>  Here's what you'll need to do.<br>  <br>  Put a glove on (normally I don't advocate gloves for handling but this is a safety issue for you).<br>  <br>  Get a small bowl and put a treat in it she can't resist.<br>  <br>  While she's distracted with it, very very gently wipe her eye with a warm damp cloth.<br>  <br>  If she fights or rears up at you, take her VERY gently but firmly in your gloved hand and then wipe the eye.<br>  <br>  Hamster eye boogers happen (I'm sure you've woken up with a crusty eye at least once in your life), but if it happens repeatedly, she may be reacting to something in the cage.<br>  <br>  that should do it :)
UbSJPBuNaa	37 gal: 37 pounds<br>  <br>  29 gal: 29 pounds|`|QrjjiOgTaa	the rule of thumb is 1 pound for each gallon|`|nSPZQ6i5aa	If you're not using an undergravel filter, I think the optimal amount is between 1/4 inch and a 1/2 for most freshwater. I guess you would add more where you have a plant you're trying to hold down, mound it up around those types of things, I guess. Also, you might want to check the needs of your particuar fish. Like I have read that guppies prefer a smoother surface, to rest on. Not sure if that is true or not. <br>  <br>  I'm new, so I don't know, but from what I've been trying to figure out, apparently the more gravel you have at the bottom of your tank, the more places for waste to build up at. If you go like 1 and 1/2 to 2 inches deep, (like I did), then your gravel vacuum won't be as effective. So I'm scooping gravel out a few cups at a time now in all three of my current and new tanks, while doing the water change and vacuum. <br>  <br>  Oh yeah, back to the guppies. I figure I'll add some of those glass beads to a protected area, just in case they would like a smoother surface to "sun themselves" on.|`|NHs3LxlLaa	Just do this equation: Length of aquarium (inches) x Width of aquarium (inches) x Desired height of substrate (Inches) ÷ 0.0043. This will give you the amount of gravel you need in Gallons.

IRaIxWJKaa	Try this.  Have the syringe ready but out of sight. Pet her several times, talk quietly to her. then smoothly scruff her at the back of the neck and lift up slightly (not enough to lift her front feet just to raise the head up a bit) and pull backwards slightly.  The lips will open and you can quickly and smoothly shoot the liquid in at the side of the mouth. <br>  <br>  Don't do it from the front, do the fluid from the side.  Hold onto her scruff for a full four seconds to keep her distracted then let her go.<br>  <br>  She may not like it, but it's the easiest way to get it into a cat that's balky.  I never had luck with the towel thing, they turn into octopus cats for me, paws everywhere. And her stitches won't feel good if she's pulled back on her rump and weight shifted into your lap.  <br>  <br>  Two people working this is better, but one person can do it.  Just watch for the front feet to come up to try to knock your hand away.  If you have her head up the right way and bring the syringe in from down low she won't see it till after you squirt it in.|`|LMMSXldBaa	Sometimes, I find it easier to have someone hold my cat and than put the syringe into the back of her throat. However I could never do this because I am a wimp and dont like to see my cat distressed, so I now use wet food. I put out a little bit of wet food and place the medication (either crushed up pill or liquid) in the middle and cover it with more wet food. She always eats it and has never found out our secret :) Hope this helps!|`|Jis9ipcNaa	Toughen up, grab her by the scruff and put the syringe in her mouth, cat's don't take medicine willingly. If you don't want to "aggravate" her, think about the pain she's feeling. Having you uterus removed can't be pleasant.|`|E3SKXPF1aa	You could try to put it on her food but I find my cat won't eat her food if I do that. I say... Toughen up hold her down, but not to hard and don't give in.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	For oral meds I always wrap my cats in a towel(burrito style) with only their head sticking out.  This immobilizes them so they don't struggle.  Stick the syringe in the side of kitty's mouth and give the meds.  Aggravation is a necessary evil when giving meds to cats.  They don't know it's for their own good and you can't talk reason to them.<br>  <br>  Since she'll be wrapped up snugly in the towel, it's probably the safest way to keep from tearing her stitches.  She will be unable to put up a fight thus saving strain on her sutures.  If you happen to be unable to give the meds, she'll be fine without them.  I've had several cats spayed and none of them ever took pain meds after returning home.

iJtuhLMTaa	Its a combination of both.  In any breed bad breeders can produce dogs with such poor temperaments that even the best owner can't counteract it.  On the flip side a bad owner can ruin even the best bred dog either intentionally or through neglecting proper training and socialization.   A well bred dog with proper temperament for its breed with a responsible that knows how to deal with that breeds unique characteristics isn't going to be a problem dog regardless of the breed.<br>  <br>  To use your example of Labs you can get a dog from a breeder that has bred for improper breed type and drive to to the point  that  dogs of their breeding will never be proper hunting dogs even with the best training .  An owner can also buy the best puppy from the best field lines and never do anything with it or punish it for following its retrieving instinct and ruin that dog as a hunting dog.   If the top puppy ends up with a good owner it will thrive as a hunting dog.|`|qioH81tiaa	It's both.<br>  <br>  Yes, you need to train a lab to hunt - but it's easier to train a lab to hunt that to train, say, a cairn terrier.

And terriers are terriers.  <br>  <br>  Behaviour can be bred or trained.  For "pit bulls", IF well bred, they will have varying amounts of dog aggression, but NO human aggression.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most are not well-bred.

With training and a proper understanding of dog behavior any dog can be a wonderful companion.  With improper or misguided handling any dog can develop behavior issues.  A dog, being a domestic animal has been bred to have different traits.  Since you are talking about Pits and Labs I'll go over the things that affect behavior.<br>  <br>  1) Breed<br>  <br>  A dog breed has been selectively bred to make certain traits stand out since they were created  to perform certain jobs.  This means that more likely than not a dog of that breed will have certain traits.  This doesn't mean you won't get a dog in a breed that lacks a trait common or uncommon for that breed since each dog is an individual.<br>  <br>  Pits were bred to fight and kill other dogs in dog fights.  For this reason they often exhibit dog agression and have strong personalities.  They are amzing and loving dogs though.  In my training career I have known many pits that were good with other dogs since they were properly socialized and trained.   Since they most likely will have theses traits a responsible pit bull owner will work to train and socialize the dog to avoid these behaviors.   <br>  <br>  Labs were bred to hunt ducks and work closely with humans.  For this reason they in general are more social to humans they just met, more likely to obey a command quickly, have a drive to chase small animals (espeically birds) and love the water.<br>  <br>  2) Environment<br>  <br>  An untrained, unsocialized Pit Bull is more likely to become aggressive due to its genetics than a lab but I have seen and worked with aggressive labs.  A dog needs to be exposed to as many varying experiences, people, animals and have training/guidance from a person to be well adjusted in as many situations as possible.  The earlier the training the better since people often create problems by thinking of dogs as humans.<br>  <br>  3) Personality<br>  <br>  Every dog is unique and you'll find a wide range of variations in a breed.  I have a Pom that chases small animals though its not bred to be a trait.  Also you can have a lab that loves the water so much he's in it all the time or a lab that only likes to swim on occassion.  <br>  <br>  4) Sex<br>  <br>  A male dog is more likely to be agressive than a female due to gentics and hormones.  Females are more likely to be social.<br>  <br>  5) Spayed/Neutered<br>  <br>  An uneutered male is more likely to be aggressive due to the hormones than a neutered one.  Females will be more aggressive during "that time of the month" or in heat with other females.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  As you can see dog behavior isn't as simple as breed.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	I believe both issues contribute to a bad dog - breeding & ownership.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of bad labs now cuz of over & poor breeding same as for pits but there are more bad owners of pits than labs.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	Pitties are not normally born aggressive we make them that way through neglect, abuse, poor breeding and deliberate training for aggression.  Thats like saying all African Americans are thievs or Mexican Americans lazy,  I know quite a few that are as sweet loving and gentle as any lab. Any dog can be made vicious with the wrong treatment and training.  The Americian Cocker Spaniel has been near the top of the list for most reported dog bites for a couple of years but is not remarked upon as cockers are thought of as cute friendly family dogs
cPjX0dHIaa	It can't be stopped. If she gets that excited that often, the only thing you can really do is try to settle her down.|`|P5CLeokmaa	Oh hunnie..<br>  <br>  I always have this happen..<br>  <br>  just all i can say keep all glass items high on a shelf, but saftly pushed back toward something more sold, like they can jump and knock it over, or run through he house and CRASH goes the antique vase..<br>  <br>  it really doesn't change your love for the animal..just aggarvated.|`|I7ZOgAsVaa	We tought our dog the tail down command it was really easy  when she was around things we just told her tail and would gently grab her tail and push it down now when she goes around tables etc wagging we just say tail and she puts it down and stops knocking things over.|`|LJ9hyvg2aa	make her sadder. dont feed her dont look at her and definatley dont talk to her.<br>  <br>  I wouldnt recommend this but if you want her to stop wagging this will do the trick!<br>  an alternative is to cut it off|`|U9Ol972Baa	Try not getting her excited by talking real high pitch to her. She will still get excited but if you don't encourage it, it probably won't be as violent. Just try to calm her down and maybe move things higher if they are breakable.|`|gse1455saa	She wags when she is happy and that is a good thing.  My black Lab broke lamps and knocked down kids for 15 years.  Now, it is a fun memory.|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Not much you can do....other than taking him out to a no glass zone when he is excited.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	There isn't much you can do. She is wagging her tail out of happiness and/or excitement. If she knows the command "lie down" just tell her to do that.|`|RqeoCyzYaa	good-luck with that! my pitty does the same thing she loves everything and everyone, she will knock things down with it, even if shes sitting.|`|AA11244754	You have got to be joking!  You can't "get her to wag her tail less" clearly you know noth-thing about dogs or else you would know that is how they show that they are happy and excited.|`|MaDN7knJaa	She/He is VERY happy when he/she wags. It is a sign for saying, "I'm happy!".

MH4BYgxjaa	I have two cats that wheeze. One of them has an enlarge thyroid and a heart murmur, the other is allergic to cats (I know, what are the odds). There's not real way to determine what is causing the wheezing other then to take him to a vet. A typical visit/check u runs about 65 to 90, not including shots or medications. <br>  <br>  My vets told me not to worry about it unless it gets really bad and it looks like they're having trouble breathing. I know it's really worrisome, but in the mean time, rub his back or tummy in small, slow circles. It may not do much for the wheezing but it gives you a purpose other then worrying and I found it soothes the kitties.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Well, what breed is it? I have a baby oriental and I find he does that because that breed has been selected for narrow snouts. So the airways are rather smaller than in regular cats. So he sneezes often and wheezes and coughs. But he's still a little devil. If it gets worse, it could be a degenerative disease of the muscles where he can't breathe properly anymore.  And they almost always wheeze  a little when they purr.|`|E3SKXPF1aa	I think you'll find a lot of cats do that!|`|cRjRZ2lEaa	He could be trying to cough up a hairball if he is wheezing some.<br>  <br>  It sounds like he is coughing.  One of my cats has had problems with colds, and they can get really bad if they go untreated. <br>  <br>  The energy level can be a telltale sign, but not always. My kitten who has had these problems still played a lot when he first got his cold.<br>  <br>  You should bring him to the vet and get him looked at.  Better to get it looked at now, in case it is a problem, before it gets worse.

7KxQXHzOaa	it's a German Shepard / boarder Colly/ lab mix.<br>   I'm positive for sure|`|bIaywrBCaa	I would say german shepherd/lab mix. Definitely German shepherd|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Looks like a collie type but whatever he is, sorry he could be a she, you've got a lovely looking dog there - if your unsure of his/hers heritage and someone asks you what breed he/she is then just say they're a Heinz 57 - lots of varieties but always the best!|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	I'd say German Shepherd for sure and maybe Lab too.|`|53giV6PFaa	What about a husky - lab mix.

tPGxPDvBaa	Sounds like normal shedding & yes shedding is just starting depending on where you live. Puppies don't shed the same way as they do with adult coats & it is different hair. Other than taking him in the groomers for a better brush & blow out a couple of times - brush, brush, brush. You might want to add fish oil capsules to his food for a lil extra help but every hair on their body has to come out at some point & grown back.|`|JsBb732Maa	Yes, he's blowing his coat. Look for a furmanater, it's a great shedding brush and you can also get the shampoo to help with the shedding.I've seen them on e bay.|`|jZGg0gNKaa	Huskys "blow coat" twice a year. I think this is what you're experiencing. Mine LOVE to be vacuumed, but it freaks other dogs out. You just need to brush them everyday. Having the groomer blow them out also helps get all the fur out. Ours last maybe 2 weeks, but we have 2 so it overlaps a little bit. As long as you don't see bald spots, don't be over concerned.|`|CaQTKNKyaa	Oh the joys of huskie's enjoy it. It's very hard to stop a husky from shedding. Believe me. Our back yard looked like a blanket. After four brushes and the same amount in combs. We finally found a good brush. It cost us $100 dollars but it works.It pulls the hair from the roots And they're shed their coats with the change in season. All I can really offer you is to get a real good book on huskies and read lots of luck.<br>  <br>                             lesley|`|CEgq26oHaa	Yes, this is normal for your husky.  You might want to increase the time you brush him, to like 15-20 minutes a day.  It's been years since I had my husky, but I think it was like 1 or 2 months before this stopped.|`|qTHUpqKTaa	it's very normal for a husky. My friend has a husky and she sheds a lot.<br>  Just try brushing her daily a LOT.<br>  if she doesn't have any health problems, i don't think it really matters that much.|`|E7JjLeSxaa	When dogs live inside and not outside 24/7 they can blow their coats more than just twice a year. It has to do with artificial lighting and things like that. Anyway try fish oil or brewer's yeast as a supplement brush brush brush, and have patience!
Yp15y9zRaa	My dog also has these and he is a very active 13 year old. We took him to the vet and were told that it was purely due to his old age and that 'all dogs get them' - the vets words not mine. <br>  <br>  More than likely your dog has also developed these simply due to old age, but to be honest I would recommend you take your dog to the vet like we did to make 100% sure that there is nothing seriously wrong. It may cost a fortune just to walk through the door of a vet (lol) but I guess it's better to be safe than sorry!|`|AA10265922	yes you should be worried,get it to the vet soon as you can,they can find out what the matter is|`|7KxQXHzOaa	Take her to the vet and ask her/him to take a look at the bumps on her chest/ribs and her side|`|UtYRJvo9aa	If you feel these bumps and it feels like they are localized to the skin that is a good thing.  Many older dogs get lipomas - fatty tumors.  These tumors localize to the skin and will not lead to any type of cancer.  The best thing you can do is to see the vet and have a biopsy done.  Good luck and try not to worry too much.|`|HEdGGmkhaa	I can't see it but it could be anything from a former injection site, a calcium deposit, a cyst or something more serious like a tumor.<br>  <br>  I would ask your vet next time you are scheduled to go there or just make an appt asap.|`|AA11244754	You should take her in to make sure that there IS nothing to worry about.  Remember: better safe than sorry.  You would feel horrible if you didn't do it then it turned out that your dog had cancerous tumors|`|gse1455saa	Might be fatty tumors, maybe not.  See your vet and have them looked at.|`|W4UOmlilaa	dont panic yet ,shes an older dog and they do get harmless growths.when you feel them do they feel attached to the bone or just skin.my dog is 17yrs so she has a lot of bumps.just to put your mind at rest get your vet to check it out.good luck|`|ce41R9gFaa	if you have changed food it could be a allergic reaction. but than again it could be a form of cancer i hope everything is ok good luck<3|`|AA11090106	take roxy to the vet
bbc411996e4ce78be28c880823cac5b8aa	It's perfectly normal for testes to "drop" at that age.  I wouldn't rush to neuter him this young.  I'd wait until he has finished his vaccination series and is between 4-6 months of age.|`|gse1455saa	He is fine.  It is a little early but it is fine.  You can have him fixed whenever you want but I'd wait until he is just a little bigger.  4-5 months or so just because they have to knock him out and the bigger he is the better he'll do.|`|AA10210947	yes that is normal.   Most vets recommend neutering at 4-6 months of age.|`|bIaywrBCaa	I call them dropped when you can actually see them. Some people say dropped when you can feel them. Most pups testicles have not "dropped" by my definition until after 4 months, usually 6. The earliest I have had a male fixed was 4 1/2 months.|`|bZhIEy1Waa	He's completely normal - stop worrying! the vet wouldn't have said anything about having him neutered yet because he's got a long, long way to go before he faces that hurdle bless him ha ha. He'll be sexually mature before he's a full year old so just keep an eye on him - frisky little bleeders they are ha ha. Trust me, you'll know when he needs the snip - he'll be humping your elbow or cushions like a demon!!! All the best.|`|AA11244754	you can easily get him neutered now, try watching Animal Planet's Animal Heroes their vets neuter as early as 6 weeks.|`|nctxHm8Qaa	Yes, perfectly normal.  Neutering him between 5-6 months of age should be just fine.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	its normal i would wait till he's about 4-5 months|`|Wo0AWgYVaa	Most vets will want to do neutering EARLY!!!  They will tell you the dogs will mark indoor, will be aggressive, will roam around to get bitches in heat....What they did not tell you is the harm of taking away the sex hormone too early.<br>  <br>  Testosterone is the hormone you take away when you neuter a dog....it's not only for sexual development, this is an important hormone for proper skeletal and muscular growth.  It's not that bad in small breed, but in larger breed such as mine (Newfoundland)...if you neuter them before physical maturity, it will cause future bone problem.<br>  <br>  And about those marking, aggressive behaviour are over exaggerated.  None of my friends' non-neutered dogs mark indoor...and I personally see more aggressive neutered dogs in the dog park than non-neutered ones. <br>  <br>  If I were you, I would wait till your dog has reached physical maturity first before neutering.  It won't be that long because you have a toy breed.  My one, I need to wait till closed to two years old.  But testosterone also means a bit more challenging teenager stage.  So regardless of the breeds, invest greatly in training.
Ulme5ewraa	My kitten did that when he was little too, although not to that extent.  I don't think it's so much the tail that fascinates them, but more anything that moves.  She just doesn't realize that the tail is a part of her yet.  As for her going crazy over the tail it probably just means she has alot of energy.  After a while, she will move on to bigger and better things.  For my cat, bigger and better things means shadows.  He is 8 months old now and will follow me everywhere attacking my shadow all day long.  If you really want to have fun, go to the store (i got mine at wal-mart), and get a mouse that moves when you put batteries in it.  Theyre like $5-10.  My cat was scared at first but once he worked up the courage he played with that thing for like 3 hours straight.  It doesn't work on carpet though so if you don't have any tile of wood it won't work.  I don't think the tail chasing is anything to be worried about, she will outgrow it in a few weeks or months.  Good Luck.|`|e124e8765c4b0ed9c4d1ca5f0af5f848aa	Heheheh, I wish you had a video of her chasing her tail!!!|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Perfectly normal! My kitty does it too (he's one year old) and he runs around in circles chasing his tail then starts chewing on it.  It's just the hunting instinct I guess... since they can't chase small furry things in the fields, they chase the first small furry thing they see: their tail.  ^-^ just make sure she doesn't fall down the stairs will doing that. Mine did. O_o; well.... he fell down A stair. He's fine.
1gDTiPVyaa	Yes, you almost certainly have a boy. Congratulations!  I had one who went after one of his cage toys all the time. Unfortunately it had a bell on it and he made it ring ALL THE TIME! He was....enthusiastic.  Better that it was the toy than my female 'tiel--she'd have probably murdered him if she hadn't been half afraid of him. As it was, he'd get amorous and put his foot (way up high, for him) on her back and she's flip him with her wings and send him tumbling and reeling. Little bugger would come back just like a little green boomerang. He did the whole chirping, singing head bobbing dance for her.  It was really cute.<br>  <br>  On YouTube--look up Minka the budgie--there's a couple of really funny ones of him and that'll help you confirm it. His behavior is.....unmistakable.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	It sounds like a horny boy Budgie.<br>  I have a tiel that humps his perch.|`|24b558aaf77e8dc4e04518b037561692aa	Many birds love to chase our feet, this isn't uncommon.<br>  <br>  Female birds that are hormonal stick their tail/fannies up in the air.<br>  With a female bird you don't want to encourage this. Don't cuddle too much, don't rub under the wings and don't rub their backs, these are sex spots for birds.<br>  Female birds can develop egg's with or without a male bird and some times the female can become egg bound, a life threatening situation that needs prompt Avian Vet attention.<br>  <br>  Male birds masturbate on toys, perch's, arms, hands,what ever they can use. Male hormonal birds can become aggressive also, toward us and towards any female bird that rejects him, often biting and some times killing the hen.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped.<br>  <br>  For more information try - <a href="http://www.birdchannel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdchannel.com/</a><br>  and  <a href="http://www.birdsnways.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdsnways.com/</a>|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	Your budgie is male.

Mine would talk until I got him a friend, he hasn't spoken since.|`|UxuDuwUWaa	Get your budgie a female,
XI2iylR4aa	I don't really know much about ferrets, but here's what I know about rabbits:<br>  1.They like to get pet, though they might not always like to be held.  But we cuddle with our bun by lying down next to her on the floor.<br>  2. Our bun had a troubled past and used to bite, but now she doesn't bite at all.  I'd say that once your bunny gets used to you, if you treat him well, he won't bite.<br>  3.  Our bun doesn't smell at all.  She is litter trained, and if we change her litterbox every day, or every other day, it doesn't smell.<br>  4.  I'll admit, bunnies do poop a lot, but they're firm and compact, and don't smell very much, so it's not really a big deal.<br>  5.  Buns aren't the very easiest pets you can get, but once you know what you need to know, they are easy.  They do require excellent care, a specific diet, and regular vet care, but that really goes for any animal.<br>  <br>  If you're considering a rabbit, I highly recommend checking out<br>  <a href="http://www.rabbit.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.rabbit.org</a><br>  You'll find a lot of great info.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Cuddly....both I find are equally cuddly, but it depends on the personality of the individual...not the species.<br>  Bites A Lot....again, depends on the individual, but mind you, ferrets are known to carry rabies. Rabbits, too, but not as well known as ferrets.<br>  Stink....If you de-scent the ferret, you won't have much of a problem as long as you clean the cage on a weekly basis. Rabbits are the same way, yet they do not need de-scenting.<br>  Poop More....Rabbits, definately...but their poop is contained in little pellets that are easy to clean up.<br>  Easier to Take Care of....I personally think ferrets are better (even though I have owned rabbits for 18 years). Rabbits are very delicate and need very specific feeding regimens. Ferrets don't have the sensitive digestive systems that rabbits do.<br>  <br>  All in all, if this is your very first pet besides a dog or cat, I would recommend getting a ferret. Make sure you know the laws of your area, though. Some states and even cities won't allow ferrets as pets.|`|XJEGTZJqaa	Rabbit!<br>  1-Rabbit<br>  2-Ferret<br>  3-Both<br>  4-Rabbit<br>  5-Rabbit wins by alot!<br>  GOOD LUCK IF UR GETTING  A RABBIT!|`|CpUJI8adaa	i like ferrets, but they stink . worse than cat. i would play it safe and get the rabbit they don't smell bad.and your room wont stink ferrets are cute though, but they stink bad. but, you can get the gland removed.thaat causes them to stink BUT i heard that removing the gland is also abd for there health, play if safe and get the rabbit and name it bugsy. good luck.|`|0R2EQvMiaa	RABBITS!<3<br>  <br>  1 rabbits!<br>  2 ferrets<br>  3 ferrets!<br>  4 ?<br>  5 rabbit<br>  Ferrets are VERY stinky!....|`|5M57TTfpaa	i would get a rabbit, for the simple fact that the stink less(but they do still smell i will be honest), and because they require less attention. they still need attention and time to roam about outside the cage, but ferrets get really bored and need lots of attention.<br>  <br>  1 cuddly... well that depends on your animal. some rabbits and ferrets like to snuggle with you, and some dont.<br>  2 bites... this also depends on the animal. ferrets tend you chew on you alot, and i have heard they do bite alot as well. when a rabbit bites it really hurts! i have never been bit by a ferret, just nibbled by a baby one. not all bite though. my doe rabbit has bit me twice in almost 2 years, and my buck has never. <br>  3 stink.. like i said before i think ferrets stink more. their bodies even stink, whereas a rabbits body usually does not. and if you keep up with the rabbit cage/litter box like you should, it wont end up stinking.<br>  4 poop... rabbits. but at least they poop in little pellets and you can just go around after them and pick them all up lol. this is what i do when my doe gets let out. as soon as she is free, she leaves a poop trail everywhere she goes, which is everywhere. my male is litter trained though, so he doesnt do this. ferrets poop really stinks, and its all wet. if they did it on your carpet it would prob stain.<br>  5 i have never cared for a ferret. in my opinion rabbits are easy, but you do have to feed and give water everyday, and change the cage every 5 days or so, unless they are litter trained(which should be cleaned every day or 2 to avoid smell). ferrets can be litter trained as well, so might be just as easy to take care of, but like i said, i dont know i have never had one.  i do know that ferrets need to be out and play ALOT whereas with a rabbit, an hour a day or something like that is mostly all you need to do.<br>  <br>  good luck with your new pet!!|`|fzaf5t3Caa	i would reccomend a ferret but i have both ferrets and a rabbit.

They both need a lot of attention and love. I can't choose.<br>  <br>  I really think you should get a ferret even if those 5 things sound lke a turn off. they are really fun animals. I have two of them and enjoy them soooo much =]|`|gmkUgFx5aa	a rabbit is more cuddly<br>  ferrets bite more <br>  ferrets stink more<br>  rabbits poop more (it's easier to clena up though)<br>  rabbit are probably easier to take care of, they arnt much work<br>  <br>  i would go with the rabbit my friend has a ferret and he bites so hard he draws blood on her evey time. but if you want a pet that is hyper and plays a lot then get a ferret. rabbits are the laid back kind of pets.|`|AA10936767	I personally would have a ferret. More exciting and will be worth the messes that they make. Rabbits are cute but not as fun as a ferret. Also, rabbits tend to have more medical issues.

I believe the over all satisfaction and bonding is great with a ferret than it is with a rabbit. I've owned both.<br>  <br>  1. Really depends on the animal. All 3 of my ferrets love to cuddle whn they are tired out from running around the apartment chasing each other and playing. My 2 rabbits are cuddlers but then again they never run around and play with each other like ferrets do.<br>  2. My ferrets do bite a little more but over the two years I've had them I've never been bit hard. They like to play nip your pant leg or occasionally a finger just to get your attention and say "Hey! I want you down here and playing now!" This goes for my last ferrets to. And ferrets are very easily trained not to bite at all. My last group of carpet sharks had a really bad biter (she was neglected and abused) but with a little work it's an easily taken care of problem.<br>  3. Ferrets do have a musk on them but honestly, the people that say "Oh, they smell so bad" either 1, don't properly take care of their ferrets, or 2, know someone that has far too many or doesn't take care of their ferrets properly. A problem like that is easily solved by doing a light cleaning of the cage daily. Which takes not even 5 minutes, and NOT bathing them all the time. When you over bathe a ferret it strips oils off their skin and their bodies have to work over time to replace them which makes them smell worse. I bathe mine once every two months making sure their cage is properly cleaned daily.<br>  4. Bunnies poop way more frequently but only very small amounts at a time. Ferrets poop less frequently and always in the corner of the room or if you train them in a litter box. Mine took less than a couple of weeks, to litter train.<br>  5. Bunnies are extremely easy to take care where as ferrets will require a decent amount of time. For ferrets expect to have them out at least 4 hours a day, and hour of which should be spent with you directly playing with them.<br>  <br>  I recommend ferrets. They are far more fun to play with and are the more rewarding experience. I recommend getting at least two. If you do that it will require less of your time to pay attention and play with them, but once you get them, you'll realize you want to spend tons of time with them. <br>  <br>  Also it's a common misconception that ferrets are known to carry rabies like people have said on this board. Only 12 cases of Rabies have been documented in ferrets EVER. That's since they started keeping records in 1957 and there has NEVER been a case of a ferret passing rabies to a human. So have fun with whatever you choose and I hope that this helped.
i3twJsCLaa	Some cool things are:<br>  <br>  A plastic igloo<br>  A wheel<br>  A Bedroom or Living room playset, (they sell them at petco,)<br>  <br>  I bought all these for my hamster and he loves them!!|`|sXEewjUoaa	a wheel thing if hes really active|`|lW2d7m9Baa	an igloo! my hamster hammy loved his!|`|3e0rDOWTaa	if you havent already got a wheel you will need to get one. not a wire one as this can hurt the hamsters feet. I recommend the mini silent spinner.<br>  -an igloo or hideout.<br>  -chew toys.<br>  -tubes.<br>  - puzzle playgrounds make great toys too!
Eg1G2mvVaa	No, you can only tell if you can turn someone into a newt (they will get better).|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No, not if it is a 140lb duck...|`|u1HahCoqaa	No, you either have a really fat duck or are like just a leg. (Not even a whole human- the human skeleton alone weighs more than a duck)|`|AA11070782	No your another duck.|`|sxTeKrjwaa	are you callin me a witch LOLOLOLOL.  <br>  wait i dnt think it means that|`|fqVxw8HMaa	..maybe an infant baby.|`|jw4DqiCraa	No - this was just a test that was used when the 'which trails' were in action. If you were the same weight as a duck then you were said to be a witch and you would be killed. Thousands of Innocent women were killed due to these witch trials, as many of the tests were unfair and bias.<br>  I hope this helps! <br>  :)|`|mWZ9BXIdaa	Yes. But if you were a witch you could cast a spell so that you didn't weigh the same as a duck which would make you not a witch....but then if you're not a witch you couldn't have cast the spell...hmmm<br>  <br>  your quackers!|`|8nF5YjyYaa	My c*ck weighs as much as a duck, but it's a wuck, half way between a witch and a willy.|`|RTCKiu03aa	no its a swan that weighs the same as a witch|`|v811KD7raa	no sweety youre not|`|HmWSssa7aa	no your a *********
2Ku4DuvCaa	It makes me think someone has done things that are less than kind to him with their hands before. This isn't an easy fix, but there are ways to go about it.<br>  <br>  Introduce him to some treats, and figure out which one he likes the best. When you've done that, you can keep those treats close by so that you can encourage him to come near your hands.<br>  <br>  First, you'll want to do this somewhere that he can't immediately run away from you. For example, while he's in his cage. Reach into his cage with one of those treats between your fingers, and offer it to him. Let him take it. This will take a few times, but when he's no longer too afraid to take them out of your hand, start holding the treat firmly between your fingers. <br>  <br>  Whenever you approach him with your hands, keep your hands open and move them very slowly so that he can clearly see what they're doing. When he seems comfortable with eating the treat while you hold it, that's when you want to teach him a control command such as "step up." This teaches your bird to step onto your finger.  Push your finger(s) toward his feet, SMILE, and say "Step up" in a happy voice, <br>  <br>  The odds he does it the first time are very slim. However, with the proper encouragement, he will learn that your hands only want to give him cuddles and treats, not hurt him.<br>  <br>  Again, this will take time. I've never been able to get a bird to recover even partially from a fear of hands in under a month. But if you're patient and persistent, he will come around.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!
e7773rspaa	I've seen blood pythons that drool and had a boa that did that.  Very different than an RI.  If everything checks out and you haven't had any problems before, I'd say you do have just a drooly snake.|`|01e20da0d169c7d0c6c0a2c2631a8036aa	If I was you I would take him to the vet. Snakes can get infections and if he has one he will need a shot. Make sure to keep an eye out for any other signs. Like how does his nose look? Is it dry? Is he eating?<br>  Make sure his cage is warm... <br>  Hope your guy is ok.....|`|6j9EZXGWaa	That is not normal, he needs to see a vet before this gets worse and more expensive to treat. Make sure the temperatures in his cage are correct, even at night.|`|iB22RWkGaa	Go to the vet!
qTHUpqKTaa	try saying ah-ah harshley (not THAT harsh) when you see him eating...<br>  my cousin's poodle cannot keep himself from licking everything and it worked when i said that everytime he licked<br>  <br>  i think it means something when you say ah-ah ... it was from victoria stilwell's training.. i forget.|`|bZhIEy1Waa	For him to be eating glass etc suggests a brain imbalance rather than just missing his favourite food!!! I'd get him to a vet asap my friend, i think you're having to deal with something you can't remedy at home. All the best x|`|AA11090106	maybe take your dog to the vet or get it new food or dog toys or a bone or something hope your dog gets better|`|ByatbHbzaa	i would take him to the vet he could have a tape worm or anothersort of parasite
IbDcAXsaaa	Well, I would suggest a gerbil, but they are very much like hamsters and seeing you don't want any hamsters, a gerbil would be too original... I would suggest a rat if anything. Rats are fun loving creatures that love their handlers as a dog would, if you have had a dog. Rats will tend to get large, and pee a lot making them smell. You will have to pay for a cage specially made for them, or they can get out of an unsuitable cage, or get respiratory problems from a tank of any size, even a five foot long tank. You have to buy something with levels for them to run in, wheels, and safe bedding... so let us start with pricing... and I'll compare to gerbils. By the way, gerbils are desert rodents, a very beautiful species of the small animal family. Long, furry tails with tufts at the end. Slender, soft, but very very very fast. They don't attach to "their" humans, but they will get more familiar and learn to not be AS scared, but will run when you pick them up, unless you spend a super amount of time with them to tame them. Anyhow, lets start adding the dollar amount :-)<br>  <br>  Rats- One rat will cost $5 to $8 each.<br>  Gerbils- one gerbil will cost anywhere from $8 to $15, don't ask why they are more expensive.<br>  <br>  Rats- A cage will be at least $60 if not more. $60 is actually pretty cheap unless you get a crappy plastic based cage with no levels.<br>  Gerbils- They are good in tanks, so a 10 gallon tank should cost about $20 to $30.<br>  <br>  Rats- Rat needs are hammocks, which you can find on ebay or amazon for super cheap. They also love wheels, and they love chewing on blocks, so this will range from $30 to $40 if you get hammocks. If you purchase hammocks from Petco which are about $20 in average, on ebay or amazon they are about $4 on average. They will need huts/houses to sleep in, which need to be large because rats love to sprawl out and hide things in their little "secret" dens. So cute to watch them pack things in there.<br>  Gerbils- Gerbils HAVE TO chew, this is a need, or they chew everything in their habitat. They have to have a wheel, or they gain pounds rapidly. They don't need hammocks, but will enjoy levels.. but again it isn't a NEED they have to have in their habitat. They, as well as all rodents, need a house or cover for privacy and taking naps in.<br>  <br>  Rats- They like rat blocks, basically food compressed into a large pill, and they enjoy these. I heard Kaytee isn't a good brand though, but I use it... :-) This should cost $4 to $7. Rats love trying new foods, but don't feed anything citrus. They will kill for bananas, lettuce, broccoli, and celery. Well mine do!<br>  Gerbils- There are many select choices for gerbils/hamsters, as you might know. The mixed food isn't good because they pick the seeds out of the mix, which is fattening. You can make your own mixtures, and feed them few human items. They get sick easy though so I stay away from human food, unless its like seeds or peanuts.<br>  <br>  Rats- Rats need so much attention its crazy. If you play with them a lot they will get more tame, and will WANT to come out.<br>  Gerbils- Low maintenance creatures, and don't really like to be held, but there are those rare occasions where you get a relaxed gerbils who dies to be held. Which, again, is rare.<br>  <br>  Rats- You will get a lot more sleep with these guys if you sleep with them in your room.<br>  Gerbils- No sleep. They get annoying... no make that super annoying haha.<br>  <br>  Rats- Rats might need to see a vet, so don't be surprised if your rat gets a tumor (which is very common) and leaving with a $100 vet bill.<br>  Gerbils- Rarely go to the vet and don't have very many health cautions as rats.<br>  <br>  So really its up to you. They are both great animals, but you have to pay more to get more. Rats will, in the long run, be your best friend where gerbils will kind of stay the same. Rats have more health cautions than gerbils and will most likely get a tumor, but males are less prone to tumors than females. Male rats are more laid back, females love exploring. Gerbil males and females are the same in my experiences. Anyways, I don't want to bore you... if you have any questions then just email me. I'm always up for a chat. Good luck with your decision.<br>  <br>  By the way... I had a rabbit too and a guinea pig. Guineas are very, very social and love being held. They don't bite unless in danger. I heard bunnies can be mean... form my experience mine was mean. I know people who love their bunnies, I also know people who hate them. You take the risk... read on Guinea Pigs. They are more expensive but will live longer than gerbils or rats. Anywho... yeah just email me with questions! Good luck, again :-)<br>  <br>  Edit: Gerbils are the first steps to rats... They are just a step below the rat in maintenance, time, care, and cost. If you like gerbils, you will love rats :-)|`|kAKMkmfZaa	I can't believe you wouldn't want a guinea pig we had one and he was the greatest, they do not have a very long life span and that would be the bad thing about them. Ours had his own personality, he would get mad and make all kinds of noise if we ignored him he use to sleep in the bed with my son he would not go to the bathroom unless he was in his cage he just roamed around in his room freely when we were home, they can be trained and very good pets.|`|EEmvWLCKaa	I SALE RAT AN MICE <br>  THERE EAT ANYTHINK YOU GIVE THEM <br>  I SELL MY RAT$5.00 MICE$3.00<br>  YOU SHOULD SEE MY LOT|`|DeUuipSBaa	Guinea pig, rat, chinchilla. They are way diffrent from bunnies|`|gXXCBlVQaa	i think a rat would be good =]|`|vUoEgKxpaa	well your very wrong about guinea pigs, there nothing like rabbits, they dont have long legs to kick you, and as far as i can tell they would be in your price range, because ferrets cost more then 100 and so do chinchillas, but maybe you could try a mouse or gerbil or rat. well i have guinea pigs and chinchillas so i guess prices on them wouldnt help.... sorry but you should really give guinea pigs a second chance there really awesome pets.|`|fzaf5t3Caa	i would say a ferret but alone they are over $130. I have two and they are great pets. How about if you get a chinchilla or a sugar glider?good luck|`|9YDlJMlEaa	Rats are fun, as are chinchillas, even though they seem a little out of your price range, but you could look for one on craigslist, people will usually have one for under a hundred with cage! hope i could be of help! btw, i don't understand why u don't like guinea-pigs, i have had many of them and i love them!|`|hC4Z8HIbaa	Rats do make good pets, but in order to get a decent cage that has enough room for them, you would need to spend over $100. Have you considered mice or gerbils? I don't know much about them, but I do know that if you are not willing to spend more than $100 in the animal, a rat is not a good choice. I have 2 rats that I am keeping in a cage that costs $200 (but can hold up to 10 rats), a sewing machine I bought to make hammocks and fleece liners for the cage (but you could buy hammocks and liners if you wanted to), not to mention food and vet costs. I would say that although rats do make wonderful pets, I do not think rats would be a good option for you.|`|RPaHObubaa	A rat is really wonderful. Try to forget everything that you hear about wild rats because they are totally different. They are very sweet. They have been known to even sit with people and watch TV.  They are very smart, as a matter of fact, they are the smartest rodent except for maybe squirrels. They can even learn stuff like their names and tricks! They are (contrary to belief) very clean and don't eat trash. They are cleaning them selves 24/7. The only bad thing is that they only live to be about 3 years. They will cost anything from $3 to $20s depending on the store. The cages cost about $40-$60 (i would suggest a mettle bottom but not a mesh bottomed cage). Food varies from $10-$12. They are the best pets i have ever had (and trust me i have had all types of pets: Gerbils, guinea pigs, hamsters, ferrets, bunnies, and even dogs, and cats, and i have still yet to find a pet better that rats.)  I know that i will never be without a rat for the rest of my life. Another good thing is that they are very low maintenance. Good luck!! Sorry i don't have any price comparisons!! Hope this helps!! Please look into them!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: only very big cages cost over 100 dolars if you buy a normal sized cage, i will only cost between $40-$60|`|yUbS5Ou0aa	I love Gerbils. I have four males right now, Sox, Derby, Emmett and Stark. They are so much fun. They are a bit more expenisive than hamsters or mice but are really fun. They aren't nocturnal or diurnal so they have a mixed sleep pattern they sleep some in the day and some at night. I bought Sox and Derby for a full priced everything lol it totaled about like this-<br>  <br>  $80-Cage and topper<br>  $16-Gerbils<br>  $09-Food <br>  $15-Bedding(Not ceder or pine)<br>  $15-food and water dishes/bottles<br>  thats about $135 but the extra money is so worth it. I love my boys to death and they are super spoiled. Every chance i get i'm buying them new toys or making them something new. They are very curious animals and are really fun. They need to be kept in groups of two or more though as they are very social animals thats why its $16 for them.<br>  <br>  Anouther good pet for you would be a mouse. They are just adorable and can be fun also. lets see its been a while since i've owned one of those but i think this would be a reasonable estimate-<br>  <br>  $30-Cage<br>  $04-Mice- again they need to be kept in groups<br>  $09-Food<br>  $15-Bedding<br>  $15-food and water dishes/bottles<br>  <br>  thats a total of $73 they are cheeper than Gerbils but they don't provide the hours of entertainment Gerbils do. i've also heard rats make very good pets but i've never had one myself because moms scared of them. But i would think they would be about the same if not a little more than the gerbils. :-] good luck finding a new pet! hope i helped!<br>  <br>  Also- Gerbils are nothing like hamsters and no where near as popular all of the petstores near us have stopped selling them because they don't sell well. I actually just bough Emmett and Stark today for 20 bucks and that was the two gerbils plus their cage, wheel, bedding and a food dish because they were the last two gerbils they had left in the store and they were not going to sell them anymore. And from my expieriances from my five+ hamsters and 5 gerbils, gerbils are much much more friendly
28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	I have Checkered Giants, and not only do they have big cages because they are a bigger breed they have to be on wood flooring (not cage wire). So yes it is cruel. And especially the staff to say that its there because nobody likes it. Maybe THEY should try and make it like people.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I've known of Flemish Giants (can grow to 20lbs) being kept in a cage that really only suits a rabbit of 7lbs or less. I don't know of the "Pets at Home" place you're talking about, never heard of the place, but if it's being kept in an enclosure that it can not fully stretch out in, it's best that you call animal control. Rabbits require plenty of room to run and get their exercise. Doesn't matter if he doesn't like people, he shouldn't be kept in a small cage.|`|XJEGTZJqaa	Yes, it should be put to sleep!
ZTkHbVHOaa	Its probably just its normal breath, they don't keep their sweet kitty breath.  or teeth problems, doubt it if you say its fat. remember they cant brush their own teeth like we do.|`|AA10091923	Nelly-<br>  <br>  i remember my vet telling me about a few things "this bothers u more than the cat"...and stinky breath is one of those things.<br>  <br>  but you can go to the local pet store and purchase a small tooth brush or a finger brush with pet toothpase and start brushing her teeth.<br>  <br>  the other FREE thing you can do, is contact your local vet and ask what you can give your cat for bad breath.  this will cost you nothing for the phone call - just the product.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|0zriLTZXaa	He needs to get medicine for his gums. He has stinky breath because he has tartar on them. Take him to the vet and they will give you medicine for his gums. It worked on my cat.|`|AA10210947	If you are concerned take him to the vet to rule out dental disease or kidney disease.|`|GtqdaAGZaa	I would have to say, theres nothing you can do. <br>  and hes rotting from the inside out.<br>  Good luck!
32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	maybe it's his food, hairballs, or gastric cancer <br>  <br>  "eh..2 weeks maybe"  wow, how kind of you to allow your cat to be sick for two weeks before calling for an appt. with the vet<br>  <br>  would you do this with a human infant?|`|AA10091923	its probably not vomit...but hairball...hairball is a tenuous term...cause it never looks like a ball and unless you want to look closely may not see the hair...but it is a regurgitation of food that cannot be digested due to hair blockage.<br>  <br>  get some petroleum jelly (at pet store in cat section)...put a small amount on their front paw and they will lick it and it should help.<br>  <br>  good luck  :)|`|flKkoiwbaa	My cat is a chronic barfer . . . <br>  <br>  After many trips to the vet, blood tests, and 3,000 different kinds of food, it all came down to - he just vomits a lot!  SWEET<br>  <br>  I think the hairball hypothesis is the most likely explaination.  Even my barfy boy calms down a bit (but not completely) if I am meticulous about brushing him and put hairball medicine (also known as tuna flavored vaseline) in his food everyday.  But no matter what, he still vomits frequently.<br>  <br>  A new onset of vomiting should be checked out by your vet, as it could have a serious cause.  But in the meantime keep a close eye on your kitty . . . is he still wanting to eat, drinking water, playing, pooping and peeing????  If he is otherwise behaving normally, it's probably not a dire situation.  Vomiting in a cat that is lethargic, not eating/drinking, and not using the box is an ominous sign.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope your kitty will be OK  :-)|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Depends on what is coming up.<br>  <br>  If there's any wads of fur in it, then it's a fur ball and you can help stop it by brushing the cat daily.<br>  <br>  If it's undigested food, the stomach is too touchy. There's a food made for cats who eat and barf, it's called Royal Canin Siamese 38, is about $11 a bag and it does help reduce the amount of barfs, we use it with one of our cats and saw a huge improvement.<br>  <br>  If you're getting clear fluid or frothy clear fluid, that's usually saliva and water just drunk from the bowl.<br>  <br>  If it's yellow, that's bile from an empty stomach, meaning the cat has nausea.  Ask the vet about giving 1/4 tablet of Pepcid (which is safe for cats, it can be given long term too without problems).  <br>  <br>  If it's a brown gunk, that's the last of digested cat food that hasn't moved into the intestines yet and was still in the stomach.  Usually that's a nausea thing as well.<br>  <br>  Tell the vet what the vomit looked like, the color tells them a LOT and they can help get this stopped.  At worse, your cat may have IBD and needs a different diet to tone it down and make the cat feel better.|`|AA10289917	The vet will probably need a specimen of what gets vomited.  If you can collect that it will save some dollars!  My cat did not have quite that problem but it cost me around $200!|`|0zriLTZXaa	Same with my cat but hes been doing it since he was 8 months old and now he is 9 years old.|`|aJDYmq4Yaa	It depends on how well you know the cat -- have owned it.  It also depends on if the cat is an indoor or outdoor/indoor pet.  If outdoor, it may be bolting hunting prey and bringing it up because of indigestion.  Outdoor/indoor cats can also bring up hairballs from grooming.  Any of my examples are natural but I would really be concerned if you see blood.<br>  Also, is the cat able to get at anything toxic in the house.  Cats can be more susceptible to some things than are we.  Having an appointment with the vet is a good thing, though.<br>  Good luck.|`|KzW6k61uaa	I Dont have that much experience in cats but it could be a reaction to food you have given to it,<br>  maybe old age Or possibly eating grass|`|qXr9XJ5Saa	My cats vomit as well.. usually it is because they overeat or they eat something that just doesn't agree with them. And sometimes, one of them just pukes up white gooey flem. Maybe try adjusting your cat's diet.<br>  Hope he gets better :)|`|ZTkHbVHOaa	Maybe it has a hairball? how old is it? Longhair, shorthair?

oBwU1zB6aa	Well usually there is no specific age dogs live to because my friend had a yorkie that lived till the age of 18, and my old dog was a border collie and live ony till the age of 4. as long as you keep the dog well exercised and fed the animal will live a long happy life. <br>  <br>      hope this helps|`|F4rCjV1haa	In there teens.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Probably around 10-15 years.|`|bIaywrBCaa	A small breed dog can live into the teen years.|`|AA11244754	a small dog like that can live, especially with a healthy diet (no people food at all) can live till 15+ years especially if you get him neutered early which greatly reduces chances of cancer
9kceDOTraa	You don't need to go that far to use lettuce actually.  They could eat it, and you can just as well rinse it off to avoid any possible pesticides.  Keep in mind, a good Spiralina 20 flake food will deliver just as well nutrients as the raw vegetables and might even be better as while your Mbuna, since I've answered your questions before, I know the Africans you are referring to are Mbuna, are primarily algae scrapers in the wild.  Spiralina comes the closest to replicating that.|`|0c5e60ce4b8fdd00c644bddf68b7f9caaa	Almost any plant material fed to fish should be "blanched",which is different from boiling. To blanch lettuce or zucchini slices,or spinach, simply heat a quart or two of water to boiling and drop the material in for 30 seconds to two minutes depending on the toughness of the plant. Remove and immediately plunge the material into icy cold water to stop the cooking process. Then present it to your pets in your usual manner. Remove the uneaten portion after 8 to 12 hours and begin the cycle again as you see fit.<br>  P.S. Another source of plant food is canned peas. They come from the can already blanched and only require removing the outer "hull" and a gentle "smashing" against the side of the tank or with Rift Lake Cichlids against the top of a smooth rock.|`|ElyP5kLMaa	I do have african cichilds.<br>  1..I do feed tham lettuces once a week...but i never boiled tham.<br>  2..I feed tham lettuces on weekend...so i put the lettuce in the tank friday night and pull it out monday morning...while still feed tham once a day..but very small among!! ( i feed my fishes 2x's a day)<br>  After about 1 year, i know how much i put in the tank and there is nothing to pull out by monday!!<br>  I hope this will give u some ideas...

They just nip it off. Just rinse in cool water.<br>  <br>  After 5 hours take out the lettuce so it dosent rot. Never let it sit over night.
AA11244754	He is probably just trying to express his anal glands, if he keeps doing it then I would take him to the vet to get them expressed but usually them scooching on the floor is good enough to do the trick.|`|UtYRJvo9aa	I would wait.  The most common causes for a dog 'scoot' as you are describing are worms/diarrhea and anal gland problems.  Anal gland impaction is highly unlikely at this young of age so I would allow for the medication to settle in and wait a few days.  If he is acting normal except for the scooting I wouldn't worry and see how things look in a few days.|`|QgeLqVSRaa	Ohh it ok!! My Maltese puppy does that ALL the time!  I was worried to and notified the vet immidietly but all's that means is that he is either itching his butt or if he does it after his poop it means that he is wiping his butt.  Its really no big deal at all!  Nothing to worry about (yet kinda groose).  To stop this just make a loud annoying sound and the puppy will freak out and stop.|`|P5CLeokmaa	i would call it wouldn't hurt.<br>  <br>  better safe then sorry.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's scratching his butt.<br>  <br>  my dogs, and cats do it all the time, on the carpet.. it drives me crazy.|`|iZml58CAaa	Most likely the other posters are correct...he may be trying to express his anal glands. However, should this behavior continue (or any other behavior you find abnormal) you should always call the vet. better to have called an know for sure, than to be mad at yourself that you didn't because something is wrong.<br>  <br>  Lastly, typical  "de-worming" medicine does not cover all types of worm, just those which are more common. Just because the vet, APL or a breeder "de-wormed" your puppy does not mean that your puppy is worm-free. The only way to be sure that your puppy does not have worms is to take a stool sample to the vet and have it tested for worms. If your vet has not looked at your puppies' stool sample and just prescribed a general de-wormer, you need to take a sample. If you collect the sample and drop it off, they won't charge you for an office visit. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doggonehairy.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.doggonehairy.net/</a>|`|bIaywrBCaa	It could be his anal glands altho he is a little young to have trouble with them. A call to the vet couldn't hurt.|`|OJE7NHHAaa	I'm not too sure.<br>  My dog does that sometimes, but usually that means he has some stuck to him, aha.<br>  But since you just got his shots and stuff maybe you should.<br>  Good luck:).
AA11988471	Get your doggie some chew toys to play with.  When he gets scared a goes for a cord tell him a firm "no" or "leave it" and hand him one of his toys.  Just be sure not to yell at him because he is most likey scared of the noises and if you just got him he is just not used to the noises yet and yelling would scare him more.  Over time he will not go for the cords anymore and go for his toys.  Hope this helps.|`|AA10347006	Get him some extra pieces of cord for chewing so he does not feel the need to chew the ones that are actually plugged in.|`|AA11542946	call the dog whisperer.....|`|AA12339164	get a small rawhide chew for it as an alternative and when the dog starts to chew a cord...firmly say NO and give it the rawhide.<br>  <br>  and pick up a bottle of 'bitter apple spray' and spray the cords and she will stop.<br>  <br>  my dog hates when i crank the stereo...loud noises make some dogs nervous and it hurts their ears...REMEMBER... their hearing is much more acute than ours. so any loud noise is amplified 100 times louder.|`|c514f56c829dae5f73a57bbb11498280aa	give her some toys and put all the cords up|`|AA12335352	Get your dog some other chew toys and you will have to teach your dog that it isn't okay to chew on anything other than his/her chew toys that are given to it.<br>  Some dogs have anxiety, I used to have a dog that would run during the 4th of July and sit in the corner of a room until it stopped . you have to teach your dog what is right and what isn't. Otherwise you will have a dog that rules your house and not you.|`|24dd62f81a99b7b11877272bdfa3f6dfaa	Nothing cuz eventually it will chew into the wrong cord and learn not to do it again.

jinAwMGNaa	Get her fixed and ask the vet for some advise.  She just may need a Cat friend, but if she keeps acting that way, she may have a mental problem.  If that's the case, she could attack and seriously hurt someone.  Remember the Chimp that went crazy and maimed that Lady for life?  It would be in everyone's best interest to put her down if the Vet can't mellow her out.|`|AA10289917	Just let her be independent.  Then she will walk by your chair.  Let your arm down to run through her hair.  Play it cool.  Too much love from you and she will keep being mean.  This takes a long time.  I have a cat who was loved by two of my men in the family.  They gave her caresses, even though she wasn't pleased at first.  (Her mother was a perfect inside and outside cat, her father a ferrel cat.)  The better I fed her the more her fur got to be a better quality and color.   She runs for cover when company comes!  Just let your cat lead you.  Eventually she will want your love.  I hope this for you.  <br>  <br>  I would not hold a cat who hisses.  Their feet can hurt you.  Just let go!  If she catches a mouse or bird she probably does it for play.  It is a cat's nature.  You have to remember this.|`|F15JJA4vaa	Well, my cat, Gizmo, was just like that. Try to see what she likes (such as: yarn, a ball,etc.), then try to get her to play with you. Remember, you can't force this. Start with it just being you, then others can (gradually) play too. Reward her with treats if she follows through. good luck!!!|`|0zriLTZXaa	She probably turned into a mean cat because she is older. Older cats like time to relax alone with nobody bothering them. The same thing happened with my cat. Kittens are all so playful and sweet but when they get older they change. Maybe give her cat treats.|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	Some cats don't like to be held.  When you follow them around, they may think you are chasing them.  My cats don't want me to hold them or pet them much but they like to snuggle against me when I sleep.  She may just be getting more territorial with age.  So give her more space.  She might be in pain and maybe she hurts when she is picked up.  So maybe ask the vet if she is sick.  Also, I have heard that some people give cats anti-depressants for cats.  You could ask the vet about that.  It sounds weird, but your cat may be getting too much petting.  They have a touch threshold and after too much touching, they feel pain.  So give her attention in other ways like throw toys for her and hand feed her treats.  Show her the front of your hand so she won't worry that you are just going to grab her.  When you stare at your cat, make sure you slowly blink at her.  That is cat language for showing affection.  Long stares are interpreted as threats in cat language.  Don't have strangers hold her or chase after her.  She is getting older and more territorial and spooks more easily.  You may have to tell them don't touch her but just have them give her treats and pet her only when she is being nice and comes up to them.
tPGxPDvBaa	Try the westie rescue or ask the westie breed club for referrals or attend local dog shows.  Just remember you get what you pay for & paying a cheaper price pup from a crappy breeder doesn't help you or the dog & you will be paying vet bills & not have a quality looking dog either.  They have a long history of allergy & skin issues so be sure to completely research any breeder's pups for skin problems before buying.<br>  <br>  I love westies - they are one of my fave breeds & I specialized in grooming them since I had one.  Good luck in your search.|`|pd5rERcfaa	Try www.petfinder.com.  Up to 40% of dogs in shelter are purebreds, and millions of dogs die every year because they don't have homes.

0m6BgESXaa	I've said it once, I'll say it again.  This work is not just for any average owner.  This is for someone who really wants to get involved with dogs, because doing it RIGHT is extremely expensive and time consuming.<br>  <br>  If you want to participate in a good sport, find a schutzhund club local to you (and local could be as long as six hours away).  If you want a "guard dog" just to act tough, don't even bother, because what you'll end up with is a liability, and in the end, most likely a dead dog.<br>  <br>  Is your puppy to old for it?  No.  Is he suitable for it?  The only way to know is to take him to a schutzhund club and have him evaluated.<br>  <br>  What breed of dog is it?|`|pIvN6TY7aa	What kind of dog? There are so many different kinds of dogs, with many different kinds of attitudes bred into them.<br>  <br>  A lot of your question, too, rests on what you mean by guarding training. <br>  <br>  My first dog was an Akita. We got her to guard our house against bears. We got her to do it because she was of a breed developed to hunt bears and other large game.  That was her job, and by the time she was 12 months, she was going her regular route, and sending bears elsewhere. She came in the house occasionally, and behaved like a quiet cat. Only when she grew elderly did she stop guarding. Then came some bear issues, but that's another story.<br>  <br>  The "foster dog" I have now is so different in many ways.  She's some sort of Corgy/Pomeranian mix. Short legs, fat, with a flamboyant plume of a tail, and a vocal range I can scarcely believe. I know somone's coming before they've even come into the yard. And she seems to sense who is a threat and who isn't.  For example, she has a whole vocabulary for when my ex comes around. She barks hard and sharp and fast. Even some yowly-growly noises. He used to come in quietly, which made me uneasy.  He doesn't any more. There's someone else now, whose intentions seem to be more honourable. From the first time they met, she yipped and danced some, but treated him like a friend, not a stranger.  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, some dogs, the retrievers, for example, are everybody's friend. I could imagine them defending a member of his 'pack" (family), but only under real pressure.<br>  <br>  As I understand it, the police say that a small, yappy dog can provide better home security than a bigger, quieter one. (Of course, I've heard some pretty good stories about some big dogs too ....) <br>  <br>  If you're talking about 'attack' training, I don't know and I don't want to know.  In my opinion, that kind of dog has no decent place anywhere on earth, and I make a point of avoiding a person who is interested in that kind of dog. Of those people that I have known, each ended doing something really nasty, and stupid, and dangerous. (On the other hand, I do find the concept of one or two dozen attack-trained Chihuahuas interesting ....)
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	No, I think he's being a puppy and you're anthropomorphizing him.  By the way, you're just making it much, much harder on him to ever be housetrained by paper training him.  All that's doing is confusing him because you're teaching him it's ok to pee in the house.  Why not buy a good book on raising a puppy and you'll learn how to housetrain him correctly right from the get go.|`|igI5yX0vaa	No, just make sure he gets enough activity.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Could easily be normal fear and maturing the puppy is going through. However, I would suggest starting a puppy class soon as your puppy has had its initial vaccinations. Your puppy needs to start socialization and training, especially with a dog that will be big like a Gordon Setter. <br>  <br>  A puppy should not be loose in the house at this point for this reason and others. The puppy should be either tied to you on a leash, in a crate or on a supervised tiedown so the puppy doesn't learn bad habit and do things without you being there to supervise them.|`|oHKpy4IRaa	He is acting like this because Gordon setters need exercise and with you paper training him he is not getting  enough activity at all. It is not fair for him. Why did you get a dog that was going to need exercise and not want to exercise him? Try taking him for a nice long walk every day and he will not do this. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|AA12361886	Sounds bi polar to me.  just like other bipolar people they are nice one day and turn into mean people the next. but I think they still go potty in the bathroom like their supposed to.|`|d5GfhPM4aa	well he might just have some problems but because of humans breeding dogs they turn out to have some mental problems like ocd and stuff|`|0UqOwLCjaa	Make an experiment: take a kitchen knife and put it at his reach.

Keep in mind, he just had a major life change - new home, new family, where the heck is my mom?  He's probably stressed.  I found that scolding a dog when they go inside doesn't work - they get that what they did was bad, but they don't always connect that the part that was bad was where they did the deed.  Many dogs will start to hide it, going in corners or behind furniture, because they get the idea that doing the deed is what's shameful.  Just calmly place him on the pad when you catch him in the act, and then give praise.  If you don't catch him in the act, it's too late for discipline anyway.  Dogs have about a 3-second memory for cause-effect.  If you come in when he's laying down and start scolding about the mess on the floor, he'll think that laying down is what got him in trouble.<br>  <br>  Take him on long walks each day (around the house until he's ready to go out, just get him on the leash to start training him).  After the walks, start teaching him to sit, stay, etc.  He may not get these yet, but the mental challenge of figuring out how to get the treat will burn the mental energy that the walk didn't cover.  After the walks and the training, take some time to play, love, and just give affection.  Excercise, discipline, affection, in that order.  This will help him get settled in his new environment.<br>  <br>  The fact that he has good days means he knows what's right.  The bad days just means, like a teenager, he's acting out because of his stress.  He'll come around.  Just maintain your own attitude of calm assertiveness and he will learn to respect and trust you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

The proper term if this cat was shown is "Black Tortoiseshell" or "Black Tortie".  Tortie has lots of variations - <a href="http://www.seregiontica.org/Colors/tortietorbie/tortietorbie.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seregiontica.org/Colors/torti...</a><br>  <br>  Please get all of these kittens spayed and neutered before you give them away.  If you don't want to endure that expense then surrender them to a no-kill shelter so they can spay and neuter them and find new homes for them.  They can be spayed and neutered as early as eight weeks as long as they're healthy and weight at least two pounds.  Don't wait till six months like some behind-the-times vets still recommend as kittens can reach sexual maturity as early as FOUR months!|`|oT71QN8Raa	Its very possible.  I have two tortie girls, and they had a black brother and a blue/gray sister :)  As she gets older, you will see more orange coloring appear.  My girls are 9 months and still, everyday, I see more colors come out in their fur.  Have fun with her :) because for reasons unknown to me, torties are known for their unique personalities.  You will notice her getting into more trouble than the siblings :)  They are GREAT babies.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Its calico that carries the whites and softer colors. Torties carry the black and darker colors :)|`|ZTkHbVHOaa	if she has the markings as you say, then I would think more "calico" than a "tortoiseshell" which carries the "softer colors" not black.  Calico cats  are black/orange/white see the link for confirmation and answer to the female question.|`|zP0U1lp9aa	Sounds like a tortoiseshell, they are very common among mixed breed cats, and yes, 99.9% sure she is a female if she is a tortoiseshell.  It's great you took in mom and now babies, if your a dog person, you will be pleasantly surprised at what cats will offer you.  With your dogs around don't be surprised if you end up with at least one feline version of a very big dog!  Good luck to you and your little ones.
pd5rERcfaa	This sounds like you'll have a happy pup, just make sure the walks are mentally engaging as well as physically-your lab sees you as the leader, stays at your side or behind you, and focuses on the walk and nothing else.

It really all depends on how your dog takes it and how much exercise specifically that dog needs. But I would definitely start there, the biggest problem most people have with exercising their dog is keeping routine. There is always going to be a "I don't feel like it" excuse...but the dogs don't care about excuses..so just make sure to keep at it! You are on the right track

I am so sorry.  What a terrible loss for you, my heart goes out to you.  When you're ready, try this book, "My Personal Pet Remembrance Journal" by Enid Traisman.  Its a really helpful resource for you to deal with not being able to say goodbye to you sweet kitty and for celebrating her life.  I can't imagine what you're feeling right now, but this really helped me when I lost my dog in a horrible way.  I talked with a pet psychic-I know that might sound silly, but it really helped me.  She said that animals are able to leave their bodies when they sense an accident, and they don't actually experience the physical pain of a trauma.  Take time to grieve, honor your feelings, don't let anyone tell you its only a cat-you had a special relationship with her.  Hoping life becomes gentle again soon, my thoughts are with you.|`|zP0U1lp9aa	I am so sorry to hear about your cat.  If I was you, I'd be out looking for her, she couldn't have gone far from your neighbors if she had broken bones, and there is always the chance that she is still alive. Cats are able to crawl into very tiny spaces, especially in fear, so look everywhere.  Call for her, she may just answer.  Have your neighbor make sure their dog is put away and search the area.  I had a 20 year old cat so 14 is not really that old.  Good luck.  Take it day by day and know that you loved her and gave her a good life.<br>  <br>  I really am sorry for your loss.|`|pa6N30V3aa	Well it was 14 years old.. most cats die around that time of old age. Get a brand new little kitty.|`|5giBIg2xaa	Our young kitten was everything to me. I loved her more than anything and when she was exactly a year old and we had her 10 months to the day we got home to find she had been run over. I cried for weeks and even know, 5 months later I still have trouble looking at her photo.<br>  <br>  You will cope and move on. It certainly doesn't feel that way now, I know exactly how you feel. You feel like nothing will make you happy and that you will never stop thinking about your kitty but trust me, you will feel better. It will probably take a few weeks or so but you will eventually be able to move on :) We just got 2 new kittens over the last 2 weeks and I originally felt guilty and that I wouldn't be able to give them the love they deserved but they are so beautiful and so little it's impossible not to love them :)<br>  <br>  Take care, you will feel better one day.
FdcWPp48aa	Reputable breeders do not advertise puppies in ads!|`|JsBb732Maa	Ask about the health care the puppy has received,how many dogs the breeder raises, stay away from any one that raises more than two breeds, that's a puppy mill for sure. Ask if the breeder has done any showing, obedience or any thing like that.Any references, other puppies sold and ask if you can talk to the new owners, who the vet is so you can get references from them. I have put puppies in the paper, that doesn't automatically mean your a bad breeder, it's just another way to get the word out. I talk to the perspective owners, ask a lot of questions myself about them and their experience with dogs.|`|2lNM2xBmaa	Ask them if they have the mother and father? Do they have pictures of either? More than likely they have the mother and you can meet the mother. They should allow you to meet the mom so you can see her temperament. Ask to see photos of the father. If they don't know who the father is, ask why not. <br>  <br>  Ask if the mother has had her vaccinations prior to the birth of the pups to make sure an immunity was past to the pups in the milk.<br>  <br>  Ask what vet attention the pups have had. Have they had vaccinations or worming? <br>  <br>  If it is a purebred, ask about possible genetic diseases and ask if the mom or dad had any kind of certifications to check the hips and elbows and eyes.|`|YKcNS64faa	don't buy the puppy, a Good breeder wouldn't  to advertise their puppies, its a puppy mill thats advertising. either buy a shelter dog or purchase from a responsible breeder.|`|XavY3fiWaa	You need to put more information in your question, i don't know what you mean.|`|EcgO4dlnaa	is it for like a shelter?<br>  <br>  need more information

Don't do that!  try a fence around your yard before resorting to possibly harming the poor cat.

Lately we have been firing up the pressure washer to deal with interlopers. We don't spray them directly but they get the message.<br>   We have feral cats that we value as pest controllers. We just don't want them in our gardens.|`|NSKimt1Qaa	It could be considered animal cruelty if it actually injured one.  Don't get me wrong - I love super soakers!  My kids had them when they were younger and we had a lot of fun; however the water pressure on some of those could be too much for little kids.  I think you could injure a cat with those if you were trying to, but if you exercise caution and just using it to scare them away, you should be alright.  I wouldn't be trying to knock them over, though.  There, you are talking possible animal cruelty.

It's the same with any animal. You can blame it on the owner/ trainer.  Yes Arabs are hot but I have a couple of friends with wonderful arabs.  <br>  They just have a lot of energy and need, NEED! to be worked.  Some disiplines like their horses to behave hot because it looks fancy in the show ring. <br>  So your comment is kind of like saying all Pitbull dogs should be put down because they all are dangerous to humans.  Animals are what we make them and I work with an awesome Arab jumper and my dog is an awesome pitbull that my kids can hang all over.<br>  Blame the trainer or owner not the horse.|`|AA11145908	That's just sick.

No horse should be slaughtered! I know a very gentle arab horse!|`|AA11634022	Arabs are not crazy. I have 4 part arab horses and one purebred arab. Let me tell you, they are NOT CRAZY. At the breed shows, and all those people believing that arab breed shows are 'all there is', they deliberately SCARE them, to make their eyes pop, their tails fly and to see them plunging and frightened. My arabs are trained to be riding horses, they are mature, bombproof and quiet. Once when they all had to go on a truck together the transporter remarked what quiet horses they were. The rap of 'crazy arab' is not due to the breed, which is loyal and loving and spirited and rewarding, but to the idiot trainers and owners who love to see their horses terrified. The arab will always be, the 'versatile horse' and remember, the arab was the first breed of horse, without them, we would all be riding prezewalskis horse!|`|7a94b08633713812fb94f864517c2134aa	Why are you writing such horibble things about arabs?   No one that loves horses would say those things.  What???  Barbed wire???  How excactly would you react to being hit over the head with a plank of wood, or having barbed wire put in your mouth?<br>  <br>  If you have been hurt by an arab before, I suggest you get counselling, and stay away from animals until then.<br>  <br>  I agree, arabs require someone with experience and horse knowledge, but every horse requires someone that is sane and not abusive, and a brain is definately a pre-requisite.<br>  <br>  I hope you find the help you need.  you are being in a sense racist ( I would say "breedist", but there's no such word), by descriminating against a whole breed of horses like that.

But, some horse feeds are coming up with additives like glucosomine and chronditrin (spelling?) in their feeds. Also, if its getting really bad, you're vet may be able to give you bute for it. My horse has finally gotten to that point and receives a gram in the morning and a gram at night. I wouldn't do more than that especially at the beginning as there are other effects related to long term bute  use. Also, I have found that just massaging the arthritic area on my horse seems to help him a bit.

Pp5juixDaa	It's the water that you put in it. It probably isn't filtered which will give the water a couldy look. To get rid of it, I suggest changing the water and adding some ZooMed's ReptiClear to the water. It helps with the clorine and cloramites, prevents and removes ammonia build up, adds electrolites, rehydrates new arrivals (which would be good for yours if you just got them, they tend to go into a depression like phase when moved around), reduces pH, and helps control slime build up. All I had to do to clear up my water was dump the old stuff and fill my tank up with water from a filtered faucet. There's always the option of buying a gallon of filtered water for $1.50 at the store (WalMart, Kmart, Target, Dollar Store, etc).<br>  And, turtles really are more messy than fish. You'll need more than just a fish tank filter for turtles.|`|7hPD6Ax4aa	The cloudiness is normal for a new tank while the good bacteria that is required for a healthy tank is starting to multiply. The beginning of bacteria colonizations results in couldy water. Give it a week or two, and the water should clear up. And yes, turtles are more messy than fish--way more.  Water needs to be changed about once a week, especially with two turtles.  You can help keep the mess out of the tank by feeding them in a separate container, since turtles eliminate bowels just before or after eating. Also, scoop up the solid mess when you see it.|`|9ea9417c9a589009a2d7aea37032b385aa	I have found that what and how much you feed them attributes a lot to the cleanliness of their tank.|`|ezNSyvqeaa	This is normal for all new tanks.  However, Turtle tanks tend to be cloudier due to all the waste products they excrete.  I have 2 baby painted turtles and a baby map turtle that I keep in a 100 Liter plastic Sterilite container.  I have an "island" of large landscaping rocks for them, but other than that I have no rocks of substrate in the bottom.  This allows the filter to pull out the sediment better because it cant get stuck in the rocks at the bottom.  <br>  <br>  A sidenote - make sure you add the turtle tank neutralizer to your tank.  It is available at pet stores as well as Walmart and Meijer.  It only costs a couple dollars, and the calcium that it adds to your tank is well worth it!  I have owned baby turtles off and on for over 10 years and have never had a problem with shell softness as long as I have been using this product.|`|aa58204081d65b04756d956271060c4baa	i have s red ear slider as well. Do u clean his/her aqauarium. Cause when u wash it with cold water ot too hot water it turnds cloudy so i ussually wipe it with a towel.

AA11171398	try jumping oxers and make sure your prepared for them. also, try and test yourself on speed. in CC you'll need to make some sharp turns and fast descissions. i would work on speed with show jumping and then make the jumps a bit bigger. also, try to be a bit more accurate with judging your stride. and you could try taking your horse out into the woods to expose him/her to different surroundings. hills, bright flowers, ponds and water are all in CC.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Get out in those woods!

If you do have access to trails, this is a great place to expose your horse to the type of setting he will find in a cross country course. Many of us live in environments that are far removed from trail access points, in that case, here's a few exercises I learned while auditing a clinic by Olympian Darren Chiacha.<br>  <br>  The first thing you want to do is work on establishing your pace, which is done on the flat. You want to work on pushing your horse forward into his gallop, then collecting him back a bit. You're going to need this adjustability on a cross country course, where much of the terrain is covered at a gallop, broken only by a few collected strides to take a jump. <br>  <br>  When you get ready to start schooling, it doesn't have to be anything major. Create a single vertical with ground poles as guiders on both sides so you can jump it going each direction. Practice going over it in a straight line in both directions. Then start figure-eighting it and coming at it at different angles. This will help you when you find yourself presented with slanted or oddly positioned jumps. In cross country especially, you'll often find yourself forced to jump at an angle rather than perfectly straight-on as in hunters. <br>  <br>  It helps, too, if you have low standards or can jump the jump when its raised up to the higher holes. Then you can start practicing jumping the fence toward each end, rather than perfectly in the middle. This is helpful practice for when you're forced to jump a corner, which is narrow at one end and very wide at another. You need to know your horse will respond and jump the fence where you tell him to, and not run out to the side just because he's near the edge. Low standards also are reminiscent of many cross country obstacles, which don't have standards and are basically the same size all the way around. <br>  <br>  When you're comfortable jumping the single fence at different angles and positions, you can add a filler tray placed flat on the ground one stride out from the fence. This tray imitates a ditch. When you first go over it, it helps to lay out ground poles  as a sort of chute, guiding the horse to the "ditch" and preventing him from running out. Be prepared for a dramatic jump, as most horses start out a bit shy over these planks. Once you go over it a few times, your horse should take it in stride. Then you can remove the ground poles that act as your chute, and canter the line going both directions. <br>  <br>  You can also start practicing small corner jumps. You can use three standards or two standards and a milk jug. The rails should come together to form a corner (hence the name of the fence). Practice going over it and aim for the narrowest section. Keep it nice and low right now, and make sure your outside leg is strong, as your horse will naturally be inclined to run out at this type of obstacle. Jump the corner going both direction, and gradually raise up the height to what you're normally jumping. When you're comfortable going over the edge of the corner, change things up. Make sure you're using a milk jug or other low object for where the two rails meet, as you're going to want to take your horse right up the center of the corner (think of it now like an arrow). Jump the fence where the two rails meet. Again, you'll need a strong leg to keep your horse straight, as many of them will try to drift out to the side.<br>  <br>  There will be things you can only practice on the course (jumping into water, real ditches, stairs, etc.), but following some of these exercises will help prepare you for other obstacles you'll commonly see in cross country courses. You may also be interested in the great book Training the Cross Country Horse by Andrew Nicholson, which has more exercises and some that are similar to what I've described.

After a few times of using the round pen to help teach him what I wanted him to do, I could lunge him on a lunge line without a problem. The hardest part for me was trying to get him to move away from me instead of move with me or towards me.

58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I'm very sorry to read about the loss of your home bred horse.<br>  For owners and veterinarians, it is extremely frustrating when a horse dies suddenly and no explanation can be found. While intoxications as a cause of unexpected death are relatively uncommon, it is important to be aware of them, as they are potentially preventable. In a recent study of 200 cases of sudden and unexplained death in horses and ponies older than one year, no cause of death was found in roughly one third of the cases. The remaining died from cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or respiratory lesions.<br>  <br>  For accurate diagnosis of heart disease, the vet examining the horse must appreciate unique aspects of equine cardiovascular physiology in order to distinguish normal variation from a pathophysiologic state. Cardiovascular problems in the horse include auscultation of cardiac murmurs, identification of cardiac arrhythmias, and recognition of congestive heart failure. A cardiac data base including history, general and cardiovascular examination, and resting and postexercise electrocardiogram are necessary to evaluate most horses for significant heart disease. Additional studies, such as echocardiography and cardiac catheterization, are useful in selected cases. Because some types of heart disease are amendable by therapy, an accurate diagnosis is needed to direct treatment and offer a realistic prognosis.<br>  <br>  In general, most horses that collapse and die suddenly are the victims of an aortic aneurysm, which is a weakening in the wall of the aorta--the major vessel leading from the heart. This area of weakened wall can rupture and the horse then bleeds out internally. In other words, there are no external signs of bleeding, except that the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, eyes, rectum, and genitalia become very pale. People can develop a similar weakening of the wall of major vessels, and surgical intervention to strengthen the area is usually indicated if the aneurysm is diagnosed prior to its rupture. So far, vets have been unsuccessful in developing successful ways to either diagnose or treat these aneurysms in the horse.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, horses can develop a rhythm abnormality in the heart beat, most often atrial fibrillation, which is an irregular contraction of the collecting chambers of the heart. Under circumstances of great stress, this rhythm abnormality can lead to collapse and possible death, although more often it results in exercise intolerance.<br>  <br>  Without a full autopsy, it is unlikely that you will ever know the reason for the loss of your horse.|`|46462111857a3dc8ba4a565c74c14907aa	it is possible for a horse to have a heart murmur and not be detected. and then die from a stroke.  i  saw a horse fall over dead at a show from a stroke. they later found out the horse had a heart murmur. the horse was 7 years old and very healthy and in very good shape. i very sorry for ur loss. i hope this helps u.<br>  <br>  also- i dont know if it is the same in horses as in humanes but when i got put in the hospital(from a stroke) when i was 18 they found i had a heart murmur... the family doc never detected it before  and said that it was common to not be able to detect until something happened. i was healthy as they come to until that day.|`|aecd4219c4a658bd808fe5f7f54efa76aa	I Have Heard Of This Happening.

A women was lunging her four year old gelding and he just dropped dead out of the blue.  Fortunately she wasn't riding but she was shocked and heartbroken.  There's really not much to do.  Even regular check-ups may not catch a murmur it may only be an issue when the horse is excited or working and never cause a problem or be devestating when least expected.  I'm very sorry you lost your filly.  Try to remember that her short years with you were healthy and happy.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	I haven't had any experience with a heart murmur, but I know a POA mare that died of a heart attack.

One morning, the owner saw her laying down out in the pasture, went out there to check on her, and she had passed away.  It was very very unexpected.

I cannot answer for wolves that have been associated with dogs as I'm talking about the wilds.|`|a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	Wolves CAN bark like dogs but usually they do not... generations of selective breeding by humans has favored dogs that bark more than howl. In the wild wolves rarely bark, but usually howl, dogs usually bark but rarely howl. <br>  <br>  Excerpt from Wikipedia.... Although dogs are a subspecies of the wolf, Canis lupus, their barking constitutes a significant difference from their parent species. Although wolves do bark (or more accurately, howl or bay), they do so only in specific situations. According to Coppinger and Feinstein, dogs bark in long, rhythmic stanzas but adult wolf barks tend to be brief and isolated.[1] Dogs, by contrast, bark frequently and in many different situations.<br>  <br>  It has been suggested that the reason for the difference lies in the dog's domestication by humans. Dogs present a striking example of neoteny, the retention of juvenile characteristics in the adults. They are similar to young wolves in many of their mannerisms and physical features, such as large heads, flat faces, large eyes, submissiveness and vocalizing – all of which are exhibited in wolf puppies.<br>  <br>  Some believe that these characteristics were deliberately selected for soon after domestication. There may have been a number of reasons for this. For instance, an overgrown puppy would very likely have been seen as a more engaging companion than a more mature but less amusing pet, as well as being less aggressive. More prosaically, an increased tendency to bark could have been useful to humans to provide an early warning system. Dogs may have been used to alert their owners that another unfamiliar band of humans or a predatory animal was in the area.<br>  <br>  Individual dogs bark for a variety of reasons. They may bark to attract attention, to communicate a message, or to express excitement. Dog barks do not constitute an information-rich message in the same fashion as human speech, but they do nonetheless constitute more than mere noise. Statistical analysis has revealed that barks can be divided into different subtypes based on context and that individual dogs can be identified by their barks. Disturbance barks tend to be harsh, low frequency, and unmodulated, whereas isolation and play barks tend to be tonal, higher frequency, and modulated. Barks are often accompanied by body movements as part of a broader package of dog communication.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_%28dog%29#Why_dogs_bark" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bark_%28dog...</a>|`|0eeXTQp1aa	they bark just like any other dog|`|2bf23838a95610cfed45cc1253e50cdaaa	you know i'd think they'd bark but I guess the only thing they do is howl and growl|`|BdBcDHupaa	they are fairly similar, as they're related, but wolves have the unique ability to howl on two tones at once. that is why if you howl they will not respond, but if two people howl then there is a good chance you'll get a response. i'm not sure about the bark, but i hope my 'funfact' helped.|`|ZJma8GD8aa	Yes. Wolves can bark like dogs. I knew someone who used to have wolves (until he died unexpectedly a couple of years ago) and when someone would pull into the, driveway whose vehicle they did not know, they would bark just like any other dog. But at a certain time every night they would also howl. But some regular dogs do that too, especially if they are near a railroad and they hear a train in the distance or hear a siren.|`|c6d54edbb6f22bcedb481889c10168d9aa	AAAAOOOOOOOOOOWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  That answer the question?|`|g7lUHPLWaa	Very similar, since they are wild dogs.

AA11596013	I have had horse's all my life and love them dearly. My personal perfance is a rope halter and depending on what you are doing at least a 20ft lunge rope.  There are special halters out there at are becoming very popular that release the pressure when your horse is not pulling on the lunge rope. So this helps the horse to learn not to fight the halter and it builds and better relationship between you and your horse. I have seen a special halter on Monty Roberts web site.  I love the way he works with horse's and the web site would have more information on your question.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	All depends on what you're are trying to accomplish.  Just a good warm-up, a well made rope halter with a well made lunge line without a snap would work great.  If you are focusing on positioning and shaping your horse there are some great cavesons and surcingles on the market.  Also depends on your specific discipline and your own training style.  I'm a reining person so I stick with the rope halter and 2 long lines just ran through my stirrups.  You can achieve such a nice shape all the way through the hip, ribcage, forequarters, and head/neck.  Use whatever you and your horse are comfortable with.|`|AA11139360	I use a knotted rope halter with a yaht-grade rope lead and a stock stick.  I feel like you get better control and can move a lot easier with it, and I've found my horses respond a lot better and seem to like it too.|`|Mnepz2Vpaa	Personally I like rope halters because then if the horse spooks or decides to be defiant, he can't just run away dragging you because he can't pull against a rope halter (as much as a regular halter).<br>  I also use the round lounge line because I just don't like the feel of the thin ribbon ones!  <br>  I'm not really into serious official "lunging," I just do the Parelli circle game and let people think that I'm lunging.  I'm into more of the natural approach, plus the circle game leaves more of the responsibility on the horse to maintain the desired gait as opposed to you  spinning around watching him and clucking at him. <br>  It really is person preference though, and depends on what kind of lunging you like to do.|`|b2a5fd6852471574043fc3ea0b28a596aa	Depends on the purpose.  If I'm working a connection (advance retreat or join up, whatever you prefer to call it) I only want them in a halter with no line, and I have a rope for encouragement.  If I'm working them for training reasons, like with young foals, I prefer a rope halter and about a 10-12 foot cotton lead line.  If it's for muscle and frame building, I usually use a bridle, bit, sursingle, sidelines, and a 20 foot lunge line with a lunge whip.  And if I'm just trying to "get the bucks out" before you ride a young horse, either a halter and lead line or just tacked up with the reins tied.  Lunging has so many purposes, all great for the horse and trainer, but each calls for something a little different

Little kids scare little dogs because they are so hyper and the dogs are just plain scared. Being scared makes him angry, he is just defending himself.

You should not harm the dog but I had a similar problem with my dog. As soon as he starts to do something you don't want him to, either spray him on the nose with a small squirt gun or hit him on the nose with a rolled up newspaper. Neither will harm the dog but just shock them so they know if they do it again it will do it again.|`|45438e7a1eca04a62b7d2d2336c600fdaa	I agree with Leo, and remember- dogs can tell by their "gut-feeling"/ instinct  whenever there is a bad person/s around- that  is how they sense if one is afraid of them or not- also why he will bite you if you are afraid of them.<br>  <br>  Maybe there is 1 or 2 kids from the bundle of kids who he do not trust at all (who are not what they seem to be). <br>  <br>  I have a pit bull, and for some reason- some kids or adults can visit me but some can't come in.

Kids can do these things without you knowing. And the dog cant tell you in words. I'm not trying to offend you in any way. But kids will be kids. And you are doing the right thing getting him use to the kids. Your little dog has some issues with kids. Just watch him and try to figure it out. Good Luck.

aae2bd84bb3a0bc9a3e58b418ab4d481aa	Yes they are considered a cichlid..... and no that does not mean they can only go with other cichlids.  Cichlids vary in aggressiveness and also the water parameters they would prefer.  Angels are on the semi-aggressive side.  But they are not very fast and generally won't have much luck killing other fish in a large tank with lots of plants and ornaments.  Many cichlids can not go together at all.  An angel wouldn't last long with a wolf cichlid for instance.  When people say cichlids should be with other cichlids they are usually referring to African cichlids which originate from 3 rift lakes in Africa.  Unlike other cichlids they prefer different water conditions such as a higher PH and salt.|`|AA12033321	Angelfish are cichlids, but they can do well with other fish until they get large. Then they may decide that a smaller fish looks pretty tasty. Also if you have more than one & the conditions are right, they may start to breed. That is when they become VERY aggressive. I had a breeding pair that would attack me when I did regular tank maintenance . They would slam into  my hand & try to bite. One time the male stuck a barb from his top fin into my finger. Felt like a pin prick & it did make me bleed, but didn't hurt too bad. They also almost killed another male of the same size that was in the tank with them.|`|6f0d0901d4cf8e51f51ec521e6f8a6a7aa	As the first answerer said, angels are cichlids but they are usually fine in a community tank. I have had 4 angels in a 75 gallon tank with tetras and siamese algae eaters for 2 years now and they do great.

91bc5a4554ac2e1e527a120784cfc705aa	Wow, this is a new twist on an old urban legend!  The usual way the story is told is that male squirrels will castrate each other while fighting.  Either way, squirrels do not castrate each other.   I've worked as a wildlife rehabilitator for many years, and I have raised dozens if not hundreds of litters of baby squirrels.  I have never seen a baby male squirrel castrated by its mother.  I think where this story may come from is that when they are very young, baby squirrels need to be stimulated to urinate.  (I assume this helps keep them from going just anywhere all over their nest, mucking it up.) Squirrel mothers stimulate their babies to urinate by licking them just above their genitalia, where their bladders are.  Maybe someone saw this once, misinterpreted it, and started spreading this story.  But I assure you, it isn't true!|`|AA11736908	Maybe in captivity they don't do it but maybe out in nature they do....what ever the reason, it's weird.

nIgHAnjkaa	Allergic dermatitis is a general term to describe a group of skin allergies that may be caused by a multitude of factors in cats.<br>  <br>  Allergies are immune reactions to a given substance (allergen), which the body recognizes as foreign. These reactions occur following initial exposure to the allergen, with subsequent development of a hypersensitivity that causes itching and inflammation upon future exposures.<br>  <br>  The most common classes of allergic dermatitis seen in cats are:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Flea bite allergy <br>  <br>  Food allergy<br>  <br>  Atopy – an allergic condition caused by inhaled allergens, or absorption of allergens through the skin<br>  <br>  Less common are:<br>  <br>  <br>  Drug reactions<br>  <br>  Hormonal allergies <br>  <br>  Bacterial allergies<br>  <br>  Allergies to other parasites (mites, intestinal worms, ticks)<br>  <br>  Contact allergies (due to topical treatments or exposure to fibers, floor polish and detergents)<br>  <br>  Atopy and flea bite allergy are usually seen in young adults, whereas food allergy can be seen at any age. Some animals may be prone to development of certain allergies due to genetic factors. Allergic signs may be seasonal, depending on the cause of the allergy.<br>  <br>  What to Watch for <br>  <br>  <br>  Scratching, licking, chewing or biting the skin, feet and ears.<br>  <br>  Red, raised, scaly areas on the skin<br>  <br>  Bumps, crusts or pus filled vesicles on the skin<br>  <br>  Increased skin pigmentation<br>  <br>  Thickened skin<br>  <br>  Loss of hair<br>  <br>  Salivary staining (brown color)<br>  <br>  Head shaking<br>  <br>  Diagnosis<br>  <br>  The specific diagnostic protocol may vary depending on what type of allergy or other skin disease is suspected.

Careful adherence to your veterinarian's recommendations regarding oral medications and bathing is very important. Some animals may require bathing several times per week. Additionally, medications are often required even after the clinical signs have resolved.<br>  <br>  Preventative care<br>  <br>  Although allergic dermatitis cannot be prevented, limiting exposure to allergens will help alleviate some of the clinical signs. Flea control in the environment is imperative for animals diagnosed with flea allergy dermatitis. Treating the pet alone is not sufficient to control the problem.<br>  <br>  Environmental reduction of any known allergens is advised. This may require keeping pets inside when pollen counts are high, avoiding long grass or freshly cut grass, and limiting dust and mold in the household. Eliminating exposure to certain foods is crucial to effective treatment of food allergy dermatitis.|`|63SnJb5Iaa	Well, if you have her wearing a collar, she may just be itchy from it.

AA11824468	Does your pig have access to go outdoors to root in the dirt and also get nourishment from natural vegetation?  Pigs are susceptible to selenium deficiency but in most areas if they are allowed to graze and root in the soil they will get enough unless, the soil is selenium deficient.  All prepackaged miniature pig feed comes with a certain amount of selenium added to the feed.  Just so you know, too much selenium can also be dangerous.  But the ability for the pig to root in natural soil is not harmful.  <br>  <br>  Diets high in fiber are best and if you can offer a combination of natural grains such as;  oats, cracked corn, alfalfa/hay, beet bulb and wheat mixed in equal amounts and given twice daily, your pig would be on a decent diet.  Don't overfeed your pig.  2/3 of a cup in the morning and that same amount in the evening would be ample.

Always make certain that your pig has a lot of fresh water to drink.  <br>  <br>  Avoid any foods that are fattening or filled with natural sugar.

Farm and Fleet has a great powder that you sprinkle onto horses, cattle, or poultry.  It's very inexpensive as well.  It's easy to use and shouldn't damper their egg production.  Lice are usually not associated with any type of fowl disease.  To be safe you could vaccinate for Marek's Disease and Coccidiosis, but I think you should be fine.  If you have the time, bathing the chickens before dusting them would help, but is not needed.|`|AA10447601	Its common for all birds to get lice .If you want something cheap easy to find and works good .Buy some seven garden dust to dust them with .Clean the nest boxes out and spray the boxes and their cage with a liquid insecticide (farm and garden )while they are not in it .Put clean material in the boxes after the spray is dry <br>   and you should not have any more problems .You might repeat this process in a week or 2 if you think they may still have some
200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	In the breeding stables I help do some mare watching (mares who are in readiness for foaling with 24/7 watch).   The woman stated that her stud was abit "lost" the first few times he breed.  <br>  <br>  Due to insurance and the high market price of her stud, she does not do pasture breeding anymore.  Prior to that decision, she did do pasture breeding but first had to have him breed in a comfortable, but human handled managed environment. He is very dominate and likes his pen. She would breed him outside his pen, and only her would handle him as he doesn't perform or have interest if someone else is handling him. Studs do get very dominat about their environment and their owners.  After a few breeds, she was able to allow him to figure it out in pasture, which didn't take long. <br>  <br>  Also, have the vet check him out and collect semen.  See how high or low his testrom is and if his diet is affecting his hormons/ sexual interest.<br>  <br>  some mares and studs are picky. My mare does not like paints and to this day, the paint stud is paid for, 10 years later. She is a quarter sorrel and she would not take to the paint (ex owner stated).  but when I breed her to a quarter chestnut (Doc Bar and poco blood line), she was all for it through out the 3 interval days we bred her. If a paint comes near, she won't no matter how in season she is. Horses can be funny sometimes on that stuff.|`|549c4586f1db55e236038239ce134269aa	You could try running them both together in a small coral and keep an eye on them, from a distance.<br>  <br>  If you would like an Equestrian/Riding category on here, please go to the Forum (top right-hand corner) and suggest it.

Keep him and the mare apart for a few days and then introduce them again.  Keep both of them in hand at all times, have someone help you.  Take him to her hindquarters and just let him check things out.  Hopefully, he will eventually get ready and breed.  As soon as he does reward him and walk him away from the mare.

46462111857a3dc8ba4a565c74c14907aa	first off, do u know anything about owning, caring , riding and handleing horses and a barn?|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Your layout looks great.  You would want the manure pile somewhere close to the barn, out of obvious sight, and have complete access room for a tractor, manure spreader, and bobcat.  I've been looking at your layout for quite some time and I'm still trying to figure out exactly where to put it.  Also, I would suggest you include a few more doors in you indoor arena.  You need to be able to get a drag in and out, and in the summer months you need to be able to open it up.<br>  <br>  I like the paint mare the most out of all of them, but she has more pleasure and horsemanship lines rather than eventing lines on her papers.  Plus 10 grand is a little much.  I would keep looking around a bit more.  <br>  <br>  Too much weight for jumping.  She would eventually start to show signs of leg, joint, and tendon and ligament problem if jumped too much.  She looks great under saddle though, and I bet she would look gorgeous harnessed up.|`|bf20d1596a080a379eedb6a0fd53c31baa	Your barn layout looks okay but I think you should look at other horses. The first one I feel is the best but certainly not worth that kind of money. I don't know if you know this or not, excuse me if you do but now that so many less women are taking premarin there are hundreds of beautiful horses of all breeds and some of impecable breeding available for reasonable prices.They end up slaughtered if homes are not found for them. It used to be just the PMU foals that met this fate but now with so much less need for their urine the mares as well go to slaughter. I can't tell you how many wonderful horses have been saved and they are mostly registered and many of fabulous pedigrees. Check it out. animali@aol.com is one group that is trying to find homes for them.|`|7fe1b273a9f987230ff6b1a136231dd3aa	I guessed, and put the muck heap in the best place i could think of. It would be better to have it on the top, but you don't really want it near the parking lot. Its far from the barn and arena and house to prevent a fire hazard.

Judge were the wind usually goes and put the muck heap downwind.  As for the horses none of them look perfect. But I would say the first one is best. You could find many better horses for that price.  The last horse is out of the question and the middle is much to heavy to be a good jumper.<br>  <br>  OH and dont buy the last one the chestnut percheron. He is in bad condition and cant jump look at the hooves.<br>  Good luck.

Ask around; somebody might be willing to do that, or even let them stay in their house supervised.<br>  <br>  Even though they're not completely housebroken, you can keep one in the house.  Get a travel crate (relatively inexpensive; if you can afford a dog you can afford one) and put the dog in it while you're gone.  Crate training is a good idea anyway.  Put a sheet or towel in the bottom and if there's an accident, just throw it in the wash.  If you have a tarp or something similar, it's even easier.  Cover the bathroom floor with it, leave food and water, and shut the door.  He might scratch the door and drink from the toilet, but that's better than having his stitches ripped out.<br>  <br>  You could also get some temporary fencing to make a pen for one in the yard if you're not willing to get a crate or keep one in the bathroom.  The best option would be finding a neighbor to look after one or both during those 1-2 hours.<br>  <br>  But anyway, thank you for having your dogs altered.  That's millions of unwanted puppies prevented.

I was able to build trust in my horse, trust in myself and gain extended balance by depending on my own body than depending on a saddle to keep me on (or hold on to in some cases).<br>  <br>  Just like sitting in a chair. Legs together, straight back, arms bent at hip level, with elbows against my sides. My knee's and thighs are pressing up against my horse's side, just behind her heart girth (behind her elbow, almost going towards the middle of her stomach/barrel). <br>  <br>  Depending on the horse's que and how the horse is trained all depends on what I will que my horse to do. Some horses are taught to walk forward by "click click" as other horse are taught to walk forward by pressing heals to the side and saying "walk!". <br>  <br>  I would allow the reins to be at proper length of 4 inch slack (not tight) with head at level to my elbows. <br>  <br>  Depends on how properly trained the horse is depends on how learning to ride will be.<br>  <br>  When stoping the horse, say "whoa", press butt down and lean slightly back (1 to 2 "). While doing so, draw the reins at hip level back so the reins is tight (no slack) that will put pressure on the bit to ask the horse to stop.<br>  <br>  Some horses will take a few repeatness. Others will stop on a dime.<br>  <br>  Backing a horse up is the same thing. Some horses are taught to "click click" while drawing the reins at hip level back (pulling back) slightly (called forward and release, you pull and release, pull and release which takes pressure on and off the bit every other second).  Other horses will require abit more "aggressive" approach by pulling back abit harder, but not to the point it hurts the horse. There is a difference. It is all about pressure. Not pain.<br>  <br>  Learning how to ride requires lessons and proper trainer to gain information, gain riding style skills and to observe.  Learning how to ride on your own is not safe for you, your horse and others around. <br>  <br>  Riding is not even 10% of what a horse is about. You also have to know how to saddle, bridle and even in some cases, learn how to catch the four leg'd fast brats in a 5 acre area. lol.  You also have to learn vet care incase of injury until a vet can arrive, feeding and how their body works so you know if the riding style is fit for that horse. Some horses do not have the body type nor personality to fit riding style. My mare is strictly barrels and western. My oldest gelding is able to do Western and English. My youngest gelding is able to do Western, English, but nothing fast as he is a slow poke. Different saddles fit different people and different horses. Same with bridles and other tack. <br>  <br>  Riding a horse is both fun and hard work at the same time. It can build muscles and make muscles sore that you never knew you had. You will fall off, get kick, get bucked off and even get hospitalized injured. Part of owning a horse as well as the times they are loving, carring and amazing beautiful animals. They should  have respect all the time as you would want to be respected.|`|40bd3a2ed2b4004241d7dccf35207025aa	Honestly, 2 people got it right on the money, MM- you move like your having sex, and whoever said you can't teach someone how to ride horses on the computer.

Show him the proper place to go, and give him a sharp little nip when he "forgets". <br>  <br>  Of course, being human our nipping him would not be the same as his mama's. I've found a short sharp "NO", followed by a long drawn out "bbbaaaadddd" while sounding disappointed in him is actually the best way. <br>  <br>  Most puppies only want to please. If we show him that something he is doing doesn't please us, he's going to want to do better.|`|8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	Crate train.|`|fc159370a3cb1e03fc85374e025c1e88aa	There are certain periods during the day when a puppy needs to go outside to potty - upon waking up in the morning, after breakfast, after playing, after napping, after playing, after dinner, after playing and just before bedtime.  Dogs naturally do not want to potty where they frequent, so they learn quickly to associate being outside with pottying.  Never scold a puppy or rub its nose in it.  Puppies respond better to gentle love and care and can develop behavioral problems when improperly or wrongly disciplined.  The key is to be vigilant to your puppy's routine and to have patience.  Once a routine is established, the puppy will learn to hold it until it is time to go outside.  Be consistent, be loving, be attentive.  In short time, your problem will be solved.  Good luck.|`|24457376cb5cf833a3c6f509ac556bc2aa	Crate train him. Get a crate not much bigger than the puppy and keep the puppy in the crate when you are sleeping, not home or unable to watch him. Take the pup outside to do his business immediately when you take him out of the crate. Take the pup outside to do his business immediately after eating or playing. When you have the puppy out of the crate and are watching him look for signs that he is about to go (sniffing, circling) and take him outside. When he goes outside praise him. If he has an accident in the house and you witness it in a stern firm voice tell him "no potty outside" as you are taking him outside. If he has an accident an you do not witness it unfortunately there is nothing that you can do about it. Do not yell at the puppy or hit him and do not rub his nose in his mess. Make sure you are consistent and persistent with the training.  Always praise a lot when he goes outside.|`|4e939d480bc5c0400b1b91b688340bd6aa	There is an awesome book that you can buy at Petsmart called "I just got a puppy, what do I do?".<br>  <br>  It covers potty training; puppy-proofing, training and everything you need to get started.|`|54e8e27784338112c9444cf75f2d6b95aa	whenever your dog goes in the house scold him then take him outside. your dog will eventually know that going outside is whats its supposed to do. you should also take him or her outside every 15-30 mintues

488e55b09da91754a39ca7a4d1bf5071aa	Okay, I'm not an expert, but do work for a series of veterinary magazines. There have been quite a few problems with shar peis due to the amount of spare skin. The excessive skin folds have been known to cause problems such as poor sight - some of the breed simply cannot see properly due to the amount of spare skin falling over the eyes. Some vets have taken to performing 'face lifts' on severe cases (these, however, can result in behavioural issues in some cases, due to the dog's confusion over suddenly having sight). Could this be a problem in your case? Can your dog 'see' her food properly, or has she become used to finding it more easily if it's being hand fed?<br>  <br>  Sorry if this doesn't help, but it might be worth checking into.<br>  <br>  G'luck|`|AA11548502	Assuming that your dog sees a vet regularly and is parasite free, she may have stomach problems. My husband is a cop and he brought home a dog that he found at a drug raid (they were using her to test what they were making by injecting her). She was only about 6 weeks old.  I SWEAR she didn;t eat for tthe first 6 months of her life. She did exactly what it sounds like you are going through.  She used to burp a lot and act like she had a sore throat; she would look at her food and smell it, but not really eat unless hand fed.  She would occasionaly eat rice or scrambled eggs.  It ended up that she had really bad stomach ulcers that went un noticed until they moved up into her esophogus.  .  As our vet instructed, you can give your dog Prilosec OTC as per the instructions on the box.  It made a big differece with our pup.  She is three now and in excellent weight.  Of course,  if things continue to worsen, the best thing to do would be to see your vet again.

Learn how to speak to your animals if you use a very stern voice and say, "NO!" they should understand no means NO.<br>  <br>  And honestly animals are really a whole lot smarter than everyone swears they are. I have seen some interesting things that animals can do. They know when you are in a good mood or a bad mood. They know when you are in pain and when you are feeling energetic and they will act different for you different moods. And some animals act exactly like their owners! Some even look like them too. Heeheehee its cute. <br>  <br>  Don't judge an animal by it cover.|`|458ea48e2ff4aad3a78121458b9dc1cbaa	NEVER hit a dog.  The reason for this is how a dog thinks and acts.  They do not have a human intelligence and will not know why they were struck, it will only make them scared of the person hitting them.  If you want to train a dog, figure out why the animal is acting in a manner you dislike, then the answer will be simple.

I had this problem when I bought my first saddle.  First, you need to go and try sitting on some saddles.  That's the only way to know without a doubt which size seat fits.  You want to make sure you can't slide around to much and you want to keep the horn away from your mid-section.  You don't want it hitting you every time you go down a hill or your when your horse does something stupid.  I weight 154 pounds and I am a small framed girl.  I use a 16 inch saddle.  It all depends on your size and comfort.  I used to use a 15 inch but now I am more experienced in riding and want more comfort then stability.  Also make sure that you can adjust your stirrups.  <br>  <br>  After you find what is comfortable for you than you need to have a look at your horse.  The main thing to pay attention to your horses withers.  If they are high then you might need a bigger saddle to accommodate them.  You really don't want to end up with a saddle that looks like a hat :  ) on your horse.<br>  <br>  Happy Hunting!!!!

880f482d5bc66b9953961a9405db0e91aa	Typically a horse sees better in the dark than a human.  Their eyes are more attuned since they are a prey animal.  However, if a horse already has a vision problem there could be more risk at duskier times of day.  My gelding had uveitis which blinded him in his left eye & I believe his vision in his right got progressively worse as he aged to the point he spooked at things that should not have bothered him.  He had been thru many trailrides, calf pennings, parades, playdays & was a drill horse.  He went many places & was never bothered until the incurable disease began taking his vision away.  <br>  Horses are flight animals & frighten very easily until they develop respect & confidence in their riders & still the unexpected can happen.  The best anyone can do is expose their horses slowly & kindly to different things so the horse learns that most things will not hurt him & to trust his human.|`|1a35be555a766bded196278b09511a64aa	Sounds like someone has no clue about horses.  <br>  Horses do have a "blind spot", but not from the rising or setting sun!<br>  There are areas that a horse can not see, directly behind him or directly in front of him.  This is why if you ever notice someone walking around behind a horse, they have their hand on the horse's rump.  When you get right behind the horse, you are no longer in his field of vision.<br>  Same as with directly in front of him.

I think the dog will have more of a problem adjusting while your husband is away than when he gets back, and yes dogs can have trouble with this if they have lived in the same enviornment all their lives with the same people.

And they're adorable.  I love dogs.  Did you know according to one study cat people differ from dog people?  The cat people don't value loyalty and affection as much a dog people.

gqjrBmu1aa	I really depends on how healthy and active the horse is. A young, healthy horses hooves will grow much faster than an older or an unhealthy horse. All of my horses get their hooves done every 7 weeks- I have 83 head but only 10 of them are shod. Most people have a time line of every 6-8 weeks though. Depending on if your horse needs a different shod or throws a shoe or another emergency like that- you may have the farrier out much sooner.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	Usually 6-8 weeks through summer and 8-10 in winter but some certainly need more often.  I had a few clients who won't set an appointment until their horse is lame so every 9-12 months.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	All depends on the horse.  6 - 8 weeks is the usual time span between a routine trim or being reshod.  I have 3 broodmares that haven't had their feet don't in over 2 years and they look fantastic.  On the other hand I have a shetland cross pony that needs trimming just about every month.  But, as long as the hooves are staying symmetrical and there are no cracks appearing the average horse can go a good 3 months and stay sound.  Also horses with navicular or have foundered need to be trimmed or just examined more often.|`|275405a012e6255e1b61b8bfb5d78d07aa	Normally a farrier will be used to service a horses hooves when uneven growth effects the horses gait, and more often prematurely to accommodate shoeing.|`|AA11335909	Horses with shoes will need to be trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks.  Barefoot horse that are active will wear their own feet down some and may be able to go as long as 12 weeks between trims.  Of course if they just stand around, their hooves won't get worn down and they will need to be trimmed every 6 to 8 weeks too.|`|IgwWFZ7paa	you should put new shoes on every 6 weeks|`|7c9faeef63df0964fecf050c0389520eaa	you should have them trimmed every 6-8 weeks|`|89f806e3575fb6dc7b14327f12ecdf8caa	about every 6 - 8 weeks depending on whether u r riding ojn the roads alot or if they wear down sooner|`|AA11307969	trimmed every 4-6 weeks|`|b2a5fd6852471574043fc3ea0b28a596aa	It really depends on the horse.  If your horse has shoes, I usually recomend 6 weeks to have the shoes replaced and hoof trimed.  If your horse is barefoot then it can vary.  I am trying to get all of my horses barefoot so during the transition I'm having them trimed every 4-6 weeks, however after the hoof has regrown they will be on a 8-10 week schedule.  It all depends on the horse, some horses hooves grow faster than others and will require more frequent triming.  Also if the horse is being exercised more then the hoof growth will be affected.  Then there are horses like miniatures that are only trimmed about 2-3 times a year.  So I would check with your vet and farrier to see what is best for your horses.|`|deaa43c3ccfa1dc0ce0eb93606e2c3aeaa	every six weeks. and the horse should be the judge as to weather or not it needs shoes. Im a certified equine therapist and see so many horses improperly shod and even horses who do not need shoes. I agree that performance horses need them but back yard horses being ridden once or twice a week for 20 min dont necesarly need them. good luck and good for you being concerned about your horses well being. the world needs more people like you out there. They should be checked every 6 weeks atleast and left tot he discretion of the farrier as to weather or not they should be done not when the horse owner thinks it should be done. If you dont get them looked at then that is neglect!|`|faf538869b1af9525adb6c5277cb79b9aa	I have a colt and his feet have to be done every 6 weeks like clockwork.

They are great family dogs, in part because of their breed function.  Great with kids because they are considered to be "touch insensitive" (the breed had to be ... running in the autumn/winter months through dirt, rocks, brush and jumping into cold waters) which means they do well with kids romping all over them, tugging at their ears and tails, etc.  Be careful, though, since lots of phenogenic breeding has caused some problems.  That basically means that breeders tried to breed good traits into their dogs but, in turn, bred some of the good stuff OUT.  This seems to be especially true with very light, blond Goldens (that color was all the rage awhile ago, so breeders were focusing on that trait and bred out a lot of the good personality traits!).|`|5032e20088dbdef536c2cb47492c8c7aaa	Which golden retriever are you referring to?|`|cc9552f25c3caaab1fd57e65eadbd40faa	very smart dog and big enough to be a decent guard dog.<br>  <br>  good with kids,<br>  <br>  Very protective of family.<br>  <br>  can do alot if trained well|`|x7E2DvPEaa	He is a regal hunting dog and a fine family pet|`|fieKbjFTaa	retrieves...gives affection... does anything a normal dog would do..?!?!

AA10251105	depends on how many you have and how much grass they have and how much grain you feed them. but you can put out a square bale for one to three a day or a round if you have more. hay is something you can let them have all they want|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	About a bale a day for each.|`|AA11887193	In the winter a lot.  I have only a horse and a cow.  They both get fed pellets daily.  I put out a big round bale for them to eat on as they please.  I've been going through one a month since Nov.<br>  <br>  I think my horse eats a lot more of the hay than my cow.  But, I know many farmers having problems trying to find hay and keep enough for their cows this year.|`|4550d1a6940c14994a272912d8cd6de4aa	Hi. I don't have cattle, but I board my horse with a professional trainer and they own some. They feed their cattle corn and hay. The ones that are pregnant get about 4 flakes of hay per day. A flake is what the bales are divided up in. You probably already know this. They get two in the morning and to at night. This is in winter. We live in the tundra of MI and so there is 3 feet of snow on the ground. During the summer months, the cows are left out to pasture and are offered free choice grazing. Depending on your animal's weight, anywhere from 2-5 flakes a day should do well for them. If you have year round grass, a flake at each feeding should be more than enough. Round bales are another option, but due to size, you have no way to limit intake unless you remove the cattle from the field. I know my horse gets 6 flakes a day, but he is a young gelding that shows. I wouldn't give them free choice, in my opinion. It costs a bundle and really isn't neccessary. Milking mothers need more, but you can ususally make this up with corn and grain. Good luck.|`|FlG0bkf5aa	how many? i would say a round bail depending on how many you might need two or three.|`|bT12aItIaa	for cattle, depending on how many and how much grass/hay they get, you could get a round bale and let them have as much as they like, so long as there enough cattle that they dont overeat.|`|e7e21471e35ecd2514498a40db65818baa	i dont own cattle srry

AA11139360	Take a long lead rope and put it around them, just below their rear and above their legs, and guide them using that and the lead on their halter.  Putting pressure on their rear will keep them from setting back, and will keep them moving forward.  If you keep them from setting back in the first place, then there is no need for whips or alternate methods to control that behavior.  You shouldn't tie a horse up and let it set back as much as it wants.  There are hundreds of muscles in their neck that could pull the wrong way, and then you've got a hurt horse.  A horse's head isn't meant to withstand that much pull, and it's their instinct to pull away fron danger, so if they get hurt setting back, that reinforces that being tied is a bad thing.  I generally do not like to tie my horses while working with them anyway.  Try to teach your foals to stand still to be brushed, and once they can be mounted to stand still for that too.<br>  <br>  Try lunging them too.  Keeping them moving forward and teaching them to watch you for commands will help them to obey when you want them to move forward on a lead.  <br>  <br>  Taking another horse with you will also teach them.  Walk an older horse or it's mother and walk it beside you in the other hand (or have someone else hod the other horse).  They will look to that respected horse and copy their example.  <br>  <br>  Remember to take things easy.  Foals like to look around and explore, so instead of plain walking them, try making it fun.  Take them over to a grassy spot to graze, show them some obsticles, and just try to challenge their brains and make them think about something other than the fact they are walking on a lead.|`|f7f979166d56e9db52bddbf243ac866daa	I like the tie and wait them out method.  It also does wonders for their patience when you start doing vet and farrier work.  If you think he'll really panick at being tied use a body rope.  Take a long sturdy "soft" cotton rope and clip it around the barrel behind the withers, pull it snug but not tight, run the long end through the ring at the bottom of the halter and tie it to the post.  This prevents them from pulling against their necks and possibly hurting themselves.  The force of the pull is diverted to the body which is much less sensitive than the head and neck and prevents a broken halter.  A few horses learn they can break halters as youngsters and must be tied with body or neck rope as adults.  Also tie above wither hieght when tying with a halter this also reduces neck strain if they get spooked and pull.  Good luck.  Once they understand not pulling you can also run a long gently snug rope around their rump above the hocks so if they step back they feel something behind them.|`|jo8cHOBxaa	Id definatly go with Kara and/or Sarah h on this one!

Once you have caught the horse (I also recomend leaving a halter and full lead on them, when they step on the lead they start to understand that pressure on the halter means stop) the horse will most likely still be trying to get away from you, so I recomend having two people, one to "sit" on the rope and one to begin to desensitize the horse.  The "sitting" person should have the rope behind his/her rear end to act as an anchor, don't litteraly sit on the ground, you just use your seat as an anchor on the end of the rope.  You can also tie the horse to a sturdy pole, but that is assuming that you can get the horse close to a strudy pole once you've caught them.  The rest is just getting the horse used to humans.  The second person will still be holding on the the rope to help control the horse (because yes they will win the battle of strength)  if they start to pull back just stay with them until you can stop them.  Don't let them think that pulling back gets them away from you, no matter how hard they pull you are still right with them.  But just start to talk to them and rubbing them.  Try to find a spot that they seem to like to be rubbed.  For some its the forehead, some it's under the chin, but just try to find a place that they like.  Then gradually start moving over their body very slowly with your hands.  And when they start to get upset just go back to that spot that they like, and once they've settled again start back to the different places.  Once the horse is used to you and is not at a constant battle to run you can begin to try to get the horse to move forward.  Yes the butt rope is a method that some people use, but I'm not a big fan of it.  It's just too much stuff to get in the way.  I prefer the simple balance method.  I you were to look at a horse from an arial view you would notice that they are long from head to tail but very short from side to side.  Use this to your advantage.  You will never win the battle of trying to pull them straight forward, they have the leverage advantage.  However they are easy to move side to side.  Use the halter to turn their head to the left or right and lean them off balance until they take a step to catch themself.  Praise every step.  They take a step, release the pressure on the halter and scratch that place you found earlier.  Just keep doing this over and over, your horse will begin to understand that the sooner he gives into the pressure the sooner the pressure is released.  You may spend a couple of days doing just one step right one step left, but you will begin to see your horse responding quickly and then you can leave the pressure on and ask for a few more steps at a time.  Just take it slow and don't get frustrated.  Remember he has no clue what you want him to do until you tell him.  So just use their balance against them, and you'll see great results.  I also recomend using a rope halter since it is narrower than a flat nylon or leather one, it creates a sharper pressure that will be harder to ignore than a broad flat pressure.  Best of luck to you, and remember that when dealing with horses you need only two emotions, patience and a sense of humor.|`|f5a831f7257e92140f0db5dc73550d34aa	use pressure towards the ground and release pressure when they do what u want, small steps....|`|0f6e47ea291df3255a761bdc6e3b4942aa	I find that if they want to pull back you tie them to a solid post (not a rail) and then you let them have it.  DO NOT encourage them to "freak" out let them do there thing.  DO NOT leave then unattended either.  Also make sure that they have a good strong halter on and a good strong lead so nothing breaks.  Let them figure it out.  It something breaks then they are getting away with it again.  After they stop tossing around, walk up cautiously and give them a treat, call it a day and try again the next day.|`|2381be44f1a0681c3cf3d6acc0a43e17aa	There are several methods you can use.<br>  1. you can tap them on the rump with a schooling whip which should send them forward.<br>  2. You can put a lunge line on them and place it around their rump about alf way up from the hocks and as they pull back the effect will be the lung line pushes them forward so in reality the are pulling against themselves<br>  3.

I would use a lead rope and clip it on his halter and run it behind him around his rump and back throught the halter. You need a long lead for this. Then I would try to lead him and if he gave me any tugging I would pull on the end and it will push him forward. As soon as he stopped fighting I would release and in about 10 minutes he didn't have any problem following me.|`|bbb7c27b34421ff3470b201ab3e82c57aa	the tried and tested method would be to walk at the foals shoulder with a schooling whip - one long enough to reach his rump. always wear a hard hat (just in case it all goes horribly wrong!) then whenever he shows signs of pulling back you give him a small amount of encouragement with the whip. it doesn't need to be hard just enough to get his attention back to the task in hand.<br>  alternatively you could get a special head collar that has pressure points and which, should prevent pulling back etc.  I've not tried one with my youngsters because i find the first method usually works.<br>  hope you find your solution soon, good luck

But anyway - teach him to drive.  Get long reins and get behind him and work with him until he responds to voice commands to "go." You should be able to drive him like you would guide him with reins if you were in the saddle.<br>  Still, a child small enough to ride this mini will likely be unable to control him, especially if the horse is only green broken. I'd find a trained, older pony for your riding school.

They can jump, but they have a slightly higher knee action and aren't ideally suited for the sport. You see many Irish Draughts crossed with Thoroughbreds, though.

The most practical thing to wear would be either jeans or breeches depending on what's more comfortable, some boots with a little heel for gripping on the stirrup. You might want gloves and a hat, depending on the weather, condition of the reins and how often your horse likes to jerk his/her head and pull the reins tight.|`|9pb6GrUhaa	yer but it is better if u wear the  right things|`|58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I often wear my half chaps when riding.

I've ridden in breeches, paddock boots, and half-chaps before. Half-chaps aren't just for keeping your legs clean and unscathed in the brush.

BoT5zWhtaa	Are you talking about a mechanical hackamore or a bosal?   To fit a bosal feel up your horses nostrils until you feel the bone place the bosal about one inch above where the bone begins. The fiador knot should hang about one inch from his chin. You should be able to easily fit two fingers between the bosal and his jaw bone. If it is too tight or too loose you can add or remove wraps on the mecate to fit. If you are talking about a mechanical hackamore, (which is not a true hackamore) I hate them and never use them or recommend them to anyone.|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	I fit my hackamores and bosals about an inch lower than the halter would normally lie.  They seem to respond a tad better that way.  The bridle shouldn't cause your horse to buck unless he is in severe pain.  I'm sure he was just fresh or being disrespectful.|`|AA11454410	If you are using a hackamore I would suggest not using a mechanical hackamore. Unless you have a lot of experience with using them and/or your horse is hard to control. I have used a flece lined hackamore for many years and have found it to be the best, especially if your horse doesn't neck-rein. The bottom of the hackamore should sit right on the bottom of your horses nasal bone. To size the curb chain, put your index and middle finger under your horses chin and pull back on the reins. The chain shold comein contact with your ingers when the shanks reach a 45 degree angle. If you horse neck reins well, a bosal would be the best however if your horse is a bit headstrong a fleece lined hackamore is better. Hope this helps.

It's kind of like changing their food w/o a transition. Your horse will probably need time to get used to it. I use a hackamore on my horse, and he's okay with it. If you soon see a large bump in front of the noseband, he might have a blood clot there. Watch out for those! My old trainer had a horse that had a clot. If your horse develops one, give him a break from it. Good luck!

If you think your mare is uncomfortable in the mouth I would suggest getting a dentist out to take a look, this should be done annually for a horse of her age anyway.

PBBdapCWaa	A good bet would be that the fish died, then the algae eater attacked the body and did the damage you see.  There are a few bacterial skin diseases that can cause scales to fall off, but they would also take a few days to kill the fishand leave large bloody sores during those few days.  No doubt you would have noticed the sores before the fish died, so I would thing the damage was done after it died of unrelated causes.<br>  <br>  MM|`|AA11901352	MM may be right about that.  Your gold fish remember is a cold water fish and needs lots of dissolved oxygen.  What were the readings in your tank? (Water tests)  There could have been a number of reasons your fish passed.<br>  <br>  Although, loosing scales for a goldfish is a sign of poor neutrituion.  Just because a fish food says gold fish flakes does not mean it contains what is needed for the fish.  Research on what your fish needs.  Green and leafy veggies added as well as a vit. C additive is needed for goldfish needed to be kept in a tank.  An orange now and then helps.  Yep I said orange and green veggies.  Most goldfish food does not contain vit. c which is needed by gold fish for good health.  Goldfish and loache's don't usually fight unless they are fighting for food.<br>  <br>  I am sorry to hear about your fish.|`|AA12033321	Most fish problems are caused by poor water conditions. Do daily 20% water changes & keep lights off when fish are sick. Fish are less stressed in the dark, which makes for faster recovery. Do this until the problem is gone, then continue with weekly water changes. Black Moores are a type of goldfish, they produce ALOT of ammonia & can quickly turn good water into bad. So ammonia testing is a must & even though they are a cold water fish, a little bit of heat is good for them. Keep the tank at about 72 degrees, but not over 75 degrees. Also add some aquarium salt to the water.  I use Doc Wellfish's, follow the directions on the box for goldfish. Good Luck!|`|aPoK3ox4aa	Its not that he got in a fight, rather the amonia level in the tank is high. Since you have had your tank for 6 months, i can assume it was cycled.

Please tell us what you did to it in the past week and we will be able to help you more. But this is what your tank will probably look like, the water is murky white and has a bad bacterial bloom, your fish look all ragged and white.

Bettas are very slow and therefore get their fins eaten. That's why they recommend you put a betta in a tank by itself.

AA12033321	If they don't have a nest box, most times they won't lay any at all. Cockatiels will mate for the sheer fun of it. You can buy a nest box for cockatiels at a pet store. Put a few layers of newspaper in the bottom & then a layer of pine bedding (like for hamsters). You will need to clean this periodically after the chicks are hatched.  It's been a long time since I bred these, but I think it was like 21 days for them to hatch. She will start laying eggs in a few days (If I remember correctly), & usually she will lay one  a day until she has about 5 or 6 eggs. You should be feeding her a calcium suppliment so that she doesn't become egg bound. That can kill her. Also keep a clean cuttle bone in the cage. This provides some calcium. You can also give them Dandelion greens, well washed! They love them. After the chicks hatch, you will need to keep a soft food in the cage for the parents to feed the chicks. I used hard boiled egg mixed with gerber baby cereal & cooked rice (keep refrigerated). Keep a fresh dish of this mixture in the cage at all times. The dish will need to be washed regularly (at each change). You should start feeding this to the parents now so that they can get used to it before the chicks are here. Keep mom & dad together! She is going to need his help raising the chicks! Handle the babies often when they start growing feather & their eyes are open. This will make for better, tamer pets when you go to sell them.  Also PLEASE go on the internet & do ALOT of research BEFORE you decide to breed. This is a very important step before any animal ownership & especially breeding! Good Luck!|`|zMJmHyuAaa	As with all birds,mating has little to do with actual egg laying.A birds egg production is triggered by the length of light within a day.Even though they are mating it could be up to a month before the female begins to lay.|`|4cf35c900baf2aa599f838360f31396eaa	If you really want to breed, wait at least 1 1/2 years. They will need to mature, be put on a good BREEDING diet, not seeds that is birdie junk food. Also, make sure that they are not related!!! If you breed birds that are related the chicks will either be severly damaged genetically or will not survive at all.<br>  <br>  Cockatiels live for up to 30 years, so it will not hurt to wait.  Cockatiels will go through the act of mating as young as 9 months, but that is not a medically safe time to allow them to breed.  They are still babies then themselves!<br>  <br>  YOU will need to do LOTS of work and research. <br>  If your birds abandon the chicks or refuse to feed, you will have to step in and feed the chicks. This is AROUND THE CLOCK. They would then need to be in a brooder so they could digest their food properly, otherwise they will die. If they are handfed incorrectly, they can die a very slow, painful death from crop burn, slow crop, pneumonia, or infection.<br>  <br>  I'll go into a short list of things that you as a responsible person will need to do before allowing your birds to breed.<br>  <br>  First, do not put the nest box in the cage until you do your research.<br>  <br>  Go to the book store and purchase a book on how to raise and breed cockatiels.<br>  <br>  Go to the vet and learn how to properly handfeed, just in case they toss or abandon the chicks. They can also help you out if your hen becomes eggbound. This can be and is usually fatal if not treated immediently.<br>  <br>  Find buyers for any and all chicks that hatch, before you let them breed. There are LOTS of birds out there due to overbreeding that are in need of homes, most are cockatiels and budgies (parakeets) due to the ease of breeding these birds.<br>  <br>  Why do you want to breed? Is it to better the species, or because you think they need to? <br>  Do you know the background of both birds? <br>  Did their parents have any problems? <br>  Are your birds on a good breeding diet? <br>  Do they have enough calcium to prevent eggbinding? <br>  Do they have fresh foods offered daily?<br>  <br>  If you cannot answer all of those questions, then I would not breed. <br>  <br>  If they are not on a good breeding diet, pellets, fresh foods, and very little seed, you may loose one of your birds during the breeding, or have chicks that are sickly. <br>  <br>  Here is another good resource for breeding birds.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cockatiels.org/articles/breeding/breeding.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatiels.org/articles/breed...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cockatiel.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatiel.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cockatielcottage.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockatielcottage.net/</a>|`|ONLzkkILaa	It actually depends when they mated.Keep track on a calender so you can know next time.

Luckily they don't eat any of those foods.  If it was me I would be calling them every day!  I might even think about hiring a lawyer!  I agree that the poison should never entered the US.  That's what you get when you get wheat from overseas!  If that could happen to pet food then us humans are in great jeopardy of our food getting contaminated!|`|zX2Ce5dYaa	They probably can't get to everyone.  There was quite a few brands on that list.  I'm truly sorry for your loss.|`|x6uaGeEEaa	So sorry to hear about your lost.!!<br>  <br>  Thinks its about time we should do something about that...!!!<br>  <br>  One by one beloved pets have to suffer..!<br>  It's no excuse..!!

AA11168707	I have never done it myself but pygmy goats can be housetrained.  They are as intelligent as dogs and make wonderful pets.  Always make sure any houseplants are well out of their reach or they will eat them and they can be amazing climbers also.<br>  <br>  For house training at first I would keep the kid on a collar and leash.  Take him/her to the box after every nap, meal, play session, ect.  It may take a while but eventually he/she will get the hang of it.  Also, be aware that goats have more control over urination than they do over their "berries".  So be prepared for accidents and be patient during the learning period.  Scolding will do no good at all.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats on your new pet!|`|AA11480425	by far the weirdest question I have ever answered..<br>  <br>  You don't..They are barn animals...you silly goose|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Get a nice big shallow leak-proof box and make sure to cover the floor around it with newspaper.  You don't need much litter in the box, just about 2".  Go to your local farm store and pick up some doe urine.  Sprinkle it in the litter and show the kid where it is.  Whenever he starts to pee somewhere he is not suppose to, pick him up and place him in the box.  Don't reprimand him if he misses a little, he will get the hang of it.  Good luck|`|PLn4MA6waa	By  pouting  on  the  BBQ   pit  goats  never  get  trained  they  are  rebels  why  you  thing  they  had  Jesus  birth sign  Capricorn??

I got an email from Purina and they told me that there food is just fine. They are not in the recall. All the cat food that you named is just fine. Purina is not on the recall list. They make there own cat food that  is dry. Let your friend know to let the fda know that Special kitty dry food killed his kitty. Good luck and I feel sorry for your friend. Have your cats tested asap.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  purina pulled their Mighty max dog food and alpo and that is the only thing that they sent out of the country.|`|6ff5cbdd5afaac56472a9e0f95d03293aa	this is the only dry cat food I found that was recalled HILL'S RECALLS PRESCRIPTION DIET m/d DRY CAT FOOD. Other than that the rest were all wet food. Here is the site I went to that has all the brands that were recalled and updated information as to what is going on with the FDA and what the new chemical that could be causing the animals to die. <br>  Purina sent this to me via e-mail yesterday:<br>  ALPO? BRAND PRIME CUTS IN GRAVY CANNED DOG FOOD<br>  VOLUNTARY NATIONWIDE RECALL <br>  <br>  No Dry Purina Products Involved <br>  <br>  March 31, 2007 <br>  <br>  On March 30, 2007, Nestlé Purina PetCare Company announced it is voluntarily recalling all sizes and varieties of its ALPO? Prime Cuts in Gravy wet dog food with specific date codes. The Company is taking this voluntary action after learning that wheat gluten containing melamine, a substance not approved for use in food, was provided to Purina by the same company that also supplied Menu Foods. The contamination occurred in a limited production quantity at only one of Purina's 17 pet food manufacturing facilities. <br>  <br>  Consumers should immediately stop feeding their dogs ALPO Prime Cuts products with the date codes listed below and consult with a veterinarian if they have any health concerns with their pet. <br>  <br>  The recalled 13.2-ounce and 22-ounce ALPO Prime Cuts cans and 6-, 8-, 12- and 24-can ALPO Prime Cuts Variety Packs have four-digit code dates of 7037 through 7053, followed by the plant code 1159. Those codes follow a "Best Before Feb. 2009" date. This information should be checked on the bottom of the can or the top or side of the multi-pack cartons. <br>  <br>  Importantly, no Purina brand dry pet foods are affected by the recall – including ALPO Prime Cuts dry. In addition, no other Purina dog food products, no Purina cat food products, Purina treat products or Purina Veterinary Diet products are included in this recall, nor have been impacted by the contaminated wheat gluten supply.<br>  <br>  At Purina, nothing is more important to us than the health and well-being of the pets whose nutrition has been entrusted to us by their owners, and we deeply regret this unfortunate situation. We will continue to take any and all actions necessary to ensure the quality and safety of our products.<br>  <br>  Please see our March 30 press release for more information and click here for an updated list of Frequently Asked Questions. If you have more questions or concerns, please contact our Office of Consumer Affairs at 1-800-218-5898.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers ur question.|`|gQiaN8Yvaa	Menu Foods does not produce any dry pet food. Only wet food. Hill's pet food has now announced a dry pet food recall as of Friday March 30 and I'm sure others will follow suit shortly. Purina has also isssued a recall on it's Alpo cuts in gravy in all sizes and varieties as well. This is also wet food. This recall will probably encompass most of the pet food industry, but Menu Foods has done all the work and taken all the heat for the other companies. They said all along this wheat gluten was the problem, but the other companies waited 2 more weeks before recalling their comtaminated food.|`|x6uaGeEEaa	Its so scary to hear of all these thing happening to our beloved.!<br>  I know your Purina is not affected.<br>  I am feeding mine with science diet and I am not taking any chances. <br>  So I cook food for my kitten  until all things is settled.<br>  I know its going to be a long time for them to sort out the pet food.<br>  So what i did is to cook a bit more and freeze them.<br>  My kitten seems to be happy enjoying my new recipes for her.<br>  You can also try doing for your pet.<br>  <br>  If you are not sure of any recall, just check out in the website on pet food recall. Even Purina has a list of the recall pet food.<br>  <br>  Good luck..!!!
gqjrBmu1aa	Organize everything and do run throughs with your family watching the week before and then again 2 days before your show. Give your cow's a break the day before that way when you get to the show they won't be worn out and bored with showing routines. Be sure to pack extra leads and halters.<br>  Also, keep up with your grooming tools. Do regular maintenance on clippers, vacuum, and brushes. Your vacuum will likely become your best friend so if you don't have one already, I would get one that is made for the grooming of cattle and horses. About 2 weeks before the show clip your cattles face and legs this way it will look clean and natural and not like the clipping had been done right before the show.<br>  About a week before shows add extra feed to your cattle's diet. When in stress and on the road they will drop weight incredibly, by adding a few extra pounds by the time you get to the show your cow will still be at a good weight without being under.|`|ImKWEIhDaa	yuo & me|`|232e4e6ba2bc0d7353269ae014be1e89aa	Just be prepared for anything.  Make sure you clip them 2 - 3 weeks before the show.  Practice everything and make a list of the equipment you need to bring.  Bathe them the day before.  Bring extra halters and leads.

I have seen they drinking kitten milk supplement and water (some soft food) as young as 3 weeks. You may have to show them by pushing their faces gently into the saucer, the will lick what is on their faces and get taste and try it on their own. You may have to do this several times before they get the hang of it. NO HUMAN MILK !!!! It will give them the squirts and that is a mess.

AA10859773	Pull out the Yellow Pages and look under Pet supplies.  Look for independent stores - they're more likely to carry the better brands.<br>  <br>  You can also check at any organic store in your area - Whole Foods is one (here in Milwaukee) that sells SOME good brands.<br>  <br>  Don't bother with Petsmart - they only sell junk that I've seen.  Petco sells Natural Balance and Eagle Pack.  Some other chain stores will carry one or two of the better brands as well.<br>  <br>  And you can always purchase online.<br>  <br>  One thing - you still need to read your labels.  I'm not up to speed on the laws, but just because it says organic doesn't mean it's good.<br>  <br>  Choose any or all of the foods from the link below.  That article may help you identify the good ones, but if not the general rule of thumb is that MEAT should be one of the first three ingredients, avoid "byproducts" "meal" and run away if you see any version of corn, wheat or soy.  Don't be taken in by ingredients such as peas, rice, blueberries, cranberries, etc. - although they SOUND healthy, they're not really a required food for cats.  They won't really hurt anything, but I personally think they're just filler and are marketed to the owners rather than to the cat's requirements.|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	Online or in High end retail stores. <br>  <br>  I am so glad that this whole recall is finally making people take notice of the crap they feed their animals. <br>  <br>  I’m glad you’re looking into a new food for your cats. <br>  <br>  It's time for pet owners to wake up and take responsibility for what they feed their animals and quit trusting what those great big money hungry companies tell you.

Premium foods are usually more expensive than "grocery store" foods because their ingredients are of a higher quality, and are therefore somewhat more beneficial and digestible.

They should not contain artificial preservatives, flavors, or colors. They will almost always be fortified with additional vitamins and minerals, and will use the best natural sources for fatty acids to help build healthy skin and a beautiful coat. Because healthy foods use high quality ingredients, you should expect to pay a little more than you would for other types of pet food. Remember, though, with healthy foods you can feed less since healthy foods are more nutrient-dense than other types of food.<br>  <br>  With all that in mind, when you are choosing a new cat food, study the ingredients.

The first ingredients listed should be whole meat ingredients, protein sources, such as Chicken or Turkey. NOT just the word “meat”, who the heck knows what that is? The word Chicken Meal is ok, but it should be a secondary ingredient, not first. Meal is the meat dehydrated and ground into a powder. <br>  <br>  The ingredients also should NOT include any by-products whatsoever. Those are disgusting left over animal parts that are scraped off the floor of meat and poultry plants, which should just go into the trash but go into pet food instead. EW!!!! Also make sure there are no artificial colors or flavors. And make sure there is no BHA and BHT used preservatives. These preservatives have been shown to cause cancer. <br>  <br>  Be aware though that when switching to a better food, you will pay for what you get. Good foods are not cheap.

They can look like they are gonna pop any second for the last three weeks. The best thing to do is have her checked by a vet. I would suggest either kitten food or a food especially format ed for pregnant and nursing mothers to help keep her calcium up. We usually get some pet milk powder to sprinkle on their dry food. Also they have vitamin es your vet can give you to help keep her healthy and promote healthy kittens. She will need extra protein and love during this time.

However, this<br>  article will detail some ideas you can try, so that your dog<br>  stops this disgusting habit.<br>  <br>  <br>  Avoid ‘It’<br>  <br>  One of the best dog potty training methods is avoidance. Don’t<br>  let your dog see anything he shouldn’t be eating, and he won’t.<br>  However, this is almost impossible when talking him for a walk,<br>  or really anywhere outside for that matter. For starters, at<br>  least make sure you are cleaning up after your own dog before he<br>  can get into it, and avoid places that you know are more<br>  ‘infested’ than others.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep Careful Guard<br>  <br>  Make sure to go outside with your dog each time he needs to take<br>  a potty break. Then, you can watch him to make sure if he’s<br>  decided to get into the nasty stuff. If he does, use one of the<br>  obedience commands you’ve taught him, and reward him for<br>  listening. For instance, if he’s going for the doody, tell him to<br>  “Sit!”, and reward him immediately. Then you can guide him back<br>  into the house and avoid the situation altogether. A word to the<br>  wise here, though – try and frame what you want to say to your<br>  dog in positive terms, so he knows what’s expected of him. Just<br>  saying, “No!” doesn’t tell him what to do, it just tells him that<br>  he shouldn’t be doing it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Use a Leash<br>  <br>  In addition to the tip above, use a leash to reinforce this dog<br>  potty training method when taking your dog for a walk.<br>  <br>  <br>  Make It Inedible<br>  <br>  There are a wide variety of ways to do this, although they can be<br>  very frustrating, since every piece of something that your dog<br>  shouldn’t eat needs to be covered with it. However, if no other<br>  dog potty training methods work, try placing some bitter orange,<br>  super hot sauce or Tabasco on every ‘piece’ to deter consumption.<br>  <br>  <br>  Supplement<br>  <br>  Your veterinarian may have something they can provide you with<br>  that you add to your dog’s every meal to stop him from eating<br>  what he shouldn’t. One product is called “For-Bid”, although some<br>  people use meat tenderizer instead (just mix a little bit in<br>  before every feeding).<br>  <br>  (c) 2005 dog-training-info.com<br>  Kevin Simmons is the webmaster of <a href="http://www.dog-training-info.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dog-training-info.com</a>  .

Try Adolph's meat tenderizer in their foot, the taste is a deterrant.|`|9fb19f7b0ac6f68c787a11204f93d258aa	I't is normal all puppies do this because of immatureity.

There is help though, a product available at the pet stores that you can feed the older dog (just add it to his food) that will make his feces taste as disgusting as we truly feel it is.  I believe it is called 'Deter' but may be available under a dozen different names.<br>  You'll still have to keep an eye on the younger one though, if you walk them on a leash.  He could still be attracted to other dog's waste.|`|AA11396200	When she gos &eats da poo shout at her DO NOT HIT HER!<br>  it just doesnt work if u hit her tellher off and wen u get home send her to bed thats wat i did with my dog  and she stoped it <br>  Good Luck!!|`|KWrNHXWraa	i know when a dog eats cat poop it means they r lacking something in their own food, not sure about other dogs poop though, but at the pet store like petco or pet smart they sell something u put in ur dogs food that will make the other pup not want to eat it (the poop) it works i used it on my cat so my dog wouldnt eat it.|`|hx9tyRB7aa	it's very common.  dogs love eating poop and dead things.  they have heightened smell and taste organs and for some reason that stuff tastes good to them.  the best advice i can give you as a dog owner for 20+ years is to watch them closely when they're outside and discipline them when you see them starting to eat that (yelling no and making a loud noise like clapping usually does the trick).  but dogs are also sneaky.  i mean, it would be like telling you that you could never have chocolate again (or whatever your favorite dessert/food is).  so, they'll be doing their darndest to eat it when you're not watching.|`|oxotueCVaa	feed it you stupid womanj<br>  M reynolds<br>  Reynolds bichons<br>  <br>  Bichon Club of great britain<br>  <br>  President for life<br>  <br>  I also say that the Dungers like with me when they actually live in France, this is so they can cheat the UK tax systema dn claim money in france.<br>  basically I am helping them rob U the Tax payer<br>  <br>  The tax people cant do anything about it cos we are so smart.<br>  Did you know we were bankers <br>  <br>  M and J reynolds UKS best Bichons breeders|`|zi7dkNjQaa	Copophagia is a very common problem and unfortunately, not all dogs grow out of it.

AA11901352	There should be a spot towards her tail called a gravid spot.  This will start to change colors.  Chances are if you have a male, she is prego.

Other fish will eat them though. So unless you have other kinds of fish in the tank, you shouldn't need to put her in the "breeder thingy". Also, the breeder box can't hold them until they are big enough, you will need to set up another tank. A 10 gallon should do it. Use a sponge filter in the baby tank, power filters can suck up the babies.|`|P9yX0zkOaa	if they are female and have been exposed to males, then they are pregnant. they are mollies!|`|Zynn453Daa	OK check this out can you tell male from females ? if not email me thought askyahoo link I ll  tell you .And yes if it is female and is fat it probaly is preg.|`|ovPv8XePaa	I assume you're talking about your fish.

AA11834874	The smaller parrots are good companions for budgies. These include cockatiels, and perhaps even some of the smaller conures such as painteds and green cheeks. Linnies can be very good companions though at this time I'm not sure how aggressive they are. If you want your birds to hang around each other, I would avoid love birds as they're one of **THE** most aggressive parrots available. <br>  <br>  Cockatiels - both male and female - Can learn to talk. Males may learn faster but females Can be just as talented.  They're also very sweet, gentle birds that generally get along with everyone.<br>  <br>  Most small conures can learn a few words. They're not the clearest talkers and talk in small, gravelly voices that sound as if someone is mumbling in a microphone. Many conures can be ripe little bullies, so you'll want to make sure your budgie and conure get along before they're allowed out to play with each other.<br>  <br>  There's other options out there, too. Try to keep birds of similar size as companions and make sure each bird gets their own cage unless they're the same species. The exception to this would be having budgies and cockatiels in the same cage. Even then it's suggested that they be kept in an aviary where they can escape eachother if the budgie becomes a pest.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide in the end - Good luck! :-)|`|bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	Sorry to burst your bubble, but parakeets (properly known as budgerigars or budgies) ARE parrots and they ARE extremely intelligent. Don't assume just because they're little that they're dumb. Budgies have a vocabulary, too, you know.<br>  <br>  Don't bother getting another bird if all you want is a talker. What I would suggest is concentrating on the budgie you have now. You can easily teach this one to speak if it is bonded to you enough to feel the need to try and mimic you.<br>  <br>  That said, /never/ inter-cage different species of birds or parrots. It only leads to trouble, and sometimes death or fatal injury. Some species are territorial by nature, and some are selfish or posessive of territory and items by personality. It's not worth the gamble. A pet store near me had a large cage for a cockatiel and a budgie. They were cages together for a while, not really bothering each other. One day, the cockatiel escaped with a bloodied wing and later died. Any and every bird can and will defend itself, and all parrots have the advantage of their hook bill when they fight, so it does significant damage to all parties in the fight.|`|IVvw3zqRaa	It is a male parakeet that holds the world record for number of words and phrases spoken.  Generally, handfed males are the ones that talk the most, although I have heard females and non handfed parakeets speak.  Personally, I would NOT keep multiple species together.  Even if they seem to get along, there may be other negative consequences.  One bird may be more aggressive at the feeding stations.  You can put all the food dishes you want in the cage but if a more dominant bird wants to prevent the other one from eating, they will man ALL the dishes.  My suggestion would be to keep one bird per cage and IF they seem to get along, they could be allowed out to play in a neutral play area during the day SUPERVISED.  <br>  If you want a good talking bird, the Quaker is an excellent choice.  Males tend to talk better than females but again, a generalization, not a 100% rule.  I used to tell my customers, do NOT purchase a bird strictly on their (supposed) ability to speak.  They may disappoint you and never utter a word.  There is no guarantee a bird will learn to talk!<br>  Good luck with your feathered friends.  Appropriate size cages, good diets (lots of people food NOT just seed), and lots of love and interaction will make your bird happy and healthy!|`|YfRGsNJ9aa	You should only ever keep similar sized birds together such as cockatiels and budgies. A cockatiel is an excellent choice as the males will learn to talk and whistle and the females can learn to whistle though they're not likely to. <br>  They're easy to tame and if you buy a handraised one they'll love you forever. <br>  I have a  rosella in with two cockatiels and the only reason they havnt fought as of yet is because the cage is permanently open on top and the door so they can't chase each other. They're also all handraised so a bit quieter but if the rosella was in with the cockatiels in a normal cage they'd be in trouble. <br>  I don't recommend keeping any parrots with parakeets as they will attack them and maybe kill them.|`|dQTu1Egmaa	i would not recommend it.  They are very territorial.  You can only put parrots with other parrots, and parakeet with parakeet.  Some people have said they were able to.  the only way i could see it possible would be if they were raised from birth together.|`|q5iZHImoaa	I would suggest one similair in size such as a cockatiel, they make great pet's and both male and female learn very quickly but males learn the fastest.
bcca81e3a01eecd371f088c347c05a2aaa	As long as you quarantine the new bird in a separate cage in a separate room for at least 30 days and have it checked by an avian vet first. If you don't want to get your first bird sick, you HAVE to quarantine to make sure the second bird is healthy.<br>  <br>  When you do introduce them after the quarantine, I would suggest a parrot cage divider. Chicken wire, I don't believe is safe because I think it's galvanized, where birds often die from toxic metal poisoning when they make contact with their beaks while climbing. The safest thing you can get for a divider would be stainless steel, or failing that, a powder coated divider.|`|KeevlZnTaa	First off chicken wire is often galvanized(which is toxic to birds). When you first get a bird it needs to be quarantined(at least a month) before introducing them(health reasons).

FVGnBDYKaa	If you want to pet him or do massaging and handeling with him then give his mouth something to do. Hold a compressed rawhide in one hand and pet with the other. Im wondering when he was taken away from his Momma. It sounds like he never learned biting inhibition, which he would have learned between 5 and 7 weeks of age.<br>    I can promise you that as long as you do your part, Obediance classes will work for you. They will teach you consistancy, Patience and timing. Thats all training is.<br>    This dog is unsure of where he belongs in his pack. And if he has been allowed and rewarded somehow for this behavior, Then it will continue. PetSmart courses are excellent as long as you work the program. We can only show you and help you through it. We will tell you what you should and shouldnt do. Like you should never touch, talk to or look at him when he nips you. A loud EH EH!!! And leave him. Remove your whole life away from him.

PBBdapCWaa	There is only one true Dwarf Gourami (Colisa lalia) , but it comes in as many color varieties as you care to name.  Many also have different names in different areas.  Add to the confusion with the fact that some varieties of Honey Gourami (Colisa chuna) and even some varieties of Thick lipped Gourami (Colisa labiosa) are passed off as color varieties of dwarf gourami simply because they are small and about the same shape.  The first time I ever saw Chocolate gourami (Sphaerichthys osphromenoides) for sale they were marked Browm Dwarf Gourami.<br>  <br>  Powder Blue, Red, Neon and Sunset are all typically Dwarf Gourami (Colisa lalia).<br>  <br>  MM|`|CjPtAEzmaa	There is only one type, but it comes in about, 4 or 5 colors.

BLzeagzhaa	I have, in the past, had many cats and they all have different personalities. The older your female cat is, the greater the chance for problems. In all of my life, I have never heard of a cat killing another cat, although I am sure it has happened. If you get a new cat, a very young kitten would be the best. Make certain to avoid territorial problems by providing the new kitten with it's own food and water dish that is a good distance away from where you feed your cat. Good chances are your cat will absolutely love the companionship once she gets used to the new kitty. If you are uncertain as to whether or not things will work out, some animal shelters will allow you to bring home the kitten on a trial basis. Since you have four children, they will be able to keep the new kitten very occupied and your current cat will not feel left out because there are enough humans to interact with. If it were just you, things might be a bit more difficult! I don't think you have anything to worry about.|`|GcRoDqr6aa	Yes, but make the introductions slowly, and be prepared for fighting in the beginning.|`|Nl3sfXxRaa	Yes you should. cats are social animals who live in packs in the wild. They hunt together and what not. Our Mr. Kitty is also so very spoiled ( he drinks only fresh cold bottled water and He has all types of toys and his house. Your girl kitty will most likely be highly pissed at you for the first week. I'll share what happened when we got a kitten. Our 1 year olf male kitty hid all day and wouldn't come out until 10- 11 at night then he would run in our room and sit on his house for a few hours we would let him out our bedroom (don't like litter box in our room) before we go to bed and same thing hiding all day. Here is what is very important when your kitty does come out of hiding just make sure that you still spoil her and tell her what a pretty kitty she is. I would have seperate litter boxes and food dishes so she wont get too jealos. if you have a cat house for her good. if not i would suggest getting her a cheap one so she has someplace to feel comfy and safe. Now here is what happened after the week was up I would catch Damien (older kitty) in the kitchen with the kitten and he would get big eyed and run like he got caught. he preteneded like he didn't like her. then he finnaly gave up after everyone caught him and he loved her to death. he doesn't hide anymore and he even holds her down and cleans her like he was her mommy. Just don't force them to meet they can smell each other just by being in the same house and will get used to each other's smells. In your case since she is so spoiled chances are she will reject another female cat so get a male kitten just make just you spay and neuter them both.|`|9qU9ojuDaa	Hazel`eyes`(Night` Fever)                                                            Nea Nea`:: ive got 3`Cats`all                                                     Toms`-7-6-5`Y/old`-all doin`Well`                                                                                       ?`suggest`buy`a kitten`your`                                               other`will get`on`better`/ i got a                                     big`Garden` surrounded`by`                                      Luvley`Flowered`  Trees`the`                                          Girls`Call it`Malcos`Eden`?`                 getting`ready`4`the`Barbacue` When`The`Sun`Shines`again`?`                                        ha`ha`will you`be`Ready`?|`|lH5evL3qaa	jessica_and_jay8883, cats don't live in packs in the wild. Lions live in prides, but even they have hierarchy. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I think getting another cat wouldn't hurt. Though a few brawls may break out at first, eventually they'll probably tolerate each other. Just make sure you give them equal attention.

Ayju6Wjxaa	Funny you ask.  We were just doing this with my son's dog last night. <br>  <br>  I use the clicker method of training.  If you are not familiar with that then go here first:  <a href="http://www.frontierrots.com/clicker.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.frontierrots.com/clicker.htm</a><br>  <br>  Now that you've loaded your clicker there is a 4 step process.  First you have to train your dog to sit then to lie down on it's belly then to roll from his belly to his side then from his side to the opposite side (thus rolling over).  <br>  <br>  To do teach him to sit, hold a treat in your hand and let the dog see it.  Put the treat in front of the dogs nose and slowly move the treat over the top of his head.  He will follow it with his eyes and as you move it past his brow, he should sit.  Click and treat when he does this.  Repeat a multitude of times.<br>  <br>  Now you have to teach your dog to lie down.  Have the dog sit, click and treat.  With another treat in your hand put it in front of the dogs nose and move your hand down and forward slowly.  The dog will follow the treat and should lie down.  If he does, click and treat.  Repeat a multitude of times.<br>  <br>  Now have your dog sit then lie down.  With a treat in your hand and your dog in the prone position put the treat in front of his nose again and slowly move it along the floor to his left or right and move it back over his neck line.  If he's following the treat with his nose he should lie down on his side.  Click and treat.  Repeat.<br>  <br>  Have your dog sit, lie down then lie on his side.  Again with the treat in front of his nose, continue moving it across his neck keeping the treat just out of reach.  She should roll from one side to the other.  Repeat until he does it on command.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|27d2fe79dd9df7b907483b0eb75c1a39aa	You can get a puppy to do about anything for a treat.  <br>  <br>  If your pup already knows when he sits he get s atreat then teach down to get a treat.

I done this for about 2 weeks & gave her the treat only when she rolled over now i say her name then lay down then rollover & i said those four words every time while i was teaching her then gave her the treat & said she was a good girl every time she did it. she know she wasn't getting a treat unil she rolled over now as when i tell her to rollover i wave my open hand over the top of her. & she does it i am still trying to get her to shake hands not working.|`|dRzdlf9Vaa	Easy answer:  1.) have pup lie down, 2.) hold treat in front of the pups nose, 3.) slowly move the treat from the pups nose to the top of his shoulder blades.  <br>  <br>  If you use a good enough treat, the nose will follow.  When the head goes to the shoulder, gravity takes over and the pup rolls on his side.<br>  <br>  It may take a few times, but the pup should get it!  Good luck!|`|xDkU9vozaa	well..in my opinion, i would say that the best way to teach a pup to reward it with a treat! it would motivate the dog to do what it can to recieve it.

I am sorry that you have to be inconvenienced because your neighbors won't properly care for their pets. Goats are actually great pets to have. It is sad to hear. I have included a list of food that goats will eat just in case you come up with something else missing. I have included the web site in case you might want to check it out. This is far from the whole list of foods that they will eat though.

f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	It depends on where you live really. The average that I have sold a corgi is between $700 - $1000 in for A.K.C pups here in California. They are great dogs! Very smart and easy to train. They are also a loving breed that is great around children.|`|0bb9a919e42b42531162180bccba925faa	Probably $300.- $1000. for a Purebred depending on conformation, wether it's show quality or pet. Cool little dogs! Good luck!|`|bHkSmwbzaa	My mother's Pembroke Welsh Corgi was $550.  Like the others said, $300-1,000 is a good range.  I'd say typically you could expect to pay $500-800 for a purebred Pembroke Welsh Corgi.|`|hEQeTW64aa	Depends on the breeder and whether its show quality or not. Go to a dog show and talk to a breeder there. Please also beware of dogs that are registered CKC Continental Kennel Club, it is a joke registry they will register about anything as long as it has 4 legs. Stick to AKC breeders and a do a bit of research and youll be sure to find yourself a very well bred Corgi.
f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	Dobermans are great breeds. I have a Friend that shows and breeds dobies. But like all dogs, there has to be good training to go with the breeding. Breeding a dog should be done only by those that know what they are doing and are in it for the dogs not the money. Backyard breeding is fine if you do not plan to sell the pups because selling a purebred should only be done by U.S.D.A. licensed breeders. If you don't plan on breeding or showing your dog, the dog should be spayed or neutered to prevent unwanted pups. Puppy mills need to be shut down, they can not guaranty the health of a dog, nor are they a pleasant place for the breed pairs to live. Backyard breeders also can not guaranty the health of puppies they sell. It is best to purchase purebred puppies from a licensed breeder or rescue. In some states such as California, there are strict laws governing puppies sold in pet stores to prevent sick and unhealthy pups from being sold and forcing the store to document everything about where the puppy came from and what medications and vaccinations the pup has received.|`|619b7924e0147931faf7dba78f679f91aa	i think they are a very striking breed of dog..  they do need to be trained.   they also need something to do like agility or obedience.     because they are very intelligent breed of dog. yes if you are not going to breed the dog  then have it spayed or neutered.     i like the looks of the dog with ears cropped.  but if you live a country that does not allow this.   they still can be showen  in the breedring.

See you there!|`|80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	yes, but i cant think of them now, a good one is an appaloosa site, try typing horse forums in to a google or yahoo search engine.<br>  <br>  A good onw is usually seen by having a good heading, an authorised and organised forum, such as a breed association or a group of individuala s who have organised a group for e.g paint horses or for mini ponies.
twnw38Xlaa	Does your dog sunbath?  I've noticed that my min pin is always laying in the sun and now his belly is all dark brown and the birthmarks he has are black.  I would watch them and as long as there not getting bigger or growing you should be fine.  Good luck!|`|8HbXCuvbaa	Most likely its just because he is getting older, nothing to worry about.|`|30YCgGGdaa	This is completely normal.  I have a maltese and a poodle mix and when they were babies they had really pink skin, now they both have beige, caramel skin on their tummies and birthmarks appeared.  I once asked the vet, and he said it was nothing.

80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	Sweet itch is an insect bite taht becomes a reaction. It is cause by midges taht are attracted to sweet blook, and come at dusk and dawn, the midges are mostly seen in the hotter months and hotten places it is also cxalled Queensland Itch because of this heat factor.<br>  <br>  Firstly, make sure your pony is rugged before dusk and unrugged after the sun has come up. That way, he is protected when they are out, a full body suit is best, head to toe and tail.<br>  <br>  Next, to prevent it, anmd treat it, feed garlic in their feed, and dont feed molasses if you need to, use little, and dilute it using water, also add other yummy things like carrots!<br>  <br>  To treat it, you can make a mix by usiung oil and car things, but i dont know the recipe, and i dont know how well it work,s<br>  <br>  I use garlic and then when and if they do get teh itch, use an itch formula from your local saddlery, thee skin will appear broken and sore, you will need to keep it from getting infected, usually once they get it, its hard to stop, but in winter, theyt usually get less of it.<br>  <br>  Is your horse black? if so, tahts common for  a black horse, if ot, then it may be an allergic reaction to a tree bark or to the midges!<br>  <br>  Try teh garlic and seek vet advice if it doesnt work, i hope this helps<br>  <br>  also, a new product called Tuff Rock Poulitice, ican be used to put over the wound, it has been known to reduce scarring on old scares, and promotes hair and tissue growth.|`|gg6iygfoaa	hi, my donkey Angus has sweet itch and you really can't miss it! he or she will scratch all the time and along the main and top of the tail she/he will have scabs. i have given him lots of different treatments over the years but my farrier gave me the best! give him/her a crushed garlic clove morning and night. i don't know how it works but it certainly has improved Angus s urge to itch|`|AA11061445	if your pony has sweet itch he will be rubbing his neck mane and tail against anything he can to relieve the itching.<br>  the skin will be scabby and red in some cases,its the midges that cause it by biting your horses skin,some horses are more prone to it than others.<br>  my friend has a welsh cob who suffers terribly with it and she uses benzol benzonite its a lotion and it helps to stop him scratching so much,she also turns him out at night when the midges are not so bad.she also uses a light weight rug which goes up his neck and over his tail to prevent him rubbing himself.if you think your horse has it i would contact a vet to be sure good luck
80df948c33b8e772d4a35ce0f8072db9aa	The age is great, as a young horse with a huge potential a nd life, this would easily get you $1000 to $2000, then add the training, if its competing, then tahts an added bonus, it would also depend on what type of training, if its an Appaloosa or QH, then the breed would also come into affect. Training would add another $50 0 or $1000, to teh price, if its a breed, then a person looking for that type of horse would realistically be looking for it.<br>  <br>  All in all, probably about $3,500, this is only my view, and as i have not seen teh horse, i can not give an accurate account, but this would be a realistic price.<br>  <br>  I would also suggest reasearching its breedin=g if registered, and look up in horse sale magazines, Horsedeals or anything like this, a horse that is similar to yours miht be selling for $3000, or might be selling for $6000, it depends on the market and availabily of food and location.|`|AA10904405	It really depends on where in the country you are located.  Horses in California are more expensive than horses in Kansas, as is everything.  Was he shown at local shows, or 'A' rated shows?  Go on-line to equine.com, dreamhorse.com, or others, and see what horses in your area and with similar training are being priced at.<br>  <br>  Be aware that the entire horse market country-wide is currently very slow.|`|BfNIyjIHaa	Well, it mostly depends on if he is good or bad in shows, like does he get placed first a lot, or not placed at all. Good show horses are usually a little lower than the price you have right now. Maybe try $4000 if nobody buys it after a couple of weeks. Then, try $2500 after a couple more weeks. $2500 is really the lowest you should price him. Good luck finding a good owner!|`|Sq9ppkRXaa	I dont know! Could i get him for like $400? haha lol! I love horses though! WHy are u trying to sell her! My email is open tell me why!|`|iMKuRBOtaa	It deppends on his breed,and how many shows he has been to,and what he placed in them,and what kind of shows.|`|lOGs0kIHaa	Well...if he has show experience then around 2000-2500.
f3a95b4c0d5743c7290138584c5ce3f3aa	Pomeranian are a northern breed with a thick undercoat of fur.

Keep him away from the heater though.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Small dogs can get cold easily so you could get a little doggie sweater to put on it, but generally, if they live inside, they are fine.|`|SrSz2qToaa	He is wearing a fur coat,lol.<br>  <br>  Seriously, he has fur and if he is inside, and your home is heated he is fine. His own bed and blankets are even better. I wouldnt let him sleep in front of the heater he is just fine in your room with his bed. :)|`|Z62kjUAeaa	no its not safe for any pet to sleep in front of the heater there is a chance he could get burned, especially portable ones. His skin could also become dry.  How severe is the weather?  You can buy jackets/sweaters and booties for him at the pet supply store.  Booties are a good idea because snow and ice-if you have a lot of it.  Ice can cut his feet and snow can cause frostbite.  Assuming you are in the lower hemisphere?|`|debd9c746580dbc944784f9038b27ce7aa	So are you asking if he needs clothes? He has a long coat which will keep him very warm in his little doggy bed. You don't need to give him anything else. I wouldn't let him sleep in front of the heater as he can easily burn himself while he's asleep. You can get warm puppy pads at almost any pet store or just use a warm, hot water bottle and wrap that inside a towel or tea towel.|`|wgDzrvZCaa	your doing everything right except the heater

5eKliPmeaa	She's been through an ordeal, and maybe lost lots of blood, so she is probably exhausted!  Give her a day or two of eating and drinking normally to regain some strength.  Ask your vet what the side effects of the medication are, and what to watch for that would be concerning.   <br>  If you have a crate, you could put one or the other dog in it.  The silky may appreciate having quiet time away from the maltese, and if she seems to be overdoing it, you may have to force that confinement.  It depends on whether your silky is dominant enough to tell the maltese when she's had enough.|`|3mhy3f4raa	i think she is just tired but after a week or something she should be better if not than I'm not sure. you could talk to your vet.|`|Non0u2Tyaa	This is normal for a dog who has come back from the vet.  Dont be worried if she is not as active, she just needs rest is all.  Maybe try confining her to a room which is not accessible to your other dog for just a few days, for her to relax and get her rest.  Your other dog does not understand what she is going through.
ydshiNrKaa	It probably is gnats and maybe flies.  They make a dog spray especially for keeping flies, gnats and mosquitoes off of them while outside.  I got mine at Petsmart but any pet supply store should carry it.

8accb9ae01507e9d4e1ed55a7caec396aa	Get some Nature's Miracle or Simple Solution.

More than your dog.  I hope you did not harm your dog over this.  They throw up sometimes.<br>  <br>  Well Baby your Mom should understand.  Don't hide it from her.  Dogs do that.  I am sure when you were a kid you threw up too.  Kids do that.  Resolve works really well.  If it really comes down to it you can get a carpet cleaner and clean it that way.  I have two dogs.  They destroy.  That is part of having a dog.  Your Mom should understand.  Let her help you clean it.|`|qME29XhXaa	i have two poms so i'm use to them having accidents, you could try really strong stain remover, or bleach, but not to much bleach cause it will eat through your carpet (make sure you wash the bleach out good & let it dry before you let your dog around it! Good luck) :)|`|dLsFdvFMaa	You can try using strong stain remover. Or wash it. If it is really bad, try calling a expert that can wash it off. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|eajWrslQaa	If it just happened, try soaking it up with a dry towel. NEVER smudge it or whipe it, it will just spread. Try using baking soda or laundry soap (the powdery kind, not wet). Squirt it with hot water, and it will hopefully come up. If that doesn't work, your mom might know what to do. Why would she kill you if it was your dog who threw up? She may be mad, but you can buy steamers or carpet shampooers at the store that can get it up, and they can help with future stains, too.|`|f3azIGajaa	Don't buy those expensive natural pet stain cleaners at petshops. I've found that they don't work all that great and there are some wonderful cheaper products that work better. I like using the resolve carpet stain remover. The kind that foams works really well. I let it sit for about 10 minnutes then I wipe it with a wet rag. Sometimes if the stain is really bad it helps to repeat the process a few times. Don't let the carpet dry until you've gotten the stain out. It makes it much harder to do. Hope I helped some. Good luck
FhdyUQwGaa	that's a broken coat. Smooth coats are smooth (short haired) all over) Wires, or rough coats are very hairy. Broken coats have mostly smooth coats with roughish areas.

bb8aef97fd43d53b00325617e3c3a030aa	bonjour, <br>  <br>  je pense que ton marechal est dans le juste, "enfin j'espere", effectivement si ta jument est entrain de developper un absces, il faut que tu attende qu'il murisse pour pouvoir le crever, il faut en general 3 à 4 jours, mais si tu veux faire murir l'abscés assez vite ,il y a un truc, c'est la botte de son , je m'explique , tu achete du son , tu le melange avec de l'eau chaude , et avec un sac plastique tu mets le tout dedans , et tu mets le pied de ta jument dans le sac, tu referme avec du sparadra assez costaud , tu en mets une bonne dose la ou le pied va toucher le sol, pour eviter que le sac se dechire trop facilement, en faisant cela pendant un ou deux jours ,tu change la botte de son au moins deux fois par jour, le son chaud va permettre a l'abscés de murir beaucoup plus vite, ensuite tu rapelle ton marechal qui te crevera l'abscés, en ce qui concerne les anti-inflamatoires je te dirai que je ne suis pas pour, tout simplement parce que c'est vrai que c'est pas cool de voir son cheval souffrir, mais n'oublie pas qu'avec les anti-inflamatoires il ne sentira aucune douleur et qu'il pourra peu etre attraper plus facilement des complications que s'il avait mal et qu'il faisait attention ou il met les pieds, ensuite il faut aussi penser a la fourbure ou a la maladie naviculaire, mais ont n'en est pas la , je te laise le lien de mon blog, va sur la colonne de gauche , article , "les boiteries"...|`|FVgWqroHaa	une bleime. Si ce n est pas un abces ?a peut etre ?a. Mon cheval s est mis a boité d un anterieur. Pied pas chaud au debut, puis chaud, puis pas chaud. Sensibilité en pince en reponse au test de la pince. On a pensé a un abces mais ce genre de truc perce au bout d une semaine a une semaine et demi et rien ne venait. Il a cessé de boiter 2 semaines parce qu on a supprimé le contact entre le fer et sa pince et puis  s est remis a boité, engorgé pied chaud. Veto: c est des bleime, des poches de sang coagulé. ?a peut emttre bcp de temps a guerir, soit ?a perce comme une abces soit ?a se resorbe tt seul mais ?a prend plusieurs mois. Une ferrure special (plastique entre le fer et le pied mais juste sous le fer, pas sous tt le pied) permet de le monter et de le travailler, de le soulager de la pression dans son pied.<br>  Mets lui le pied dans de la graines de lin pour ramolir la corne. Si c est un abces ?a aidera a le faire murir, si c est une bleime ?a ramolira la corne et fera baisser la pression dans le pied.<br>  <br>  Ca peut peut etre etre une maladie naviculaire, fais le test de la planche pour etre sure.|`|WK79B2Fwaa	Si la boiterie persiste je te conseille d'aller voir dans un premier temps le véto en effet, si pas de résultat, tu peux appeler un ostéopathe équin, apparemment, c'est très efficace.... Mais s'il s'agit d'un abcès le véto s'en chargera très bien... Bon Courage je suis s?re que ton cheval ira mieux car tu as l'air d'y tenir beaucoup...|`|d120daceb245ba368d532bacf96be4e9aa	A ta place je continue son traitement et si je voit qu'il n'y a pas d'évolution, je ne m'aventurais pas a laisser ma jument comme ?a sans aller chez le vétérinaire. <br>  comme dit le dicton : pas de  pieds pas de cheval.<br>  <br>  même si cela co?te cher, la vie de ton cheval doit en valoir le prix!!!|`|1415e1adea97012d46504c8a9c69bd97aa	Sachant qu'on ne peut pas te dire comme cela sans voir ton cheval, malgré la grande précision de ta question, je ne dirai qu'une seule chose suis les instructions de ton marechal ferrant et sinon, si tu as des craintes ou des doutes Véto, véto, véto !!!<br>  Vraiment, c'est important ! Ce serait dommage que tu fasses une "fausse manoeuvre" en suivant des conseils, certes partants d'une bonne intention, mais malheureusement inadaptés !<br>  <br>  bonne chance, ca devrait se resoudre rapidement !<br>  biz|`|Byy3V61gaa	Je pense également que le son peut être une bonne solution s'il s'agit d'un abcès. Ma jument en a fait un il y a quelques temps et elle souffrait tellement qu'elle en tremblait ! Comme je ne voyais rien appara?tre, je lui ai fait des cataplasmes d'argile en me disant que ?a pouvait la calmer si elle avait une inflammation.<br>  Dans tous les cas je n'aime pas non plus donner des anti inflammatoires trop rapidement car après on ne voit plus où se situe le problème.|`|fzq1PrVCaa	Bonjour: si abcès se confirme et si tu as un très bon maréchal: faut percer: ?a soulage bcp plus vite que d'attendre la maturité: il souffre pdt ce temps la.J'ai eu par 2 fois des chevaux avec pb pied: 1er cas: (je débutais) un maréchal(!!) m'encloue ma jument, je fais venir un autre:il a percé immédiatement l'abcès(soins ensuite)le 2è: j'achète un cheval qui boite(et oui ?a arrive)bleime: pareil: mon maréchal(le meme depuis) a repercé plus fort ce qui avait été fait par un véto!(soins ensuite), je dis: avis véto, mais : soulagement maréchal.Arghhhff nos dadas qu'on aime!|`|d438bceecfcfb7ae09cd5f9276557d5caa	appelle le véto... <br>  sinon elle fait pas de fourbure ? Pas de problemes osseux ? <br>  a priori ?a ressemble à un abces, tu lui a donné un anti inflammatoire ou un anti infectieux ?|`|ff01fb9d8e3a32be50cbfe97d19ad2f1aa	Si il y a chaleur , c qu'il y a inflammation. Le maréchal n'a pas repéré une atteinte sur le pied?quoiqu'il en soit, repos, sur une litière ultra propre. Peut etre que c rien du tout, mais je te conseille malgré tout d'appeler ton véto tout de suite, c lui le professionnel de santé. Il ne faut pas laisser s'installer une boiterie, parce que ?a a des conséquences sur le dos (bah oui, qui dit boiterie antérieure dit compensation avec l'épaule
OkagK1sDaa	Look, you don't have to have the name brands if you are on a budget! You don;t need name brands at all! Go to Wal-Mart, the Dollar Store, or any other general store. <br>  <br>  But, sometimes,  a better quality, name brand collar, will most likely last way longer than an off-brand collar. Try Pet Co. or Vet Med Direct. Also www.kvvet.com has some good stuff. <br>  <br>  I recommend using Lupine collars and leashes, they can be a bit pricey, but it is a lifetime guarentee, even if chewed! That means, if anything on the leash or collar brakes, you can send it back free, and it get a new one FREE!!! I have one, they have really cute styles too!Lupine is at the Kv vet website<br>  <br>   Dog beds can be anything. A blanket or an old pillow, a fuzzy rug, your bed! They can be found pretty cheap on sale. Try signing up for sale emails for several pet stores, usually they have pretty good sales.<br>  <br>   As for treats, training treats anyway, just cut up some genaric hotdogs into itty-bitty bits, especially for Chihuahua!<br>  <br>   Hope I helped!|`|lu9FVC1Zaa	I do alot of shoping at Petsmart-online.|`|437c1f4f17c55610b255a3cf79c146cbaa	petco or petsmart i like petsmart|`|0bd75c85ad128e3c1dec52c93f960215aa	You can go to Family Dollar, they have collars for about 2.00 and food bowls for 1.00, its not a "Pet Store" but they have a Pet Isle. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|95ol7Ls8aa	Sometimes petco and petsmart have good deals, but a lot of times they're overpriced.  Check the pet areas in local department stores like Walmart, Kmart, etc.  They have all those essentials there.  Or you could always look on ebay.  They have tons of things there, and it's not all used, either.  A lot of it is brand new and selling for cheaper.  Overstock.com has some pet things for inexpensive too, sometimes.  And shipping there is always super cheap.  Good luck!|`|POJ4vmZlaa	it depends where you live but go to petco|`|b872e6109d83901f6b21430160dcadcaaa	I also like petsmart.

f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	How come you decided to go w/ the Purina? Did you look at the ingredient listing?? I wouldn't let my dogs look at or smell the bag, let alone eat that garbage...<br>  CORN WHEAT.. First two ingredients.. And it gets no better.. You have that birth defect causing Synthetic K down there in the bottom.. Cancer causing dyes.. Animal fat.. Not even enough sense to have an particular animal listed, so they can change the ingredients according to what's cheapest that batch.. You might just as well take your doggie to Wendy's for a burger, would be more nutritious and safer to feed.. This food is GARBAGE! Seriously garbage food.. It shouldn't even be on the shelf.. I wrote Purina and was discussing their foods with them, when I questioned them on their birth defect causing synthetic K.. They suddenly stopped talking to me and refuse to answer.. Vet admitted to me that it causes birth defects.. That's just a small part of the problem with this food.. No offense, cause most people don't know much about foods.. Vets don't know much about foods, or just plain don't care, and tell people ' yeah it's wonderful ' just so that they don't have to explain the ingredients an the harm they do, the chronic problems that they cause to your pet.. It's to his benefit that you feed garbage.. Not your pets.. Feed something good.. They eat less, they get their nutrition from less and they poop less. PLUS they are actually healthy and fit.. Your dog is very likely so fat cause he has to over eat in order to get his nutrition..<br>  <br>  LOOK...<br>  Ground yellow corn, ground whole wheat, soybean meal, corn germ meal, soybean hulls*, corn gluten meal, turkey by-product meal, chicken by-product meal, meat and bone meal, animal digest, animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), calcium carbonate, salt, added color (Red 40, Yellow 5, Blue 2), zinc sulfate, Vitamin E supplement, zinc proteinate, ferrous sulfate, choline chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, brewers dried yeast, manganese sulfate, manganese proteinate, niacin, Vitamin A supplement, copper sulfate, calcium pantothenate, copper proteinate, garlic oil, pyridoxine hydrochloride, Vitamin B-12 supplement, thiamine mononitrate, Vitamin D-3 supplement, riboflavin supplement, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), folic acid, biotin, sodium selenite.|`|bUtl3fDkaa	I would avoid the Purina Fit & Trim.  It's mainly fillers.  Here are the first 10 ingredients:<br>  Ground yellow corn, ground whole wheat, soybean meal, corn germ meal, soybean hulls, corn gluten meal, turkey by-product meal, chicken by-product meal, meat and bone meal, animal digest<br>  <br>  Bluntly, it's junk. It's mostly fillers.<br>  <br>  Read the ingredients on the food you buy. Go with a high quality dog food. (Or in your case, the puppy variety of the brand you choose, since your dog is still a puppy.) A grain should not be in the first couple ingredients ingredient (corn and such are mainly fillers, dogs don't digest it well).  Avoid foods that have a lot of "by products" listed.<br>  <br>  Here is an article about byproducts:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=ingrd" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  And an article on what ingredients to avoid:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Some GOOD foods are :<br>  * Merrick - <a href="http://www.merrickpetcare.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.merrickpetcare.com/</a><br>  * Solid Gold - <a href="http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.solidgoldhealth.com/</a><br>  * Canidae - <a href="http://www.canidae.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.canidae.com/</a><br>  * Timberwolf - <a href="http://timberwolforganics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://timberwolforganics.com/</a><br>  * Orijen - <a href="http://www.championpetfoods.com/orijen/orijen/" rel="nofollow">http://www.championpetfoods.com/orijen/o...</a><br>  * Wellness - <a href="http://www.omhpet.com/wellness/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omhpet.com/wellness/</a><br>  * Chicken Soup brand - <a href="http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssoul.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chickensoupforthepetloverssou...</a><br>  * Innova - <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/brands/innova.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/brands/innova.a...</a><br>  * Innova EVO - <a href="http://www.naturapet.com/brands/evo.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturapet.com/brands/evo.asp</a><br>  <br>  Or check this website for good foods: <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  (I recommend only feeding foods rated 4, 5, or 6 stars. Anything 3 stars or less, I would stay away from.)<br>  <br>  Here are a couple WEIGHT MANAGEMENT varieties of the foods mentioned above as well:<br>  *  Canidae Platinum - <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/showproduct.php?product=513&cat=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  * Wellness Weight Management - <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/showproduct.php?product=331&cat=4" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  There's a good chance, though, if you switch to a high-quality dog food and feed in measured amounts, you probably won't even need the weight management varieties.  Getting proper exercise is still essential though.<br>  <br>  If I were you, I'd skip the green beans, especially if you're going to boil them.  No nutritional value at all.  And if they're canned instead of fresh, they will be very high in sodium.  Instead, I would recommend trading in any "treats" for slices of fresh carrot.  Dogs love the crunch of carrots and it won't be fattening like most regular dog treats are.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Stay away from grocery stores brands.  They are low-quality foods chalk full of fillers, preservatives, dyes, etc.. (Grocery store foods are those like Beneful, Old Roy, Alpo, etc.)<br>  <br>  Beware "premium" foods. "Premium" does not mean good nutritionally, and is not a nutritionally high quality food. It has the same types of ingredients as grocery store foods, just a bit better quality of those not-so-good ingredients. (Premium foods are those like Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, etc..)<br>  <br>  Another thing to be wary of: A lot of vets will recommend what they sell in their office. They get profit from the brands they keep on their shelves, that's why they push it. Truth is, vet schools don't focus a lot on nutrition. It's not saying that a vet is a bad vet because he recommends those foods, a lot of vets just are told "this is good food", so they pass the message along without proper nutrition knowledge. Also, some dog food brands (like Hills) support vet schools, so vets have heard of it from the time they start college, which makes them think it's good as well.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  When switching foods, do it gradually.  I do this over about a two week timespan:<br>  25% food A, 75% food B<br>  50% food A, 50% food B<br>  75% food A, 25% food B<br>  100% food A|`|ZgooR22Paa	When we have a dog that is overweight at the clinic, we reduce food by half...so you might want to cut back even more.  You should see at least a 2-3 lb drop in the first month.  Most vets will let you weigh in for free, so I would do that.<br>  <br>  Thank you for being responsible and not letting your dog remain fat!  You are helping to prevent diabetes, joint problems, and liver problems!  You are also adding at LEAST 3 years to your dog's life (according to a recent study).  Keep up the good work!|`|br5hFybeaa	This is just my opinion.  Our dog was gaining alot of weight, and all we had to do was cut down on his food, and increase his exercise.<br>  You didn't mention what kind of dog you have.  Ours is a medium size, 50 pound, mix breed.  (All American Mutt)  He gets two cups of dry food per day, as our vet directed.  <br>  The key to exercise is consistency.  I can't emphasisze that enough.  If you walk him/her everday, even if it's only one mile, doing it everyday, instead of two walks of two miles a week, you'll see your pup shed the weight quickly.  Walking more frequently also gets your pup used to the leash, helps socialize your pup, and helps in many more ways besides just his weight.|`|cE1bf6nIaa	I agree with abbyful. I recommend Canidae or Solid Gold. I agree with her about the green beans & the carrots & gradually switching brands. 1 cup am & 1 cup pm

7KCvsqpCaa	My mini gelding got his leg stuck in a fence when he was younger and the vet gave him Bute for the swelling. Bute is an anti- inflamatory drug. She said he might get arthritis in the leg and if he limped or it swelled to give him Bute, but luckily he recovered with no limp. You should have him checked over by a vet again just to make sure he doesn't have anything that the other vet overlooked. Also talk to the vet about using Bute for the swelling and the dosage. I think Bute is one of those medications your not supposed to use everyday because it does something bad to their stomach. Maybe the vet will have another medication that's cheap like Bute with no ill side effects. Also talk to the vet about how the swelling will effect his ability to bend his leg for a farrier. You definetly don't want him to get laminitis. Hope this helps!|`|C1eaHtOjaa	Get a second opinion, You need to find out what the swelling is. <br>  If there is no pain or heat, it is doubtful that Bute will help and the possible resulting liver damage if treatment has to be long term, is a problem.<br>  You should try to get something done about it, as swelling around any joint may cause problems with lameness, handling for you, the farrier and vet.<br>  I have seen a really successful result on a Thoroughbred mare, who had a large fluid swelling on a hind leg. the vet had given up and written her off as incurable. Her owners had her treated by a Homeopath, (who was also a conventional Vet)<br>  So if you have no luck with your Vet this may be something to try.<br>  Good Luck

OlwJY0pKaa	People all over the country have full-time jobs and have pets.<br>  <br>  Unless you were one of the lucky few to win the lottery or if your parents still pay your bills, how else do you expect them to pay for a pets' needs?<br>  <br>  Is this supposed to be satirical?|`|lUwuVgiWaa	I think that's fine, most people have to leave their dogs while they work and since he walks the dog twice a day he seems to be doing just fine with her.<br>  <br>  As long as the dog isnt having a fit when he leaves or destroying things while he's gone she's probably just hanging out sleeping all day like most dogs. <br>  <br>  It's nice you want the dog to be happy but I really think she's ok.  Some people dont even take the time to walk their dogs twice a day and you cant get too angry because people have to work sometime!|`|a9b60a23a536072227e4bd7354624323aa	You should tell him that dogs need more attention than other animals. Tell him to get a cat instead. Find a nice home for the dog where he will get attention like he needs. Unfortunately, some people see animals as property and not as living, breathing, things that depend on their owners for food, attention, care and companionship. Dogs are pack animals, they don't like to be alone.<br>  Good Luck getting through to him.|`|c21a17144312842cdd56a17614becaf0aa	As long as the dog is loved,veted,walked, and cared for, the dog is fine, He is not tearing up the place or barking all the time it seems he is most content. I run a small rescue and I screen people before placing one of my rescues, and I wish there were more folks that work for a living and don't tie a dog up or abuse there dog etc etc... He is OK so don;t worry. He sounds like he has a good home. It could be a hell of allot worse.|`|l4oQPixiaa	well wait a min here, is he is looking after the dog? is he feeding the dog, walking the dog, paying vets bills for the dog? <br>  Id rather see someone keep a dog like this than see it out on the street or with abusive owners.|`|urY8utgjaa	10am to 5pm is certainly not an excessive amount of time for a dog to be alone. And a walk before and after work is actually more than what a LOT of pet owners offer their pooches. I think it sounds as though he's pretty responsible with his dog.
CBNC40sDaa	God bless Karen Carpenter.  She had a beautiful voice.|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	I don't know, but I'm starting to worry, because they're vultures.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	There is a symbolic meaning for birds that are flying over you.  For example, blackbirds are symbolic of omens and mysticism.  This means good and bad things will come in your future.  Bluebirds are a symbol of happiness and fullfillment.  They are a reminder your world is filled with happiness and satisfaction.  The crow is symbolic of intelligence, watchfulness, and past life connections.  They are telling us to be aware of our surroundings and keep an eye out for trouble.|`|a05jCTBRaa	Well, in my best educated guess. It's probably because (just like me) they long to be close to you.|`|ifdNUvwbaa	Birds are probably hungry so they think that humans will feed them. The other answers are about the song; so I am not sure what you mean.|`|BduyW72taa	because, other than wanting to be close to you, as karen capenter said, they might be attracted to the bird seed i put in you hood :P|`|MDWaPmXsaa	They love me.  What can I say?  Now if I could just get that darn ivory billed woodpecker to show up, I'd have it made.|`|enC9TvxUaa	-In my case, it's because my tiel and too both want my attention when I am home.|`|f6OOxJQsaa	Just like me, I want to be close to you.
iIGOi2Idaa	I think they grow about the same speed as ours, so what, a millimetre a week? It's hard to tell because they get worn down of course. Older cats who don't go outside and can't groom much can get their claws growing into their pads within about 4 months.    Chalice|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I have no idea how fast they grow - I trim them once a week or at least once every 2 weeks.|`|0WASp0bHaa	I trim my cats' claws about every two weeks|`|TiAK1629aa	Really old cats claws don't grow very quickly at all.  I trim my 16 yr olds claws about once a month, my younger cats, I trim them about every other week.  I've never measured, but I'd say they grow around 1/8 inches per week.  That's a guess though based on what I trim.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Yeah, I find that I need to trim every other week or so.  The way claws grow isn't like our fingernails.  It's sort of like a new claw grows underneath the old one, and eventually the old one comes off - you'll find the hollowed out claws on your carpet once they fall off.  It's kind of like how snakes or crabs will shed their outer shell revealing a brand new one underneath.|`|76aKunZHaa	Cats claws can grow just a little bit in a week .
iVQULHqYaa	My b1itch who is now ten years old started peeing in her sleep, I think that this was over a year ago. I took her to the vets on the day that this began, however I dropped a urine sample off at the vets two hours before her appointment. I did this to ensure that the results would be available when I took her.    The vet said that this was age related incontinence and that there was no infection. She continued to urinate in her bed on the odd occasion and there was no smell, however she only did this in the beds that she curls up in, then she stopped. I could not understand this.I thought about this and realised that she had stopped after I changed her arthritis medication and the new meds contained Turmeric. I looked Turmeric up and discovered that it helps with urinary problems.    You must take your dog to the vets. If it is incontinence there are tablets to stop this and they must be given every day.He could simply have an infection and the vet will sort this out.    As for the sulphur smelling farts, I would consider changing him onto a grain free dog food. Any change must be gradual, you must add a small % of the new food with the old and increase the % of the new every day. Do this over two weeks to avoid an upset tummy.|`|DY8YYluqaa	probably just slobber then|`|udP6fJ6maa	GROSS... You should ask your vet. it does not sound like anything serious|`|DTBbQbfLaa	*hack*  gross dude...|`|02Rrrz47aa	hmm...it seems almost like discharge|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	He's probably been licking himself.  That generally has kind of a nasty smell and makes their beds wet.  I doubt it is anything serious.  If it actually is urine, he probably has a bladder infection, since dogs don't generally pee in their own beds.|`|YZ4ozLyyaa	um ew|`|hlino21Qaa	besides being really gross, it could be anal leakage. Put a black light / UV light over the area to get a good look at the damaged sheet. Try adjusting his diet. If that doesnt work take him to a Vet.|`|AA10988479	if he's had a loose tum recently then maybe his anal glands need attention - he'd probably be cleaning his bum leaving the wet patch and it would have a fishy odour.  if you're brave, check his bum area - blocked anal glands can become infected if left.    That said, mine often leave a wet patch in their beds where they've been cleaning themselves, perfectly normal.  and one of my dogs lets the stinkiest farts out - he's fed the same as my other dog but must just digest it differently - bit like humans I guess.

DN9MkwQgaa	My dog does this when he gets too excited.  Rubbing the underside of his neck seems to help.|`|AyKvmIr2aa	this is a definate emergency.

My vet said it happens when they get a tickle in their throat (allergies, perhaps?).  Sometimes it happens when they pull on the leash too hard.  For my dogs, very gentle massage of the throat helps to clear it right up.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|8zf5TcCRaa	wow people.....cover their nose with your hand.  they will probably move their head around to get away but just move with them.  they will stop in like 5 seconds.  it really is ROCKET SCIENCE|`|AZShCSHnaa	calm down! my teacher's dog has done this before. just give her some time and comfort her she is just gagging on something.|`|ppVPu0Zvaa	My dog, Buster, did this a long time ago. He did it for several days. I took him to the vet, and he stopped his gagging/hiccup thing. If your dog does it for a week, take her to the vet. Also, check your dog's toys. If any of them are chewed, or pieces are missing that weren't before, see your vet ASAP. Your dog may have a piece stuck in her mouth. And check the house. Look for any chewed items. Your dog may have swallowed something. If it did, see a vet ASAP.<br>  Hope I helped! :)|`|x15aioZOaa	I agree w/Amber my vet calls it a reverse sneeze.  Your pup has a tickle in it's nose.  If it becomes too annoying, take  it to vet., may have alergies.
w5LF3Z0uaa	Il y a des chats qui aiment l'eau et d'autres pas, c'est comme nous finalement... j'ai déjà vu des chats qui buvaient au robinet.. Moi la mienne maintenant a 9 ans et donc elle n'est plus comme ?a... mais quand elle était jeune, elle me suivait partout, dormait dans le bidet... donc tu vois...<br>  <br>  pour les plantes, tu met un peu de citronelle que tu achète en pharmacie sur la terre, ton chat n'y reviendra pas, car il n'aimera pas l'odeur.... pour l'autorité, un chat n'obéit pas beaucoup, ?a n'est pas un chien.... <br>  <br>  Il a peut-être un peu plus peur de ton chéri que de toi et c'est pour ?a qu'il se méfie...<br>  <br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est de le faire dormir dans ton lit, c'est une très mauvaise idée... un chat ne doit pas dormir dans le lit de quelqu'un c'est pas hygiènique du tout... il va dans sa litière et ensuite il vient dans ton lit....  Bref tu fais ce que tu veux mais où tu l'acceptes, ou tu ne l'acceptes pas mais prends une décision car sinon ton chat ne comprendra rien....<br>  <br>  Pour le jardin, s'il s'enfuit tant pis, que veux tu... mon chat n'a jamais voulu aller dans le jardin même quand les portes étaient ouvertes... j'en ai eu qui partaient toute la journée et qui ne revenaient que le soir... Une chose: évite de lui faire passer la nuit dehors car ils ont tendance à se faire écraser la nuit par les voitures....|`|krtTV4LLaa	Bonjour,<br>  <br>  J'ai deux tites minettes, et elles adorentla baignoire et les toilettes. Elles jouent avec l'eau ou picolent alors qu'elles ont toujours de l'eau fraiche dans un bol à coté des croquettes. Elles boivent aussi l'eau des toilettes des que j'oublie de les fermer. Elles sont tombés plusieurs fois dans mon bain sans trop avoir l'air choquée. Je crois donc que tous les chats ne detestent pas l'eau, tout simplement !<br>  <br>  Pour l'autorité : ne te laisse vraiment pas faire !! Grosse minette n'était pas du tout craintive quand elle était petite ce qui fait que lorsqu'elles e mordaient, rien ne lui faisait peur, surtout pas mes NON. Aujourd'hui elle a un caractère pourrie (je l'aime qd même ma grosse loute) et est très dominante.<br>  Avec la petite, j'ai tout de suite mis les points sur les I, la seule technique c'est qu'il te craigne un minimim. Donc quand il te fait mal, fais lui un peu mal aussi : tiens le par le cou, et mordille lui le nez (c'est un conseil du véto, leurs mamans font ca) Il respecte visiblement plus ton ami...<br>  <br>  En ccl, il faut vraiment montrer ue c'est toi le chef, comme le fait ton homme ! Il a son ptit caractère le sting ;)|`|8af297f2db1d36020599480c1efd7d79aa	désolé de te l'apprendre mais ton chat est un chien....qui a trouvé un maitre!|`|apAkZ7vsaa	Ne t'inquiète pas, il est tout petit. il s'est trouvé une maison ou il se sent bien. S'il miaule quand tu prends ta douche, c'est normal, c'est un bébé et tu es devenu sa "maman" .Par rapport à ton homme, c'est typique, il doit le craindre et quand il part, il est heureux parceque il t'a tout pour lui. Sur le fait qu'il fasse ses griffes, tu trouveras dans des magasins spécialisés, des "tapis" fait pour eux que tu peux disposer dans certains endroits stratégiques, il est petit mais tu verras ?à marche   <br>  j'adore le nom que tu lui as trouvé!!   biz|`|mnkfVsaEaa	Où est le problème ?<br>  J'ai eu un chat qui nageait dans la baignoire. Attention à la chaleur de l'eau!|`|xC3BJHW9aa	à cette age ils sont tous un peu fou,fou!!! ;o)|`|LAZRQ86uaa	Mon chaton qui a 4 mois adre aussi venir quand je prends un bain, il joue avec la mousse et souvent saute dans l'eau, ?a ne le dérange pas mais il n'y reste pas longtemps Il traverse la baignoire puis revmonte sur le bord, puis un coup de serviette et de sèche cheveux ( il ne dit rien non plus )<br>  <br>  L'autre chat, lui, vient toujours quand on se lave les dents et il adore boire au robinet !<br>  <br>  Pour ce qui est du lit, il a peut-être peur de ton homme ( étant donné qu'apparement il lui obéit plus quand il dit "non")<br>  Pour ma part, les miens montent se coucher généralement en même temps que nous. Baloo lui préfère dormir au pieds du lit alors qhe Chester, le chaton, dort plus souvent sous la couette bien au chaud après avoir fait un énorme calin et plein de ronrons|`|XqXMJyi6aa	Bonjour, je ne sais pas si ?a va te rassurer mais Sphinx (3 mois 1/2) ressemble beaucoup à ton chenapan! D'abord il aime l'eau, il ne peut pas s'empêcher de mettre les pattes dans la baignoire jusqu'aux "coudes" et après il passe un temps infini à se lécher pour à nouveau replonger........ Ensuite (et c'est le ponpon) mon mari (n'avait jamais eu de chat) n'a qu'à parler pour que m?sieur obéisse (presque tout le temps ne pas oublier que c'est un chat) alors que je peux bien couiner ce que je peux, il s'en contre fiche! Je me suis toujours faite obéir de mes chats, sauf celui-là! Pour les sorties, je le mets en laisse jusqu'à ce qu'il soit castré surtout que mon gros kiwi (5 kgs de graisse) n'a qu'une envie c'est de lui montrer tous ses endroits préférés donc c'est non! Trop dangereux, je viens de perdre Twist et ?a me suffit largement...........|`|a7ef7e0a0bffb734889c26584f93bb86aa	Bonjour<br>  <br>  Je ne me sens pas trés étonné d'apprendre que ce sacré Sting n'a pas peur de la salle de bains : il voit bien que tu y vas régulièrement en le laissant. Comme il ne te sent pas stresser, et qu'il te considère comme sa mère adoptive, il ne voit pas de raisons de stresser.  Les baignoires sont souvent trés appréciées des chats, ils aiment y jouer au toboggan. <br>  <br>  Pour l'autorité : si Mr Sting mord, attrape le par la peau du cou, secoue le un peu en faisant la grosse voix, puis mets le au coin quelques minutes. Tu peux l'attraper en portant des moufles de cuisine. Cependant, il assimile clairement ton homme à l'autorité, c'est trés manifeste ...<br>  <br>  Pour les sorties : ne t'inquiète pas. Comme je l'ai souvent expliqué, les chats explorent les alentours de leur maison par progression concentrique à partir de l'entrée de leur maison. Tu peux, lors des premières sorties, accompagner Sting, afin de mettre en déroute un éventuel animal intrus.<br>  <br>  Il se précipite vite à tes pieds d'une part parce qu'il est habitué à vivre au chaud, dans un appart douillet, et d'autre part parce qu'il se sent encore bien petit. Pour lui, une simple sortie dans le jardin est épuisante et trés excitante, mais aussi trés effrayante. Il est donc tout à fait normal qu'il revienne vite vers toi. Si toutefois il réclame de nouveau à sortir, c'est qu'il a trouvé l'expérience excitante.|`|vNG511khaa	Ton chat ressemble beaucoup au mien...en plus dissipé car plus jeune!! Il aime l'eau, c'est tout! Le mien est pareil, dis toi qu'il est bien mieux comme ?a plein de vie, et mets lui des limites bien claires, sans céder! Quand afro "joue" un peu trop fort, je lui fais comprendre en insérant un doigt entre ses coussinets, et je lui dis "attention les patounes!", et elle a compris qu'il faut rentrer ses griffes parce que ?a fait mal! Trouve toi aussi un moyen de faire comprendre àton chat quand il dépasse les bornes! Et il se calmera avec l'age!

NosXQLYYaa	Qué interesante, un gato que come tomates, mira los tomates son ácidos, es casi impensable que sean del agrado de un gato, aunque una de mis gatas come naranja igual de rarísimo, esto me hace pensar que tú gato quizá esté falto de algún nutriente, el tomate es rico en betacarotenos, LIcopeno, vitamina C, es remineralizante, desintoxicante, combate infecciones, fortalece el sistema inmune, bueno un sinfín de beneficios, los animales son inteligentes si algo les falta o algo les duele ellos buscan la manera de compensarlo, Hipócrates ya decía "Qué los alimentos sean tú medicina", principio básico de la medicina ortomolecular, no te aburro más, seguramente tú gato come tomates por que o bien algo tiene mal, o bien algún nutriente le falta, indaga en ello, por eso prueba con cualquier verdura o fruta seguro que el encuentra el sustituto perfecto, vé probando él mismo te dirá cual prefiere,  de composición similar al tomate es la Toronja, el chile, pero el chile me parece fuerte para dárselo, ja,ja, mejor prueba la toronja y prueba la zanahoria, si los acepta sin dua es que busca betacarotenos y licopeno y vitamina C, si no los acepta entonces simplemente es que le gusta su sabor entonces prueba con otros hasta ver cual es de su preferencia, espero haberte ayudado.<br>  Pd: de todos modos averigua si es que está falto de minerales como potasio quizá por eso toma tomate , o falto de vitaminas, e investiga su causa, ?qué tal una analítica de sangre?, bueno es mi opinión nada más, saludos.|`|6AJA2c3uaa	El problema es que los alimentos saben y tienen olores diferentes.

Dans ton cas, c'est un peu plus délicat mais pas impossible. Par contre, lorsque tu ramèneras ton chiot à la maison surveille bien que tes chats ne le griffent pas. Petit à petit, ils s'habitueront à la présence de ce nouveau résident.|`|Fa6EzVqtaa	Un chien même adulte et bien éduqué ne course pas un chat ! Donc s'ils'agit d'un chiot encore moins toutefois il faut l'habituer doucement le mettre en contact avec mais sans exigences (voir aussi la réaction des chats ont-ils l'habitude de voir des chiens surtout à la campagne, celà ne devrait pas poser problèmes. Il faut respecter le territoire de chacun et ne pas s'interposer de trop tout en surveillant les réactions de chacun. De toute fa?on un chiot ira par curiosité et non pour courser; le chat lui montrera assez vite jusqu'ou il peut aller et s'il re?oit un petit coup de griffe il hésitera à retourner embêter mais avec le temps ils deviendront les meilleurs amis du monde et joueront ensembles. Par contre le prendre à l'essai je suis contre c'est un être vivant qui ressent aussi des sentiments vis à vis de son ma?tre alors pourquoi lui infliger si petit un sentiment d'abandon celà pourrait engendrer un mauvais départ pour sa petite vie. Si j'étais encore éleveur (je l'ai été dans mon jeune age) je refuserais catégoriquement ce procédé. Avant de vous décider faites venir une personne possédant un chien adulte habitué aux chats et testez le caractère de vos félins à l'instant ou (l'intrus) pénètre dans son territoire, ensuite à vous de juger si vos chats sont assez sociables pour accepter ce bébé chien, dans le cas contraire abstenez-vous pour le bien-être de tous.|`|IDp0jithaa	Personellement, j'ai un chien et  4 chats, et tout va bien, mes chats courent apres le chien, s'amusent ensemble, tres bonne cohabitation. Le petit detail c'est que le chien etait la avant les chats ce qui n'est pe pas negligeable d'un point de vue difficullte!C'est mon  humble avis. Effectivement, prends un chiot, il sera oblige de sadapter...Bonne chance, j'espere que ta maman acceptera!!Je croise les doigts!|`|aFaF6lTyaa	Prendre un chiot à l'essaie pour voir si il s'entend avec ton matou ? Je ne pense pas qu'un éleveur te laisse prendre un chiot à l'essaie ! <br>  <br>  Personnellement je ne le ferais pas (j'élève des Bengals et des Border collies justement). <br>  <br>  Il n'est pas bon de laisser partir un animal dans ces conditions, le stress serais trop important pour le chiot dans le cas ou il devrais retourner chez l'éleveur puis être à nouveau adopter.<br>  <br>  Choisis un chiot chez un éleveur qui à des chats, ainsi le chiot sera déja habitué aux matous.<br>  <br>  Si de ton coté tes chats acceptent les chiens (demande à une connaissance de venir avec son chien, un chien habitué aux chats pour pas qu'il les courses) et voit comment les chats réagissent. <br>  <br>  Quoi qu'il en soit habitués ou pas; beaucoup de gens ont chat et chien et apres une ou deux semaines généralement ils s'acceptent sans probleme. <br>  <br>  Il est sage en tout cas de te renseigner avant ! Trop de gens réfléchissent apres ............ alors bravo à toi !<br>  <br>  Bon courage dans tes recherches, choisis bien l'éleveur. Tu va te regaler avec ton BC lors de tes promennades à cheval et ton futur chien adorera ?a !
YIP6l9Zkaa	Ne t'inquiètes pas au bout de 5 jours de l'arrivée de ce chaton, il faut un peu plus de temps pour qu'un chat en accepte un autre sur son territoire. Tu as raison de t'occuper en priorité de Kiwi, mais il faudrait que le reste de la famille le fasse aussi afin qu'il ne sente pas délaissé par l'arrivée de ce chaton.<br>  <br>  Plus embêtant par contre que ta minette ne soit toujours pas rentrée. Je suppose que tu as fait le tour du quartier en l'appelant. Continues, en remuant un paquet de croquettes, pour l'inciter à venir. As tu mis des annonces, avec sa description et sa photo dans les alentours ? As tu prévenu les vétérinaires des environs ? Souvent, les gens qui trouvent un chat s'adressent au véto du quartier pour savoir s'il y en a eu un de perdu. J'espère qu'elle n'est pas loin, et va bient?t rentrer. Dans ce cas, ne la laisses pas ressortir avant qu'elle ne soit habituée à sa nouvelle maison, et à son nouveau compagnon.<br>  <br>  PS : ai vu tes infos supplémentaires, mais ce qui m'incitait à te conseiller de continuer à chercher Twist, c'est que généralement, les chats n'aiment pas les déménagements, et il se peut qu'elle n'ait pas encore tous ses repères dans son nouvel environnement. J'espère de tout coeur que tu la retrouveras, et dans ce cas, merci de nous le dire. Je suppose que tu as déjà essayé de lui laisser de la nourriture près de ta maison ? J'ai des amis dont la chatte a fugué pendant 3 semaines parce que des invités étaient venus avec un chien, mais elle a finit par rentrer...<br>  <br>  Pour Kiwi et son futur copain, si ?a se passe mieux quand ils sont tout seuls, il faudrait que tes enfants en tiennent un peu plus compte. Expliques leur bien qu'il est important que celui ci ne soit pas malheureux, ils comprendront bien, j'en suis s?re.|`|2pEiHGHsaa	ne t'inquiète pas avec le temps il finira par l'accepter, c'est son territoire c'est normal qui comporte comme sa. courage|`|77d22d20db6be1950e02d93f79cedf80aa	J'espère que ?a va passer!

J6J1l5x2aa	I learnt alot riding while the horse was on the lunge line.<br>  <br>  For example, riding without stirrups is very good for your posture and really builds your leg muscles. It teaches you to sit up straight and feel the horse with your legs.<br>  <br>  Another thing we used to do is hold a long stick, like a broomstick (without the broom part, of course), with your hands as far apart as possible and then lifting your right hand to your back, followed by your left and then back tot the front again. Make sure you ride a really calm horse with this though, sothat it doesn't get scared by the stick. This exercise is also very good for your posture.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of for now. <br>  <br>  Of course there are many other fun things you can do on a horses back on a lunge line. it all depends on what you want to achieve. if it's just for fun and if you have a stirdy horse and a good instructor you could check out vaulting. I'm not sure if that's what your looking for but you should look it up on google (or yahoo ;)) or something because there are many sites on that around with many fun exercises.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	there are a ton of great excerises in the book "Centered riding" by Sally Swift.<br>  The majority of the book is about lunging excersises and visualization.<br>  It is really excellent and you will learn how to do downward transitions (without saddle or bridle), upward transiitons, lengthen and shorten the horses stride, and by using this book you will develop the best seat possible.  It does not matter if you ride western, dressage, jumpers or whatever....the principals of this book can be used in any discipline:)|`|53e2ec9d500a1e40c31049a6ec1b8c1baa	Apart from the usual leg, arm exercises, a really I find that lunging a rider is great for teaching a rider to use their seat and get a feel for the horse underneath them. I like this; Get the rider to shut their eyes and whilst in walk feel the movement (See if they are able to tell you the leg sequences). Another exercise is to get the rider to slow the horse with the use of their seat and back.(this works really well if you take their reins away and keep the hand in an imaginary rein position.|`|9itgfx3haa	Put a collar on then hook the lunge line to it. <br>  Next you run around in circles VERY VERY fast! <br>  you will burn fat and have fun while doing it!<br>  but make sure someone is chasing you with a whip! it helps alot when your getting tired.|`|qY5kW6Niaa	I really like putting my hands on my horses withers and riding through transitions.  It pushes my seat into a better position, and helps me to develop a good feel for the change in gait.  When I am comfortable, I then ride with my hands to the side, and/or where they would be if I were holding the reins, and I continue transitions.  riding transitions is more helpful than mindless circles because they force you to start moving with the horse and help you to really feel what he is doing.  When you get really good, if you have a horse and handler you can trust, try closing your eyes.  Just make sure you are wearing a helmet and that you can really trust your horse and your partner.

t8ZL4F6Xaa	where you can find grooming? You should be able to find a listing in the yellow pages or ask friends your vet. They do not require a special groomer. I take mine once every 4-6 weeks he could go a little longer but I like the puppy cut and i like to keep his nails cut short. My little guy is only have maltese and half yorkie love him so much he has the best personality every one tells me how calm and even tempered he is . you should also be able to find training the same way. If you are looking for a quick not expensive start at training petsmart offers a 8 week puppy class for around $100. Our puppy is 14 weeks and hasn't had any formal training but he is doing pretty good he will sit and stay. he is 90% potty trained . lol . He does how ever mind me a lot better then my husband, but then again so does my daughter. He is great with her she is 3 and I had some concerns about snapping but he doesnt sometimes he runs from her to his own special place but never snaps at her or bites her. If she falls or crys out he is the first one to her to make sure she is ok. You should be able to goggle Maltese dogs and find all the links you need. Good luck. I think as long as you use common sense you'll be fine.If he is a puppy I would start brushing his coat out even if short and brushing his teeth early on so he gets use to it . Jax will let you do any thing to him , we brush him every night and wipe his face with a clean damp towel I use doggie wipes every few days on his body to keep him smelling good but he never smells bad and we brush his teeth a few times a week. The vet told me he can have a bath once every 2 weeks but I find once a month does fine since he is an inside dog|`|3uIOlUo7aa	You need to find several responsible, knowledgeable breeders that might mentor you and teach you about the breed.  They can go to any obedience class that is offered, just make sure it is a good trainer that doesn't allow abuse of the dogs and can train you to properly train a dog.  Getting a puppy is a bit harder, if you are going to get one that isn't a poor quality one from a puppy miller or back yard greeder.  You can learn about the health and temperament issues as well as any specialized issues that the breed can have and how to best handle them -- a good breeder will do proper health testing and be breeding to improve the breed in all respects and be able to help you even if they don't have a puppy coming up so they aren't interested in making money off of you but in doing what is right for the breed.  Grooming, they can be groomed anywhere as well but YOU will need to brush them regularly, at least two or three times a week to prevent matting, if you want that lovely coat -- if you don't want the lovely coat, don't get a Maltese as that is one of their primary characteristics.  If you want a small dog without that coat, look to other breeds like a Dachshund or something like that with short coats otherwise plan to be mentored and learn how to properly groom a coat yourself and not rely on the occassional trip to a groomers to be shaved down and have painful matts removed.  A good breeder will help you with all this but a bad one will just sell you a pup and not care.<br>  <br>  add:  Do a search on the breed and find the parent club - Maltese club of America or something like that... then get breeder referals and see about learning from a good breeder..  good luck!|`|LN3DoDzCaa	i used to have one but i forgot the web sites but one thig i know for sure is that if u dont want to mess up mtake her or three times every two months to a professinal groomers

Resta que tú sepas como alimentarlo. Ya varios han dado la misma respuesta. Algunos nos hacemos tan a la idea de que una mascota es parte de la familia que les damos de comer lo mismo que nosotros, pero estos animalitos no tienen los mismos hábitos alimenticios que los humanos. Nosotros somos omnívoros -osea, que DEBEMOS comer todo tipo de alimento- pero los gatos no; ni los perros, ni los loritos, blah blah... En el caso de los gatos deberían ser carnívoros, pero hay que tomar en cuenta que están domesticados desde hace miles de a?os y eso ha cambiado un poco sus hábitos alimenticios. En realidad la comida cruda, como a los perros, no les siente del todo bien. Te voy a poner un extracto de un texto que habla justo sobre el tema del chocolate para que saques tus propias conclusiones.<br>  "Chocolate, Café y Té: Estos productos tienen una sustancia llamada teobromina que actúa en el cuerpo del animal: Aumentando la contractilidad del corazón, actuando como un poderosos diurético y produciendo deshidratación, afectando el sistema gastrointestinal, causando vómitos y diarrea y pueden provocar úlceras en la mucosa gástrica. <br>  También afecta el sistema nervioso, causando convulsiones, y a veces, muerte."<br>  Yo que tú dejara el chocolate para el día de San Valentín.<br>  Chau|`|7QAuzjzCaa	Normal sí es, le puede gustar, cada gato tiene su gusto, pero eso no quiere decir que sea bueno, en general el dulce le va a hacer mal, porque su metabolismo no está preparado para ello.

Tous parents de chats savent très bien, qu’on a un chat il devient le ma?tre. <br>  <br>  Blagues à part, ton petit chat te montre son amour, son affection, sa tendresse et son attachement en voulant dormir avec toi. Il essaye de te montrer qu’il t’a adopté, qu’il t’aime, en recherchant la chaleur de ton corps.  <br>   <br>  En lui refusant de dormir avec toi, c’est comme si tu lui disais : Ecoute mon coco, tu me fais chie, tu me tape sur les nerfs, va vois ailleurs si je suis. <br>  <br>  Ton pauvre petit chaton, se sent tout abandonné, d’abords on l’enlève de sa maman, et ensuite sa nouvelle maman, sa maman humaine, sa super maman le rejète. Il demande juste un peu de tendresse, il a besoin de se savoir aimé, et pas seulement quand toi, tu as envie de calins.<br>  <br>  J’ai 5 chats à la maison, 5 adorables chats, tous adultes, mais très calins. Par fois j’ai à peine la place pour moi dans le lit. Personnellement je préfère les avoir dans le lit, qu’ils me montrent leur amour, plut?t qu’ils m’ignorent<br>  <br>  En le rejetant, tu risque qu’il se dise : A quoi bon, pourquoi être gentille avec elle, elle ne m’aime pas. Et quand l’hiver arrive, tu vas avoir froid, et tu aimeras qu’il vienne dans le lit te réchauffer.

BXStnYa4aa	Como te mencioné antes:<br>  <br>  Para poder tener a esta tortuga en condiciones será indispensable un gran acuario.<br>  En verano se puede tener en un estanque al aire libre, pero solo si las temperaturas no bajan de los 20 oC.<br>  Lo ideal sería que el fondo fuera una capa de lodo, y hubiese mucha vegetación.<br>  Deben tener una peque?a zona terrestre por si quieren desovar. El acceso a esta zona debe ser con rampas o rocas, de tal forma que la tortuga pueda salir sin dificultades. El estanque debe tener por lo menos 80 cm de profundidad, y debe disminuir progresivamente, de tal forma que la tortuga pueda salir arrastrándose, puesto que los ejemplares de esta especie son bastante mal nadadores.<br>  No se recomienda tener a estos animales al exterior, ya que requieren mayores temperaturas que las Chelydra. La temperatura deberá rondar los 23 oC. El calentador deberá estar bien protegido, porque si no seguro que lo acabarían rompiendo.<br>  No se deben tener varios machos adultos en un mismo estanque. Lo más recomendable es tener un macho con varias hembras en cada recinto, siempre y cuando tengan más o menos el mismo tama?o.<br>  <br>  Alimentación: Su alimentación está compuesta por peces y crustáceos a los que caza sin piedad. También aceptará moluscos, grandes insectos, anfibios, otros reptiles (son capaces de comer culebras, tortugas de otras especies o juveniles,...), peque?as aves y mamíferos. Si se las acostumbra también aceptarán pescado, carne con poca grasa y corazón de ternera.<br>  Es aconsejable darle a menudo alimento vivo, porque es una manera de mantenerla en forma y con los reflejos bien rápidos.<br>  <br>  Comportamiento: Esta especie se caracteriza por su agresividad, llegando a herir gravemente las manos y dedos de algún cuidador despistado.<br>  Debemos tener en cuenta que no veremos muy a menudo a estas tortugas, porque pasan la mayor parte del tiempo en el fondo del acuario.<br>  Como ya se ha comentado, son bastante malas nadadoras. Acostumbran a caminar por los fondos y a trepar por las paredes del estanque para salir.<br>  Su forma de cazar es realmente curiosa: la tortuga se queda en el fondo totalmente quieta, con la boca abierta y mostrando su lengua que parece un gusano. Cuando se acerca algún pez curioso es absorbido con gran voracidad por la tortuga.<br>  A su camuflaje también le ayuda las algas que suele tener en el caparazón. <br>  <br>  Reproducción: Se ha conseguido algunas veces reproducir estos animales en cautividad, pero no es tarea fácil.<br>  La hembra puede realizar la puesta a distintas distancias: hay hembras que hacen el nido cerca del agua y otras que lo hacen bastante lejos. Los huevos los entierran en un agujero que hacen con las patas traseras.<br>  Las puestas suelen ser de 10-50 huevos. Los huevos son casi totalmente esféricos.<br>  La incubación se deberá hacer a unos 28 oC y con un 90 % de humedad.<br>  <br>  Problemática: Como ya hemos repetido mucho, los principales problemas que podemos encontrar con esta especie es que se hace bastante grande y que es muy agresiva. Por lo demás, se adapta bastante bien a la cautividad.<br>  Nunca se deben soltar ejemplares de esta especie fuera de su hábitat, pues pueden crear un grave problema medioambiental, ya que se adaptan con rapidez y podrían acabar con mucha fauna autóctona.|`|yOOxpEioaa	Tardan varios a?os en lograr su tama?o maximo, pero hay alimento especial de crecimiento, pregunta en la veterinaria o el acuario, y deben de tener por lo menos 2m cuadrados por cada tortuga de estas....<br>  Saludos...|`|vAdBr9Xcaa	deves siempre de tenerla en espacios grandes para que cresca, si toda la vida la tienes en una pesera no cresera lo maximo, yo por eso dejo que mi tortuga ande libre por el patio trasero|`|3dgA6cUzaa	La verdad creo que aunque la cuides nunca llegaran a medir el tama?o que adquieren en la naturaleza, ademas que su crecimiento es lento.|`|tZYiicEmaa	pues ten cuidado cazador porque te arrancara la mano tu tortuga caiman jajaj,broma, debe de ser algo grande , ponle mucho espacio para que tenga mas libertad

8U9exWg8aa	Golden Retrievers are a very fine breed.  They make great family dogs.  They love children, are easily trained as they are known people pleasers and are very loyal.  Goldens are the fourth smartest dog breed in the world.  Retriever puppies can be somewhat unruly, but as adults they exhibit an extreme amount of patience.  Because of these traits Goldens do best with praise and treats when training.  They excel in agility and intelligence.<br>  <br>  As most Retrievers they are food addicts, they will do anything for a tasty treat.  Watching their food in take is crucial as they are prone to gain weight.  You have to be one step ahead of them at all times, if they want something they can figure out how to get it.  Goldens are known to be very needy, they always want to be near you, petted or stroked.<br>  <br>  I have a Golden, she amazes me everyday.  She can on command close every appliance, drawer and door in the house.  She gets the phone on command and is very obediant for an 11 month old puppy.  I've been told she should be a service dog.  I'm running out of things to teach her as she is so smart, I have to be careful in what I show her.  <br>  <br>  Training is crucial, their intelligence warrants learning.  They need something to do, if not they can become quite unruly and destructive because they get bored.<br>  <br>  As dogs go...Goldens are my pick.|`|b660c3756d270b84da09073077f81249aa	Goldens are super sweet!<br>  <br>  check your local animal shelters. you might be able to find a pup, but who know, you might fall in love with an adult.<br>  Good luck|`|7sPupfAEaa	As Sarah says: goldens are super sweet.<br>  I own one...he'll be 2 in November and is still very much a puppy. I am not sure if he'll ever grow up.<br>  The con's of having one...hmmm, if you truly love this breed and do research then there shouldnt be any con's. They require alot of time as they are family dogs that want to be with you. They get lonely when left alone to long or outside. They do shed alot but brushing everyday helps control that.<br>  Goldens are prone to cancer, hip problems, skin problems etc. When you start looking for a pup, make sure the breeder has quality pups and the parents have clearances.<br>  There are so many pro's of owning one: they are goofy, smart, loving, fun, great with people and dogs, easliy trained if you take the time and etc.<br>  Are there any rescue groups where you live? <br>  Good luck in your search for a pup....|`|kqtOHnnzaa	hi im in vic and have 3 week old pure golden retriever pups,i love this breed as they are great family pets and so easy to train!they are very popular an sooo lovable.like most breeds they do get bored and love attention. i give my dogs lots of excercise and attention, fresh bones and stuff to occupy them. great choice in dog.

El nombre<br>  médico para la inflamación del canal externo es 'otitis externa'. Se estima<br>  que el 20% de la población de perros está afectado con esta enfermedad.<br>  <br>  Posibles causas:<br>  <br>  -Alergias como atopía o alergia alimenticia<br>  - Parásitos, ácaros del oído<br>  - Microorganismos : bacterias y hongos<br>  - Cuerpos extra?os<br>  - Trauma, lastimaduras<br>  -Anormalidades hormonales como hipotiroidismo<br>  - Exceso de humedad y anatomía del oído<br>  - Condiciones inmunes o herediatias, y tumores<br>  <br>  Alergias: Los perros con alergias, tanto a la comida o a lo que inhalan, a<br>  menudo tienen problemas en los oídos. De hecho, un problema en el oído<br>  puede ser la primera se?al de una alergia. Como las alergias alteran el<br>  medio ambiente normal del oído se crean infecciones secundarias con<br>  bacterias. Si<br>  solo tratamos la infección, no estamos llegando a la raiz del problema.<br>  También debermos tratar la alergia.<br>  <br>  Parásitos: Los ácaros del oído, son una causa común de los problemas, pero<br>  especialmente ocurre en los gatos. Algunos animales son hipersensibles a<br>  los ácaros y el resultado del rascado que puede ser muy intenso, lo puede<br>  llevar<br>  a que se lastime el oído.<br>  <br>  Bacterias: Un oído normal y sano tiene buenas defensas contra estos<br>  organismos pero si el entorno del oído cambia debido a alguna alergia,<br>  anormalidad hormonal, o exceso de humedad, las bacterias pueden<br>  multiplicarse y romper esta defensa.<br>  <br>  Anormalidades hormonales: La deficiencia o exceso de varias hormonas pueden<br>  tener efectos en la piel y en los oídos.<br>  <br>  Oído: Las bacterias no encuentran mejor lugar para vivir que un lugar tibio,<br>  oscuro y húmedo como el canal auditivo. Los perros con orejas largas y<br>  pesadas como los cocker spaniels pueden tener problemas de oídos por el<br>  exceso de humedad que se crea en los oídos.<br>  <br>  Otras causas: Hay varias causas heraditarias que ocurren en diferentes<br>  razas o líneas de sangre y afectan los oídos. Estas incluyen dermatomitosis<br>  en los Collies y Shetlands, seborrea primaria en los Shar Peis y West<br>  Hightland Terriers.<br>  <br>  Diagnóstico:<br>  <br>  Como hay muchas causas potenciales para los problemas de oído no podemos<br>  decir simplemente "esto es una infección bacteriana", dar antibióticos y<br>  pensar que todo sanará. Generalmente se necesita hacer más. Su veterinario<br>  puede usar un otoscopio para mirar dentro del canal auditivo y determinar si<br>  hay inflamación, si la membrana del timpano está afectada, si hay cuerpos<br>  extra?os, tumores u otras causas potenciales que estén causando el problema.<br>  Se pueden tomar muestras del oído, estudiarlas en un microsocpio y<br>  examinarlas a ver si hay bacterias o ácaros. También puede estudiarse a ver<br>  si es un problema hormonal, alérgico o hereditario.<br>  <br>  Tratamiento:<br>  <br>  El tratamiento dependerá de la causa del problema y de las condiciones<br>  secundarias. Los antibióticos se usan para infecciones bacterianas y los<br>  antifungicidas para infecciones por hongos. El glucocorticoides como la<br>  dexamethasona a menudo se incluyen en estas preparaciones para reducir la<br>  inflamación. Los problemas causados por otras enfermedades como anormalidad<br>  hormonal o alergia deben incluír terapias que traten a todo el animal, como<br>  una inmunoterapia o un testeo alérgico.<br>  <br>  Alergias: Los casos de alergia son tratados limpiando con una<br>  solución común para limpieza de oídos, antihistamínicos y suplementos de<br>  ácidos grasos. Algunas veces se necesitan corticoides. Esto puede darse en<br>  formal oral o inyectable o pueden ser aplicados en forma local. Un testeo<br>  alérgico y la inmunoterapia puede ser la mejor forma de curar los problemas<br>  del oído.<br>  <br>  Acaros del oído: Los ácaros causan peque?os residuos negros que asemejan a<br>  la borra del café. Para esto debe hacerse una limpieza y luego ponerse una<br>  medicación para matar los ácaros, a veces el tratamiento debe continuarse<br>  durante varias semanas.<br>  <br>  Los hongos causan severos problemas en los oídos. Usualmente se observa<br>  cera marrón y mal olor. Se debe limpiar diariamente, pero usualmente estas<br>  infecciones son difíciles de tratar, y se necesitan medicamentos especiales<br>  ya que los antibióticos no actúan sobre los hongos.<br>  <br>  Infecciones bacterianas: Estas infecciones también pueden causar mal olor y<br>  generalmente dan una cera más amarillenta. Si la condición es severa o<br>  crónica, la limpieza sola no resultará y se deberán usar antibióticos. Otra<br>  vez, consulte a su veterinario. Las infecciones de los canales auditivos,<br>  si son severas pueden irse para el oído medio e interno, por lo tanto una<br>  rápida atención al problema es el mejor camino a seguir.<br>  <br>  Limpieza de los oídos:<br>  <br>  El oído de su perros es más en L que el suyo, y es fácil que la suciedad y<br>  restos se coloquen en las esquinas de esta L. Para remover estos restos,<br>  llene el canal con un buen limpiador de oídos, los cuales deben ser un<br>  poquito acidos pero no deben arder. Masajee la base del oído por 20-30<br>  segs. Sace los residuos sueltos y el exeso de fluido con un algodón.<br>  Repita este prodecimiento hasta que no vea más suciedad.<br>  Los cotonetes pueden usarse para limpiar el interior de las orejas y la<br>  parte del canal que Ud. puede ver, pero no deben intruducirse más adentro ya<br>  que esto hará que Ud. sin querer coloque más suciedad en el canal en vez de<br>  sacarla.<br>  Algunos problemas son dolorosos y la mascota debe ser antestesiada para<br>  poder hacer un buen trabajo. Generalmente a su perro le molestará que Ud.<br>  le limpie y toque las orejas y oídos. Hablele durante el proceso de<br>  limpieza, deténgase y prémiela si se está portando bien (no se equivoque y<br>  la premie por consuelo si no se está comportando bien).<br>  Luego de limpiar, deje que el animal se sacuda y espere que se seque un poco<br>  la primer solución que le puso para luego aplicar el otro remedio.<br>  <br>  Preveción de la otitis externa:<br>  <br>  La clave de un oído sano es mantenerlo limpio. Cheque los oídos y orejas<br>  de su mascota semanalmente. Un poco de cera acumulada puede estar bien en<br>  oídos normales. Si su perro concurre mucho al agua, si nada, si tiene<br>  orejas colgantes o una historia de otitis, se recomienda una limpieza<br>  rutinaria de una a tres veces a la semana. El exceso de pelo alrededor de<br>  los oídos puede ser recortado para permitir que entre más aire.<br>  <br>  Recuerde, si su perro muestra una incomodidad severa, si las orejas huelen<br>  mal o los canales auditivos no lucen normales, no se demore en contactar a<br>  su veterinario. Si su mascota llega a tener lastimado el tímpano, algunas<br>  soluciones limpiadoras y medicamentos pueden causar más da?o que bien.<br>  Consulte siempre a su veterinario.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Los problemas pueden generarse por agentes como:<br>  -Hongos<br>  -Productos químicos: entran en contacto con el tegumento (piel) del oído causando irritación e inflamación, ejemplo son: alcohol, hipoclorito, jabones y champúes no específicos para mascotas, etc.<br>  -Alergias: es el caso de la atopía canina que tiene repercusión en el oído produciendo una otitis ceruminosa.<br>  -Tumores: pólipos y adenomas.<br>  <br>  Otitis Media:<br>  <br>  Es una afección bastante frecuente y se manifiesta por otorreas (secreción) prolongadas. Los signos clínicos son los mismos que en las otitis externas, pero están exacerbados de dolor, ya que afecta el tímpano llegando en algunos casos a la ruptura de éste y la secreción se hace más abundante y de mal olor.<br>  <br>  <br>  Otitis Interna:<br>  <br>  La afección del oído interno es más rara, se produce por propagación de una otitis media, por lo tanto aparecen signos en la audición y por último el oído interno en el que se encuentra el caracol y los canales semicirculares. Los tramos externo y medio, sirven para recoger y transmitir los sonidos, mientras que en el oído interno residen la funciones de la audición y equilibrio.<br>  De acuerdo a esta estructura las otitis también se dividen en: externa, media e interna.<br>  <br>  Otitis Externa:<br>  Es la más frecuenta de todas. Los signos clínicos asociados con la otitis externa comprenden grados variables de sacudidas de cabeza, picazón, dolor, olor, exudación y enrojecimiento. El flujo de cerumen constantemente presete aumenta cuando en el oído dejan sentir suacción complicativa.|`|nBHy1Hnbaa	si mejor llevalo al veterinario no le valla asalir un tumor o lo pico algo|`|wijCv6aJaa	Es común la infección del oído externo en los cocker, eso se debe a sus orejas grandes y caídas lo que hace que el oído externo ventile mal y lo hace propenso a las infecciones, el tratamiento es con antibióticos que por supuesto debe ser recetado por el veterinario

Te va a costar un poco que empiece a aceptar otra cosa que no sea alpiste pero si tienes paciencia, conseguirás que tenga una alimentación mucho más sana.<br>  <br>  En la dieta,  se debe incluir frutas, verduras, pienso, zumos de frutas y verduras, mezcla de semillas y como golosina, alguna vez por semana yogurt natural NO azucarado o queso fresco sin sal (fuente de calcio).<br>  <br>  Las frutas y verduras deben ser lo más variadas posibles, igual que los zumos. No abusar de frutas que puedan producir diarreas (kiwis, naranjas, el aguacate directamente prohibido...) y con las verduras, descartar las que sean fuertes (coles, coliflor...) e igual que con las frutas, no abusar por ejemplo, del tomate, que puede producir diarreas.<br>  <br>  La fruta es mejor ofrecerla por la ma?ana, entre otras cosas, porque si no está acostumbrado, al ser el momento con más apetito del día, será más fácil que se anime a probarlo. Al rato, debería tener su comida habitual hasta que se acostumbre a su nueva dieta.<br>  <br>  El pienso hay que procurar que sea de calidad. Marcas muy buenas son Zeigler (la mejor), Zuprem, Exact... El pienso, debe tenerlo siempre a su disposición.<br>  <br>  Las semillas (alpiste, pipas, cacahuetes....) mejor ya por la tarde - noche y si es posible no más de dos o tres veces por semana. Pos supuesto, todo sin sal.<br>  <br>  El yogurt, los zumos, queso, golosinas específicas para ellos,  etc... se pueden administrar en cualquier momento del día e igual que las semillas, mejor solo dos o tres veces a la semana.<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva de ayuda.<br>  <br>  Un saludo<br>  <br>  Clandestina|`|DiKjysjsaa	Eso es raro.<br>  <br>  A ellos no les gusta el alpiste puro, prefieren uno que venden mezclado con semillas de cebada, linaza, avena entre otras. <br>  <br>  También venden unas barras de alimento para periquitos que tiene las semillas que te mencioné arriba y pedacitos de frutas como la manzana.

Un pu?ado de alfalfa seca 3 veces en la semana es de gran ayuda alimenticia y de distracción. <br>  · También les gustan las semillas germinadas. Para iniciar la germinación del mijo, alpiste y avena, empápelas de agua, escúrralas y déjelas a la sombra en un recipiente agujereado.<br>  · Incorpore además pastón en período de crianza, complementado con hueso de jibia como fuente de calcio, alfalfa y golosinas en barras (que son semillas recubiertas con miel). <br>  · Para conservar las aves en buen estado de salud, es muy importante a?adir en forma regular vitaminas solubles en el agua de beber, sobre todo cuando están recién llegadas.<br>  · Entre sus frutas favoritas están las manzanas, peras y plátanos

AA10541444	You can try tying a small bell near the potty door and when you take them out have them see that you ring it and say potty time or something like that and after a few days have them ring the bell either with a paw or by nosing it and give them a treat-take them potty everytime they ring the bell for the first day or two so they get to know what it means. The pottying in the house you can fix by keeping her on a lead and catching her in the act and taking her out immediately or keep a potty log and see how long it takes after she eats to have to go out and take her a few minutes before that.|`|fdc238a041e621b4c0ba8feabf253058aa	Crate her when you are asleep or not home or otherwise unable to supervise her.|`|48a98f0f8f5bcc0d58051094b80b40acaa	I think your best bet is to confine the dog in question in a small room or a crate when you are not able to supervise.  By confining them, most dog will not defecate in an area that they have to stay in.  As in keeping their den clean.  A bathroom, small kitchen, etc.  If you don't like the idea of using a crate, an xpen would work just as well and also keeps them from getting into things that they shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Also, might I suggest that you contact your vet and take her in for a look over.  There might be some underlying medical condition.|`|6b887c34009b2d66b61bb591673b4291aa	Well, I know this will sound mean but either crate train them or lead train them.  Crate training puts the dog in a very large enclosed crate which actually makes them feel very safe as it feels sort of like a den or cave - many dogs will go in their crates to sleep on their own.  More importantly dogs do not like to be close to their waster and a crate will help prevent that - they'll learn if they eliminaate themselves in their crate they then have to lie with it till you come home.  <br>  <br>  If you don't want to try that you could try to 'lead' train them; basically get a somewhat short lead or leash and hook it to something, preferably in the kitchen so if there is an accident it is at least easier to clean off the kitchen floor then the living room rug.  Put their bed close by so that hopefully they won't want to eliminate near their bed.  There would probably be more accidents this way but some folks don't want to listen to their dog cry in a crate.  <br>  <br>  I also walk the dog 1/2 hour after eating.<br>  <br>  I've crate trained and lead trained both puppies and a 2 1/2 yr old lab - works like a charm.  Now they don't need it and can roam the house.  Course I can't keep the lab off the couch when I'm not home but that's another story.|`|8aJb1t2laa	I am  inexperienced in dog training only what i heard from my friend and how they trained their dog. If you go out the room and wait a while or to it should start to go in the room. (the dog should be in the crate at this time) At this point you should you should have a heavy   item in you hand, maybe a book, and drop it. Do this enough times and the dog will start to associate the noise with going to the toilet . Not sure if it will work put it did stop the dog from doing( fingers crossed) <br>  I hope it works and that  you don't find anything unpleasant the next time you step into your room.|`|9d9f2a8bf9a4971c89fda9c1f002d029aa	If you can't supervise start crate training, it works wonders! Or let her outside for a bit while you are busy. Also you could start the bell training method...google training your dog to tell you she has to pee with a bell. My friend did this and it works great, however my dog never caught on he just whines at me when he has to go outside.|`|DxsIzc9yaa	use the puppy training pads,<br>  you can easily get them at any nearby Wal-Mart.|`|QYfrRfniaa	My dog has the same problem.  I don't think there is much you can do if the dog is matured and thinks peeing in the house is okay.  This is something that the dog needs to learn when they are young.  <br>  A common problem arises when trying to housetrain a puppy in the wintertime.  It's cold outside and the puppy learns to dislike the outdoors, so they just pee inside.|`|jOzv9K4Eaa	Keep them out there at different times and wait until they use it
sijgpfQqaa	My little grandson suffers from Tuberous Sclerosis, a rare disorder that causes severe epileptic fits. My daughter's little Border terrier has never been trained, but reacts whenever he is going to have a fit, by jumping off the sofa, and running around in mad circles. My daughter is pre-warned, that a fit is coming, and is therefore prepared.Recently, she was in my house with my grandson, and my great stupid lump started acting strangely, by running around eratically, and howling. A few seconds later, the little lad had a fit. My grandson's specialist was told about this behaviour, and he was thrilled, as they had been discussing a seizure dog amongst the hospital staff. They reckon epileptic people emit a scent, just before a seizure, and the dog picks up a scent that is unfamiliar to them, causing them to react strangely.|`|SzkJlrAnaa	I've heard two different reasons. One is that the dogs can detect a chemical change via scent and are able to alert the person to an oncomming seizure. <br>  The other reason is that there are slight behavioural changes. Personally, I believe the first reason more than the second.|`|hvBeLr6Oaa	it's said that animals hav a sixth sense and dogs are also know to hear their owners comming from up to 3 km's away..|`|kIIf9Z6Eaa	Some think the dog is sensing minor chemical changes in the person's body that happen right before a seizure.  Whether the dog is actually "smelling" a chemical signal or can tell by small changes in behavior is still unknown.  What is for certain, dogs are much more sensitive to the world than we are!|`|iVQULHqYaa	They are trained by specialists to do this. If you have problems with seizures, look on the Internet and you will find someone who will train your dog.|`|AA11097657	It's the same as when they can detect a thunder storm coming.<br>  <br>  Very strong sent for dogs to the changes in the balance of chemicals & atmosphere.<br>  <br>  Clever dogs!
mT28ruiuaa	I would definetly get her teeth checked, that could cause alot of problems. I would do that first, and if nothing is wrong then maybe you are hitting her teeth by accident while putting the bit in, just be very careful and try to see what is bothering her about it most is it when you touch her ears, or when the bit touches her teeth?...anoher ting could be is, do you live in a colder place?...maybe you need to warm the bit up before you put it in her mouth that culd definelty be what it is make sure you warm the bit up if it is cold by rubing the bit in your hands.<br>  <br>  <br>  I sure do hope that helped, I know that this can be very frustrating.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Is there a broken tooth or mouth sore?<br>  Is the bit clean and free of any bacteria buildup?<br>  There may be pain associated with taking the bit in the past and that causes refusal now.|`|iz03uvV4aa	Focus on getting her to lower her head for starters :)<br>  <br>  How you can do this:<br>  <br>  1. Take your hand and put it on top of her head, between the ears on what is called "the pole".<br>  2. Apply a small amount of pressure here<br>  3. If she doesnt give in, apply a little more and a little more, until she puts her head down.  She may not leave it down, but the first step is just understanding the right amount of pressure to get her to do this and then going from there.<br>  Remember that every time she puts her head down and gives into the pressure, give her a rub on her nose and tell her she is good. She must know that what your teaching her, and her responding that way is good. Always use positive reinforcement. Once she gives in here and there, work on making her keep her head there by making her put her head down as LOW as she can put it, keeping it there, and end the lesson by putting her head back into a neutral position and then praising. YOU always want to be the one who ends the lesson.<br>  <br>  Once youve got this down, start playing with her mouth. Rubbing her nose, putting your fingers into the sides of her mouth until youve literally bored her with it and she stands there.<br>  <br>  Once youve got these two down, start working on putting the bit in.  She should be 1. comfortable with you touching her in her mouth and 2. she now knows how to put her head down so its just a matter of applying these and slipping the bit in and out.  Do it a few times, before you get on with your ride/lesson.<br>  <br>  Also, I might point out that if she hasnt had her teeth done recently, make sure its not painful for her.  It may very well be as simple also as having her teeth floated!<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope this helped!<br>  <br>  Its worked wonders with my 3yo :)<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  If she is good with everything as far as her head and her mouth being played with, definatley get her teeth checked! You're doin the right thing.  If only they could just speak to us huh? hahaha <br>  Good Luck! :) You're definatley doing the right thing by having the vet out to check out her teeth! :)|`|4OuPmhYVaa	she probably dose need her teeth floated but if that dose not work, try using a bit warmer first before you try to get the bit in he mouth, a cold bit is really painful to them and can make them bit shy, also try instead of food, try a little honey, i used to work at a ranch and one of the horses just would not take the bit for anything, then one day I had the idea to put honey on it and it worked. now he gladly accepts the bit, even though the honey may make them play/ lick the bit while ridding, that is a good thing.|`|9Dr0xmTCaa	Well considering you wrote besides coating it with food, I don't have anything much, but I do have a few sugestions (one does have to do with coating it with food...kind of) <br>  1. Dip it in Apple juice or wipe an apple around it and let your horse smell it first<br>  2. take your pointer finger and thumb and GENTLY squeeze her mouth<br>  3. DO NOT force her mouth open<br>  hope i helped!!|`|TguNJK8zaa	you could be clicking her teeth when you put it in so when the bit comes she won't open her mouth. Work with her mouth by rubbing her gums (not all horses like it but many do) on the front of her teeth and bars. And make sure you don't click her teeth with the bit!|`|rxZHkhdVaa	DALLAS had a wonderful answer, which I only have one thing to add to it: You may be pulling on her mouth while you ride her.Be softer with your hands when riding. If she needs her teeth floated you can check by watching her eat. If she drops a lot of food, and eats very slowly, she needs her teeth floated. If not, it's just you. If she can't eat it's her teeth, if you're pulling, it's her mouth-corners and tongue.
5iSTwjA3aa	One of my dogs does that too.  He does it because it is a sensitive area that I am petting.  Though you should really contact your vet just to make sure that she's not doing it due to pain.  She could just be sensitive but there is always a possibility that there is an underlying issue.|`|AslKMqr3aa	Does she look like she has any bloodhound in her its commen for bloodhounds to do this|`|07YZ3qrxaa	My dog also does this. It's completely normal. She probably does this either because she's intimidated by laying on her back (in the wild this shows submission) or because she likes the stimulation which you are providing. I do not think a vet trip is necessary.|`|6efb1915453e10ba302a119e6d5cbf7baa	Could she be having muscle spasms as a reaction to your touch?  I've never seen it before... hard to picture what you are describing!<br>  <br>  If she's a stray, it wouldn't hurt to have the vet check her out to make sure that she's in good health.  Show the vet what happens when you pet her, and they'll let you know if it is something to worry about.
4f4d614622c02f682bb59109a34a1575aa	I had a dog that had a severe urinary infection that had foamy pee it was also kind of thick|`|5iSTwjA3aa	He might not be getting enough water through out the day.  You should really call your vet to make sure it's not a serious urinary track infection.|`|4KsnCXI1aa	It sounds like a possible urinary tract infection, but it could be other things, as well. I would take him to the vet, as he may have eaten something hazardous.|`|ArA6EV0laa	why are you looking at your dogs pee so closely?|`|bA1hstGyaa	Oh, come on! You know why, don't you?<br>  <br>  He was out running with the dogs last night and stopped at the Doggys Dew Drop Inn and had a few too many foamy delicious beers.<br>  <br>  The thing to do is to let him have a hair of the dog that bit him!<br>  <br>  But you already know that, right?|`|n4BgZI2waa	It could be a urinary tract infection or something like that. Call the vet and see what they say about it. If they think you should bring him in try and get a urine sample from him. Sounds gross but when you let him outside follow him around with a bowl and when he squats stick the bowl under him. This might scare him and he might not want to go but it is worth a try and it will be less stressful on the dog then having the vet take it from him.|`|tHw47PUZaa	i'd get it checked but wouldn't panic.
xDFJn3pJaa	She is getting ready to nest! That tells you the baby bunnies will soon be born and the mother is preparing the area of her surroundings to give birth to her young.|`|zXxQWGI6aa	Its normal. Its just shedding its fur.|`|AA11993638	do you see it actually pulling it out or just the clumps? It could just be shedding for some reason, or it could have fleas.|`|AA11534027	If it is a female, it might be pregnant, and is making her nest to have her kits born. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  any more ?'s email me at nkisela@yahoo.com|`|LDdd6uAQaa	Un neutered females quite commonly pull out their fur when in the pink(on heat).<br>  just because she is pulling out her fur it does not mean she is going to have babies, that is unless you have an un neutered buck in there of course.<br>  Un neutered females can do this on a regular basis and if not having babies can become quite stressful for them. I therefore suggest that if you are not going to breed from her, have her neutered and she will stop this behaviour along with any temper tantrums and territorial tendencies that she may have. Neutering also prevents womb/uterine/ovarian cancer. I have experienced this in a rescue bunny and it is not pleasant and there is no cure.|`|gYsx5Br8aa	Is it a female and is it possible that she could be pregnant, Does build nests a day or so before they give birth.|`|wlhMUwKsaa	In the last couple of weeks?

Is the rabbit female?  Has it been with a male rabbit?  I have a female rabbit and the only time she pulled her fur out was when she was getting ready to have her babies.  The fur is coming from her belly.  If you can check her tummy for the missing fur.  If she doesn't want to be held then leave her be but expect some babies.|`|2QTayZpZaa	Could be several things. One thing is she might be pregnant, or having a false pregnancy. Also could be poor diet, bored, stress, or might have fleas or parasites.|`|3RgannW2aa	If it's a female and she's pregnant she is probably getting ready to have babies.|`|7QY6LBjXaa	It is common if they are "nesting".

M3jRtq2Aaa	no<br>  <br>  If you have more than 5dogs then you have to have a kennel permit if that is what you are talking about.  If you are talking about simply kennel club papers, then no.  You just find it easier to sell registered dogs.|`|p7swtBYzaa	No, any fool can breed dogs and they often do.<br>  You would be incredibly irresponsible to breed a dog without knowing it's bloodlines or being sure it has healthy genetics.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	To a reputable breeder. yes. don't breed a dog unless you know what you are doing. You want to breed out defects. You do it for the breed. To bring up the quality. Not to just make money. German Sheperds never used to have defects. It was years of careless breeding. Alot of breeds didn't. Don't breed just for the money.|`|43JgLpkKaa	i would not buy a puppy from a breeder who could not provide a good background and papers on a dog. i know you get what you pay for, and a cheap dog without papers is a red flag to me.  why would anybody want to buy a dog, and not even be able to check the bloodlines for health problems and the parents health either???? anyone who sells puppies without papers is a backyard breeder to me, and i want nothing to do with them!!!|`|q1GnMRxxaa	Now a days, people will sell mutts, but if you want to sell a puppy that is a particular breed, but without papers, you can do it, but you have to reduce the price way down to like $100 each without the papers. The reason behind this is even if you have both the mom and dad at your home, no one knows for sure if it is a pure breed dog without the papers.|`|zZZnQuQJaa	Yes, otherwise you'll be fined $10,000 by the State.|`|33e18371c231caed609d57632064134caa	didn't get them. not gonna breed him|`|5iSTwjA3aa	If you want the puppies to be registered then both parents will have to have papers.

No, you do not. Breeding, in it's very most basic terms, means letting your dogs have sex. Any dog can have sex! That's a lot of the reason we have the overpopulation problems we do today. <br>  <br>  Now, lets ask another question. Why do you want to breed your dog? <br>  If you are just looking for a cute litter of puppies, have you though about what you are going to do with them? If they are unregistered and you are trying to sell them, good luck. If you are giving them away, then you are seriously risking these dogs ending up in a shelter (easy come easy go, right?). Do you really want to have to deal with doing that do a dog?<br>  Even having papers doesn't mean a dog should be bred! For instance, AKC registration does NOT indicated that your dog is genetically healthy, meets breed standards, or ANYTHING besides that both his sire and dame were registered as full blooded dogs. Do you know about health testing for your breed? About breed standards, and about conditions that your dog may have that makes them a poor candidate for breeding because you don't want to perpetuate the problem? I doubt you do, given the question. <br>  <br>  Breeding is not something that should be done lightly. There should be considerable research into the dogs pedigree and consideration of the physical traits of your female. This will help you find a stud that will balance off your dogs minor flaws and produce a litter of puppies that should be of even better quality than the parents!<br>  <br>  I could do this all day, but I don't have time. If you are determined to breed, you are going to do it anyway. Go to the Continental Kennel Club and get your dog registered. E-mail me if you can't figure out how and I will help.|`|Yq2MWKMeaa	<~~~ No - we had ours neutered and spayed ...|`|dId7B1y0aa	nope they will do it with out papers. they do it in the hall  they did in the kitchen they got some on there paws and wiped it on the wall|`|dPpOgny9aa	only if you want to sell as a pure bred. pups are worth more with papers.and no you don't need papers to bred your dog just have to find a bredder that will bred your dog with out papers.|`|hPEXlXjPaa	You don't have to have papers to breed your dog but if your wanting pure bred and to sell you need papers to verify the breed.|`|pRnUS4dDaa	Wow.

DOezrywkaa	She sounds barn sour to me. This means that she is kind of lacking when you ride her, is reluctant to leave the stall, and wants to try the easy way out to get back to the barn as fast as she can.<br>  <br>  1. Enforce your signals clearly when you ask her to trot. When she slows down, keep asking for it. Gradually amp up your aids, first with nudges from the heel and eventually to sharp kicks. This is the fair was to make her move- you are giving her the chance to go before your signals get harsher, and if she chooses to ignore you, that's her own fault. <br>  <br>  2. Once again, keep using clear signals and elevating your aids. If you are comfortable with a riding crop, and your mare knows how to respond to one, you could try that too. If you prefer not to use artificial aids, stick to your good old leg, seat, and voice.<br>  <br>  3. By "falling" into the canter, she might be having some trouble with her hindquarters. In fact, everything she is doing wrong now might be the result of pain, especially if you've had her a while and these problems are just popping up. <br>  <br>  4. Something that I find helpful is that everytime she backs up is to take the reins and continue backing her up. Then move her back into place, but before mounting, move back back back. Repeat this a few times and try again. The trick is that at first you are allowing the horse to do what she wants, but then she actually starts to want to move forwards and is asking, "Please, can we stop moving backwards?". It's kind of like reverse phsycology, strange as it sounds.<br>  <br>  Get her checked by a vet just in case she's in pain, and please consider that this might just be because of old age. Good luck!|`|cQpYvlr9aa	Maybe she is upset is she lonly or is there anything that has changed recently GOOD LUCK ;)|`|OJIXRFxMaa	For the how hse rarely keeps trotting and cantering, i'd carry a crop, ponies are generally lazy, they need encorgament, my trainer always said "Ask, tell, command." So first i'd squeeze for a few times before brining anything with the crop, than give her a kick, do that maybe once or twice to see if she'll go, if hse still refuses, give her a tap with the crop along with a good leg command. She might just be refusing your aids. It takes work, the command part, give her a small smack BEHIND your leg on her rump and give her a small kick. <br>  <br>  As far as her canter goes, whenever she starts going into a fast trot, slow her down,i try to get the horses i ride to go from a canter, but as soon as she starts going fast, you sit the canter. (If you're riding english.) and ask her to slow down so you have a nice sitting canter, and than ask for the canter from that, if she just starts 'running' do this again. it could take a while for her to get into it, give her a little tap behind your leg.<br>  <br>  As when she tries to move backwards, are you gathering your reins when you mount up? if not, do that so she can't get anywhere, you can also try mounting her up so her nose/rump is against the wall and mount up. Also try having somebody stand there and hold her so she can't move. My pony that i ride has the same problem. he movies everywhere, what i do is i mount up i get down into my saddle, and if he movies, i pull him into a halt and if he does back up, i push him forward i push him forward for a moment and than i hold him into a halt again and i hold him there for a few minutes until he stays still, i than praise him by patting him on the neck and letting him walk forward on a longer rein. this part will take patience, as you said, she is a lazy pony, she doesn't want to get ridden.<br>  <br>  When riding a pony, you need to be a bit firmer, especially if they are lazy, you don't need to be agressive but just firm, you need to tell them that you are in charge. I'd be sure to carry a crop at all times if you can use one on your pony.<br>  <br>  i hoped i helped. :]|`|3fgSNGZSaa	When you want her to go MAKE her go first you squeeze then lightly kick then kick and when she trots if you feel her slow down cluck and ask tap her with your feet (some horses can canter from a stop or walk but others might have to from a trot)|`|6a221e63714f9d33724ccb40cd162c0aaa	Perhaps it's your riding that may make you think she's lazy. Always keep your leg on her, and if needed, maybe carry and crop (it usually perks them up.) And by the way she's "falling" into a canter, it sounds like she's probably a bit unbalanced/unconnected to her hindquarters. Maybe some longing work and transition work could help with that. I'd ask an instructor or good horse person at your barn, they could help you with that. The mounting thing is just disrespect. When she does that, quickly correct her, then pretend it never happened and try to mount again.<br>  <br>  The only other thing I could maybe think of is perhaps she's a little ring sour? Maybe take some fun trail rides or lay off the ring work for a while. That might help her a bit.|`|6ezURcweaa	I think She wants to get out of working, and is taking advantage of you. She is moving at the mounting block probably because she just doesnt want you to get on. You getting on her means she has to work. Shes probably thinking "Well if i move, then she cant get on!"  Which is bad because is can produce into a big problem.. especially on trail. You dont want your horse to be like that if you have to get back on , on a trail ride when you just had a break to eat lunch.<br>  <br>  Dont just make her walk up to the mounting block and leap up best you can, you have to make her listen. give her a chance although. Everytime she starts to back up, jump off your mounting block or get your foot out of your stirrup and make her back up, do circles. She will realise its better to let you get on because not getting on is way more work. Everytime she tries to do this.. your going to get meaner and more aggressive. Im not saying go out growling.. make her circles tighter, make her back up even more. Just increase her circle and back up time everytime she doesnt do it.<br>  <br>  Do you ride with a crop, dressage whip, or spurs? Well before getting into those.. i see lots of horses become dead. I have to try to teach them to become soft again. Alot of horses will do this because sometimes when riders cant get them to move into the gait they want them to, they just start kicking, kicking, kicking. Their heels flying into those rib cages.. and then the horse gets upset, annoyed and doesnt give a hoot if you want to move faster. You have to ask with your seat first(your butt muscles), then your calves and seat, and then heels. it is boring.. but it works on becoming softer again. But anyway.. you could also try some spurs, or a crop.<br>  here are some prince of wales spurs, they are mild, im also going to suggest some ball spurs. Although if you dont know how to ride with spurs, get a trainer to teach you that. Otherwise you'll be bumping her all the time.<br>  <a href="http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=SLT650753%2034%208172" rel="nofollow">http://www.statelinetack.com/itemdy00.as...</a><br>  <br>  You could also try a simple crop, or dressage whip. Good luck. You also need to get a nice trot going thats easy to go into the canter with. It has to be soft. She sounds barn sour aswell... i know other posters have posted things about it so im not going to go into detail about that|`|AA10767477	1) If she won't trot use a firmer voice then normal and turn her in a really tight circle then go on, keep doing this til she responses then in a good voice tell her she's good only if she does what she's suppose to.<br>  2) Take a new route home and /or keep turning her in circles til you get to the barn<br>  3) Keep doing drills like walk to trot, trot to canter, walk to canter etc. <br>  4) Mounting: try putting her butt up near a wall so she can't back up and right away get after her if she tries to do something new. remember horses hate pressure but always release pressure when they do something good.<br>  And 5) be patient take your time and use a firm voice when needed..Good luck|`|BINKsgveaa	For the 1, 2, and 4 problems you listed she is acting barn sour. Which means she would rather stay home then work. You will have to work with her to keep her moving and paying attention to you. Make home feel like work for her and a trail ride fun and relaxing. Tie her when you mount or have someone hold her so she can't move away from you. For the #3 problem it sounds like she is out of shape and heavy on the forehand if she has to work so hard to canter.  Work on half halts at the canter and trot to build up her strength so it will be easer for her to transition up to the canter. Good Luck!|`|DfAQu3ywaa	firstly you say she rarely keeps trotting,could you be doin something wiv ur hands that stops her from trotting.horses usally stop with a little pull on the reins.all horses race home especially if they know they are heading in the right direction for home.carry a whip with you when you are riding and a sharp tap on the shoulder should get her moving.often horses do move when u mount,my horse does move when i mount just try and pull bck on the reins and she should stop still.|`|FEkpBdfaaa	when your trotting carry a crop with you. I hate doing that but just tap her on the shoulder if she won't trot. I ride a horse named Egon at a riding stable. He is the LAZIEST horse EVER! haha! whenever i try to trot him, i have to constantly keep leg pressure, I like to compare it to squeezing a tube of toothpaste that's almost empty. When she races home, you need to yell and pull back on the reins and make her turn around and go back until she goes at the pace you want her to return home at. Do the same thing when she falls into a canter. When she moves when you try to mount, tell her that shes being bad, and think in your head that shes being bad and that your gonna "beat" her tail if she don't behave. If you think that in you're head then she will pick up that you are mad with her and she will figure out to obey you so that you aren't mad, also for awhile, let somebody hold her while you're mounting so that she doesn't do this, and then try it by yourself. Hope I helped!|`|M046uvm7aa	when she rarely trots squeeze gently with your legs. if all else has failed get a pair of spurs(be carefull they are not too hard on her!!) when she goes into the canter agenst your will seesaw your reins  and sit deep in the sadle try not to rock your hips. when she races home sit deep in the saddle and keep hard contact with her mouth and dont be afraid to be firm. when she moves while mounting keep a tight hold to the reins and have someone helping you hold her.also try swiching her feed. i find that pure pride 100 works well and try using a suppliment that calms horses. GOOD LUCK!!|`|Q4JCeVB9aa	She is doing this because you allow her to.  <br>  <br>  For trotting:  you keep giving the trotting cue and quit immediately when she responds.  You just keep putting her into the trot day after day until she understands she stays in it until you ask for a transition change.<br>  <br>  You must understand how to ask for gaits, how to do transitions first.  <br>  <br>  2.  This is called barn sour.  There are many ways to fix this.<br>  I'll edit and give you some posts next.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  go into my answers  to page 9, 3 weeks ago, by Monike,  "I need help..."<br>  <br>  There are excellent answers as to what to do with a barn sour horse.<br>  <br>  3.  She is gaining speed.  Unless you are showing her and need to transition from walk or stop directly to canter, moving from trot to canter shouldn't pose a problem.<br>  <br>  4.   Let her.  Go with her quickly.  Ask for more movement from the ground.  Over and over people want to pop their mounts or pull them into the stop.  Just let her move and ask for more quick circles out of your way.  Eventually she will figure out that moving away makes her work.  It usually takes less than a half dozen times and 5 minutes to fix this.|`|VbMBA1FQaa	She sounds spoiled to me.<br>  1. Once she is trotting and you feel her getting ready to stop you need to push her forward with your legs.  <br>  2. Who's in control.  You can use a crop/bat to encourage your horse.  As for the way home, try doing circles when she starts to rush.  Turn around and go a little ways back the other way and then turn towards home again.  If she rushes then do it again.<br>  3. Work in a ring.  Practice asking for the canter and if she starts trotting stop her and ask again.  <br>  4. Again this sounds like a training issue. Make sure you aren't holding the reins to tightly and pulling back.|`|YvTWeP02aa	maybe a change of feed would give her a bit more enthusiasm, but be careful cause this could also cause her to become too hyperactive. Id also check tack to make sure its not restricting her in any way... Hope that helps x|`|cIdnmGcTaa	A good thing to carry with a alzy horse is a whip. To encourage her.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't listen an wants to stop, tap her on the shoulder with the whip to keep her trotting. DO the same to get her cantering, while using plenty of leg aids.<br>  <br>  The reason why she walks abckwards when you're mounting is because she's a lazy pony and doesn't want to be ridden.<br>  <br>  Also she only runs home ebcause she knows it's home and that where you unsaddle and feed her.<br>  <br>  I had to deal my fat appaloosa being lazy when I bought him and now he's a fir barrel horse 8 months later :)<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hQu3YsGzaa	Trainning is the answer to all the problems. Tess thinks she can get away with everything. Train her 30 mins Max each day she will soon no who the boss is.|`|wa2Am5m2aa	For her going slow, use a crop or a whip.  If you are good enough, consider spurs but only if you are good enough to wear them so you dont drill holes in the side of her (not literally).  When she races home, turn her in small circles when she ignores your signals to stop or slow down.  For moving backwards when mounting, put her so that her butt is near a wall or corner so when you get on, it will prevent her from moving backwards because the wall is there.<br>  <br>  Why she is doing this?  There could be many possibilities...you could maybe not be giving proper signals, she could be trained incorrectly, she may not want to listen at all, or she knows she can get away with ignoring you.

qeOlkRM0aa	I assume he's already been weened.  Give him a few days to get adjusted to his new home. He's going to need his space for a bit, so let him chill, let him know that you are around but don't get all in his face just yet. He wants company, but he's probably not sure about you yet. Make sure you are giving him the same food he got at the store or breeder.  Once he's settle in a bit, then you can start teaching him to step up. You put your finger in front of him at foot (or perch) level close so he can easily step onto it, while saying "UP". You'll need to be patient and friendly while teaching the Up command. If he's a nipper, you will get nipped at first, but I've never met a parrot that didn't learn to step up in time. This is important because it tell the bird who is is charge.  NOTE: this can be tricky if your bird is territorial. He won't be yet, but its possible down the road. Eventually, most birds will let you know if they are ready to step up, by "assuming the position" to step onto your finger. Its different for each bird. Also, keep your thumb tucked in-its a favorite target for beaks.|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	You can begin training immediately. It's important to only used trust based training techniques, such as "touch training" described here; http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...    Touch training can begin while the bird is still INSIDE the cage and makes it so that you never betray his trust by grabbing him out. You can eventually touch train him out of the cage and work from there.     More training tips; http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/|`|enC9TvxUaa	-Take things at HIS pace.

This guy will be around for many-many years, so take your time in gaining his trust!
Um8osMNuaa	They eat poo for a few different reasons.  lt can be a learnt behaviour from the b*tch who will eat the pups faeces to keep their sleeping area clean. The pups can copy this.  lt can also be done if their diet is lacking in essential nutrients, changing the diet may help.  Some dogs just do it because they like it.  The longer it goes on the harder the habit is to break.  You need to clean up any faeces immediately, and if you see him going to eat any shout, "No" and offer him a treat, he should soon come to realise that leaving the poo gets him a treat instead.  l've been going through the same thing with my 6 month old pup, the treat trick seems to be working.  Although my pup only eats the poo of my eldest Lab, he likes to get it on its way out while it's steaming...yuck!!!!|`|2s5WSVbPaa	This might help, it s from pet behaviour website.    http://www.petbehaviourcentre.com/articl...|`|ctiKoGGfaa	The reason they are doing it is usually due to low quality foods.

Does he do it when you leave him alone? A lot of dogs show odd behaviors when they are left alone and chew furniture and tear things up out of anxiety and frustration when they would never do those things in front of their owner. I suggest you write down what the factors are that makes him do this because it could be a lot of things. Luckily, mine doesn't do that.|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	A vitamin deficiency|`|riCfCxjEaa	Ugh!   This is the most frustrating thing out there!  My dog does the same thing so I feel your pain!  Coprophagia (a fancy name for poop eating) is not uncommon and may be due to nutritional, metabolic, or behavioral issues.  while it's disgusting, it's not harmful (if its their own). First, get a vet check and make sure there's nothing physically wrong.  It's more common in dogs that are fed once a day so maybe try spreading his food allotment out to two feedings a day.  Also, a low quality food may trigger it, make sure meat is the  1 ingredient in your dog food.  Sometimes adding a bit of canned food to the dry can make a difference.  What I try to do after my dog defecates is call her immediately to the house with something really yummy like a bit of chicken or hot dog and clean it up while she's in the house.  Try not to rush up and scold her or give her attention for it in anyway, that may be a reward to her for eating it.  Sometimes just getting it before she does is the most effective.  I hope this helps! good luck!|`|7ciw1aCXaa	Why is he eating his poo?   I don't know.   Do you let him lick your face?    As to how to stop him, your vet has given you good advice, but I expect it will grow out of it. There is a danger of worms, of course.|`|AA11331047	It is a sign of a vitamin deficiency.

One of the reasons you should never let a dog lick your face!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Many pups do this. There is no danger of worms as long as he's eating his own poo. As long as you keep up to date on his worming there's no danger even if he eats the poo of other dogs, which is also common.     There's no proof pups do this because of a vitamin deficiency, in fact it's highly unlikely this is the reason, because even low-quality dog foods cover the basic vitamin and mineral requirements. Also, it's such a common behaviour among pups it's unlikely half the pups in the western world are suffering from vitamin deficiences! Some people theorise it's a behaviour they pick up from their mothers, who clear up the pup's poo when they're very young by eating it - the pup learns to think this is a correct behaviour.    Puppies mostly grow out of this behaviour. There are many things you can feed them that sometimes discourages it (you can also try 'Deter' tablets from vets or pet shops) but often nothing works.     The only thing you can really do to help the pup grow past this unpleasant (but harmless) behaviour is not make a big deal out of it - if he does actually get to eat it then don't do or say anything about it. Preferably catch him as he does go to eat it and stop him with a sharp NO but nothing more, but ideally stop him eating his poo by picking it up before he can get to it! If he doesn't get to eat it for a while eventually he should lose the habit.    Chalice
OA7cPgGNaa	You can get a couple books. Each author has his or her own opinion on what they feel are good ways to house-train and train a dog in general.    It is best to read all you can on the issue and take a little bit of all.     You should NEVER hit, kick, punch, yell, or scream at your dog. Ever. This could make them be afraid of you and not want to potty in front of you, causing them to leave you "surprises".     For my clients, I do a 1 hr session for house breaking and house manners. It is $40 a class, and you can take it for as long as you need. "Most" people don't need a second in third class.    I would recommend for you that you get a crate and crate your dog. If you can't watch it 100% of the time (reliably, it can be hard when you are watching your favorite show or cooking), it needs to go in a crate or in a small confined room (bathroom, laundry room, etc) with a baby gate up.    Set times for feedings is great. Usually a dog has to go within 15-20 of feedings. Long walks is also good, as when dogs are taken out of their territory it makes them want to urinate more (and stimulates the bowels, so they will want to poop).     Try the crate training. Your dog will greatly benefit from it.|`|piCOVRC6aa	you don't need that stuff. just kick it if it misbehaves|`|mULJMC0waa	You would be better off getting a book and doing it yourself. You need to be patient with the dog, but need to show them who is boss. They don't learn automatically. Having someone else train your dog is not helpful to you because when they give the dog back they can relapse. If you have the money to shell out. A couple of sessions will be good. I am not sure what the going rate on dog training is. I think it is something like 30-50 dollars a session. Good luck.|`|Iyl5N9EKaa	First you need to learn how to spell your dogs proper breed name. Secondly, I would go to your local SPCA to see if they have training done there. I took my dog to ours and the training is great because if you are having problems they can show you exactly what to do and alternate methods if one way is failing. Not to mention your money goes back into the dogs at the shelter. Books are good to read but visual training is best. Stanley Coren writes good dog books. Usually they have it as 7-8 week courses depending on location. Once a week for an hour is best. You should be training your dog constantly. At home make it 5 minute sessions to keep the dog interested and one trick at a time. Don't try another trick if he hasn't mastered the previous one. Treats are great motivators as well. Hot dogs are cheap and work great. Consistancy and routine are key in proper training. Good Luck!|`|ctiKoGGfaa	Do it yourself. If the pup potties inside, scoop him up , take him outside. If he finishes going outside, praise him like crazy. Do NOT punish the pup for going inside, he will think hes being punished for "going potty" NOT for going potty inside. He doesnt know the difference. Feed pup at the same time everyday, and at night time give pup ice cubes instead of water. Take pup outside in the morning, be patient and WAIT until he goes potty and praise, praise,praise and start giving a verbal command, like "God boy, potty outside. I have even gone as far as picking poops from inside the house, putting it in the back yard and taking pup out to sniff the poo and praise him. Take him out often, every hour if you have to. Some get it after only a week others take 6 months. Watch for signs he needs to go, like circling or sniffing, when he does, say "outside" and take pup out. Be diligent and good luck.

Best thing is to take him out when he is most likely to have to eliminate and also paying attention to him more than most people do to their dogs (dogs watch us much more then we watch them..)  so take him out immediately upon waking up (if this means sleeping in sweats to get out asap, then do so for a few weeks), about 10 15 min after eating, right after playing or as soon as you notice him slowing down, when he wakes from a nap etc.  Put a phrase to it such as "do your business" when he starts to squat.  Praise when he goes outside and in the am.. keep him out an extra 10 min after doing his business just to be sure he is completely done.  DO NOT yell or physically reprimand him if he has an accident inside, this will just make him find a hiding place to go do it in.. Good luck.

Sadly, I sit on my tailbone all day. I'd want to be mature, but still young. Maybe, 5 or 6?     I'd want to compete in cutting, watching the fear in the ignorant calf's eyes, as he tries to outsmart and outmaneuver me. Unfortunately (for him), I'm always one step ahead, always watching every move he even thinks to make, reading his thoughts clearly running across his face. Laughing as I race across the arena, cutting him off right before he hits the herd. When me and my human are done dancing with the little calf, I'd unblock him, giving him his freedom to return to the herd, bidding my farewells. Until next time, little calf.     I don't care what color I'd be, as long as I had my human to brush me off when I was dirty. If my horse character reflects my human-self, then I'd be a dark, honey colored palomino, with white-blonde mane and tail. Though, if I was a horse I wouldn't care what my coat would be. As long as it was clean, and I had a long flowing tail and a long mane that draped over my neck and sholder. I wouldn't care who rode me, as long as they rode me with respect and diginity. If my rider was to pull on mouth, or kick my ribs with too muh force, then off he would be. I'd buck until that sap sucker was face down in the dirt. I wouldn't be a bad horse, just one that would want to be treated like a partner, not a slave. I'd give forgiveness to the beginners, and the children, and teach them the proper way to handle me, while giving them the best gift in the world, the gift of riding.|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	I would be a 14.0 - 14.2 Appaloosa pony, Welsh pony, Arabian, or just any breed...maybe a cross of something. I would be 3yr old mare. I would do Hunter and jump to 4ft. I would be good with experienced riders and do well in shows. Id be a little moody though too hahaha
x4etCpauaa	Violet dragon gobies?    Grow around a foot and will eat any fish that can fit in their mouths. Also live in brackish water. Tattered fins usually means fighting. Corydoras are peaceful so they wouldn't be nipping.    ("'\(o.o)/"')|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	No, he has senegal birchirs. Petsmart advertises them as dinosaur eels. They shouldnt be nipping each other. Well, It depends on their size. Most of them will grow to about 16 inches and eat whatever they can fit in their mouths. BUT, you need to get those cory cats out of there. When your birchir grows, he'll try to eat the catfish. But the catfish have spines on both sides. He wont be able to swallow them, and he wont be able to spit them out. So both fish will die.    I have two small ones together and there is no aggression there. but I have heard adults and subadults dont really get together very well.    You dont need bottom feeders. Thats what the birchirs are anyways.|`|499ce2344d684feb00ec06bcf55edd71aa	These things get huge, your tank is way too small for these fish. Also, chances are they are fighting for space. Your tank is too small for even just one of these.=
RZAjrv8Xaa	Please, Please go to a shelter! Those dogs truly need homes and for the people who are just giving dogs away need to be stopped and have their dogs fixed. There should be no reason for a dog to be free unless it was irresponsible breeding and they need to get rid of them. You don't know the real reason why they are so cheap, the full medical history or anything like that. At least at shelters, I know mine does, we have each animal fully medically checked out before being able to be adopted and it's temperament is checked as well. What is the huge rush. Do your research and take your time finding the perfect dog.|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Try the local animal shelter|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	you cannot have a new born,, they have to be with mom for minimum of 2 months.    go to the shelters near you|`|3sGkmzOYaa	Go to a shelter, and adopt one. You better plan on spending up to $600 plus a year on this dog.|`|8KTr8n3kaa	Contact your local Humane Society or ASPCA. You can look them up in the yellow pages or online.|`|7x9lvbhAaa	i don't know i'm in south carolina try kijiji on yahoo|`|U1RcZjqJaa	Craigslist.com|`|ZNDqYUwkaa	Well, you need to get a puppy that's had time to learn from it's mother......8 weeks, preferably 12 weeks old.    You need to get a puppy because you have researched the breed, assessed your life and if you can honestly care for the dog and fulfill its needs and you need to learn A  LOT about dogs before you get one. It doesn't matter what breed you get or how small they are, if you don;t know how to properly care for, handle, train and raise a puppy, you will end up with a dog that has issues like barking, nipping, chewing, biting etc.    Don't get a puppy because it conforms to a list and if you have to be so careful about how much you have to buy one, not is not the time. Puppies are very expensive with all the vaccinations, puppy food, crates, beds, emergency vet care if needed etc.....the list goes on.    Please have a good think about if you can provide for a dog properly and then go and do your research on owning a dog and the different breeds.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	Anyone who would give you a puppy for free raises alarm bells for me. A registered breeder won;t give you one because if you aren't able to pay for a puppy, how are you going to pay for vet bills, vaccinations, good quality food? if you get one free from some BYBer you are risking an unhealthy puppy & that will cost you more $. Check with your local SPCA & tell them you are interested in adopting. They will not be free  but at least the puppy will have it's first or even 2nd set of shots, be checked over & healthy. You have no idea what breed you wnat to instead of asking on here, & getting 30 different answers, buy a dog book & research for yourself.(health, temperment, shedding,exercise requirements) A puppy needs to be with it's mother & littermates for 8 weeks & no responsible breeder will sell one before that.|`|s76aC4G8aa	to be honest you have not done your homework at all.  Being unprepared for a puppy will make the entire experience a nightmare for both you and the puppy.  No puppies are free, they cost money, even shelters cost money why?  Because dogs especially puppies are expensive, they require shots and booster shots and spaying and annual vet care not to mention food, toys, treats, collars, leashes, dog bowls, beds, and a whole host of stuff I can't even think of right now.    Most small dogs bark, yap, or have issues because they are so small, dogs bark because they are frustrated, bored, fearful or territorial, it's what they do, there is no such thing as a perfect pup, they grow up, they chew things, they bark, they have separation anxiety, they destroy your house, they can be aggressive and there isn't one dog that isn't loud unless you get a Basenji and even then they yodel.    Look on Petfinder.com or go to a local shelter and view small breed dogs, most dogs at the shelter are mixed breed, so you need to know the mix to figure out if it will even stay small once full grown.  You need to read up on housebreaking, crate training and general obedience.  You need to look to going to obedience classes when he gets old enough, you need to have enough money to take him in for booster shots at 9, 12 & 15 weeks of age and then get them spayed or neutered at 5 months of age.  You need to research food to find one that's right for your puppy.    You wouldn't have a baby without reading and learning all you can on how to care for it, so why be unprepared for a puppy?  It's a baby that potties outside, the worst thing you can do for this dog is be unprepared for it's arrival.    The website below should help you get started.    Good luck|`|P2yRAWiJaa	You can get a stuffed puppy for about $10 at WalMart.    that's the only kind of animal you need right now.    You can't get a "newborn" puppy anywhere. It's illegal. You must wait til they are 8 weeks old. All dogs bark at some point.  If you want one that doesn't bark a whole lot get a Basenji.  Wait, you want a small dog so that's out.|`|020573c2b8f6f31da5d9ac91c3b09ee6aa	you can't get a pup before it's 8 weeks old.  go to a shelter and tell them what you want in a dog. then ask them what you need for the dog.  for a small adoption fee, it'll have all it's shots and be altered. which will save you hundreds later.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	You have a lot to learn.     Puppies are only free from shelters, and NO ONE, not breeders, not anyone will be rehoming newborn ones. They need to be with their mother and littermates until at least 8 weeks of age.    Small breed dogs are chihuahuas, yorkies etc. Wouldn't recommend any small breed dog for a beginning. They're challenging; no dog comes friendly, playful and not loud - they are how you bring them up to be, like children.    All dogs need regular worming, flea treatment and vaccination, also neutering especially if it's a girl. Dogs are very expensive to keep even if they never get ill or injured. So only get one if you have plenty of spare cash.    Contact a vets to learn about dog care, do not learn it from on here!!!    Chalice|`|WKUGB4Hoaa	Perform a search for local shelters in your area.  Most will have a list of dogs with pictures.  Shelters will charge you about $50 to cover the cost of spaying or neutering.  Charges might be more or less depending on the area.  Chihuahuas seem to be good as small dogs go.  Their barks aren't that sharp as to blast your eardrums out and can be fine watch dogs.  Long haired ones seem less excitable than short haired and not quite as aggressive.  You must become the leader with any dog you get and not allow them to overstep your limits.   As far as supplies; with a small dog I assume it will be an inside dog.  A box or pet carrier is best for a new puppy.  Put in a few old towels and keep him/her in their until morning.  Give water and some food and then take her outside until she does her thing.  You will have to let her out every few hours until she becomes used to going out to take care of business.  Once she learns this she will either sit by the door or go to the door and bark.  Any good puppy food will do...most people in my area use IAMS.  Put a small handful in a bowl and moisten it with warm water.  Give her about 5 minutes to eat and then pick it up.  Always take her outside after she eats and again before going to bed.  Sure beats what you might get between your toes!|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	I think you better ask your parents.|`|DqUi0xPhaa	I am in NC go to the pound in greensboro www.adoptshelterpets.org    That way u know they are HW negative, have been spayed/neutered and vaccinated...check out their available pets they have some cute ones|`|63f286c18c955b4ec85ad28e39055b30aa	pound and if you can't afford to buy a puppy you can't afford to take care of one. I live in NC we have wake county animal shelter but im sure the fee is around 100 dollars|`|6zA0jR6Saa	most small bred puppies,  pure or not  will sell for well over $50.   Even shelter fees are usually more than that.  The kind of pup your looking for could be between $250-2,000.    You do know that dogs cost money.  Vet visits, food, supplies, grooming.......if your broke like you sound, don't get a dog,   they are a lot of responsibility and a lot of money|`|lx8UCLDTaa	The cheapest place to get a puppy or a dog is at the shelter and even then there is a fee of about $100. Puppies for free is scary. Chances are if someone is not makinga profit off of them there is something wrong with them which means high vet bills. Talk with your parents and look into adopting a puppy or dog. Most come spayed/neutered and with up to date shots, which will save you money. But, like others have said, puppies are expensive 9owning an animal in general is expensive). You still have food, training, vet bills and more to worry about.
csDhZDvraa	About 2-3 years a dogs body will reach its peak in growing.  11months is almost half way through, he still is going to have some 'filling out' to do as far as muscles and thickness goes.     At eleven months he should already be on adult food. ;)|`|L2Gi2tPmaa	Usually they are at their maximum of height at the age of 1 year and the 2nd year they usually fill out more.    When they are around a year old, you can start to switch to adult food.  Mix the puppy food with the adult food and slower decrease the amount of the puppy food until he is only eating the adult food.  Switching too fast can cause him to get the runs!|`|FewhKlx9aa	A dog can take 3yrs to reach full body size.I find this with their coats and size.I have German Sheperds and Pekingese and they are not fully grown..I had a Sheperd before that reached his 125lb body weight and size at 3 also..  With the food I like to start at 6mo's with switching them over as there is so much protein in puppy food it can lead to problems with the bones growing to quickly..I know vets will tell you different but I have raised dogs for 48 yrs.and this is what I found in the past compared to how I feed them now|`|FiFA3DNVaa	I find the larger the breed, the longer it takes for them to reach maturity. My Maltese was full grown at one year, my Great Dane is about 1 1/2 and still growing. I expect he'll grow until he's 3 years old. Yours could be the same case.

Puis tout un coup bam, c'est la ptite qui coure après la grosse et inversement.<br>  <br>  Bon des fois, ma grominette a pas envie et ca l'enerve de voir courrir la ptite, alors elle se lève et lui fout un baffe.<br>  <br>  Ca leur prend souvent le soir.|`|cfcecee85ab01ebbacac421b3f93b455aa	la mienne aussi en a, généralement à 2 heures du matin, c'est d'ailleurs pour ?a qu'elle n'a plus le droit de rester dans ma chambre la nuit (parce que le chat qui vous saute sur l'estomac à 2 heures du mat... je ne recommande pas !)... <br>  <br>  et comme je suis une femme horrible, de temps en temps, je la provoque : quand elle est tranquille en train de dormir, j'arrive par derrière et je lui fait tccchhhhhh ! dans les oreilles... et là ?a rate pas, elle part en trombe et elle se prend tous les meubles qui sont sur son passage...
SZOMVGBRaa	I'm sure if you google it online somebody has one for sale someplace BUT you won't be able to keep it alive. Jellyfish are for beyond expert fish keepers. They need custom made super special round tanks with all sorts of pumps and systems made just for them that you can't afford most likely. Although it would be cool, its not something that I think you want to do. Good Luck|`|Gta9wO3taa	My store can get them, but their tank could no problem cost a grand or two.|`|SOxdyWQOaa	I don't think you can
QVP8zSuWaa	WOW hats off to your Dad!!! I doubt they would do surgery until the heart worms are treated.   It think I would go with her to the vets and see what he says. Also I bet vets would give your Dad a discount if they know what he is doing.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	They will not operate on a dog that is HW positive and they wait about 6 months after the dog tests negative to do surgery.  Your dad sounds like a great guy!|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	euthanize.
AA12398420	With cats (like dogs) you have to spend some time training them. When they are scratching something they are not suppose to you either say in a firm tone "no" and/or give them a squirt of water. Or you when you catch them in the act go get them and use their paws to show how to scratch on the right things, like a scratching post. Afterward reward them and give them a treat. Make sure to make a big deal out of it by saying "good kitty". Like dogs they like to get praise.  If you are consistent the cat will learn that they get a negative reaction out of scratching inappropriately and they get goodies whenever they scratch on their toys.  Like dogs, you cannot expect them to know what is right and wrong. So she DOES NOT know, like you said, what she is doing wrong...it is up to you to show her. After a while they will catch on and if you do it right the cat will never scratch anything but the scratching post or cardboard again.    ADD: OMG! Please do not listen to MIKI...she is horrible with pets if she smacks them like she says. That is cruelty in my opinion. Never hit an animal it will only teach them one of two things...to fear you or they will defend themselves and attack you.|`|vl6OtBfWaa	This is a negative attention behavior just like a child your cat is bored and wants attention which it gets from you only when it does negative things pay more attention to him her scold her him when they do bad things praise her him when they do positive things stimulate the cat make its life interesting and full of attention and affection but always be the leader of the pack they are pack animals and you must have the respect of the pack or you will not be able to control your cats behavior.    We have 4 cats none are declawed (inhumane) and they have never ripped or torn our couches or curtains give them a place to scratch when they go to the railing discourage the negative behavior immediately show her him the scratching post positively encourage its usage praise the cat when they use it.  Persevere just like a child never say I give up.    Cats want discipline and boundaries in their lives it is in their genetic make up.|`|pXS9xa1Laa	I was going to say carpet with catnip but u already said that didnt work so what i would say id to get the carpets things and wrap them around the rails and doorways or anything she scratches. that way she will only have the option to use the carpeted toy than the dorway or rail. hope this helps!|`|Y32zA5Mfaa	If you haven't tried a water squirter, they work wonders.  Squirt her every time she does it, and that might work.  Or if that doesn't bother her, try a tin coffee can with coins in it.  Shake it hard every time she does it.    If you are having problems with her doing it while you are away, then there is a product called Soft Paws.  They are nail caps that you put on with nail glue over their claws.  They will eventually fall off, because the cat's claws will eventually shed the outer layer.  But you will only have to replace a claw cap once or twice a week--meaning only one claw will need replacing at a time (after you get the hang of putting them on properly).  I used these with a cat I had who kept attacking me in my sleep.  He still did it, but after putting the Soft Paws on, it didn't hurt anymore.  You can get them in almost any color too! (I had a black kitty with white paws, so I got black.  It looked pretty neat).|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Each individual cat seems to prefer a different type of surface when it comes to scratching.  Some like carpet, some like cardboard, some like sisal (which is like rope), and some like wood.  (well, usually, they like some combo of these).    It seems that your guy likes wood.  What I would try to do is provide him with something wooden he's allowed to scratch, and try to make this new scratching post more appealing than your doors and railings.  I built my own cat tree a while back, and I left some of its 2x4's as just plain uncovered wood, since one of my guys likes wood.  Also, consider getting a sisal rope scratching post - I think most cats like sisal the best.     During the process of building my cat tree I discovered that all my cats loved the texture of the plywood - it's kind of rougher since it's made of wood shavings all smooshed together - their claws "catch" on it very well.  Even if you just got some plywood and made a box out of it, or laid a piece of it against a wall (my guys loved the piece leaning at an angle on the wall), that might be all he needs!  I've also heard of people bringing an old tree stump or a thick branch into their house and cats seem to love the texture of the bark, too.  You'd probably want a freshly cut piece, though, since a lot of bugs live on old decaying stuff.|`|NmoFHWUraa	first off, if she is scratching on vertical objects, she needs a vertical cat scratch post, the ones horizontal on the floor won't attract her.  second, you need to be a disciplinarian with her, when she scratches the wrong place, you need to smack her rear-end and move her to the scratch post and encourage her to scratch there....it is harder to do with a grown cat though.  i have had many non-declawed cats that learn to use scratching posts with no problem.
R3E8DkTfaa	I'm not sure what kind of thing you have here, but unless the circulation pump is driving a filter of some sort, (i.e. an undergravel or submersible floss filter ) it isn't doing any good.  What you need is a filter of some sort, because just circulating dirty water won't accomplish anything except circulating dirty water.  If it is driving a filter, then it should be left on at all times, not turned on and off.  As for the bubbler they really do very little in a properly set up tank to help with oxygen levels, but they don't hurt either.  So if you like the way it looks then let it run 24 hours a day.  I wish I could  give you better advice, but without knowing more about what you have I am at a a loss for what to tell you.    Addition:  After reading the additional information that you posted, it is fairly clear that the second pump is driving the undergravel filter.  The air flow from this pump is what makes the filter operate.  You adsolutley must leave this pump running at all times in order for it to operate effectively.  I have never heard of a system such as you are describing, and would love to see a good picture of it.  If you have one or the ability to take one, you should post it for everyone to see.|`|4b127bdc65641a05881903d7090f19c2aa	I run my filter and my aerator 24 hours a day.  I don't know what kind of "circulation" you would need to run for only 20 minutes a day, but I hope you have a filter that you run more than that.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	Your aquarium system is pretty strange.  The fish need oxygen all the time.  I don't know what the "circulation" pump is connected to.  Usually filters also run all the time.   Both filters and air stones circulate the water, so this has me stumped.  Unless "circulation" actually makes a water *change* (removes old water and puts in new water from a spare tank or a water main).|`|85IYxj1kaa	ya handbooks are rubbish i used the pipe that was supposed to go to the air stone for my filter cause the filter also oxygenates the water?|`|GS9Bz0pAaa	The one with the oxygen stone on the end is the oxygen one I should think.. and yes we have ours on 24/7, Im not sure about circulation one? .. The oxygen pump doesnt actually put oxygen in the water it just disturbs the surface which in turn, makes the water absorb more oxygen or something along those lines lol    In our tank we just have the big main filter and the air stone one     xx|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Does this contraption have a name?    Oxygen comes from gas exchange at the waters surface, the air stones agitate the surface allowing that to happen, so that's the oxygen bit sorted and yes it runs 24/7.    Circulation one presumes is filtration. If it happened to be made in China translation isn't always accurate :o( That said no filter is only on 20 minutes per day. They are again 24/7.    There's no reason for a current if it's only on for 20 minutes. Actually I can't think of anything that only works for 20 minutes on a daily basis.    Edit: LOL - you were drunk when you bought that right? Change the water once per year - LOL    Thanks mate you have made my evening and I'm sure to win the lottery whether I put it on or not. This is mint :o) http://www.alibaba.com/member/uk10051149... Oh yeah and a pile of cr@p!
fWf3A3Ioaa	I think this is a misguided attempt at getting information on how to incubate and hand rear canaries under the false pretense that it is for a school project.    School projects almost always focus entirely on precocial species (birds that do not hatch blind and helpless).  I do not think your school would support the idea of you having to hand feed a canary for nearly a month.  This would mean you'd have to bring it to school with you.  School projects should be designed so that they can be carried out at home only.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	First off Its your project and you have to create the Hypothesis.  On top of that I am not sure how your going to incorporate a science fair project using live animals such as birds.     So you better think of a different project because you have not  done any  research you want people to give you answers and It's Your Project.    If your not willing to do the work then if I were you I would return the eggs from where you found them.|`|yYr412Vbaa	Cooool..that's awsum  google everything you need to know  don't be scared it's there to help..  umm no u give em to me when you're done  chirp|`|eXAEVCziaa	Hi, please check with your science teacher about this idea.  Your science teacher will help you understand why small bird eggs are NOT good for your project. And also help you pick a good choice if you want to stay with incubating eggs as part of your project.  Best wishes, Jay
JFuVm9k5aa	go to schneiders. alot of their blnkets are specifically made for arabs (they also focus around saddle seat type riding and horses....mainly arabs and saddlebreds) i worked and boarded my horse at a very well known saddle seat barn who had over 80 arabs and saddlebreds and the barn owner had all the owners buy schneiders blankets for their horses. they fit them all REALLY WELL and while i was there not one got ripped or rubbed any of the horses. because of how well they seemed to fit all 80 of those horses i decided to give them a try and got them for my QH, oldenburg, hanoverian, TB, and holsteiner and they all fit them GREAT. really good prices too. for each of my horses to get a stable sheet, a medium stable blanket, a heavy stable blanket, a turnout sheet, a medium turnout, and a heavy turn out and a hood each i paid less than a grand. for 24 blankets and 4 hoods!!!      and not one has ripped and these blankets get aot of use....18 hours a of turnout with a yearling wearing them and doing everythign possible to get them off!!!   here is the link...,,    http://www.sstack.com/jump.jsp?itemType=...       mine wear the dure-tech turnouts and i forgot the name of their stable blankets....      ::EDIT::  i think the dura tech turnouts are about $70...1200 denier too    ::EDIT2::  i have only had one experience with a saxon blanket and it was ripped within a few hours of t/o in a group. it was not my horse or my blanket but a friend. i'm not sure if it was 1200 denier though...it seems pretty durable buy looking at it. she also said (i just talked to her about it) theat it was not 100% water proof her horse ended up wet after a few good rains. she also said (bare with me i cant explain this well) that the second layer (the outer layer is "water proof" and then i guess hers had cotton under) and the top layer were like...seperating and bunching up under her horse? she also said it "sagged" in the hind end on her not fo full TB and it did not have a good drop. i didnt read the details about the saxon you were looking at but for 100 just go for a weatherbeeta!  p.s. the schneiders blankets will not let you down. if i have 24 blankets and not one has rubbed/ripped/soaked through/or anything like that i can assure you you will be happy.  i also have a few RAMBO blankets and my schneiders actually fit better than thay do and my horses seem to like themm more. so if a $70 blanket beats a $400 blanket it must be pretty good ;)|`|GB8fSTw8aa	You say he is in good flesh now, so I think he would be okay without a blanket if he can get under a shelter in wet conditions, he should be okay, as long as he is not wet when it is cold outside, my experience is that they have no problems staying warm as long as they do not get wet in the cold, they will stay outside most of the time if they have the choice, even if they have no blanket on them|`|YwMO1txAaa	Hi, I own three pure breds and they are all wrapped up like cotton wool!  I find that the best rugs personally are schneiders - if you google they should come up with a website.  Think it is www.sstack.com.  They are brillant and don't rub. They are designed for the pure bred so are cut back at the front, you can either have an over the head (without any front buckles) or if your arabian is a little nervous then you can have the traditional buckle front.  There is a wide choice, all with leg straps which are detatchable and even have cross over surcingles or belly bands which I really like.  You can buy detatchable hoods as well.  They are available in a range of sizes and colours.  Good Luck  Tracey|`|Chxoncy7aa	I have a garage full of Arabian size blankets.  I'm in CT.  Are you near me?  I think I have a brand new 72".  I would give it to you if we are close enough.  It's great you rescued this horse.  Arabs are my breed!|`|ajj7ATyAaa	The blankets sstack.com sells usually fit arabs quite nicely.|`|T1kRNoxCaa	try state line tack|`|Vh4HpFPdaa	...not under 100 dollars, unless maybe you find one used on ebay.    When it comes to blankets you really do get what you pay for.    A weatherbeeta is going to set you back about 200 bucks, but it'll be worth it. I've had the one for 4 years now.     Just remember to check the denier. Just because it says it's waterproof doesn't mean it's waterproof enough. 600 denier is technically waterproof... but it's not going to keep your horse dry. You need to look for something above 1000 denier.    Weatherbeeta and Pessoa are nice brands. I've got some Kensington blankets, and I don't like them as much. They have no shape, and they're more easily damaged.     If you can't afford a weatherbeeta look for a Saxon, it's weatherbeeta's less expensive brand.
bEQn0Vrtaa	Some guineas just do not like to have their hind quarters rubbed, i really don't know why but they just don't. I have had many companion guinea pigs and i would say that about 1/3rd of them did not enjoy having their hind quarters rubbed. Non of them like you touching them on their grease gland which sets right on top of the spine  at the point the tail comes out. You need to watch it to make sure it does not become impacted, i am guessing that yours may be and that is why it is so touchy If it is impacted you must clean it. Take him into the bathroom and set the water so it just feels warm to you. lie the guinea in your hand with his body up along your arm so it is fully supported and talk to it softly, Mine all responded to  the words your are safe. run the water, a gentle stream over the guinea for a bit so it is nice and wet and soap it with a baby shampoo or some mild soap and gently scrub on the oil gland until you get all the hair out of it and the gunk off of it. make sure all the soap is off of it and dry well. Hopefully that will help|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	Its normal.|`|yvWI1u28aa	They often do that if they've got sensetive skin, often caused by something like mid mange or mites. Check to see if theres and flaky skin, scabby patches or if theres a white patch on him, check the hairs thoroughly for grey blobs on them- thats lice. If you find something like that, you can buy mite shampoo for about 5, or ivectemin squirty things (a vet will give him an ivectamin injection, but theres no need if you sort it out =]) for 8 for a pack of 4 for piggies over 500g. For mange you'll need to get your piggie to the vets (loose flaky skin, raw skin, scabby areas- it looks terrible and can happen over night!) the vet will give them antibiotics and usually a special wash to soothe the skin =)    xx|`|5BV5vLRFaa	Yep, it's normal.  Mine did it all the time.  Now when you rub it's back is it like a shaky purr type sound....not quite a full squeak, but more like a purr?  Mine would do that when you rubbed her back in a certain spot and it means they are happy.      If he's in pain, you should be able to tell by his quick, loud squeak.  Just like if a dog or cat is in pain, you kinda just know by the way they react.  They will squeak whenever they think that you are going to pick them up, too.  So if you haven't been petting him and then go just to rub his back, he might think that you're trying to catch him.|`|nhVLNeXHaa	Slap it and tell it to suck up, and tell it that he's an embrassment to guiena pigs everywhere. Mwa haha...|`|gUxHXhjTaa	Give it something to whine about, that will teach um. lol|`|YZYhgvA7aa	This is normal. But if your worried ring a vet and get advice.|`|M06c7GU6aa	Guinea pigs do not like to be touched near their rump, it is very sensitive and uncomfortable for them. Actualy, when they are sorting out dominance with another piggy, another piggy may try to mount him, and that's where their front paws would go. So no pig enjoys being touched there.    What you do is just stop petting them there and bothering him like that. Instead, stick to giving him some scratches under the chin and ears. Avoid petting his rump area.
pXS9xa1Laa	i'm not really sure why he is screaming, but if he is only a month old he should still be drinking milk not hard food, that could be the screaming cause it may hurt for him to go and could be the cause of diahrea. if this persists then i would take him to the vet and see what they say but first u can buy kitten milk in store like walmart and petco and bottles to feed the kitten, one month is far to young for hard food or even canned food. keep the kitten on a schedule to for when it eats. try switching to hard/canned kitten food around two months. hes probably in pain, but if you try this and it does not work go to the vet because he may have an infection or something serious|`|vl6OtBfWaa	I think if he has liquid poo for a while his bum probably burns when pooping just like a people.  If he is only a month old maybe you should be giving him cat milk instead of food.  They sell it in little juice box containers at pet stores.    If he is having normal bowel movements and still goes to poop when he needs it I do not think it is any internal problem food change and (this is a funny one )  moisturize bum like a baby???  I don't know about that one just thought the picture was funny.    Good Luck
w1lh1INHaa	A good worming treatment should be at least a two week deal -- one treatment and then another two weeks later.  Because of the life cycle of worms, one treatment only deals with the live ones, and not the eggs or larvae.    So yes, your cat can have worms.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I'd take her back to the vet.  The meds should work if you had her wormed in January and its only a month.  As long as she is not outside and you don't have fleas, she should not have worms.    Any kittens I've had worms were only wormed once with no further problems.|`|fIsjIMZHaa	worming kills what she already had if shes an outdoor cat she could have picked up worms between then and now.|`|V8uvefQDaa	Take her to the Vet. It maybe that she needs a stronger treatment.    x|`|FvAl3UgQaa	Absolutely! How you worm them, and with what, makes a huge difference.     If you're using pet store or supermarket dewormers, they're pretty useless anyway.     If you're getting her worming meds from the vet, there's a good chance that you need a change of drug, as the parasites can build up a resistance to particular dewormers.     Also, if you're giving a single dose dewormer each time, chances are that the unhatched eggs are getting missed (unless you're using one that can kill eggs too) and if that's the case, they'll hatch in between doses.|`|DutTBV3caa	yes she can. i worm my cat about once every other month. does your cat have fleas? worms are caused by the cat eating fleas or flea eggs. i cant remember which one it is.|`|7ciw1aCXaa	Get some proper worming meds from the vet. One of ours persistently had worms until the woman who owned his mother moved away and he stopped going round their house eating their food. Even with the strongest medication the vet could give us!|`|iIGOi2Idaa	If you're using stuff from the vets every three months and she's an indoor cat, I would say it's unlikely. Get some of the stuff by her bottom(gross I know) and show it to a vet, or just show the cat's bottom to the vet!    The only thing I would say is if she's not being flea treated also with stuff from the vets, she could well still have fleas, being an indoor cat does not protect against this as you probably know. Fleas transmit tapeworm, which are the ones that appear as little 'rice grains' around the bottom.    End of the day, no one on here can say they are or aren't worms because we haven't seen them.    Chalice|`|AA10726599	wormers you buy at a pet store etc are fine for roundworms. There are other worms such as tape worms and others that take different medicines. It sounds like you may be seeing a tape worm segment, flat white like a grain of rice? a vet can do a fecal exam to find the microscopic parasites and tapeworms.|`|723qR6p8aa	Hmm i dont know how she could have them as she has been wormed in Jan it doesn't seem correct! I know they get them if they have flea's but she is treated for that aswell. She hasn't been out in a while either so thats even more confusing! I would phone the vet and ask them. But i think to be on the safe side to treat her for worms again.   Mwah/.x|`|OgQOVsxPaa	Yes, they can get worms still.    Make sure she is not eating any pork, pork gives cats worms.  Do you have a cat flap, if you do she may have been out without you knowing.    You never know, just get her treated again.   Best of luck to you and your kitty :)
Eyawiwc5aa	Did you ever take them to a herp/reptile vet to have looked over???? Many pet store igs can be sick and the pet stores will sell them anyways.  What were you feeding?  What type of living space?  What type of UVB/heat where you offering?  What was the temps?  What type of floor covering where you offering?    Basic care info for iguanas:    Young iguana (8-10 months of age) should not live in anything smaller the a 55 gallon tank. Smaller the tank you can not process the correct temps threw out. Enclosure needs to be at least 1.5-2 times it's total length ... an adult you will need a space of 6-7ft tall x 8-10ft long x 4ft wide.  Temps:  never let drop below 70F ...  basking 92-96F if temp is too low digestion is slowed too high food digests too fast and nutrition is lost  medium/middle (overall) 88-92F  cool 75-84F  at night 73-84F ... having a temp gun works the best to know what your igs body temp truly is.  *** NO HEAT ROCKS PLEASE ... they can cause major burns on the under belly ... igs dont feel heat from below so they will sit there not knowing they are burning themselves ***  - Depending on enclosure size, depends on wattage, but for basking light (along w/ UVB tube) you can use a house bulb for heat during the day, you don't have to use one of those costly basking bulbs you buy at the store (night if your house gets below 70 a CHE should be used - produces heat no light)  - Stick on glass thermometers do not work, they can read incorrect, get a good thermometer w/ a probe at the end, and place where your iguana is basking under and at his/her level, you will get more of a correct temp reading  Humidity:  Iguanas are tropical and do need humidity. Spraying/Misting a few times a day will help some, silk fake leaves (bigger then your igs head) will help hold some humidity, having a humidifier or vaporizer next to the tank will help (figure out a way to pipe inside would be better but think child proof also), daily baths will help and learn to go potty in the tub less mess in tank.  UVB: (12 hrs on during day - 12 hrs off during night no light)  US: ReptiSun 10.0 distance 8-10 inches from your igs body  Repti Glo 8.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  ReptiSun 5.0 distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  UK: Arkadia distance 6-8 inches from your igs body  - You will need to adjust the distance as your ig grows  - Using a shop light from a home improvement store works the best, get one that has 2 tube plugs and using 2 UVB tubes  - The UVB listed are in tube form, using the 36-48inch tubes are the best more length for your ig  - Surface under the UVB tube lights need to be a flat surface if at an angle your igs body will not get the proper UVB threw out. You also need to change the UVB tubes listed above every 6months  - There are UVB's out there on the market now that can cause eye damange to your ig (do not use the compact or the coil type - see the uvguide.co.uk for further information)  - W/out UVB your ig may end up w/ MBD (Metabolic Bone Disease)  - UVB information that you may find interesting:  http://www.uvguide.co.uk  Floor covering:  BAD floor covering: bark, dirt, moss, sand, pellets are all bad ... at some point your iguana will try and lick swallow and then possibly cause blockage which will then need to be surgically removed or possibly death ... SAFE floor covering: newspaper (unprinted), paper towels, towels, vinyl flooring, indoor/outdoor carpeting - if you have any lose fibers from the carpeting or the towels please remove and replace - unprinted newspaper if you possibly can use is safer just in case your ig likes to try and eat the newspaper some ink may contain soy  Food:  Daily food should have 5-7 good staple greens (2-3 cups a day if not more younger igs may eat less then 1/4 cup) ... collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, dandelion greens (if you can find), endive, radicchio, arugula, mache (if you can find), watercress ... some greens to give occasionally kale, bok choy, escarole ... adding basil for young igs sometimes helps them eat ... romaine is mostly water no nutrience, you can add small amount and occasionally in w/ the good staple greens (collard, mustard, etc) but do not make romaine just your iguanas choice of greens (or any other type of lettuce most of us humans eat) ... some things to add (small amounts) snap peas, bell peppers (every now and then), parsnip, sweet potato/yam, acorn squash, butternut squash, buttercup squash ... fruits should only be given every now and then once or twice a week type of thing fruits are like junk food to iguanas ... some fruits to try papay, kiwi, mango, raspberries, strawberries, grapes, honeydew (great water source), canalope (great water source), 12 grain wheat bread ... if anything has seeds make sure you remove seed before you give it to your iguana anything w/ small seeds like strawberries wait like 3 days before giving anymore ... watermelon (seedless) can be frozen and then shaved onto your iguanas food helps w/ hydration everyday ... there are some foods that aren't good for your iguana: spinach has oxalate acids bind to the calcium, so even though spinach is high in calcium, almost none is actually available for the iguana to use, also the oxalate acids can form oxalate crystals which can and do build up in the kidneys causing kidney damage/failure ... some ig owners do give there ig spinach but in very small amounts and only once a month ... corn igs can not digest ... carrots can block calcium absorption ... bananas are low in calcium best to give another type of fruit ... apples too much acid - appetite suppressant ... rhubarb is poisonous ... food should be cut/chopped/diced no bigger then the iguanas head, if they are small having a chopper chop them up, or slice them into very small pi|`|uo2sGuvWaa	The most common cause for deaths in Iguanas is due to improper care so you probably did not have the right set up, heating and lighting. Iguanas are not a beginner lizard and they get very big and have aggressive streaks and need very specific care. I suggest you should start off with something easier like a Leopard Gecko or a Bearded Dragon but if you don't want one of them and still would like an Ig do a lot of research before getting another one. I also suggest not going to the same store in case their animals are sick and next time if it is not doing well take it to see a reptile vet.    Here is a great website, it has everything you need to know about Igs. http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html    I wish you luck with your next lizard.    Here is a short care sheet.    Diet-(high in calcium, low in phosphorus)  45% leafy greens such as collards, mustards, dandelion, kale. NO lettuces or spinach.  45% hard vegetables such as orange flesh squash(butternut, spaghetti,acorn pumpkin), fresh green beans, fresh peas, green bell peppers, parsnips.No Broccoli.  10% fruit such as figs, mangoes, papaya, pears.  Do not feed animal protein and commercial Iguana food it is very unhealthy.    Lighting-  They need a UV light(ex. reptisun 5.0 or greater I use 10.0) They need to be changed every 6-8 months.    Heat-  Basking spot 90 degrees F the rest of the tank should be 75-80. Get a digital thermometer to measure the temperatures.    They need humidity so you should spray them few times per day. You should also give it a bath every other day in warm water.    This website has everything you need to know about Igs.    http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/|`|NzSA6dmyaa	u probably dont have the correct heating lighting or set-up for them or are getting them from sick badly treated imported wild caught places. i wouldnt get anymore till u figure out why they keep dieing. have a look at this website http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/|`|lWDsDG02aa	Ask the place where you bought them if they have had that problem with any of the others they have sold. It may not be your fault. You might buy the next one from a different place. You may be buying unhealthy ones to start with. Good Luck
vl6OtBfWaa	He is still young enough to remember the pleasure of getting milk from his mother you have replaced her and he feels comfortable enough with you to try and nurse from you.   The behavior will stop when he feels like the milk is never coming back and he no longer needs that familiar kitten feeling.|`|pXS9xa1Laa	yes its very normal for kittens to do that. kittens like to bite and lick fingers because it reminds them or when they were feeding off their mothers nipples. this should stop after about 6-8 months. also, it is a playful thing that kittens will do when they are young. hope this helps!!!|`|DutTBV3caa	my cat does that whenever she feels like i'm not giving her enough attention. she also does it when i'm petting her and she doesn't want me to stop.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Sure it's normal, kitties like the taste and smell of things, including us. My 9 month old kitty still loooves chewing my fingers - probably because I encourage it!!    Chalice|`|HlujNBdhaa	It is a sign of affection.  Similar to nursing, it is an attachment.  Baby loves you!  Kind of like a 'love bite'!|`|prW1i0vzaa	This is a way of cats trying to get your attention. Don't worry; It's perfectly normal.|`|FlsrXuJOaa	both of my cats do this. they are playing! When they lick you, it is like when they groom themselves or each other. it means you are part of their group and they love you. :)|`|xUtvpHU2aa	Yes this is normal. 2 reasons. 1: He loves you and he's so used to you he always wants to be with you. And 2: You have a certain smell or animal smell on you fingers that he likes.Hope you like my idea and  please rate!
enC9TvxUaa	-You mean beak, I presume.  NO you cannot trim this yourself.  This MUST be done at a qualified Avian vets office, if at all!|`|EJpiaCMQaa	Don't try to trim the beak yourself.  You could seriously injure your parakeet.  A vet needs to trim the bird's beak if it's too long.  If your parakeet's beak curls way under, then it's best to take it to a vet for a trim.  In addition, I suggest trying flavored cuttlebones, like orange or vanilla, to encourage your bird to use its cuttlebone.  My parakeets love the flavored ones.  You can also buy a mineral block to help keep the bird's beak trimmed.|`|ihbPQUjhaa	Yes definitely take him to the vet to get it fixed. Is the beak kinda soft? A large soft beak could also mean fatty liver disease. Hope your little guys gonna be ok.|`|C6wO9ixpaa	My parakeets did the same thing when I got them. Their beaks started to get pretty long. I moved the cuttlebone all over the place trying to get them to use it. I finally put it basically ON their perch, wired to the outside bar and it worked! Beaks are great now and bone is being used.|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	Cement and sandy perches are sometimes fun for birds to chew on a bit and get their beaks trimmed down in a more natural way (since they chew a lot in the wild and get the same result). You can also try cuttlebone perches, sometimes they are more fun for a parakeet. You could also put rocks and other things into the food dish so your parakeet has to move the objects around to get to his food, making that beak work harder. The safest route is to go to a professional for a healthy and safe beak trimming and try the other things afterwords to keep it trimmed down. More info on these trimming tools: http://jamiesparrothelp.wordpress.com/20...|`|0mGNwzwhaa	Take him to a bird vet or local bird store and have them trim it.  It's very important it is not cut too short, or left too long.  It affects the way they can feed and also how they get around|`|e46e0f67f9db3b8dfa4cae1be74a6448aa	Cuttlebone is used as a calcium source for birds, not for beak maintains as it is soft and ingested by the bird.  Sometimes parakeets can have this beak overgrowth problem and it is NOT recommended that you do it yourself. If you clip too far, your bird will experience extreme pain and will bleed to death in a short period of time. The beak is a very sensitive part of their body and circulates fluid and blood. Your bird will need to go to a bird shop or a veterinarian that knows how to trim beaks.
uo2sGuvWaa	I have no problem with people smoking weed but when they use it on animals that is cruel so I really hope you are kidding. If weed is inhaled but animals it causes them to develop respiratory infections. I'm not sure what it does if it is eaten but I'm sure it isn't good for them considering it is not part of their diets and will probably make them sick.|`|ph4Htg02aa	They float on cloud 9.|`|5919d59a9a07aac4e14c50ba4d7d46b9aa	LOL they grow long fangs, foam at the mouth and eat your face off!|`|b2Cr9E5Gaa	Dont feed your hamster weed, grow up and be a responsible pet owner, to much could possibly kill him, and the weed might not have the same affect it has on humans, weed could be poison to them.  Giving your pet a drug for your own entertainment purposes is cruel , it wont be very funny when he starts convulsing    its really not funny, dont you really not have anything better to do with your time? theres tons of online game websites, or better yet , sit yourself down and write yourself a  big long story about hampsters and weed.
b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	your hunting dog isn't being allowed to hunt,,, he is bored|`|VXcp8hvHaa	I've been looking for a dog like that, where could I get one?|`|Glarnx6Taa	I suggest you get him trained, that worked for us, Good luck|`|y1T1P9zGaa	Well since he's only one means he is probably still in his teething stage u might try giving him some rubber toys or a bone to keep him busy  I have a dog and when he was around that age he loved chewing on things so we just gave him something to chew on  also when he goes towards your bike tell him "no" in a firm tone so he knows he isn't supposed to go there and praise him when he obeys you  give him lots of attention keep him active and maybe you could find a different place for your bike too    good luck :)
0sJsTN83aa	I would get at least 3 different Vet opinions before going forward with this surgery.  If it's a puppy I would defiantly wait until its adulthood to see if the condition is unlivable.  Many Yorkie's have leg issues that don't seriously affect them.  But you'd be looking at $1,500-3,000 easily for the surgery, and if the poor dog dies in surgery (which happens frequently) you will still have to pay.  My aunts Yorkie had no knees in the back and learned to get along just fine.    Where did you get the dog?  If it was a breeder who gave you a contract they might cover it - the same may be true if it was a Petland type place so read any paperwork you signed carefully.  But also be aware that no one is likely to pay, as all contracts have clauses that they will either a) replace the dog or b) replace the value of the dog, no one will pay for this surgery in most instances because it's too expensive.  You will be asked to surrender the dog for another dog, or a monetary value of the dog, and the dog will be put to sleep more than likely.  It's very sad, but it is the honest business that goes with animal rearing and is required to keep from going bankrupt.  However, if there's no paperwork, it will be out of pocket.|`|vPde97E2aa	95%+++ of bad knees do *NOT* require surgery.|`|FewhKlx9aa	It has got to be in the range of $1500-$2000 as this is cheaper than what I paid for hip replacements and cervical surgery..I do have a shih tzu with this in the hind legs and he ia now 6yrs. old..He has no complications and does'nt cry with it..He runs and plays with the rest of them..But if your dog is in pain then yes surgery required but do contact the breeder..But with most all they will say is trade for another dog and how can you do that as you become attacted and they know this..Get the word out about the breeder/puppy mill so no one else buys a pup from them|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	luxating patella?    2000. dollar range    ** contact your breeder,, this is an inherited trait    FYI:      Luxating Patellas or LP in Yorkies    Patellar luxations (dislocation of the knee-cap) occur frequently in Yorkies and other dogs and rarely in cats. Patellar luxations can he grouped into two main categories. Congenital (existing from birth). And those often resulting from trauma and can affect any pet. Lameness occurs as the patella luxates and often resolves when it spontaneously reduces. Lameness is often intern-intermittent and animals will learn to reduce the patella themselves by extending the hip and the knee together behind them. Diagnosis is made on physical examination and may be confirmed with radiographs. Radiographs will demonstrate the patella luxation if the patella is dislocated -at the time the radiographs are taken. All animals with patellar luxation can develop some degree of arthritis.     The patella normally moves up and down in a groove in the lower femur bone called the trochlear groove. In patella luxation the groove is often shallow. This shallow groove prevents the patella from seating deeply and predisposes it to dislocation. This results in the luxation of the patella as the leg is used. The quadriceps or extensor muscles of the leg are associated with the patella. In patellar luxation, the extensor muscles are often maligned to the inside or outside of the leg, The degree of patella luxation is graded from I to IV depending on the relative ease with which the patella luxates.     Grade I is the mildest and grade IV the most severe.  Grade I and II patellar luxations may be completely asymptomatic and may be incidental findings in mature dogs who have never been lame. These grades should rarely require surgery.  Grade III and IV luxations are usually lame. A great deal of Grade lV's will require surgery.     Surgical Correction  The decision to perform surgery on animals with patellar luxations is based on many factors including the degree of lameness, the grade of patellar luxation, the age of the animal, and the presence of concurrent problems with the knee. In most situations the dog lives an entirely normal life. Just like most people whose knees are not the best either.     Patellar luxation may also be found in conjunction with other injuries to the knee which require surgery, most commonly, rupture of the cranial cruciate ligament. Often the surgeon will discuss correction of the patellar luxation at the same time the other injury is repaired.     Many toy dogs live their whole lives with luxating patellas and are never lame. A "luxating patella" also referred to as a "trick knee" which can move out of place if injured by jumping off furniture or walking in a hole in the ground, or something similiar. Toy dogs can be prone to this because of their small size. No matter how firm the knees seem as puppies, toy dogs are liable to injure their knees depending on the degree of luxation. The grooves in the knee where the knee fits is sometimes shallow and the knees can be very wobbly. The taller more fine-boned dogs seem to be more prone to this kind of injury.     If you are one that lets your dog jump off and on furniture, provide them a stool to get up and down from to prevent as much trama constantly happening to those knees.|`|Ee2fwrqoaa	IDK.  Your dog's breeder should pay for part of it as stated in your health guarantee.|`|FiFA3DNVaa	I've seen them go from $1700 to $2100, depending on the vet. A client of mine took her yorkie to Vegas (two hours from home) and paid $2000|`|RNqHUNgEaa	About $2000.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	Prices for anything vary greatly from country to country, area to area and vet to vet, especially for operations. Just ring around your local vets for quick quotes.    You will never find useful estimates for prices on this site, not even ballpark figures a lot of the time - for instance, the first answerer said 2 grand - we charge 600 max for that, see what I mean?
