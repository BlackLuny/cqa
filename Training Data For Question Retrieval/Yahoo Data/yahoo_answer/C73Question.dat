He works pipeline in Oklahoma so he would gt off on friday, drive there, and leave on the following monday. Now, his job is telling him he has to work fridays and be back on monday- even when he has drill 10 hours away over the weekend?! He is so tired right now and needs some information to give to his employers showing what the regulations state on how much rest he should be allowed. He almost fell alseep at the wheel on the drive up there yesterday. If you have any information on where I can look at the right regulations, please let me know. And also, if you wonder why he is not yet able to do drill in oklahoma, we had alot of  family ordeals that happened after he signed the contract kind of meaning we need to stay here now instead of living in illinois but now he will be trying for split drill.

WE buy the drugs that pay for all their guns etc. Which means: You can't fight a war that will eradicate America's addiction to illegal drugs.      So if we're going to buy the drugs regardless, why not legalize them to bring down the price (and subsequently the profits one can make selling them)??      The alternative to legalization would be an armed conflict with Mexican drug cartels (who would still be selling drugs to American citizens and making HUGE profits).........meaning an actual "war" with cartels would be as effective as the U.S. War on Drugs---it won't work.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090307/pl_...

20090307192839AATi9Kz	Politics & Government;Politics	Do you feel the "bad mortgages" is the real problem or something they are not telling us?	This loaning to bad debt people started under Clinton and George let it ride.  They have the statistics of the percentage of the home owners that will default on the loan.  Like in the auto industry bad risk people let over 60% of the cars go back.  Same way the insurance company operates on statistics.      So a person moves into a home, has a mortgage, water bill, Electric, phone and then also property taxes, which are not small.  before these folks might have had to worry about electric or apartment rent or phone bill.       So my point is they have the statistics for over 10-11 or more years and all these people just didn't "punt" on their homes, it been going on since it started and it's a certain amount.  So is there something else other than the bad debt smoke and mirrors they are throwing at us.      There should be a site that has the actual numbers that default and the amount.  I wonder if like Madoff, Stanford and others if there is a bigger problem they don't want to address that involves $70 trillion in loans between the financial people.  This housing thing is not new.        What do you think it could be.

20090307194907AA7UQ5V	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do people say communism has killed millions, when it really hasn't?	Considering that communism has never existed, this makes no sense. The USSR and the Soviet bloc were not communist, in any respect. Same goes for Cuba, North Korea, etc.       When I make a legitimate post, opponents often claim horrible crimes that "communist" countries have committed. But under communism, people would not be purged for disagreement. There would not be a cult of personality. There would be no elite class because there would be no classes. Communism is a worldwide movement where all people would be united equally and treated without discrimination.       So I do not understand why people say this. I could just as easily quote the number of deaths capitalism has taken, which is far more than all these "communist" countries combined.

I am watching the movie "Stop Loss"  and that's sort of the whole plot line.... decorated war hero comes home from fighting in Iraq, gets awards, honored as a hero, etc.  Then a couple days later is his ETS date and he goes in to do so and they tell him he has been stop-lossed under order of the president.  I was under the impression that stop-loss could only been done during an actually war.  Has this policy changed?  Is this movie based on thruth?  Do they really do this to our soldiers nowadays?

It's what made the U.S the most prosperous nation in the world. Capitalism represents the very American dream to better yourself and your life. Capitalism is freedom from tyrannical government. How can you not like that? I'll admit, there has been corruption and capitalism has been abused in some cases, but corruption will exist in any system. What we need is more ethical oversight. Socialism is not the answer. I think most of you will agree with me that government is incompetent, inefficient, and in many cases unethical. So why the hell would you want them to get more control of the economy and the money supply? It's simply not rational. We must make a stand.

Hello      I came to the US with J1 visa about 1.5 years ago and my j1 visa was about to expire I returned to my home country on time. On my J1 visa I have "Two year rule does apply" phrase. As far as I know, If I don't stay in my home country 2 years, I am not allowed to apply for an another visa. At the moment I am planning to do MBA, but because of that 2 years rule it seems I have to wait 1 more year.      My question is when I apply for F1 visa, the above mentioned 2 years rule be valid on F1 visa, too? Basically, can I apply for F1 visa without having problem?      I really appreciate your answers.

Put the amount that is usually taken out of your pay on the side just in case you do owe something the following year. I think this is the smart thing to do considering so many people count on their tax refunds. This is more then likely going to spread to many other states next year concerning the IOU's

They have declared Martial Law under the pretenses that things are so messed up that only the military of Mexico and the US can do something about it.        Obviously, this is probably crap.  I believe that this is an opportunity to test Martial Law in a larger-scale.  I just refuse to believe that there has never been violence of this magnitude involving the police/military and the cartels in Mexico along with the fact that drug smuggling from Mexico has been going on forever.      I also believe that they are trying to broaden what the definition of a terrorist is.  It seems to me that they have altered this each and every year and now anyone caught with cocaine, marijuana or methamphetamine will be supporting "terrorists."        This whole situation all seems shady.      Any answer that has facts that are posted on the MSM will be disregarded.

It seems to Don Mashak that USA voters need to stop thinking Republican vs. Democrat and start thinking "Common Voter" vs. "Corrupt Politician"        Don Mashak suggests that we all just ask ourselves one question when voting from now on:  Am I happy with where I am and where the country is going.        If you are happy vote them all back in regardless of party because they are the ones that got us here.  If you are not happy, vote them all out regardless of political party because they are the ones that got us here.  The parties system allows them to divert our attention to issues like abortion and gun control while they steal us blind.        Vote your  happiness, No amount of money the Plutocrats spend on campaign contributions, lobbyists, advertising or bribes to elected officials can alter the election if we all just vote based on our happiness with the results of their last term.        And soon, instead of being beholding to who can get the most money to them, they will be beholding an agenda that makes the majority of the voters want to reelect them.      IF YOU KEEP DOING WHAT YOU HAVE ALWAYS DONE, YOU WILL KEEP GETTING WHAT YOU ALWAYS GOT!

It's either "he's only been president a few months" or "with the mess that Bush left him, what do you expect"?      First of all: OBAMA is the president now.      Secondly: BUSH is not the president.      Did Bush exacerbate an already festering financial problem?? YES      Is Obama helping to undo some of those mistakes?? NO      BOTH INCREASED THE SIZE OF THE GOVT.........BOTH INCREASED THE DEFICIT..........BOTH ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO LET SOLDIERS DIE IN POORLY DEFINED CONFLICTS.      Obama's ACTIONS speak louder than his words, and he's done plenty...
20090307213227AAMabB8	Politics & Government;Immigration	Must I know the language if I move to a foreign country where people can, but usually don't speak English?	First things first, I'm an American in her junior year of high school.  But here's the deal:      I plan on attending the University of Manchester in Britain to study anthropology/archaeology.  I'll =start learning Arabic there and perhaps study abroad in Lebanon, Jordan or India.  After that, I'm open to go anywhere in the world for work (I'm not picky), but I'd prefer to be based in either Spain or Germany.  I speak Spanish well already, so Spain would be an easy enough transition, but I've always dreamed of living in Germany.  For my entire life it's the only place I've ever really wanted to live.  But because my high school didn't offer German, I took Spanish instead.  I know that almost everybody in Germany speaks English anyway, but I don't want to seem like that rude American who thinks the whole world should speak English.      Should I consider Spain more than Germany, even though I'd much prefer Germany?      All of this is according to whether or not my life plans work out, of course.  =P

There was absolutely no outrage from Republicans on here when Bush gave all that money out and McCain voted on it, a bill full of pork, the same one he said he was against.

Shelves of Wal-marts going empty overnight? DJA dropping 50%? Mass panic?       http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woo...       "The liberal economic system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike national economies, however, the international economy lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but the architects of Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, they set up a system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency."

I just recently heard some customers of mine in my store talking about a website today called www.godhatesfags.com. They were pretty offended that a church (of all places) would be spreading hate messages in such an explicit, vulgar manner. I went to the site today and also found the website to be highly offensive. I have nothing against gay people and I don't believe in gay marriage, but some of the things that church is saying, the way they refer to gay/lesbian people as "fags, queers, etc," are religious extremists, and just plain disrespectful (They have a picture of some one stepping on an American Flag on their site.) I mean, come on. If you hate those views so much and hate America so much just move to another country that is obsessed with God and like to twist the words of love and wisdom that God teaches, not blatant hate like they are spreading.      It's okay if the website stays, I would just like it to be a little less offensive and vulgar. I'm sure Jesus wasn't going around calling people fags, but hey, I guess if you are preaching the "word of God" then God will forgive you.

Now today we have people knocking on our door and running off. We have done nothing wrong. Sure the kids get a bot obnoxious, but what children don't? What can I do and is this considered harassment?

Anyway I returned back to Ireland and my wife and son joined me shortly after where we lived for a year and 3 months.

Can someone tell me if there is anyway to file some of the forms(I-765, I-130) individually before applying for permanent residence?  If not is it possible to get an extension on my visa waiver?

Can someone please advise the best relevant course of action and hopefully some tips on possibly only filing some of the forms?      Any help is greatly appreciated from the heart,      Thank you.

Democrats wouldn't actually change the light bulb, but they would show compassion for it by talking a lot about how terrible it is in the dark and more funding is needed to improve dim, 60 watt bulbs up to bright and productive 100 watt bulbs.       Republicans wouldn't actually change the light bulb, but they would tell the light bulb to stop complaining about being burned out and change itself, ignoring scientific facts about no longer being capable of producing light. Meanwhile, at home, the conservatives would have closets full of unused light bulbs.

20090227114819AAd2VCq	Politics & Government;Elections	It would seem this Obama proof requirement is growing - What do you think?	Major General Says President's Eligibility Needs Proof   'Most Important, What I Really Want is the Truth'      ______________________________________...   Posted: February 26, 2009   11:40 pm Eastern   By Bob Unruh   ? 2009 WorldNetDaily        Retired Maj. Gen. Carroll Childers   On the heels of two active duty members of the U.S. military serving in Iraq calling for President Obama to prove his eligibility to be president, a retired major general has agreed to join the case, saying he just wants "the truth."    WND reported earlier when 1st Lt. Scott Easterling confirmed to California attorney Orly Taitz that he wanted to be a plaintiff in the legal action she is preparing on behalf of members of the U.S. military, both active and retired. A second soldier who asked that his name be withheld for now became part of the action just a day later.    Now retired Maj. Gen. Carroll D. Childers has submitted a statement to Taitz and her DefendOurFreedoms.us website, agreeing to be a plaintiff in her pending action.    "I agree to be a plaintiff in the legal action to be filed by Orly Taitz, Esq. in a petition for a declaratory judgement (sic) that Barack Hussein Obama is not qualified to be president of the U.S., nor to be commander in chief of the U.S. armed forces, in that I am or was a sworn member of the U.S. military (subject to recall)," he wrote.    If recalled, he would be "unable to follow any orders given by a constitutionally unqualified commander in chief, since by doing so I would be subject to charges of aiding and abetting fraud and committing acts of treason," he wrote.    In an accompanying letter, Childers said, "What I really want is the truth; is Obama a natural born citizen of the United States. If not a natural born citizen, America has been defrauded and then we would be stuck with Joe Biden whose only redeeming attribute is that he is probably not a communist."    He said he is an engineer after serving for 38 years in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Operation Desert Storm and other locations.    Childers said there were a long list of reasons he didn't support Obama for president, including "his crime associates in the USA … his promise to make coal power industry bankrupt … his spread the wealth admission … his associations with foreign leaders unfriendly to the USA … (and his lack of) integrity."    But he said he believes Obama is not eligible to be president, a claim Obama spokesmen have described to WND as "garbage."    WND has reported on multiple legal challenges to Obama's status as a "natural born citizen." The Constitution, Article 2, Section 1, states, "No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President."    Some of the lawsuits question whether he was actually born in Hawaii, as he insists. If he was born out of the country, Obama's American mother, the suits contend, was too young at the time of his birth to confer American citizenship to her son under the law at the time.    Other challenges have focused on Obama's citizenship through his father, a Kenyan subject to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom at the time of his birth, thus making him a dual citizen. The cases contend the framers of the Constitution excluded dual citizens from qualifying as natural born.    Where's the proof Barack Obama was born in the U.S. or that he fulfills the "natural-born American" clause in the Constitution? If you still want to see it, join more than 290,000 others and sign up now!    Several of the cases have involved emergency appeals to the U.S. Supreme Court in which justices have declined to hear arguments. Among the cases turned down without a hearing at the high court have been petitions by Philip Berg, Cort Wrotnowski, Leo Donofrio and Taitz.    Military.com reported Easterling's concerns following WND's report and confirmed that Army officials said they were aware of the lieutenant's letter. The officials, Military.com said, are trying to balance the "military requirements under the Uniform Code of Military Justice versus critical freedoms that all Americans enjoy."    Commenters on the website called the soldier "a delusional racist," "moronic and irrelevent (sic)," and undeserving of his uniform.    However, some defended him.    "The questions about the POTUS and his birth were questions raised during the campaign – quite often in this website. This question was not always answered in a fashion which was clear cut yea or nay," said one forum contributor. "There are lawsuits ongoing – therefore there are other doubters."    Said another, "If anybody does their research they find out that a full investigation was conducted regarding McCain's eligibility (born on a military base on foreign soil), but no such investigation was done for BO. BO admits to traveling to Pakistan in 1981, when it was illegal to do so for US citizens at the time, how did he pull that off?    "Open your eyes, lemmmings (

20090227111627AA43yjq	Politics & Government;Elections	Mayan VISIONARIES had Obama's DISASTROUS EFFECTS in mind when they saw the END of the World in 2012?	he Mayans had a very precise understanding of our solar system's cycles and believed that these cycles coincided with our spiritual and collective consciousness. The most significant of which has much to do with the 2012 prophecies. In the following writing, we will walk through the main details of their prophecies surrounding the 2012 transition. How the transition takes place (from an astronomical perspective), what it means for us, and when the cycles take place. We'll start with the basic prophecies and later move deeper into the explanation of the cycles.      The Mayans prophesied that from 1999 we have 13 years to realize the changes in our conscious attitude to stray from the path of self-destruction and instead move onto a path that opens our consciousness to integrate us with all that exists.    http://www.adishakti.org/mayan_end_times...

As some of our readers have already noticed, there was a significant problem with the daily sea ice data images on February 16. The problem arose from a malfunction of the satellite sensor we use for our daily sea ice products. Upon further investigation, we discovered that starting around early January, an error known as sensor drift caused a slowly growing underestimation of Arctic sea ice extent. The underestimation reached approximately 500,000 square kilometers (193,000 square miles) by mid-February. Sensor drift, although infrequent, does occasionally occur and it is one of the things that we account for during quality control measures prior to archiving the data. See below for more details.       http://blogofbile.com/2009/02/19/consist...        http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/

I also have a friend who is getting charged because he confronted 2 men who were in the middle of breaking in to a house and when they attacked him he defended himself, he subdued one and the other ran off. the one he subdued complained to the police because his jaw was broken by my friend who was only defending himself while preventing a breakin but he is still getting charged.
20090308000410AApeuZG	Politics & Government;Politics	Why did Obama and Hillary both embarrass us so badly this week?	Unfortunately for us we couldn't count on the Obama Administration to simply destroy our economy and be happy with that, no they had a week of Foreign Relations errors as well!              After the embarrassment of President Obama returning a bust of Winston Churchill to the Brits, (something seen as an insult to the British people), President Obama met this week with Gordon Brown the British Prime Minister who upon their first meeting gave President Obama the following thoughtful gifts:      An ornamental desk pen holder made from the oak timbers of Victorian anti-slaver HMS Gannet, once named HMS President.      The framed commission for HMS Resolute, a vessel that came to symbolize Anglo-US peace when it was saved from ice packs by Americans and given to Queen Victoria.      and finally      A first edition set of the seven-volume classic biography of Churchill by Sir Martin Gilbert.            Now all of these wonderful gifts were obviously well thought out and given with great respect to President Obama.  However, it became obvious that that respect was a one way street when President Obama in return gave a DVD boxed set of classic American movies in spite of the fact that Prime Minister Gordon Brown is not a movie buff!  As if to add insult to injury, Michelle Obama also gave PM Gordon Brown plastic toy replicas of Marine One from the White House gift shop to give to his kids.  What an embarrassment!           Not to be outdone of course, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov a "Reset Button" that was supposed to be a backhanded slap at President Bush.        Not only was this a gift of poor taste and unnecessarily insulting to our former President, but she neglected to have the Russian word printed on the button verified.  Instead of "Reset", the button actually read "Overload" in Russian.  How ironic as I am already on "Overload" with the entire Obama Administration!          President Obama's only achievements so far seem to be tanking the Stock Market, devaluing our currency, mortgaging our children's future and embarrassing us in the eyes of the International community.  He has only been in office a little over a month...I don't even want to think about what things are going to look like in two years!        http://www.thehotjoints.com/2009/03/05/c...        http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090307/od_...

20090307225406AABrFFs	Politics & Government;Government	Stimulate this -First of all let me tell you  I'm not as smart as the CEO's that make millions and then almost?	bankrupt their company. I'm just one of the countless people who have been let go after many years of service. So I'm sure their are some flaws to my idea, but it could be at least a good start.       The government pays the salaries of people laid off in the last 6 months to a year, if they are hired back. So instead of paying people unemployment for doing nothing, the government would be paying people to work. It could be a combination of state and federal money. Since the state is already paying about half (in unemployment), the federal government would only have to "match" what the state is paying. If we do this, workers would have jobs and employers would have "free" labor. The government could pay this benefit for a year. After that, if the company retained the employees, they would receive a tax break of some kind. I'm sure some companies would try and cheat the government, but don't a lot of the unemployed do this anyway.   It seems like a win/win/win situation. Workers would have jobs. They'd have money(more than they would if just on unemployment). Be able to spend more money and pay more taxes. Companies would their post lay off payroll, but their pre lay off employee size, without paying any extra. They would be able to produce more products. And with more people having jobs, the companies would be able to increase sales. With more people working and companes increasing sales, the government would be getting more money in taxes. Win/win/win.

I am on unpaid family leave/disability until mid-May due to complications with pre-eclampsia after my baby was born in Nov.       I have a school loan that is now being handled by a law firm. I had tried over the last six months to contact, in writing,the credit collection agencies that were handling the loan but no one would respond to my inquiries. Now this law firm is handling the account and they are very difficult to deal with on the phone. I've made two attempts to talk with their staff but they just bark at me, make personal attacks and I end up getting nowhere even though my intent is to resolve this debt. They tell me they won't settle for less than 20% of the balance which is $2000 that I don't have, and that it would have to be paid off in one year. Considering the rest of my debt, this is simply undoable.      Anyway, I believe the case has now been filed in court and I am waiting nervously to see when I'll be subpoenaed. A friend of mine suggested not answering the door so that I will have more time because supposedly I'll have 30 days to respond AFTER the subpoena is handed to me. Now I'm not answering the door but it is difficult because we get so many solicitors in this neighborhood and there's always people coming to the door.      Anyone have any suggestions or experience with this kind of issue? PLEASE, don't send me negative, discouraging remarks about my predicament. I'm feeling very distressed as it is and need people who will be non-judgmental.      Thanks so much.

20090227115920AAT7N0k	Politics & Government;Elections	Any other blacks freaked out by all the people smiling at them?	We're excited Barack is president, too, and we're glad you're happy for us. But giving us the thumbs up for no reason, or saying hello whenever we walk by, is really starting to freak us out.      I just want to be able to stand in line at Home Depot without getting patted on the back.  I can't even be at a bar anymore if they have the news on.  Obama gives a speech on the economy and people act like my team just won the Super Bowl. I didn't even vote for the guy. I'm a Libertarian.      Everywhere I go, there they are: offering me pancakes, laughing at all my jokes, even bursting into tears when they see me.  I know you mean well and all, but seriously, knock it off. You're giving my children nightmares.

Going to make a long story short, five years ago I moved to southcarolina from Boston.  I bought a home and everything was escrowed ( taxes, insurance, payment ) I just found out that i have been paying over $1,700.00 a year for insurance. I have gotten five quotes from leading insurance companies and every quote is under $500.00 for the year.  This is with the exact same coverage.  Is that legal?  Should i look into this a little closer?  Thanks for your help.  Jason

20090307095553AAlupVB	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is Obama following Hugo Chavez's advice?? Is Venezuela a good model for the USA?	Chavez Tells Obama He Should Follow Venezuela’s Socialist Path       March 6 (Bloomberg) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez comments on U.S. President Barack Obama and the state of the U.S. economy. He made the remarks today on Venezuelan state television.       “It’s regrettable the crisis that the U.S. is living through. Millions of workers are being left in the street, thousands of companies are closing, in the U.S. there isn’t a single new infrastructure project. Go look for a highway there, the country has gone bust.”       “Now President Obama arrived with some announcements, hopefully, but the capitalist model and its perverse values have failed.”       “I recommend to Obama -- they’re criticizing him because they say he’s moving towards socialism -- come Obama, ally with us on the path to socialism, it’s the only road.”       “Imagine a socialist revolution in the U.S. Nothing is impossible.”        http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=2...

20081008003111AANWYCd	Politics & Government;Elections	Does anyone know what Barack's name means?	In Hebrew,  Barack means lightning.      a brilliant electric spark discharge in the atmosphere, occurring within a thundercloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground.         And what does John's name mean in English?      a restroom, public washroom, a place where people go do urinate and defecate.      and my favorite of all, a guy who has sex with hookers!         Somehow, I'd rather have a president whose name means lightning rather than a public restroom.  LOL         Just thought you all might like to know.

20090307160133AAdRufI	Politics & Government;Politics	Will Republicans bow down and accept the NWO when they realize that the U.S. is one big Ponzi scheme?	I was trying to get a point across in my last question, however, cons here reported it and had it removed.      As I said before, how can Republicans turn their backs to the fact that the so called money they earn is at the expense of others.  Facts:  The U.S. is over $11 trillion in debt and growing without any solid plans to pay it all back, let alone paying any of it.  The national debt has been increasing substantially for decades now.  To add fuel to the fire, we import $10 billion more a month than we export.  So, my point was before that no other country even comes close to the amount of debt that the U.S. has.  Why do you hold other countries that have little or no debt to a higher standard?  Why not let some poor country like Zimbabwe run up a trillion dollar debt, because they have just as much as a chance as we do of paying it back?  So Republicans were all crying, so what, look at the GDP.  What about the GDP?  It's all a Ponzi scam.  OK, say company A buys a product from China for a $1 and then sells it to company B for $4 and then company C buys it for $10, etc., etc., etc......this is all part of the GDP, it's part of a Ponzi scheme.  Go figure, your country is over $11 trillion and growing in debt and you have NO, ZERO solutions to getting out of debt.      Please, BOW DOWN TO BHO the leader of the NWO!!!!
