XnNhaxwPaa	VC games are emulated ROM files of old NES, SNES, N64, Genesis, TG-16, SMS and C64 games.<br>  <br>  WiiWare are games made specifically for the Wii.|`|QSlUrTPOaa	WiiWare is nintendo wii games that have never been released on other consoles. These games you cannot purchase on discs, because most of them would only cost about $10-$15.<br>  <br>  Virtual Console games are exact copies of past games released on Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Nintendo 64 (N64). Not every game released is avaliable, only the really popular and successful ones were released. To play these games you need a classic controller which can be bought at any store that sells wii games.<br>  <br>  Both WiiWare and Virtual Console can only be bought off the Wii Shop Channel. You can only do this if your wii has internet.|`|oZqoxgc7aa	Virtual console games are ports from other systems, wiiware is all original content. Wiiware is essentially an outlet for indie game manufacturers and programmers to submit a game for release to nintendo without going through the building media and distributing hassle
DUMYQ3Sgaa	no u can't use a at&t phone wit sprint because sprint dose not use sim card hope i helped you :)
WJsrzHD4aa	Ok you just locked your phone on accident and if you did not have a password the default password is 1234 so just put that in as pin password and your phone should be unlocked.|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	when asking for new sim pin, your not to use your PUK code, pick a new 4 digit code for your pin. You would have to enter it twice.
qR4xcTfaaa	There is not much of a difference between these cameras.<br>  However, you should seriously look in to buying a new D80, it is much more solid than both D60 & D40, it is a PRO level camera and the price just dropped by 33%.<br>  With the D80 you can use *ALL* NIKON NIKKOR Auto Focus lenses, but with the D40x & D60 you can only use DX lenses. This will prevent you from upgrading in the future to a FX full frame cameras.<br>  <br>  Therefor you should definitely go with the D80 it is very user friendly you will be very happy with it as I am, I guaranty it. <br>  You can buy it on Ebay new with many accessories for less than $500.<br>  <br>  I recommend for you to start with a mid level lens, the lenses that come with the camera are low end;<br>  You must always remember - The LENS is the most important part of the picture, therefor you should invest in mid to high end lenses.<br>  Starting with 24-85mm F2.8/4.0 is a very good serious amateur lens for wide angle(or 24-120mm) this lens is great for Landscape, portrait and micro pictures. Also the 16-85mm. As for Tele Zoom I recommend the 80-200mm F2.8 ED even if you get it used from a good owner (new is almost $1000 or you can get the TOKINA model or TEMRON etc) this lens is great for wild life photography. with these 2 lenses you can not go wrong, the first lens also have a 1:2 Micro capability and since the D40 is a DX camera it will be 1:1.5, this will allow you to get very Very close to a flower or butterfly etc.<br>  The range will be 35-117mm and 117-290mm since they are FX lenses (which also gives you the opportunity in the future to upgrade to an FX camera and then 24mm will be 24mm etc) the GLASS in these lenses are the best of NIKON NIKKOR.|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I would recommend Nikon D60 over D40.It is an excellent DSLR, very easy to use and provides excellent images without requiring a lot of technical knowledge.

4ef759a72bd240232f7647985dcd2818aa	Airtel, like any other operator has full right to discontinue your all other numbers for default in any number.<br>  <br>  When it seems evident that u have not paid up the amount due on a particular number and are using another number, the service provider sensing a possible default on this number also can stop services. Its common practise to stop services, if u are not paying up.<br>  <br>  If u still resist to pay up, u would be receiving payment reminder calls, and later a legal notice. I hope u are aware of the process, that happened in cases of bank credit card / loan defaults.<br>  <br>  Your seeking legal assistance will not be of any help if u delayed the problem solving process. If u intentionally stopped the payment, the same will go against u. If any billing dispute is there, get it resolved as fast as possible, before its gets out of hand.<br>  <br>  Moreover, you can't escape claiming that the defaulted number is not yours any longer. The service provider will definately take the following steps seriously:<br>  01. No "Name Transfer" documents were submitted to it for transfer of name to some other person. Until then, its your liability for everything, including any misuse, since u didn't inform the customer care, either in verbal or written form.<br>  02. They will certainly compare the dialled number list in both the numbers. Don't forget, that they can go to the beginning.<br>  03. Address Verification Confirmation Details: The formalities u completed in the beginning.<br>  <br>  I can't write it any simpler.|`|bXPU7eGwaa	Im also using airtel number and i used more then 5-6 different airtel numbers on same address and name and my most numbers got disconnected due to non-payment of bills but non of them affected any current number.<br>  <br>  If airtel has blocked ur number then try to convinced them saying that that wasn't ur connection somebody has taken in your name if they convinced, agree and unblock ur number then its okey or else simply throw that SIM in trash. If u r student then its not that tough. Get a new connection with some new address or on different name.<br>  <br>  U cannot do anything on this coz u cannot stand against any big company and u ll lose more money and time. Which seems worthless for u.|`|koT9on0waa	They can block your another sim.you should not go to court.because airtel is big company and most important is that you was having 2 numbers from same company.so if they are loosing money on one number belongs to same person so will do that.so take sim from another company or clear your balance.
71wBNgbnaa	I'm sure there's probably a very plausible explanation for why she didn't call you. Something may have come up, or she may have not even been able to come into work today. <br>  <br>  Your idea for calling her tomorrow is very reasonable - just call and ask if maybe you could go ahead and do the interview, or if you could reschedule it. Since she's in the wrong here, I don't see why she wouldn't be willing to reschedule the interview. <br>  <br>  I hope this helped, and good luck with the interview! :)|`|xrp88kKAaa	I kind of had the same thing happen to me.<br>  <br>  I applied for a job at a laser tag place, got a date and time for an interview.

V2LN27sSaa	yea well make sure you don't keep the backlight on all the time because that makes it go down super fast, keep it out of extremely hot or extremely cold temperatures, and the video makes it die faster too. btw, make sure your turning it off right. i cant tell you how to turn it off right because i don't what kind of nano you got. :)
ZdF9tnzkaa	Actually, the g1 phone shouldn't even function without the tmobile internet plan, since when you turn it on, you have to sign up for gmail and all that jazz.|`|BhNP2P8Xaa	Probably not.<br>  <br>  The G1 is an internet capable phone. You won't be able to do anything but make calls with a pre-paid plan. You'll have no data. <br>  <br>  Seems like a lot to spend on a phone for a pay-as-you-go plan.
ejGB0Thfaa	the iPod chromatic is really cool! I definitely recommend getting the chromatic!<br>  <br>  It's the closest thing to an iPod touch cause you can shake it to shuffle the songs, and you can turn it side ways to watch tv episodes and movies.|`|vgO8E0NCaa	How much memory do you need?<br>  <br>  iPod Nano 3G  =  4gb and 8gb<br>  iPod Nano 4G / Chromatic  =  8gb and 16gb.<br>  <br>  Unless you need 16gb there is really no reason to get a iPod Nano 4G.<br>  You can get an iPod Nano 3G really cheap now on the web. They don't sell it in stores no more.|`|tzySIuZvaa	Those are the same thing!|`|EJarspFAaa	4th gen=chromatic, I think. The 3rd gen is the short/fat one.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would go with a SanDisk Sansa Fuze. Better sound quality, more features (radio, customizable equalizer and wallpaper, more audio formats, voice recorder, etc.), and supports SD cards (meaning if you run out of space, you can buy a card to add space..it's like ten bucks for a 4 GB card, and there are many sizes).<br>  <br>  It's about 80 bucks for the 4 GB and 100 for the 8 GB (was $130). Check out this review: <br>  <a href="http://www.anythingbutipod.com/archives/2008/03/sandisk-sansa-fuze-review.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.anythingbutipod.com/archives/...</a><br>  <br>  I really like mine, and would take it over a chromatic any day of the week. The chromatic has useless features like shake the screen to change songs and portrait view. Not to mention there will just be a new one that you will just have to get in a few months.|`|6P27whuGaa	I don't know if this is good or bad, but the 4th generation nano is the chromatic.|`|vD0Nkjvfaa	ipod chromatic! i have one and its SOO awesome!

379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	I would recommend renting a piano if you are interested in learning. If you want to get a Keyboard first to learn on, you could buy a used one. That way, if things don't work out you haven't invested too much.

j5Apt8hWaa	Well as you said, you want to learn to be a pro and now is a good time.  What you can do, is buy a used Nikon or Canon 35 mm SLR with standard zoom for under $150 on craigslist.  You can then start learning how to use a fully adjustable camera, using the cameras light meter to guide you when choosing the aperture or shutter speed.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......<br>  <br>  The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|WJsrzHD4aa	If you want to be a proffesional photographer and you are just starting off you should look at a FUJIFILM.

What happens is that people sell their film cameras and then realize they have film they need to get rid of too, so they put it up on eBay, sometimes in real small lots of 2 or 3 rolls.<br>  <br>  Only buy film that has been refrigerated.  Even recently expired film is okay, if it has been refrigerated.<br>  <br>  A 5-pack of film on Amazon is about $18 to $26 typically, depending on film type or about $5/roll.  With a bit of careful shopping on eBay, U can find people selling 1 to 3 rolls for much less than that, but you will pay for shipping. A search on eBay for: 120 expired turned up 120 film bargains at around $2/roll.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, U can go to a local pro camera shop, but the cost per roll will be about double.  In that case, U are better off buying 5 rolls on Amazon and just keeping the unused film in the refrigerator for later use.|`|8AYA5gTBaa	The Diana+ camera prefers films with ISO400. The ISO rating refers to the speed of the film.<br>  <br>  So what you want to get is 120 film, with a rating of ISO 400.<br>  <br>  There are several films that fit this bill, in Black and White, and Color.<br>  <br>  I recommend going with a major manufacturer, like Kodak, Ilford or Fuji, because they all use light colored backing paper with black numbers. This is good because it makes reading the frame number through the red counter window much easier.<br>  <br>  BW films:<br>  Kodak - Tri-X, Tri-X Pro 320, T-MAX 400<br>  Ilford - Delta Pro 400, HP-5<br>  <br>  Color Films:<br>  Kodak - Portra 400VC, Portra 400NC<br>  Fuji - Fujicolor Pro400H. <br>  <br>  Freestyle Photo Supply or BH Photo Video are good places to look.<br>  <a href="http://freestylephoto.biz/" rel="nofollow">http://freestylephoto.biz/</a><br>  <a href="http://bhphotovideo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bhphotovideo.com/</a><br>  <br>  If your boyfriend needs help loading his new camera, point him to my youtube channel, where I have several how-to videos for the Diana camera:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/kaituba" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/kaituba</a><br>  <br>  I also have several pointers and tips up on my website:<br>  <a href="http://dianacamera.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dianacamera.com/</a>

HxsvpxDqaa	There is a Sport Continuous Mode in your camera that enables you to shoot pictures 45 consecutive photos at almost 15fps. For the type of picture in the above frame, you need to set up your camera on a tripod, making sure the complete frame is covered in the viewfinder.<br>  <br>  Then, tell your subject to do whatever you need him to be doing while you take the shot. When you're done, you will end up with a series of shots with consecutive frames in them.<br>  <br>  Then, you need to combine those shots into one frame, and frankly, i dont see how you can effectively do  that with Windows Movie Maker. What you need for this sort of this thing is a proper Image Editing software. You will have to overlay the pictures on top of one another. <br>  <br>  This should be easy, since the environment in each frame should be similar. You will have to ensure this when taking the shots. Make sure that people dont walk into the frame mid-shot, or the trees dont move too much, or there are no moving things, such as cars or bikes, in the background. <br>  <br>  You can overlay pictures using Adobe Photoshop, which is a rather expensive option. You can use GIMP, which is a free open-source image editing platform. You can find it at this link.<br>  <br>  GIMP (<a href="http://www.gimp.org/downloads/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/downloads/)</a>

tlmd4GdYaa	The ipod touch second generation has three benefits and three disadvantages.  The benefits include a built in speaker, volume control buttons (very useful), and all around software improvements that make everything a little better.  The disadvantages are a higher price, and it probably won't work with your old chargers because Apple took away firewire compatibility, the type of connection most ipods used in the past.  This means while your dock plays your ipods music, it might not charge it.  If you own existing hardware like docks or chargers, do some research and find out if the ipod touch second generation is compatible.  The third disadvantage is only temporary.  You are not currently able to jailbreak ipod touch second generation.  For the general public, this is not a concern, as you will probably never consider jailbreaking your device.  All in all, the second generation is a higher quality, just make sure your pre-existing hardware functions with it.|`|n8NBVCvnaa	the 2nd gen is More advanced, with the external speakers etc...<br>  but the second gen cannot be jail broken at this Time either.<br>  <br>  if you don't mind about that, go for the 2nd gen|`|VWu4yMRaaa	get the 2nd gen!

The only time I think you will find a book cheaper will be from the used books at Amazon Marketplace.<br>  Also,  The instant gratification of Whispernet feature (The downloadable service that uses the Sprint EVDO network, at no fee) is awesome.  I can browse, purchase and download new books, magazines or newspapers right from my K2. <br>  Yes, the K2 (or any other E-reader) is a little steep in price.  But I am very happy with mine.<br>  Sony offers an e-reader but does not come close to the volume of available books.  Those that have both have said that Sony's books are more expensive.  But you need to check that out.<br>  Hope that answered your questions. Feel free to contact me if you have any more.|`|R20LOzsiaa	Yes, Kindle books are cheaper than the actual books. There are some figures coming out saying that if you purchased 70 Kindle books, the Kindle device's price is already covered from the saving compare to buying actual books.<br>  <br>  Check the price yourself here, price are different and there are many books under $9.99:<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FBooks-Kindle%2Fb%3Fie%3DUTF8%26node%3D154606011%26ref%255F%3Dsv%255Fkinc%255F1&tag=moreinfo-po-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?i...</a><br>  <br>  I made up my decision to buy Kindle 2 after reading a review on it.

KLL0Acrwaa	These are conversion lenses and what're you're seeing is called vignetting.<br>  <br>  About the only way to get rid of the vignetting is to zoom slightly with your SD-100 to get rid of the dark frame edges.<br>  <br>  You're most likely to see this with the wide-angle conversion lens.<br>  <br>  Your camera really wasn't designed like an SLR to add lenses, so this is pretty much normal.
b207128f6213ea5411a368f91e6bb3d1aa	Our three pin plugs are required to be insulated against a current of 13 amps regardless of the actual current drawn and the rating of the cable wired into them. All three pin plugs have a fuse to protect against short circuits. A short circuit occurs when a current is allowed to reach ground potential without reference to the full circuit. This means that it is operating without reference to the full resistance of the circuit. As you may know, V=IR (where v= voltage or electro-motive force, I= current and R= Resistance) and so transposing the formula I=V/R<br>  It follows then that at an RMS of 240 volts, if you have a resistance of 10, 000 ohms,  the drawn current to the circuit will be 240/10000 or 0.024 Amperes.<br>  If the circuit shorts, so that only 100 ohms of resistance is encountered, the current will become 240/100 or 2.4 A, but in the case <br>  of 10 ohms you'll get 24 A. <br>  If you take the top off a three pin plug and look down, so that the pins are facing the ground, you'll see that the fuse is on the right hand side and fits between the pin and the bit where you terminate the cable. Electricians call this live. Many modern plugs are sealed and you take the fuse out by a pull-out carrier, but it's still the same inside.<br>  Plug fuses are rated for the device they serve. If the device is expected to draw less than 3 amps, a three amp fuse is used. If more than 3 but less than 5, a 5 amp fuse. You used to be able to get 7,9 and 13 but 7 and 9 have gone by the wayside now. Anything doing more than 13 amps won't have a plug, it'll be hard-wired into an outlet, like a cooker.<br>  The idea of a fuse is that it can only carry so much power before it melts. Power is equal to current times the voltage, so at 240V and 3 amps you get 720 Watts, which is very nearly one Horsepower. The more power you put through, the more heat you get, and that's what causes the fuse to melt.<br>  Looking again at the three-pin, if you look on the left you'll see that there is a pin into which the wire fits directly. Electricians call this neutral. If you touch it whilst current is flowing though you'll still get a shock.<br>  Lastly on a three-pin there is the middle plug, set upwards from the others so that it forms the apex of a triangle. This is the Earth connection. Should you get a current on metal casing, this will cause it to go to ground. Your mains is connected to the ground via bits of metal, and this prevents you from getting a shock.The other end of the Earth wire is connected to the casing.<br>  Earthing is not as common as it used to be thanks to double insulating. If you look at a plastic transformer, you'll find a little square box inside a slightly bigger square box printed on it: this means double<br>  insulating.<br>  The two-pins carry only 110 volts, and the power is therefore halved. Usually a device fitted with a two pin has an internal fusing arrangement.<br>  Wire-breakers are no longer fitted as the accuracy was doubtful although there are plenty still out there. The modern installation uses an RCD (Residual Current Device) which does indeed have circuit breakers and works by means of a toroidal transformer.<br>  You can learn more about the RCD here:<br>  <a href="http://www.the50plus.co.uk/tech_support/RCDsIEE2005.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.the50plus.co.uk/tech_support/...</a>|`|CB15kchkaa	Wire breakers are a thing of the past! As another answerer pointed out, most europen 'two' pin plugs actually have a third contact on the sides. In the case of those items which do not have an earth connection, it's because it will be fitted to an item which is double insulated, ie. it has no metal casing.|`|jtoxFsdYaa	Two pin mains plugs have not been in general use in the UK for over 30 years, basically since the introduction of the 13 amp ring main system of electrical wiring. The principal drawback with two pin plugs is that they do not have an earth connection where as the third pin, which is usually longer than the other two so that it connects first and disconnects last, is the earth contact.  <br>  <br>  I am not sure what you mean by "wire breakers" though. If you mean the old fashioned wired fuses made of porcelain, there are very few of those left these days having been replaced by circuit breakers in most general cases or by cartridge fuses in some larger current applications.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, the negative line also goes to earth at the local substation because all power stations are connected to earth and only the positive line is carried on pylons and in other electrical distribution networks.|`|26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	You are sure about those French 2 pin plugs?<br>  <br>  I think if you look more closely, you will see that although there are only two pins, there is also a contact on the side of the connector, that is used to make the earth connection, so it is not any different to the UK massive 13 amp square pin plug, electrically speaking.<br>  <br>  The function of the earth contact is to ensure that the metal shroud of any equipment connected to the mains is kept at earth potential. More often today, the portable equipment is double insulated, so there is no need for an earth connection, and earth leakage breakers isolate the mains supply when a small level of earth current flows, preventing injury. <br>  <br>  The old wired fuses are no longer permitted in new installations in the UK as they are far too tolerant of overcurrent, and do not provide an adequate safety factor. Breakers are used in all current installations.|`|AA11808995	The 3rd wire at the top usually green is the earth wire and any malfunction will send the power to earth.We also now have circuit breakers.In other countries they may have 2 pin one live one neutral on light load circuits which will trip a circuit breaker in the event of a malfunction.On circuits that need an heavy load a earth wire will be fitted.|`|a2OeOFeMaa	sorry. No idea. I also questioned 'two pin plugs' in Canada. Never felt they were safe! Don't understand either system

After that you would go to your email account on the phone and then open up the email and download the attachment.

qGfAlDd2aa	Bad things, hmmmm.<br>  <br>  1. The way it's been handled, there is a LOT of confusion among consumers.  Everything from "over the air TV is going away" to "I have to buy a lot of new expensive equipment" to "Will my cable turn HD".<br>  2.  The government converter coupon program was bungled.  It was poorly planned and underfunded from the start.  It's also spending taxpayer money so it's another government bail out.<br>  3. Digital is a new technology and the general public is still learning how it works.  So, many people don't understand that if you don't have a good signal, it just won't work.<br>  4.  Congress changed the transition date at the last minute after three years of advertising February 17, 2009.  That confused the public more than they already were.<br>  5.  Extending the transition date causes broadcasters to burn more electricity to keep the redundant analog transmitter on the air.  Typical costs would be around $20,000 a month.  This wastes energy and puts broadcasters in the position of either laying off people or paying the electric bill.  This is a pretty bone headed decision by a Congress that claims it's trying to save jobs and decrease our energy usage.|`|N2p30Mo4aa	Not sure, maybe the cost of cables and tvs to get actual HDTV...but I like the answer above me, got my vote

fKNyVtHJaa	Grip the bar in two places, about 2 inches in from each end. Pull gradually but firmly away from the TV whilst gently trying to twist the bar in little circles. It should come off fairly easily if it's only been on a while but will be stuck harder if it's been on the TV for 6 months or more. Remember to try and twist the bar as a whole and don't just pull up on one end or you risk snapping it. HTH.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	hell yea! do you hink that the senso bar is a cheap toothpick??? i had to do that twice after my nephew broke my flat screen. grip it with two hands, and slowly pull it twisting each end gradually as you pull. i is not rocket science, just use your common sense. and if you are mounting it to the bottom of a hanging tv, then DO NOT USE TAPE! go to gamestop or walmart, or wherever sells nintendo wii consoles, and ask them for a sensor bar stickey... i asked them for one, and they gave me 10 for a dollar.|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Of course you can|`|9UbOlxt6aa	Take it off like you take a band-aid off but be sure to spread your fingers out evenly at different points of pressure across the top of the sensor bar first and then work the bottom. After you've broken the main adhesion, grab each side a few inches in from sides and slowly twist in small circles until the rest of the adhesion has broken grip. Good luck!|`|Ap621Druaa	yes you can just pick it up and your done or if its not wirless you need to pick it up but more carefully

This can work on any song, although if the difficulty is on easy it may not happen since there aren't that many notes to play to begin with.

If that one doesn't work, you may have bent the pins on the reader when you tried putting the Memory Stick into it. You can't swap VC games with friends anyways or else no one would bother buying them and they'd just download them all off the net.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	ok, first of all, you cant put virtual console games onto a SD card and then transfer it to another wii. you can only put Wii game disc data onto an SD card. you probably need to upgrade your firmware, it has to be over 2.0 to read the SD card. the memory stick could only have damaged it if you put the stick in, and PULLED it forcefully out while wiggling the stick. or just buy a new SD card . it has to be a 2GB or under for the wii to read it.|`|XT8rCpRbaa	if you had it since launch... did you update it? the firmware that came with launch Wiis didn't support SD cards yet.
8cWXue35aa	Time traveling is not a good idea unless you do it a little at a time. When you time travel, weeds grow and your neighbors don't like living in your town anymore so they move out and new neighbors move in.  By traveling back to 2008 the game probably read that as if you hadn't played in a year. You can either work really hard to repair the damage or bulldoze the town. Bulldozing the town gets rid of your current town and you must start over completely. The town will be layed out differently with different neighbors and your house will be small again (and of course you will have to work for Tom Nook and pay off your mortgages again.)|`|5HfuI3MEaa	yes.|`|GaIn9vp6aa	You have to START FROM SCRATCH.<br>  <br>  Your nooks will be Nooks Cranny.<br>  Your house will be SMALL.<br>  DON'T DO IT.<br>  <br>  I used to time travel a lot.<br>  Just pluck weeds when you see them.

q6uyloYdaa	I think the PS3 is better. It has better games and has the Blu-ray capabilities. It is more expensive however.<br>  The Wii is fun, but only for a little while. Most of the games are trash and/or are designed for little kids. Sure, the Mario games are good as they always are, but they are only fun for so long. There are very few games aimed towards adults. The picture quality is not nearly as good as the PS3. Also, you will find yourself shelling out more money for accessories and the controllers (cleverly sold in 2 parts) than you would for a PS3. The Wii will fizzle out; the PS3 will be around for years.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	wii if you want family friendly games.<br>  ps3 if you want adult graphiced games.|`|fLF2VM8uaa	I have both and I can assure you they are completely different. <br>  <br>  The Wii games are fun and very active, but the best Wii games are MUCH better in a group of people competing against one another. <br>  <br>  The PS3 games are fun too, but they tend to be more typical video games. They tend to be games that are played by one person. The PS3 has some games that are good to play in a group (Rock Band, Buzz, Singstar, LBP, a few shooters etc.), but the best games are more solo traditional type games. <br>  <br>  The PS3 has WAAAAAY more features. When choosing between the two I'd go with the PS3. You will get alot more use out of it.|`|IWcG1jgSaa	Really it comes down to what games you want to play more. You can't really have Mario and stuff for PS3 because it's Nintendo's. So before you choose, make sure you look into that.<br>  Another thing to really consider would be how the Wii has the unique, point the remote at the screen thingy (4got what it's called lol). It's really not the same to go back to regular games after you buy a Wii. One thing about the Wii though is it doesn't have very good graphics. They're okay though. It doesn't really bother me. I love my Wii to death and would die without it. haha<br>  The PS3 has superior HD graphics and the gaming experience is awesome. Everything feels so real. It may be a whole hell of a lot more expensive, but you have to remember it comes with a built in Blu-Ray player. <br>  so in the end, it's all about your choice of games. Right now, all i have is a Wii, but my mom is planning on getting a PS3 soon. They are both excellent in the end, but my favorite has always been Nintendo. So it's up to you.|`|hwaTOBL7aa	A billion people asked this already why don't you just search on yahoo answers! Whats the point of even asking this?! It's obvious some people are going to say Ps3 and others are going to pick the Wii. I bet you everything I own, that console wars will never end because of people like you!|`|77mwgDnZaa	definitely a ps3<br>  <br>  games are waaaaayy better.  and you can have the nifty blue ray feature and webite browsing together|`|kPUWgFQmaa	wii<br>  <br>  they are healthier because there are games for the wii that make you active
VOSyb1fcaa	There are three ways to get Wi-Fi on your Wii. You can do it through a router (recommended), you can get a Wi-Fi USB<br>  (it's been discontinued, but can still be found) and put it in your computer's router, or you can use a LAN adapter. <br>  <br>  Look here for more information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/onlineRequirements.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  Next, follow this link to a set-up guide, or read my instructions below:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems/wii/en_na/connectingOnline.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/systems...</a><br>  <br>  1.

Choose the from the connections your Wii has found (Look for your connection. You might have to provide some sort of password)<br>  <br>  If all goes well, you'll have to click OK a couple more times, wait for it to test the connection, then the Wii will reset itself and then you'll have internet!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5HfuI3MEaa	look in the white manual, it tells you everything!!! you people need to read the manual, cause no one wants to waste their time typing a 3 page thing when you already have it in your house.

q6uyloYdaa	I don't think it will come out in 2010. The PS3 is still trying to pick up steam, and Sony is really just getting started with the console. The PS2 is still around (although I think they are phasing it out this year) and it lasted 10 years. I'm sure they're in the beginning stages of creating a new console, but I wouldn't expect it for at least a couple of years.|`|eK2xCiFbaa	I can't see them bringing another console out for the foreseeable future.  The PS3 has more power than any other console which has yet to be harnessed.  Killzone 2 has made a jump in showing what it can do but the PS3 has more to come.  Additionally, PS1 made use of CD, PS2 - DVD, and now with PS3 - Blu Ray Disk.  Sony won't be bringing out another console till they develop another storage medium since higher definition games than we have at the moment will inevitably require much more storage space and a faster engine to run them on.  But that is years and years down the line.  2017 may seem likely depending on how fast the technology continues to advance but I wouldn't write off the PS3 for a new Sony console in the meantime.|`|N2rntAqvaa	Sony likes to make their consoles last quite a long time.<br>  <br>  The PS2 will last 10 years (at least).<br>  <br>  The PS1 lasted over 11 years.<br>  <br>  Sony never said that the PS4 will be launched on 2010.<br>  <br>  They would NEVER say that, especially not now.  This is why: Sony lost tons of money because of the PS3 because it was very expensive, and many people could not afford it.  After losing so much money from this, they would NEVER say the release date of the PS4.  People would wait until it's released instead of buying the PS3.  Besides, Sony is not even thinking about the PS4 yet.  <br>  <br>  They got a lot of work to do on the PS3.  Sony said the PS3 will last 10 years.  So if you want to hear some good confirmed news about the PS4 (which Sony is not even thinking about yet), you need to wait between 5-7 years until Sony will confirm any of those rumors about them.<br>  <br>  No one even knows if there will be a PS4.  Who knows?  Maybe they will make a brand new one-of-a-kind console, that is completely different from the Playstations?  <br>  <br>  The PS3 launched about 3 years ago.  Sony wants to make it last 10 years.  7 years to go.  Wait some time.  When a console releases, you shouldn't get too excited about the next one.  <br>  <br>  Lol, if Sony said it will be on 2010, they would lose so much money.  They are still working on improving the PS3, so why would they suddenly start working on a new one?|`|FyQYdILeaa	2013 in japan.<br>  2014 everywhere|`|a13b768dd41d6e9fbc8d5d241eee768aaa	They haven't even come close to maxing out the PS3 yet.

If yes, then you've gotten past the hard part.<br>  <br>  Next, go here <a href="http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/basic/games/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ticalc.org/pub/83plus/basic/g...</a> and download some games.<br>  <br>  Extract the .zip file with WinZip/WinRar/7zip/Other so you get the .8xp or .83p file.<br>  <br>  In TI-DeviceExplorer, go to Tools > Windows Explorer. Find the extracted file, then you should be able to simply drag-and-drop it from Windows Explorer to the DeviceExplorer window. That should begin the transfer.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

DNyQYKLHaa	I know a way not using bluetooth.<br>  <br>  But you don't actually have to put the music on the PS3 and have all the access to all your music, photos and videos on your laptop. First you put all the music you want in your windows media player library.  Then go to Network and Sharing on you laptop, and look for the bit that says Media Sharing and turn this on. You may need to go into your firewall setting etc to allow access.  Then when your PS3 is on click search for media devices under music, and on your laptop click on to the media sharing settings and allow the PS3, it might show up as something random depending on what it's named etc. But it should only come up with stuff connected to your router anyway. Then you can edit the preferences and hey presto. You now have full acess from you PS3 to anything on your library on your laptop. Provided your laptop is turned on of course. Let me know if you need more details, i'll send you my email in private.

5HfuI3MEaa	it does not work with the wii. and the sound cant go through the monitor... and no to the usb thing.
U3bD318gaa	Xthemanwith6legsX
mEzJ11cbaa	Are you thinking of Space Invaders?
DpAkYZaqaa	Try unplugging your xbox and plugging it back it. If that doesn't work you might need a new controller.
4tzHzqGfaa	no you can't use the wireless usb adapter but you  don't have to buy the xbox one either. Just connect it using a Ethernet cord.
AA10929465	The technical specs say it can only focus .43 feet (about five inches) away.  Try taking a picture from six inches away.  If that isn't good enough for you, your camera isn't capable of doing what you want. <br>  <br>  For comparison, my Fujifilm Finepix F10 will take pictures just a couple of inches away.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Use the macro for close up, but make sure you aren't in auto mode.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	if you are using the macro setting<br>  don't use the zoom<br>  only get as close as the camera allows<br>  (when it starts to blur - back off one half inch)<br>  <br>  have enough light in the room<br>  so you don't use the flash
3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If you have a mini dv (cassette) camcorder….<br>  Your dv camcorder needs a firewire connection (ieee 1394) in order to download video, your PC probably did not come with a firewire port, so you will have to buy one and install it, since most computers (except possibly brand new) don't come with a firewire port, your camcorder did not come with a firewire cord so you have to purchase a cord too. Your camcorder did come with a USB cord and that is used for downloading stills from your camcorder. Make sure your camera is in playback mode.<br>  The fine print in your manual makes reference to firewire (ieee 1394) connection.
QIlhmWwBaa	there is no black and white buttons<br>  if you have a white controller then the rb lb rt lt buttons would be white<br>  if you have the black controller then it would be black but i do not believe there is a mix of them|`|VBGOIGZhaa	What?? They are both white...
jUOtWcwraa	if your downloading off your computer with bit defender like any download software it will slow down your xbox 360 connection at my cousins house if your downloading like that you wouldn't have any xbox connection cause the downloader so this maybe your problem|`|SBcxooLsaa	whats a bit defender and call microsoft
RPRJ9yabaa	the eye in the ps2 has broke.. happened to me,i had to send it into sony... if you want call them<br>  <br>  <br>  1-800-345-7669<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!!|`|cYtXNUEMaa	i don't know but i have always hit the machine once or twice really hard if it doesn't work. Sometimes that helps. Might want to hit it more often.
0e1e3b65b3c1de6ffdd4ebc197d8f144aa	go to settings, then select display settings, then select video output settings, then HDMI, then custom, then u will see the options, 576p, 720p, 1080i and 1080p. tick off everything except 720p and if ur tv is a full hdtv then also tick 1080p then press right button and save the settings. If ur tv is not a high definition tv then u will see nothing so if the screen goes blank press circle or wait for 30secs and the screen will change back.<br>  <br>  No u need a HDMI cable to view resolutions of 720p or higher.|`|fLF2VM8uaa	First, connect whichever form of HD wire you are planning on using (Component or HDMI) to the TV and the PS3. Go into the settings icon on the XMB. Then go to display options change the display option from RCA to whichever HD source wire you are using (component or HDMI). <br>  <br>  It will change immediately and ask if you want to keep those settings. You will notice the difference immediately. <br>  <br>  PS If you are using HDMI you may want to switch the audio options to HDMI too.
5HfuI3MEaa	it is not possible, it has to be a router or a modem for a internet. the USB does not emit any wave that can be found by the wii. besides, read the white manual, it says only a router or a modem.
5HfuI3MEaa	you have to synchronize the remote, but first put batteries in it. to synchronize it, take the back cover of it off, and then open the SD door, and then press both red buttons for 15 seconds.|`|1Xgj6KuOaa	Most likely, Vicky Oil is right. But if it still doesn't work, the batteries on one of the remotes might be dead, or, if you mean you can only get one or two instruments to work, there might be something wrong with the instruments themselves.|`|kPUWgFQmaa	You need to sync the third remote<br>  <br>  You can do that by taking off the back cover of the remote, opening that little hatch in front of the wii and pressing the red buttons on both.|`|01Hlnz6haa	well it depends you cant have more than one drums if thats what you mean so guitar would be the only one that can have 2
DpAkYZaqaa	Yes they do, but usually in a year from when you bought it.
YYbaY6KRaa	You don't have a memory card or it isn't inserted properly so the photos are store on your camera's internal memory which is normally very small. Check which memory card your camera supports. Also, the size of photos varies depending on the quality of the picture and various other factors.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Suggestions...<br>  Download the pics to your pc, then format your card.<br>  <br>  Change the resolution so you can take more pics but the quality might suffer.<br>  <br>  Buy a 2G card, you can take 1000 pics with it.<br>  <br>  Perhaps it's only your internal memory that is full (if applicable). <br>  <br>  When in doubt get your manual out. They are a wealth of information.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	buy a memory card<br>  go to howstuffworks.com<br>  to see how they work<br>  the manual will tell you what kind to buy|`|X2FfM9oGaa	What's the size of the memory card, 9 pics only is pretty small, you may be using the sample memory card that sometimes comes with the camera. you are meant to buy memory cards with with more memory capabilities.  Also you can just download your nine pictures to your computer then later erase them on the card to free up space.|`|spwARELEaa	Your camera is probably set to take pictures using the highest quality option which then in turn creates huge pictures.  Try adjusting the quality to normal.  Good luck.  Or buy a new card.  A big one.  I have a 2 gigger and it holds thousands.|`|P6hmvWKmaa	tak out the momory card and keep taking pix <br>  <br>  thats what i do <br>  <br>  or make your pix in your camera smaller in the menu|`|dO0vTP7Gaa	I suggest you get a new.. camera, memory card, or just go to the place you got it and return it or ask costumer service
KZ1IbLQPaa	Here's the deal. My brother had the same thing happen to him. What he did was he went on the xbox website and found the phone number they said to call if you have any questions. He ended up needing to answer a few questions and needed to tell the person his xbox code. They did give him a warranty though he only had one ring. They e-mailed us a postal address to put on the box we shipped it off to them in. It ended up going to Texas to be fixed. It was all free and they apologized for the problems. He got his xbox back in about a week or two and now it works fine. He needed no receipt I suggest you do the same as my brother. Hope this helped :-)|`|q6uyloYdaa	Microsoft will still fix it for free even though you don't have the receipt. They will ask you for the serial number and stuff and they use that information to see when it was purchased.
XbEqcwuYaa	It would be extremely hard, considering the fact that the Wii GH guitars have a hole for the Wii remote to fit in. You'd have to do a lot of wiring and it would be really hard. So basically, you can't really do it.|`|q6uyloYdaa	I highly doubt you can do this. The Wii guitars require you to put the Wii controller in it; they don't work by themselves.|`|cO10thlnaa	Nope. There are too many differences in the construction and electronic hardware used between the two consoles' controllers. Putting a hole for the wiimote would mean cutting through the circuit board. Just go buy a controller for the Wii.
JTZ8rlVUaa	no
8cWXue35aa	Your town can house 10 neighbors total plus the 4 players. If you don't have 10 total animal neighbors more will move in at random and stay until they tell you they want to move out. If they are happy with your town they are more likely to stay. Even if they tell you they are thinking about moving, you can tell them to stop and they most likely won't go.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	just keep your town neat and clean, no weeds, no bugs. they will tell you when they want to move out, but you can veto their idea (reject). do not time travel, as they are more likely to move out.
O6iEFpreaa	DUDE SHE SAID AT&T NOT CINGULAR!<br>  its about $100 a month for my plan.<br>  I have unlimited texting and around 700 mintues a month.<br>  but, this is a family plan. <br>  I'd check out AT&Ts website...<br>  <a href="http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-service/cell-phone-plans/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wireless.att.com/cell-phone-s...</a>|`|MMIrGwDAaa	lol idk cuz i have verizon! O and btw u gotta get it!!! We can txt like 24/7 well i do!|`|0AbGj3BYaa	it cost $20 for idividual and $30 for the whole family<br>  <br>  baby just say yes, uhm cingular and at&t are the same thing, okay and she just said texting not mintures OKAY DUDE !?
Jk68yEu6aa	if i was you i would put it on ebay and have them bid on it.|`|VbD0kUeuaa	if you bought it for 300 sell it for 150 or less <br>  if you bought it for 200 sell it for 100 or less<br>  and if you bought it for 100 sell it for 75 or less.
5e564f59771ed76baf9cdea62df489eeaa	first of all you can not use at&t with sprint the technology is totally different secondly the quickfire is no longer available at&t pulled it if anyone has the quickfire and need a replacement they have to get the samsung propel.  now whether you can get it off some internet sites i am not sure. but you can not use it with sprint. only services that are interchangeable are at&t and t mobile and you have to get the phone unlocked to use it with the other provider.|`|W2YtVUqKaa	you can do that only if your phone has a sim card
pDcJGptPaa	If your lens has a distance meter (most SLR lenses do--SLR stands for single lens reflex), that should give you the closest focusing distance. It is a window on the lens with increments depicted in feet and/or meters. If you have a point 'n shoot it will usually be printed somewhere around the lens. Spread out some coins of different denominations out on a table and see what you get.|`|YYbaY6KRaa	Closest focus means the closest that the camera can get to the subject while it is still sharp and not blurred. When a camera is too close it cannot focus. Try something that has detail that is only visible from close up. Try the stamen of a flower.
qWicVoU9aa	All SIM unlock codes are tied to the particular device IMEI and are carrier specific. The request for that code would need to be made from the carrier that the phone was originally manufactured for. Each carrier has their own guidelines as far as what requirements have to be met before that code will be given out.  This is a free process.|`|RCdm5LzAaa	it's not free, but try here:  <a href="http://gsmunlocklabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://gsmunlocklabs.com</a>|`|epdHit4yaa	it's very affordable. try here - <a href="http://www.globalunlock.com/phones/public/search?q=tu515&btnSubmit=Go" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalunlock.com/phones/publi...</a>
8Ypkfr7jaa	Not sure if Sony Ericsson can do that..... I think Samsung phones can only do that.... But anyway, refer to the manula that came with that phone and look it in there.
hi1eqrXwaa	haha yea i had the exact same problem! i didn't wait and i now have the iPhone 3g. it's the greatest phone ever!! and if they do make a new phone, you can always download the new features for free. the actual phone itself probably wont look the same. but that doesnt really matter to me cuz i have a cute case for it anyways =) So, i would say GO FOR IT!! You'll love it!|`|aG7GTM3Haa	If you don't buy it now, you never will. go with your heart and go for it. It is a great phone. I have the very first and some of my friends have the 3g. The only difference is the looks other than that I find it to be the same. If a new phone is about to come out it would not be that much different. To see the accessories you can get for the iphone, go to <a href="http://valladaresonline.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://valladaresonline.blogspot.com</a> > Cell phone shop.|`|fxDQqDjzaa	Buy it now. No matter when you buy there will always be rumors of the next upgrade. i went through the same thing as you when I bought my iPhone. I was wondering if I should wait for 3G to come out. I did not wait and I am happy I did not. I love my iPhone and do not feel I am missing much by not having the 3G model.
Hjuh6PG0aa	Nope. 20 seconds is all you get. It sucks, that's why I got bored with my Sidekick 2008 after only 3 months. Haha
AZmh6efjaa	Yes, its possible.. You need to google the phone's model and find a program that will unlock your phone. (First, you need to format your phone though!)|`|RWX8w35Haa	you are confused by what they mean by locked. unlocking is when you can use the same phone on a different carrier. you sound like your being limited. and that must be an alltel thing. sorry, i doubt there any way around it.
tWoN22rRaa	Yes, this lens will autofocus on your D40. Just not as quickly as Nikon's version.|`|1b8gW3Dfaa	Will it work? yes. However it won't autofocus on the D40 because D40 has no in-camera motor, thus if you want lens to autofocus, you need lens that have af-s|`|403b9f9e4c28b14be7a2b7a4b1ea71ecaa	here's a website that has listed all the compatible nikon lenses
dGFqbjEnaa	my only suggestion is to take it to an Apple store.|`|IMwLQG1haa	are u sure your battery wasnt just low?
YIvIVvWFaa	Sorry, I don't know of any mysteries to recommend. The ones I've had were so simple that they weren't fun. But I'll tell you the ones I liked best. They're kind of old, but I enjoyed the whole Myst series and its offshoots:<br>  Myst, Riven, Exile, Revelation, and Uru, but I did't buy the last in the series, Myst V, End of Ages, because I read that it wasn't worth the money, only having one puzzle to solve in each section. A lot of the series involves puzzle-solving, but you have to do a lot of looking around and clicking to even figure out where the puzzle is, in many instances.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst_franchise" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst_franch...</a><br>  <br>  I also enjoyed The Journeyman Project, which has some things in common with Myst.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journeyman_Project_(series)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journey...</a><br>  And I liked Beyond Atlantis very much, especially the little music clips that play from time to time.<br>  Beyond Time was fun, too.<br>  <br>  I confess that in all the above, at times I had to resort to help from a walk-through, which you can easily find online, and in some of the Myst puzzles, I was really annoyed when I was doing the right thing, yet it took countless attempts before the game would accept the action and let me go on (like running from the base of a hill to jump up onto a rock, from which you can see and jump over to a paper with a clue on a nearby ledge--but even when you finally manage to get up onto the rock, you keep falling off). It seemed at times like the equivalent of being refused entrance somewhere unless you can hit upon the right secret gesture to make, but you haven't a clue what it could be. <br>  <br>  And right now I am playing The Longest Journey, an easier game,  <br>  but a little less enjoyable.<br>  <br>  To me, beautiful and fantastic graphics are a big plus.<br>  <br>  Googling PC games + mystery will bring up a lot of suggestions for games involving mysteries.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  Forgot to mention Roller Coaster Tycoon. You build an amusement park with various rides, decorate it with trees, flowers and benches and various food concessions, as well as setting up people to clean the pathways, etc., you determine how much money to charge for everything, and you try to reach a certain figure by day X of operations. It is fun to see the little people come in and line up for rides. You can also click on them to hear their comments about your park.|`|43iywBGSaa	grand theft auto!|`|s9d8I0Uaaa	give grand theft auto a try. very fun!|`|5b6c51bc38cdc1af6d0b4a46aa8b907eaa	have you tried the sims? <br>  <br>  also you could try bigfishgames they have hundreds of time management games, they have a membership scheme but you don't have to sign up for it you can try all the games free for an hour or play them online for free. also try Pogo they have a lot of those games that you don't necessarily need to have a full account for.

0rpN2419aa	Did you get your iPhone working yet?  I have the iPod touch and it didn't give me a message about a sim card,  but when I plugged the usb cable from the iPod to the computer, nothing happened.  Someone on here told me what to do, plus I called support and got he help I needed.  Yesterday, just out of curiosity, I went to http:// www.apple.com/support.  Since manuals do not come with the new iPod Touch, I wondered how they expected people to know what to do.  They ave online manuals for their iPods and iPhones that are reall good and might give you the help you need.  If  the online manual doesn't help you, then you need to retlurn the iPhone to where you got it and tell them that you might need a new sim card for your IPhone.<br>  Hopefully, it is working for you.  It's a lot of money to spend for something that isn't working.

hfGE5jieaa	Low battery, perhaps?
AA10775666	Most Nokia phones can't be charged using a USB cord so i'm not sure if that will work for you - but if you're willing to, buy a charger for your phone online and it shouldn't cost that much - there are also "adapters" that hold phone batteries and can charge them so you can use that too...|`|7hShYjKHaa	If you have a usb for the phone, you can link it to your computer and it'll charge or you can go buy another charger.|`|zxmfNzEWaa	yea some phones have usb portals, if your phone does your can connect it to the usb and charge it on the computer. <br>  <br>  or you can try this....im not sure it works but iv always wanted to try, hope i helped a little...:)<br>  <br>  Instructions<br>  Step1<br>  Get a USB cord and cut off the end that doesn't fit into a computer. Use your pliers to pull off and expose approximately an inch of wires. Use the knife and wire strippers to expose a little less than a centimeter of the black and the red wires within the USB cord.<br>  Step2<br>  Remove the back of your cell phone and take out the battery. Find the positive and negative signs on the back of the battery near the gold or silver metallic portion (the terminals) of the battery that connects to your phone. Remember that black is negative and red is positive. Place the exposed red wire over the positive battery terminal and place the exposed black wire over the negative battery terminal.<br>  Step3<br>  Place the battery back into the phone making sure the exposed red wire is on the positive battery terminal and the exposed black wire is on the negative battery terminal as you pop the battery back into the phone.<br>  Step4<br>  Plug the USB cord end into your running computer and let the phone charge for a few minutes. After a few minutes, unplug your phone and power it on.

Its really a great thing but you still need to pay your bill.<br>  <br>  However, since at&t is pretty annoying, they'll be down your throat to upgrade and whatnot or make you do something, you can ignore them for a while though.|`|ak0T96CQaa	You will stop being able to make calls and send text messages, I would assume.|`|MUVdG9n1aa	you just stay on as a customer on a month to month basis. It means you still have your phone service and can cancel anytime. They usually try to get you into a new contract by offering you a free new phone. You may as well stay month to month if your current phone is fine or if you can afford to just buy one outright, Then if you have to cancel you won't have to pay the fee.|`|RWX8w35Haa	Nothing, your now month to month. you can cancel anytime
w7Ffw6MYaa	The thing you are talking about is called Service Preserver. When you Top-Up $90 within 3 days, you will be eligible for this offer. All it does is guarantee service for a whole year without having to worry about Topping-Up. You have the $90 of course, but instead of topping up within 30 days its 365 days. If you run low on money, you must still add money to your account. And yes, text packs can be purchased with the Top-Up card money. I hope this clears up your question =)
GXMTwCLTaa	You should be able to call them, i don't know if they will help. They might replace it for less but i don't know if they will transfer you're data. Call them yourself and ask, if they say they can't help, you should probably buy another one for less on e-bay or amazon. Or it depends on how yours broke, if you think it will happen again get a cheaper one like iPod Shuffle. Other Ipods stink, the i-touch is the best. Back up you're data alot so if something like this happenes, you wont loose you're new music, apps or anything else. But if the warranty passed there will be small hope for a replacement.|`|frA6fwB5aa	It may cost more, but yeah.|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Yeah call them or go to an apple store, if the first answer dosent work for ya...|`|1b8gW3Dfaa	Bring it in. isn't there a 1 year warranty?

qGfAlDd2aa	The digital channels have been in the air since 2002.  If you connect your converter box or use a digital TV, what you have now is pretty much what you will have going forward.  There may be more sub-channels added in the future, but that is an individual station thing.<br>  <br>  At this point, all the "digital transition" amounts to is, we turn off the analog signals.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL ANSWER:  You should get a box now and get it working.  If Congress had not moved the deadline, you would be dependent on it now.|`|UinOWcMUaa	No, you won't get more channels but the way the channels are transmitted will be different. Instead of transfering your TV signal in analog form it will be transmitted Digital. Which basically is just a better signal, and transfer then regular analog. And is able to carry over better HD information.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.

Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera.

Camera prices at this link change often.<br>   <br>  What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices.

And if your phone does get fixed and you want to keep putting downlods in your phone then get a memory card with a lot of Gigs. Wish you luck!

o6BDapZjaa	You can indeed connect to the internet wirelessly with your BlackBerry 8900.  You'll need to go to the Setup application (the file folder with the little gear in the main menu, near the lower left), then go to the "Setup Wifi" icon (it looks like a router with a gear next to it - gears seem to be BlackBerry's way of talking about settings).  That will walk you through selecting an available network and entering the password or key, as necessary.  It should also store the profile for you.  This is the same process you'd need to use to set up a computer or any other device to "talk" to a wireless connection.<br>  <br>  The T-Mobile data network is accessed through a different radio on the phone; it's actually accessing RIM's network unless you're using the Blackberry as a modem.  You'll have to enable ANY connection on your phone; go to "Manage Network Connections" at the bottom of the main screen of icons once you've pressed the BlackBerry/Menu key.  The icon looks a bit like a martini glass (although I think it's supposed to resemble an antenna <grin>).  From there, you can turn off/on any of the wireless functions - wifi, bluetooth, or T-Mobile's mobile data network.  Always keep in mind that the appropriate service must be turned ON on your Blackberry to be used.<br>  <br>  They're just two different ways of accessing the internet, the difference being that for wi-fi, you must be near a wireless access point of some kind (either in your home, at a library, Starbucks, McDonald's, etc.) - usually within about a hundred feet.  To access the internet using T-Mobile's data network, you simply have to be in a place where you get three bars of signal strength or better from a T-Mobile tower, which is a MUCH greater area.

AA10775666	Take the battery out of your phone while it's turned ON and then restart your phone after a couple of mins and whilst your phone is turned off, take the memory card out of it and insert it back and hopefully that will solve the problem, and once the prob is fixed, make sure to change the settings on your phone so that the texts are saved into the device memory and also make sure to back up all of your data and format the memory card...you should also try restoring your phone back to factory settings if none of this isn't working by dialing the code *#7780#<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

R6sn6JlSaa	sorry to say it but the phone is gone and there is nothing you really can do about it unless you know who stole it|`|4cMuedpWaa	In order to have a 8900, you must be on a GSM network. So, if in the U.S.A., either T-Mobile (original carrier) or AT&T.<br>  <br>  While there is NOTHING you can do about your phone, your stolen sim card can be deactivated and the wireless carrier MUST provide you with a brand new SIM CARD with the same plan at no charge.<br>  <br>  Of course, you MUST go to the Police and report the stolen phone. Once you get your copy of the Police report, you can go to a T-Mobile or which ever carrier Store and force them to deactivate the old SIM card and replace it with a new one with the same phone number and services you had in the old one.<br>  <br>  I insist when I tell you that the CARRIER MUST provide you the SIM card with same phone number and features once they block the old one.<br>  <br>  If they don't do that, they are breaking the contract you signed therefore they are NOT providing you the service you signed for therefore you can sue them.

HVQFVtelaa	Any laser that would do what you want would be potentially damaging to the eye, if pointed directly in the retina. That's why you must be careful with them.<br>  <br>  I would use a helium neon laser for that, they produce a brilliant ruby red circle that has a long range while still keeping the spot small, and are visible outside, with a range across the street.<br>  <br>  The price would be lower now, but in 1980 was about $200. The unit was 18 inches long and about 3 pounds, and yes, required 120 volts, although now you could use a power inverter and a 12 volt battery.

ZtECjEPyaa	i used to have bearshare until i found out that it wasn't working for me either. instead, i just downloaded Frostwire and now i have 200 songs on my ipod! when you first download Frostwire, it will ask if you want to share songs from Frostwire into your iTunes library. Make sure you say yes/check the box! Once frostwire is completely downloaded, you can start to search for any song you want and download it to your frostwire library. when this happens, the song will appear in iTunes under SHARED DEVICES. When you see your song in this column, click on File (in iTunes), select Add File to Library, and select your song to open it. The song should then land into your iTunes library and once you sync your ipod, the song will go directly into it. Glad that i helped =].

WAgePXHHaa	What do you mean by a hard reset? Lately similar terminology is being used to describe different actions.  If you mean simply pulling the battery out, and waiting 5-10 minutes before reinserting, no, your contacts won't be cleared.  If you mean a reset via wiping the device, yes, your contacts will be cleared.  You'd need to first back up the device before the wipe.

You may also see rechargeable batteries with names like NiCD and Lion.  <br>  <br>  So far after purchasing several types of NiMH batteries, I find the Sony Cycle Energy batteries to be the best.

e2a308ea41a12b91b2df7078eb857c70aa	don't you hate it when they give you super hard impossible games like those that have no shortcuts or hints to them?<br>  well, at one point in the game, nancy goes to the ice shack and someone hits her with an iceball. but she manages to get to safety with a little help from the wolf who left her someones jacket to keep warm. then nancy overhears guadalupe and ollie get into an argument because guadalupe had been filling ollies gun with blank rounds so that he wouldnt be able to kill the wolf. Guadalupe leaves. At one point ollie tells nancy to go out and check if theres an avalanche and she gets stuck but the wolf helps her out. Nancy finds out that Lou had been collecting fossils he found from the bombed sights and confronts him. He admits to doing so but says that he was not the one who was bombing the places though and he leaves too. Nancy gets a letter from an anonymous person telling her to meet them in the sauna for a secret. she goes and finds pictures of a little boy with the same birthmark as bill. then someone traps nancy in the sauna and she is eventually rescued by yanni. she confronts bill about the pictures and bill admits that he used to spend his childhood at the resort. nancy eventually finds a shack far off from the resort where some guy had lived and trained the wolf whose name turns out to be isis. She was trained to do commands such as sit, turn, bark, etc. Nancy finds a passageway into an old mine and with isis' help they eventually go into another room with explosives. shes discovered by yanni who says he'll  go get help while nancy waits there. Nancy notices yanni dropped something and realizes yanni had set the place to blow up within a couple of minutes. she quickly gets out and borrows ollies ski mobile to pursue yanni. You know how at the end of each game, you have some task to do to catch the culprit? this one was to use the mouse to drive the ski mobile and catch yanni on his ski mobile. eventually nancy does, and everything is resored to order. but isis is put in a zoo or someplace with no freedom, the only sad part.

yotafojtaa	yes, definitely. I'm a self proclaimed couch potato, but I love playing Wii Fit - it's a lot of fun even if you're not the sporty type. There are some serious sports like long distance jogging, yoga and muscle exercises but I don't play on those, as I'm more in it for the fun. I'd definitely recommend it, but it's much more fun if more than one person uses it, as that introduces the competition element to get high scores!|`|i81cQUyhaa	Yes,it's like having Your own Personal Trainer|`|cjEZEyQVaa	it is if you like yoga or you want to do exersize otherwise its not really a game that you play for fun...but the ballance board can be used for many games such as wii music and skiing games...just depends if you want to spend ￡70 on exersize on a thing which is ment to be a GAMES CONSOLE
PIF4h7W6aa	Technically, no. <br>  <br>  However, I have read online that Apple can't check, or see that it was jailbroken previously, so in that sense, yes, it does.<br>  <br>  Basically. Jailbreaking voids the warranty, once a warranty is voided, it can't be unvoided (is that even a word lol?), but like I said Apple wont be able to tell it was jailbroken as long as you have it back to a normal unjailbroken firmware
HVQFVtelaa	It would be difficult to record real-time game play into your computer, I think that's what you are asking.

Digital is SD tv, not HDTV.  You still have to buy an HD tv to get HDTV.<br>  <br>  So they are just converting the signal type.  I don't know how this type of conversion can translate to control.  If the govt. wants to control us, our tv signal type doesn't factor in.<br>  <br>  The cell phone and emergency people are buying the old analog signal bandwidth and using it for higher powered cell phone applications and the emergency people need more channels for helping people.<br>  <br>  The economy is horrible with or without signal conversion, it has nothing to do with the economy.

Wifi is just a wireless internet connection over a short distance. It isn't like a cell-phone connection, which is everywhere.  Wireless routers are connected to an internet connection just like your home network .  Most people don't like it when other people use their internet without permission. (or they want to have a secure connection).  Therefore, every password-protected wifi station has its own unique password that only the owner and people that the owner wants to use the network has.  Free-wifi is provided at most coffee houses and some fast-food places. You can set up your own wifi connection if you buy a wireless router and hook it up to your internet. Or you can just use a wifi transmitter adapter for your PC|`|oJO7jr3Faa	if the router is at your house than your router is locked and u need to find out the password..if u cant i guess u should call the router compant...if the router isnt yours there is no way to find out the password other than asking the people ;)

QXEtJntsaa	no or yes or just read my info<br>  i hd 2 do a report<br>  <br>  LimeWire and other file-sharing software are legal. Using it to upload or download copyright protected media -- music, videos, images, software -- without the copyright holder's consent is illegal because it is theft. <br>  <br>  Here are more opinions and tips: <br>  <br>  <br>  LimeWire says it is legal because technically it's just a "file sharing" service and it is not held responsible for the files that are downloaded onto the system. Only the users are responsible. That's why, when you download songs from LimeWire, it's legal for them, but NOT for you. <br>  <br>  Don't be fooled by the fee you pay to use the PRO version of LimeWire. The artists of the songs you download don't get a penny of that! ("LimeWire offers two versions of the software: LimeWire Basic which is free of charge; the other is LimeWire PRO which costs a small fee, features faster download speeds and better search results, including up to 6 months of free updates and customer support via email.") <br>  <br>  Even if you download a coyrighted song for your own personal use, it's still illegal. Perhaps one could skate around the issue if they already own a legal copy on a CD, but then why download it if that's the case. Any fees paid to LimeWire are for purchasing the software and that's it. <br>  <br>  LimeWire is not illegal software. All it is is file sharing. However, many people abuse this by sharing songs without the copyright. For example, if you have produced a song and then share it on LimeWire, anyone else can legally have it for free. But when you haven't made it, but an artist has, who has copyright on that song (which they all do) downloading that song without permission from the producer is totally illegal. <br>  <br>  Downloading songs and other copyrighted material is illegal, but if you wanted to share a music file of you singing or playing an instrument, then that is perfectly legal. <br>  <br>  LIMEWIRE IS ILLEGAL! Although, with LimeWire, you will probably never get caught, if you as much as bring your computer in for a repair and a worker sees the program or any music you downloaded from LimeWire, he is ordered BY LAW to tell his boss, and you will get a fine (I had to pay approximately $200.) It's not pretty. Although we all want LimeWire to be legal, it isn't. <br>  <br>  The LimeWire software itself is not illegal -- that is why the site is still up and why you can still download it. However, if you download a song from the program and you do not pay copyright on it, that is illegal. Songs from the 1950's (or before that date) are legal to download because their copyright has expired. Anything from after that is illegal to download. However... You are all going to do it anyway, so this is just to make you aware of the legal situation! <br>  <br>  Is LimeWire illegal? No, it is not. It CAN'T legally be held accountable for what its users do. Let's put it like this: A major virus takes out the whole of the Internet. But when they trace the source, it leads to Runescape servers, for example. Runescape is an online game that gives its users access to its servers, kind of like LimeWire. Now are the people who own Runescape responsible? Nope, but its users ARE. Same thing with LimeWire. My advice to you is this: Do not use it to access "free" music, or "free" programs... images... and so on and so forth. I have had my fair share of songs I got from LimeWire. And if I could, I would return them to the artists and companies that worked hard to make them. <br>  <br>  Here is some info regarding P2P software and file-sharing. If only people would just take the time to read the fine print. I've visited the websites of a few popular file-sharing software distributors and looked for disclaimers, TOS, End User Licenses, etc. I have only quoted bits of relevant information to give you an idea of what to expect. For more detailed info, follow the links I've provided or visit the sites yourself for the full text. Continue reading to see what I found. <br>  <br>  LimeWire itself is legal. Downloading any copyrighted song that you do not pay a royalty fee on is illegal and is stealing, unless the artist has given his/her permission to do so. The legality of most P2P sites is questionable, at best. Will you be prosecuted? More than likely not, but the question of legality is another matter. This entire issue has not been resolved as of yet. Could you be prosecuted? Possibly. It is your choice. Agree or disagree, this is how a friend of mine -- a lawyer -- explained it to me. <br>  <br>  It's been said again and again. Yes, LimeWire is legal. But not everything you choose to do with it is.|`|UF9MVdSXaa	Well the software it's self isn't. But when you download a song it is! Limewire is stupid and it sucks!|`|6OzEsanAaa	yes and no<br>  its illegal because ur getting free songs! <br>  but no because its like asking for a friend for a song and then they send it to you through the internet<br>  so in a sense it kind of is! but no its not|`|3piD14gAaa	Yes, the free or the paid version of LimeWire is illegal.  Don't use it.  It'll get your computer viruses and in the long run will "kill" your computer.

uQisF0zkaa	The arcade is the cheapest ($199.99), it comes with:<br>  Arcade System<br>  Wired Controller<br>  256mb Memory<br>  Arcade Game<br>  Standard Cables and all that crap<br>  <br>  I think that's it. However, It would be probably be cheaper to get a Pro (60gb HDD) because the Arcade doesn't have a HDD (Hard-drive) and you can't really hold a lot of data, so you'd probably would have to spend another $100.00 for a 60HDD. I personally like the wireless controllers too, and the Elite (120gb HDD) and Pro look better to me. The Arcade does what it does, its really meant to be a family console, or for a VERY casual gamer. I'd recommend a Pro.

I wouldn't recommend getting a touchscreen, I've heard they're easily broken. Best of luck!

6P27whuGaa	Pretty much everywhere except the Apple Store sell them lower than the original price. I bought my iPod Touch there but I got a discount because if you turn in an old iPod or other Apple product. you get 10 percent discount which helped some. The lowest price in a retail store was in Best Buy, it's 284.99 but it's on sale, so I would hurry and get it, I would check Walmart too, since they are a little more cheaper, 297.97 and Target is regularly priced 299.99 for 16 GB. There are more stores but those are the stores I would check first.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	go to one of those open air markets near where you live. you can bargain and get it for a low price. otherwise, the only place left to go is either Walmart or Target. The prices are lower than at the Apple Store.
hMo9z0TSaa	Maybe you dont have service|`|SYYfqoxCaa	I've been having issues too, but not with all videos.  Some aren't able to be played, some are painfully slow and others are just fine.  Not sure if Apple needs to put out another update or what.<br>  If no videos play for you, I'd suggest emailing support and asking what's up.
6P27whuGaa	Yeah, you can download the old iPhone for free (it's 10 bucks for iPod Touches to be upgraded with the iPhone software) and also you will be able to go on the internet but have to be somewhere with Wifi, like a cafe or restaurant. Here's a link to help you upgrade the iPhone because I can't explain it.<br>  <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414?viewlocale=en_US" rel="nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1414?viewl...</a><br>  <br>  This should help you upgrade.|`|8cG6OTcsaa	Apple are cgarging 10 to upgrade the itouch but iphone is free. Just plug into itunes and click update, as simple as that!!
RDFkpq0Oaa	After you've tried the hack once in the game, it'll go away. You'd have to go back and re-copy it to your Wii from the SD card.<br>  <br>  Make sure your downloading the right hack for your Wii firmware (a 0.1beta1 hack for 3.3 won't work if your Wii is 3.4)<br>  <br>  Look on the shiny side of your disc, and there should be mini letters on the small inner ring<br>  RVL-RZDE-0A-0 JPN    TwilightHack0<br>  RVL-RZDE-0A-0 USA  TwilightHack0<br>  RVL-RZDE-0A-2 USA  TwilightHack2<br>  Just remember to load the right hack when you start the game.|`|EpvHhbByaa	I would tell you just how to do it.

nMf7kSsBaa	I live in South Carolina and when I shipped mine out it was all next day air with UPS.  When they are done fixing you PS3 they will also ship it back next day air with UPS as well.  So you really only have to wait one day when I they are done.  When I sent mine it I got it back in about 5 days, which really surprised me.  I will bet you have it back by next week.  I can only speak from experience, which means it did not take long at all I would say 7 days at the max.  I am assuming you shipped it to Texas correct?|`|PFLFEhVRaa	My PS3 blu-ray laser went out so I had to send it in, and in total my PS3 was gone for 17 days.|`|fWclxi9Baa	yeah you do ship it to texas but i havent really seen the yellow light on the ps3 how did it actually happen
