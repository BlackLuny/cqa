JI3uGeiyaa	The answer is that the consistency of the base and slope relates to speed ,subsequently relates to the shape of the river and finally the dispersing of sediment.    A narrow river with the SAME VOLUME as wide river in hard ground ,cuts deeper and is faster,tends to have rapids ,so sediment is dispersed further away the river also is more straight.    In soft ground the river meanders more and cuts wider,  Sediment is dispersed on the bends,    The Mississippi is a perfect example of this  slow meandering river, dispersing at each turn   cutting the elbows deeper  , and so in the process making eyes or islands with the sediment it deposits .    rivers like in the grand canyon are examples of hard ground ,fast rivers with rapids and the sediment is deposited further away where the river again starts to meander.    So in short   the degree of meandering relates to the amounts of sediment  being deposited.|`|AA11130104	I assume that the particles you're talking about are "suspended sediment".    The width of the river channel is a factor of the volume of water in the stream, and the slope of the river channel.  To my knowledge the width of the channel does not affect the deposition of sediment.    The shape of the channel does, the velocity of the water does, the volume of the water does, the slope of the channel does, but I'm not aware of the width of the channel having any affect.

KzuF9D4maa	Nice to see another meteorologist on the Answers page.    Climate impacts the large scale patterns of meteorology over the globe, but has generally been hard to measure because of the lack of data spanning more then 100 years.  Sure climate is a big factor in forecasting, but right now the global climate models don't translate the global patterns into local patterns and weather phenomena very well.  The problem with finding climate patterns in the measured data we have is that over the past hundreds years, there has been a tremendous increase in the number of monitoring stations, as well as, the implementation of satellite and radar data.  So where we see an increase in the number of storms over time can be called a false positive, because we've had a corresponding increase in the number of observations recorded.  Until there is a better handle on the concept of global warming, I would say that it is overused for current weather events.  Actually there should be more focus on the variation in extreme events.  After all, if the concern is that the average temperature of the planet is increasing then we should also, in theory, be seeing more warmer heat waves in the summers.      Anyway, currently yes, it is overused and it's not helping with getting the general public to understand the concept.  Not exactly helpful in forecasting current weather either.    Good question though, makes me wonder if I might have run into you at the AMS meeting in Phoenix a couple weeks ago.|`|AsKWImpQaa	It's absolutely overused, mostly by skeptics on here but also by uninformed believers (e.g. the columns about Katrina being caused by AGW).  You can't infer climate change from individual weather events, although climate change may change the frequency of such events over the long term.    People need to learn that their particular weather doesn't say anything about global warming.  Longer term events, such as drought over a period of years may indeed be an indication of climate change.|`|CnQdSPLJaa	no because it's the first time we're getting record numbers in temperature (125 F in South Carolina), glaciers melting away at an alarming rate.  it has a direct effect on what's happening as we speak, it's because of global warming|`|5cb5feb035bd6f8ad961e6c52149cc41aa	EVERYTHING is overused for current weather events now by meteorologists.   BLIZZARD coming!!    No, it's a little bit of snow, not a blizzard.    I remember as a kid if channel 2 said we were going to get an inch of snow and channel 5 said we were going to get 9 inches of snow we'd all believe channel 5.    Now everyone tries to scare the people as much as they can and they overdo everything.|`|m5FyTeYgaa	As a meteorologist you know the answer. climate and weather are related but different phenomena. Global warming, or climate change, is measured over years or decades. Weather is local and measured in hours or days.    A big storm in Chicago means zip in terms of global warming.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Actually, I'd say it's underused, if anything. The reason is that legitimate scientists--and meteorologists--are going out of their way NOT to ascribe too much to global warming.    Granted, every time we get a severe storm ( nothing new there, of course) somebody asks if it's due to global warming. And answering those questions means someone is always talking about the topic.    And getting misinterpreted. Time after time I've heard a scientist answer some question with something to the effect" The weather system you are talking about may be influenced by global warming. But we don't have evidence to say so with any certainty" And then gets misquoted as claiming that "global warming caused" what ever storm, etc. is the buzz of the day.

9fbe56a44d7b6024062aa6bacbc528e4aa	He's not climatologist, he claims to be a meteorologist and with a lack any information relating to his academic history provided on the internet, including his own web site, I have my personal doubts about his qualifications as a meteorologist.   He apparently attended the University of Illinois, but there is no indication that he ever completed anything relating to atmospheric science.  Wikipedia was the only place I could find that lists him as completing an unknown degree in 1957.     If you look at the way he is presented as  37 of list of usual suspects in climate denial The Manhattan Declaration, he is in fact not even presented as a meteorologist, a climatologist or possessing any degree from undergraduate to post graduate.  Others on this list provide who and what they are, but Coleman is simply listed as     Founder, The Weather Channel, Weather Anchor, KUSI-TV, San Diego.  That's it!    Coleman's only obvious connection to weather and climate is as a TV weather reporter and simply being the founder of the Weather Channel and when it comes to climate science being a reporter of weather really means nothing.  If the man had anything of value to add to climate information one might think he would tell his actual qualifications, if he indeed had any.|`|AsKWImpQaa	I think it can actually be one of the harder places to forecast, because it's so much on the tail end of storms that it's difficult to tell what's going to happen.(Of course most of the time nothing happens)    I'm in the San Diego area and watch him occasionally.  He's entertaining in his goofy way. He asks "weather questions" on his show, and more than once I've had to correct him.    I think he knows enough about climate to know that San Diego is a nice place to retire, and still work a little bit. He doesn't know enough about it to have a clue about global warming, though.    EDIT: Jim Z, I thought I was being nice to J.C. in my post. If you really want, I might be able to dig up the email from a few years ago where he says I'm right and he's wrong. It was something about maximum rainfall years from San Diego, and he got it wrong because he failed to research it completely.  There are other times I've corrected him but he has not fully understood what the problem is with what he's said--those times it was a lack of a science background.  It's happened more than once and I rarely watch him these days.  He's entertaining, he definitely has some knowledge of meteorology, but he's not an expert on meteorology or climate science.|`|68a986852f756433d4bb1ec748016462aa	You are simply engaging in ad hominem attack.

I personally think that weather forecasting is the most useless profession in the world. They go to college to learn the "science" then have access to the latest technology, and they're still wrong 50% of the time.  The only thing they usually get right is predicting a hurricane will hit land, and even then they usually screw up the point of landfall.   I think weather forecasters should be held accountable for their work...every time they get a forecast wrong they should lose a finger, then toes, then legs/arm/etc. And they'd do it on TV.  At least then they'd be entertaining.

However there are lots of things that can, and that evidence is why 95% of the climatologists believe that global warming is real and man made.     No, it is not my opinion in regards to extreme weather. I would doubt that anyone of real understanding of climate change would agree with that.     Finally, it's not true that our winters are getting colder and snowier. As a matter of fact, we had a long string of warmer winters before the past two.

But notice the qualifier.....it only uses energy when you open the valve and water flows thru it, tripping the on switch. Otherwise it is inert.

We buy cheap single use items to save time and it is filling our landfills. In the landfills surrounding LA we have seen an 80% decrease in construction waste due to the housing slump and a 30% in household waste due to the average family cutting back on spending. We close a full landfill at the rate of about 1 per day. CA leads the nation on recycling, with around 50% diversion rate.     I personally have found it is easy to reduce the amount of waste and recycling by eating a healthier diet. The majority of my food is fresh produce and meats so there is little packaging.

fp9bOiVFaa	Here's the problem with that: thermodynamics. Basically, putting a windmill on a moving object will create drag. That drag will mean increased work for the electric motor to maintain the same speed. More work for the electric motor means more energy used, and you've just basically canceled out the benefit of generating electricity with the windmill. At best you're going to come out even but in the real world you'll actually use more electricity and run down the battery faster due to inefficiencies in the windmill.|`|AA11289359	Keep trying some day you will get their.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	There is no way to install wind power generator on a small movable object like a golf cart, because you will never get exposed to enough wind to be producing any electricity.  A wind turbine cannot be moved and has to be idle and the fins or the fan is installed at great heights, at least 20 feet minimum to be exposed to as much wind as possible so that it could drive the turbine and produce electricity.|`|sfC6L8ybaa	Surely you jest.  Never heard of perpetual motion machine?  Everyone here would gain if only useful questions were submitted.|`|ryjnt3dhaa	There is no such thing as a perpetual motion machine.|`|LvWIIJD7aa	ahh not so good since most golf carts are electric they just get plugged in and they are charged no need for a wind power generator.you have a better chance with a hydrogen fuel cell.i did this thing too back when i was in high school what i did was start a business that will equip any car with the costumers choice of fuel source hydrogen fuel,solar panel or add a plug in for their car.

Heat your garage so you can work on your cars (and other gas-guzzling toys, like a boat and maybe an ATV or two!) year-round. Buy your wife a big azz SUV to match yours, one big enough to pull the boat up over the mountains.     That's what I've done, so far (except I don't have an ATV).|`|9b0cad68a36e4bab7dceabd66a337aa3aa	Just live like Al Gore does...Gore paid nearly $30,000 in combined electricity and natural gas bills for just his Nashville estate in 2006.    And that's not counting his other houses his cars & private jets.

It would be wonderful if we could warm ourselves out of the next ice age but i doubt that is possible given today's technology.  It isn't worth it to blow money on energy so no,  there is nothing you can do.
