0KmJwYunaa	Sorry, I don't know of any boutiques that sell teens or adults.   However there are plenty that sell other things.
AA11452852	No one will pay for "re-used" peanuts.  There just isn't enough demand for shippers to go through the process of weighing and measuring what people bring in.  However, UPS stores and private "mail box" stores will often take them off your hands if you just want to get rid of them.  Not all of them will even do that, but it is worth asking if you have too much to just throw away.    I know you wanted to hear a different answer, but I hope this helps!!
bxlYleZkaa	Don't bother. Go to France or Germany.|`|x0flaLfUaa	I don't know why you'd want to come here, its sh?t.

AA11452852	In California you need a work permit until age 18, so yes, you need to get a work permit.    You say you are not in school because you don't have your transcripts.  Under the law, that is not an excuse.  California law makes school attendance mandatory unless you officially drop out (DON"T!)l.  Go and register at your local school, and let them request the transcripts.  Every day that you stay out, you fall farther behind.  And you need to get the work permit from the school anyway, so there is no way to stay "hidden" if you want to work.    I hope this helps.  Good luck!!|`|lzEuuseJaa	Listen to cloothe  = )    This website from the CA Dept of Ed explains work permits:   http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ct/we/wpfaq.asp    My nephew worked without a permit at 17. And his scummy employer ripped him off, required him to work longer hours than is legal, etc.

AA11452852	The price for recycled scrap aluminum has gone way down lately, because the economy is down overall.    The current prices for scrap aluminum vary with the kind of aluminum product and the amount you have.  Auto transmissions are a category by themselves and sell for about  $0.07 a pound in less-than-truckload amounts.  If you fave a truck load, you can get $0.13 per pound.  Other scrap aluminum price range from $0.02 to about $0.60.  Again, it depends on the exact items and amounts.

9xbpCS46aa	well i think from what you have said is that you haven't got a filter or only have a broken or bad one. if that is not the case then i would suggest that you wash your tank and replace water more often
RnjuNJ6faa	There is a few steps worth trying :    1. Install a water pump and filter. You can get this in most aquarium shops. Just let them know how big is your fish tank. Some filters are better then others. If you have budget, get those sand media filters.    2. Do change the water inside the tank frequently. Depends on the kind of fishes, sea water or pond water fishes. Depends on the bait and fish food that you feed. Never feed excessive food to the fishes. It will contaminate the water if too much is left unfinished.    3. Remember to remove any dead fishes, dead baits or dead seaweeds or water plants.    Gd Luck

3mAgM405aa	If anyone conducts a google.com search for "green leaf legal services - rip off, scam," they will likely bring up only 8 search results and none of the results make a clear statement that it is a rip-off or scam operation at this time.  Again, before engaging their services, ask for references and speak to other satisfied clients of green leaf legal services.    Good luck!

9d9b36b9e6361692e8f905e814f617dfaa	Todo depende de dos cosas que hay que considerar en la cotizacin.    1. Monto de los ingresos anuales de la empresa.  2. Carga de trabajo    Pidele a tu futuro cliente que te permita revisar de forma selectiva su contabilidad, busca entre sus plizas el recibo de honorarios o la factura del actual contador, una vez que la hayas encontrado puedes darte una idea de cuanto le puedes cobrar en relacin a lo que viene pagando.    Soy auditor y fiscalista, por eso se me permite entrar a la contabilidad antes de que contraten mis servicios profesionales.    Por ltimo, los $1,000.00 que pretendes cobrar y que ahora estas consultando, en un futuro cercano si te capacitas puedes recibir mucho ms que eso, el secreto esta la calidad, resultados y confianza al cliente del trabajo que lleves a cabo adicional de la relacin que entables con tus clientes.
