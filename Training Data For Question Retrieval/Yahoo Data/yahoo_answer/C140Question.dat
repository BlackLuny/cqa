20090205034014AAVjAcW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Whats wrong with my baby?	Last Sunday she turned One. Monday she had her 12 month physical and I opted not to get any shots yet because I had a feeling she was getting sick. Just a feeling, no symptoms-odd. Weds I started introducing whole milk (she was on breastmilk till 7 months then organic soy formula)Thurs night she had a fever of 102, same all day Friday. Sat. morning no fever but had diarrhea. Saw the dr again. Doc thinks viral, but I'm not so sure. That afternoon the fever came back then went away that night but the diarrhea reoccured on and off. One poop would be just soft and the next would be diarrhea.  This continues to this day (Thyrsday again). So it's been going on for one full week. Plus some nights (like last night) she awoke CONSTANTLY. I thought maybe her tummy hurt.  Any ideas what's going on?  Am I overreacting? Help!
20090205033355AAMlXvI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Help with ideas for boys names...?	Can anyone help me by suggesting some names for boys?  If we have a girl we're naming her Ella Janet Louise (after our grandmothers), but if it's a boy we're having, we can't decide.      We don't want a name that starts with a J, K, or C, due to the large amount of people in both our families who have names which start with those letters.  We love simple, classic names, for example Joel and Colin but of course those have J and C.      Any suggestions would help us a lot!  Thanks!

I have just read the most horrifying comment from a Grandmother on here saying that it is an "opposite sex thing" and because she doesn't understand them she finds her grandsons "cute".  Thus implying that she doesn't find her granddaughters cute, as she does have some.      Now, I don't have any girls, but, I think if I did, I would love them just as much.      Is it easier to love boys than girls?

20090205040841AA5JAbM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Doesn't this make sense if you really think about it?	People say children and teens feel this sense of entitlement for everything under the sun.    But parents and adults walk around feeling like they are entitled to respect.       I am 19, so I am neither a child nor a parent but I am adult.       I see so many adults demanding respect and so many parents expecting their children to respect them, simply because they are adults or parents.       Personally, I think if anyone wants respect it should be earned. Yes, that goes for parents as well.       Most these people that strut around demanding respect are total douches. Yes, even some of those parents.       I don't think that just because someone is a parent that their kids should show respect towards them especially if they don't act in a manner that deserves respect and yes, parents can act towards their kids in ways that don't deserve respect.       Some of these parents act like total clowns and then feel the need to be respected.       I think parents should set example and act appropriately because sure your kids can do whatever you say but they could think of you negatively and not have any respect for you but wouldn't you rather act like a human and get respect from everyone because you acted in a way that earned it or would like to throw your little diva fit and demand your respect because you think you are entitled to it?      Just looking for your two cents on this.

20090205040500AA32h74	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Therapy and adoption?	Doing research, so would appreciate if only those with experience reply. If an adult was abused as a child, then decides to seek professional help as an adult to deal with pstd or anxieties, would this be viewed negatively if said adult decided to adopt? Meaning, would the adoption agency view the adult's childhood as a negative mark, opposed to not revealing those facts at all (and thus, not seeking help).    Thanks

Jacob is solely on baby food right now...with the few exceptions that we give him a taste of our food sometimes if it is mushy, fruit in his mesh feeder and the pancake he tried earlier this week.       He only has one tooth and doesn't feed himself yet..but I'd like to stop the baby food or at least decrease it until he eats regular food well. He also eats Baby Yoplait yogurt which I feed him myself and he loves it.       What can I do? He eats the baby food really well and sometimes eats like 4 oz at a single serving so I don't want him to not get the food he's used to getting by switching to real food.       Lay off the formula/breast milk is all they need drama..I know he needs still mostly formula but he's used to solids too now and I want to keep it that way.

I notice he was waking up too so I grabbed a bottle and ran it under hot water and fed him. Later at 5:45 am, I changed him after he was crying (mind you I couldn't go back to sleep since the first time). Then at 6:30 am he's crying again so I give him another bottle but this fool will drink some then start crying again. I blurp him almost every time he stops so he can't be gassy. What is wrong with him?   I have been woke since 4:30 and I went to sleep at 12 am cause he was whining around 11:00 pm too.   Any advice and suggestions on how to avoid this is greatly appreciated.      Thanks in advance.

20090205042342AA2Pa1T	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do you say to your son when his father has abandoned him?	I was left in pregnancy weeks from getting marriaed, this wasboth our first child and we were both with good jobs in our thirties (him nearer fourty).  Anyway was left in pregnancy and havent had contact since, no christmas cards etc.  I get child support through the csa after a long battle and a dna test.      However, my son is a toddler and will start asking soon what is it best to say?  Was thinking your father was not very well (in the head) and was not ready to be a father.  He has an odd relationship with his mother who is extremely needy and maybe saying your father's mother needed your daddy more. or How about your father is sadly a very unwell man due to the terrible selfish and immorale standards inflicted on him by his parents,which have left him with an unhappy life. Im sure he would of been a great Daddy had he not had such **** parents himself.      It is really hard there is no way of dressing it up it will leave a child feeling rejected and worthless.  I have no other male role model for my son and have never dated since mainly as I was so hurt by the way my ex behaved and terrified of putting trust in anyones hands now that I have a baby.

I went to the Dollar Tree to get a test the other day & a woman with a toddler son was grabbing a whole bunch of tests. She said, "I love these tests! I can get like 10 for the cost of 2 elsewhere." and I said, "I've heard they're pretty accurate." Then she told me, "They take a long time to show positive. I took one 3 years ago & it was negative. My husband saw it on the counter the next morning & it had turned positive. That's when I found out I was pregnant with him (her son)."      I always heard that you shouldn't look at a pregnancy test after 10 minutes. Which is it? The reason I asked is b/c my period is due in 2 days & I took a test last night and... this sounds weird, but I could see a "clear line" where the 2nd line should be. It was darker than the rest of the test, but not really pink. It was very light. This morning, in that exact spot, it was POSITIVE. I took another one this morning w/ FMU (first morning urine) and it looked the same as the one yesterday. I've never had one get an "evaporation line" before. So I'm just not sure... thanks!

20090205050403AAfrZGj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Anybody had a transverse or oblique laying baby?	I'm 37 weeks and since week 28 my baby has been in the head down position.  My last mw appt was 3 weeks ago when I was 34 weeks and was head down then too, but since then I've been feeling the kicks in different places.  I'm pretty sure my baby is now sideways or shoulder presenting.     I've always had the big strong kicks under my right ribs and still am, but I'm also getting quite big movements on the left side now too.  My bump has been lower for just over a week which I thought was baby dropping, but I've read somewhere that baby can seem lower if laying sideways.  Last week I was also feeling a lot of pressure down there but even that feels a litlle less now.  I can feel squirming down low rather than kicks or prods and what feels like a big butt under my right ribs.   If anyone's had a transverse or oblique laying baby could you tell me where you felt all your movements and kicks and how far along you were plz?  Were you given any advice to turn baby? When do they schedule c-section if it is sideways?

20090205045727AAkDuoU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Stay at home mums and the money?	Just wondering..   I recently read the opinion that the money my husband earns is his money because he's the one that works for it. Personally, I don't think he'd do as well at work without the nicely ironed clothes I provide, the healthy meals, the emotional support etc etc, and if it weren't for me, yes he would probably still be a good earner and a hard worker, but perhaps would have missed on a couple of promotions.    Has anyone got some interesting insights into this? Or stories of their circumstances?   Please note this isn't a dig at my husband, he's great at his job - but I'm bloody good at mine too although I don't get paid for it!
20090205051044AAZ3Cx4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Have you ever had Fifth's Disease while pregnant?	I went to my midwife last Friday because I had the flu, cold, sore throat, ect. She checked my throat and said it was just "viral red," and didn't do a culture. Now nearly a week later I'm not sleeping at night because my throat hurts so bad. I'm going back to the doctor today. It doesn't look like strep, and i remembered that my now 5 year old niece had it when she was about 8 months. I know that when you're pregnant you're not supposed to go anywhere near that disease.. if i have it will it seriously harm the baby? Any personal experiences?

Then I all day and well into the evening, mostly until around 8 pm, I just feel like I have the flu.

20090205050111AAApbkR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	How to deal with friend's helicopter mom?	My friend has a helicopter mom who has basically taken over their life.   My friend moved away from home when they found their first decent job a few years ago. Since then, they lost that job and went back to school to pursue a new career. Being unable to keep up the rent, my friend's mom insisted on taking care of half the rent so my friend could concentrate on school.   However, since they started paying half the rent, my friend's mom has basically taken over their place. They've removed any trace of my friend being there and replaced it with their own decor, from posters on the wall to books in the bookcase. Their mom is also extremely jealous about other females in my friend's life, friendly or otherwise.    She claims she does this because she is looking out for my friend's best interests and believes that females only serve to distract my friend from their path she has planned for (my friend)'s life.   She drops in unannounced and spends her time there closely scrutinizing anything my friend does, claiming whatever my friend does will reflect how people think of her.   It's basically like my friend has never left home, even though they have their own place, my friend's mom has made sure that her presence in their life is absolute and unquestioned.   My friend has completed school and upon passing the certification exams necessary for their new career, plans to find a new job and move out, but recently stated to me they're worried about what their mom will do if they leave, stating that they're unsure if she can care for herself.   Is there anything that can be done about my friend's mom?

I'm not trying to start a debate here, just want to hear other people's opinions.      Say you have a single mom who receives food stamps, medicaid, child support, and rental assistance.  She works, but only works enough to pay for her children to be in daycare during the day because she has 5 kids total and can't stand to be at home with the kids.  She then goes and files her taxes and gets to claim her income, daycare and children and receives almost $10k back in a tax return.  She doesn't have to claim the food stamps or rental assistance or other benefits received as income, obviously.  If she did, of course her return would be significantly less.        What do you think of this situation?  Do you think it's right that this person is basically using the system to live and then getting away with almost $10k more of gov't funds in her tax return?

My son was still getting up 1-2 times at this age, but it was because he was teeth and getting his 2 year molars.  My daughter wakes up and drinks 8 ounces of milk every time she gets up.  If I don't give her milk she will not go back to bed.  I have held off for 3 hours in the night not giving her milk, trying to get her to sleep with out it and she would not.        She eats great all day, including starting dinner about 2 hours before bed (it usually takes her half an hour to finish eating dinner), with some cheerios or goldfish and a glass of milk right before bed.  My only thought is that her body might crave the milk at night knowing she needs it?  Because all day long my daughter refuses milk.  She demands water, and if I don't give her water, she drinks nothing at all all day long.  So then in the night she wakes up asking for milk and will not settle until she has it!        I am so tired!  I can't keep doing this! I keep trying to get her to bed with no milk in the middle of the night, but I can't keep staying up 1-2 hours each of 3 times a night, just to give it to her in the end anyway.  I have a son who is 33 months old and he wakes up no later than 6am every day regardless of what time he goes to bed, and my husband leaves for work at 5am, so I have to be up with my boy.      Any advice on how to get her to drink milk during the day, and any ideas on how to get her to stop waking up to drink?  I know she isn't hungry when she goes to bed.

I look at my mom differently and i understand why she was and still is overprotective of me (im 20 now). Do you look at your parents differently since you had a child? Do you understand where they come from now?
20090205064458AAEBcqT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is it harder to raise a son than a daughter?	I have been told that its easier to raise a daughter because of course you can relate to her and understand her feelings and all of that and when it comes to raising a son i have been told its harder to relate to them and if your a single mom you really cant fill in the shoes and be a father. Is this true? (i have a 3 month old)

Will that be pretty accurate?

20090205060235AAnwsdn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is there anything I can do?	Well, Im 14 weeks now, and up until 12 weeks i had bad nausea at night time, but after 12 weeks it started to g away (thank goodness bc it never did with my daughter) But now, since monday I have been getting these horrible(right in my forehead and eyes) headaches. Ill get a glass of water and 2 tylenol (or my husband will lol) and drink the water and take the tylenol. It never works. Here's what happens....Headache..nausea....gurgling tummy...throw up. Horrible to the point of massive dry heaving. It's usually in the morning, so sometimes I have food on my tummy and sometimes I dont, so I dont think it matters either way. I throw up any medicine i take (tylenol and one time phenergan, cant keep either down long enough to work) This all happens in 30 min- to an hour. After I puke my ever livin guts out i do feel better but i still have a little head ache.         is there anything i can do? The headaches even wake me from a dead sleep.

20090205061051AAh3VQB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How do you politely tell someone?	its a friend of mine, not real close or anything because I saw what a user this person was in the beginning. She always wants me to watch her kid. I am a stay at home mom and since I don't work I guess she figures I don't do anything and can watch her toddler anytime. She calls alot and I will watch the toddler and she has never paid me. Also she barely works so sometimes I watch the toddler and she is just shopping and what not. When she works she will leave the toddler and go home do whatever then eventually comes and gets the kid. I am not going to just watch her child all the time and change diapers and feed the toddler my food all the time like this. I don't answer the phone sometimes but it will lead to her driving over and then asking me. I have never asked her to keep my child. There is so much more to this story but you get the picture. I am not the type of person to just say no and that be it, I mean even if I said no she would be like well what do you have to do? WHy not? I don't know some kind of suggestion would be nice. Also she leaves the toddler for supposedly an hour or two and won't be back until evening and her phone always "runs dead" and I can't get ahold of her.

I've tried to stop taking it numerous times and as soon as I stop I'm right back where I was at the toilet!

20090205063609AAiMJCh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	I feel like a bad mother.......?	My life is falling apart, and the one most affected by it is my baby boy.      Ever since I found out my husband had an affair, I've been dead set on divorce. I feel there is no way I can recover from it. The way it happened and the pain I felt and am still feeling, I know our marriage would never be the same. And I don't want to live that way. Suspicious every time he leaves the house, doesn't answer his phone, comes home a little late, it would make me crazy. So I know, despite the promises he's made and the pleading he's been doing, that I will never be happy with this man again.      But what about my baby? My son who isn't even 2 yrs old yet and doesn't understand why Daddy doesn't come home every night. My heart falls into my stomach every time he starts walking around the house calling for daddy. Bangs on the garage door calling for him, thinking he's out there working on something. I feel like I have failed him.       But isn't being a parent all about sacrifice? Do I take my husband back and sacrifice my own happiness so my son can have his mommy and daddy at home every night? Would that even be the best thing for him in the long run? I just don't know what to do anymore.      Someone please tell me the right thing to do, because I just don't know.......

I'm trying to get my degree in English and then continue to law school and I swear everything is working against me. My boyfriend and I just got engaged, however we also found out that I am pregnant! I'm 20 weeks along now and we're scrambling to come up with money for a place to live and grocery bills, baby stuff, medical bills all sorts of bills! I tried to get the medical card to help pay for what my insurance doesn't cover and I can't seem to figure things out! Nobody is being helpful at all and I don't know what to do! I work, I pay my bills, I have insurance, and I'm going to college. Yet I can't get a little help to pay my medical bills whereas there are these nasty hoes who pop out kids all their lives, never get jobs, and get EVERYTHING handed to them! My school is a 45 minute commute and it seems like all we've gotten is snow snow snow! I have missed so much class because of doctor appointments and just being sick. Now I have to deal with my car not handling the snow! I've wrecked it twice. Not badly, but gotten it stuck in a ditch! Now it is stuck IN MY DRIVEWAY! Only in my drive way but I can't get it out! So I am missing class again! I can't handle all this! How do you other people deal with life constantly throwing you ****?

20090205054111AAcoWPs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is there anything wrong with carrying a small baby in public without a car seat or stroller?	My son is four months old and weighs over nine pounds (He was 3.5 pounds at birth). He is still working on his head control…I can’t afford to buy a stroller. I have to take him back to the hospital where he was born (over two hours away) for follow up appointments (usually twice a month).      I’m tempted to bundle him up warmly (two layers of clothes, socks, a big hat, and a fleece blanket) and carry him inside without the car seat. I like the convenience of being able to set him down in his car seat, but I hate stopping every 20 feet to rest, and my hands get blisters.       Can you think of any downsides to carrying him around besides not being able to set him down? I know that people used to have to carry babies around a long time ago before car seats, but it just seems weird to me.

20090205063910AAE8qiE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Any one any opinions on TV watching for babies?	Having worked with children before I had my baby, I was always telling parents that children shouldn't watch TV endlessly etc and quoted the current research.  My daughter is 9 months old.  We watch two shows together each day when I have time to sit and interact with her (Cbeebies-Something Special and a Mickey mouse one) which she loves!  Just in case any one thinks I am totally against TV. She also sometimes watches a DVD for 20 minutes to let me have lunch etc.        I am having an ongoing argument with my partner as he likes to have the TV on all the time.  I find my baby is constantly looking at the TV and doesn't interact as well when its on.  I also think that when she's older she'll be able to understand the shows he is watching and I'm not fussed on her watching news shows about all the crazy, bad things that go on in the world or shows with adult themes- I am a believer that kids are only young for such a short period of time and that they should stay kids as long as possible.  I also don't want her watching kids TV shows all day long which my partner would let her do if I didn't intervene.      Anyone any ideas?  How do you regulate the TV your baby watches and for how long?  I am not against my baby watching TV-just think there is a time and a place!  Or am I totally over reacting?
20090205065055AAUHiOI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Gave birth 8 weeks ago. Symptoms of being pregnant (again?!?)?	I don't remember how my first period after giving birth was with my first child. As stupid as it was, my husband and I had very brief intercourse without protection about 4 weeks after I gave birth. (TMI, but we got a little carried away. I decided we should stop fooling around because I don't want to be pregnant again right now.) Well, about a week ago, I spotted for a day or two. I thought it was my period starting, but apparently it wasn't.      So, my question- is this spotting normal? It crossed my mind that it could possibly be implantation bleeding. I know it's extremely easy to get pregnant right after giving birth. Should I wait a few weeks to see if I get my period OR should I go ahead and get a pregnancy test now?

My mom used to abuse me, and my dad wont even let me leave my rooms at times. I'm seeing this girl and i'm gay, and he hates me even more for that fact.

20090205063525AAMrXF8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnancy worries, advice please?	I am currently on the pop pill in which i take daily and takes my periods away.So i have no bleeding however that is not my concern as i have taken this pill for the past 4 months and have taken it before in the past. I have always been careful with my pill however can recall few times in the past few month missing one or two by accident due to me working 12hr nightshifts and my bodyclock being awol and ive just litterally forgot or thought id taken it.   I have never had a pregnancy scare before untill now and its symptoms that are alarming me. I have noticed a pattern of symptoms occur over the past 4/5 weeks. especially breast tenderness and tingling and size. They have gone up at least a cup size and my right one is much bigger than my left this is one of the first changes i noticed , however thought it may have just been the pill, but as time went on i noticed neasuea associated with vomiting.(not regularly) every other day then more frequent ,i went out for drinks with friends last week and after 3 drinks i was ill vomiting all nite after that. Ive also began to notice constipation at one point i went 6 days. And also little othe things like spots on my face ( i rarely get spots) mood swings (my boyfriend gets the wrath of them poor thing) and tiredness. Not so much tired now but when i think back to about 4 weeks ago i was falling asleep at the drop of a hat. Where i litterely couldnt keep my eyes open. The past week i has came to attention that i may actually be pregnant but as the symptoms were happening gradually i thought nothing of i untill they started to continue and alltogether. Are these signs others have had? and could i be and could there be other explinations like the pill or stress? I have ordered a test in which ibeing delivered in next few days. I am nevrvous as hell to take it as i was not planning children for a while yet, thanks xx

20090205053444AAjELws	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My 6 month old baby has started to refuse foods, any suggestions?	My 6 month old began eating jarred foods from about 5 months. He ate well and almost all flavours. Then he began refusing them totally. I tried for a while but then thought best to leave it. Now i have tried with making my own mash, carrots etc but he gags then wont even open his mouth. He would only eat a banna and apple swirl flavour but i turned to the organic jars as i dont want him getting a sweet tooth. Again he was taking creamed porridge and creamy rice but now again he is refusing. i blame myself though because i didnt start him gradually on baby rice, i was just that enthusiastic when he started eating that i was giving him all different kinds.   He doew enjoy his milk and think maybe it may be best to leave him for at least a month or so. Any suggestions??

20090205053907AAVCpa0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Just to say hallo to you all and some clomid quiestions too?	Hello ladies,    I'm still here.. I have been away for few days for work.. hope you are all ok..    Today my period has arrived in full.. :*( I knew it was coming.. as I ovulated on the 21st Jan and my leutal phase is alway around 14 days.. well I start spotting last night.       I knew I was not pregnant as I ovulated on my left side, where my tube has been removed.    Well now.. I'm getting ready for my next ovulation, hopefully it will be on my right side where I still have my tube.. so hopefully in about 2 weeks time I will have my chance again.. also the 18th Feb is our 3rd wedding anniversary and the 19th we are flying to South Africa on holiday to visit my husband's family for few weeks.. I cannot wait!       If this time is not right I think the Doc is going to put me on clomid from the following cycle..   I know more or less what clomid does but I still have some doubt…  Does it make you ovulate from both side each cycle? Or 2 or more eggs from one side?    When do you need to take clomid.. How much do you need to take? For how long? do you get a regular period when you are on clomid?    is it true that you dont get mucus while you are on clomid? but do you get temperture shift?       sorry I have so many questions.. any advise will be appriciate but only serious answers please      Buby dust to you all! :) ciao

My husband and I have been trying to conceive for about 6 months now. My cycle is never the same amount of days. Last month it was 26 days and this month it was 33. And it mostly stays on 7 days, but sometimes 5. But I never really know when I am ovulating. We have a 2 and a half year old daughter. It took us about 5 years to conceive her. We are thinking about trying fertility drugs. The last time I got a PAP done, she told me my cervix was tilted. I had to put my hands under my butt so that she could find it. This was about 2 months ago. I was also told the walls of my uterus were thin. Whatever that means.

I have been for a scan and baby looks healthy still eating from the yolksack as my placenta will only form at 11 weeks.  But though I am spotting (luckily by now less than monday) and I have abdominal pains every so often, is it safe to make love still?  I feel he is becoming very disappointed that I keep turning him down but he is not saying or showing this, obviously trying to be extra supportive.  Also, my nausea, which has been almost unbearable up to now, is mysteriously gone today (touch wood), this could not be some sort of warning sign, could it?      I am sooo paranoid now after all this stress of spotting and given how desperate we are for this little baby it's so hard to think positive.      Any advice and help on above questions and having a more positive frame of mind would be much appreciated.

I've spoke with the gyn/ob about it and the baby is already used to my medicine from me taking it so long carrying her.

20090205065048AA4FQua	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	She lost because of her name!?	okay so i entered my daughter in a beauty pageant (she's 5) please don't judge! but anyway she lost because of her name... It's Justin. Yes i understand its a guys name but i grew up with the name Amber and hated that there was 6 other kids named Amber in my class so i decided to give her something different. But back to the story first of all they refused to call her Justin they were calling her Justina. then when i made a comment that her name was Justin some guy said "Trust me if you want to win call her Justina" I was like WHAT that's no her name! so during the last round when they called her Justina i stood up and said very loudly her name is Justin. which was fine they went on with the pageant calling her Justin... then they announced the winner (not her) and then i got her score sheets for all the rounds and she had all 10s and a few 9s but then the last round she had all 5s and 6s... So i assume she lost because of her name! What should i do about this?   but also i was looking at her and i starting to think shes WAY to pretty to have a guys name. So does she look like Justin fits her...    http://s681.photobucket.com/albums/vv171...    thanks

It hits me hard to think about this and I just wanna cry for her. She's only 7 and I'm feeling so much pain for her. I was really close with this little girl because I used to watch her for her mother.      From what her mother has said, this little girl explained things that were done to her that almost no 7 year old I've ever known could possibly know about, which makes us all think even more what she's saying is true. She's talked to a therapist and they've started the whole process of pressing charges, but my question is, how can a child fully recover from this? Can they?...Can a child who's had something so horrible happen to them, fully recover or ever trust someone again?...Mind you from what she's told her mother and therapist it was two older men. What could be in store for this poor child?

Ok..So I went to see my endocrinologist yesterday about my pituitary tumor.My prolactin levels are back to normal...he's checking agian to make sure..but the reason they were high was from a bipolar medication called risperdal to begin with. Anyways he checked my breasts to make sure they weren't leaking milk since people with my sort of tumor have that sometimes. And nope they weren't.      But he did say that they were really firm..he was surprised they were real and he guessed it was because he's use to touching older womens breasts and younger womens are usually more firm. ANYWAYS...he said they seemed full as if I was pregnant so he wanted to do a preg test just in case.       What's that about? I mean I want a baby more then anything but I havn't really had a period in ALONG time...and I don't think it's because I'm pregnant, my boobs hurt but I think it's cause the bras I wear or something. I don't understand how could he think I might be pregnant when my periods hardly ever come? I told him this too!      Then he said if I'm not pregnant he might put me on something called metaformin or something because he has a feeling I could have PCOS.      So my question here is...how does metaformin work to make your periods regular? and how the heck could he think I'm pregnant just by feeling my boobs! Could it possibly be from the prental vitamins I was taking?
20090205082016AAYwcoh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I went to see a doctor yesterday to confirm my pregnancy... ?	It wasn't my OB doctor and it seemed that he didn't know much about pregnancy issues.  I told him i been having this discharge over the past 2 weeks that didn't itch or didn't have color in it but it had a weired smell to it.. He didn't even check me down their and he just per-scribed me Metronidazole and Miconazole Nitrate Viginal Suppositories.. I will be calling my regular doctor to see if i could take this medication either way.. But do you think its ok for any pregnant lady to take them even though they are in their first weeks which is even more critical for the baby...

20090205071813AArpqRv	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Miscarriage.. Could I be pregnant again?	This is complicated and I know nothing about M/C... I found out I was pregnant on the 23rd of December, then I lost my baby Jan 6th at 6 weeks pregnant. Well my husband and I continued having unprotected sex. We had sex about 4 times that week before he left. I have heard to count a miscarriage as a period because you still ovulate 14 days after bleeding begins. Which would have made me ovulate around the days we had unprotected sex. My other question is... I've heard having a M/C makes you more fertile.. is that true? Could I be pregnant again?

So thanks to my other answers sorry if your answering this for the second time...      Okay so I gained 26 lbs during pregnancy. At my 6 week PP check up I have lost it all. I've lost 7 lbs since then but my stomach isn't any smaller but actually looks bigger since my 6 wk pp checkup. I am guessing I am bloated... Did anyone else have this problem? Its kind of annoying... Since I am loosing lbs and it looks like I am gaining lbs...Weird huh?      I am now 9 weeks pp, and actually have been cramping on and off lately.- don't know if this has something to do with the bigger belly.      ***At 6 weeks pp my belly was smaller than this.Thats why it makes no sense I only started looking bigger in the past few weeks.      ***I am pretty sure its not my period or ovulation, because I am pretty positive I just finished ovulating.      Any advice??? thanks again.

I'm not a parent (yet) and don't plan to have children for a couple of years but I have friends and relatives spitting out babies left and right LOL.  For some reason, I thought of a conversation my mother and grandmother had some years ago about me.  My mother said that I was colicky (spelling?) for 3 months straight and she blames it on my grandmother because my grandmother told her to give me "cereal" with my "soy milk" (formula perhaps?) and that I was too young to handle it.  So, my questions are:   What is colic?   What causes colic?   Are there any cures for colic?   And, lastly, is colic genetic?      I'm not completely unfamiliar with babies and baby related or parent related terms.       Thank you all for your help!

I should deliver within the week!!!      BUT..... If I show up Wednesday pregnant, she wants to go ahead and induce me on the 14th (funny huh? I keep hoping for then). I'd only be 38 weeks exactly, but because of the swelling (not pre-eclampsia but its pretty bad at times) and the contractions, she think it may be best.      I'm torn between saying yes and no! I know its better for him to wait to 40, but with all the little problems I'm not sure it's actually better for the both of us. I also know it ups my chance of having a section, but she said its only really when your cervix isn't favorable, which mine is very much so....      So, would you schedule the induction on Wednesday (for the 14th) or just wait it out?....

In my family (i have over herd conversations) that one wouldn't allow his/her daughter to do the same things as their son would. ill use myself as an example. yesterday i had to use my mom's car to just run to fed ex and to the store and she told me to hurry up, and text her when i get there and when im leavening. but if my brother wanted to use her car for the same reason she doesn't question when he will be back and doesn't ask him to text when he gets there. im almost 21 and my brother is 17. why is that?      since i have a son do you think i will let him "get away" with things just because he is a boy?

20090205071903AAT2Hxd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Has anyone ever asked their doctor/midwife to sweep their membranes?	I have an appointment tomorrow and I'll be one day shy of 39 weeks.  My midwife said if I make it to the appointment, which I just know I am not going into labor anytime soon, she is going to schedule me an induction probably for that Monday.  So I was thinking last night that if I am dilated at all tomorrow if she could try and sweep my membranes.  I mean its worth a shot right?  I'm going to have him one way or another and I would like to have him in spontaneous labor.  The reason for being induced is that he may be on the bigger side as he has been measuring 2 weeks ahead for like 3 months and I had an ultrasound that said he measured 7lbs 12 ounces a week ago and of course that can go a pound either way.  The tech said she definitely thinks his weight is more on the heavier side because of how much "meat" he had on him.   This is my second baby and I did have my membranes swept with my first and I ended up being induced a week late anyway, but it might work this time.  Has this helped anyone go into labor?

20090205083907AAGS54k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How do I get my daughter to drink from a sippy cup?	My daughter is a little over 10 months old. She doesn't like juice. Sometimes I can get her to drink it but other times she refuses. I've given her formula from a sippy and she drank it once she realized it wasn't juice. I know she needs to be off the bottle by a year old. I just need help. I don't know if I should just give her formula from a sippy and not push the juice or if I should keep a sippy near her filled with juice just in case she wants to drink it. Normally when I give her the sippy cup she chews on the spout. She has her front eight teeth. So please give your advice....I am a first time mother. Also about finger foods...any advice on how to get her to eat them? I tried today and she just wanted to play with them. So I picked it up and put it in her mouth and it made her sick. It was the gerber graduates puff banana flavored.    Thanks so much!!

20090205073857AAZFRKL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	We are having a girl, and all of a sudden my husband is upset she's not a boy?	I'm 36 1/2 weeks. My husband is acting very strangely. We wanted kids, so yes, this baby was planned. He told me over and over again he didn't care what we were having as long as she was healthy and happy. I felt the same.  When they told us she was a girl on the ultrasounds, I think I saw a twinge of sadness on his face, although he denied it and said he was thrilled she was healthy.    This past month he has been acting very strange. He doesn't touch my belly or talk to it or sing to it. I showed him the gifts from the shower and he didn't care. He actually said he didn't care. He won't take me to look at baby clothes, and when we do go past the racks he goes straight to the boy's section and touches the little argyle vests or whatever and gets a wistful look on his face.     Yesterday he said out of the blue, "I want my little boy." I didn't know what to say. I said, "you'll have one! We want more kids, remember?" and he said with a very sour face, "You KNOW what's going to happen." I said, "What, we're going to have three little girls?" with a laugh. And he said, "yes." And he said it pretty bitterly.     It made me feel so bad. We've talked in the past about how either sex would be wonderful...he doesn't seem excited about this pregnancy at all. Maybe this is his way of expressing stress or having cold feet?    I just worry that he's going to keep on acting this way after she's born and it makes me want to cry. What should I do? I'm trying to be excited...and I am...but this almost ruins it. We were supposed to be enjoying this, we waited so long for her!

The problem is I'm TERRIFIED of singing in front of people I know. I'm fine with concerts because I'm singing in front of people I will most likely never know or see again.      Another reason I'm terrified of singing is because on my birthday in choir I had to sing the birthday song in front of the class and I sung it totally wrong and utterly embarrassed myself. And then yesterday I bombed chior auditions which was just in front of the teacher and song the wrong lyrics and all the wrong notes. I'm scared to even sing on the phone for my friend.

20090205070408AANRB7G	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How much would you pay your childcare provider?	I run a small, in home daycare.      My hours run from 7:00am-6:00pm Monday-Friday.  I charge a flat weekly rate, which includes all hours for which I am open.  Whether your child comes 20 hours a week, or stays from open to close every day, the rate is the same.      A parent whose child has been with me for almost 2 years e-mailed me this morning saying she is having a big schedule conflict and is forced into some meetings that are about 1 1/2 hours away.  Once a week for the next 12 weeks, she needs to drop her daughter off at 5:00am, 2 hours before I open, and then pick her up right at closing (trying not to be late.)      She asked me to tell her how much I wanted for the extra hours (if I were able to do them.)  How much do you think is fair?      Currently, she pays $150 a week for the care.

Had sex the 23rd and 24th and again on the 31st, ovulation came in the 26th.. ...according to ovulation charts, I did the deed on the days I needed to in order to get pregnant.    Not due for AF til Feb 9th so I am 4 days away. I been noticing signs in me that point to pregnany, I think...boobs hurt, headaches, that impending feeling of nausea that had me shuffle to the bathroom yesterday morning thinking I had to puke but I didnt. Now the feeling stays with  me all day and into the night. My mouth is so watery that if I dont watch it I leak when I speak lol, and have that feeling on my tongue where everytime I rest it against the inside of my mouth and gums, it feels like Im sucking on tin foil. Im peeing a lot and keep waking up in the wee hours of the morning when really, Im hard to get up.  I took a test yesterday, BFN...today I am 10 dpo took another test, BFN...I know every woman is different, but based on your experiences, how do you think 10 dpo is too early? I used a First Response test.       Im so damn anxious and feel so dissapointed when I keep seeing these negatives ... especially when I FEEL pregnant.
20090205070957AAWQvIJ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What movies do 14-16 year olds like?	I'm helping my sister out by supervising my niece's sleepover (I'm 19). The girls range in age from 14 to 16. What movies do you recommend for them to watch? They have to be appropriate, but I still want them to be fun movies (...not a kid movie). It would also be nice if it was a movie that I could enjoy as well, although that isn't as important.   Thanks!
20090205085234AAookOr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	How do i get a social life?	I'm 16 and I haven't had a social life in over a year. When I was 14 I had this friend who I used to be with all the time, but we're not friends anymore. And I have only got people I hang out with in school. And I have been bullied before so I don't really like the people in school. And my school friends are not people who like to do stuff on the weekends. I'm just tired of being home all the time, and not going out like a normal 16 year old, what do I do?

Did you set your safety policies because of your area or based on the news you see daily? I see so many people saying the world is a horrible place now compared to before.

20090205083307AAyuP1l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Should I give her a birthday card?	My friend and I had a fight. I haven't spoken to her in about a year. My husband hates her too because of what all I've said bad about her. I feel bad, I really don't hate her. But she was pregnant at the time and a year has passed and I wish we were friends again. What can I do to win back her friendship? I have her email address and I've apologized but, she still won't talk to me much. But, I know she is probably busy with the baby. Not sure. She gives me mixed signals. Out of anger, I sent her all the pictures of us together throughout the past 3 yrs and told her it hurt to look at them. I told her if she didn't want them to trash them because I didn't want them back. Anyway, her birthday is coming up on the 16th, should I send her a birthday card? My birthday was in January and she didn't send me one. I sent her a Christmas card but she didn't send me one. I'm tired of doing everything but, I'm hoping one day she sees that I have changed and we can rekindle our friendship. Please help. What should I do? Should I give up on the friendship?
20090205073901AAJkP6o	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Do you miss being pregnant?	So my friends think I'm weird but occasionally I miss being pregnant.  Not 8 months pregnant and swelled up like an elephant, but the earlier months.  I am lucky and had an easy pregnancy, no morning sickness and no complications, so maybe thats why I'm okay with it.  But my baby is 4 months and I must admit that sometimes I miss being pregnant and getting to feel his kicks. I definitely don't want another baby at this point but I loved my pregnant belly before it got too huge and just enjoyed the extra attention and special care that a pregnant lady receives.  Does anyone else sometimes miss being pregnant?
20090205065234AAtlmQw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	OPK's confusing... positive from a clearblue blue line test and negative from reliable internet strip?	i had a positive surge test on an internet strip evening of the 30th Jan, morning of the 31st Jan. negative ever since but seeing EWCM which makes me think O is later than the 1st February.   took OPKs today. got a surge line on CB blue line opk and then used a generic pink line opk strip (always been reliable in the past). Strip test had a 2nd line that was nearly the same as the test line but not quite what I consider a positive. My positive on the 31st was much much darker than the control and was the only positive in a bunch of negatives so I guess I have to go off that one?   has anyone ever had ewcm for 3 days after O?   EWCM is only in the mornings in a big clump. it is then watery in the day and is getting less and less.
20090205083259AAcEQ78	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Please help... why is my period so short?	Well, AF came the afternoon of February 3rd and seems she's already almost gone (just some spotting left, using a pantyliner). Sorry if TMI... but, I've used a total of 4 super absorbency tampons and 2 regular absorbency tampons since the afternoon of February 3rd and now I'm down to pantyliners. So, in essence I only had about 36 hours of actual flow and then some spotting. I took an HPT on February 3rd as well and BFN, so I don't think that's the problem. Plus, my cycle has been lighter and stranger like this for a few months now.       Anyone else experience something similar? Anyone else have such a short period and successfully conceive? Why is this happening? Does this indicate a problem or should I be concerned? Any advice and input is more than welcome!       Thanks so much ladies!

20090205071009AAVxdLi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Ok so I want to eat healthy for the baby?	I normally don't eat veggies or all fruits.  I only eat potatoes, corn, peas, grapes, bananas, apples, lemons.  I tried eating different types but just end up getting sick.  I don't know if that means that the baby doesn't like the stuff or what and I asked my doctor about and she just told me to stay away from things that will make me sick but how do I know the baby will be healthy.  I have only been drinking water and non carbonated stuff because I want to atleast be somewhat healthy and I feel so bad that I can't be 100%.  Are the prenatals going to pick up the rest of it and make sure the baby is ok or is there something I can do.  I hate cooked veggies and fruits too by the way and I can't drink thick liquids so I have no Idea how to get it all.  I even tried the V8 stuff and didn't happen.  What can I do?  Did anyone else have this problem?
20090205072910AAV0O5z	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Head not engaged yet?	I'm almost 40 weeks pregnant with my second baby and his head hasn't engaged yet. I know this is quite common for 2nd babies so I'm not worried about that BUT I did go into labor at 37weeks for 3 days, his head was RIGHT there, and he decided to float back up and stop my labor. I got to 3cm and 70% effaced but the hospital policy is not to augment/induce labor until 4cm or 39 weeks. I had my doctors appointment yesterday and she said she can't even feel his head anymore when she does an internal exam. She couldn't even strip membranes. She told me that the baby's head needs to be sitting right on my cervix for any effacement or dilation to happen... is this true or can you dilate and efface without a head sitting right there? My first baby never engaged either but I did eventually have her vaginally after being induced.

20090205065202AAzeqjk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I'm only a few weeks pregnant & so scared of miscarriage b/c im bleeding?	Good morning!    Ok so I just found out that Im 1-3 weeks pregnant. I had blood work done & my HCG levels are 220. Is that normal? I'm not familiar with HCG levels? My main concern is that I'm spotting. Red blood. I look at all these Q&A's on here & every1 is saying if u see red blood thats really bad BUT my doctor told me that some women bleed in early pregnancy & that as long as i dont have really bad cramps im okay.    I'm scared as this is my 1st pregnancy & we had been trying for 13 months now. We are so happy yet nervous & scared b/c i don't think if everything was ok i would be spotting would i? It's not a super lot BUT its enough that everytime I pee some comes out (not clots just red blood like when ur on ur period) I hate going to the bathroom for fear of what I will see.    I know I just need to relax. the nurse told me if i were to miscarry there is nothing they can do this early to stop it. Is there anything I can do? I have a desk job so I sit most of the day. Thanks :)

20090205072149AACOMlR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My neice is currently being raised by her grandparents and calls her grandfather dad. Is that normal?	Here's the whole story:   My neices mother keeps saying that calling her grandfather "dad" is unhealthy and confusing. THe thing is, no one ever told her to call him dad... and the more she keeps telling my neice not to do it, the more she does. The grandparents have talked to my neice about her father, who is not in the picture so, she knows who her dad is.    I can't find anything online telling me it is psychologically unhealthy or confusing. So, is this normal for a 5 year old girl? Her mother has now called dfacs on the grandparents for this reason, which is silly, in my opinion, but now they are really worried about the situation.

20090205084031AAGzvNo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	18 weeks, not felt any movement yet any need to worry?	This is my first baby and i am 18 +1 weeks pregnant. I've heard that baby's can be felt between 16-22 weeks, so its not as if i have passed those dates. I am a natural worrier and a miscarriage with the pregnancy before this one only added to the worry in the beginning of this pregnancy. i was so relieved to see my baby at the scan at 10+5 weeks, once i got to 12 weeks i was glad that miscarriage had a much lower risk. I heard my baby's heartrate at 16 weeks, and the midwife said it all sounded good, i had my downs results and they were low risk, so so far ive had an easy running pregnancy with everything running smoothly, but now im waiting for my scan in 2 weeks and im beginning to worry again, i was like this with my first scan but was fine when i came. i havent yet felt the baby move, and my sister has had 3 girls and said she didnt feel hers until 21 weeks at the earliest. im not a petite person, and am carrying a bit of extra weight so i dont know if this could effect it. i just wanted to hear from other pregnant women, or mums and if they had the same worry, or did they feel their baby late? just for reassurance.   thanks in advance x

20090205065324AAP80Da	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Ever heard of a child holding BM's and wont do them in toilet but only in a pull up, she is 5 yrs old?	A child at age 5yrs old and will not have bm's in the toilet.  She really strains to have them sometimes cause she can hold them till for up to 8 days.  She is on a stool softener already per her doctor.  She never ever does it over her fathers house when she visits every other weekend, she will hold it till she gets home and then all breaks loose. I dont know how but she does.  At the age of 2 she was fine and then the only thing I am aware that I can tie into it is she fell in the toilet at his house, Im just unsure of the story but ever since that happend she will not go in it, she will urinate, but not the other. I have tried stickers, told her she could have a kitten once she can do this task.  I have tried hiding the pull ups and seeing if she would go then, when I did that she said she didnt have to go anymore and she held it another whole day, I couldnt do that twice in a row.  I dont know what to do.

Then the next morning I took a test, 25mlU/ml, @ 4AM and it had a faint positive line, then I took another one at 8AM and it had a very dark line. Later on that day I got my Hcg levels drawn @11AM and it came back 70.6, is it normal to go up so quickly??

20090205071314AAlx52y	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	D&C Dec 9th, 1 normal period, could I be pregnant?	Hello all, I had a D&C on Dec 9th when I was 8 weeks pregnant and after 2 US it was determined that there was no cardiac activity-therefore it was not a viable pregnancy. I had a normal period on Jan 9th, and started having relations with my hubby almost daily for the week of the 17th. Anyway, my cycles used to be 26 days long-always. I have no idea if the D&C is going to change my cycles (it took 31 days to have a period after). I took a home pregnancy test today and it was faintly positive. If my cycles are still 26 days, I would have gotten my period yesterday. Is it possible that I am pregnant???
20090205071618AAq60wO	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Husband and I are TTC we need some info?	Hello my husband and I are ttc we started trying in Jan but we assume that we tried to close to my period last month so here is what we are doing and for you all that know if its right or if this works let me know. My last period was Jan-24th the one before that was Dec,24th and the one before that was Nov,26th so my period is usually on time maybe a day or two late but i have the period cramps and everything even if its late. So we did one of the fertility calendars and one said one thing and the other said different so we just picked one and went with it which was the 2nd through the 7th so as of the 2nd we have had sex AT LEAST every other day if not every day and yesterday we tried in the afternoon because we were told the sperm count is higher in a man in the daytime. I put a pillow under my bottom and stayed in the same spot for at least 5 min and didn't just right up and go clean up or pee i don't know what else to try anyone got any idea's that might help improve us to have a baby?
20090205071640AAJMUwN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this a good reason not to have kids?	I'm 24 and I decided not to have kids because:   I was born with a lot of life altering medical problems that I didn't get from anyone else.  I am also born with a horrible mental illness. OCD.    I do not want to risk passing along my medical and mental problems to the child.   Example of medical problems:hearing loss and not being able to reach puberty until age 23 because no estrogen is produced in the body unless you take birth control pills.      Also I don't think I'm mother material because I'm better at being an aunt.  If I babysit my neices and nephews they don't listen to me so I have to call their parents for help.

20090205072932AAStI3g	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	TTC help, please ..........?	I stopped taking birth control back in Sept. My cycle was always 28 days. Oct was 36 (which I wasn't surprised any that it was so long, being the first month off BC), Nov was 34 and Dec was 32. So it seems like my cycles are getting shorter.. Is that normal? Are they trying to get back to 28 days? I was supposed to start Mon the 2nd, and haven't (Mon was day 32). We aren't trying to get pregnant, but aren't avoiding it neither. If we get pregnant this month, it'll be surprising. If I don't start by this wk, would it be safe to test next wk? When might I get the most accurate results? Also, I haven't cramped any.. I've only had a sharp pain here and there on the right side, near my abdomen. What could that be? I ALWAYS cramp at least 1 to 2 wks before I start.. I haven't had any cramps whatsoever.. I'm hoping this is our month!!

I am a new first-time mom to a 3-month-old and am curious about when to start my peanut on cereal. She eats 6 oz of formula now every 3 hours. She spits up some but seems pretty content on what we give her. When it's close to bedtime, she might not even finish her whole bottle. She is pretty consistent the rest of the time. I have heard that starting before 6 months is not good because of the digestive system not being able to handle the cereal, but I am more concerned that she is physically able. What did your babies do that made you think it was time to try cereal?

20090205080619AAoWxPp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Do you ever just want to rush in and take a child in your arms and protect her from everything?	I feel so bad for my fiance's daughter. She is 3 years old and has been given entirely too much. She was born to an irresponsible teenage mother who has been arrested countless times, caught with pot and alcohol, and has had sex with more guys than anyone can keep up with. Her home life consists of her mother, her mother's new boyfriend (who got her pregnant AGAIN a few months ago) her mothers sister and brother, and her grandparents. Her father (my fiance), yes he was an idiot to get mixed up with this girl, but he has loved her since she was conceived and he was forced out of the picture. He has tried for her entire life to send gifts, money, letters, anything to see her. He called so many times they blocked his number and it was all for no reason. He didn't do anything. Her grandmother was just caught cheating and has been kicked out of the house so the little girl is having temper tantrums and anxiety attacks with all the changes. On top of all this her father is finally 18 and we have filed custody papers and a request for a paternity test so her mother is going insane and telling her all sorts of bad things about her daddy and saying that he is the one who is an a** for wanting to take care of his daughter! I just feel so bad for the mess she is caught up in and I want to take her away and relieve it all. Obviously I can't do that, but I wish I could just fix things for her and get her out of that house. Has anyone else ever felt so strongly for a poor defenseless child?

My friend lost her baby at week 22 she was born without her lungs developed enough because she was only 22 weeks. My friend has a problem called incompetent cervix I think where the cervix just basically is so thin that if she moves the baby will be born. She was then able to go on and have another baby, but was on bed rest the whole time, and that baby made it but ended up in NICU for 6 weeks.      She was telling me she feels guilty the other day because she had still been smoking a little bit while pregnant with the first baby she lost. Would that have had anything to do with why she lost it? I mean the incompetent cervix is always a problem, not caused by smoking...      I was just hoping there might be info somewhere online showing that that does not cause miscarriage, and maybe put her mind at rest.

My mom is telling me that she won't be able to visit me and my new baby at the hospital after I give birth. You see, she's been having a really hard time walking lately and she says she's quite embarrassed by it. She doesn't think she'll be able to walk the distance from her car to the hospital room to see us. When I told her that the hospital has a shuttle service and will actually pick you up from your car and drive you to the door and then someone will provide a wheelchair to the room, she tells me she doesn't want that. She is embarrassed that she can't do it on her own and will not accept help. I personally am hurt by this. I mean, can't she get over her pride for one day and come see her new grand baby?

20090205081425AAyAtFy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding question?	My son is six months and a week old, lately he seems to be feeding a lot and his sleeping is all over the place. I am shattered, i have been on my own for the last couple of days and both Alfie and i have had horrible colds i am hoping we are getting over the worst of them now. Alfie has only had two half hour naps today he usually has half an hour in the morning and two hours at lunchtime but no half an hour for both today. I just need a few minutes to myself. Sorry that is me moaning....  My question is my boobs feel as though they have gone back to the size pre-pregnancy and feel pretty empty most of the time. Do you think Alfie is having a growth spurt and draining them and my supply will adjust accordingly or is my supply going due to feeling so tired?

20090205075911AAXkd2n	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Spotty period!? 5 days spotting, 2 days flow? do i test?	ok well i hate asking these kind of questions... but i'm interested to see what some of you would say...       i started my period about 4 days late in jan.   it started out very spotty and didn't actually start to "flow" until much later in the day.    it was light and kept stopping and starting.       the second day it stayed pretty consistent in flow but was still light and still dark dark red (brownish-red)      3rd day was the same as the 2nd... still no clotting at all.      4th day spotting.. pretty much stopped... started back up later that night with a BAM (for maybe an hour) than back to spotting.      day 5 (longest for me) spotting brown all day long.      day 6 still spotting much less though.      today day 7 still spotting... pinkish, only noticed it twice so far.      Light Period = only had to use about 4 pads through out cycle.   Flow = having to wear a pad.   Spotting = wearing a liner for "safety" but only ever showed on toilet paper.      tummy still has strange numbing twinges around belly button.   spurts of nausia and dizziness.   random headaches off and on   little bit of cramping - throbbing kind of feeling.         should i go ahead and take a test to be sure? or just assume it was AF and save the test for later?      don't give me any of those "jerk" answers please.    thanks! :)

20090205080424AAVFsJV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	A good schedule for a 4 1/2 month old?	I have been breastfeeding my 4 month old every 3 hours since he came home. (Not because I force him to wait....that was with waking him up to remind him to eat when he was new, he eats on demand-but no longer than 3 hours apart) My doctor said that he should start eating larger amounts less often. I generally feed him around 6:30 AM before I go to work, and I NEED him to eat at 12:30 when he comes to see me on my lunch break. He takes 5 oz of formula at 9:30am and 5 oz of formula at 3:30pm right now, then breastfeeds on demand in the evening. He often doesn't seem hungry when I try to feed him at lunch. Am I just trying to make him eat too often now that he is older? Should we just feed him a smaller amount at 9:30 so he is more hungry at lunch? Could he just have a small amount of rice cereal/veggies/fruit (he just started solids and is READY, his ped. instructed us to start) at the 9:30am feed and no formula, so he may be more hungry at lunch? HELP! Any suggestions for a good schedule for a baby of that age who must eat at 12:30?

20090205092257AAsRC51	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this implantation bleeding, an early/wacked period, or pregnancy? feeling sick everyday, i need some help!?	okay so i'm really very worried because i think i may be pregnant. now before you tell me that i'm not mature enough and that i shouldn't be having sex, please don't. i'm 20 and have been with my boyfriend for 2 years, and we always use protection every time (he wears a condom). i apologize if this is tmi, but you kinda need to know the whole story..      i am worried because my last period was from Jan 14-21. i had sex 4 times, the latest being on the 30th and he says he only orgasmed once or twice but he always pulls out before anyways. about 5 days ago he fingered me fairly hard. since then i have been bleeding lightly, mainly brownish, i haven't seen anything today though. a couple days i started bleeding heavier, it actually being red. i have been feeling sick for the past week, on and off. today i am having bad lower back pain, and also into the thighs. i have been known to have sciatica, and i am sure it is that again. but why would it start all of a sudden? i haven't had it in a few months. my digestive system has been really bad for a week. i will admit i haven't been eating very well at all, usually not much everyday. yesterday night after i got out of the shower, i all of a sudden got really hot and weak and it scared me. i don't know what's going on with my body but it is severely stressing me out.      is this implantation bleeding, an early/short period that got messed up (i live with 3 other girls and one of them is on her period right now), or because of the fingering? i would really appreciate any advice/feedback!! thank you!      by the way, i should have started my next period on Feb 10..i need some help!

20090205075033AAbzjrd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Should I teach my son to pee sitting down or standing up first?	My son is 21 months old and I'm really not trying to potty train him yet as I am about to have another baby any day and didn't want to start something that I wouldn't be able to finish once the baby came. He is 21 months and doesn't seem ready for the potty anyway as he doesn't care if he sits in a wet or soiled diaper. Someone told me to put him in regular underwear and see if he minds that and he peed and could care less that he was wet. So when the time comes I have this little potty with a pee guard on it for boys to sit while they pee. I think that would be easier to do since I imagine he isn't going to understand to pee while standing up and is too small for an adult toilet. He does sit on the potty from time to time, but never does anything so I think that might be best to teach him that way. So has anyone potty trained their son to pee sitting down?

She was smoking outside the class!  Anyway, she is a lovely girl and I asked her had she considered/tried to stop during her pregancy.  She said she had tried and manged to cut down, but never managed to kick the habit totally. She said she was scared that there would no longer be a benefit to her daughter by stopping now, and she seemed totally ashamed and beaten. She thinks any damage has been done.  I have another class with her next Thursday and want to give her some encouragement that she can still make a difference by stopping now, but is this the case?  I'm not sure exactly what risks will be reduced if she does stop now.  Any ladies, both smokers and not smokers have any experience or views to share please?

20090205081326AAWi9uk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Life is too short so you should experience it from birth?	That is my new neighbors motto. They are a couple with 5 kids under age 7 and 2 dogs that all run wild. The children have no set meal times, bed times, aren't required to check in, call, or actually tell them where they are going. As a part of our rules all kids must call home and have permission to go sledding or anywhere else with our family. This one is knocking me for a loop because the parents get upset if we call and don't care where the children are. How can I instill respect and rules in my own and even neighbor kids while 1 child isn't required to follow the rules we have always had in place? I feel bad leaving this little 6 yr old home but I don't want to take him with us if the parent don't know where he is wether they care or not. What would you do?

I wake up feeling great by lunch time I have such a horrible headache I can't concentrate, I feel like I need to go to sleep. I also get this feeling of lightheadedness, it's not quite dizziness, just a lightheaded feeling. I spoke with my doctor's nurse and she told me to take tylenol and lay down whenever this happens. Tylenol really doesn't help and laying down with a three year old and a one year old is next to impossible. Has anyone else had these problems during pregnancy? Did it get better or worse? My headaches seem to be getting worse rather than better. I am 4 months pregnant. Any insight?      I keep hydrated and I eat a snack every 2-4 hours. So it's not dehydration or blood sugar.

Then everything was okay, until Jacob broke up with me and Justin, *my guy friend* cheated on Sydney and broke up with her the same day as me. Well, we were sad together for a while, but her ex, Justin told her that he wanted to be friends still, but ALL Jacob said to me was, "I broke up with you becuase you called me WAY too much!" AND I ONLY CALLED HIM ONCE IN MY LIFE!!! I MEAN GOSH! And then he has the nerve to ask out one of my uglier friends right in front of my face! Happily, she said no, BUT STILL! And know me and Sydney are both boyfriendless, and I don't even know what to do! What should I do now that I'm single??

20090205081651AA5s4Tf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What are pageants like?	Last week, my 6 year old daughter brought home the papers to be in a pageant. She really wants to do it and tomorrow is the last day I can sign her up. ... But what would I be getting us into if I did sign her up?      Honestly speaking, I don't think she is likely to win. So it's not like I would be sentencing us to any of the parades or anything that the winner will have to attend for the next year.       So could somebody give me an idea of what the events up until judging might be like? I'm really not into this girly girl stuff. I know I would need to fix her hair and get her a party dress and something for the sportswear part. But what else is involved? Do they generally give the parents much guidance on what is expected, or do they just assume you know what to do?

20090205074836AAGQsVG	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Embarassing Question..?	So, I have an embarrassing situation.  I have a beautiful 9 month old baby boy who I love very much.  The only problem with my amazing son is this, I have doubts his father is really his biological father. My friends say I am crazy, but here is the reason why. I didn't find out I was pregnant until I was 17 weeks because of the birth control needle, I never got periods anyway.  I was originally due on April 26th, 2008. I had him on May 7th 2008 after being induced because I wouldn't go into labor on my own.  I was originally told I got pregnant in the middle of August.  My boyfriend and I were very on and off that summer and in Early July I slept with my ex boyfriend, and I slept with him again the first week of October. Im wondering, given the dates if there is any chance the other man is the father? Both men know the situation and my ex doesnt think its possible hes the dad, and my current boyfriend believes he is 100% th father because of the dates. He says if the baby was conceived in october and born in may he would have been a very sick preemie, and if he was conceived in early July, our son would have been born in April.. I have my doubts about it, and Im just wondering what anyone else thinks?  Sorry this is so long, just wanted to fit details in.

Then yesterday she tells me she's bleeding from her butt.  We tried to think of many reasons for this, I said she's having stomach ulcers, then we said maybe hemroids.  She's not constipated nor did she say she wiped too hard and oh yea, we did NOT have anal sex.  What could be the problem.  Stress?? i kno my cousin is mad at her for no reason apparently.

All of them boys.  One set of parents, of whom I have been extremely close to for a while, decided to get their son circumcised.  To make a long story short, I don't talk to the father anymore because of his reply when I asked him his reasons.  The idiot actually said that it was "more natural that way", and that it helped prevent infection.  Both excuses I nearly decked him for, the first for obvious reasons, and the second because the foreskin is THERE to prevent dirt and other debris from getting in and causing an infection!      I was just wondering what other people thought about this topic, and why they would or wouldn't have the deed done to their own offspring.  I'm personally of the opinion that it borders on barbaric, but that's just me.

20090205061246AAUMJCN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Help...how long should I wait for her to adjust to new daycare?	Ayva has been going to a daycare home since she was 6 weeks old. I just recently switched her to a daycare center for the preschool activities and more of a learning enviroment. She was sick the Friday before she started the new daycare, so Monday when I dropped her off, she cried! It's so hard to leave them when they are screaming. Mrs. Pam took her from me and I left with my baby crying! I called a little later and they said she had only cried for maybe 30 sec. after I left. Her grandma picks her up Monday's and Wednesdays to spend more time with her until I get out of work. So I didn't get to see how she was when her grandma picked her up, all she said was that it was nap time and so Ayva was sleeping on her little cot. Day 2- I drop her off and she screamed bloody murder, the worst I've seen with her ever. Daycare calls me at 5 and says she's got a fever again of 103. I noticed that morning she had been fussy and clingy, and didn't think anything of it. So I picked her up and she was cuddling with Mrs. Pam on a chair and so I didn't get to see her interact with the other kids. Day 3- she cried again, worse this time. But again, I called and they said she stopped again after 30 seconds after I left. So that brings me today- day 4. She is still crying when I drop her off, it's getting worse. My cousin brings her little girl that too, adn says when she drops her daughter off or picks her up, that Ayva is playing and gives her a big smile, so I know she's happy when I drop her off, but I just want to know how long should I give her for this adjusting period??

20090205082508AAWyvN0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Can you have placenta abruption without any bleeding?	I have a subchronic hematoma, diagnosed at 6w, 4d with an ultra sound due to light spotting (the spotting stopped the same day).  I'm now 9 weeks today and I had a prenatal check up last night.  The doctor tried to hear the heartbeat on his doppler, but couldn't find it, and my breasts aren't as tender as before, so he's worried and is sending me for another ultrasound on Friday to figure out if I'm healed or if the placenta has completely separated (which would mean miscarriage).        I haven't had ANY bleeding, spotting or cramping so I figured I was fine, until last night.  I thought our body got kind of used to the pregnancy hormones and that's why my boobs were less tender (they're still sore enough that I can't lay on my stomach, but mostly sore around the edges now, and I'm still nauseous).  Also, I thought that it wasn't uncommon for the doctor to possibly not be able to find the heartbeat this early (plus his doppler machine looked pretty old).        If I had placenta abruption (the placenta separated from the uterus) wouldn't I have had some bleeding or cramping??        Has any had their doctor not been able to find the heartbeat and had less severe symptoms, only to go on to carry full term??  I'm really nervous, so please don't be mean.  I just want to know if this is normal.
20090205082318AAsnGxr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	After a D & C, is very little pain and cramping a good sign or just normal?	I had to have a D & C 6 days ago because of a missed miscarriage at 10 weeks. The doctors figured it had died before it could have even developed stubs for limbs. I had very little, and extremely light, cramping for a couple of days and have bled very little also, if it wasn't disgusting I could have got away with less than one pad the whole time so far. Also they gave me a prescription for Tylenol 3's, the ones with codeine, for the pain and I haven't even had to take a regular tylenol, I only had a bit of a tummy ache for a couple days. (Which was probably from I the antbiotics they have me on for a week.) I was wondering if this means that everything went just great, and I am doing well and am healthy  "down there." We would love to try for another baby, and since one dr told us to wait 3 months and another told us we could try immediately, we have decided to wait for one period to pass, and then start trying. I know you are not doctors, but am wondering if any one has personal experience with this, and if it sounds familiar to anyone, how their situation ended up going. Thanks a lot ladies!

My son is 3 and his father is deployed.  for the past month he has been getting very upset when his sister leaves for school.  I have just been putting it off that he enjoys playing with her and doesn't want her to go.  Today, we went through the ordeal of throwing ourself to the ground and in front of the door because she had left for school.  i told him he can look out the window and wave bye to her as she walks to the bus stop which we can see from our house.  When the bus came, it started all over again.  after he calmed down a bit i asked him why this was so hard for him and he just said because like usual,.  then he asks me will cydnea come home after school.  i tell him of coarse, why would you think that she wouldn't?  he tells me because daddy doesn't come home anymore.  i try to explain why it is he is not home.  it is not because he doesn't want to be, but because he has to be away. so...my question is, does anyone have an idea on how to make it easier for him when his sister goes to school, so that he will not fear her not to come home again?

20090205082034AA3HTA4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	How much milk should a 32 mo old consume per day?	I am the proud parent of 32 mo old twins. They have been using sippy cups since their first birthday, but have continued to have the bottle of milk at naptime and bedtime and occasionally with breakfast. I have stopped giving them a bottle prior to nap/bed time and they haven't had a problem, but their consumption of milk is practically non existant. They simply refuse to drink milk any other way but from a bottle. I am holding strong with continuing to offer it to them and encouraging them to dink up. I am worried that a child at this age that cuts all milk consumption is in dnager later down the road. Both my children eat diets high in fruits, veggies, & whole grains. They have never had soda or sweets or crappy snacks. The only juice they get is home made from a juicer and then watered down, they love to drink straight ice water. Basically they are healthy children with healthy eating habits.   I am not concerned with hearing from the dummies that think milk should not be a part of a growing toddlers diet, or that a child should only drink skim organic milk, or believe that milk fats dont help coat the neurons in the still developing brain of a toddler (personally i pity their children in the future) I am aware that my children get calcium from their cheese, yogurt, broccoli, fresh spinach and so on, and with the proper iron balance their calcium absorbtion is optimal. But i am still quite concerned  by them turning their nose up to milk all together.  Is this something I should not be concerned with or should I just continue with offering it to them with the hopes they will one day (soon) begin to drink it once again???

20090205082634AA1w9mX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My girlfriend dumped me after my brother played a prank on her (need advice) ?	Last saturday my gf was at my house and we were sat in the living room watching TV, with my younger brother (who is 13) and her best friend. She got up to get something from the kitchen and when she sat back at down, she set off a woopie cushion which my brother had put on her seat when she left the room, then he discreetly spayed "fart spray". My brother is a little immature but he always does pranks like this whenever we have guests over and the guests usually laugh and go along with it. But this was my gf's first time over, and she was very embarrased and angry. I didn't notice him doing it btw but she immediately left the room, went to the bathroom in floods of tears. I tried to comfort her and explain but she didnt want to be anywhere near me. Then she left with her friend. I called her the next day to apologize for my bro's prank but she said she believes I was in on it and that she doesnt want to see me ever again. At first I thought she was just overeacting and would get over it, but she hasn't replied to my calls and texts all week. I'm afraid that I've lost her forever just because of one stupid prank.       How can I prove to her that I wasn't in on it, how to convince her that she's overreacting and has nothing to be embarrased about (in other words she should loosen up a little). Most importantly how do I win her back? SERIOUS answers only please, I've tried asking my friends and my dad for advice but they just laugh at the whole situation.
