AA10214265	I'd suggest the Creation of Disneyland. There's a lot more information out there on that subject.<br>  <br>  From groundbreaking to Opening Day, Disneyland was built in a year. Of course, construction continued (and still continues to this day).<br>  <br>  The pavement on the streets was not yet solidified, and women's high heels sank into the tar.<br>  <br>  A plumbers strike was resolved just before opening and Walt was forced to choose between installing drinking fountains or bathrooms. He chose bathrooms, musing that people could buy soda.<br>  <br>  Walt wisely left many of the landscaping areas incomplete so that he could observe pedestrian traffic patterns and install pathways in the most logical places. Weeds were transplanted and given placards with exotic latin names. There is a story about a colorblind bulldozer operator knocking down trees flagged to be saved, but that has proven to be a myth.<br>  <br>  Disneyland is home to the world's first tubular roller coaster: the Matterhorn.<br>  <br>  Opening day tickets were easily forged, so the park was inundated with guests. One enterprising person put a ladder next to the back fence and charged people to climb over it.|`|XKhNw221aa	Anti-Semitic symbolism incorporated into Disneyland.|`|PCMcxXgbaa	You should do it on the deaths that have happened on rides (if you're kinda mobid like me anyway).

DVn5xxccaa	Well if you really enjoyed Fallout 3 and Oblivion then is it safe to guess you like RPG titles? The final decision really is up to you, but here are a few good online and offline suggestions:<br>  <br>  1.Gears of War 2- In my personal opinion the gameplay and storyline superseded the original by far. You got a better feel for the characters, the story went deeper than it did before, and Horde Mode can provide hours of extra play with your buddies.<br>  <br>  2.Halo Wars-If you like RTS games then this one is perfect (or even if you just love Halo). The battles are intense, the online and offline modes play extremely well allowing you to team up with or take on your friends online or do the same offline with the AI. It also offers a pretty extensive campaign.<br>  <br>  3. FEAR 2- To be honest I'm not sure of FEAR 2's online playability but if you love a good scare this is a great game to sit at home by yourself and play in the dark.<br>  <br>  4.Resident Evil 5- This game actually isn't out yet. It hits shelves Friday March 13 and if you have played the demo then you can tell it's shaping up to be an intense game. Online it's only two player co-op, but that doesn't mean you should count it out.|`|sjunOBG7aa	gears of war 2<br>  mercinarys 2<br>  bio shock<br>  pgr 4<br>  chromehounds<br>  <br>  not sure, just have a look around,<br>  <br>  try even halo wars, <br>  <br>  go to game or gamestation (uk)|`|Npi4QR7Maa	Bioshock<br>  Saints Row 2<br>  Gears of War 2<br>  <br>  that's all i can think of|`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	i see you have saints row but not saints row 2, that's a good game and has online as well, though be wary, if you go online, make sure to save your game first, as loads of people use cheats!<br>  <br>  Halo Wars, good story line and has online as well.<br>  <br>  Gears of War 2, some people don't like it as much as the first, but i love both so there we are.

JcFBmIuIaa	I concentrated mainly on these;<br>  <br>  Small guns - This covers some of the best all round weapons, Shotgun, Assault Rifle, and Hunting Rifle.  Alot of the enemies carry these also so you'll get plenty of ammo.<br>  <br>  Lock Pick - If you get it to at least 75 points it'll cover most locked ammo boxes and doors.<br>  <br>  Big Guns - Missle launcher, Flamer and Minigun are very powerful already, but cranking them up a few notches makes them even more devastating.<br>  <br>  Repair - Weapons are no good to you when they're broken.  It helps to have this skill high up so you can repair weapons in the field instead of having to take them to someone to get fixed.<br>  <br>  I also put quite a few points into Energy Weapons and Medicine, probably around halfway full.<br>  <br>  Of course it depends what way you want to play the game, that's what's so great about it, everyone can choose to develop their character however they wish.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, good gaming.|`|WRnxDB42aa	small guns is a must. most guns fall under that category. energy weapons can be cool but other than a couple rare ones they aren't much better than a small gun. big guns is worth a few points so you can do more dmg with the rocket launcher and fatman<br>  <br>  i focus on: (in order of importance) small guns, repair, explosives, lockpick, science, big guns, energy weapons, and medicine. <br>  <br>  if you want to be adventurous try melee or unarmed. it's tough if you aren't experienced but can make you feel like a real badass.

Npi4QR7Maa	PS3 dude. The Best system out now. I love it because I love the exclusives much more than the 360's exclusives. Plus The Blu-Ray and rechargable batteries for the controller is a great bonus.<br>  <br>  <br>   The 360 is my least favorite because I'm not a huge fan of their exclusives and half the time I cant play the damn thing because its broken.

Online play isn't good<br>  3. Not too many great exclusives<br>  4. Cost lots of $$<br>  <br>  Wii:<br>  PROS:<br>  1. Very fun if you are not alone<br>  2. Great for shooting games (RE4, the upcoming House of the Dead: Overkill)<br>  3. The balance board is fun to use<br>  4. Has an internet browser ($10)<br>  5. Can keep you entertained<br>  <br>  CONS:<br>  1. Horrible graphics<br>  2. Not fun if you are alone<br>  3. Online play is 1/5 in greatness<br>  4. Not for hardcore gamers|`|X6WAOqZOaa	Oh I like the few worded responses like Wii its the best, no explanation.<br>  <br>  For me I prefer the Xbox 360 just because of the games, in ratio compared to the PS3 and the wii combined The 360 wins all around in every game genre.<br>  <br>  Now the PS3 does have some things I like, the controls, free online service (like Xbox live), some games are graphically outstanding (MGS4, Killzone 2, and many more.)<br>  <br>  To me nintendo still seems to be on the kid appropriate side of the game world.|`|iJH4XRwlaa	i would rather go for PS3 than Xbox360... i cannot afford of having RROD even it has been said that RROD is slowly deteriorating... i live in a very hot country so i would go for reliability.<br>  <br>  im not really a halo or gears fan...<br>  ever since, I play PS, and PS2... and some Xbox<br>  so I am more aware of games on PS3 platforms(exclusives) than 360's exclusive...<br>  <br>  360 is a good platform so does the ps3 and the wii<br>  <br>  it is really came down of what you want<br>  <br>  if you want to play online for free, reliability of the console and  not really on the budget and want to spend some money to buy the console with a jam-packed of features go with the PS3<br>  games you would enjoy on the PS3:<br>  <br>  Killzone 2<br>  Resistance 2<br>  Metal Gear Online<br>  Metal Gear Solid 4<br>  Little Big Planet<br>  <br>  if you want to play with others online without caring for the cost because of better experience and good expansion on your games go for the 360...<br>  exclusive games you would enjoy on the 360:<br>  <br>  gears of war 2<br>  halo 3<br>  <br>  if you want to play with your partymates, play old games and on budget go for the Wii and a fan of mario<br>  games you would enjoy on the Wii:<br>  <br>  (I don't really have an idea)<br>  House of the Dead overkill<br>  Super Smash Bros.

If you are going to really spend a lot of time playing games and are are happy to spend the money then the console of choice would appear to be the PS3 (I dont have one myself but I am told they are better on specification than the xbox).  If you are only going to play the odd game here and there then a cheaper, more "fun" console may be for you - the Wii is certainly novel, and good fun, though dont expect ground breaking graphics or the newest most talked about titles.  A PC is probably the best gaming platform out there due to its adaptability, potential power and the huge number of games released on it - though if you are going to get a computer, you would generally use it for other things as well but be prepared to spend a heck of a lot of money on a decent gaming rig.  Another disadvantage with the PC is having to upgrade it every year or so, considering a decent graphics card would set you back (realistically) ￡200+ then you need to be sure you would get the best use out of gaming PC unless of course you have money to burn!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|JJZaOVBdaa	i would say graphics wise, either ps3 or 360, but if you break it down to the better system online wise, 360, buttttt, i would  have to give wii some credit on the whole party experience.

Ps3 games don't have much variants and seem to get boring.<br>  More user friendly, the whole xbox dashboard and marketplace is designed for teenagers, it looks nicer and is easier to comprehend,(i have tried the PS3 thing and it just looks terrible, it is complicated to get what you want...)<br>  Lips is better than singstar (just thought i might say)<br>  Many would say the price. But to buy a PS3 is what... ￡300, with a couple of games, the 360 IS less but if you buy it with the extras it works out about the same (I know as this is about what mine costs) The PS3 comes with most of the accesories built in, so you arnt really getting more for your money, the same applies to the 360.|`|YGHre5zJaa	I personally prefer the X-Box but I like the ps3 very much as well.

GTA4 Expansion)<br>  - Well Designed<br>  - Not too expensive (less the PS3)<br>  <br>  Xbox (Cons)<br>  - Around $300-400 + Online Costs Money<br>  - Requires adapter for wifi<br>  - HD DVD (Lost the battle to Blue-ray)<br>  <br>  PS3 (Pros)<br>  -Jam-packed with features (Blue-ray, extremely fast drive, etc.)<br>  -Sleek Design<br>  -Free Online (reasonable and mostly well done)<br>  -Some Motion Sensor<br>  -Backwards compatable (some models)<br>  <br>  PS3 (Cons)<br>  - Less well-done online system then Xbox<br>  - Costs the most out of all the systems ($400+)<br>  - Lacking still some games because its still a new system<br>  <br>  Well with those, I hope you are able to make your selection.|`|dTuN3FVfaa	xbox 360 by far because if u wnt value for money u got keep in mind that the ps3 costs hundreds more than the xbox does and even may slighty differ its not worth it and even though  the wii has some great nintendo games it will never have the great games like oblivion fallout3 or assasins creed|`|MTxgQgFaaa	okay. it depends wat you like. xbox 360 is for people wo like to challenge people online and show off your achievements online and stuff. 360 isnt worth having if you dont have xbox live. ps3 has lots of features. buy it if you like graphics and stuff like dat DO NOT BUY IT if you want to show off your skills online. buy a wii if you like to move around and have fun. I myself have a xbox360. ive had it for a year now and i am enjoying it very much. If you still can't decide, watch videos on youtube for xbox360 vs ps3 vs wii. You will find that xbox 360 has better graphics, (i know its true.)|`|XV9bp8zpaa	I prefer the Xbox because its not as expensive as the ps3 and not as rubbish as the wii.And no they don't over heat if you look after them like so many people say they do.The people that say that must be so sad if they play on there consoles all day.

826gMnlyaa	dark bribe is best, cause if they use there BEST spell or trap that is limited like lightning vortex, or mirror force. you can negate it and make them draw 1 and what is the chance of them drawing a better card when they just tried to use the best?<br>  <br>  And if you run a zombie or dark deck<br>  Dark illusion is best|`|PsMoCVKRaa	Dark Bribe is more better than solemn...<br>  but when your lp is 500 or something,then solemn is more better than dark bribe...<br>  You can put 1 solemn and 2 dark bribe.|`|2zA27qmCaa	Dark Bribe is a great card for when you have a strong monster on the field and aren't in a bad position for a quick JD or DAD. However, Solemn is fantastic for when your opponent manages to get past your defenses, with a Snipe Hunter or something else that leaves you at a disadvantage. I would side 1 Solemn and maindeck 1 solemn and 2 Bribe, and switch out if your opponent is more summon-oriented.

The Xbox has DLC and they might stop that in the fall. PS3 is for those who want to continue playing the modernized version of the PS2. Xbox can over heat and you can't fix it. PS3 fixed that problem. Xbox doesn't have wireless capabilities. The noise is loud when you turn it on and it might scratch your discs. The PS3's games are a little bit more expensive. If you have 400$ buy a PS3 and rent games. If you have about 450$ you can buy the 360 and get wireless internet. One thing the 360 can do is make Machinima but you need to buy a capture card and an editing software.|`|fvpltc8Laa	GO XBOX360!!!

fub5QVFfaa	The realist has been moved within the folder since WOTLK was released.  This is where it is now (Assuming you are using Windows)<br>  C:\Program Files\World of Warcraft\Data\enUS<br>  Don't ask why it moved, it just has.
fub5QVFfaa	Guilds have their own chat channel within WOW. If they need to tell something that is needed to be told, they can simply Mail a member to tell them so (checking letterboxes fetches these letters, and the game tells you if you have mail). They do not always use skype, since most players don't. It isn't too uncommon to see one guy speaking using skype and is replied to in typing chat, especially at high levels.<br>  As for levels, different guilds take different levels. Typically level 30+ will get a serious consideration by a guild. Once you are in one, just join that one using all your characters, regardless of level. Loyal guildies are often respected better than ones that range where ever they want. Lastly, rare items are controlled (in the bank) by the settings of the guild master. This level of access increases with rank. In a instance, usually the person who needs an item the most will get it over those who don't. Just a warning: Don't go "need" on a item you don't. Many players get kicked from guilds by doing it. Simply: Guilds hate it. There is nothing worse than a mage wanting plate armour or a warrior trying to get a robe.|`|KilOltZNaa	Larger and usuually more raid-oriented guilds will have Ventrilo which is a free program for users.  Someone in the guild will likely have a server, you would just need a headset.  But most casual guilds will rely on guild chat and the ingame voice chat for communications.  Different guilds require different levels before joining.  My recommendation is that you take the time to look around and find the guild that most closely resembles your ingame goals.  <br>  <br>  Raiding guilds will use a loot system(google dkp for an example) that should be explained prior to the raid.|`|fc740c7001eadcc9dc738c63e536abdcaa	check this out my man.. get the full version and join the server called "jaedenar" <br>  <br>  type /who Azeroth's most wanted<br>  <br>  ideally look for a 72 gnome warrior and say your on yahoo answers<br>  <br>  if im not on, ask anyone to invite you to the guild and say you know "thepags"<br>  <br>  im the #2 in that guild, its perfect for people lookin to level and have fun, and once we get enough ppl at the right level well be raiding like crazy and then ill explain how the looting thing will work for our guild (prolly a need over greed thing (if you need it youll get it)). you can be lvl1 when you join a guild btw. we just talk over the /g channel.. maybe later (when we raid) well get a vent channel that will let us talk using headphones and junk, but prolly not for a while.<br>  <br>  trust me you wont go wrong with my guild, ill take care of you my man.|`|DtkLsetkaa	It entirely depends on the guild.  Think of it like a fraternity.  There are lots of different ones for lots of different reasons, some raid, some are "family" atmosphere, some are PvP, it all depends what you want to get out of the game what kind of guild you are going to go for.  The higher end raid guilds will require you to have top gear and to prove yourself as a good raider, and also usually to have a good attitude and to be an adult (my raid guild required 18+, and I would never have gone to a guild that didn't).  Level doesn't matter, if you find a guild you like and get along with you should think about joining.  Talk to a member and see if its what you are looking for.  Members usually communicate via a website/forums.  In game, most use Ventrillo/TeamSpeak.  When it comes to gear, most higher end raid guilds use a DKP system, and until you have been there a while, you won't have the DKP to use to get gear, so if gear is your only objective, you might have a tough time, you have to pay your dues if you want to be in a successful guild.   If you have any other questions feel free to email me, or edit your post.  Good luck!!!|`|MnVcx0HDaa	Ventrilo is the most common voice chat program

MTPa5Bxwaa	1. 26<br>  2. Analytical Lab Tech<br>  3. Gaming is my hobby. Played a lot as a child, stopped during teens, picked it back up when the 360 was released. Interested in mostly shooters but some sports, racing & RPGs. I buy whenever a game I like comes out. Where I buy all depends and normally it's just the regular edition of games for the Xbox 360.<br>  4. Variety of gaming sites, mostly IGN & Gamespot<br>  5. None<br>  6. Not really. All the 360 games are $60 unless it's a limited edition but I rarely get those.<br>  7. I am familar with Gamestop and I do shop there on occasion. I mostly go there to purchase used games that I'm not sure I want to pay full price for.<br>  8. I don't have a problem with an open box game, same as used game to me. I've never bought a game that I knew had already been opened though.<br>  9. I treat my games likes babies, $60 is too much to throw away in my eyes. If the games in good condition, go for it!<br>  10. I only pre-order if it's a really big title and/or a game I really like and want on the first day.<br>  11. Box art is okay but not a big deal with me.<br>  12. I would suggest giving more store credit for trade-ins or lowering the price on used games. Sometimes it feels like an unfair trade, especially if you see how much the game is sold for after you trade it in.<br>  13. See #12.|`|2fqXT9W6aa	1. 13<br>  2. School...<br>  3. Yeah. Yeah.

At Gamestop the pre-owned games are always shown clearly that they are pre-owned.<br>  9. Yeah, I like to keep my games in good condition. I don't usually sell my games after I'm done with them.<br>  10. No, I don't really pre-order games much. I usually wait untill a bit after the game comes out when they are more available and cheaper.<br>  11. Not much, as long as the box doesn't look TOO terrible.

Nope|`|Kqpqt69Vaa	i am a 48 yr old gamer who pours and finishes concrete floors ,driveways and walks for a living,so i bust my butt for my money.i love gaming and think it is a great hobby.i enjoy most video games,no sports just not my bag.i usually buy my games at game stop or if i need controllers or what ever its usually there.i get my info off of the internet and out of gaming mags.if i need software there's not much to consider,if you need it you buy it.some times price may affect my decision but not always,if i want it i buy it,most times.yes i am familiar with gamestop and shop there quite often.they are fairly close to where i live,but the one i go to in raynham ma the employees are helpful and if i ask questions there usually pretty good with answers.yes i have bought open boxes before and was told it was open.i don't see anything wrong with buying it opened as long as it is complete and there games are always marked used if so.i keep my games in the best shape possible.yes i will buy opened if it is all there.i have pre ordered games before if it is some thing that i really want,like a gta game.the art isn't what im playing,if its cool looking then great if not then its not.i have no complaints about gamestop i think they do a great job. i hope this helps you out.|`|rMsbcQsZaa	I don't have a ton of time so i cant answer all of them...<br>  3) ive been gaming for about 6 years now. Its a major hobby of mine. Im into sports and shooter games. I buy at gamestop.<br>  6) price is somewhat important when buying but i mainly just buy it if it is good enough and i have researched a little about it.<br>  7) i only shop at gamestop. the employees are so helpful and kind.<br>  9)I treat my games with full respect. i want them to last as long as possible<br>  10) i only preorder a game if it is much anticipated and i strongly believe i will enjoy it<br>  11) i judge games at first sight by their box art. if it looks interesting, then i will pick it up and read the back<br>  12 and 13)Gamestop is perfect the way it is. Maybe make the stores slightly bigger so more people can fit in them. also more employees would be nice because lines can get very long.|`|DtkLsetkaa	1. How old are you?  29<br>  <br>  2. Occupation?  Fraud Investigator for a Bank, and a bartender on the weekends<br>  <br>  3. Do you have an interest in gaming? Is this your Hobby? How long have you been gaming for? What types of games are you interested in? How often do you buy game software? Where and what do you buy?  I buy at least 1 game per month, used if I can get it, and usually from Game stop.  I get quite a few from Best Buy too because I get 5-10 dollar off coupons.  Its one of my hobbies, and I do have an interest.  I have been gaming for 25 years or so, since intellivision and atari were invented :)<br>  <br>  4. In general, where did you get game software information? Internet sites, G4 tv mainly.<br>  <br>  5. When you buy game software, what factors do you consider?  Play time I am going to get out of it, online capabilities, if my friends will be playing it as well, if its my "style" of game.<br>  <br>  6. Is price important when buying a video game? Why or why not?  Not really, I expect to pay 60 for anything new and 50 or less for anything used for Xbox, and varying prices for DS games and computer games.  I don't worry about the price very much.<br>  <br>  7. Are you familiar with Gamestop? Do you shop at Gamestop? If so, why Gamestop is your video game of choice over other stores? If not, why?  My Game Stop has a great staff  (and a hot manager) and always help me with whatever I need.  I also like the wide variety of used games and the trade in values.<br>  <br>  8. Would you buy an open box copy of a game? Have you ever been notified when buying a game that has already been opened by a Gamestop employee? How do you feel about that? Do you wonder if the game has been previously played?   I don't worry about it because I know that if I have a problem I will be allowed to get a new one.  Makes no difference to me.<br>  <br>  9. Do you keep your games/possessions in good shape? Do you agree with buying a new game that has been opened?  My games are in excellent shape and I take very good care of them. I have no problem with oppened games.<br>  <br>  10. Do you take advantage of the option to per-order games? Why or why not?  Sometimes I do, but usually only if my friends are.  I am pretty patient and can wait a week or two if I dont get the chance to pick it up right away. <br>  <br>  11. Is box Art important to you? if so why  Not really.  I research a game before I buy it so what the box looks like is unimportant to me.<br>  <br>  12. If you could change one thing about GameStop what would it be?  No idea.  <br>  <br>  13. Any suggestion or comments?  Not really, thanks :)|`|RnhAWXHzaa	1. 16<br>  <br>  2. Jobless, but i attend high school<br>  <br>  3. Of couse, yes it is my hobby. I have been gaming since i was 4 years old, played contra all the time. I like FPS, RTS, RPG, adventure games are nice too, but shooters in general are my favorite. I buy game software very often.<br>  <br>  4. Gameinformer, friends, etc.<br>  <br>  5. Performance and reviews.<br>  <br>  6. depends, im not buying a crappy game for 60$ for my 360.<br>  <br>  7. Yes, yes, and because it's the closest and has alot more of a selection of games to buy than target or walmart.<br>  <br>  8. yes, yes, uncaring and also uncaring.<br>  <br>  9. relatively yes, and yes.<br>  <br>  10. yes, sometimes if i really want it because most of the time you get some exclusive content if you pre-order so why not.<br>  <br>  11. nope, look at halo 3 or Earth defense force 2017. They're not very good or creative box art but they are good games and thats all that matters.<br>  <br>  12. maybe host some tourneys every once in a while and have prizes and stuff.<br>  <br>  13.

It's well known that some of the old Grandmasters Masters didn't like the Sicilian Defense a 100+ years ago if your opponent played 1.e4 you were expected to respond with e5 any other response was considered cowardly.|`|464cd149b8bc7f1afebea410c89ca583aa	The Sicilian defense in chess is a response to the move 1.e4 (Pawn to King 4). The defense is characterized by the opening move 1...c5 (P-QB4). This opening is a very aggressive one  for the player of the black pieces, and provides the player with opportunities to sacrifice material to gain an advantage. By  playing 1.e4 c5, in many lines Black gains a half-open c-file for counterplay. The problem with this opening is that in many lines black falls behind in development as he or she makes lots of pawn moves in the opening. However, if you like open games and  games that are of a tactical nature then the Sicilian Defense should be your choice of defense when your opponent begins the game with 1.e4 (Pawn to king four). Many of the most  successful chess players in the history of chess have played the Sicilian defense:Kasparov,Fischer,Tal.|`|z8xYANiJaa	The Sicilian defence 1...c5 is the most common response to 1. e4.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_Defence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_De...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_defence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilian_de...</a>|`|YMHsibG8aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5KFk1RtGvA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5KFk1RtG...</a>|`|5voFMvonaa	white moves p to e4,black replies p c5

kIqq7yIAaa	best recommendation is to buy 2-3 sets in different colors<br>  most gamers have more than 1 set for a reason<br>  mostly for making multiple rolls on an attack turn<br>  <br>  yes some people will yell, curse, toss, throw, smash, or melt their dice<br>  when it doesn't roll what they wanted or they lose their favorite character<br>  <br>  I have seen the pewter ones and had a deluxe set made for me<br>  but that set was stolen along with all my other dice so I have to replace them<br>  they can be found at some hobby shops or even at your local Ren. Faire as I did|`|Vv7a31pmaa	double d.|`|djNeNEOuaa	You will need a d4, d6, d8, d12, d20, and 2 d10's (so that you can roll percentiles.) You can find sets of dice in nearly any gaming shop or you can by them by the pound off of different websites. Buying by the pound would be the best option if you plan to DM. Alternatively you could download a random dice generater, though I personally prefer actual dice.|`|uoCq9B7yaa	Some shops sell them by sets.  These are nice cause you can get whatever color or style suits you or your character.  (Nice also for when others forget theirs!)|`|Qi9qrikhaa	get red ones they're pretty x]|`|GZ9LjS13aa	a six sided one duh|`|8b7170e38a50a75423054d4df0120b1caa	I suggest several different sets of dice, some times you have to role multiple times and have to differentiate the roles.  Choose something that you would like.<br>  <br>  BTW Some gamers talk to the dice, some gamers burn their dice, some gamers hurl their dice when they get a bad role, some players even spend hours and hours rolling dice to try to pick ones that role "better" than normal. Some gamers keep a primary dice and when it is not preforming they yell at the dice and threaten it that they will replace or worse melted.  Don't want to scare you, these people are a scarcity.   But after 20+ years gaming you have a good laugh or two.|`|HDK9MhONaa	At one point there was a company that made a pewter set of dice, good and heavy...|`|bKo79vnBaa	Here's some advice... don't play D&D.
pAqfWJ8Haa	we don't want to se a story like that in the paper....there would be a lot of walk in traffic....we make more money winning all the lotteries than we do working our trade...we see the future and know when the times or the tribune is going to run a story front page above the fold....we then feed the newspapers an even better story and take ours off the front page....once or twice a story was front page below the fold but that is simply yesterdays news.....idiots like you keep buying tickets and when it gets above a hundred million we pick the winning ticket and divide the cash......here is an interesting statistic.....every winning ticket above 73.28 million has never been a random computer picked nnumbers...every single one a person hand picked the numbers ...check it out......|`|lxWYPNpYaa	Because "psychics" are thieving liars who cannot see into the future.

ZiMkydtHaa	yes it called the dsi and it does have a camera <br>  spec`s<br>  2 bigger screens.<br>  <br>  2 integrated cameras.<br>  <br>  Improved audio quality and volume. <br>  <br>  Built in SD slot allowing full music playback. <br>  <br>  Built in web browser.<br>  <br>  Downloadable software. <br>  <br>  And yet 12% slimmer than the Nintendo DS Lite!|`|BiMeb75Gaa	Yes it's called the Nintendo DSi and it is coming out on the 3rd of April in the UK and the 5th of April in the USA. It has TWO cameras with 12 different lenses like Graffiti, Colour, Frames ect. It also has a build in SD card slot for listening to music. While you are listening to the music you can add rock, pop and hip hop effects. You can also search the internet and go onto the DSi shop and purchase DSi ware to make your DS totally yours. It has all this and it is 12% thinner! Unfortunately the gameboy advance slot has been removed but it is still the coolest thing EVER!|`|ZMcPHP7Yaa	Yeah, the Nintendo DSi. It's going to have a bunch of new features, but the problem is is that there's no GBA port, which means all your Advance games are as good as gone. The"concept" looks nice, but I don't think it's going to be all that popular, especially with the lack of the GBA port.<br>  <br>  It's also going to have a DSi Shop, not unlike the one on the Wii where you can purchase games. However, the games and applications are 'region specific", meaning if you like import games, you'll only be able to play them in the region you DLed them in. No joke.<br>  <br>  Also heard that the battery life is much lower then the DS Lite as well.|`|nFg5iqOLaa	HELL YEA ITS THE SAME AS PSP BUT YOU CAN TOUCH SCREEN IT ALSO BU JUST A COPY OF A PSP AN YS IT DOES ACTUALLY HAVE A CAMERA!!!!|`|1LqMbG7saa	yeah nintendo just announced the revoultion<br>  portable mobile device that can play anything from any time period even xbox!<br>  waste more time to ask the question instead of looking it up|`|Z3OLmuQFaa	yes there is a new DS coming out. Im not sure about the thing about being the same as the psp but yes i've heard it has a camera. >^^<

6GIrW5eWaa	Most games  you can download now, the only one that I have heard to date that you don't want to do it Halo 3. This will still require you to keep the disk and install it when you want to play but this is just a validation of ownership really. Once you start the game it plays from the HDD and not the disk. Good Luck<br>  <br>  Nico please quit putting out incorrect information. You have to have the disk even though you have installed it on the hard drive.|`|W4c5Swk9aa	If you put the disk in first. You can then download it onto your harddrive and play it, get achievements, and go on LIVE. So yes that means you can play it  without the disk in it after that.|`|AA10599108	what you are doing by downloading it to your hard drive is making it when you play it that the disk doesn't spin causing your xbox to run cooler and quieter and for single player modes the load times are shorter you still need to have the disk in the tray to play the game though you can do it with any xbox 360 game but they say not to do it with halo 3|`|cUR7JyDFaa	yes, but it takes up a lot of space on it. If you think your game is probably going to get scratched, then download it. You can also download the game, and trade the game into Gamestop for money. Since you downloaded the game, free money :)|`|ajD2zlM9aa	yes, you will be able to play it whenever, even without the disk, the only problem is that it takes up quite a few gigs. unless you have the elite console i don't recommend that you do this.|`|iW0qemXXaa	yes it takes up alot of space and you still need the disc to play|`|E9Vr6ze2aa	Yes but it takes up memory

Ndfk6f8taa	OH MY GOSH! I love this question! There are sooo many things to do! Even though I am only 12, I have held and organized many parties. There are a lot of website to visit such as:<br>  <br>  1. <a href="http://www.bluepineapple.com/partygames/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluepineapple.com/partygames/</a><br>  2. <a href="http://www.partydirectory.com/games/" rel="nofollow">http://www.partydirectory.com/games/</a><br>  3. <a href="http://www.partygamecentral.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.partygamecentral.com/</a><br>  4. <a href="http://www.party411.com/gameguide.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.party411.com/gameguide.html</a><br>  5. <a href="http://www.partygameideas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.partygameideas.com/</a><br>  6. <a href="http://www.teenpartyideas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenpartyideas.com/</a><br>  <br>  A few of my favourite party games are:<br>  <br>  1. Truth or Dare (A typical classic game!)<br>  <br>  2. Pigs in a Blanket - Everyone hides under the same blanket and one person is it. 'It' tries to tell who everyone is by feeling out their features.<br>  <br>  3. Who is Where? - Find a room that can be totally dark. Again, one person is it. 'It' hides outside - as everyone hides somewhere in the room - and is called back in when everyone is hidden. 'It' tried to find everyone. This game is played best in a large, pitch dark room.<br>  <br>  4. Scream - A fun outdoor game. Teams of two are chosen and one team, again, is it. One team waits inside and the other team(s) hide somewhere on the street. The 'it' team waits for a pre-decided amount of time and then goes outside to look. The teams that are outside have to wait until the 'it' team is outside and within a few metres. If any team spots the 'it' team or the 'it' team spots any other team, the then must scream as loud as possible.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a wonderful fourteenth birthday and... HAPPY EARLY BIRTHDAY!! So I hope you have fun and use some of my games!<br>  <br>   Hope this helps!<br>  <br>               Taylor!|`|wVYIBPVraa	definatly truth or dare, xtreme style<br>  murder in the dark... not that great<br>  but wats really fun, go 2 some random persons house, and dont tp them, but rearrange all their outdoor furniture in the middle of the night<br>  then just run around ur stree and other streets around u in the evening and act all weird and do stuff like ring a doorbell then tell them theyve won a pony u got from ur ceiling... hold up a rool of toilet paper...<br>  <br>  ive had so much fun doing this kinda stuff

aQTlygsCaa	Have you ever flown planes before? If you haven't, I wouldnt suggest this project. If you have, I would suggest using a regular toy foam plane and converting that into an RC. Wood seems pretty darn heavy to make an RC Airliner... <br>  Also, no, they dont give out free plans. You could buy an Airliner from E-Fliterc.com. <br>  The one on there should be much cheaper than if you were to build one yourself.
WuhIoS1laa	You might want to check if you have conflicting objects or hacks that snuck in with these houses.  I'm not sure where you got them from, but not all sites are good about making sure that creators weren't sloppy when they uploaded their creations. <br>  <br>  Also, did you delete any files from the download directories since the houses worked?  You might want to use a tool that will check for conflicts and orphaned content files. <br>  <br>  The Clean Installer is a nice tool for installing to avoid this.

Means there too much stuff in the house for your graphics card to display right.  Sims2 is a space hog and can use up everything if your computer is made to run games like it.<br>  But scanning stuff is a great idea, like someone else said.<br>  There is a free downloadable software called Clean Installer.  I love this program, because it lets you see what is in a download like your lots....BEFORE you put them in your game!  It highlights hacks in red and duplicates in pink and if there are things you don't want added to your game you can take them out before installing them.  For instance, I love to "breed" aliens in the game, but people make fake green skins.  I use Clean Installer and see if a lot with aliens have a green skin in it, if so, I do not install it.<br>  You can download it here...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/" rel="nofollow">http://sims2pack.modthesims2.com/</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Have a wonderful Sim life!|`|0R0QngRmaa	try to scan it with an anti-virus!!

There's usually at least one Entei up during the night hours. Alot of the time they ask for either a Raikou or Lugia, pretty simple to find.<br>  <br>  It's alot easier to do chain-trading on GTS. It's where you see something you want, but they want something you don't have, so then you lookup what they want, and then you see if you have what the other person wants for what the first one wants, etc.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  I see an Entei for trade, they want a Raikou.<br>  I don't have a Raikou in my PC, so I go and look for a Raikou on GTS.<br>  I see a Raikou that someone wants a Lugia for.<br>  I have a Lugia in my box, and I trade them a Lugia for their Raikou.<br>  Then I trade that Raikou for the Entei.<br>  I have an Entei, yay!<br>  <br>  It's alot quicker than it sounds, and it's all done in less than 60 seconds.<br>  <br>  I've managed to accumulate loads of shiny Pokemon from this method.

Xm5ab6F6aa	Bratz Dolls Get a Reprieve<br>  <br>  The Bratz Dolls have gotten a reprieve of sorts. In the seemingly never-ending lawsuit between Mattel and MGA Entertainment over the dolls, a judge has ruled that MGA can sell the Bratz dolls through the end of 2009, even though they infringe on Mattel's copyright. <br>  U.S. District Judge Stephen Larson "indicated he will be modifying his Dec. 3 stay ... to allow purchases and sales (of Bratz items)" beyond a previously set deadline of Feb. 11, MGA attorney Tom Nolan said. MGA had asked Larson to postpone his order barring the company from selling products that infringe on Mattel's (MAT.N) copyrights until MGA can appeal the ruling to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. A Mattel representative had no immediate comment. <br>  <br>  MGA told the court retailers were skittish about placing orders for spring and fall of 2009 because of uncertainty about whether the toys would be available, Nolan said. MGA has invested "tens of millions of dollars" developing spring and fall Bratz lines and is awaiting orders from retailers in January, Nolan said. <br>  <br>  "Retailers wanted assurances that if they buy them they can sell them," he said. It was not immediately clear whether MGA would keep profits from those sales or if they would be placed in an escrow account until the appeals process is completed. <br>  Our guess is that the money from the sales will be placed into an escrow account pending a determination as to how much is profit. Presumably, the profits will go to Mattel because it owns the rights to the dolls now. <br>  <br>  Photo: Bratz doll: Pretty Pirate Yasmin <br>  Hope this helps|`|UNBzZ3x3aa	Probably just old stock that they technically shouldn't be selling.......|`|oAOWx47Taa	the barbie company complained that Bratz are too much like the barbies. They tried to compete with the MyScene dolls, but they just couldn't beat bratz. Barbie company took Bratz company to court and sadly won. Bratz have to be taken off shelves and they will become antiques. But I think the barbie company are rethinking there choice. they might try to share profits w/ Bratz

mwYFYXXmaa	i just did this on my pokemon gold on my laptop lmao, here this what i used<br>  <br>  Starting from the hard bit of ice path<br>  <br>  First, go up, then left, down, left, up, right, up, and right. This will<br>  place you in the upper-right corner. From there, go down, left, up, left,<br>  down, right, down, right, up, and right to escape. To the right is another<br>  path, one you have to negotiate to beat this game. Starting at the higher<br>  point, go right, up, left, down, right, up, and right to get HM 07. This<br>  is Waterfall, which is needed to win the game. From the HM, go left, down<br>  and left to get out and go up the ladder.<br>  <br>  <br>  When up the ladder, go right and down to appear in a boulder-and-hole room.<br>  Push the boulders into the holes and go down the ladder. (It shouldn't be <br>  that hard.) You'll appear in a giant ice sheet with items around it. From the<br>  ladder, go left, down, left, up, and right to get to the next ladder. When<br>  you come up, go around the rocks and get the Nevermelt Ice, which increases<br>  the power of Ice moves. Double back to a ladder, and you'll turn up in a room<br>  with a Z-shaped platform. Go to the stairs and jump down, then go over to get<br>  TM 44 (Rest). Then, slide up, left, and down to the final ladder. Get the PP<br>  Up on the way out. You'll end up in Blackthorne City.

jA6OZjIGaa	actually if you are breeding a pokemon (which in your case, a Banette) and a Ditto, you will usually get "they don't seem to get along" from the Day-Care man, but that's ok, as long as the pokemon you put in the Day-Care besides the Ditto is breed-able (an example that is not breed-able, a Dialga).<br>  <br>  If you are able to get another Banette with opposite gender, then no doubt they will make a Shuppet.<br>  <br>  But if you aren't able to do that, then choose a male pokemon that belongs to egg group "Amorphous", you should be to breed a Shuppet, since the baby would be whatever the female is or its pre-evolution<br>  <br>  If you are still unable to get one, give me a email with your name and the friend code in it, I'll try to get you one<br>  <br>  email: rayszeto94@yahoo.com

If you're doing things like low level alchemy and enchant spells then you could have 25 magic with 10 hp still because alchemy and enchants don't give HP experience.

Since it takes like a month or so to repair the 360, they give you a refurbished one & then yours will be repaired & given to someone else.  This way, it only takes a week to get yours back.  Go to <a href="http://www.xbox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com</a> and submit the repair online, it's a lot easier than talking to the Xbox reps that are in India.  Sorry that it happened, I totally feel your pain :-(<br>  <br>  Edit: That really sucks, I haven't heard of that happening, I was able to register mine online w/o any problems.

After about 5 weeks they sent it back repaired...<br>  <br>  However, I live in Australia, so the service might be a little different.. In that case, I still recommend calling the Xbox Customer Support.|`|Cau6usq0aa	Yes you should send it back if you have a 3 year warranty, and your second question about them sending you back a new one - yes they probably did they probably did, they didn't want you to leave them for PS3 or something if it breaks 3 times I think they send you an XBOX Elite if you don't have one already.|`|z66lvlP3aa	when they say it is brand new, they mean it is new compared to your old one lol, they always give you a refurbed one

Immediately upon logging in, put on your Protect Item prayer just in case, as well as Protect from Magic, and run as quickly to a safe area as possible before you are attacked by another Revenant.<br>  <br>  Some safe spots you can look for are: Clan Wars, Bounty Hunter lobby, Stealing Creation, the Mage Bank (inside of course), and obviously outside the wilderness. Best of luck.|`|GUrBfgQGaa	Log on and run. Thats how simple it is. Just log on and run far away from the ghost. After you ran away, put the rapid heal on and just stay safe for a minute or two.

xDubataIaa	Get the Sonic Genesis Collection. It's an incredible value, and it's not just about the Sonic games themselves but other classics as well. There are many different types of games included in the collection so you will never get bored.<br>  <br>  Far Cry 2 was a fine game, the island was huge, detailed and immersive.  It had tons of missions and different ways to complete said missions but it just got old after a while. Like I said, the island is huge, but that is also its biggest problem: there are too many long stretches where you are either driving a POS vehicle or walking on foot to your next objective. There are much better shooters out there to be played.|`|4e11GJVZaa	I disagree that farcry 2 is a bad game, but I do agree that most Sonic games are very similar. I think that Far Cry 2 will definitely give you more game time and a more enjoyable experience.|`|0fyhULmPaa	I already answered in your future question that sonics collection is awesome, and if you buy it from me on ebay and give me an extra 5 dollars ill come play it with you, no matter where you live, although you will have to provide my sleeping accommodations (preferably in the same bed) and i require 3 meals a day from restaurants of my choice ill shoot you a pm with the link|`|iO4WLTTqaa	Both were kind of bad games/ collection of games, but i would say Farcry 2. Just because sonic games are all alike, if you've played one you've played them all.

I would also check to see what he has been selling.  If all he has been selling are cheap junk, then I wouldn't trust him.  If he's been selling expensive stuff and got good feedback, then he's reliable.<br>  <br>  If he says it's brand new, I think he's obligated to sell it brand new.  Read carefully to make sure that he says it's brand new, and not almost new.  If you're not sure, ask him.|`|9rEOY77raa	you can trust ebay. if you don't get it, they'll give you a refund|`|4zWSp7kvaa	Ebay is a great site, on which I have brought various items from. The items were in the condition the seller claimed it would be in.<br>  <br>  For the delivery, most items have a certain shipping price. You will need to pay it in order for it to be shipped to you. If the seller lives nearby, you could meet up and do the trade face to face; which will give the opportunity to try out the system.<br>  <br>  I think you should trust the seller. Check the sellers past sales, and check their feedback as well. If their feedback and comments are mostly positive trust them. :) I hope this helps|`|MGU4jA7Qaa	<a href="http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories/fun/imagedump/demotivational_posters/ebay.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.marcofolio.net/images/stories...</a>

Charizard also learns good moves in the johto reigon typhlosion because it is fast and has good sp attac kand attack. learns some awesome moves like eruption very powerful. In the hohen swampet wins hand down it has good defense and sp defense awesome hp and really good attack plus it learns some great moves. Swampet is the best starter of all of them. Infernape is a great starter too because of its good sp attack attack and speed plus it learns so many awesome moves and can be a mixed sweeper and with max speed of 346 can outspeed quite a few pokes. but swampert is the best teach charizard: eartthquake, flamethrower,dragon pulse and fly. Teach typhlosion eruption, earthquake, flamethrower and stealth rock. Teach swampert:waterfall,earthquake avalanche and stealth rock and infernape can learn so many moves but i prefer a physical inferenape with fire punch thunder punch, close combat and earthquake there hope i helped good luck with your team need anymore advice abotu pokemon email me at  jacksongreen333@hotmail.com kk bye good luck.|`|iuO9p67xaa	charmander<br>  totodile<br>  turwig<br>  <br>  charmander is easily the best of the 9 as charizard was definaly the coolest when red came out<br>  totodile has the best evolutuion stages in silver and gold <br>  turwig abit of an underdog but how much strenght doest its flly eveolved form have basically a grass version of blastoise|`|pdaQNYZnaa	i am going mainly by the variety of attacks they can learn<br>  <br>  my favs out of each gen are:<br>  <br>  1.

Chimchar or Piplup|`|1o6S58uCaa	Charizard,Empoleon,Sceptile<br>  hands down<br>  :D|`|FKO9MKVMaa	First is definately charizard because it can be a physical sweeper and a great type match-up<br>  <br>  then Felaligator because of its special attack and ablity to learn dark moves<br>  <br>  then sceptile because it learns grewat moves in the end and will do well in the elite four<br>  <br>  then infernape ismply because in the game you have a choice of that of rapidash, and infernape wins hands down|`|Y1ZfC8M2aa	Personally I would say Sceptile because it's my favorite.

D5cOFZdwaa	darling it is so NOT a waste. I traded in my xbox 360 in for a wii and my whole family LOVES it. and besides if you do decide that it was a waste for you to get rid of your ds its not like you can't go back to gamestop and trade your wii in and get the ds back. but trust me you wont regret the trade|`|ph9xJ221aa	There are  numerous cheats for this game|`|q7v1XAHAaa	When you are alone it's kind of boring but it is kick *** when you play with friends|`|0NYQNr9saa	They are really fun, much better than a Ds|`|mz7N5W9baa	Well first, what kind of DS do you have? If you really like the DS, there is a new one coming out soon called the DSi.<br>  It's kinda like the Nintendo Wii because of the internet shop channel and such. There is a Camera on it, you can buy games off the internet (with the special points card), and you can mix and match a lot of music. It's pretty fun!<br>  But for the Nintendo Wii... I don't see the reason why your mom would think of it as bad, it's about the best consule out there! And if you want to sooth your parents into getting it, tell them about all the educational games for Wii. All the workout games for you and your parents. I got the WiiFit for myself because of the balence board and the good ratings, and my mom and dad are using it to stay in shape! There are a lot of possibilities for the Wii consule and so many games to buy!<br>  This is a really great consule for, litteraly, people of all ages.<br>  <br>  Check it out!~~~ <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/wii/" rel="nofollow">http://www.nintendo.com/wii/</a><br>  ~~~<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/19/wii-faq-answers-to-your-wii-questions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engadget.com/2006/11/19/wii-f...</a>|`|8k0HDdTWaa	Yes i think the Wii is a fun system and Here are my opinions of the pros and cons of the Wii system<br>  <br>  pros : can download nes snes sega n64 and some other game systems games (for less than $20 each some as little as $5) , can play gamecube games, can easily connect to internet, easy for everyone to use, gets you up and moving, helps with balance and hand eye coordination.<br>  <br>  cons : the Wii games are expensive, takes up a lot of room, the wiimote is a little touchy, mine has a tendency to overheat (got mine 2 weeks after they were released though), since the wiimote isn't very accurate it can get very repetitive and frustrating to work with.<br>  <br>  Those are the main things I can think of right now hope this helps.|`|TLsVX0baaa	In my opinion it is fun. It is fun making the Mii's. Wiisports is a fun game for the Wii. I would rather have a Wii the a Nintendo DS.|`|NenSY2msaa	It depends on your age.

sgxGglK4aa	The earliest playing cards were believed to be originated in Central Asia.  Documented history of playing cards start sometime in the 10th century.  The Chinese began using paper like dominoes that could be shuffled and dealt for games.  Europe imported the cards in the 13th or 14th century.  The 4 suits started by French design and from there they went world wide.

wAiVxAKNaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Yes, "Skyrim" is a current Bethesda trademark. It is unsure if that name is related to The Elder Scrolls V, howevever.<br>  <br>  From Wikipedia:<br>  "In late 2008, it was announced that the Elder Scrolls V could possibly be released in 2010.<br>  <br>  Zenimax trademarked the name "Skyrim", but it is uncertain if it actually relates to the fifth installment of the Elder Scrolls."
lQGDV7MEaa	You're probably not leveling up the skills you need to level up.<br>  Remember in the beginning when you chose 7 or so skills? Those are your major skills, which you need to raise in order to level up. Once you get an accumulative of 10 of them, you can level up.
M9FQSKRwaa	the best way to know how many stitches to cast on so that the blanket come out to the size that you want would be to make a gauge swatch.  This video will show you what to do, make the swatch using the stitch that you will work the blanket in.  A tip for a beginner as yourself, using bulky or superbulky yarn will not only make the blanket nice and warm but it will also give you less stitches to cast on and less rows you need to work.  Plus this will make the blanket be done in no time at all, id say about a month tops.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtjMv-BAnQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKtjMv-BA...</a><br>  <br>  once you figure out how many stitches you have per inch, this is what you do to figure out how many stitches you need.<br>  <br>  1.) first figure out how wide you want the blanket, lets say for example you want the blanket 48 inches wide.  keep in mind that the measurement should stay in inches.<br>  <br>  2.) now you take your gauge, lets say its 2 stitches per inch.<br>  take 2(stitches per inch) times 48(how wide you want the blanket to be) equals 96.  so you cast on 96 stitches.<br>  <br>  3.) next you need to determine how long you want the blanket to be.<br>  <br>  4.) now to determine how many rows to work so that the blanket will be as long as you want.  lets say that you want the blanket to be 5 feet long, this would be 60 inches.  Lets say that you have 3 rows per inch.  you take 3(rows per inch) times 60(how many inches long you want the blanket) equals 180.  so you work 180 rows and then simply bind off your stitches and weave in your ends.<br>  <br>  Presto! you just made your own Knit pattern for a blanket.|`|154dzJ1Faa	A throw blanket will take a couple years, perhaps, to finish.  Make a square first.  You need to know how many stitches you get to the inch first.<br>  <br>  Then do some calculations (all that math they taught you does come in handy) and then you will know who many to cast on for the blanket YOU want to make.  You don't follow blindly patterns!  It's a blanket, so size is not critical.  Most people knit long panels and then stitch them together -- for good reason.<br>  <br>  And then just get to work!|`|rYNM67oyaa	Have you practiced making your stitches.<br>  <br>  With just the knit and purl and yarn over and knit two together you can make all sorts of fancy patterns, but you'll need to practice some before you tackle a blanket.<br>  <br>  Here's an easy pattern to do.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coatsandclark.com/Crafts/Knitting/Projects/AfghansThrows/WT1586+Knit+Seaside+Waves.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.coatsandclark.com/Crafts/Knit...</a>|`|PXWVGQyAaa	If you are just starting, it may be easier for you to make squares first and join them later.

It can be found at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wesnoth.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wesnoth.org/</a><br>  <br>  On Yahoo Games, I enjoyed Oasis, which is a downloadable game with a free version, sponsored by advertisements.  I found the advertisements which are shown only between levels are not disruptive to the game experience, and it's a well designed game.  See here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?gamekey=oasis">http://get.games.yahoo.com/proddesc?game...</a><br>  <br>  Sorry that I don't have a complete list of ten or more games, but these are a couple of good choices.<br>  <br>  Also, you will probably get better responses by asking this question again in a gaming category, using a more descriptive question such as "Where can I download good free games?"

Nz0teQLCaa	Graphically COD WAW is better.<br>  COD 4 has better weapons and perks.<br>  COD WAW has better and longer campaign, plus CO-OP campaign.<br>  COD 4 has less glitches. (I hate Glitchers)<br>  COD WAW takes more skill to play.<br>  <br>  The gameplay is exactly the same. Personally I prefer COD WAW, but I have nothing against COD 4. You can get COD 4 pretty cheap now so why not get both. Hope this helped. :-)|`|2Sbq3JNbaa	Depends on what you like.  If you want modern weapons and gameplay.  COD4.

j6MvCr6Naa	You should definitely get Resdient Evil 4, it has a lot of intense action, and many scary situatuations, some enemies later in the game will really scare you.<br>  <br>  Here's the average reviews score for Residnet Evil 4:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/cube/residentevil4?q=resident%20evil%204" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it got 96% meaning this game is absolutely amazing, add in Wii controls and it's even better.<br>  <br>  Resident Evil 5:<br>  <br>  Here's the problem with Resident Evil 5, it wasn't made by the same people that made Resident Evil 4 and the Resident Evil 4's lead designer was not even envolved in Resident Evil 5's development. So, let me just say that Resident Evil 5 is not as good as it's predecessor, and quite far from it to be honest. The level design is lacking, many places in the game can become frustrating and Sheva's A.I. is just not good enough. You would have more fun playing this game with a friend than by yourself. This game is also not even half as long as Resident Evil 5, it's singleplayer will take you less than 10 hours to complete. It's a sham really because I was really looking forward to do this and it really doesn't live up to Resident Evil 4. <br>  <br>  Here's the average score from different reviewes for Resident Evil 5:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform..." rel="nofollow">http://www.metacritic.com/games/platform...</a><br>  <br>  As you can see it's 87%, it's still a very good game but not as good as Resident Evil 4 and a bit of a dissapointment.|`|wGUQqZrVaa	if you want a scarier game go with 4. it has done been said in many reviews that 5 is not scary at all.and it's not it is however still an excellent game. in all honesty RE games stopped being scary at 3. resident evil 4 wasent scary much either it did provide a few scares.unlike resident evil 5 which has little to no scares. bassicly 5 is an upgraded version of 4. if you want a closer look see what critics have to say about it. good luck!|`|KFDzhDowaa	RE 4 to me is the best resident evil game ever made. None will surpass it. I have the demo for RE5, and I hate it. The way it is set up is just terrible after playing RE4 on the Wii.<br>  If you have a Wii, I strongly suggest getting RE4 instead of RE5 for any other system. <br>  <br>  RE5 is not that scary mainly because of the setting: bright and sunny....<br>  RE4 is dark and literally always night pretty much. Most of the first hour or so is in forest based levels.<br>  <br>  I say get RE4 and wait for a few reviews from like G4 for RE5 .
QqIvcYPnaa	Fallout 3 is one of the best games you will ever play!<br>  <br>  I haven't played Oblivion yet, mainly because i cant get a copy its always sold out!, but i have been told a million times, that if i like fallout 3 i will like oblivion lol, so yes you should!|`|fZsFhjceaa	Probably, you would probably enjoy the game play, it has a very similar engine and the RPG side of it is pretty similar, in that you do get a lot of side quests that there are multiple ways of completing with different outcomes.<br>  <br>  You will probably like it, even though the story line and stylings are VERY different.|`|7Ca2ns47aa	Not necessarily... <br>  <br>  I, too, loved Oblivion. However, for my own personal tastes, Fallout 3 is just not the sort of game for me. I find it... dark and depressing. Not to mention fantasy (magic, elves, etc.) is a passion of mine, especially over a "reality" game such as Fallout 3. Fallout 3 does indeed have side quests, along with a "main quest" as well, of course. I do believe it has "guild"-like similarities from Oblivion. I don't know you're particular liking in games, but if I were you, I'd rent it first. Most people do like it, so I'm not saying you won't.|`|5WMBekaAaa	I Convinced a friend of mine (Who beat oblivion in like a week) to buy Fallout 3. he hasn't had a chance to play it yet because his dad is too into it (He played Oblivion Obsessively too) so I Imagine you'll like Fallout. and it has like 75 side quests from what i hear|`|TmDabvoIaa	no guilds but heaps of side quests n other stuff. it's a great game. not oblivion tho, but still a great game. get it, after a few hours, you'll love it|`|JAGwwxpEaa	F3 is very similar to Oblivion.  I would definintely buy it if you enjoyed Oblivion.|`|lRx2673Jaa	Fallout 3 will be 10x better than Oblivion I would say. It has about 30 quests and side quests, a massive map, a lot of guns. This game will take a very long time to complete everything in the game. So you wil never get bored of it.
EFsM3t9Xaa	Umm...nothing comes out specifically for Florida.  Games aren't released by state.  The North America/Europe release date is March 22.

MYxPqOAgaa	Burnout Paradise and Midnight Club L.A. are open world racing games, where you have a map open to you like in GTA IV and you go complete missions/races. In GRID, you assume the role a driver for a racing team and compete to be the top team in the world. It a depends what you like but I'd say between GRID and Burnout Paradise because of the great attention and detail given to damage when you wipe out.|`|5WMBekaAaa	Burnout Paradise is good, i'd get that and GT5 Prologue.

x5aJcD9zaa	Is she pulling healing agro and getting killed by the mobs of the tank she's healing?  Or is she in the wrong positioning?<br>  <br>  If she is pulling healing agro, she really needs to spec 3 points into Silent Resolve (discipline tree).<br>  <br>  If she is getting killed because of not knowing the positioning or the raid fights, then she really needs to learn them better.<br>  <br>  Those are the only two reasons I can think of without actually knowing this player.

JAGwwxpEaa	Your connection to a game is highly dependent on the "Host" of the game.  COD4 is notorious for having terrible hosts that can barely handle 12 players.  I am usually at about 3 bars for connection and my download speed is around 10MB/s and upload speed about 750KB/s.  If you have less than 3 bars, leave the game and join a new one.  Keep joining until you have 3.  If you can't find a game with 3 bars, you gotta upgrade your internet service.|`|u9HfvzL9aa	Not your fault ....Host with bad connection

The cars must be parked out where they can be seen.<br>  <br>  - Losers will pose for pictures in whatever positions winners put them in and wearing whatever the winners stipulate including just their birthday suits<br>  <br>  - Losers will cook and serve dinner to winners each night of the weekend dressed as winners command.

Fk3TupqVaa	There are several primary areas that could be causing your computer to freeze.The most likely reason is that Corruption within your registry keys, registry classes, and registry settings.Any time you make a change to any of your computers settings and surfing online, they are stored and updated in the registry.Over time,the registry can grow to enormous proportions and full of junk and errors.So if you run a program,it will take a long time to required registry file and sometime it cant find its registry files since regsitry errors and then it has to sit there.So your computer will freeze. <br>  You need to run a self diagnostic program called regsitry cleaner.This program is very very useful,it can fix regsitry errors,clean registry remnant,corrupt files and temp files in a few minutes.Then give you a bran-new and high-speed computer.There are collection and comparison of top rated registry cleaner:<br>  <a href="http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.make-my-pc-faster.com</a> .You can download and scan your computer for free.|`|u0ydx14Yaa	I think its because your computer is just getting slow, and if its not that try to give it a rest it might work..|`|PmkQwacBaa	i guess... i can't tell cause you're not listing specific details about your comp but i'm guessing that you dont have enough ram memory to store all the temp data that combat arm requires or it might just be your cpu being too slow

If you build up your super combo bar, then look at your manual and practice them. Just try to get the correct analog stick rotations and hit the correct buttons. When it shows like a foot or a fist, it doesnt matter which button you hit, aslong as its a punch button or a kick button. Hope that helps

(Campaign)<br>  <br>  For on-line...I'd probably go with the Grenade Launcher, good assault rifle, or shotgun (up close & personal maps).<br>  <br>  As for joining factions...in the campaign, you don't. You're an "independant contractor" or "deniable asset"...commonly known as a "free agent."<br>  <br>  In the on-line game, you pick a character, and you are part of the faction that has that class in it. Outside that, you can have a "clan" that has members from both factions...but that is outside the actual game...part of the "metagame" as it were.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

EMjV0FQJaa	The official rules as I have read them say that you can pick up the card if you believe you and partner can make three tricks. The rule that you can't pick up is just a "house rule". If you have 3 aces, the Left, and a discard, you should easily be able to make your three tricks by picking up the right bower. Click the link below for my source - he makes sense to me.|`|OyW8z4Jxaa	i would say no, because you need at least one of the trump to be, and the left wouldn't be that trump before you pick up the right, so it wouldn't count as a trump.  this is just how I play, I haven't read this in a Hoyle book, this is simply the way I have always played.
ttfuh5pKaa	Hi -<br>  <br>  I love the Sizzix machines!  I have 5 of them (including the BigKick)<br>  Yes, you can use any of the Sizzix dies on it.  I do recommend that you get the cutting platform that looks like a book with tabs.  It offers you the versatility of using alot of the other dies like the embossing folders or the Texturz dies.  If you like, you can check out the machine on the Sizzix.com site.  They recently added tutorials showing you how to use the machine.  I personally recommend Sizzix to anyone!  I have well over 400 dies myself and am always looking for more!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...if you have any questions, contact me directly.|`|0WASp0bHaa	Yes you need the cutting pad and platform. Any Sizzix die will work in it. Plus all Cuttlebug dies, most Quickutz dies, and most Spellbinder dies will work in a Sizzix Big Shot or Big Kick. You can use all the embossing folders too.

They do a lot of fabrics, including patchwork cottons.  I bought something quite similar to the organza you posted the link for, but in cotton, last year.

mOTCr8Pxaa	Probably. Although everything up to now will work on both, probably games even beyond will work on both and be able to interact with both. The DSi has features that the DS lite does not so it is probable they will make games that caon olny work properly on the DSi.|`|uVX1CZwWaa	Nintendo actually stated they want the general public to decide the fate of the DS lite. If the DSlite continues to sell well, they will continue making games that work on it.<br>  <br>  However, some games in the future may take advantage of the built-in camera. But this would most likely be a bonus feature and not hamper the game on the DSlite.
