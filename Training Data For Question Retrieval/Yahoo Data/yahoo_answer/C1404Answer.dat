1TPGdaXJaa	It sounds like you know yourself, so remember who you are when something like this happens again. I am in some aspects the same way.<br>  <br>  I think my advice would be that when you get excited about something, give it time for the initial emotional impact to wear off before you make a decision. Sit with the idea, go over in your head all the pros BUT also all the cons. Wait until the emotional excitement of something new has worn off for you before you make the final decision.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	do you have a level headed parent to talk with?? if you are married, having kids isa good thing....something worth doing and it will get easier after the first birth and first 90 days...ok you arent married so do that first before the kids.....you are just trying to grow up....theres no rush if youre less than 21....otherwise comeon girl...you can do it...|`|d57099e9d0551bf1846f1f00f5fd9648aa	No there is nothing mentally wrong with you.  I sounds like you get excited by new ideas and that your immediate thoughts are that you want to do whatever the idea is.  You are probably ruled by your emotions.  It's just your personality.  The only thing I would caution you on is really thinking things through before you make definitive decisions. Going back to school, buying a home, having children.  These are things that require a great deal of thought and insight before you jump right in.|`|On57DVlAaa	Well you need to go to a Psychologist. Contrary to the popular belief, it does not mean you have issues, you are crazy, etc. It just means that you need help getting your emotions, feelings, and actions right. You need discipline. We all do. You need to set specific goals, and follow them. Concentrate on those goals, and avoid distraction along with procrastination. When you lack goals, and you don't know exactly where you are headed, then you are not going anywhere. You can't say you want to go to Rome, if you don't know how you are going to get there. <br>  <br>  You can't dream of meeting Jesus Christ if you don't know the facts. There is nothing wrong with having huge dreams but you have to make sure they are realistic. Let's use the typical example of losing weight. Say... I am going to lose TEN POUNDS in ONE MONTH. There is one goal. You can't say I am going to lose ten pounds... you are not stating a time, and therefore might never get there. Writing down your progress and rewarding yourself for something you do right is also good to keep up with your discipline.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Well, it seems that your question centers around impulsiveness by your definition.  Based on what you've said, I think you are just overly attached to your thoughts.<br>  <br>  You have thousands of thoughts rushing through your head every hour.  These are just thoughts, usually of no consequence, but due to the way we've been taught and our environment, we tend to take a lot of these thoughts very seriously.  If you are a very mental person this is made even worse.<br>  <br>  So what's the solution?  One way people deal with this is to meditate.  This allows you to watch your thinking without judgement or attachment.  Yoga or a slow exercise like Tai Chi or Chi Gong can also give you an opportunity to still your thoughts. <br>  <br>  When you get the opportunity to just watch your thoughts without attachment they become less powerful, less capable of causing you great distraction and distress.|`|bszyOuIqaa	Wow reading your question I have to say that I am the same exact way! However, I don't see my personality as a problem I believe it's just me.  I've started to keep a planner so that I can write down ideas that come to me. I also break up long term and short term goals.  I try to set my week up to reflect those goals so that I am doing something every week if not everyday to help me towards my goals.  I am NOT a organized person at all but I have so many thoughts, ideas, wishes, wants, fantasies that it helps for it to be in one place. It also feels good to know that I am working towards them.<br>  <br>  Oprah once said, "You can have everything, just not at once." I really live my life by this quote because it helps me realize though I have a lot of aspirations I have to time it right so I can have it all.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend does help me a lot too. I don't think he fully understands my personality but love it or leave it, it's me!  I think everyone has feared failure at one point or another, but the real failure is the person who dares to dream but doesn't have the guts to claim the dream, the person who doesn't try at all.  To just accept defeat without trying is a true failure so get out there and start or you will always be a failure.<br>  <br>  Write down all your goals. Tell someone (your boyfriend). Write it down.  Just as we use a map to guide a road trip or inteniary to plan a trip. We use blue prints to build a house. You should have a guide to your life.  This isn't do or die but it gives a general idea of the way you should be headed.  If you take a detour it's ok just keep going!|`|IJTTKdz3aa	the best thing 4 u 2 is follow ur heart n take life 1 day at a time. also cry when u have 2 dnt hold n any emotions. everythings gonna be fine dnt u worry. mabey ur boyfriend isnt supportive enough mabey u need a lil push from your loved 1s
GGfOn3Pgaa	I am exactly the same. Perhaps you might be a bit of a people pleaser, you don't like to let people down even if it is just a game of tennis. This ain't always a bad thing, but never do ANYTHING you don't want to do, don't be so hard on yourself and well done.|`|S6jIyOtwaa	aww hun, dont feel bad ! they had no right to force you into something you didnt want to do in the first place, therefore they should be the ones feeling bad !<br>  <br>  you just stood up and said you didnt want to do it, so dont feel bad that you stuck up for yourself :) it was good of you!<br>  <br>  if i was you id be feeling good !|`|e0d08c2181048633322f70afd6634965aa	Don't worry about it. If you sense they are upset with you just explain to them your reasons for not wanting to do it. If they are mature reasonable people they will understand.|`|Bsi4olK9aa	The reward of loving yourself 1st comes later.  You took an important step towards changing your habit of letting others decide for you.  You made the right decision because the key to being loved and loving others is to love yourself.  I think you friends would understand if you painted them the "big picture"..and in doing so, you might decide to play the game now and them after all because your goal NEEDS to be CONSTANCY.  Consistantly choose for yourself and be yourself. <br>  <br>  Since thoughts, feelings, and actions create:  Try repeating, "I fully and completely love and accept myself" everytime you feel critical of yourself or another.  It is natural to have doubts and none of us are perfect.  <br>  <br>  Self worth is gained through self discipline. Changing your habits will change your life and resulting relationships. <br>  <br>  Take command of your environment and you take command of your life.  We are all products of our environments.  <br>  <br>  Read Stephen Covey's book on 7 Habits or listen to his audio tape.  It will not only make you a better parent, but will also serve you well in every other relationship in your life.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you've done some of these steps.  Keep it up and remember that changing habits (that have resulted from patterns of thought, feelings, and actions) requires you to replace that habit with a new habit....thus requiring some level of constancy.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	say that you just want to play on local courts and not in the tournaments..|`|XiQhSDttaa	Because you don't like the fact that you (probly) disappointed them
BSnwIJ0oaa	Yes<br>  <br>  Hypnosis Myth #1<br>  Only weak-minded people can be hypnotized<br>  <br>  The truth is that everyone can be hypnotized.  As a matter of fact, each one of us are using hypnosis in some form every single day of our lives either consciously or unconsciously.<br>  <br>  We are experiencing some form of a trance-like hypnotic state each time we engage our imagination, each time we engage our emotions, each time our attention is focused upon our subjective experience.<br>  <br>  The goal of a hypnosis session is successful installation of a desired outcomes deep into the subconscious mind from where it eventually expresses automatically without any further conscious activity. <br>  <br>  We disempower ourselves when we choose limiting beliefs which reduce the number of available options toward reaching desired outcome; and we empower ourselves whenever we open ourselves to more options.<br>  <br>  The people that are easiest to hypnotize are those who have great imagination and are able to maintain the focus on the desired objective.  In other words, its people who still nourish that childlike quality of pretending, acting "as if" that which they desire to experience is their only reality.<br>  <br>   Hypnosis Myth #2<br>  Hypnotist has complete power over you when you are hypnotized<br>  <br>  People who play the role of a hypnotist are not only those who label themselves as hypnotist, but can be anyone who is skilled with using language, capturing another person's imagination or is perceived as having an authority by the listener in a given context. You could say that the first hypnotists we experienced in our lives were our own parents - even if they did the whole act of hypnotizing unknowingly.<br>  <br>  Hypnotist or another person who is playing the role of a hypnotist (knowingly or unknowingly) can have as much power over you as you give them. Hypnosis can be done in much more subtle ways than someone telling you to "take a deep breath and close your eyes now ... and hold onto every word I say ... because your life may depend on it". It may be a simple statement that someone utters which stimulates your imagination and more importantly your emotions - a statement of hope and encouragement or of some dismal consequences.<br>  <br>  It is always up to you, whether you are having a session with a hypnotist, listening to hypnosis recording or receiving information through some other media - from a doctor, a lawyer, a salesman, an ad in a paper, watching news, reading books or newspapers - whether you want to accept or reject the ideas and statements offered. For that reason we say that "all hypnosis is ultimately self-hypnosis" and that you are always in control.<br>  <br>  The role of a hypnotist in a therapeutic setting is to help you establish communication channel with your subcosncious in order to overcome your inner obstacles and reach your goals. All that any hypnotist can do for you, you can do for yourself on your own, too - if you take some time to learn self-hypnosis. A skilled hypnotist can help you a great deal simply due to experience and knowledge of variety of helpful techniques, but ultimately all the power is right in your mind and it is only a matter of learning to access it and practicing to develop, or rather unfold it so that you can accomplish anything you desire.<br>  Hypnosis Myth #3<br>  If you can hear the hypnotist, you were not hypnotized<br>  <br>  This misconception has probably come about due to another common misconception which equates the state of hypnosis with sleep. <br>  <br>  A lot of people believe that when they are hypnotized they will not be aware of anything that is happening around them.  Yet, if you lost all connection with the hypnotist, how could you follow the instructions? <br>  <br>  While the level of awareness of your surroundings may shift to some degree, you will still be aware of the hypnotist or his voice.  The better you are able to play the game of "let's pretend" and immerse yourself in your subjective reality (inner world experiences), the less will you be aware of your surroundings in the way that you are accustomed to.  That's why we call it - "altered reality". In this altered reality, your awareness of the hypnotist may change and you may interpret him as someone else - maybe a friend or a stranger or magician - but you will still be aware of the hypnotist's voice.<br>  Hypnosis Myth #4<br>  You can remain permanently stuck in hypnosis<br>  <br>  No one ever got stuck, but some people enjoy deep trance so much that they don't want to come out.  Imagine being in a state where your body feels so deeply relaxed that you may not need to pay any attention to it, and your mind is completely free of any stresses associated with your daily life and you are finally able to experience all of your most cherished dreams and secret desires come to life in full color with exquisite sensations.  At least here, perhaps for the first time, you are able to experience total freedom, inner peace and happiness and all seems absolutely perfect in your world.  You are in control. <br>  <br>  Do you kno|`|7o3DMzXQaa	yes it does work, but the hypnotized party must be a willing participant. the way you ask it makes it seems as if you want to know what hypnotists can "make" people do. they cannot just walk up to someone, hypnotize them, and just tell them what to do. the person being hypnotized must be willing, calm, and prepared to be hypnotized for things to work.|`|aa673f8d0b3f8397baf3af4288720b12aa	They say a hypnotist can't make someone do anything they don't want to do, something against their principles. I've seen shows on TV where people eat onions etc and do the most outrageous things.  I was hypnotised once to try to help me stop smoking and the hypnotist told me if I saw someone with a cigarette in their mouth it would look stupid to me, and to this day, and it was more than 20 years ago, they still do.|`|zWo03iLNaa	you still have control of yourself you are just so relaxed is what it feels like.|`|0nHkiSOVaa	Hypnotism is a real phenomenon.  However, it's usefulness outside of entertainment is unlikely.  The hypnotic state is simply a state of incredible suggestibility.  It's clinical use is highly controversial.  It is unlikely that hypnotism can be used for things like recovering repressed memories.  It is more likely that a therapist can implant false memories because of leading questions and a participant in a state that makes them eager to please.|`|NqiLnwxyaa	Hypnotism is delving with the demons, where do you think the power comes from?

I know, I know, you have changed, but, only on the inside. Now it's time to change on the outside. I believe the term is "dress for success". Throw away the clothes that show your underwear, your muscles, or your "bling", and start wearing clothes that you would wear to a high social business meeting or maybe what you would wear to church.

SoUDkOejaa	Your dreams do not necessarily result in to real life. What I mean by that is you have to learn to interpret your dreams. For example, if a person dreams they are pregnant, it means that they're going to meet someone new in their life etc. If you are really stressed out in your , dreams it might mean you just overcame a very stressful situation in your life, but your sub conscience is having a hard time overcoming that event in your life. Don't be to worried about your dreams. Your mind is capable of great things. Worry about your real life, because in the end life's a big influence on your dreams.<br>  <br>  Take care and message me if you need more advice!!!<br>  xoxo hun
AA12022384	Morals and ethics are regulated by society, the law and the church as well as by the individual.<br>  <br>  These vary depending on the society or religion a person lives in or follows and is further influenced by some peoples own moral and ethical code.<br>  <br>  In the end I think most people do define for themselves.  If you placed a number of people in the same ethical dilemma, for example; they all had a close family member who had a terminal illness and was in terrible pain who asked for help to assist them to die, you would get a number who would assist in helping the person to die and some who could not.<br>  <br>  Some of these people would find it impossible to assist due to a religious belief or because it was breaking the law, or their own moral code, while a number would believe that we all have the right to end our own lives when and how we choose and that to assist that person is the moral thing to do.<br>  <br>  Some people would call this murder others a mercy killing.<br>  <br>  Circumstances can change peoples moral outlook, for example; a woman who professes herself against abortion may well change her mind if she finds herself in the situation of having an unwanted pregnancy.<br>  <br>  So I think it depends on the individual and the circumstances which happen during their lives, which is why what can seem immoral to one person can be totally moral to another.|`|m89kGXBnaa	The *terms* morals and ethics have a set definition, but each individual will have their own morals and their own ethics.<br>  Basically, morals are rules about right and wrong conduct (independant of legality) and one person may believe it's right to drink and other may think it's wrong.<br>  Ethics are a system of moral prinicpals, i.e. someone might think saving life is important above all else, another person might think honesty is important above all else, so when asked to lie to save someone, they will act differently.<br>  <br>  There is no universal moral or ethical code, they change over time, across cultures and through societies. There is no end of people prepared to tell you their moral code is the absolute one though.|`|BkleL3F4aa	No both are subjective defined by the individual within parameters defined by various influences in society.|`|WkLJI40baa	Both, an average person will agree that a driveby shooting is immoral.

For example, who wants to stay awake at night knowing people are out there killing each other, with absolutely no accountability for it? <br>  <br>  But morals can also be defined based on individual experience. For example, if slavery were to continue without any backlash from the civil rights movement. How many whites would continue to enjoy their privileges of owning black slaves without any moral guilt? Does this mean that the slaves would accept their fate and not feel they were being morally wronged? Of course not.|`|dtug4wEdaa	look it up in the dictionary.|`|YQOT68xFaa	Not all morals are relative. Some things are wrong no matter what, like rape or murder, pedophilia, that kind of thing.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi,<br>  To dream of being in the bathroom means a need to cleanse oneself of negativity. <br>  And with the water means different things like your emotions. The state of the water will reflect the state of your emotions. Can also symbolize creative juices. A healing energy.<br>  Rising water is you may be getting in over your head, getting in too deep. An increasingly tough situation.<br>  And with the bed this means you may need more rest. May be commenting on private, intimate matters. Is something keeping you up at night? Your dream may even be commenting on your dreaming life.<br>  And the last one is cat, this often symbolizes your feminine, intuitive energy. Can also point to independence, fickleness, cleverness, pride, aloofness, balance, cattiness or any other traits you might associate with a cat.<br>  Hope that helps, good dreams to you :)

Projecting having sex with Jason may just mean there is need for attention seeking.<br>  <br>  In your subconscious mind, having sex is in symbol of attention seeking.  The movie lurked into your subconscious mind and translates into symbol of heavy and negative attention seeking.

8ldA7Z3Baa	Hahaha, thats awesome! <br>  <br>  EDIT: And ofcourse as obvious as that link is, some people are going to disagree. A lot of people are missing the point.<br>  <br>  EDIT: For those saying the situation isn't comparable because the man didn't kill his child. The point of this cartoon is, she's giving up her motherly responsability, and is celebrated for it. A guy does that and he's a loser for it. Thats a double standard. Keep in mind that most women who get abortions, don't do it because their lives are at stake. They do it for the same reason some guys don't want to be a father to the child. Because they don't want there lives to be ruined by having a baby.<br>  <br>  EDIT: For those saying, 'but it's the womans body on the line because she's pregnant'. They're forgetting she is responsible for getting pregnant in the first place. Just like the guy should have worn a condom or made sure she was on the pill if he didn't want a child, she should have been on the pill and made sure he had on a condom if she didn't want to be pregnant.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	Well, it depends on the case, see, this said double standard is put very vaguely. <br>  <br>  If I was to be labeled pro-choice or anti abortion, I'd be pro choice, not because I'd abort, I rather instead prevent from getting pregnant, but because I think a woman should be the one to decide (if there's a partner, along with him, obviously) whether she wants to have the baby or not.<br>  <br>  Besides, the man who doesn't want to be a father is selfish if leaving a family the same way a oman would be if she had the baby and left it.<br>  <br>  Also, women need the right to abort in general 'cause many girls are raped, other women if had a baby would die, and in some cases, both the woman and the child would die. Not all pregnant women chose to be pregnant, not all can afford to be pregnant, and for some not abortioning would be just wait for the baby to die on birth, which is even more horrible.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Actually, some of these people are right.  The situations aren't comparable.  If the man killed his own child, they'd be comparable (i.e. infanticide).<br>  <br>  I never expected to get 5 thumbs up for this one with no thumbs down.  This isn't a pro-choice supporting answer at all.|`|BkleL3F4aa	Yep its a double standard alright, interesting to see the fems defending it though.

If the man cops out and the woman has the baby, she has to go through pregnancy, birth and yrs of raising the child. If a woman cops out, the man doesnt have to do anything. <br>  <br>  Just biological inequality: women have a womb and men don't, and it does make a difference. Women are physically 'stuck with it' if they are pregnant, men aren't.<br>  <br>  And whoever is raising the child cannot be working at the same time - single parents rarely have enough money for nannies, and lots of people would pefer be with their kids. Therefore, people NEED benefits, or women NEED the financial support if they have a child.|`|c48xLEolaa	It's ridiculous. If a man gets a woman pregnant, she can abort it or give it up for adoption without his consent. If she wants to keep it, he cannot force her to have an abortion or place it up for adoption. It's a woman's choice and a man must agree with it - yet he is in some bizarre way seen as "responsible" when she chooses to use his sperm to produce a baby. <br>  <br>  It hearkens back to a time when a woman had to have a male protector - father, husband, brother, or son - to provide for her. But women can work and live independent lives now, and so it's idiotic to force a man to "provide" for a woman who chooses to be a mother. Many states are considering a "male abortion", whereby a father can sign away all rights and responsibilities towards a child, just as a mother can with adoption.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	Yes it is a double standard. I am pro life.<br>  <br>  Pro choicers can you be responsible, wear a condom, wear a patch, get birth control, take the morning after pill? TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN ACTIONS!!! But, people don't want to alas. That is what pro choice amounts to. "What is convenient for me?" It sickens me. There are no excuses!Selfish shameful generation.Where has human character gone?<br>  <br>  Yes a woman has the right to decide whether she wants to have a baby or not, but can she not do that before she has actually conceived the child? Why is that difficult? Are people that lazy,irresponsible and indifferent? She shouldn't be getting pregnant in the first place if she does not want a baby and she is in charge of that.|`|1xDtS8wwaa	How does it indicate a double-standard? He's a deadbeat and she isn't. I don't see any hypocrisy here. <br>  <br>  Please explain how getting a woman pregnant and NOT supporting her or the child is the same as getting pregnant and deciding to raise the child?<br>  <br>  I sense apologist issues on the poster's part....|`|f3c8a5f174ca386a6855ce97b71adbfbaa	If the man pays child support then he's not a deadbeat. If he bailed without doing anything to help the child, then yes he is. I'm pro-life, anyhow, so the woman is just as bad if not worse because she's responsible for the death of her unborn baby.|`|22GbdmXhaa	No, it's not a double standard, because it's not at all the same situation.|`|lqI8QZ9Eaa	There is 40 years of hard truth in that cartoon.|`|U1fToGvZaa	LMAO love it!|`|YQOT68xFaa	: )   Good one!

Do some research, schmuck. -.-|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I do think men should be able to completely opt out of fatherhood, as long as they make this decision right away, so the pregnant person has time to decide what to do, given that decision.<br>  <br>  They are NOT in the same situation however. HE doesn't bear the pregnancy. It's a fact of biology that females get pregnant; males do not.<br>  <br>  Saying that once  woman is pregnant, everyone on the planet EXCEPT her owns her body, she is a slave with no rights, is JUST WRONG.<br>  <br>  People who believe in freedom understand that it's the pregnant person's right to decide for themselves what happens to their own body -- not the government's not their neighbors, not the non-pregnant people.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I feel like they're different situations.  In one, a child exists, and in the other, it does not (having had been aborted).  It's comparing apples and oranges.<br>  <br>  If you wanted to compare two identical situations, it would be a father who decided not to care for his child, and a mother who decided not to care for her child.  It'd be interesting to see the double standard there, because I do think it would exist- I bet people would be a lot softer on the woman than they would on the man, simply because we have this stereotype in our head of the "deadbeat dad" that has no female equivalent.<br>  <br>  But yeah, the image just muddles things by bringing in abortion.|`|V1MptCMiaa	There's a difference between leaving your already born child and forcing somebody to have a baby they don't want.  It would suck if the government had ownership of my uterus and I didn't have a choice if I got pregnant.|`|zIqfIIlMaa	Good one.

Lor20kXcaa	No, not really.<br>  <br>  Sociopaths are highly intelligent offenders, who simply look at the world and think, well why not?<br>  <br>  They are usually genius or above, and completely and utterly lacking in empathy. They cannot conceive that other people actually have feelings, or worth.<br>  They do the things they do, simply because they can.<br>  <br>  Psychopaths do it for the self-gratitude.<br>  They are completely and utterly remorseless, and incapable of feeling sorry.<br>  They are never sorry, and they have an inability to learn from past mistakes.<br>  <br>  They are very different psychological problems and processes.|`|CNgVwJgEaa	No.<br>  <br>  Sociopaths are part of the intellegencia.

16vMIGPiaa	Grief is very normal but "destroying me at my core" is not.<br>  Sorry to hear about your loss.  The way to get beyond the grief is through it.  There are seven stages to grief; get stuck at any of them and one doesn't get on with life.  The trick is to identify where you're hung up and figure out how to get beyond it.  There's actually a lot of good material out there for dealing with grief based on the seven phases model.<br>  <br>  And - when my dad died, I had said all I needed to.  There was nothing left to apologize for or clean up.  I'm that way with my mom.  We live independent lives.<br>  <br>  You will be doing yourself and your husband a favor to figure out what the loneliness is about.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	That is sad. I love my mom I hope I die before her.

yS4GKSHRaa	I don't know you, but chances are you are not ugly.  Throw out the magazines and quit looking at adds.  When you look at real people and compare them to what TV, movies, and the media make women look like, you'll see how unrealistic your expectations can be.  And I think the most important thing is to remember that you are worth so much more than what other people see on the outside. <br>  <br>  I don't know what makes you valuable, but here is how I look at myself.  I have a body that cooks dinner for my husband when he comes home from work and I have arms that hold my son.  For him my body is the safest, coziest place in the world.  And for my husband, I am the best woman he's ever know.  For my family, I'm smart and helpful.  I'm creative and artistic, and my body, my hands, my fingers make my ideas into art.  So what does it matter what color my skin is, or what my hair looks like?  It doesn't change my value.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to say that looking good, well groomed, on the outside does not make you feel better about yourself, but I will say that no matter what you look like on the outside you will never be satisfied until you love what you are on the inside.|`|21dxo8rXaa	it could be the vibes you are giving off.  Being over weight has nothing to do with it.  it is all about confidence.
IVy35SE2aa	There is a lesson that your subconscious is trying to make<br>  known to you.  <br>  I attended a dream lecture by a psychiatrist who said dreams<br>  are like letters we receive in the mail.  If we don't look at<br>  them and try to analyze them, it is the same as bringing all the mail<br>  into the house and just trashing it without reading it.|`|AA12360662	Life time experience.  Many people in the area of 9/11 will have dream of end of the world or plane crashes.  Because what they experience, that is why they can have similar dreams.

9EVcTnUWaa	It would depend a lot on what the situation is.  It would also depend on who else it involved and how it would effect their lives.  One of the things programs like AA teach you is that making amends just doesn't depend on you but whom you want to make amends to.  If that's the situation that you're talking about. There are times when it's better to leave things in the past and just learn to live with what happened rather than try to change it.  Since you don't say what the circumstances are it's a little hard to advice you.  You might want to think if it will involve someone else also and it it might change their life in a negative way.|`|N45bUunaaa	Firstly, how you remember the past is only one version of what really happened. Secondly, the future isn't guaranteed by any choices you make today. So really you have to deal with a moral question, one that can only be answered by you. Is what happened in the past going to weigh on your conscious and affect your future anyway? Or is it something you can accept, as part of your past, and just get on with now. Your past, as you remember it, isn't that accurate and can only be used as a general reference to make decisions now that will affect what is to come.|`|aROi7KG5aa	We cannot change the past. We can only go forward and try to learn from past mistakes.

XYBHM8aSaa	I like to be around crazies.  The have all hook ups for drug dealers.|`|CjA02vNMaa	I wanted to become a social worker because of what the work required. I wanted to help improve people's lives and contribute to society. Especially since it's considered a career and your job is all about improving the life of people and the society they live in. However, sometimes social workers enter the field to fix their own lives so before entering this field it's important that you have concrete values and remain clinical.

You have nice dark skin, that girls pay big money to try and get. If anyone tells you you're not pretty, it's just because they are jealous of you!   No just because you love someone doesn't mean they will love you back, that's just the way it is.  It does't mean you'll never find anyone!  You haven't even given yourself a chance at life yet, you have lots to look forward to in your life!

WQlNNHuXaa	I most certainly would as I usually take the higher road in any situation. I do not reduce myself to immaturity and coarseness if a person has offended me and do not lower myself to that. There are people in my life that have been really vile characters and I always manage them with kindness and civility whilst detaching from them entirely. I should hope that is what a lady would do?And I tend to be very mannerly and polite and wear floral dresses in everyday life, so I suppose, I am a great big stereotype.<br>  <br>  And may I just say, being a grand stereotype feels REALLY good.

D6FBLQfwaa	My lord...you are certainly lucky! And I am certainly jealous! Alright, with that said, I recommend you get in contact with a historical/archaeological museum, and request some advice from a curator. What I can tell you is this: keep all paper and cloth items in a dark, dry place. Limit their exposure to the sun as much as possible. It would also be best to handle them as little as possible, since the oil on human hands is corrosive. If you must handle the paper, put them in a plastic sleeve or handle it with a clean cloth barrier of some sort.

Pay the money.Think about a lawyer.<br>  <br>  You need an inventory and to get the items on your homeowners insurance. <br>  <br>  There is also the question of heirs, estate taxes, probate and so on. Imagine you find something wonderful and valuable. What about "They were afraid to let their kids go through it because their kids were going to sell pretty much everything that belonged to them." Would those "kids' come after it claiming it's theirs? Could they claim that you cheated your fiance's great aunt and uncle? Is there a will? have they "given" you the items in writing? Could there be any question that it's yours fair and square. Apologies for sounding cynical. I had an in-law pass a year ago. With a will and friendly family and a great lawyer, we're still dealing with the paperwork.

Another possibility is (ironically) being over conceited and thinking that since you are so great, everyone has to listen to you. The last one I can think of is lack of tact which does not really apply to jealousy.

My mother in law was raised by a woman that always put her down, and burdened her with the care of younger siblings.  Her mother never thanked her for the help she gave with the younger children, and the lack of childhood she robbed my mother in law from having.  My mother in law is very verbally abusive to anyone married to her children and puts us all down in order to make herself feel bigger and important.  It is the scars from early childhood that cause this.

I'm the parent of two daughter's in their 30's so I can't fool my self into thinking that I'm a young adult any more.  How do I accept getting older, two ways. I look at my parents and realize that longevity runs in my family also that I've lived a lot longer than the doctors thought that I would.  I was supposed to die by the time I was 18 months old.  I was supposed to die again 16 1/2 years ago when I gave birth to my youngest daugther. So for me getting older is a good thing.  Second I have lost 4 siblings to death before they reached the age of 45 which makes you realize that you truly don't have any control over when you'll die.  Three of the 4 were killed in some sort of accident or one in a fight. Only one died from an illness. So I've learend early and well that age is just a number and I would rather have a high number than a low one.|`|myG2hhaKaa	You just have to realize that getting older is a part of life. Everyone goes through it. Yeah, there were things I used to be when I was younger. Most of them revolve around looks and weight, though. The only thing I miss from my youth that is mental (oppose to physical)  is hope and positivity. When we are young - elementary, middle school, HS we envision a good life, good jobs, etc. But as you get older, you start to realize it's harder to obtain our goals. As long as you can look on the bright side, and realize that things don't come very easily or may not come fully (and that's okay) then you should be happy with aging.<br>  <br>  You also have to look at the up side. Have you ever heard the phrase "I wish that I knew what I know now, when I was younger." Life experiences, education, etc. has made me a better person. There are some things that I can do now emotionally, socially, etc., that I could not do when I was younger.|`|tY14vbrKaa	I'm thrilled to death!  Nope, I can't do what I could once, but heck!

In a very bad part of my early life I often could not sleep until I fantasized about being killed by my tormentor while protecting someone else from him. I was 10.

t2sRfYgPaa	Make small goals for yourself. Tell yourself you are going to run a certain distance. For example, I run a riverside trail and I always make my goal to run past a certain tree. When you reach the goal you usually realize that you can go even further, so you make another distance goal, even if it's a shorter one. Just tell yourself you need to reach this goal and you can do it! :)|`|rygoLKr2aa	I also think how people would be disappointed in me if i quit|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	try telling yourself that it will be over faster if you get on with it. try pacing yourself better so that you're more liekyl to be able to keep going. if you set off too fast you will never be able to keep going no moatter what you tell yourself.|`|MuCNK2vxaa	Well, if it really matters to you, then you won't give up.

Try something like 'Lose Control - Missy Elliot' or 'Don't Stop Me Now - Queen' (to name a few). <br>  When you run, breathing can be a problem. Make a beat to breath to so you are not breathing unevenly and mess up. <br>  If you are in a race or a gym class, running with a lot of people and there are people a little faster then you, choose one to stick with. Keep at their pace, but if they don't keep the same pace, don't run with them. Just try to keep up. Don't let yourself fall behind. It is hard, but not only is it physical it is mental. So you have to tell yourself to keep it up and never slow down. Try to ease any pain and tiredness by talking to yourself (in your head so you don't waste your breath). <br>  Tell yourself to keep up the good work and just stay at that pace. Listening to music while running is great but if you don't have some music to run with, who cares. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsA song stuck in your head, helps you keep your breathing pace and although it sounds strange. <br>  Remember to do your best. Don't slack. <br>  Mental is the biggest battle. Other then that, just try to be in your best shape. And stay hydrated! <br>  If you have say 5 laps to run, don't think "I have 3 more!", Just think about how much you already have ran. <br>  Stay positive. <br>  If you are getting side cramps, try to run through them, if it has been a minute or 2 and they haven't gotten better, slow down to a slower run or jog, but don't stop (unless you need too). <br>  A good trick to get rid of side cramps is to find the side that has a cramp (left or right) and every step that you take with the foot on the cramped side, exhale firmly. The cramp should go away in about 30 seconds. <br>  If you have lost a loved one or a dear friend, imagine they are standing at the finish line waiting for you. <br>  When you begin to feel tired, don't stop, make yourself feel good. Try thinking things like "Just keep running until you get to the finish line. (an object up ahead)." Once you get there find another object to run to. Before you know it, you will have made it to the finish line, without having to stop once.|`|JWNzoksmaa	running is endurance..and the only way you get endurance is by practice.  you need to run everyday for at least 30 mins.

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Basically, you have to find the feminist aspects of the book 'Sula'.  You could write about the fact that Sula was extremely modern for her time.  She was independent, did whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted, and with whomever she wanted.  If I'm not mistaken, the book took place in the early 20th century, where races did not mix, and she had relationships with White men, regardless of society's opinion of her.  I read the book 8 years ago, so I'm a bit rusty.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In a way,  yes.  You're supposed to write about the book from a feminist's perspective.  For instance, how would a feminist feel about Sula's personality, versus how the other women in the town are?  How would a feminist feel about the roles of women in that time?<br>  <br>  EDIT: No problem.  Sometimes it's easier to ask other people's input instead of just looking at Google, which doesn't always give you what you want.|`|AA12022384	Take a look at these essays, they are free, they should help.|`|phJfL2wTaa	There is nothing to understand, you must just accept the feminist view on it, understanding would imply logic.<br>  <br>  Here is your paper, for a price:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/96148.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.academon.com/lib/paper/96148....</a>

myG2hhaKaa	We all have times when we get little sleep - for whatever reason (family problems, just couldn't fall asleep that night, staying up late to study, etc.) - but it can't turn into an everyday thing.<br>  <br>  I, first of all, would find out why they didn't get much sleep. And educate them on the importance of sleep. It makes us me refreshed, alert, energized, and keeps us healthy.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I would tell them to trudge on through the day, to imagine that in 8 short hours (or whenever the case may be) they can go back home and sleep, sleep, sleep. Hopefully working (and maybe even a little caffeine if they take it) will get them through the day. Try to keep things interested- engage in conversation, joke with them, etc.<br>  <br>  But, as I said, hopefully they can change something in their schedule so they get the required 8 or so hours needed to feel rested. Maybe they should work on time management, etc.
agpCn6Kaaa	The punishment should fit the crime, and if this kid isn't learning his lesson from being put on restriction so frequently, then there should be an alternative to 'being grounded'....for example, loss of privileges AND assigned chores to "work off" their punishment.  Sadly, with some children, any form of punishment is questionable as to whether it is effective of not...which leaves parents frustrated and at a loss as to what to do to address bad behavior.  Most kids at the age of 12-13 don't really mind the isolation all that much...and if they still have internet access and telephone they're not really isolated.  They really need to lose the things that matter to them the most for it to work.  Some parents strip their child's room completely, leaving only a mattress and blanket in an effort to get the unruly kid to change their ways.  Unfortunately sometimes nothing works.|`|mQD9kdMDaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  'Cause honestly?

Nope.  <br>  If the child is grounded for weeks at a time, they obviously did something which required discipline.

(just for clarification). If so, there was a female Pope once - Pope Joan (though I think she went by John). <br>  <br>  Even today, this would be an odd place to find a woman - actually, (and unfortunately), it's not common to find women in positions of leadership in many Christian denominations (or ultra-conservative sects of many other organized religions). Women are certainly more than capable of doing well in these positions - as more enlightened denominations have shown, but are prevented from holding the positions due to things like misogyny and political power playing in *some* organized religions. <br>  <br>  Certainly, you'd find a lot of references from both sides of that debate.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	Sorry, Women were and are still today excluded from the ranks of knights.

This comes from ego, and the ego within  these people must be "stroked" continuously so that they are protected from the fears being repressed within themselves.  Their intelligence comes from their attention being "fixed" in the Left-Hemisphere [in thinking] most of the time.<br>  <br>  The fact is, the truly  healthy person with Knowledge [as opposed to the person with highly developed ability to "think" as compensation for being locked out of intuition],  would be difficult to recognize as such, even after several meetings of this person.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|FwuyxxoWaa	That's tricky, as the concept of intelligence may have nothing to do with grades, they may be supremely logical or great at problem solving, therefore it is very difficult to 'stereotype' an intelligent person.

E1Tbhswbaa	There were many cons and not many pros that I can think of by bringing dinosaurs into the present besides learning about things, such as behavior, they could not find through fossils.  The obvious con is the potential deaths of many innocent (and many not innocent in the movie and novel) people.  Also, nature will always find a way (as stated my Ian Malcolm) and the dinosaurs evolved to adapt and survive.  They changed their sex (they were all female and some changed to male because of the frog DNA they had).  Man can not control nature or change the natural order of things, it may seem like he can for a while, but eventually it will spin out of control, collapse, and essentially fall apart (known as the Malcolm effect in the Jurassic Park novel).  At the end of the novel (not sure about the movie) some of the raptors escape off the island.  They migrated into the forest where it would be nearly impossible to find them.  <br>  <br>  There is no real purpose or need to bring dinosaurs into the present.  The reason to bring them into the present would be for amusement and profit such as Hammond is doing in Jurassic Park.  The positive reason, as I mentioned before, would be for study, but there could be many negative consequences and people who would take advantage of the opportunity for their own personal gain.|`|c5b60ac3242a47478e9f3294c17cf65faa	Change brings both good and bad.<br>  More horrifying than Jurassic Park,<br>  would be a world with no change<br>  at all.
yfxhrxm2aa	This may  be worth thinking about....<br>  The slug you mention could represent in your waking life a "spineless person", or else slimy, lazy or sluggish person. Is it you? Is there someone you'd like to punch or slug? Maybe there is a person in your life, taking over, sapping your time, your energy, your emotions and your financial resources.|`|mHkbbtymaa	that sounds creepy, i don't know what to tell you...|`|a154ad93c3423fde247192bf1019d743aa	this is what it says in the dream moods dictionary<br>  <br>  Worm <br>  <br>  To see a worm in your dream, represents weakness and general negativity. You have a very low opinion of yourself or of someone in your life.   <br>  <br>  To dream that the worm is crawling on your body, indicates that you feel someone around you is taking advantage of your and feeding off your kind heartedness. <br>  <br>  and this is what dreamsleep.co says:<br>  <br>  Worms Dreams - the Hidden Meaning <br>  <br>  Psychological Meaning: These may be phallic symbols. Associated with dirt and decay worms may indicate that you have negative attitude to sex. Alternatively, they may symbolise helplessness. If you feel downtrodden and oppressed, perhaps its time for the ‘worm to turn’.<br>  <br>  Mystical Meaning: Dream books claim that worms are a danger of infectious diseases. If you dream of destroying worms, you will receive money.
AA12360662	Well, you may be feeling a little insecure things that may be lost in some way.  Friendship is one of them.  <br>  <br>  Projecting best friend dumping you actually suggests that you are feeling the need for support.  You want others to respect you more.  Being dumped is a symbolic way to say you are no longer needed or left out. Perhaps, in reality, you encountered some situation that you feel left out and that may be also why you projected this kind of dream.|`|WLm7hrhHaa	it means they Betrayed you !|`|7dd4551dd14a193bbe6c6ad7c8445666aa	If it was in a dream, don't worry.

XYBHM8aSaa	Right now you are emotionally overloaded.  You're mom is going through a lot too, and its not right what she is saying to you but, deep down in her heart she probably doesn't mean it.  <br>  <br>  My dad use to abuse my mom and my mom took it all out on me.  When I was little she would say she hated me, she wished I was never born and that it was my fault he hit her.  TMI, but I say it cuz I sort of understand you situation.<br>  <br>  You can't let your feelings control you.  I know its hard, but you know the right things to do and you have to do them.  That is the only way you will stay sane through this.  Otherwise you will turn down and emotional, self esteem reducing, dysfunctional path that will take along time to work through and probably hurt many people along the way.  <br>  <br>  Your girlfriend love you, you need to show it back.

You are not him, you don't have to make his mistakes.  <br>  <br>  Right now, don't let your emotions control you.  You may have to block stuff out for awhile until you get in a better state of mind.

EUyXOwuZaa	official answer: This is normal, teachers dot his to "aim" the pocket thing i to make sure your not hiding anything.<br>  <br>  My answer: School paddling is a way of instilling fear of authority in you so you'll respect those in positions of power over you. Without this training  and the mindset most people have that not fearing authority is a bad thing, people in positions of power would have a harder time pressing their will on you as an adult. Without fear of authority people would have never put up with all the crap people in positions of power try to pull on those beneath them. It also helps to remember that paddling was first invented as a way to subjugate slaves and make them "fear" the authority of their masters.

jjwdSeYTaa	Definitely Marxism! The two have nothing in common:<br>  <br>  Social Darwinism (SD) is the belief that the better off should not help the poor or disadvantaged, because this goes against evolutionary theory. That is, those who are doing well in society are the 'fittest', and we should not pollute the genepool by sustaining those who are less successful. Note that Charles Darwin was NOT a Social Darwinist! SD in fact goes against Darwin's theory of evolution, since he found evidence of co-operative behaviour in social animals, and concluded that being good to one another improves everyone's chances of survival, therefore co-operation = fitness and SD = hogwash.<br>  <br>  Marxism is the belief that the human race is on an implacable path toward a perfect, egalitarian society, where everyone will be paid fairly in proportion to their needs and their labour. It's an extremely complex theory but it is, in many ways, backed up by the evidence. Feel free to email me and I'll have a crack at explaining it. Otherwise, try Wikipedia, the fountain of all knowledge :)|`|aBgb0Fu3aa	marxist because other people used his example and actually put it to use
bNhfXFHnaa	Expressing yourself around people you don't know: Try pretending you're somebody else. A television or book character, whatever. Pretend to be somebody confident that you look up to. I found that this helped me out when I was very socially awkward. (Now I'm just slightly socially awkward, haha.)<br>  <br>  Anger: I'm not sure how you act when you're upset, but I have a friend who just shuts down when she's angry and offers no explanation. Sometimes I find that a little hurtful and even offensive. If you're angry or upset, it's okay to act that way, but maybe you should let your friends know that you're not angry with them. Just say, "Oh, I'm really mad because of (blahblahblah), it's not your fault." I do not encourage you to bottle up negative emotions, but it's good to let the people you care for know that they are not the cause of it.<br>  <br>  However...I have mixed feelings about this, because I believe that you should act as you feel the majority of the time, and not allow others to dictate your emotions.

vt4Vh85Saa	Stroking the chin is often a signal that the person is thinking hard. They may well be judging or evaluating something, particularly if the conversation has offered them a choice or decision to make.<br>  <br>  The head is a heavy object and is often propped up by holding the chin in a cupped hand, particularly when the person is tired and it may drop. Boredom can make you sleepy and a hand under the chin may be done to stop an embarrassing drop of the head.<br>  <br>  Holding the chin also prevents the head from moving and can signal that the person wants to send a head signal but simultaneously does not want to send the signal, for example when they emotionally agree and want to nod, but intellectually want more information so they can have good reason before they say yes.|`|4T9fZzITaa	haha really<br>  well i think it may mean he's a bit nervous around you and that has just become a habit now.. <br>  does he do that around anyone else? if so then its definitely a [bad] habit if he only does it around you then he's nervous and he proly likes you :D|`|1xDtS8wwaa	It doesn't mean anything, really.

WQlNNHuXaa	Well in some cultures the mere fact of menstruating and having breasts and all that jazz is enough to qualify me. But in Western society, obviously we complicate the criteria somewhat. I do not consider myself a woman just yet. I am advanced in certain aspects of my growth and maturity, lagging behind in others, and have this terrible asynchronous development going on inside me. I am still a virgin, 20 years old, finishing my degree, living with parents, rather shy. So, in all these senses, I am not autonomous just yet. But, I have found in very other significant senses I can be more mature, and "good" then women 20 years my senior. And I also think being a real woman is about being wise, compassionate, not prone to fits of jealousy or spite but I have met many women who possess all the superficial adornments of womanliness "job, car, house, emotionally self contained" and yet they also open up a perspective of arrogance, condescension and hypocrisy and I lose a huge amount of respect for that.

Knowledge is gained by the ears, not the mouth. He must seek truth over comfort, mercy over revenge, love over selfishness, strength over weakness, and service to others over service to himself. A Man knows his place in the world, understands the times he lives in, and knows what needs to be done to better his life and those around him.|`|QRPvIB8Yaa	"man enough",, there are features of masculinity that we all need in various situation such as in combat or bussiness. And stanima produces health and physical prowess. We should all have at least a little bit of man. This is why women in bussiness are said to need and often the successful ones are said to have balls. While a men without features of masculinity isnt seen highly at all.<br>  If man and masculinity are the same then masculinity has to achieved to an extent. It is predicated on discipline and primarily bodily discipline. This is why sport is such a powerful part of the male psyche. It is a set of skills and physical prowess which we can judge masculinity by. Another aspect of this achieved physicality is sexuality, men are men if they are horny and horny for women. If you dont like women your are often defined not only as not being masculine but limp wristed emotional, preverse and wrond. You are a pyhsiological or psychological mistake caused by either bad genes of bad family relations.  If you cant get a hard on you are robbed of a basic part of your masculinity you become and object of shame. Finally there is the psychophysical men are thought to be hardwired by there testosterone for nonemotion:boys dont cry.<br>   But man and mans body are not always the same. The male body rebels against men. Stanima in masculinity takes no account for lightweights in drinking contests but it is also telling link to male substance use and drinking how their bodies turn stanima into addiction, then there is the gay male if not self repressed will be repressed by other males because he isnt what is known as man, if you have erectile dysfunction then you are less of a men yet very representative among a lot of males statistically, emotional constriction is one of the principle reasons why young men are over-represented in suicide statistics.|`|WQlNNHuXaa	The Head of Faculty where I study is everything one would consider "manly"- A leader, confident, independent, own house, own car, has initiative.

vHbiUhOCaa	Anyone, no matter how smart, can get bad grades! <br>  Getting bad grades does not mean you are 'dumb'.<br>  <br>  Back when I was doing science in secondary school (that's what we in the UK call high school), I was really good with the class work and always did well. But whenever it came to doing exams and tests, I would end up with awful results!<br>  I am just one of those people who do much better with work than they do with exams, I'm sure lots of other people are like that too.<br>  <br>  The problem with exams is that you have to revise all day and all night and when it comes down to it, you've only got the one chance to prove your 'intelligence'. All you need to do in exams is memorize things off a textbook or from your notes.<br>  Work requires you to research and study more, I would know!|`|ZOYyfBFYaa	If you're talking about a really smart person, an 80 is bad for them. So yes, they do get bad grades sometimes.|`|ToILKl6waa	Smart people are human too. They may have a strong intellect, but human error tends to rise above that at times. A few bad grades does not define how smart a person is.|`|1iXvphNYaa	As long as you put forth a good amount of effort there is no bad grade. Truly everyone possesses ignorance in some form or fashion what separates individuals are those who choose to try harder and use all the resources available to learn and eliminate as much of that ignorance possible and those who are complacent. Peace.|`|1cYPOJkqaa	Yes. They get fed up studying sometimes. Or on the rare occasion they don't understand something, they don't say anything to their teacher. Then when the test comes they aren't fully prepared so they don't do as well.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	Yes they do. I mean I ain't super smart but I can do really well in tests sometimes and that doesn't mean I'm super smart, it means I got lucky or I had a very good day. :)|`|hwRZ7DY7aa	There was this kid once that lived in Ulm Germany some 100 years ago. His teacher told his mom he would never succeed in life because he was a lousy student. At the age of 15 that kid dropped school because he had terrible grades especially in history and languages.<br>  After that he decided his field of interest was mathematics and physics.<br>  That kid was Albert Einstein one of the most intelligent successful  scientists of all times.<br>  <br>  That and other cases proves that the education system doesn't have the correct scales of measurement to evaluate a person's intelligence. Good grades are often the result of good memory or just taking the time to study hard.|`|ADjeuxIiaa	Getting a good or bad grade isn't solely based on intelligence. If a person of extreme intelligence doesn't read the directions on the assignment or just doesn't put in the effort of doing some of the homework would receive a bad grade.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, if a person of lesser intelligence worked diligently to research each question thoroughly or even invest in a tutor, their grade would be more satisfactory.|`|RLcFyq11aa	Bad grades can mean many things. They can mean you're stupid, true, but it's more likely that they mean you either aren't trying or simply don't have the very specific, not-very-useful intelligence that school grades measure.

3cb1b9273ff7534ec3ef0fd97957cdacaa	Being equal isn't about being physically equal.  Is a small, weak man who could never win in a fight less of a human being than a 6'5" professional athlete?  No, of course not.  Just because he is physically weaker doesn't mean he's less of a person.  <br>  <br>  As for me, I think it's inappropriate to attack anyone PERIOD.  But, I think it's even more inappropriate to attack someone who is weaker than you and who stands no chance against you.  This doesn't apply just to men and women.  In the aforementioned example of a tiny weak man and a huge professional athlete, it would be totally inappropriate for the big huge guy to go after the small guy.  Likewise, it would be inappropriate for a professional female boxer to go after a regular man.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Attacking someone who can't beat you is dishonorable.  Attacking someone who you can't possibly beat is stupid, but it's not dishonorable.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, why doesn't society frown upon a woman hitting a man?  Well, at the root of it, I DON'T think it's because she's a woman.  I think it's because she's (probably) physically weaker.  By the same token, I think more people would frown upon a huge professional athlete attacking a small man than a small man attacking a huge professional athlete.  Do you see what I'm getting at here?  In almost all cases in which there is a physical altercation, the woman is going to be the under-dog.  And people tend to support under-dogs.  <br>  <br>  I don't think it's just about physical altercations either.  If a genius challenged a remedial math student to a chess match and the remedial math student won, loads of people would be supportive and pleased.  If the genius won, most people wouldn't feel happy about it and they would in fact frown upon the genius for issuing the challenge in the first place.  <br>  <br>  In short, when it comes to physical altercations women are the under-dogs, and people support under-dogs.  I'm not saying that this is right or fair.  It's not.  But that's what I think is going on.|`|pYimIJAWaa	None of the feminists I know condone violence in a relationship, no matter who is perpetrating it.

Look at Chris Brown, everyone is going on and on about what he did to her, but it turned down she was ***** smacking him over a text that a woman SHE introduced him to was trying to steal him away. Not only did she start hitting him without knowing anything, she immediately assume he was actually cheating, when he could have been shooting her *** down.  And then there's that little rumor about Ri giving chris a STD or two. And that's just the current most popular case, you look into feminism you can find a LOT more examples of this kind of behavior from women.  It was never about equality, it was just a new form of hate groups. Why you think they're called feminazis? Heh, if you think this is bad, you should see the excuses they came up for women lying about rape.|`|dzalU4tBaa	lol shows even the cops are bent as hell.....so im guessing if she stabbed him and he pushed her away the cop would still arrest him and giver her a foil blanket<br>  <br>  EDIT:i wont hit a women first but as soon as she raises her hand to me i no longer consider her a women...shes fair games and it would only ever take one punch i garuntee it.|`|deb263b4b540e6e15eba4bdb58835e4aaa	I agree that all violence is abhorrent.<br>  <br>  Yes, the idea is that "women are weaker" so it's no biggie. This is a myth, however. Not all women are weaker than all men; being hit hurts; other violence does serious damage (throwing things, weapons, pushing downstairs). And violence and emotional abuse hurt the victim, whatever everyone's sex.<br>  <br>  I fully support a shift toward taking ALL domestic violence seriously.

vvgmyX04aa	I don't see there is a basis in jurisprudence for "counterbalance" laws like paper abortions.<br>  <br>  Equal rights for women is pretty straightforward in most things, it's just saying that both men and women are adult human beings and should have the rights and freedoms of adult human beings. <br>  <br>  Reproductive rights is a special case because of the obvious biological realities. It is women who get pregnant and bear children and can get pregnant by accident and have the risks and difficulties of pregnancy and childbirth. The consequences of pregnancy are always greater for a woman. <br>  <br>  So I don't see where the ethical justification for a "counterbalance" like paper abortion is. It certainly isn't for equal rights because it's effect is asymmetric and favours men over women and children.<br>  <br>  <br>  And yes, I get it that saying abortion is a woman's choice means that the wishes of the father can be overriden either way. But doing anything else denies a woman's ownership of her own body and forces hardships on her, unlike a man who still owns his own body without such restrictions. <br>  <br>  Again, I understand that men who want to be fathers or do not want to be fathers may not like this and think it unfair to them. But the truth is that they have a choice to not have sex with women who feel differently about having children than they do. This shouldn't be a problem for people to talk about if they are mature enough to be having sex.|`|67204bd052a33365d7bd0f82da0dcc95aa	'counterbalance laws' seem like the inevitable outcome of 'gender neutral' approaches to many social dilemmas and problems. They obfuscate serious issues and drive existing ones which adversely affect many women back 'underground' - rape, domestic violence etc. <br>  The look on the UK Home Secretary's face today sums up my point..our government are launching halfbaked VAW laws without clear analysis, based on clouded 'gender neutral' interpretations. Chief executives of the major domestic violence charities told her how nonsensical they are and she nearly choked...basically, the government should concentrate on eradicating discrimination against women, ensuring the equal oportunities legislation they have introduced is enforced...rights not bloody outcomes.<br>  Be careful, posting a sensible, articulate question is as rare as hen's teeth..thank you..lol x|`|p0LsYvJTaa	But many women are unwilling or unable to have an abortion, so we can't assume that it's a viable option in all cases.

THlYgi0Kaa	The triangular theory of love is a theory of love developed by psychologist Robert Sternberg. The theory characterizes love within the context of interpersonal relationships by three different components:<br>  <br>  1..Intimacy – Which encompasses feelings of closeness, connectedness, and bondedness. <br>  2....Passion – Which encompasses drives that lead to romance, physical attraction, and sexual consummation. <br>  3...Commitment – Which encompasses, in the short term, the decision to remain with another, and in the long term, the shared achievements and plans made with that other. <br>  The “amount” of love one experiences depends on the absolute strength of these three components; the “type” of love one experiences depends on their strengths relative to each other. Different stages and types of love can be explained as different combinations of these three elements; for example, the relative emphasis of each component changes over time as an adult romantic relationship develops. A relationship based on a single element is less likely to survive than one based on two or three elements.|`|6W9joRbVaa	It's also known as the Eiffel tower.

When they see someone sitting there being quiet, not laughing, not engaging in small talk, etc, they start to form negative views about that person. They are snobby, they are weird, they are slow, they are dangerous, etc. <br>  <br>  We live in an extroverted world. We are used to people screaming, yelling, jumping up and down, to get their point across. When someone is not doing the same, we say, "What's up with them?"<br>  <br>  They don't realize that some people, introverts, don't require or crave as much social interaction as others. Introverts are just as smart, nice, friendly, creative, aware of their world, as extroverts. But, they don't feel the need to talk as much and are just happy with the few friends they have. <br>  <br>  I know I have a low social threshold, but it doesn't mean I am not like everyone else.

Just try and make sure that some of your traits obscure your life, ie Need to Dominate (which is quite high), but others, like Individuality are great to be high. Your snapshot (although very broad) indicates that you are a shy individual and quite solitary, which are not necessarily bad as such, but you must use it well, for example when working, try not to do it in a crowded environment because subconsciously you will be panicky inside (I don't know your age or anything, so I'll be general).|`|sE2RH0A7aa	Extraversion   ||||||   22%<br>  Stability  ||||||||||||  42%<br>  Orderliness  ||  10%<br>  Accommodation  ||||||||||||||||  70%<br>  Interdependence  ||||||||||||||  56%<br>  Intellectual  ||||||||||||||||  66%<br>  Mystical  ||||||||||||||||  63%<br>  Artistic  ||||||||||||||||||||  83%<br>  Religious  ||  10%<br>  Hedonism  ||||||  23%<br>  Materialism  ||||||||||  36%<br>  Narcissism  ||||||  30%<br>  Adventurousness  ||||||||||||||||||||  90%<br>  Work ethic  ||||  16%<br>  Humanitarian  ||||||||||||||||||  76%<br>  Conflict seeking  ||||||||||||||||||||  83%<br>  Need to dominate  ||||||||||  36%<br>   <br>  Romantic  ||||  16%<br>  Avoidant  ||||||||||||  50%<br>  Anti-authority  ||||||||||||||  56%<br>  Wealth  ||||||||||  36%<br>  Dependency  ||||||||||||||||  63%<br>  Change averse  ||||||||||||  43%<br>  Cautiousness  ||||||||||||  43%<br>  Individuality  ||||||||||||||||  63%<br>  Sexuality  ||||||  30%<br>  Peter pan complex  ||||||||||||||||||  76%<br>  Family drive  ||||||  30%<br>  Physical Activity  ||||||||||||||||  63%<br>  Histrionic  ||||||||||  36%<br>  Paranoia  ||||||||||||||||  70%<br>  Vanity  ||||||||||||  43%<br>  Honor  ||||||||||  36%<br>  Thriftiness  ||||||||||||||||  70%<br>  <br>  <br>  I dunno, do I?|`|2X21VcVJaa	A people person, although private.

OwB0ROPmaa	Hello!<br>  <br>   From my understanding of Tourettes, it is caused or at the very least heightened by mis-communication of the brain's signals. While it CAN be consciously suppressed for a short period of time, it usually results in built-up, intense outbursts of tics. Medicines CAN and SHOULD be used to help control Tourettes, however over-medication can have another negative effect, causing the brain to mellow-out, and the person to become withdrawn. Psychologists generally size a person up for a few minutes, and reach for their handy-dandy prescription blank. They believe medicine is a cure-all. A neurologist on the other hand deals with the way the brain works from a PHYSICAL level. Assessing how the brain's info is being transfered & stored & helping the patient through the combination of drugs, various mental therapies, even suggesting environmental changes that may be benifitial. My advice would be to find someone who is genuinly attentive to your son's individual needs, as oposed to someone who collects certificates in his/her office & doles out more drugs than the corner Duane Reade. (((That's just my $0.02)))<br>  <br>  As for the OCD, if it isn't super disruptive, I say channel his efforts into positive endeavors. One of my OCD traits that started in childhood & followed me into adulthood (now 26), that I redirected to something positive is that I NEVER spend coins, EVER!  Every time I spent a dollar, the coins would go under my mattress (until the box-spring broke, haha!) At this time I have several hundred pounds of coins saved up, probably enough to buy a nice used car.(if I ever spend it)<br>  Like I said before: It's a "gift", if harnessed in a harmless way ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  One thing that my mother & I have been told countless times by numerous people is that these "disorders" are a result of the brain lagging behind the body's development and they should deminish through the 20's, allowing drugs to be weaned off. I must admit, it seems to have held true (to a degree, haha).<br>  <br>  <br>  I sincerly wish you & your son the BEST outcome possible! : )<br>   Take care -- Vince <br>   peerless_503@yahoo.com|`|m89kGXBnaa	Probably a psychiatrist as Tourettes is more than just a neurological disorder and neurologists will not typically deal with OCD but psychiatrists do quite regularly. A psychitrist is also more likely to offer therapy alongside drug treatment.<br>  <br>  Of course, it's entirely your son's decision.
0aaa10bf1334628de7df8d1527e7a5a7aa	Whoa, whoa, whoa! Son, if you ever find an enemy he going to have to work 25 hours a say just to beat you at your own game! Do you EVER give yourself a break?  And now along comes a perfectly useless study that tells us what we were always afraid of. Look, we all like attractive looking people - but everyone has flaws! I once worked for a designer who said,"There are only 12 perfect looking people in New York at any time... and they work A LOT!. The rest of us have to muddle through." So they wrapper isn't perfect... if the contents are quality, you can still be amazingly attractive. First, attitude adjustment - the world needs kind people more than it does pretty ones: start by being kind to yourself. Oh yeah, have you ever seen a picture of Napoleon?

Even if not quite legal or something that you would not want publicized widely?   Use your creativity, and if you have none then develop it.  Read, draw, sketch, think and then do more of each until you come up with a "new" idea that "fits" what you like to do.  <br>  <br>  Life is two edged.  One edge cuts against us and the other we wield against life.  The weak just stand still and are cut down.  The fearful get cut down running away from life.

Not many people look at life successfully.<br>  <br>  If you feel your body is inhibiting you, then by all means take the problems and resolve it. Your height is something you can't help, though you can wear padded shoes to give you 2 or 3 inches of height. But if you lose weight, sometimes you will appear even taller since your body would appear to be more vertical.<br>  <br>  By all means, its what you want to do. If you want to lose weight, I know you have the motivation to do that. Just look ahead and imagine yourself thinner. Exercise and make it fun. I don't know how eating works for you, but I know that I can't allow myself ANY junk food if I want to lose weight. But I know other people, like my sister, allows herself to eat some junk food in MODERATION. Find what works best for you. Good luck. You can do it.

He can take her to movies, he can take her to the mall and do a daddy daughter day.  He can take her out for lunch just the two of them, He can read books with her, and if he cooks he can get her to help him in the kitchen.  IF she belongs to something like the Girl Scouts have him help her with her badges not just you.  There are a lot of things dad's do with their daughters.  You need to think beyond sports if she's not into them.  Ask him for his help in deciding how to connect to her and see what he has to say.  He may just be waiting for you to ask since he's not her biological father.  He may not want to step on your toes as you're the legal parent.

kZT828wJaa	Economics is not a 'science' in the sense of the physical sciences, however you can win a nobel prize in it, which is something most social sciences can't say.<br>  <br>  As for the economic crisis... it is very complicated, involves a huge varieties of issues and business fields... the main themes are dried up credit markets, a devastated housing market, large bank collapses, and now other companies going down just from the pressure. In the end there will probably be books written about this, and anyone who tells you they understand it, or can pinpoint exactly what has happened (throw in rhetoric from right wing or left wing here) is almost certainly lying. Its a complex issue that has its roots in the last 30 years or so of economic policy, business practices, and consumer habits, as well as many of our institutions, and the way they all interact. You might want to ask about a more specific aspect of the economic crisis to get a more detailed answer from users here.|`|fofzdoROaa	There is a science of macroeconomics but it is not yet popular nor fully developed. The economic crisis was caused for the reasons given below, and by applying the situation at the beginning of the business cycle to a computer program it should be possible to simulate what later takes place. This is science, but so far nobody has achieved this, its hard enough to describe it without being very exact.<br>  <br>  The greed of the land-speculators coupled with that of the banks led to a real-estate bubble which has now burst. The shock of this frightened and caused many savers to pull out their money from the banks, who found that their low amounts of reserves were insufficient, so they either became bankrupt or had to borrow money at high rates of interest. Some could manage to do this and others were forced to sell their investments at low prices, thus the stock-market suffered as prices tumbled. But this also resulted in there being less money being spent on consumption (particularly luxuries) and with the reduction in demand, the manufacturing companies needed less labour and unemployment grew.

ub2F3OKIaa	My girlfriend's 9 year old son has Asperger's.  My interaction with others with this condition seems to be consistent with his behaviors.<br>  <br>  Aspie children require structure.  They tend to take things very literally.  They need CONSTANT reassurance, and have a few interests which consume a lot of their attention (dinosaurs, computers, games, flowers, airplanes, etc).  They can either be quiet and to themselves, or like my girlfriend's son, extremely social.  I'm convinced it is physically impossible for him to be quiet.<br>  <br>  Aspie children that I have observed have a problem with empathy.  They don't understand that other people also have needs, and that the world doesn't revolve around them.  Not their fault, it is just the way their brain is wired.  They also tend to be explosive when they don't get their way, and when overwhelmed, they can have what are called Meltdowns.  Meltdowns are NOT tantrums.  They are their brains way of reacting to too much stimulation.  Mind you, they DO have tantrums like other kids.  They are generally a few years behind in development, but very intelligent.<br>  <br>  They are also extraordinarily picky eaters.  They would rather starve than eat something they don't like.  A lot of this is because they are hypersensitive to texture.<br>  <br>  My girlfriend's son is a great kid.  He tries his best to be funny, he likes to play make-believe, and he can maintain an adult conversation as long as it is something in which he is interested.|`|0l1yibjyaa	Children with Asperger's are all different. As a person who grew up with the condition, I can certainly say there are complications with social interaction. Not all children with Asperger's are friendless and by themselves. With Asperger's we tend to have obscure interests, the main cause for social exclusion. Throughout a person with Asperger's childhood, quite often are they labeled a "nerd" or a "geek" placing them in the same social group as others rejected by peers. Aware of their differences, an Asperger's teen may feel depressed, putting them at greater risk for suicide. Asperger's is a neurological difference, not so much a disability. Children with Asperger's can grow up to be very successful adults with families through counselling. Conflict with teachers is common for children and adolescents without Asperger's. People with Asperger's can have rather odd connections with those much older or younger. To use a personal example, I seem to like socializing with the school psychologist who's 31.|`|dVJ3F6YFaa	Read this article for a full description of the characteristics of Asperger's (it is really too long to write in this answer) <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4723735_autism-aspergers-disorder-quality-evaluation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4723735_autism-a...</a><br>  Yes they can have friends and they do not necessarily argue.  However, because they have difficulty taking other's perpective they can be argumentative because, in their mind, they are right and you are wrong.  They also have a hard time reading social cues and emotional expresion. That also interferes with socialization. However, they are smart and can learn those skills even though they may not come naturally.|`|AA12140689	Each child with Asperger's syndrome is different, so there is no way to describe them all the same. It is very common for children with Asperger's syndrome to have few or no friends. They are socially awkward and often take things literally and get confused with other people. They often do something wrong/inappropriate without realizing that they are not supposed to do it. Many are picky eaters due to sensory issues.<br>  <br>  Those are some examles of what children with Asperger's can be like.|`|QFG0yu24aa	they are pretty normal, but maybe are a bit awkward in social situations and tend to prefer facts to football. <br>  <br>  asperger's is pretty far from full-on autism.

Maybe you're not afraid of him physically, but deep down you know he is capable of hurting you emotionally.  I highly recommend the book "Without Conscience" by Robert D. Hare.

dpFkpqBGaa	The id, ego, and superego make up the human mind. The id acts on the pleasure principle, or focuses on what makes you happy and what you want to do. The superego acts as your conscious against right and wrong or a parental voice. The ego focuses on reality. The ego is realistic and balances out the id and the superego. If you think of the cartoons with the angel and the devil sitting on the character's shoulders, the id is the devil, the superego is the angel, and the ego is the person in the middle.<br>  <br>  The person is then able to try things and not worried about failure.

However, this perception is determined not by ones conscious awareness, but what ones MIND [in some respects what Freud referred to as the "ego"] determines "fits" ones Fate Karma.<br>  <br>  It is ones Fate Karma in concert with ones personality and Apapsyche and MIND cooperatively working together that determines what one thinks, does, and believes.<br>  <br>  To establish an "unconditional positive regard" [a Carl Rogers term] one must discover and eliminate a certain number of repressed fears from within ones MIND realm... and this can occur naturally, but is most effectively achieved by undergoing "competent" psychotherapy.<br>  <br>  Perhaps one in ten thousand licensed professionals today would be capable of facilitating such therapy.<br>  <br>  Please note.... what I have said herein is ture and quite accurate, but do not use it in a class setting because you will be hammered by the teacher who will have no idea what I am saying.<br>  -----------------------<br>  I forgot to mention what happens after such catharsis [name for the discovery and elimination of repressed fears].  Once one awakens to higher levels of reality as a consequence of therapy, one views life differently in that ones tends to see the illusion more clearly and begins to awaken to the Reality of Life more easily.  Life remains the same, but one is more open, more honest, less fearful, and more oriented towards Spirituality.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|lDXh0jRVaa	Do your own homework please.

She knew how to make me a better person, what I could be. How life could be enjoyed.<br>  Composer Richard Rodgers, few men have given so much pleasure to so many people. Even though his songs contributed to other's pleasure, he suffered from chronic depression. He had money and fame,successful in his work, enjoyed a privileged life, and shared two Pulitzer Prizes—but not happiness.Women flocked to him but they didn't give him what he sorely needed.  He didn't just take any, he knew that would be worst.<br>  You know when your zest is gone for people and things.You just know. The hard part is facing what did make you happy.<br>  Recovery-Identify the underlying need, like the one that I didn’t even know I had. To be what I could and should be.  Not the feel good temporary things with people because I  thought I needed that--that is want. Want leaves you.<br>  Once you have identified your underlying need, the next step is to recognize how the people in your life may or may not be fulfilling that need. Look at their words and actions honestly, and answer the question are they fulfilling your need. Or their own. It is possible that others were doing and giving you what you needed once and you simply didn’t take care of it right, because it didn’t follow your movie script of what you wanted them to be, do or accept. <br>  Next, meet that need by communicating.Start talking--that might make all the difference. But be selective.<br>   For me-slowly recognizing what my need really was (not what I wanted it to be)  than following these steps helped. I started with looking at my friends. start seeing them for what they are inside. And of what benefit they are to me in the long run. How good are they to enrich my mind more. And show me true happiness.  Shocking as that sounds your mind and heart are going to be more important in later years than many things except for good healthy friendships. But if your friends are not morally healthy don't expect them to be there later. Make sure you are giving attention to those who will really be there if you need something  Not many has that kind of heart despite the show. That alone can take the spirit out of you. But it's reality. We like to think there is more but that is fantasy.<br>  What's important, what is healthy, who has the values I really wanted, and sticking with them, using my time better, And improving my life more and more.

k2wPknXlaa	Dear Dr. Pepper: I am not trying to be rude or sensational, or even funny... this is just the interpretation that developed as I broke down your dream. i am not usually so wordy...... I really do apologize if you find this offensive!<br>  <br>  Sooo..... This guy you kind of like, we'll call him Luke Warm, pulls you down (down, down down),  to the ground, kind of like your laying down (kind of like having sex).<br>  He said something like...I gotta prove to my friend (he's not even doing what he's trying to do for you!!!! He's doing it to prove something to his friend. He's using you because he thinks you will be an easy lay down.) Then he started spitting in your mouth (Having an orgasm).<br>  You were DISGUSTED (Sometimes the thought of the act of sex seems disgusting to you.). and he says...DUH... What's wrong? So , since you really are a nice person and you don't want to cause a fuss, you take the blame by saying... I've never kissed a boy before!  (Your a virgin)  So.. he begins to take it  easy on you because he realizes you haven't done this before. (He decides that he doesn't have to be so rough (rape you) and that you are going give it  up to him without resistance. Just pecks...(You have only had thoughts about sex.) He takes his time....so he can enjoy your kiss (sex) It turned out that you weren't so disgusted after all. (You liked the sex.) Then it turned out that Nobody really noticed, no big deal after all. (You always thought that having sex for the first time would be a major event, but nowadays nobody really cares because everyone is doing it.) So...the meaning of this is that  subconsciously or in your mind you kind of like Mr. Luke Warm and are wondering what sex would be like with him but you're a virgin and it's not really acceptable for you to have sex yet  because of the way you were brought up. You are also concerned about what people might say if it got around and who might find out.|`|KMMcSMdsaa	jhjh|`|n9KeHcFkaa	i agree you might have secret feelings for him but one time a had a dream similar to that and i ended up liking that guy happens to me a lot.|`|ZfVYb1Szaa	maybe you are afraid to kiss someone on the lips.|`|59UwHzITaa	You obviously have a guy on your mind, right?|`|WttToNwtaa	hahahaha it means you like him.

B94YE68Raa	i'm sorry you had to go through what you had to go through. but it's very unlikely that medical establishments would alter your tests to say that you're normal b/c if there is a real problem, you would have to seek more medical services and those people would make more money off of you. your urine tests came back normal but you still suspect something is wrong. also you say that you have a gastro issue. this isn't enough problems to be diagnosed for it, but it sounds like it might be somatization disorder, where psychological issues get manifested in the body. people with somatization disorder tend to seek lots of tests in a short period of time and get upset and feel distrustful when the tests come back normal. i could be wrong and you might not have this. perhaps the trauma you suffered has drained the trust  out of you. whatever the issues are, i hope things get better for you. good luck.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	become a hippie and live an alternative lifestyle.

You don't need to keep putting yourself through this stress.<br>  The fact that you keep having tests done, just tells me you won't let go.  Listen, people don't lie about normal tests. They have an oath as doctors.<br>  Its no wonder your stomach is upset. Your feelings about the doctors not finding out whats wrong with you, and the misdiagnosis suspicions, and the thoughts of them lying about test results are totally screwing up your stomach.<br>  <br>  I suggest you do not go to any doctors/mental health workers. Read some books, join a club, get out of the house, go do something constructive. You need to get a break from your own mind. The only way to do that is to become so busy with other things....these thoughts don't <br>  have time to creep into your brain and screw with you.<br>  I also think sitting here at the computer is not helping.  I want you to get away from this also.<br>  Just for a while...... I hope you read this a couple of times and let it sink in.

Have any of the people that you have dealt with so far seem like there is a chance you could Trust them?  Can you build something with them?  If not then keep searching for the individual that has that glimmer that you may be able to trust them someday (be sure not to have the wall all the way up) give them some chance instead of shutting down right away, when you find this person have them help you sort through these tests and health concerns, help you either understand why it looks right, what procedures are used to prevent tampering, ect. or if there is some question have them help you locate someone that they would recommend to have the testing done again.  You just need to give them a chance to find out who can be trusted.  As a patient you are ultimately responsible for your own care and need to follow up when you are not satisfied with the answers you are getting, but you also need to be honest with yourself if your questions stem from your paranoia that you know you have or that you still really believe something is wrong.  Good luck, and try to be patient because we can all overcome adversities and injustices we suffer in life if we put our minds to it.|`|srjPOxW7aa	Wow you sound like a perfect combination of two friends of mine. I'm not a doctor (obviously) but I know as far as their mental health goes and the personality disorder. Vit.

Get dis-solvable kind. As far as the establishment goes, I hope someone here can give you a proper answer on that.. I know I didn't answer your question, but I do know that if you take the Vit. B-12 it will help with your personality disorder,( I know it sounds far fetched, but it works) also if you take other vit.s and eat properly and exercise regularly, it will change your whole mind, life&outlook.

Most often than not, weird dreams are a sign of creativity, though.  Something scary like that (and I am assuming it was a nightmare O.o) would mean that you have something on your mind and you need to get rid of it.  It can be totally unrelated to what you experienced in your dream though.<br>  <br>  As a side note, another big reason we have dreams of silly things is because the TV or radio is left on while asleep.  A brief visualization may occur of what was on TV or on the radio.  This could also happen if you happened to remember something similar on a TV show earlier on.  Hope that helps!

It has many MANY doors, which all lead to different rooms. It's a lot like a mantion, except the inside is larger than the outside. From the outside you see a wonderful garden and the front has greek columns. Now there is a main room, that you first enter and its kinda large. There is a even number of various doors equally on the left and right. They are all different, and are for different things, they each open up to a large room. They all represent things such as, knowledge, emotion, memories, ect. They each contain doors to specific things, like say in the emotion room there is the door to anger. Each room has many doors, by the way. Now in the main room there is marble flooring and a large elegant staircase at the end of the hallway. There is a red carpet that goes down the stairs. In this house there are 20 floors, which does not appear that way from the outside either. Now if you go up the stairs you will be on the third floor, I don't know why but it skips the second floor. This is a rather large control room, with a long table that has chairs in it. These are usually occupied by the residence of the mation, which all look alike to me but not excatly like me. They usually hold an open conference here and have many memebers. There is a display in the front of the room that shows anything they want, such as vision, thoughts, ect. There is an elevator at the end, which looks normal but has no buttons. It knows where you are and where you are going the moment you enter so it does not need the buttons. The door to the elevator is different on every floor and looks like an old wooden door. Now I could go on about these things, but I must warn you about one thing. There is basically an infinate amount of rooms, and they may distort your view of reality. They can be dangerous, such as fear. In that room you would probably see a TON of black widows seeing as thoes are my fear, but these can not kill you. You will fully experience everything but will never die due to the fact of my imagination. It is a very decieving place, and even though it may seem like all fun and games, it can be much worse than meets the eye. Another example would be privacy, which you would be yelled at for entering, and would not be able to see for the lights are always off in the room. The house will distort reality and I suggest to anyone if they would enter in, that they listen to the inhabitance of the house. They are wise, and can help you and keep you safe.

Ruifi0GSaa	Hi,<br>  When you dream that you are pregnant, it don't really mean you are.<br>  Just means that you are about to give birth to something new in your life, something that needs lots of care and attention in order to reach its full potential.<br>  Hope that helps, happy dreams to you :)
ev9cOp5Vaa	Common dream scenarios include having your teeth crumble in your hands, fall out one by one with just a light tap, grow crooked or rot. Such dreams are not only horrifying and shocking, but often leaves the dreamer with a lasting image of the dream. So what does it mean?<br>  <br>         <br>  One theory is that dreams about your teeth reflect your anxiety about your appearance and how others perceive you. Sadly, we live in a world where good looks are valued highly and your teeth play an important role in conveying that image. Teeth are used in the game of flirtations, whether it be a dazzling and gleaming smile or affectionate necking. These dreams may stem from a fear of your sexual impotence or the consequences of getting old. Teeth are an important feature of our attractiveness and presentation to others. Everybody worries about how they appear to others. Caring about our appearance is natural and healthy.<br>  <br>  Another rationalization for these falling teeth dream may be rooted in your fear of being embarrassed or making a fool of yourself in some specific situation. These dreams are an over-exaggeration of your worries and anxiety.?<br>  <br>         Teeth are used to bite, tear, chew and gnaw. In this regard, teeth represent power. And the loss of teeth in your dream may be from a sense of powerlessness. Are you lacking power in some current situation? Perhaps you are having difficulties expressing yourself or getting your point across. You feel frustrated when your voice is not being heard. You may be experiencing feelings of inferiority and a lack of self-confidence in some situation or relationship in your life. This dream is an indication that you need to be more assertive and believe in the value of your own opinion.<br>  <br>  Then again, This pressure may also mean that you have actual dental pain!

They are not very smart though. They would rather paint and draw the whole day neglecting everything they need to do. Why is that? It is because they love it and their obsessed.   <br>  <br>  Drawing has no collation with how intelligent you are. You control how intelligent you are.<br>  <br>  I draw stick figures, but I'm pretty intelligent. Steve Jobs, the crater of Apple can't draw for beans and some consider him a genius.

VgWJ8yvwaa	There can be millions of reasons. One that comes to mind first would be that she is afraid of herself or thinks her opinion doesn`t matter. She is still very small and therefore there is still much time for her to build her own character. I would suggest talking openly to her about it. When she does it again, talk to the puppet and ask her why doesn`t her owner talk instead. It may only be shyness but if it is left as it is it may develop into a more serious problem. It would be logical to assume that she expresses opinions she herself cannot and therefore I think she should be shown enough attention and be listened to whenever she has something to say because that is the best way to show her her opinion matters. Don`t be afraid to spoil her because even if that happens it is an issue that is much easier to deal with than something like this. If you don`t see any change then you should maybe consider professional help but do not seek it unless it happens to be completely necessary. I wish you luck|`|3y9AlP6Raa	She most likely thinks it`s funny!<br>  Don`t worry things will change......just as soon as she realises that in order to talk she has to stick her nose up.......!<br>  Let her schoolfriends deal with it.<br>  .....but keep an eye on her

1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Sounds very much like it's related to her father issues. Most girls who grow up without a father figure in the home act out in some way around the dating age. They are very needy of male attention & seem to latch on to it when it's given.|`|03e1b22ff05e6b64805763f168df8f5baa	definitely|`|ZJ4IQP5iaa	Well, I'm a guy (I'm 18), but I'm going through almost the exact same thing of what's going on with the girl mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I go for weeks sometimes without talking to my father. He's not a REALLY terrible guy, but I don't like him. He's never been fatherly toward me.<br>  <br>  He usually gets home from work, does some work out in his garage, does some other stuff, and then watches TV the rest of the night. <br>  <br>  I don't avoid him everyday because of this stuff though. I stay away from him because he has the shortest and most nonsensical temper I know. <br>  <br>  Say he didn't like the food my mother made us for supper. Maybe the potatoes were a little dry, or the spaghetti a little overcooked. He won't say anything about it, though; he'll take his dish and THROW it into the sink or in the garbage. He usually makes a rather large mess. <br>  <br>  One small dog hair in his food? He gets pissed. I can understand that. What I can't understand is why he throws the food onto the wall over the sink. Can't he get a new plate of food?<br>  <br>  And then he sulks. If he has a bad day, or anything goes wrong, he acts like he's the only one affected and childishly argues with my mother, then goes off to watch TV.<br>  <br>  My mother wants a divorce (she hasn't said anything to him, and probably won't), but where would she--and we, her three children--go? <br>  <br>  Sorry, but I seem to have gotten off track. I guess I needed to vent.<br>  <br>  My point is that my father ignores me (and I ignore him). I believe that this is why I don't communicate well with older guys. I don't talk to my Uncles or other guys over 30. I just can't. I feel as though I'm failing them in some way, like I don't measure up to their standards. <br>  <br>  I was raised by my mom, my aunts, my 15 or so female cousins, and my sisters. I seek female friends over male friendship. I don't participate in sports--I'm very bookish.<br>  <br>  Maybe I don't trust myself to open up more to older guys. I believe that my father is at fault.<br>  <br>  I've never actually met someone who acts as a father-figure towards me. Maybe if I did I would obsessively cling to them, too.<br>  <br>  Not having a father--or a father who doesn't do anything with you--will in most cases make someone cling to fatherly figures or just male friends.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	Yes, it could come from not having a father in their lives.  You should look for acceptance from men in another way.  Find a male mentor who's older than you and work through your issues with him or find a therapist to talk to for a while while you work through those issues.  You might end up with the wrong person with out realizing it because you're trying to fit a need.

WQWA7L5zaa	You thought they were pretty cool and now you know them better and you realize they are not so they cannot be your friends after all. Deal with it.<br>  <br>  You can't reason with them, all you can do is let time work its wonders so they'll have to eat their words some day, and in the meantime you don't have any time to waste with them. Go look for some people that you are comfortable with, and these ones you can call your friends.<br>  <br>  It's quite normal to make mistakes about people, especially when one is young. Just don't get heart-sick and next time, before placing all your hopes in some new person or group you've just met, remember this experience and be careful not to make the same mistake.|`|14dc5a2caf80531c380c037d989d53edaa	A couple reasons, well, no there is only one actual reason for being arrogant, and that is fear.  The degree to which one acts out with intellectualism is in direct proportion to the amount of fear being repressed within that person's MIND.<br>  <br>  Ones MIND holds ones attention in ones Left-Hemisphere and in thinking much of the time in order to "protect" that person from becoming aware of the intense fears being repressed within that person's MIND.<br>  <br>  How to deal with such people?  Unfortunately one cannot do so.  The reason is that the person's MIND feeds Delusional Thinking or D-Think to the Left-Hemisphere of his/her brain that causes that person to "think" that what he/she "thinks" is true.... and there is no way to dissuade such people that they are wrong because a primary fear they have is of being "wrong".<br>  <br>  Find new friends that think less and intuit more.<br>  <br>  Peace|`|1TrRrWMLaa	The only way is to deal with this is to show him where he is wrong and back it up with proof. If the topic is subjective is anyway he can argue the idea that he is correct. So you have to show him how he is wrong. The thing is you have to do so in a polite way so you do not upset him. Most people who act like this do so because they are sensitive to being wrong. Good luck.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Arrogance stems from insecurity.|`|7c007d90b52d84105c8a22e166229b79aa	You are being arrogant.|`|heXiCKepaa	Walk away.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	It's not easy to be around those kinds of people. My Dad & brother are sort of like that and it drives me crazy & makes me angry too at times. Try to get him on a topic that you are well versed in while in conversation. If they try to tell you something you know for a fact is wrong, then tell them how & why you know they're wrong. That can be humbling to them.Also, it may come down to having to just say, man, you're my friend but this know it all crap has got to stop. Tell him to give someone else a chance to give their opinion every now & then. If it continues to worsen & he can't get the clue, then you may have to stop hanging out with him. People like that can cause others to put you in the same category.|`|n9KeHcFkaa	just ignore them and whenever they act like that towards you just say God bless and have a nice day then walk away...yea i know it seems weird but I guarantee you they won't say anything else after that..since its your friend he will probably ask why you said something so weird just tell them I didn't want to say anything mean because of the way you were acting|`|yr0UZVZAaa	If they ever say that they do know it all, ask them or tell them a paradox. Something like "Really? Everything? Well is the answer to this question no?"<br>  It sounds however they only seem to you personally arrogant, even though they may have never done anything.|`|nTn3Crneaa	Ignore him/her. OR if you are brave enough, confront them. However, that may lead to a fight which may lead to a break up in the friendship. But that shoulden't be that much of a big deal since they aren't the best of friends you have had.

You can't say the best doctor, because everyone has different criteria for what makes a doctor the best, you can't say the best teacher because that varies from person to person.

Sure, not THE RICHEST, but rich is rich. I don't think there's any value in being the richest person in the world, really. You already have far more than enough to live on.<br>  <br>  As for other professions, being 'best' is a totally subjective thing. The best cook cant be judged objectively - youre talking about literal 'taste.' And the same goes for, I dunno, best doctor, best physicist. Do you count Newton as the best physicist, or Marie Curie? Marie Curie won two Nobel prizes, after all, and was the first person (not woman, person) to ever do so for her work on radioactivity.<br>  <br>  The reason we often associate men with being 'the best' or lead figures, is that education teaches us largely about the past. Even sciences and suchlike will teach you mainly past achievements, rather than m,ore modern ones, and in the past women were refused education, and there was no artificial birth control so if a woman was married (which most were) she would be bringing up children for most of her life.<br>  <br>  Anyway, professions where women are debatably the best: social work, health (GPs/pharmacists/specialists,) teaching/lecturing, media, literature (novelists/journalists/poets,) classical music, film/tv/stage/radio acting... the list goes on.

mjhPteRYaa	It is entirely possible to have dreams that are prophetic announcements of a literal pregnancy. Hormones may kick in or the all-knowing unconscious may make us aware of what is going on in our bodies via a dream well before we see the evidence in waking life's blue line on a store bought strip.<br>   <br>  As always, question your dream noticing the finer details. How far along are you? Are you showing? Are you close to delivery? Are you actually giving birth? If you've delivered, are you taking care of the child? <br>  <br>  If you are not showing, but know you are pregnant, think of this symbolically and ask yourself if there is some idea that you've conceived but are not 'showing' to the world? Is there something hidden inside you, waiting to be noticed, waiting to be given some attention and time to develop? <br>  <br>  If you are close to delivery, this usually means that something you've been planning or thinking about is close to materializing in the waking world. <br>  <br>  If you are giving birth, think about what happens when a woman gives birth: there is pain, followed by new life. In this case, this could indicate something in your life that will be painful to deal with but will ultimately give you great joy. Or it could mean that there is something you want to bring into the world which will be as life changing as giving birth. Whatever it is, the good news is that it is a natural event, something spontaneous and filled with life. <br>  <br>  If you have already given birth, are you taking care of what you brought into the world or has it been abandoned? Look at your life and see if there is something that needs some nurturing, some part of yourself that means a lot to you, but you haven't been taking care of--a project, a relationship, anything. Ask yourself why this isn't being addressed, ask yourself what is more important that your own creation. <br>  <br>  Another type of pregnancy dream involves abortion or miscarriage. These dreams all point to something being unfulfilled--a wish, a hope, a desire or even a special project. Dreams of unfulfilled pregnancy are pleas from our psyche to look at what we want to bring into the world and examine why we aren't doing it. <br>  <br>  Pregnancy dreams, like real life pregnancies are harbingers of change, creativity, and new life being brought into the world. Treat your life as you would treat yourself if you were pregnant and wait for the miracle you're already creating to manifest in your waking world!|`|CoRGsuN3aa	Maybe you just have a big imagination.

It would be distracting, make it hard to concentrate on studies.|`|JbbfVyVGaa	yes. if they are lower class (sounds rude i know) or their parents constantly fight, then they will want to "escape" if you will. they dont want to be in that environment so they dont do their hw and probably hang out with friends till late at night. sometimes the kids in upper class don't do hw cuz they think their parents will give them everything in life. they also might have parents that are divorced (not to say other classes dont but a lot of times people marry people with money for money) so they are torn between 2 parents, often switching houses every week or weekend. i know 1 girl who spends every other week with her dad and she likes being with her mom more because her moms richer and gives her whatever shes asks for. those kids are also likly to use drugs & alchol cuz they have the money. kids in lower classes try to run away from their probs with alchol and drugs and middle class kids think they could never do better or worse so they use the 2. kids with parent(s) with addiction are more likely to get addicted. this leads to failure to do schoolwork.|`|B94YE68Raa	yes definitely. if the student has to work to help their family make ends meet on top of school, they wouldn't have much time. but that's no excuse for not doing your hw. regardless of the situation, teachers will grade the work the same as any other student's. life is unfair sometimes but we gotta find ways to make things work.|`|hQQoFG5kaa	i think financially everyone would function a lot better if they had no worries holding them down. when you have something anything on your mind it clogs your mind from learning and doing what you need to do. this day in age it is getting more difficult to focus especially with a lot more distractions around us.

D0JsiC0Paa	It is paraphanilia, that is, it deviates considerably from what conventional systems agree to be within normal predetermined and objectively measured paramaters; such parameters don't exist of course and as long a single criteria, that is the most important one, is fulfilled - then there isn't a problem and that is that it is always mutual. Then it can just be branded as a preferance. It's the idea of the different criteria for abnormality; statistical infrequency, deviation from social norms and maladaptive or self-destructive behaviour - this fulfills all three of course but that just demonstrates the weakness of the scale; because people who box can be said to be engaging in self-destructive behaviour, the same for extreme sports - but to stop them would be to severely impeach upon their civil liberties and so 'if it feels good, do it' - personal prefence as far as I'm concerned; just like someone gagging themselves for a better orgasm. Unless the person voices personal distress and wants to be helped or if it infringes upon the freedoms of others; it is not treated as either.|`|AA11789493	My opinion is just that, an opinion, with no basis to back it up.  I think it is a form of self-punishment for something the person is suppressing because they feel they are to blame for something unhealthy sexually that happened to them in an earlier life.  The person should start therapy and bring it to the surface of their conscious thought.  If it's proven there is no self-punishment, then I say, ". . . whatever floats your boat."  However, there may come a time when you end up killed by your search for the ultimate sexual pleasure.  Like taking strangulation too far.|`|m89kGXBnaa	It's debateable (and debated) as with all many of the paraphanalias... as it doesn't cause distress, it's unusual sure and outside of the norm, but alone this are not sufficient to be considered a disorder (homosexuality is outside statistically less common, often outside social norms and in no way a disorder, for example).<br>  <br>  It doesn't tend to be treated as a disorder unless the person wants it to be, basically. Or unless it becomes out of control/compulsive. Much like other fetishes|`|8jKzMOboaa	Its both.And like any other act for sexual gratification there are almost 100 different answers from 100 different people. Ones who seek treatment that feel its a disorder there is help,when others don't see any problem.

D0JsiC0Paa	Totally normal - family troubles can be awfully traumatic and I'm sorry but it's a fact of life that some things beyond ourselves and our control can affect us badly; the important thing is to stick it out, make sure you have good friends to get you through the period until you have siezed a little independence in your own life. That's not to say you just sit and ride out the storm - I understand any official therapy might make things worse at home and that's fine and fair - but talk to a school counsellor at least on a regular basis, it won't cost you anything, no one will know anything unless there's abuse going on at home and you can get it off your chest - that is what friends are for too - every little bit helps and adds to the whole.|`|BkatcMZbaa	It is an over reaction by you in such a situation normally after a bad experience or after a serious sickness.   You need to train up yourself to withstand it as a normal happening and you will calm down.  Keep on practising the skill to perfection......even the specialist will give that advice because you only can do it.  Give it a try and slowly you will change for the better if not so good but can control by YOU.  Remember YOU.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Not weird at all. I grew up in a house where my parents argued constantly & often would take it out on us kids as well. I remember feeling sick to my stomach if I saw my Dad's car in the driveway when I came home. My Mom was bipolar so I never knew which personality was going to meet me at the door each day. It's a very stressful environment for kids & teenagers to grow up in. Maybe you could talk to one of them (whichever u r closest to) & tell them that the constant arguing is making you very nervous. Also, you can try headphones to drown them out & listen to your favorite music. Try to relax some & know that it isn't your fault, you just happen to have to live with it.

wdqZNhL4aa	Simply put, a therapist is someone that is legally able to preform therapy. They may have a degree in social work, psychology, counseling, or marriage and family therapy (and possibly some others). You will find some in each area that will help and some in each area that might not help.  Each state will have different qualifications for a person that is able to do therapy.|`|2hAuIg5baa	a psycologist will talk to you and give you advice and help you trough your problems<br>  a therapist will sit and nod there head and repeat 'how does that make you feel' over and over again!|`|qPj7p6D1aa	Either if they are trained in therapeutics. A psychologist is more likely going to diagnose a problem and give this to the therapist to generate a source of recovery. Or we may just go to a counselor whom doesn't provide any diagnoses and offers a compassionate understanding.|`|m89kGXBnaa	A therapist is a psychologist,<br>  <br>  A therapist is an applied (or clinical) psychologist, rather than a research psychologist, organisational psychologist, etc.<br>  <br>  There are different types of therapy therefore different psychotherapists or clinical psychologists; CBT, RET etc. There's also counsellors, who do couselling. Psychiatrists are different in that they did a medical not a psychological degree and can prescribe drugs but may also do therapy.<br>  <br>  Not all psychologists will be practising or clinical - helping people with disorders.
AA12360662	Dreaming of love or close one dies could serve as symbol of better and more communication.<br>  <br>  In your case, dreaming of best friend may reflect some helplessness in you. In other words, you are seeking for more support from her.  Seeing her death basically reflect the low confidence in you about losing support.  You may be feeling lost or lack of confidence in some way recently.  And that is why you release the feeling in this dream.|`|uxwSd0KLaa	In real life your friend will not die ; but your relation will die in the future|`|YonedWiEaa	your dream suggests that you know something that your friend is doing in real life that is dangerous and doesn't want anyone in the school(teachers) to find out.|`|AA12035254	usually when people dream of someone close dying, its symbolic of the end of an era with that person - for example, some parents dream of their children dying when they begin primary school. its not that they want their child to die, simply that a period of time - the preschool years, have now 'died off'.<br>  <br>  so in the case of your friend, it could be that you've moved onto a new stage in the friendship, or perhaps one of you has got a new friend or boyfriend and the other is feeling slightly left out?<br>  <br>  this dream simply means you're passing from one stage to another, and the death is not of the person, but of the previous stage in the relationship with that person.|`|5QxIsPBbaa	it means that if she actually died like in ur dream, u would regret things like be mean to her. so the dream is sayin that u should treat her like it would be the last time u see her...
iUzSlmSbaa	He or she will ask you questions. Try to be honest. It's important that you build up a level of trust between the councellor and yourself, your therapist wants to help you to cope with your problems, so if you are asked how you feel, you should just honestly say how you feel, and about what worries you about ''diseases''' that this gives you a lot of concern to think about ''diseases''.. It will be a dialogue.. your therapist will ask you and you should be as honest as you can to get the help you need so that you can feel better soon.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	I know what it's like to try and explain things to someone you dont' know well.  This is what I do especially when I was your age I would right down the things that I was dealing with and give it to the therapist to read.  That would give them an idea of what was needed and it helped them and me to start to feel comfortable around each other.  It takes a minute for people to process the information you're read which means that the theapist is less likely to come out with a answer with out thinking about it first.|`|qPj7p6D1aa	If you actually need something to talk about with the therapist then you don't need to be there. And what i'm saying is that the problem is that you have forgotten or more evenly repressed some material which ought to have been shared. We all provoke our understandings until a critical point appears and we soon develop a diagnosis of common anxiety or a periodic depression. The counselor is there to guide you thru a jumble-like bunch of repressed and regressed events and the rest is for your adventure and a feeling of accomplishment.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Start with just trying to describe some of the feelings you are having. The therapist should ask you questions to sort of guide you along & help make it easier to open up. I also found that it got a bit easier each time I went. They are not there to judge you, they are there for you to listen to you & help you. At first I found it hard to know where to start because there was so much going on, so I started with the thing that bothered me the most. Try that. I wish you luck & hope you feel better soon.|`|AA10501503	Hey.  I've been to therapy.  it's weird, anxiety ridden and you never know what the heck to say to them.  It's uncomfortable...but start by telling them that.  Explain how uncomfortable you are and how anxious you are about the situation.  Try to explain why, what's going on in your head that causes you the anxiety about the situation.  If s/he's a good counselor, they will work off of this.  often, you just need time.  Hopefully you aren't being limited by an insurance company or lack of proper funds for this and can go until things are resolved as much as possible.  Just go slow and try to work things out.  It took me a bunch of sessions to get relaxed enough to say anything I thought was of value, but as I look back now and having taken quite a few psychology courses (I'm a psych major), I've seen that even what was said in the first few sessions was important info that she used to help me.  Go slow, keep at it, and just keep going no matter how anxious you are.

If the problem is a teenager constantly getting into trouble, and nothing else seems to be working, then the solution is the United States militarty. <br>  <br>  The teen needs discipline. "Teen boot camp" is not the same. Boot camp is an alternative to being incarcerated.

D0JsiC0Paa	Well, Ghandi did say that 'A nation can be judged on how civilized it is by how it treats its animals' - so there must be something to it, but I don't think the link is specific to animals; it's the bond that most juveniles lack that is fulfilled; caring for an animal brings some sort of stability, unconditional love that only an animal can give and a sense of responsibility and purpose. Some of them have never been trusted to take care of anything in their lives, that alone can be overwhelming.|`|B94YE68Raa	quite possibly since they'll be devoting their time taking care of the animals as opposed to being idle and on the streets.

VgWJ8yvwaa	Yes, this definitely isn`t an easy question to answer. The primary meaning I give to faulty thinking is the logical one. Any train of thought has to obey certain rules of logic, e.g. if A is true then not-A is false. etc. Unfortunately, thinking is something very different from some logical system because we base our thinking on many things which aren`t connected to facts and/or reason and there is no way to create a set of rules which would guide us to think "in a rightful way". There are many things you have to take into consideration and these things differ from one individual to another. Some of these are moral obligations, life priorities, life philosophies, experience, character, reason, feelings, etc. However, if you are only talking of facts then the answer is most easily found if you follow the rules of Logic|`|2hAuIg5baa	elaborate?|`|cfj0RJLTaa	Well by faulty thinking, what do you mean? <br>  On the other hand, you could always measure the pros and cons of the thinking. You need to make your own criteria for what you think "faulty" thinking is and then learn how to follow these guidelines you set yourself, and identify "faulty" thinking. For example, you can base it on your morals or any morals of right and wrong.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps since I didn't fully understand your question(:

If you dream in alternate media on an occasional basis, then most likely it means that you have a very active imagination and that you watch a lot of those types of programs on television or on the computer.  I imagine I wouldn't be going to far if I guessed that when you were younger you went through a "Wallace and Grommet," phase where you watched that Brer Rabbit movie over and over.  If you are an artist and you spend a lot of time with those media then that would reinforce the hypothesis above and there's nothing at all unusual about what you're describing.  Seperations from reality are quite common in the dream state.

No one wants to put their money into shares since no one knows when the share market will reach the bottom.

4c03ca2af0670791eae96802dcc67d06aa	Manny was trying to tell you that he knew he was dying and not to be afraid.  He's still there.  He will always be there, as long as you remember him...and I know you will.  Think about this.  Nothing is forever.  You will see him again someday.  The fact that you saw him in white clothes and everything says that he is better now.  He has a fully-working body and is healthier than ever.  He is going to live with God and is waiting for you.  He just wants you to be happy, which means that you have a truly remarkable friend who thought of you even though he knew he was dying.<br>  <br>  I believe that the second dream was you seeing what happened to him because his step dad told you that his mom took him off the machine.  Although you tried so hard to reach him and save him but couldn't is normal.  You were only a witness to it.  The two guys holding you back and keeping you from saving your friend indicated that you are not to blame.  There was nothing you could have done.  You can't change what happened.  You just have to accept it and move on.  I know what it's like.  I had to do the same when my grandmother passed away.  I tried to go see her too, but my parents wouldn't let me.  I was pregnant at the time, and my mom was paranoid that I would end up getting sick and that it would affect the baby.  I begged and begged, but they wouldn't let me go.  It was Friday when they went.  They finally said I could go on Sunday.  I cried and cried, and I wrote down, "I hate this.  They won't let me go until Sunday, but she won't be there then."  I don't know how, but I knew she wouldn't be there.  At 1:00 am, we got a call that she had passed away.  I still cry a lot because I miss her, especially when I hear Christina Aguilera's song, Hurt.  I told you this because I want you to realize that loss is something that everyone eventually has to deal with.  I know it's not fair to have to deal with it at such a young age, but it happens.  I just want you to take comfort in the fact that Manny is better now, and he misses you just as much as you miss him.  One day, you two will meet again and be able to embrace one another in the best hug you've ever experienced.  Trust me.  God is watching over him and will always be there to comfort you.<br>  <br>  Also, don't feel badly about not being able to make it there to say good-bye.  You were actually blessed.  You received the blessing of having your friend reach out to you in your dream just before he passed away.  That was his way of saying good-bye to you and helping you to cope with his death by showing you that he is in a better place now.  You did get to say good-bye, even if those weren't the words that were said.<br>  <br>  He knows you miss him.  You had a great friendship.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  God bless!|`|LPArdQtbaa	what i think about first dream is that that was him. there are lots of stories like that. ppl like seeing their son in war, ya know. so i believe that's him<br>  <br>  second dream. i said this a lot of times on other dream things. i read somewhere that dreams are ur brain making up stories while you sleep. but, the story is like part real life. so for example if u like think of playing football before u sleep or u play football for a long time in that day, you might dream about makin a touchdown, bein in superbowl ect... so u thought of manna b4 u slept??|`|C5a4QHgdaa	Sometimes people have dreams that they can't explain.<br>  I think your best friend might be getting in your dreams. Don't be freaked, just go with it.<br>  <br>  You miss him, and even though its hard, time heals.|`|FsVZCk0laa	Oh man. That's a very sad story. I'm sorry about your loss.<br>  <br>  I had dreams like this when my best friend passed away on 2/14/08. It's just the greiving process at work. I would suggest telling your folks about all of this, and they will help you. Go talk to a professional, because a shrink would really be able to help you. But your dreams just symbolize that you miss him, and you're very traumatized about his death. It will one day pass, and even though it will be hard to get passed, you will one day not think about it all the time. It would be another month, year, or 5 years... it will just take time. "Time heals all wounds." <br>  But go talk to a shrink because if you keep all of your emotions bottled up like this, you might do something bad, or commit suicide. And talking to a shrink will unleash your real feelings and make it a little less stressful.<br>  <br>  Think about the good times you had with him, not the bad last minutes.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the "about 2 weeks after his death his step dad told me that his mom took him off the machines for the money which i completely think is true but hey i wasnt there. but i do got things to prove it, all she wanted was the money. but whatever."<br>  Keeping someone alive using all of the systems they had to use (I.V., bed costs, breathing tubes, 24/7 watch) get's very, very expensive. Even with the best insurance, it would still cost a whole lot. The family might of ran out of money, and if they continued to keep him alive, they might of gotten so poor they wouldn't be able to make the payments. And if 'Lil Pit' was showing no true signs of getting better, well, chances are he won't. Cystic Fibrosis is a traumatic disease.<br>  <br>  Once again, I'm sorry for your loss. My best wishes go out to you.|`|oWYevEPtaa	What I got from your dream is that your subconscious feels guilty for not making it on time to say goodbye.  <br>  <br>  I've gone through the same thing you have, just under different circumstances.  His death is fairly recent, so you are most likely still in the angry period.  You are angry that he died and you are trying to blame someone for his death because it isn't fair.  Soon, you'll realize that there was nothing anyone could do to help him.  He was very sick and he was probably in so much pain that he was ready to go.  I know he would have wanted to say goodbye to you, but sometimes, things don't go as they're planned.  You are allowed to cry.  Cry all you want.  Just make sure that you try your hardest to move on.  Think of the good times you had and remember that he would want you to be happy.  He wouldn't want you to dwell on his death forever.<br>  <br>  I know it's easier said than done, but it will get easier, I promise.  You will be able to live your life again.
kVLZTeQraa	I'm sorry for your loss.<br>  I think you should respect his grandmother's wishes and keep the ring, unless there ever becomes another person in his family who it would have been passed on to had he not done so, in which case you could offer it to them. <br>  Whether or not you wear is it entirely dependant on how you feel. If you're uncomfortable about wearing it then don't force yourself to, that might just lead to more grief.|`|WQWA7L5zaa	This may look like a very down-to-earth answer, but diamonds are a valuable commodity and you might need to get some cash at some point in the future so keep the ring. <br>  <br>  The diamonds are probably different sizes and you could sell them one at a time and get more money this way than if you sold the ring in one piece. But I'm no expert so check it out. Just consider the ring like your nest-egg. <br>  <br>  Get an education on the value of diamonds, get them appraised individually BEFORE you need to sell so when the time comes (because considering the economy it probably will come) you will not be in a panic and sell to the first low-ball offer.|`|DunU13FNaa	I would wear the ring in honor of  his memory.<br>  Wear it on a different finger that is not associated with being engaged. Or you could wear it on a chain.<br>  Or you could just keep it in a special place, so when you look at it you would be reminded of  him and the happy memories you had together.<br>  He will always be a part of your life, be proud of that by wearing the ring.  <br>  I'm sure his mother and father and grandmother would want you to.|`|hQQoFG5kaa	first i want to say sorry for your loss, i know how it feels to loss someone you really care about i lost my good friend/ ex boyfriend about 6 years ago. if i were you since you tried returning the ring already and they have made it clear to you that you should keep it. then keep it for now they obviously see you as family already and want you to have it because he would want you to have it.

AA12360662	Many people may think that you are still missing her.  However, dreaming of love ones especially grand parents could symbolize some respect you are looking for in reality.<br>  <br>  In other words, you may have a close relationship with her.

T11AOlenaa	This is very, very, very, VERY normal, especially considering that your family member had a stroke. I think about this stuff all the time, but I would never do it, just sort of a, "what if?" sort of thinking. <br>  However, if you ever feel seriously suicidal, you should talk to someone like a school counselor, and just remember that life is all you know, and that you should live it up until you die for reasons other than your own.<br>  I wish the best to you and your family.
D0JsiC0Paa	She may have been disgusted at her sexual promiscuity or thought that the girl didn't have much respect for herself.<br>  <br>   It could be because she just doesn't like the girl - girl politics are deep and b*tchy.<br>  <br>   It could be that she likes the guy and is jealous, because when a girl gets her butt smacked she wants it to sting because that's what feels good and she could be jealous.<br>  <br>   Unless you have other evidence, I'm guessing she just thought the other girl was a skank.|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	Probably jeaously or envy.

D0JsiC0Paa	Because when told not to do something or think about something, there is a system in our minds keeping track of whether we are thinking about it or not, to try and not think about it creates a processing paradox making us think about it more and make it a compulsive obsession or need to perform the act for relief; and so it is the natural order of things that those susceptible and lacking in control do things when told not to do them.

The key is humbly carrying your own weight.  Not seeking special compensation for just following through with what you decided to do.<br>  <br>  -----------------<br>  Though, it's quite possible that we live in a world that stupidity and failure have become normal and acceptable.  So that success is something special and does deserve a reward other than the success itself?  <br>  <br>  Certainly not how I was raised, but this may be the case.<br>  <br>  Just look at the octomom.

Whenever they do, they predictably 'forget' to mention that it is women's choices that cause the vast, vast majority of the wage gap.<br>  <br>  The Independent Women's Forum (antifeminist women's group) took a 'study' by feminists and applied all the various factors (hours, overtime, loyalty, etc.) and deduced from it that women who put in as much effort actually earn 98% of hwat men earn.<br>  <br>  Sure - that's bad that a 2% difference exists, but it is not the 24% claim that feminists fraudulently make claim to. Harriet Harman (a feminist PM in British Government) has recently start waffling on that women only earn 40% of what men earn. However, she 'forgets' to mention (though she did the first time she gave mention of it- but hasn't since) that she is comparing p/t women to f/t men. Clearly she is acting in a fraudulent manner.<br>  <br>  <br>  NOW, if we go with the 40% or even the 24% claims that feminists make, and force companies to pay 100% - then women would be compensated for their own choices.<br>  <br>  The point that ksoileau is bringing to attention, is that people find it unfair to compensate men for their own choices - so why should we compensate women for their own choices?<br>  <br>  Now if you want 'equality' and promote the not-so-honest issue of the wage gap, then you will surely agree with ksoileau's (hypothetical) perspective and insist that men should be compensated.<br>  <br>  If you don't want equality - then you will argue in favour of the wage gap - but call out ksoileau for demanding special rights for a man's own choices.<br>  <br>  And this question does which?<br>  <br>  Ahuh.<br>  <br>  <br>  He has proven that feminism is not about equality.|`|rFlhIgJXaa	People expect compensation because we are lazy.

I will like to add.. (because i see this so often, that the stay at home mom isnt a job) in reality it is a JOB. Every day waking up to take care of children... Cleaning the house at all times...cooking dinner..doing laundry.. running arrons. isnt that kinda like a babysitter, secretary, maid, ect all in one. you see.. if she does that every day of the week.. sorry but that is WORK to me..

piE8mQM3aa	Well, I've walked away from many "friendships" for that reason - because I've felt I've put in more than I've gotten back (not saying I EXPECT much, just that I think it's wrong to be friends with people on THEIR terms, not OUR terms, you know?) It should DEFINITELY be 50/50.<br>  <br>  I'm 25 and my oldest friend I have is from the 7th grade? Maybe a year older? She will be my friend until I die and vice versa. I've been through.. I can't even say how much and she's the one who's been there for me more than anyone in my life. If she was a man, I'd want to get married to her HAHA. I'm totally blessed she's my friend. But I can honestly say with everything I've been through with friends it's so much easier giving up "friends" with the crap they have put me through.|`|b412254e11519aaa92cbe9efe511c454aa	You probably don't really walk away, but instead, do a lot less walking toward a person. You don't need to do it, it happens on it's own, Pretty soon instead of spending time or trying to put time into a friendship, you find you'd rather take a walk alone, read a book, spend time with someone a little bit more reciprocal to your friendship or (anything you want) instead of doing what ever you might have usually done with them.  If you've generally put more into a relationship, find it disappointing, try harder and then and break it off with an abrupt yank, you'll have all the 'hurt looks' by your self. Don't rush to make a statement or burn a bridge any too soon. Let nature take its course and over time, the message will come through, and you'll have done it with poise and grace.  And you might end up with a situation with this person that's better but different than you ever thought.|`|vKmHODEhaa	60% 40% is the max for me|`|4B9Ve1LSaa	A friendship should not have a tally, however if you find yourself always giving giving and more giving and feel taken advantage of you should   re-evaluate your relationship.  A friendship is not meant to be so difficult and one-sided.  If the two of you have been friends for a long time it is at least worth having a talk with them, good friends are hard to come by.  If your friend is non-responsive or overly defensive regarding the subject, give em the boot.  Life is hard enough you don't need another person to make it any harder.  Good luck to you.<br>  BTW, oldest friendship 15 yrs.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Well I don't put friendships on a 50/50 ratio.  Being a friend is give and take, so somedays we may be even, and other days my friend may dominate the conversation.  I guess where I draw the line is on whether it is a friendship.  An example is a girl my husband went to college with.  She would stop by our house uninvited, stay for hours on end, knowing we had to be up early in the morning, she would talk the whole time she was there, if we tried to talk, she would talk over us.  She would gripe about situations, but if we gave her advice, she did nothing to help her situation.  She didn't want a solution to her problems, she just wanted to come to our house every night and gripe.  It is one thing to have a problem, and maybe not know how to fix it, but it is another to just keep complaining about the same problem and do nothing to correct it.  We soon realized that she wasn't our friend at all.  She had some mental health issues and was afraid to go home, even though she had children at home.  She would go to our house straight from work, complain all night long, and then 15 minutes before her husband got off work she would go home.  She didn't want to be friends with us, she was just afraid of dying or something.  She didn't want conversation with us, she just wanted to gripe and gripe and gripe, but not change anything in her life.  The biggest issue we had is that she would come over uninvited, or call when we were trying to sell our house.  She would be on the phone for hours, yet we probably didn't get 10 words in.  I think you have to cut your losses when the friendship is totally one sided.  We had to contact the local priest and have him talk with her.  It became a situation of stalking, and had nothing to do with friendship.  I think he managed to get her to a doctor and get her meds changed, but we couldn't handle her anymore.  A real friendship is where you tell a story and I tell a story and somedays you may tell more stories than I do and somedays I may tell more stories than you do, but it is a give and take.  It isn't all about me, me, me, somedays it is totally about just you.  The deal breaker for us was a ratio of 100% to nothing.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Sometimes a friendship can be one sided. For I have a friend who's been down on his lucky for years. And I help him and his family out every chance I get. And he will always do things for me if I need them done. Yes I have done way more for him than he has done for me. But the main point is, he is still my friend. I don't judge friendship on what my friends can do for me. <br>  <br>  And yes I do agree there are times when friendships get used. And when that happens, then its not a friendship anymore<br>  take care<br>  dave|`|6c7f4670325dffd71786a00a601e83a6aa	you gotta understand that it's not a matter of percentage we're talking about<br>  friendships, intimate or not, always must have 2 things one of the is sacrifice...<br>  when this comes into the picture then the percentage aspect is taken out because you are in the relationship for the sake of being in a relationship, not how much you get out of it...<br>  as much as our human nature prompts us to want good returns... you have to realize that it not a bank investment<br>  go the extra mile to make it work- it you want it to work|`|euZRbiA2aa	I personally dont expect to get anything back out of a friendship.Sure my friends are the same with me.Sometimes i dont see or speak to my friends for months but when we meet again we are still friends.<br>  <br>  BQ 28 years.|`|7cei5ifNaa	ok i get it now

sqR0iyuWaa	dollar <br>  <br>  1553, from Low Ger. daler, from Ger. taler (1540, later thaler), abbrev. of Joachimstaler, lit. "(gulden) of Joachimstal," coin minted 1519 from silver from mine opened 1516 near Joachimstal, town in Erzgebirge Mountains in northwest Bohemia. Ger. Tal is cognate with Eng. dale. Ger. thaler was a large silver coin of varying value in the Ger. states (and a unit of the Ger. monetary union of 1857-73 equal to three marks); it was also a currency unit in Denmark and Sweden. Eng. colonists in America used the word in ref. to Spanish pieces of eight. Continental Congress July 6, 1785, adopted dollar when it set up U.S. currency, on suggestion of Gouverneur Morris and Thomas Jefferson, because the term was widely known but not British. But none were actually used until 1794. The dollar sign ($) is said to derive from the image of the Pillars of Hercules, stamped with a scroll, on the Spanish piece of eight. Phrase dollars to doughnuts attested from 1890; dollar diplomacy is from 1910.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=dollar" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term...</a><br>  <br>  But yeah, fiat currency is just paper, in a way.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  'Fiat' has a much more interesting etymology than 'dollar'.

Like the boy in The Emperor's New Clothes, they make observations which seem to cause frustration and annoyance to those public figures to which they are directed. A case in point is the word "dollar," the definition of which has been sought by Monetary Realists for decades.<br>  <br>  Some years ago Paul Volcker, of the Federal Reserve, was lecturing in St. Louis. A Monetary Realist ( not your author ) was in attendance. At the conclusion of Mr. Volcker's remarks, questions were invited, and the Monetary Realist asked, "Mr. Volcker, in your remarks you used the word "dollar" twenty-six ( or whatever ) times. Can you tell me what a dollar is?" There was a remarkable silence. Volcker said nothing. The silence grew protracted; it was embarrassing. "Well, sir, can you tell me what the yen is, or the mark? You mentioned them as well." The silence continued. Eventually, the host made some excuse and hustled Mr. Volcker from the stage.<br>  <br>  Over twenty years ago I wrote a letter to the head of the St. Louis Federal Reserve and asked another simple question: is our money tangible? If so, I asked, what are its physical characteristics? If not, how can you tell if you've got it? A brief note was received in reply, stating, in effect, that due to the "technical nature" of my question, the president ( of the bank ) was unable to answer at this time. He hasn't answered since.<br>  <br>  On discovering the ease with which federal officials can be reached via the internet, I recently decided to try again, and on September 6, 1998, sent this message to the Treasury Department: "How is the word "dollar" defined in U.S. Law? Can you give me the citation? Thanks." The answer received was from "Customer Assistance," and read, "Thank you for your recent inquiry. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) examines national banks to assure their safe and sound financial condition and to ensure their compliance with federal banking laws, rules, and regulations. The dollar is defined as a currency bill and monetary unit of the United States, equal to 100 cents. This Office does not have information on the specific cite in the federal regulations. You may try contacting the Federal Reserve Bank at 202-874-4700. We trust this is responsive to your inquiry."<br>  <br>  Well, not quite. I replied, on September 14: "Dear Customer Assistance: Thank you for your letter. You write that the dollar is a currency bill. Does that mean it is an IOU? An IOU for what? You also say it is a monetary unit. A unit is a standardized amount used in measuring. What does the dollar measure? Of what is it a unit? Thank you." This time I received a response from an actual person with a name, Angela Willis, a Customer Assistance Specialist. ( Customer Assistance@CAG@COC ) "Thank you for your recent inquiry. Please contact the Federal Reserve Bank for any other questions you may have. Thank you."<br>  <br>  I responded: "I would like an answer from the government. Isn't the Federal reserve a private bank?" Ms. Willis replied: "Thank you for your recent inquiry. The Federal Reserve Bank is the central bank of the United States Government. It was founded by Congress in 1913 to provide the nation with a safer, more flexible, and more stable monetary and financial system. We trust this is responsive to your inquiry."<br>  <br>  Wow! Talk about pulling teeth. I tried again: "I'm sorry, but your answer is NOT responsive. The question was, and is, "what is a dollar?" Don't refer me to a private banking cartel for the answer to what surely must be defined in U.S. Law. After all, if there is no definition of the dollar, how can a person measure his income in dollars and swear to the government that the answer is "true, correct, and complete?" Congress is given authority to regulate the value of the dollar. What is its value? Don't tell me it's 100 cents, and then define the cent as 1/100th of a dollar. Please try again. It's a simple question, isn't it? Thanks."<br>  <br>  Ms. Willis, was, I fear, losing patience with me. "Thank you for your recent inquiry. We have tried to direct you to the agency that could be most responsive to your inquiry. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency regulates national banks. This agency does not have regulatory authority over actual currency, although our name may make you think otherwise. If you have issues dealing with the national banking system, please feel free to request our assistance. We will not respond to any other inquiries regarding the definition of a dollar."<br>  <br>  In other words, the|`|28b1dKT5aa	the dollor(often represented by the dollor dign"$") is the name of the official currency in several countries,dependencies and other world regions

In some ways, this helps motivate you to better yourself, but getting depressed because of all the attention they receive is detrimental to your own development.  Try to see them as exemplars of what you want to aspire to... listen to what makes them unique, and find it within yourself.  Music is very individual, and you may find happiness in further self-discovery.  Afterwards, always look back and see how much you have accomplished, and allow yourself to be happy for who you are.  Obsessing about others makes you forget how to focus on yourself.  Good luck and be positive!|`|Oi2jylVKaa	stop worrying about other people, there is always gonna be someone who is better, so what?, the important thing is that you play the piano or do whatever you do because of the pleasure itcausess you, not for a competitionn, enjoy it, feel it, don′t compete!|`|1YR6c4XLaa	because you just need to focus and be happy with who you are, and you will then come to find out as long as you think you are the best then others will start to think the same...other wise you will forever live life never happy and thinking you can't do this or that..well you can do anything you put your mind to. <br>  <br>  so if you think your the best at piano then you are!. <br>  <br>  hope i helped!, <br>  i can't play piano for anything. and i'd be sooo greatful even if i could just a little bit. ;p

You are looking to the snake to coil around you and squeeze the feces out of you.   Hence the snake and the feces.  The dog was just there to blame the feces on because no one want to be blamed for poo on the carpet.

PFFDC8FGaa	From a simple financial point of view, Countrywide failed because it lent money to clients without making an accurate assessment of the possibility that the borrower could or would not pay the money back. <br>  <br>  Taking it a step further, Countrywide violated some common sense principles by lending extreme amounts of money for homes to borrowers that, as a whole, were not likely to be able to pay it back.  <br>  <br>  Imagine if you asked to borrow $100 from me.  If I was a rational lender who expected my money to be paid back to me on a timely basis with an appropriate interest rate added on, I would not lend it to you.  Why?  Because you don't have a job, you're in eighth grade so how are you going to make the income to pay me back.  But imagine there were eighth graders that had jobs(paper route, lawn mowing, etc).  There are a few who could pay me back.  THOSE are the ones I want to lend my money to.  What Countrywide did was determine that almost all eight graders were eligible for $100 loans.  You didn't have to show me your receipts for lawn mowing or being a paperboy to prove you had a job and income, I just believed you when you told me and gave you $100.  <br>  <br>  That's crazy, right?  Why did they do it?  Because now imagine that it really wasn't Countrywide's money they were lending.  They were lending on behalf of thousands of people who each put $10 into an account and gave Countrywide the authority to lend it out.  Countrywide gets a fee of $1 for every eight grader they lend money $100 to.  Well, for Countrywide to make money, they would have to lend money to a lot of eighth graders.  Since they were greedy, they moved away from the common sense rules of lending to rules that made almost every eighth grader qualify.  More eighth graders borrowed, more $1 bills to them and so on.  Now if you're the eighth grader, of course you'd want the money right?  They'd be too happy to lend it to you because they get their $1.  The problem occurs when the eighth graders can't pay it back because they were never really able to pay for it in the first place.  Now all the people who trusted Countrywide to lend money for them want their investment back.  Countrywide can't pay them so they become insolvent(unable to pay their debts).  <br>  <br>  Bank of America comes in and because Countrywide has a nice "mechanism" for reaching out to eighth graders, let's say they have a room set up in every middle school where eighth graders can sign an IOU and the money is handed out to them, Bank of America would like access to that mechanism so they purchase Countrywide for the sake of gaining access to those rooms. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, along with purchasing the mechanism to sell to eighth graders, Bank of America also had to take on the responsibility for a large portion of Countrywide's debts(those investors that gave them the money to lend in the first place).  So now Bank of America is in trouble because they did not properly calculate how much "bad debt" Countrywide had and those investors now are going after Bank of America for it.  Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Now if you think that it is stupid that one of the biggest banks on the planet would buy Countrywide without making a proper estimation of how much debt the company, you would be correct.  The major factors that contributed to the purchase were PRIDE and GREED.  Bank of America's CEO (the big boss) decided Countrywide would be a nice trophy to put up on his mantle.  He thought that he was paying a small price to buy the company and that thought process was guided in part by his desire for Bank of America to make more money.  That is not a bad thing per se, but it caused him to make a very bad business decision that even an eighth grader would know to avoid.  I hate to burst your bubble if it hasn't been burst yet, but that is how the world works.  Things that would make no sense to the likes of a middle schooler are done by adults in the interests of greed, hubris and self-interest.  <br>  <br>  If Bank of America had not purchased Countrywide, Countrywide would have gone bankrupt.  At that point, the company would be broken up and the valuable pieces (in my example, the rooms in each middle school where they lent money)would be sold off to individual companies at the highest bidding price.  <br>  <br>  As for Bank of America, because of this purchase(along with the purchase of Merrill Lynch, the other trophy), they are getting closer and closer to a collapse.  Had they not made these purchases they would easily be on the verge of being the strongest bank in the world (with the demise of CITI, UBS, etc).  Instead, they are on the precipice of being taken over by the government temporarily while they government decides what to do to get the bank healthy again.<br>  <br>  As a special note, these IOU's I've been using as an example are not initially considered debts.  They are actually called "assets" by the bank because they're SUPPOSED to produce income.  When these assets lose their value, they are then considered "bad debts"(sort of).  It's an accounting thing, but when you hear about "toxic" or "Troubled Assets" (the TARP program) this is what they're talking about.
