20090205084303AAXgJoy	Travel;United States;Other - United States	The reasons for moving?	I live in New England and I want to start fresh somewhere else. Is it better to move for family? Career? or Personal enjoyment?   My family lives in SC and I would be dead bored there but absolutely secure. It would be hard to find a great job though being that SC has the worse employment rates.   As for career... I would have to move somewhere like Texas, Ann Arbor, and maybe even Cali. All places where I don't know a soul! I want to consider it.. but is it absolutely horrible to move somewhere you don't know anyone at all? Thats how one would start fresh right?   As for personal completion. I would say Florida. My bestfriend lives there and she's 6 hours away from my family. However, I can't seem to find a good job there. I can see myself more relaxed there because the air is fresh and I'd have some friends to hang around with.

20090205091730AAUSh3W	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	You do remember these are true stories right?	Idiot Number Three of 2008         A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of America, walked into the Branch and wrote this, 'Put all your muny in this bag.'  While standing in line, waiting to give his note to the teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and might call the police before he reached the teller's window.  So he left the Bank of America and crossed the street to the Wells Fargo Bank. After waiting a few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo teller. She read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he wasn't the brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back to Bank of America.     Looking somewhat defeated, the man said, 'OK' and left.He was arrested a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of America.       Don't bother with this guy's sign. He probably couldn't read it anyway.      Of course I stole it.  Still funny.

20090205104933AApBs5T	Travel;Other - Destinations	I need some planning advice, help please!?	My friend is 19 and I will be 18 really soon. When I do turn 18 over summer, me and my friend plan to accomplish something big, which is bike (not motorbike, just a regular bike) from washington state to LA. We've done some calculations and it seems that if we keep going a certain, and doable, amount of miles each day, we can make it there on the time we expect to be there. We'd start collecting money now and by then, make sure we have a nice good amount on ourselves by that time. This is something I feel like I need to do in my life, it'd be complicated to explain how and why and everything, I'm committed to it though. We're training and conditioning these days right now for it on bike also. Is there anything I can know about doing something like this, like maybe someone out there has a long trip tale they can share to offer advice or anything? Or anything I can just know that could help out?
20090205110913AAAbWyO	Travel;United States;Other - United States	In need of a moment's peace/tranquility...Any ideas on a cheap beach vacation (specifically Panama City Beach)?	I would like to stay at a hotel on the beach, but it is not necessary. I know I will save money on a hotel not on the beach. What are some money saving tips for a vacation in Panama City Beach? It will either be just me or maybe one more person. I am having beach withdrawals. LOL I have been unemployed for 6 months, and I am just getting back on my feet. I need a vacation more than EVER! Even for just a couple of days. I HAVE to get out of town for a bit towards this summer. I find comfort and peace in watching the waves, listening to the sound of the ocean, and enjoying the warm sand, etc........... Seriously, it's not just leisure, it's very important because I have been having a VERY hard time, and I will need a vacation. It will be good for my soul.      I know rates are more expensive during peak season. It doesn't matter when I go, I just want it to be a good time to go while the weather and water is warm. I don't require luxury, but I don't want to stay in a crappy place or make it a rough vacation. Also want to know how to save money on meals, etc. Any suggestions?

20090203024828AAVzgAm	Travel;Italy;Other - Italy	Should I go to this trip to Italy?	Ok, so this is how it is:   Well, I'm in the 6th grade. I take Italian classes (in our school) and so do many others from my class (including my best friends). We will go to Italy in March or April and we have to decide (till Thursday) if we want to go. My best friends don't want to go because they hate the teacher. She's not so mean to them, but I don't blame them. It's just that the 3 people that are my best friends won't go (2 are 100% and the other on is 90% sure). And, not to mention that other people from my class (most of my friends [not BFF]) won't go, either. There are few persons who will go and they all are my friends (not BFF) and the boys will go, too (it's not so important, it's not like I have crush or something).       Here's my opinion:   I'd LOVE to go, but still I'm sad because they won't go. I still know that if I don't go to that trip, I'll regret it later on. And, my life motto is: 'Live your life so you have nothing to regret for!' So, I'll probably go.       I just wanted to ask you people what do you think about it.    Btw, in our class, there are no popular or un-popular people, we're all (mostly) friends or we have nothing against each other. But, there are exceptions. So, just to know, I'm ok with all people :).       P.S. We'll be spending 3 days in Italy, including Gardeland and much more :)      Thank you ALL :)!

20090202045418AA88miP	Travel;Australia;Canberra	Should OZ consider the Bradfield Scheme?	Should OZ consider the Bradfield Scheme?   Its crazy that the GOV of OZ is not considering building this scheme in these tuff times.      To all those who don't know what the Bradfield Scheme is read this:      Bradfield Scheme was devised by Dr John Job Crew Bradfield (1867-1943), a Queensland born civil engineer, who also designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge, and the Brisbane Story Bridge. The inland irrigation project that Dr Bradfield proposed, was designed to irrigate and drought-proof much of the Queensland interior, as well as large areas of South Australia. The scheme would require large pipes, tunnels, pumps and dams.      The scheme involved the diverting of water from the upper reaches of the Johnson, Tully, Herbert, Burdekin and Flinders rivers. These Queensland rivers are fed by the monsoon, and currently flow out into the ocean. The water would enter the Thomson River on the other side of the Great Dividing Range and eventually flow south west to Lake Eyre.      Basically building huge dams to hold the flood rains from the monsoon and clyclone rains and diverting to rivers so that they flow inland to lake Eyre.      The benefits of this scheme would be huge it would turn inland deserts and dry plains in to lush grasslands and would in-cease our farming production and potential.      Do you agree or have any more info?
20090203042046AAGvbNk	Travel;Air Travel	Why are planes loaded with the front seat passengers first?	Most planes are loaded through the door at the front.The first & business class passengers are called to go on first, so while they are trying to put their stuff in the lockers, they block the way for the economy passengers to get through to the back. It would seem more sensible to load the back people first, so they have a clear path in, and allow those who have paid more for front seats to spend more time in the airport shops and less on the plane on the ground.
