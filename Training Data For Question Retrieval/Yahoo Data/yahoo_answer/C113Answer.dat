IGYTuiFjaa	Si je peux me permettre, chevelureetc... n'a visiblement ni compris le sens de l'article, ni le sens de la dcision, ni le terme de constitutionnalit.    L'article 280 nous parle de qualits essentielles pour le conjoint.     Il ne s'agit absolument pas de savoir si, objectivement, la virginit est une qualit essentielle de la femme du 21me sicle.     Il s'agit de savoir si, subjectivement, la virginit de la femme qu'il veut pouser est une qualit essentielle aux yeux du mari en question.     Ces deux approches sont extrmement diffrentes, et  bien lire le texte, seule la seconde est  retenir, ce qu'a correctement fait le juge.     Une dcision ne peut pas tre frappe d'inconstitutionnalit en France. Seule une loi peut l'tre, par une procdure parlementaire, avant sa promulgation.     Il est impossible d'invoquer l'inconstitutionnalit d'une loi aprs qu'elle ait t promulgue.     De plus le "rapport homme-femme" n'est pas un  droit fondamental constitutionnellement protg.    En droit, parce que pour le mari, il s'agissait d'une qualit essentielle, et parce qu'il a t abus sur cette qualit essentielle, le jugement est non seulement fond, mais juste, et sera confirm en appel.    Aucun argument juridique valable ne pourra faire obstacle au fait que, pour cet homme, la virginit est une qualit essentielle de la femme qu'il veut marier.    @ Pingouin :300 de jurisprudence qui viennent nous dire qu'une qualit essentielle, en toute matire et en tout lieux, s'apprcie subjectivement et in concreto.    Ton raisonnement est en plus de ?a plus que foireux. Imaginons : je suis athe, j'arrive  dmontrer que, pour moi, la virginit de ma femme est une qualit essentielle de celle-ci = j'obtiens l'annulation de mon mariage.     Il n'y a que TF1 et quelques cerveaux pralablement javelliss  pour y voir ici, ou dans le futur, une question de religion.    De plus, depuis 1975 les enfants naturels ont exactement les mmes droits que les enfants lgitimes. Depuis 1975, le mariage est un contrat de droit priv, rien de plus rien de moins. Le fait que la crmonie soit publique n'y change pas grand chose.    Et non .. la loi n'a jamais, et n'a pas  interfrer, entre les tensions qui puissent exister entre enfants et parents/famille. Cela est du ressort exclusif de la sphre prive. La loi est gnrale et impersonnelle, doit on vraiment le rappeler ?   visiblement, oui ...    @PierreB : il est tout aussi faux de dire que le mariage n'est pas un contrat. Certes, il n'est pas possible de se soustraire  l'obligation de fidlit, et ? comme dans tous contrats, il existe un rgime d'ordre public, auquel on ne peut droger. Tout comme dans le contrat de vente vous ne pouvez vous soustraire  votre obligaiton de paiement.   A part le rgime d'ordre public, il est bien sur possible (et heureusement !) de ngocier les effets de son mariage !    Depuis 1975, le mariage est contrat civil, et uniquement un contrat.|`|lc6qaiLJaa	une instance judiciaire n'est pas un jeu avec un gagnant et un perdant mais aboutit  une dcision donnant gain de cause  une partie ou la dboutant de ses prtentions.  il ne s'ag?ra pas en appel d'annuler quoi que ce soit mais de confirmer ou d'infirmer le jugement de premire instance.    la question a port sur une erreur sur une qualit essentielle d'un des poux en l'occurence sur un mensonge reconnu.  la franchise en tioute circonstance est-elle une qualit essentielle lors d'un mariage, telle est la question pose.    la franchise peut tre considre comme une qualit alors que la virginit n'est pas une qualit en droit mais un tat physique pendant une priode donne.    la confusion est grande dans les esprits car la plupart des intervenants ne raisonnent pas en droit mais de manire affective ou motionnelle, voire pour certains de manire dogmatique en se pla?ant sur le terrain religieux dont la lgislation fran?aise ne reconna?t pas l'existence (article 2 de la loi de 1905 de sparation des glises et de l'Etat)..|`|25e62a48408f0ca32f6c927692590b0daa	Le justicier arrive !!

( ici l'absence de virginit )|`|Rv5wXnn5aa	aurguments fausse reprsentation une marchandise non conforme|`|ns6wvnhTaa	Pour approfondir ce qui est dit plus haut (NB : je te conseille de lire le Canard Encha?n de cette semaine, qui reprend ?a trs bien) :    Le TGI de Lille a considrer que le mari "percevait" la virginit de sa femme comme une "qualit essentielle" et donc qu'il y'avait motif  annulation.    Le dbat juridique porte sur ce point : une qualit "essentielle" est-elle essentielle parcequ'elle est per?ue comme telle par l'autre poux, o est-elle essentielle "dans l'absolue". La loi est muette sur ce point.     Nanmoins, on peut avancer plusieurs arguments en faveur d'une dfinition d'une qualit "essentielle" dans l'absolue :   * Si une qualit est ou n'est pas essentielle selon la perception de l'autre tmoin et notamment selon sa religion, un musulman pourra obtenir l'annulation de son mariage parceque sa femme a mentit sur son tat de vierge, mais un athe pourrait se voir dbouter sur la mme demande. En terme d'galit de chacun devant la loi et de respect de la la?cit, ?a pose quelques problmes.   * Certains diront que le mariage est une affaire prive. C'est en partie faux puisque le mariage est la reconnaissance par la socit de la vie en couple et donne des droits par rapport  la socit, reconnaissance des enfants par exemple. C'est aussi en partie faux puisqu'un mariage est publique, nul ne peut se voir interdire l'accs  une crmonie de mariage, sauf drogation exceptionnelle.   Mais quand bien mme le mariage serait une affaire prive, la loi a lgitimit  trancher car il y'a l motif de "trouble  l'ordre publique" : En lgitimant le fait qu'un homme peut considrer comme "essentiel" la virginit de son pouse, on lgitime de fait les pressions sociales, voir physique que la famille d'une adolescente peut exercer sur celle-ci afin qu'elle reste vierge jusqu'au mariage. Avec les tristes consquences que l'on sait...    PS : MAT775, o as tu vu dans l'article de loi qu'il tait dit que la qualit essentielle tait "pour le conjoint" ? C'est bien tout l'objet du dbat.|`|6tpgT3Wnaa	Article 180 du Code Civil      Le mariage qui a t contract sans le consentement libre des deux poux, ou de l'un d'eux, ne peut tre attaqu que par les poux, ou par celui des deux dont le consentement n'a pas t libre, ou par le ministre public. L'exercice d'une contrainte sur les poux ou l'un d'eux, y compris par crainte rvrencielle envers un ascendant, constitue un cas de nullit du mariage.    [S'il y a eu erreur dans la personne, ou sur des qualits essentielles de la personne], l'autre poux peut demander la nullit du mariage.    ---    C'est sur cet article qu'il a obtenu l'annulation. Pour annuler cette annulation, il faut :  - prouver maintenant que la virginit n'est pas une qualit ESSENTIELLE de la personne,  - ou que la dcision est anticonstitutionnelle dans le sens o elle dsquilibre le rapport homme-femme.

Exemple premier: l'avortement (?a s'est toujours fait, donc on l'officialise et on le rembourse). Exemples  venir: l'euthanasie (?a s'est toujours fait, on l'institutionnalisera par voie de consquence, avec paiement pour service rendu  la personne des infirmiers euthanasistes), le mariage homo (il y a dj le pacs, le mariage civil devrait logiquement suivre), la polygamie (?a existe dj; il faudra donner un statut et des droits aux relations bilatrales, ainsi qu'aux enfants issus de ces relations, ce qui est dj le cas, avant tout simplement de l'instaurer officiellement)...et autres dbats qui devraient suivre ces grands progrs de civilisation.

L'introduction de la perruque dans la bonne socit, sous le rgne de Charles II (1660-1685), fut une innovation  laquelle nul ne put rsister ! Dsapprouve dans un premier temps, la perruque fut adopte par tous les hommes de loi dans les annes 1680.     Il est difficile de reconna?tre les perruques sur les portraits de cette poque, parce qu'elles taient de couleur naturelle et parfois mlanges  une mche de cheveux naturels sur le front. Mais trs vite, elles sont devenues plus grandes et plus stylises. Vers le milieu du XVIIe sicle, les perruques poudres, blanches ou grises, devinrent la mode, puis furent rapidement abandonnes par la plupart des gens sous le rgne de George III (1760-1820).     Si, dans les annes 1830, les vques obtinrent du roi l'autorisation d'abandonner la perruque, ce ne fut pas le cas d'autres officiers ministriels. On raconte que Lord Eldon, le ministre de la Justice de l'poque, se vit refuser l'autorisation d'enlever sa perruque au tribunal !     Dans les annes 1860, pendant de nombreux de chaleur, les avocats furent autoriss  retirer leur perruque, ce qui suscita de nombreux commentaires dans la presse ; il fut mme suggr que l'ensemble des professions juridiques renonce  la perruque. Mais cette proposition re?ut peu de soutien, mme s'il est devenu courant, depuis, que les juges autorisent les hommes de loi  retirer leur perruque en cas de grosse chaleur ; parfois mme, pour des raisons religieuses, ils permettent que la perruque soit remplace par un turban.|`|tz9Nuc7Eaa	en Angleterre  parce qu'en France ce n'est pas la cas me semble t il...|`|9emMgSEJaa	Stage chez Pinder et Bouglione

Chicago to get millions in federal housing assistance    Housing Secretary Steven Preston said Friday that Chicago would get tens of millions of dollars to help improve mixed-income public housing and to help ease the blow of the national mortgage crisis.    Preston also announced that Chicago would receive $55 million in federal housing funds to buy and redevelop abandoned properties hit by the mortgage crisis    
JFUzHbpjaa	Good question. I believe McCain has even described himself as impulsive, and somewhat knee-jerk, in response to things.     "I don't torture myself over decisions. I make them as quickly as I can, quicker than the other fellow, if I can. Often, my haste is a mistake, but I live with the consequences without complaint."  John McCain  http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/...  (to which I would say, "Fine, as long as your rash, hasty, impulsive mistakes don't negatively affect the whole world, in which case you should probably not be president of the United States of America).    One recent example of McCain shooting craps: his pick of a VP candidate was a big gamble, he rolled the dice, plain and simple, choosing an unknown, unproven entity, sacrificing many of his own principles in choosing her, simply to appeal to an evangelical base and to energize them (they weren't fired up on McCain until then, they didn't trust him). The result of this gamble, is that because of Palin's ignorance and inexperience, which simply cannot be hidden, he needs to keep her on a tight leash, and can't afford to have her going out and talking to the media, or ordinary people,  and displaying her naivete (running a fishing business is fine, but does not give enough of the knowledge needed to be president of the entire USA - I'm sorry - call me 'elitist' but a president needs to be on a bit of a higher level than a potential drinking buddy; the nation's well-being is at stake - many people who voted for Bush thought he would be fun to 'have a beer with," and how well has that worked out? At least Bush knows something about law, having gone to Yale, and all, even though he chooses to repeatedly break the law or water it down; Palin knows next to zilch about law, and she could very well be president, which would be a scary thing, should McCain actually win. Contrast Palin's knowledge of the law, which is a necessity for any president, with Obama having been the editor of the Harvard Law Review, and his years of work as a state legislator in Illinois, in addition to 4 years of national experience in the Senate, not to mention campaigning nation-wide for the better part of the last two years... Yes, I may be biased, so sue me. McCain really would be more of the same as we have had with Bush, and maybe even worse than what we have had for the last eight years, which of course, has already been beyond horrible).    Back to McCain and his gambling impulses, how about last week's publicity stunt of "suspending his campaign," to go to Washington and "help save the economy?" He even tried to get out of last Friday's debate. A compromise deal which was on its way to ratification at the time, fell apart soon after McCain's arrival in Washington (although to be honest, I don't really believe this bail out really can't wait until after the election - it's just more fear-mongering to give more power and tax-payer dollars to Bush's "base" on Wall Street - "Be afraid! Be afraid! And give us the power and money we want, Now! Now! Now! There is a crisis, don't you know? And we all might perish otherwise!), and McCain's campaign was never really suspended, anyhow - the ads went on, and the McCain surrogates kept blathering on in the media, in his place.    Supporting the Iraq attack was also a gamble for McCain... back in 2003. There is no bigger example than that for mind-bogglingly wasteful government spending... 10 billion dollars a month since 2003... earmarks can't even begin to compare, and here McCain is trying to portray himself as the enemy of wasteful government spending.  It was all totally unnecessary, doing little more than enriching certain corporations which have been getting lucrative contracts in Iraq, certainly not making anyone 'safer' or making the price of gas cheaper. It only increased anti-Americanism, lowered the value of the dollar (contributing to the higher price of everything at home, including gas and food), and reduced the military's ability to respond to real and present dangers such as Katrina and God knows what else.  The proof is in the pudding.    What other gambles is McCain prepared to take? Nuclear war with Iran, or even Russia? Apparently there are plans in place for both of those scenarios. McCain's chief foreign policy advisor is a signatory PNAC member who is on the take from the president of Georgia, and these neocons have been trying to provoke Russia into war. Pat Buchanan explains:  http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?c...      As for the gambling "industry"... I don't know about Vegas, but it looks like McCain sees everything as a great big crap shoot.    No thanks. Give me somebody who can think about things and reasonably predict consequences, like Obama did back in 2002 regarding the hell-bent rush to invade Iraq, despite the lack of any immediate threat to America, and the disastrous possible consequences to Americas footing in the world, jts economy, standard of living, and military readiness. His speech on the subject is worth reading again:    I dont oppose all wars. And I know that in this crowd today, there is no shortage of patriots, or of patriotism. What I am opposed to is a dumb war. What I am opposed to is a rash war. What I am opposed to is the cynical attempt by Richard Perle and Paul Wolfowitz and other arm-chair, weekend warriors in this Administration to shove their own ideological agendas down our throats, irrespective of the costs in lives lost and in hardships borne.  http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/barack_oba...

Gambling is an addiction like drugs, but I say as long as he can hock his houses, that's his and wife's business. Now the abusiveness and bad temper may suggest another problem. I felt a certain irritability at Obama for (making him come to Mississippi-maybe) McCain was tortured in VietNam and has illnesses, in which some people defer to drugs and alcohol for relief. My uncle had post traumatic stress from WWII that he died with. The horrible vestiges of war is far reaching and long- lasting. That is why I am voting for a man who will not lead us into senseless conflict, who says talk to your enemies and get a common ground(sounds like someone I read about on Sunday) With Russia in the mix, the next war would be unfathomly terrible. |`|FhKfyxWlaa	No. Gambling away some dollars is much different than gambling with a war.

Il a t mis en examen pour "profanation de stles par des inscriptions no-nazies, provocation  la haine raciale et dgradation de biens destins  l'utilit publique" et aussit?t plac en dtention provisoire. Il est par ailleurs soup?onn d'avoir trac des inscriptions no-nazies "sur des piliers de ponts et des glissires de scurit sur l'autoroute", selon le procureur.    "Littrature nazie"    Le parquet a tabli "au travers des investigations que cette personne appartient au Front national", indiquant que de "la littrature nazie" avait t dcouverte au domicile du suspect, originaire de la rgion mulhousienne. Le procureur s'est toutefois refus  dire s'il s'agissait d'un militant actif. Le prsident du groupe FN au Conseil rgional d'Alsace, Patrick Binder, n'a pas souhait ragir en l'absence de toute prcision sur l'identit de la personne mise en examen.    La profanation avait t dcouverte le 30 avril, date anniversaire de la mort d'Hitler. Des croix gammes et celtiques avaient t traces sur les pierres tombales en grs. Deux drapeaux allemands portant des inscriptions  la gloire d'Hitler avaient t retrouvs dans le cimetire, les mots "Juden raus" (Les Juifs dehors) bombs sur une stle  l'entre du cimetire et les nom et prnom d'Adolf Hitler crits de part et d'autre des piliers de la grille.|`|ahBS0fFGaa	oui , c'est aussi ma vision de la situation  la marmite est de plus en plus sous pression et ?a risque de mal se passer  l'erreur majeure de l' umps  est d'avoir empech toute expression politique des courants nationaliste, souverainiste,identitaire ...    la complaisance generalise pour l'invasion et  l'islamisation  ne laisse plus qu'une alternative renoncer ou resister     dans une priode de resistance  il faut  valuer les enjeux et  choisir  clairement son camp:  les perdants ne seront pas les heros|`|rd1dlexaaa	Des tags raciste il en existe dans ma ville, ?a n'emeut personne parce qu'ils sont dirig vers les Fran?ais c'est marrant comme l'indignation est selective dans  ce pays.|`|Lh8j9TvJaa	C'est une exagration. Les premires victimes du racisme ne sont pas les blancs.|`|WXiimKcRaa	Je pense que faire des croix gammes en insultants les juifs et les musulmans est compltement dbile.    Imaginons que ces gens aient t victimes de racailles comme tu dis, franchement la probabilit est faible que ces racailles aient t des juifs.    Sinon il faut rappeller galement que les premires victimes des racailles sont des gens vivants dans les mmes quartiers que ces racailles et pour autant ils ne vont pas aller taguer des croix gammes.    Le racisme ne date pas de l'arrive des noirs et des arabes en France mtropolitaine, je dirais que la gnration de nos grands parents tait beaucoup plus raciste que les nouvelles gnrations, et contrairement  ce que tu dis je trouve que le racisme recule envers les noirs et les arabes mme si il est toujours prsent.    Il ne faut pas oublier qu'il n'y a que 160 ans que les noirs ne sont plus esclaves et  l'poque la jeunesse tait franchement plus raciste.      Sinon concernant les auteurs des tags on ne sait pas qui s'est. Dans les milieux no-nazis il n'y a pas que des fran?ais de souche loin de l. T'as des gens d'origine allemande, italienne, polonaise, russe, espagnol, bref un peu de tout.      Pour terminer je ne vois absolument pas en quoi le front national serait une solution.  Demande  tes parents qui taient les racailles de leur jeunesse ... des blancs majoritairement, ceux qu'ils appelaient les blousons noirs.    Le fait de virer tous les noirs et arabes de France n'arrtera pas la dlinquance, le front national se trompe de cible, au lieu de cibler en priorit ceux qui foutent la merde, il vise les immigrs.      @Prezouil...     Insulter les racailles oui, insulter tous les juifs, musulmans ainsi que les fran?ais qui ont subit l'occupation ou sont morts au front, c'est autre chose.    Si il avait peint sur les murs,  mort les racailles ?a ne me choquerait pas plus que ?a ( part le fait de dgrader une cole)    Comment peut-on tre fran?ais "de souche" et faire une croix gamme alors que la France a pay un lourd tribut lors de la guerre, des centaines de milliers de morts, des femmes violes, la privation de libert, les pilliages et j'en passe ... que les descendants de gens ayant vcu ?a puisse soutenir les bourreaux de l'poque ?a me dpasse|`|6fUxRdLqaa	J'habite un quartier comme ?a, et pourtant je comprends qu'a force de se faire insulter on ait envie d'insulter. |`|JJwKzy1Laa	Donc si des jeunes dgradent des murs de collges avec des tags racistes, c'est uniquement car ils sont victimes des immigrs.... ?

Mais surtout, ces jeunes fran?ais de souche (si ce sont eux, ce qui reste  prouver) dont tu parles sont manipuls par ceux qui font venir ces allognes et qui tirent ensuite parti de ces fresques non-conformistes.  Quand on manque de commer?ants chinois qui se mettent  vendre des t-shirts  caractre historique, il faut raviver la flamme de la commmo. Pour toute une conomie, c'est une question de profit financier.  Tous les deux mois, une affaire de genre (cimetire profan ou tags) revient avec la rgularit d'un mtronome.  Dans toute action (Pear Harbour, le 11 septembre) il y a ceux qui la font, ceux qui laissent faire, ceux qui font faire.  Cherche  qui le crime profite.|`|2519dc75ed067a952c6bcebfa4265e1faa	"Jeunes Francais de souche" ????  Parce que d'aprs toi, il y a deux types de Fran?ais ?  _ Les bons, ceux de souches, parfais, au del de tout mal, qui ont le droit d'tre raciste ?  _ Les mauvais, ceux qui ne sont pas de souche, dont le sang impur est dj un tel crime, qu'il serait normal qu'il abreuve nos sillons ? Par ailleurs quelque soit ces personnes, d'aprs ton discours, elles ne peuvent-tre que des criminelles en puissance, une sorte de nuisible pour la nation qu'il faudrait rejeter, isoler et agresser, ne serait-ce qu'en dcorant les murs des symboles du plus grand gnocide de l'histoire de l'Homme ? (Mme si ces symboles en 1940 ne les concernaient pas ?)    Pour ma part je crois que tu es un fasciste dans l'ame, ton discours colle parfaitement  celui d'un certain moustachu des annes 1930.  Plut?t que de pr?ner insidieusement la haine autour de toi, en faisant sorte de monter les personnes entres elles, peut-tre devrais-tu tout simplement ouvrir les yeux sur le monde qui t'entoure (et voyager un peu) plut?t que de les laisser river sur ta TV.      Note: Je suis effar par la quantit de propos racistes et fascistes sur cette question. J'ose esprer que ces rponses ne sont pas  l'image de la socit Fran?aise, mais uniquement le gratin des gars de la nation.      @unmytha: Les taggeurs sont des "racailles" puisqu'ils commettent un acte de dgradation volontaire.    @elrosbif: Tu n'as pas  te repentir, ces actions n'ayant pas t commises par toi, tu n'en est nullement personnellent responsable.  Croire qu'il y a des gens de "sang pur" relve d'une idologie du Moyen Age. Ce ne sont pas les anctres qui diffrencient les bons Fran?ais des mauvais, mais la personne, attache  une idologie, elle mme construite autour d'une nation pr?nant les valeurs de la rpublique Fran?aise. Et je me refuse  croire que le racisme et le sgrgationnisme sont les valeurs de la rpublique Fran?aise !  En soit, tes propos sont criminels, et tu ne vaut gure mieux que les "ennemis" que tu crois combattre.    Tu devrais lire les Droits de l'Homme, cela te remettrait les ides en place.    Autre question: Quel est le gne " Fran?ais " dont tu sembles pr?ner l'existence? Sur quel chromosome se situe t'il ?      Ce n'est pas aux politiques d'apporter une solution. Il suffit juste que les gens prennent leurs responsabilits et commencent  vivre ensemble au lieu de s'en mettre plein les dents. On est plus  la maternelle, l'poque des " tu es gentil maintenant et tu vas aller jouer avec machin" es rvolue.  Tu es grand maintenant, il serait temps de te prendre en main.    Dans l'ide de citoyen, il y a un principe pour lequel la personne agit spontanment dans l'intrt de la nation. Je doute que stigmatiser les personnes dans le but de crer des tensions sociales (en bref, de foutre la merde) comme tu le fais soit rellement dans l'intrt de la nation.  Je suis dsol de ta l'annoncer mais tu n'est pas un bon Fran?ais, tu fais partis des nuisibles que tu crois combattre. S'il y a une chose que tu peux reprocher aux autorits, c'est de ne t'avoir pas encore condamn pour ton racisme, xnophobisme, sgrgationnisme et ta sympathie fasciste, tout 4 pourtant rprims par la loi !|`|vIiGIHG3aa	DE QUOI ?|`|CLHzEEdfaa	D'une part, je rejoindrais Jean Yanne sur le fait que, "de mon temps",  dans tous les tablissements que j'ai frquent, j'ai pu lire des  "nique les keufs/la police/la France/etc.", "untel fils de p...",  "muslim powa !", "*nom de cit* en force", etc.    Tous crit soit par des racailles dcha?nes, soit par des petits cons  en manque de reconnaissance...mais je n'ai jamais vu un seul  journaliste...  Et pourtant, je peux t'assurer qu'il y avait -entre autres- un paquet de  menaces de mort.    Enfin, d'autre part, et sans mauvaise foi aucune, j'ai appris  tre  assez rserv quand aux tags "nonazis".  En effet, il est devenu courant pour des jeunes racailles musulmanes  de laisser ce genre de signature lors de sacages de cimetire juifs,  sur les synagogues, et probablement, maintenant, largis sur des lieux  de dlits qui n'ont plus rien  voir.    Qu'on se le dise : ce genre "d'information" est peut tre distill de  temps  autre pour annihiler toute envie de se poser trop de  questions  l'gard de l'immigration, en ravivant sur nous de vieux  sentiments de culpabilit...|`|PMVvLaXVaa	Je me pose juste une question par rapport  tout ?a : si les choses taient inverses, que les fran?ais taient en pays tranger et qu'il y foutaient le bordel, est-ce qu'en se dfendant les autochtones seraient racistes ?    Pour autant, je pense que quand les fran?ais font des tags genre croix gamme, ils se trompent largement d'ennemis.

Bravo!    Il y a fort  parier que, en usant et abusant de cette expression  l'emporte-pice durant sa campagne, Sarkozy ait trs bien pens  ce que cela pouvait signifier dans la ralit toute crue. Mais voil, cette catgorie n'tait pas intressante pour les objectifs lectoraux... On les oublie, ils n'existent pas! On se sert de mots-choc, au mpris de la rigueur sociologique.    (@Phil Defer, il n'a pas voulu mettre en relief un quelconque racisme de Sarkozy, lequel n'a jamais tenu,  mon souvenir, aucun propos limite, comme peuvent en tenir le borgne ou le fou du Puy.

L'thique passant au troisime plan aprs les objectifs lectoraux, ce slogan nous a t assn jusqu' plus soif, crant ainsi une dangereuse dichotomie entre le monde des feignasses, qui selon eux votent, comme moi j'ai fait avec beaucoup d'honneur, Sgo ds le premier tour, et le monde de ceux qui en bavent.    @Captaine. Ne t'en fais pas pour les pithtes ressasss jusqu' la nause que tu vas entendre, "dmago", "gauche caviar", "politiquement correct", qui dans la bouche de leurs auteurs ne veulent plus rien dire et remplissent les fonctions d'tiquettes que l'on s'amuse  coller sur des ides qui drangent, comme cette ide que tu soulves. Trop difficile, d'argumenter avec de vrais arguments. Ou alors on dforme ce que tu dis, comme:    @Vertigo. Savez-vous lire? Ou avez-vous besoin d'une explication de texte? A-t-il dit que "tous les noirs" se levaient t?t? O avez-vous vu cela, dans votre boule de cristal? Ou dans le manuel du bon militant sarkolatre?

However, worth noting that many legal experts say the law would have no effect on the same sex couples that have already been married since the court ruling allowing same sex marriage earlier this year.   Even if voters say "Marriage is between a man and a woman" in November, there will still be thousands of same sex couples already legally married.      Quite possible that those marriages will have to be legally recognized in the future as there's no precedent for retroactively enforcing a new law.    So, even if you think the definition of marriage should be a man and woman...there will be exceptions to that and it weakens the argument because the definition will have already been altered.    |`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	WRONG.

BBP4Hwfkaa	A Partisan Paper of Record    Today the New York Times launched its latest attack on this campaign in its capacity as an Obama advocacy organization. Let us be clear about what this story alleges: The New York Times charges that McCain-Palin 2008 campaign manager Rick Davis was paid by Freddie Mac until last month, contrary to previous reporting, as well as statements by this campaign and by Mr. Davis himself.     In fact, the allegation is demonstrably false. As has been previously reported, Mr. Davis separated from his consulting firm, Davis Manafort, in 2006. As has been previously reported, Mr. Davis has seen no income from Davis Manafort since 2006. Zero. Mr. Davis has received no salary or compensation since 2006. Mr. Davis has received no profit or partner distributions from that firm on any basis -- weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual -- since 2006. Again, zero. Neither has Mr. Davis received any equity in the firm based on profits derived since his financial separation from Davis Manafort in 2006.     Further, and missing from the Times' reporting, Mr. Davis has never -- never -- been a lobbyist for either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Mr. Davis has not served as a registered lobbyist since 2005.     Though these facts are a matter of public record, the New York Times, in what can only be explained as a willful disregard of the truth, failed to research this story or present any semblance of a fairminded treatment of the facts closely at hand. The paper did manage to report one interesting but irrelevant fact: Mr. Davis did participate in a roundtable discussion on the political scene with...Paul Begala.    Again, let us be clear: The New York Times -- in the absence of any supporting evidence -- has insinuated some kind of impropriety on the part of Senator McCain and Rick Davis. But entirely missing from the story is any significant mention of Senator McCain's long advocacy for, and co-sponsorship of legislation to enact, stricter oversight and regulation of both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- dating back to 2006. Please see the attached floor statement on this issue by Senator McCain from 2006.     To the central point our campaign has made in the last 48 hours: The New York Times has never published a single investigative piece, factually correct or otherwise, examining the relationship between Obama campaign chief strategist David Axelrod, his consulting and lobbying clients, and Senator Obama. Likewise, the New York Times never published an investigative report, factually correct or otherwise, examining the relationship between Former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson and Senator Obama, who appointed Johnson head of his VP search committee, until the writing was on the wall and Johnson was under fire following reports from actual news organizations that he had received preferential loans from predatory mortgage lender Countrywide.     Therefore this "report" from the New York Times must be evaluated in the context of its intent and purpose. It is a partisan attack falsely labeled as objective news. And its most serious allegations are based entirely on the claims of anonymous sources, a familiar yet regretful tactic for the paper.    We all understand that partisan attacks are part of the political process in this country. The debate that stems from these grand and sometimes unruly conversations is what makes this country so exceptional. Indeed, our nation has a long and proud tradition of news organizations that are ideological and partisan in nature, the Huffington Post and the New York Times being two such publications. We celebrate their contribution to the political fabric of America. But while the Huffington Post is utterly transparent, the New York Times obscures its true intentions -- to undermine the candidacy of John McCain and boost the candidacy of Barack Obama -- under the cloak of objective journalism.    The New York Times is trying to fill an ideological niche. It is a business decision, and one made under economic duress, as the New York Times is a failing business. But the paper's reporting on Senator McCain, his campaign, and his staff should be clearly understood by the American people for what it is: a partisan assault aimed at promoting that papers preferred candidate, Barack Obama.     Statement by Senator John McCain, May 25, 2006:   Mr. President, this week Fannie Mae's regulator reported that the company's quarterly reports of profit growth over the past few years were "illusions deliberately and systematically created" by the company's senior management, which resulted in a $10.6 billion accounting scandal.    The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight's report goes on to say that Fannie Mae employees deliberately and intentionally manipulated financial reports to hit earnings targets in order to trigger bonuses for senior executives. In the case of Franklin Raines, Fannie Mae's former chief executive officer, OFHEO's report shows |`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Are you serious?

6kUx7fwcaa	As usual the Bush administration has not consulted anyone who disagrees with them.  However, those people believe that there are other plans available that do not involve handing over money with no strings attached, other than governments removing company executives.  A bailout of one kind or another is inevitable.  In the end there will be a shifting of capital.  Some people will suffer, all people will feel pain, but pain is a relative sensation.  This economic mess was the result of business wanting to grow and there not being any space available.  So people created a virtual space with virtual finances.  They wanted growth at a faster rate than was possible and as with a runner who runs to fast and stumbles, so went the economy.  I think we are between a rock and a hard place and there is not better outlook from either shore.  You just have to take the punch.  There will be a better future, as there was in the past.|`|84844a44d4287e559d05ac952ff564f4aa	This is the biggest bunch of BS I have witnessed. There are no Pro's, only Con's.

His bill provides a blank check to the Federal Reserve without any safeguards and no accountability.  It is a "Financial Homeland Security" bill.  The world should be tired of his lawless policies and "trust me" attitude.    There are other economic alternatives that may be safer for the tax-payer and more in line with capitalist methods, such as actually buying stock to support these companies with tax-payer's money, not just handing the companies money and taking them over, like we are a socialist nation a la Chavez and the other world leaders who nationalized their industries.  But chances are we won't take that approach, which belies a distrust in the capitalist system.  Marx and Engels would have a good laugh if atheists believed in a life after death - or is that after economic collapse.  Ahh, but this is just another crisis we will survive, like a person with borderline personality disorder or bipolar disorder.  There will be many more highs and crashes before humans leave the face of the earth.

The government should not be directing any money, and should certainly not be ensuring any loans or accounts. People need to be responsible for their own investments; lenders need to be free to NOT make risky loans to people who can't afford them; Congress should NOT be in the financial markets and using taxpayer-sponsored enterprises to support risky social experiments, and the taxpayer should NOT be on the hook to bail out failed government intrusions into the private market.    People keep blaming deregulation, yet I only see that it was government intrusion which created the problem in the first place. Using taxpayers to secure bad debt secured by Fannie and Freddie, distorting the risk in the market, and making bad loans lucrative, it wasn't the free market that failed here.|`|AA10164318	Probably.  Reality has never been their strength.  It has a liberal bias, you know.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes and John McCain leads the way.
bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes but it's not over yet. This is far from a done deal. Wall Street will get what it wants in the end.    What is taking place is a vastly undemocratic process. As even the US media has acknowledged, the bailout is opposed by the vast majority of the American people. They, however, have absolutely no say in the matter.  In secret discussions, behind the backs of the people and within a few weeks of a national election, an unprecedented bailout of the most powerful financial interests is being rammed through. Its content and far-reaching implications are being concealed by a barrage of banalities and lies.  This infusion of cash into the US banks will do little if anything to stave off an economic catastrophe that is enveloping the working people of the United States and the entire world. Tens of millions face the loss of their jobs, their pensions and their life savings. But their crisis is not addressed by the bailout program.  Moreover, the bailout has set into motion a further monopolization of financial resources in the hands of a few banksJPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup. What is being presented as a solution to the financial crisis is a reorganization of power within the ruling class that will lead to an even greater concentration of wealth and a further deterioration of the conditions of working people.  No serious explanation of the historical origins of the crisis is being offered by the political establishment or the media. The unfolding disaster has not just developed over a period of weeks, months or even a few years. As those who follow the World Socialist Web Site are aware, we have been explaining the historical roots and tracing the development of the crisis of American and world capitalism since the inception of the WSWS more than a decade ago.  In Notes on the political and economic crisis of the world capitalist system and the perspective and tasks of the Socialist Equality Party, posted last January 11, the WSWS anticipated the outbreak of the current crisis. We wrote:  2008 will be characterized by a significant intensification of the economic and political crisis of the world capitalist system. The turbulence in world financial markets is the expression of not merely a conjunctural downturn, but rather a profound systemic disorder which is already destabilizing international politics....  Sixteen years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, an event which supposedly signaled the definitive and irreversible triumph of global capitalism, the world economy is in shambles.  For tens of millions of people in the US and all over the world, the events of the past week have come as a shock. Not since the 1930s has the bankruptcy of the capitalist system been so clearly exposed. These events will be followed by a growth of social struggles. But the critical issue before the working class is to draw the necessary conclusions about the nature of the capitalist system and the urgent need for a socialist alternative.    |`|atrdhRAlaa	welfare isnt fare...screw that    regulate that $h!t a certain wise president created alphabet soup agencies after war, because it gave people a chance to work for the money the goverment gave to them.

Why? It is unavoidable that this issue will be brought up again and again. The Bush administration will try less than legitimate and much more aggressive tactics until it gets its way.    "The price of democracy is eternal vigilance".     It is not clear who first said these words, but it seems that during the Cold War, and especially now under the Bush administration, Americans have not been very vigilant.     I can assure you that as we speak, corporations, lobbyists and their political allies are working hard to figure out a new way to get something similar passed. I know I sound like a conspiracy theorist here, but it is the cruel reality.     Washington is a "democracy" run by lobbyists and the corrupt. This issue will only come back more and more as the economy worsens.

CW8ah4Wgaa	McCain is the idiot that picked Palin as his VP.    His suggestion that luck or fate guides events after such a monumentally bad "first decision" only show his total lack of ability to lead the country back to prosperity.    If i was starving and standing in a soup line, while his buddies and him were lounging around one of his pools sipping cocktails...I don't want to hear "life isn't fair".|`|a2ae7d900a007a810f188405b3718ee9aa	Obama's plan tax the rich....But now he says bailout will postpone spending plans...  Senator Joseph Biden, had initially opposed the bailout, Obama pointed out that he himself had deferred comment. I think that in that situation, I think Joe should have waited as well.   For Senator Obama, nothing is more important than demonstrating that he puts the future of Wall Street above all other considerations.  Great change, you're right, life is unfair for the middle class.    I think people are naive....|`|tnagkORQaa	Nope, I don't agree with McWhiner...  He cries more than my 3-year-old granddaughter, what a whimp!|`|G7QOB88oaa	I think he is talking about the current economic crisis being the fault of the Democratic Congress, and he and Bush are getting blamed by the Mainstream Press that does not report the facts related to the Congressional hearings on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae where the Democrats call the regulators racists for bringing the problems to the attention of Congress.    I believe McCain thinks that the truth is not being told, and that the Press is deliberately suppressing these Congressional hearings and the fact that McCain was pushing for more regulation.    Everyone knows Obama got the bounce in the polls solely based upon the economic crisis of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, for which the Democrats were mostly to blame.|`|b9b51a3e74d46735103ead5dc025621eaa	Wow.     I have respect for McCain's military record. I also respect McCain for standing up to some of Bush's policies.    Having said that, I don't like his VP selection. I don't like some of his comments (one of which was cited as part of this question). I don't like his connections to the S & L Crisis.     Sorry McCain, but it's time for you retire.|`|72223fa7306b4ae26d4ff16a9606dc14aa	Yes - MSM is not reporting the truth - that it is the Democrats that got us into this mess. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63siCHvuG...   Go to 1:41 seconds to see Barney Frank - total moron! All the Dems should be thrown out of congress! It is no accident that Obama received over $100,000 from Freddie and Fannie in campaign contributions in his four years in the senate. While people think he was being all cool when this broke out - probably was just the opposite - trying to cover his bases so this does not come out before the election.|`|0e44f70a22356b4ec7f3b9dc96adf5bbaa	McCain doesn't understand that the chair in the oval office doesn't belong to him.    It belongs to the American people.  He doesn't have a sense of that.    Of course he thinks life is being unfair to him.  |`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	"Life isn't fair"...that is pure gold, right there.      It couldn't possibly be because people don't think he's got a good grip on economics, or that they realize he turned the whole thing into political theatre to make himself look good, and effectively screwed up the deal.     yep, it's because life isn't fair.     After reading Rolling Stone's article about McCain and his military carreer and upbringing, this is not a surprising comment from him.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Poor McCain, is that the best he can come up with? It shows that besides being angry and demented he has absolutely no insight into the dynamics of this election campaign. He sounds superstitious and resigned too.|`|85kWzSzuaa	No. Obama is rising in the polls because many Americans are to stupid to realize what a threat Obama is to this country.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	I wish life could be half as unfair to me as it has been to him. I'd settle for 3 &1/2 houses and 5 cars.    But no, I do not agree with his assessment.

I would say McCain did not do a very good "drift estimate"    choa Mistress  DINO|`|Wyt8vBPPaa	No. I think Obama is rising in the polls because people want change, which doesn't mean a Senator who has been in office 26 or so years and voted with Bush 90% of the time. Granted, Obama has voted with his party a majority of the time too but people are more fed up with the Republicans than the Democrats at this point.  I also think people don't like how dirty John McCain's campaign has been playing and how he's handled the economic crisis.     I think (hope) the country will be painted blue this fall and Obama will win.    Life's not fair John McCain, just because you're a war hero and have been in the Senate for decades does not mean you're automatically elected President.|`|PwLwmHtWaa	Obama has ZERO experience to be President. He has a college degree, has worked in the community, which millions of Americans are doing, and he has voted present in the senate.    Also, just look at all his radical associations, either he has a terrible judgement of picking friends or he is just like one of them. I believe the latter is true.    In addition, he is not what he says he is. Obama's father figure mentor (in his memoir book, he refers to him as only "Frank") was Frank Marshall Davis, leader of the Communist Group USA, which makes him very dangerous for our country. See link:    http://www.aim.org/aim-column/obamas-com...    Plus, we do not want our country to be controlled by Pelosi, Reid, Obama, and Biden. No thanks to socialism!! No thanks to higher taxes!! No thanks to more government agencies!! No thanks to a failed Congress!!    All these democrats, Frank Barney (chairman of finance commmitte), Chris Dodd (chairman of banking committee) are responsible for the financial crisis, allowing Freddie/Fannie making these bad loans to lower income people for years..... And guess who was the second most receipient of money from Freddie/Fannie, well it was Obama.     I have sent a letter to FBI to investigate, Obama, Dodd, Barney and SEC chaiman Christopher Cox... The FBI is already investigating CEO's going back 10 years, when the housing bubble started in 1998. They include, Freedie, Fannie, Lehman, Bear Sterns, Merryl Lynch, Washington Mutual and AIG. These are the people who are responsible of our money, banking system, and investments. And Obama has been receiving sweet deals from these same people.    This is very serious!!! Wake up America!!!      |`|iWBDVgP1aa	Wow a LIBERAL blogger found a quote and took it out of context. Why am I not surprised?|`|cLvsJEixaa	If life were fair, he would ahve beat Bush in the 2000 primaries and wouldn't be eligable to run in 2008.  So from a certain point of view, he's right.|`|pXg0SqiSaa	LOL. Figures.|`|mPIVFwReaa	No. Obama is winning because most Americans do not want to go through another 4 years of Bush;-)|`|Zyvl0iHvaa	I certainly agree with the statement that life is not fair, but don't believe that is why he is slipping in the polls. I believe he is slipping in the polls because people are concerned about Sarah Palin and how well she will do in the debate.  Once the debate is over and should she do well they will climb, should she do poorly they will drop like a rock.

Right off her queue cards! Can you say NO questions please?? lol    McCain's ties are facing renewed scrutiny after his campaign criticized Barack Obama for his link to a former radical who engaged in violent acts 40 years ago.    The U.S. Council for World Freedom was part of an international organization linked to former Nazi collaborators and ultra-right-wing death squads in Central America.    The council's founder, retired Army Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, said McCain became associated with the organization in the early 1980s as McCain was launching his political career in Arizona.    It only gets better I am afraid..............    Todd was a member of the Alaskan Independence Party whose goal is secession. Sarah has shown her support. AIP denies Sarah was a member but recognizes this support. AIP says Alaska First, not Country First. And, the AIP has linked itself to known terrorists.    Quote by Joe Vogler, the founder of the Alaskan Independence Party:    The fires of Hell are frozen glaciers compared to my hatred for the American government, and I wont be buried under their damn flag!|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Probably not.  They don't trust her speaking "off the cuff".|`|ZXkOQapLaa	I think she will since she got so much flak for not answering last time. I doubt if she'll stay on subject and will try to inject their platform of mud slinging into it but she'll be cut off promptly if that happens.
JxYLnTGiaa	Because he knows its silly to call someone running for President of the U.S. a "terrorist".    He saves that for all the stupid hicks that watch daytime TV.    He knows intelligent people wont buy that non-sense and it will just make him look desperate to win.    If Obama was a Terrorist, Bush would of taken him down by now.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	He didn't because its not true. and because he knows its not true, and because his own associations would then come under discussion and they are fairly shady too.  But it makes for a great scare tactic, even if it was thirty eight years ago.  Its sort of code for Obama is different, black, scarey, you know what THEY are like.  That one.    I hate people who try to scare me.  It just makes me angry.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	Because Bill Ayers isn't a domestic terrorist anymore, and he hasn't been one for about 30 years.  The fact is that Bill Ayers is walking free and isn't even currently charged with any crimes.|`|RPeqzomsaa	Thank you! I was sitting here watching last night wondering that myself. Why did we get the same boring debate we got two weeks ago? Why did McCain stand there like a frickin tree while Obama painted  himself to the undecided voters that he was a middle of the road, plain vanilla candidate instead of the radical leftist he really is? McCain should just drop out at this point and let Mrs. Palin run the show from this point on.     TTony. No it wasn't a question, but you don't have to answer the questions. Palin is a master at it by saying things like this, "that was a great question, but I want to talk about this..." She gets criticized for it, but in fact it's a common debate tactic.|`|cBT7pS0maa	Because it wasn't a question...     In my opinion the debate was kind of lame, no interesting questions, just the same old ones..|`|ex9GJHeiaa	He was having enough trouble remembering Senator Obama's name, don't expect the poor dear to remember that. LOL!|`|5yaNeOcSaa	Because he knew it was not really a viable link.  Plus, he has worse, more viable skeletons in his closet.  That's why his rating are dropping (along with his VP pick).  I am not being party affiliated...just keeping it real.|`|pmsFTFQtaa	It wasnt asked about.  in a town hall meeting you let the people ask the questions and you answer them as best you can (little tip to obama for future refernce there).  town hall meetings are about the people and not the candidates agenda.  i agree with most experts that the only way mccain should have said something about ayers is if it were asked    McCain/Palin '08|`|Iwi0iQamaa	Yes, I was very disappointed...I suspect, however, in that type of forum it would not have been a great idea.    I hated the whole 'debate'...it was neither a debate nor a town-hall event.    It was just two people standing in a more intimate setting spouting out their respective talking points.  Talking points, btw, that we've all heard a million times.|`|Lelr1AQfaa	He isn't the worst domestic terrorist, but the association still warrants investigation. To answer your question, he didn't mention it in the debate because the question wasn't asked. |`|k3SW7Dixaa	Ummm. Because Ayers is not a terrorist and never was?    So there is no actual evidence of his terrorism? Which may explain why a university as prestigious as the U of Illinois sees fit to have him on staff??    And McCain knows that as well as Obama does? And even he was not damn fool enough to let Obama tear him to pieces on it in the final televised debate?? Because that may have brought up issues of his associations with lobbyists and arms dealers??    He leaves all the foot soldiering to Sarah. Pilots like to cruise at 30,000ft and drop sh**t from on high. They don't get down in the trenches and fight!!    So much for the courage of the old soldier!!|`|kAt55Gbxaa	I think McCain is concentrated on exposing the purposed anti-big business that Obama supports  Obama said that he would cut taxes on 95 % of the people that means the largest employers will get hit hard then, we can watch our biggest businesses go to countries who will give them tax BREAKS.  its the "redistribution of wealth" that Obama purposes that will kill the economy|`|mZi7R0Enaa	I really wish he would bring up the friendship between these two thugs! Yes, I agree!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because nobody threw him any questions regarding this idiotic smear. The audience was much more concerned about the economy, war and health insurance. Smart people.
iVv6bFW2aa	Because thank God they haven't applied it to pre Iraq people. By the way he was a courageous fighter for the people, wanting to spark a revolution and an end to the war in vietnam,but his timing was wrong, and his tactics premature. Give the guy a break, he's doing great community work|`|kr6nMXcLaa	He is a revered professor.  He has disavowed his connection to old beliefs.  Lighten up. |`|KyI4I5Zaaa	Because his buddy is a US Senator.|`|Lelr1AQfaa	That is an excellent question (even though I am sure you are being sarcastic)! He should be locked up. I don't know why he wasn't. Maybe because he was on the run for so long and the statute of limitations ran out? He obviously isn't a danger to our society anymore, but he should still have to pay for past crimes, particularly since they were aimed at the government. Maybe the patriot act doesn't pertain to him since his crimes were carried out long before the act came into being.|`|GiC1mytPaa	So Adijo, are you saying that all Charles Manson has to do is to disavow any connection to his old beliefs and that we should  then we should let him out. Let bygone be bygones right? Tell that to the people affected by Ayers activities.|`|LowqcETwaa	we're a nation of laws    ayers was found not guilty|`|b254fc55f23ca642a2d4e5f7d284d285aa	He was not convicted because if a technicality.|`|0eR7sZNlaa	Speaking as a McCain supporter, I do not think Ayers is currently a danger to our society.  My issues with the Obama/Ayers link is, in my opinion, it shows Obama's poor judgment choosing to launch his presidential campaign in the living room of a known criminal - regardless of his current status.  To me, that speaks to his ability to make good jugment calls when he's in the white house.    Those that constantly try to link Obama and Ayers and portraying Obama as a terrorist are being ridiculous.  If you want to attack Obama due to this link with Ayers, do it for the right reasons - poor judgment - and not for being a "terrorist," which anyone with a brain, on either side of the aisle, knows is not true.|`|kAt55Gbxaa	he teaches at a liberal college and they will never allow it to happen.  liberals are so deep into American defeat that we are all going to suffer from their insane ideology.
tnagkORQaa	Well, Im not sure hell pull out, but I get the feeling that he will soon suspend his campaign in Indiana.  Its not looking good in Indiana for McCain  its been since 1962 that a Democrat carried Indiana and by the looks of it, Obama is going to do it this year.    Yesterday, the students at Notre Dame held a mock-election, and Obama won with a more than comfortable margin.    Its bad when even a Red State like Indiana has had enough and are not going to vote for McSame  The Republicans have a long road to recovery in Indiana and across the nation.|`|LowqcETwaa	Neveda|`|k3SW7Dixaa	No idea sweetheart, but as long as his whole campaign remains in its current state of disarray I think I will be very happy!!

Only 6 Democrats had the courage to Vote against Tranfering Money form the Public Taxpayers into Private Wall Street hands. Dennis Kucinich was one of them:    We Had Alternatives  by Dennis Kucinich  The following statement was presented on the floor of The House of Representatives after Congressman Kucinich voted against the Wall Street bail out plan, H.R. 1424, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008:    The public is being led to believe that Congress has reconsidered its position because we have before us a better bill than we had a few days ago. It is the same bill plus hundreds of new pages for hundreds of millions of tax breaks. What does this have to do with the troubles of Wall Street?    Driven by fear we are moving quickly to pass a bill, which may produce a temporary uptick for the market, but nothing for millions of homeowners whose misfortunes are at the center of our economic woes. People do not have money to pay their mortgages. After this passes, they will still not have money to pay their mortgages. People will still lose their homes while Wall Street is bailed out.    The central flaw of this bill is that there are NO stronger protections for homeowners and NO changes in the language to ensure that the secretary has the authority to compel mortgage servicers to modify the terms of mortgages. And there are NO stronger regulatory changes to fix the circumstances that allowed this to happen.    We should have created a mechanism for our government to take a controlling interest in mortgage-backed securities and use our power to work out a new deal for the homeowners. We could have done this. We should have done this. But we didn't.    Now millions of Americans will face the threat of foreclosure without any help. And the numbers will soon rise for a number of reasons. Not only because of the Alt-A, jumbo mortgages which will soon be reset at higher interest rates, but because the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is pushing up rates on adjustable mortgages and more than half of the US adjustable mortgage rates are tied to LIBOR. Homeowner defaults will grow in significant numbers. Let's see if Congress will be as quick to help homeowners on Main Street as they were to help speculators on Wall Street.    Now the government will have to borrow $700 billion from banks, with interest, to give banks a $700 billion bailout, and in return the taxpayers get $700 billion in toxic debt. The Senate "improved" the bailout by giving tax breaks to people in foreclosure. People in foreclosure need help paying their mortgage, they do not seek tax breaks.    Across our Nation, foreclosures continue to devastate our communities, people are losing their jobs, and the prices of necessities are skyrocketing. This legislation, just like the one we defeated last week, will do nothing to solve the problems plaguing American families or help them to get out from underneath the oppressive debt they have been forced to take on.    Unfortunately, there has been no discussion of the underlying debt-based economy and the role of our monetary system in facilitating the redistribution of wealth upwards.    It is not as though we had no choice but to pass the bill before us. We could have done this differently. We could have demanded language in the legislation that would have empowered the Treasury to compel mortgage servicers to rework the terms of mortgage loans so homeowners could avoid foreclosure. We could have put regulatory structures in place to protect investors. We could have stopped the speculators.    This bill represents an utter failure of the Democratic process. It represents the triumph of special interest over the triumph of the public interest. It represents the inability of government to defend the public interest in the face of great pressure from financial interests. We could have recognized the power of government to prime the pump of the economy to get money flowing through out society by creating jobs, health care, and major investments in green energy. What a lost opportunity! What a moment of transition away from democracy and towards domination of America by global economic interests.    Years ago, in a Cleveland neighborhood, I saw a hand-scrawled sign above a cash register in a delicatessen. The sign said: "In God We Trust, All Others Pay Cash." The sign above the Speaker's rostrum reads "In God We Trust," but we are paying the cash to Wall Street.    It is not as if we had no other choice but to pass this bill.
AXCrwjNnaa	En la Argentina hay 4 ipotesis al respecto de ese tema ninguna de ellas deja a fuera al estado argentino. Son culpables mire por donde se los mire. Son responsables porque es imposible que algo asi no lo sepa la Servicio de Inteligencia y o u otro servicio del gobierno sea prefectura u policia federal u bonaeresence etc.  Con respecto a la mujer policia te dire es una trabajadora del aeropuerto que ante ofertas obviamente que va a aceptar unos mangos mas siempre sera bienbenidos en este pais donde se difama a las personas por el color de piel o por la religion o forma de ser. Creo que hablar mal de las personas por aceptar hacer publicidades me parece incorrecto y desviatoria del tema principal.   Si bien es verdad que puede ser todo un tema de la C.I.A. pero que el gobiernoe esta hasta las manos metido en el tema eso a mi nadie me lo puede negar.   Son criminales, ahora si estoy diciendo que el gobierno esta metido en perjudicar al gobierno venezonalo y te diria que si y las pruebas estan a la vista solo tenes que buscarlas. Aqui es obvio que la gente desvirtuativa te va a hablar mal de la mujer que encontro la plata, o de los sospechosos que desde ya no son trigo limpio pero dentro de todo este tema digo como vos decis como es posible que la SIDE o el S.I. no sepan que entra y que sale del pais.   La SIDE o la actual S.I. que tiene profecionales entrenados en la C.I.A. y en el Mosad, no van a saber que entra y que sale en temas del narcotrafico y otras cosas. Me parece que nos toman el pelo.  A un detalle ahora esta el tema del narcotrafico y el triple crimen.

Ms an, nuestro gobierno (Argentina), se jacta de que las agencias del Estado, que ellos dirigen, hayan descubierto el dinero. Segn ellos, es indicio de eficacia en los controles.  ?Qu papel jugaron los K?   Primero, negaron el hecho. Luego, lo aceptaron abrumados por la informacin que circul en la prensa.

Los gobiernos de Argentina y Venezuela mienten u ocultan informacin y, sin dudas, intentan que nada se aclare. Tambin mienten o dicen media verdad los que declaran en el juicio de Miami. No es creble que el dinero fuese para financiar la campa?a presidencial de Cristina Kirchner. Fue la campa?a ms costosa de nuestra historia y los 800 mil dlares eran una cifra insignificante. Ellos mismos, los Kirchner, son los gobernantes ms ricos que hayamos tenido.  USA aprovecha toda esta confusin para sacar provecho poltico contra Chvez, bsicamente. Y lo est logrando.

EVIL!  |`|OqcTPhiSaa	I think the problem with the Greens is that they don't have a strong leader. If they had a more charismatic, clean-edged poster-child, then yes, they might get a few more votes.    I think this is a similar problem for the NDP. Layton is strong, but he's not quite "lead-the-country" material. I could never vote for him. I'm too accustomed to seeing him act as the "keeping them honest" intermediary between the two big guns.    I don't think Harper is being "secretive" but I do think he's likely flying well under the radar. He's probably dodging any kind of controversy, and he's probably wise to do that.    I think Duceppe is a brilliant man. The problem is he's Bloc. He'd be excellent as priminister if he were liberal, but with the Quebec agenda as his ONLY agenda he's fairly useless to me. As an English-speaking, Alberta-born Quebecer, Duceppe sees my existance as an affront to "The Federal Nation of Quebec." So I stick my finger down my throat and reply with a *screw you pal* by never, ever voting for the Bloc.    I'm surprised people haven't mentioned that their local ridings have everything to do with the strength of the overall party. If the leader in each constituent is strong, the whole party will be strong.    The problem we had last time around resulted from the big pigs (Chretien & Martin) being seen as such incredible villians we needed to simply dethrone them. People had to vote over and above their own ridings in order to "sway the greater vote". We needed a change from the top down, at the time.    This time around it's different. We can go back to voting for local candidates the way we used to. My PC guy isn't stronger than the liberal candidate in this area, but he is offering me something the liberals aren't, which is more bilingual services in my area. I need that so it'll be a tough decision.    If someone has a very strong Green leader in their area, they might do best by voting for that person, even if it would be very scary to see the Greens get elected federally.    A few years ago, all the liberals (well, most) were quite strong in the east. The NDPs were strong in the maritimes. And the conservitives were stronger out west. Since Harper arose, a few of us in the east (Quebec/Ontario) are getting a chance to contrast the strength of the candidates running on lower levels. However, the libs are still heavy hitters.    Federally speaking though ... I don't think Dion has the fortitude I'm looking for, at least not yet anyway. I see that Harper has some flaws, but overall he hasn't made my life any worse, maybe even a bit better. I really admire Duceppe, but he's cold and I can't afford to vote for him, ever. My life as an Albertan living in Quebec would be over - tout fini! And as for the Greens? Geez, they just need to keep drumming support and get their heads above water. I think they look promising, but I really need to see them in action a LOT more. Layton and the NDP are ok, but like I said before, I live in Quebec. Nearly a quarter of Canada's entire population lives in this province. It's a very, very different place. The dynamics in this province are unlike any other place in Canada, and I really don't think Jack Layton comprehends either the strenghts or the volitilities that take place here. To vote for him would be like asking a mouse to confront a cougar.    My prediction is that the country will keep harper with the intention of leaving well enough alone - but we'll all be watching the liberals to see if they can reinforce themselves for the next election. I admire the Greens and I hope to see more of them in the near future. And I think the NDP needs to reconvene altogether and come up with a new strategy and stop playing monkey in the middle.|`|ybsKPfcdaa	Are you telling me Nader runs in Canada, too?|`|rYT9OnXzaa	The Green Party is the biggest load of crap since Paul Martin.

My may see a large block of registered democrats vote McCain or not select a candidate at the booth.     And to add another instresting twist- have you factored in the "Operation Chaos" that Rush Limbaugh launched? He has been to be responsible for convincing 3.2 million repubs to register dem to disrupt the primary election and drage Obama over the finish line. This was an effort knowing that Clinton would no doubt beat McCain in the general election, and Obama was much more beatable.     Those phony dems are still on the books in key swing states as newly registered dems.  Just ponder that.     Nonetheless, voters should keep their eyes open. We have two parties in America willing to sell us all down the Socialist drain.

AXCrwjNnaa	Las madres de Plaza de Mayo fueron montando una estructura institucional, la cual hay que mantener economicamente. Por lo tanto los recursos economicos se consiguen de la forma que sea. Eso es ley en cualquier parte del mundo, no es etico, pero las cosas estan dadas asi. No le quita merito a su lucha y a todo lo que se ha consiguido. Quedara en su conciencia individual su accionar, no somos quien para juzgar a nadie.   En todo hay claros y oscuros. Sino el mundo seria blanco y *****.  Y toda institucin tiene su depuracin, su evolucin, su plenitud y su decadencia.   Seria grave si consiguieran fondos de negocios contradictorios a sus principios y fundamentos. Pero no creo que sea el caso de Madres de Plaza de Mayo.|`|l6UKwzUXaa	I can read the question, I just have no clue what it means in context.  lolol|`|cac8b274f937acca95d8e842c7e84260aa	My Spanish is good enough to understand most of that but there is no way to write back in Spanish without risking accidentally asking you about a pet duck or something equally stupid      Who are you talking about in reference to the struggle for justice these are new names to me completely ?|`|EfskmX5Zaa	Amigo, en primer lugar, Hebe no fu la fundadora de las Madres...  El acercamiento entre ellos, se di en el momento en que los Kirchner se percataron de que podan lucrar con los derechos humanos (parciales, se entiende no?)...  El resto lo hizo la avaricia de la se?ora Bonafini y el oportunismo de los K...que entre otras cosas, utilizaron a la asociacin "Madres", para lavar dinero, sin ir mas lejos, el del ba?o del ministerio con la ex ministra Felisa MIchelli a la cabeza...  Se dice tambien, que la "Villa 31" se financia con dinero que el Estado les aporta a las Madres (y que administra, Hebe).  Sobre la divisin de las "Madres"?...la mencionada avaricia y oportunismo de Bonafini y el desvo esta, en sus "objetivos iniciales"...

Sera raro que gobernantes tan involucrados en la causa por los DD.HH. y la justicia, no se sintieran cerca de la noble causa de las abnegadas Madres. |`|viCR8kUzaa	Madres y abuelas son dos "bronces vivientes" con los cuales uno pude coincidir o no. Bonafini pertenece a la linea disidente, la division se produce por internas y por distintos estilos de afrontar la misma lucha, el grupo de Hebe es el mas "radical" si queres llamarlo de alguna forma. El acercamiento se produce desde la llegada de Kirchner en el 2003, siendo el primer presidente desde la recuperacion de la democracia (1983) que le permite la entrada irrestricta a a las Madres a casa de gobierno. Con Kichner se produjo varia avances en cuestiones de DD.HH como el recambio de la corte suprema de justicia, la incostitucionalidad de las leyes de obediencia debida y punto final que produjo un retorno a los juicios contra represores (ahora van a carcel comun, hasta Videla). Ahi s eproduce un acercamiento, tanto Madres como Abuelas repaldan el proyecto politico y economico de los Kirchner, razon por al que asisten a todo acto oficial de ellos. En la partida presupuestaria se incluye dinero para Madres y abuelas
CaogIDbXaa	Take a look at your question, the answer is already there ... "Republicans" but most importantly those who think and act like Bush and McCain.    But not all Republicans are like that, there are a few of them who have come to their senses and are starting to see the other side of the argument and are trying to come to a decent conclusion for themselves instead of listening to what Bush and McCain say it should be.|`|vYTRMm69aa	I suppose they are ignoring it because it is their biggest downfall during their political reign. I have to say your analogy of what the Republicans have partaken in and forced on the Americans is the best on Yahoo I have read so far. Thumbs up for you!|`|FGWEHVZ9aa	Because they just want to talk about superficial politics and non sense unsustantial attacks on the opposition that's called desperation    Source     ex-Republican|`|Wrf5orAuaa	Why wouldn't you ignore your obvious shortcomings? If you ignore them, maybe everyone won't notice.|`|6mLj2x8Iaa	we have not won the war!  The 9/11 attack was attack against economy! republicans admit that!  Bin Laden has said he can't bring down the superpower but he can bring superpower bring down itself.  as long as economy is in a such a state, we have not won the war!|`|o0UD2YvPaa	Well you can't ignore what is right in front of your face.  If you will take a look at the time line of this financial fiasco you will see that this mess we are in is due to deregulation of the Clinton administration.  It is all the doings of the Dem controlled congress who were warned by the Reps several years ago, and they chose not to do anything about it.  They knew this bubble was going to burst during the bush administration, and they could point the finger at him.  and they have.  The republicans know of the economy, and tried to get the Dem's to do something about it several years ago, they know about the war, and are in discussions with Iraq to get our men and woman out of there in the next 2-4 years, so this is not a new plan that Obama has come up with, and he has even said that he cannot take them out right away, that there has to be a strategic plan to remove them from Iraq.      I would suggest this  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RZVwno2A...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MGT_xSi7...|`|yuBuNoPDaa	They are filthy rich and act only in their interests. They are the true terrorists of this nation. Are they not?     They said they would protect us from terrorists but have since assumed the role. |`|uafeJiNjaa	THEY WANTED TO PLAY SMEAR POLITICS. WE HAVE ALSO EVOLVED AND NOW IS FIRE FOR FIRE.  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=9WN_V8Fple...|`|T7WlMHrZaa	The Republicans in particular Bush and McCain have failed us on both the war and the economy. They don't want to point out their failure so they try to distract the American voters with crazy story's about President Obama. |`|Pv9ALQfpaa	Do you mean the Republican leaders or the Republicans in general... becuase if you are lumping us all together then you just need to stop right there.... Because there are many of us that are looking at these problems and watching what the outcome might be... and while you are putting emphasis on stories of fighting and violence I just saw a story on Today this morning that was talking about some of the good things that are happening and that there is less violence there now then there was even months ago.... though I am only taking that as a partial... |`|m5MWGyXXaa	they lose if they run on the issues, but they will lose anyway.|`|fBvhkalFaa	It is their stay the course mentality.  They refuse to admit mistakes.  On the candidate backing, if we Democrats had anybody but Obama running, this wouldn't even be close.|`|0RXSCb41aa	The economy started getting bad when Pelosi and other dems took over congress! If you must vent about or question the republicans, you really need to do your research. 95% of ear marks/pet projects that were added to the bailout were by liberal democrats!!! Look that up too. That means they dont have a problem with us, taxpayers, paying for their little extras.  The fact of the matter is, McCain and Palin both discuss, in depth, the economy and what their plans are, dems refuse to hear anything but the negative! Then claim that facts such as, Ayers and Obama worked together to CHANGE college students in Chicago into radicals against the government, I'm afraid that is Obamas CHANGE a lot of ignorant people will be voting for. We can NOT afford to elect Obama, read this and really think about this, all anger aside, HE is anti-American!!! The company he keeps, keeps, means still associates with, to this day, are radical anti-American extremists!!! Don't you all get it??? He lies! He WILL raise taxes on everyone! He WILL side with his muslim brothers as he said in his book about his father! Hello, he and Ayers were exhilerated about 911!!! We can NOT afford to have Barack Hussein Obama as president of the United States or we will fade away dramatically and rapidly into a socialist, very poor, very controlled society. Do your homework. McCain LOVES AMERICA and you and me! Obama does NOT! He is a liar! It is up to us to make it right and Obama is wrong!|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Your right in that it wasn't just the Democrats that are responsible for this current financial crisis.    McCain was part of the start of the sub-prime lending crisis, with the Keating 5. However; 4 of the 5 were Democrats. 3 of which "had substantially and improperly interfered with the FHLBB in its investigation of Lincoln Savings..." and McCain was "...cleared of having acted improperly but were criticized for having exercised "poor judgment"."    But if your really looking to point fingers, just take a look at the facts.     This whole thing really ballooned in 1999 when the Clinton administration and Fannie Mae shareholders pushed lending companies to "increase the number of mortgage loans offered to those of low and moderate income, both to improve rates of home ownership among those groups and to increase profits."     So who's the greedy rich white guys now?    The Republicans, including Bush, saw the impending disaster and wanted to tighten the lending requirements to try and stave off this crisis. But their efforts were blocked by a Democratic congress who just wanted everyone to be a home owner; And most likely, line some pockets.    I don't see Obama as being any different, nor do I think he's going to make the situation better. Neither will McCain.    Both candidates know that we can't just pull out of Iraq. And I think your underestimating how effective our troops surges have been. Violence is down substantially, but you are right; We can never end the violence there. And I honestly feel we will always have troops there just like we do in Germany and Japan.     I see the failures as government to be all encompassing. Meaning everyone is equally to blame for the current messes we are in.    I really wish I had a candidate that I could truly get behind. But I don't. Neither candidate satisfactorally address the concerns I have, and I have seen no solutions offered by either side that I can whole heartedly back either.    I'm sick to death of this two party system, and people looking to assign blame, when we should be working together to solve problems and make things better.   |`|cUVoBiEkaa	The fact is we are winning the war but we shouldn't leave until its done. But cowards like you &  Obama want to run.     Your Democrat buddies have more to do with the current financial mess than the Republicans do. Look it up.|`|0LfoDLFUaa	You can't push the blame to one political party.  They both played a major role in this mess the country is in.  To believe otherwise in naive. We are not going to get out of the hole we are in anytime soon, but look at who has the best plan..John McCain is not Bush anymore than Obama is Ayers.  The problem is Obama has no record to compare anything on, he hasn't been in office long enough to predict what he will do.  Ya'll are just hopin'. good luck|`|DhLcUzzSaa	We aren't looking for an "elusive victory" we're staying to keep the peace until the Iraqi government is strong enough to keep control of the country. The surge has worked, and violence is at an all-time low.    The Democrats blame the Republicans for all the economic problems.. hmm, who is currently controlling congress? Yep, the democrats. It's pretty hard to sign bills into office as president when no bills are coming through from the Dem-controlled congress. Oh, did anyone know that the Democrats were behind the whole affermative action "everyone can get a mortgage loan" idea that is responsible for the current financial crisis we're going through? It's amazing what you learn from doing research as opposed to watching CNN and blaming everything on Bush.|`|82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	I am thinking it has something to do with the fact that they are too busy touting themselves as "mavericks".     Mavericks don't have time to worry about little stuff like that...|`|zB7Hl7x2aa	because liberals are to blame for the banking crisis,and liberals call our troops NAZIS,during war,liberals %uck!!|`|7mTqbBq8aa	Your facet for information is tainted with liberal demo-crap.

We will pull out when they can govern themselves without being takin by corruption. 
rOv94JgGaa	The nastiness that is Palin is showing daily. She plays to the lowest common denominator, is followed by those that you woudn't want as neighbors, is the best thing that could have happened to the Obama campaign and the sooner she ships back to Alaska the better....    Thanks Sarah for giving Obama a large lead.|`|sPuwaf7Saa	Obviously we all want justice...and that crowd yelling at reporters was classic.

I also think the markets keep dropping based on polls that Obama is winning and that is probably a big worry also.|`|6810e02779e654863b71475b91405d0aaa	Market are priced by short term investors because they do most of the trading, so what is happening  in the election is not what is driving the Dow because the    president can not have much effect for a year.|`|60x7RSebaa	Another brilliant question which shows you have a true understanding of what is going on in this country and what caused it. Brilliant........simply brilliant.|`|cFqEp5x8aa	Maybe but you would think that these folks would just choose not to vote for McCain versus selling their stock...but stranger things have happened?|`|MLsi9ENOaa	I don't think anyone can soothe the market. Its beyond the actions of one man or woman.|`|e68ed70654e71ea7f425cc92736a0d51aa	Probably partially true.    The people on wall street know what the issues and problems are.  It is not a dem/rep issue.  It is a government corruption issue.  If the government would fix the problems, and deregulation was not the problem, then wall street would stabilize.    A bailout doesn't work unless the problem is fixed, and since neither party wants to address the real underlying issues, then we are bailing water out of a boat that has big holes (and we know that doesn't work)|`|7qxqkjNhaa	Republicans run Wall Street or does business? Get over it already business does not care if your black white republican democrat just about money and how to make it. 
iVv6bFW2aa	The word is still there.but Sarah is a prototypical example of it in politics. For that reason I would hate her to be in the White House, she might react hysterically and vengefully, as she's been known to do.|`|e1z8pHfmaa	I was unaware that it had left the American vocabulary.

During the rally, out of nowhere, my friend yells "the N****** needs to die"... I was dumbfounded! I couldn't believe it.  I immediately took him out of there, and asked him what the hell was he doing... he said, "oh come on, I just said what you all want to say"... we are no longer friends, and I owe him for his ER visit... he can collect when he apologizes."    I suspected an Obama plant, but this possibility does not surprise me. Why? Because:    {Found this little gem in the middle of a NYT article about Obama's recent spate of false attack ads about McCain.      The increased advertising push has been accompanied by a campaign by the Democratic National Committee featuring an emotional advertisement shown on African-American-oriented programs meant to encourage blacks to register to vote. It opens with violent images from the civil rights era of black marchers being attacked with power hoses and the words, Thousands died so you could vote, the advertisement states. The advertisement was not publicly announced by the party.    Source New York Times 9/25/08}  AND:  At a Nevada rally... Obama said this to about 14,000 people:    I need you to go out and talk to your friends and talk to your neighbors. I want you to talk to them whether they are independent or whether they are Republican. I want you to argue with them and get in their face,    It is not Palin who started this crap, but the Obam camp. Below are links with evidence, though I know none of you Obamaites will bother to look. Here's something else interesting:  Wednesday, September 17, 2008  New Scientist mag uses software to analyze campaign speeches; concludes that Obama is  1 Bullsh*t artist; McCain is a straight talker.  The algorithm counts usage of first person nouns - "I" tends to indicate less spin than "we", for example. It also searches out phrases that offer qualifications or clarifications of more general statements, since speeches that contain few such amendments tend to be high on spin. Finally, increased rates of action verbs such as "go" and "going", and negatively charged words, such as "hate" and "enemy", also indicate greater levels of spin. Skillicorn had his software tackle a database of 150 speeches from politicians involved in the 2008 US election race.  Each of the candidates had made speeches containing very high and very low levels of spin, according to Skillicorn's program, depending on the occasion. In general though, Obama's speeches contain considerably higher spin than either McCain or Clinton. For example, for their speeches accepting their party's nomination for president, Obama's speech scored a spin value of 6.7 - where 0 is the average level of spin within all the political speeches analysed, and positive values represent higher spin. In contrast, McCain's speech scored -7.58, while Hillary Clinton's speech at the Democratic National Convention scored 0.15. Skillicorn also found that Sarah Palin's speeches contain slightly more spin than average.    So it boils down to this: Who would you rather have as President:    a) The man who uses his gift of oratory to spin whatever he wants you to believe irrespective of the facts?  b) or the man who tells the truth but does it in a relatively boring way  |`|l7NZRSs9aa	The angry bigoted mob is a long-established voice of the people in American politics. It is a predictable group of emotion-led people, where the larger the crowd, the lower the intellect is the formula breeding ignorance.  It is important for the least common denominator to also have a voice in American Politics, as this is guaranteed by our Constitution.  Some enlightened may argue that it would be ideal to have a fully educated population going to the polls, but this would not be a true cross section of those who attend rallies where the goal is to discredit the opponent.  Our nation (like a mighty chain)can only be judged by it's weakest link. The strength of our chain is in that it allows each link an equal say in the course of this Nation. We can all support or reject our Party's choice for leaders.  We are equally given one vote, no one's vote is worth more than another's .So race, faith,and past associates are not important. This election is about the United States going broke! Neither party cares about this really.  We can reject current Parties and write in whoever we choose to.    my view for whatever it is worth,    If you are poor, I mean really poor because of past 8 years..  No Job, No money, investments gone, family split up, health problems, no insurance, and eating like a hippy (beans,rice,peanut butter,etc...),Then add up all you have to show for your life and vote  for me, Hippy Dave Adam artist/poet/dreamer  I don't have anything to lose so I can be honest with you always.  I am truly one of us, with our interests at heart.  I am within Constitutional rules of eligibility , I am over 35, Born in Florida 1961,not currently wanted for a felony, and I have some good ideas.  I will use the internet to ask people what they want, and then we make the rules from there.  First of all the 800B would be distributed to the Americans over 18 not currently here illegally, or in jail for violent crimes. This is the basis of my platform for President, do not let Banks and rich people have that money, let us all have it and as we spend it the Economy will rebound.  Think about it, if we all had 1/2 Million each, tax free    The following would be withheld from your 1/2 M stimulus check prior to your getting it:  All in the arrears child support owed  All student loans  All civil suit liability (Like OJ owes Browns and Goldmans)    All the rest can be used by us to get caught up with mortgages,credit cards etc..  I think this upward spending will turn credit markets around and banks will be begging us to make loans. This time around they will be regulated as to who qualifies for loans.  I would use my extra money to make an electric car.  I know of others who would revolutionize transportation from their garages with alternative energy vehicles and inventions if they had this kind of free capital.  The tremendous upswing in the economy would drop interest rates  (the difference in interest will eat a big part of the loan we just made for 800B). The money the lenders are holding to so tightly now will lose a big chunk of it's value to loan us now because we all will have money and the demand for it drops.  The new alternative energy revolution would end our addiction on crude oil, and thus world peace.  Vote Hippy Dave Adam 08 It is like you being in charge!  If we borrow 800B (as they did) and give it to the people instead of those who Messed up to begin with (as they are doing), we will be in charge of our lives again.  If you vote for me I will give you 500 thousand dollars!  We will have the cash to rebuild America, as we see fit to.    I would not change gun issues unless America voted that is what they wanted.

16bfd4d38e8341b3f96f18af75d3b484aa	Good question.  I don't think the majority of Americans would support this.  Most Americans are not as liberal (although I don't know how even liberals could support something as macabre as this) as the most liberal Senator (Obama) is.  This is clearly a murder.  I don't know why people don't think other abortions aren't murder, but this one is so obvious, I don't know how people could, with a clear conscience, vote for this man.  It amazes me what people are able to look past when they're caught up with someone that no one knows hardly anything about.  Wow... Someone just said, "If the 'thing' was supposed to die..."  That makes me sick to my stomach... We've really lost all respect for human life.  I guess we get what we deserve.  And I don't understand the people who say that it's the same as McCain...  McCain is pro-life.|`|7DAIw6XTaa	This is not an important issue to most Americans. McCain has no firm stance on abortion either. Personally, I'm not a fan of the anti-choice lobby, but I can see the merit of both sides. I don't think this issue is the realm of the federal government anyway.    That being said, I think Obama's position is sensible. How can you hold the hospital responsible for the death when the mother came in wanting to have the child aborted? His stance is not to advocate killing infants who survive botched abortions. He is simply absolving the hospital of fault if the baby happens to die after mistakenly being born alive. This makes absolute sense. How could the hospital possibly be responsible for saving a live that someone had them commissioned to terminate?    This is an entirely separate issue than the question over weather abortion should be legal or not. The fact is that abortion IS legal right now, and the reason it is has nothing to do with Obama.    What that legislation means is: A Mother who asks for an abortion, can not sue the hospital if the fetus dies after a botched abortion in which it is deliverd alive. It is simply legislation to stop obviously frivolous lawsuits. If the mother showed up for an abortion (ie she decided to kill the baby) then it's not the hospitals fault if the fetus dies during the killing procedure. She give up her right to sue. It's only logical. It doesn't tell the doctors not to try to save the botched abortion.. It just says they wouldn't be held responsible if the botch abortion doesn't survive.|`|AA11570905	if NObama gets elected it will be one of the worst things to happen to this country in a very long time.

That is clearly defined by science.  Life must meet several criteria. Metabolism, reaction to stimuli, reproduction, and growth.  A sperm or ovum do not meet these criteria, so they are not considered biologically alive. After conception, however, this changes, and you have a new living human organism.    This does not solve the abortion debate, however. Because, as I said, the debate is not about when life begins.  It is about when "personhood" begins. This is a much trickier term, because it is defined philosophically, and not scientifically. So there is no right or wrong, scientifically speaking.    I think Obama defines a person as something after birth (possibly weeks after). Many of his supporters do as well. So from Obama's perspective, it is not infanticide.|`|NNB7qCTcaa	Well probably most of Americans are not going to accept it, but you have to analyze that these babies, at least the majority of them, are going to have severe health problems in the future and they and the parents are going to have lots of suffering... so thats why the doctors let them die...

2X2wjYb4aa	Hi Bronwen,  It's a very good question. If this were the 2000 election, and McCain had received the nomination, I probably would have voted for him. At the time I thought he ran the most mature and dignified campaign (since those seem to be in frightfully short supply these days).   His choice of Governor Palin and the timing of his announcement - the morning following Obama's speech at the DNC - comes across not as a wise, politically astute move; rather, it appears to be a calculated, "we've got to do something big to draw attention away from Obama's speech" maneuver. I'll put it this way: if McCain's goal was to make me MORE likely to vote for him, it didn't work.   As I've indicated in a previous answer (to one of Roxel's questions a couple weeks ago), I continue to lean towards voting for the Libertarian candidate, Bob Barr, provided his name is on the ballot in Massachusetts. The partisans on both sides are running at full throttle, and I've been tired of their bickering and attack-emails and attack ads etc etc etc since the 2004 election.  |`|eQR7c6UOaa	I am still undecided,  with McCain I am sure it will be 4 more years of Bush.  Can our country with stand that?  I don't think so. his choice for VP I do not believe was a very good one.  He chose Palin I believe because she was a woman.  If our votes really counted Hillary would be in Obama's place right now.  Voting for Obama is very scary too. Have you read any of his books he has written.  here are some of his statements from his books  From Dreams of My Father:'I ceased to advertise my mother's race at the age of 12 or 13, when I began to suspect that by doing so I was ingratiating myself to whites.'   From Dreams of My Father : 'I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race.'   From Dreams of My Father:'There was something about him that made me wary, a little too sure of himself, maybe. And white.'   From Dreams of My Father: 'It remained necessary to prove which side you were on, to show your loyalty to the black masses, to strike out and name names.'   From Dreams of My Father:'I never emulate white men and brown men whose fates didn't speak to my own. It was into my father's image, the black man, son of Africa , that I'd packed all the attributes I sought in myself , the attributes of Martin and Malcolm, DuBois and Mandela.'      And FINALLY the Most Damning one of ALL of them!!!  From Audacity of Hope:'I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction.'  Our country is in for big trouble if either one gets in to office.    |`|8T7HOi8xaa	im voting for shrek. both choices are douchebags.

The above does not augur well for his campaign for the above reason.Also Rep Kaptur is running for reelection in a heavily Democratic district so it would be difficult for Joe to win on the GOP ticket.

That's their purpose.  Corporations are going where the business atmosphere is better.  Why should they stay in the US to be over-regulated and over-taxed?  Then after paying all of the taxes and jumping through all of the hoops that we set up for them, they must then listen to people saying how greedy and evil they are if they make a profit and the threats of our government to take more of their profits.  Add to that the fact that if they stay in the US they are taking a risk of losing their business to some frivolous lawsuit.  The US is the most litigious country in the world.    We can't expect our corporations to have loyalty to us when we don't show them that same kind of loyalty.  We can't say to them, "You're evil and greedy---now show your patriotism and give me a good job loaded with benefits".|`|BjQcwGSLaa	not really|`|2vtP7WS7aa	China has offered to permit US corporations to move over there and have a tax free existence.  So much for Obama saving the economy!|`|sa1JGWSkaa	No.      Patriotism is dedication to your country and willingness to make personal sacrifices to sustain its principles.    Job outsourcing is an element of the global economy, which is supposed to be mutually exclusive of nationalism.  Admittedly, many people see things differently.|`|g5FbtzNTaa	I think you're a little left of center on this one.     A major reason corporations leave the US or even out source to other nations is for various and unnecessary reasons.    The entitlement mentality taught in schools jades students into thinking they should get paid $7-$10 hr. for entry level positions.    Federal interference (regulations) in corporations leverages too much tax on the company to make any kind of profit that would enable the company to reinvest in its self and creat more jobs.    >>>>>I remarked to that citizen of India: "So you're one of those folks who is taking American jobs, not paying American federal or state income tax, social security tax or buying American products."  He just chuckled back into the phone.  It wasn't his fault.    >>>>>"We're literally bleeding jobs left and right--in all sectors of the economy and the country, most of our senators and representatives could hardly care--not even talking about the personal security risks of having foreignors having access to the private financial information of American citizens......    Example: Haliburton, Bank One, Intel and more.|`|V2hIqNd9aa	Definately.  Take it from me.  These Republican cronies talk to us about being patriots and supporting our government, bla, bla, bla.  They sit their and don't give a damn about us.  All they care about is the quick buck.  We've had enough of these corporate cheerleaders.    The only jobs left in this country are the jobs that have to be done here. ie. Service jobs.|`|tdFhxIgXaa	1|`|L2QdPvSUaa	The job of a corporation is to make a reasonably good profit to please its shareholders, not to be a blind patriot.|`|AA11367901	Obama will cause people to pay more when he taxes the rich.

Cases in point: Mankato, Minnesota and Minot, South Dakota both have thriving tech support call center industries and the cost is VERY low.    Plus, Mankato is where they have the statue of the Jolly Green Giant.  Seriously, no kidding!|`|s8H3hWxBaa	Yes, and it has been going on for years, especially since NAFTA.

George Bush, Dick Cheney, John McCain and company they all want these lovely CEO's and corporations to keep on doing what they have been for the last 8 years. They want to keep giving them tax breaks while they outsource the jobs to other countries. Have you ever tried speaking to some of these people working for the companies in the other countries OMG I can't even understand them! This is so sad and really a gross display of Anti-Americanism if I ever saw one! I just can't get over how many rediculous people are blind by the smear tactics of the RNC and McCain/Palin ticket! Nothing will change if these two idiots are elected! Obama will give "tax Breaks" to companies who create jobs and keep them in the USA. Obama will give tax breaks to 95% of Working people! Do not believe the crap this campaign is slinging at our tv sets! Its a desperate attempt to get votes and/or discourage votes....How many people really make over $250,000 per year...NOT MANY....Obama/biden will help the middle and lower class and ONLY change the tax brackets back to what it was under Ronald Reagan for the remaining people lucky enough to earn over $250,000. WAKE UP America its time to take the blinders off and really see whats best for this country.

You can't tax the hell out of companies and expect them to stay here!  I sure as hell wouldn't and you wouldn't either.  The less taxes we have the better for all of us.  Economics 101|`|A4vc2Dg9aa	Many companies in North America have been sold and are controlled by foreign interests. These new owners owe nothing to Americans and so have no qualms about ordering the offshoring of jobs.     Few manufacturing companies left on this continent are wholly American-owned, and the financial industry is in effect owned by the Federal Reserve, which is actually a private bank that is owned by foreign banks.    The objective of the foreign elites that now own America is to strip her of wealth and power so that she shall become their vassal-state.
bQLQdRBZaa	Yes--I think it will get worse.    And maybe that's a good thing.  Decent Americans have wanted to believe that racism was all but dead in our country--as what real American would not?  But, while the hate and bigotry is in decline, it is by no means eradicated.    And the racists among us have sued our decency against us--with claims tha twe "don't need affirmative action," that "there's no more discrimination," and so on. We've often been lulled into believing their lies because we wanted to.    Now--we are getting our noses rubbed in the facts. We've made fantasstic progress--and can be proud that Americans are willing to elect an African-American to the Presidency. That says a lot--all good--about how far we've come.    But we aren't thee yet. We are not yet to the point where, as Dr. King said, people are truely "judged by the content of their characer, not the color of their skin."    And the sooner we accept that, the sooner we can make even more progress. The racists are doing us a favor, I think: They are reminding us that they--and their evil--still infects our society and that they still are a threat to America. It's not their intent to alert America to the danger they represent, but warning us they are. Take heed.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, because as they get more desperate, they will display their racism even more. For two reasons, to smear Obama some more, and  because of anger and bitterness Incidentally, Rev. Wright was more right than wrong. He exposed racism in the USA, and that's why so many of them hate him, and try to smear Obama, via guilt by associatin, although this will not work OBAMA 2008 !|`|AA12045802	No it will get better.|`|c14d59914c10e59234c623e16b572f1eaa	One word      WRIGHT      Read it and weep|`|g2idZEKFaa	No the KKK will not show up at his rallies   .  Not yet anyway  .  |`|jLaDJYJRaa	It seems to me that Obama supporters are the racists as they are the ones who keep calling out racism and playing the race card.|`|Fv8C8ysNaa	Rev. Wright was correct?  So you want God to damn America?|`|4c7xJ7oXaa	Hmmm maybe Rev. Wright was talking about Biden?    "You cannot go into a Dunkin' Donuts or a 7-Eleven unless you have a slight Indian accent."    "My state was a slave state. My state is a border state. My state has the eighth largest black population in the country. My state is anything [but] a Northeastern liberal state."     "I mean, you got the first mainstream African American [Barack Obama] who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy."     "There's less than 1% of the population of Iowa that is African American. There is probably less than 4% or 5% that is, are minorities. What is it in Washington? So look, it goes back to what you start off with, what you're dealing with."  Sen.

They don't want to talk about race. And they don't want to understand what 'racism' really is:    'Racism, by its simplest definition, is the belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race.'  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racism    Rev Wright isn't a 'racist', but merely 'one who complains about the racist history of American whites'. I would like to see an example of Wright claiming that blacks are superior to whites.

I guess I gave them too much credit for having a brain.  I am smart enough to know not all Republicans are racists, but what makes me angry are the ones that are, and how they feign their bias is for another reason.

It's your imagination.    Liberals will always create racism if they need it, and this is no different.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Look, some people are racist.

Obama is bad news.    He sat for over twenty years in the church of his choice with his friend the Reverend Wright.  How much, "God Damn America" and "white people have the potential to be human beings" and praise be to Farrakhan, can he pretend he did not hear, or did not believe?    He titled his book after Wright's sermon, he had Wright bless his Tony Rezco house and chriStian his children.  He uses Cone's black theologian ministry and thinks he believes it is CHRISTIANITY!   When Wright is outed it is revealed that they had an agreement that they would have to "distance" themselves for a while.  He expresses his love for Islam in his books and the leaders of all of the Islamic terrorist nations sing his praises and are probably financing his campaign  AND YOU WONDER WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE UNEASY WITH THIS GUY IN THE WHITE HOUSE?|`|7ny2EjjHaa	why not?!

Ohhh, and if in fact he did give thousands of dollars to Farakan, then, yes, I consider him aiding a terrorist.   |`|I3nlLVuzaa	Sarah Palin is playing a role and trying to get to the white house.  She is unethical and will do what ever it takes.|`|sYi4PM1eaa	I think there are at least two reasons for this tactic. The first reason is to take eyes off of her relationship with a known terrorist. The other reason is because they don't have a leg to stand on with any other accusation so figure why not give this one a try. No one is dirt free especially politicians but if you research mccain and palin you will find plenty of dirt. After reading up on Gov. Palin I actually shook in my socks. This woman has reason or right to say anything about another person.

Obama / Biden 08!!!!!!!!!|`|L3TsGv30aa	     Yes, in 3 weeks time he based his entire foreign policy on Palins insightful advice. |`|WzsdjtPFaa	 Thats what he said......just like he said the war was over, deregulation for banks is the best, we've solved the bailout, I promise to love you forever(to his first wife), I attend all congress voting(worst attendance), I am for the people(tax breaks for the wealthy), the economy is strong, etc......|`|sLI6ry1raa	This is getting kookier by the day|`|IX6dQdP0aa	McCain lost it, which is better than Palin cos she never had it in the first place :D|`|t5zFlzdkaa	She can see Russia from her house!!!!

iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, and to provide further information, abut El Salvador on of the leaders of WACL, was Major Roberto D'Aubisson, a CIA trained agent, who was the leader of death squads , which murdered archbishop Romero, as well as numerous opponents including nuns and priests. This group was also involved with East European fascists, including Ukrainian leader Lev Dobriansky, whose daughter Paula,was Assistant Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration.So it can be said that by associating with this group Mc SAME has blood on his hand|`|BsQcplTQaa	How about links to evidence proving the accusation? Is he a member of this group now? Does this have any relevance to the current presidential election? |`|LgKYrup2aa	Doesn't surprise me    At least three of McCain's GOP colleagues have gone on record to say that they consider him temperamentally unsuited to be commander in chief.     GOP Bob Smith, the former senator from New Hampshire, has said that McCain's "temper would place this country at risk in international affairs, and the world perhaps in danger. In my mind, it should disqualify him."     Sen. Domenici of New Mexico has said he doesn't "want this guy anywhere near a trigger."     And Sen. Thad Cochran of Mississippi weighed in that "the thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He is erratic. He is hotheaded."    |`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	Do you know about the unsavory connections to Obama?

McCain's background would be a great issue if Obama was not such a Gentleman and rather discuss issues than dirt, real dirt. And if Palin had any brains, she would read and inform herself before she opens her big mouth and steps into it big time. But then also who says that she is ethical. We now have it black on white that she it not.  |`|iEqp1qICaa	It is true.|`|aPFrb44naa	so he is not a muslim
AA10188579	I was an undecided voter.  I don't like the way either candidate wants to handle the economy.  One does not know what will happen and the other wants to spend the country into the ground.    All I can say is this...I have been threatened with physical harm if I decide to vote for Obama.  Not to mention the verbal abuse if I question his record.  I am not talking a healthy exchange.    As a result, I have decided to vote for McCain.  No more threats.  I want it to stop. AND!  The last time I checked I live in a democracy.  I HAVE THE FREEDOM to vote as I wish with no intimidation.  Intimidation is against the LAW!    After voting for 20 years +, I have never seen anything like this.  What is happening to this country?|`|dFAcGubraa	McCain, because I don't like Obama and the DNC and Obama know that Obama isnt a natural born US citizen. When the courts rule against Obama in the lawsuit, the game will be up and Hillary will take Obama's place. The bad part is that it may cause irreparable damage to my beloved Democrat party.|`|AA10899250	Neither. I believe in the Constitution.|`|Yw1hoH05aa	I'm voting for John McCain. I support smaller government, low taxes, and pro-gun rights.|`|PYmdmuw8aa	Oh ye of little faith nether one is worth a damn. So my answer is no to both.|`|AA11765876	Obama as he is tolerant, open minded, charismatic, intelligent, not a racist and reasonable. He has also held his head up high despite the open lynch mob rallies where people are shouting "off with his head" "obama is a terrorist" I have to say that I would have lost it and retaliated but no Obama has more class and culture then I could ever display. I am so impressed with him. He has the viewpoints that there can be communication with our world leaders prior to just threatening as a republican would do and has done and look at our world now. What we do affects the entire world so I want a leader that can think beyong his EGO and Obama does. I think that is the major thing here EGO Obama is strong and McCain reacts by EGO. McCains rallies have stunned saddened and disgusted me. He has provoked the obvious racists in the rallies to just about go out and kill Obama. That is so so so so so wrong and very scary. God help us with those in power. But Obama is so far ahead, intelligence has won out. He is our new President and frankly I love him already.|`|QnkiJga8aa	Obama  He'll be a change and that's what are country needs right now.

If he is not able to show Obama any respect at all, it makes me wonder how he will relate to the rest of the world during negotiations.  I have a feeling it is his way or no way.  NO NEGOTIATIONS!  Just my opinion, bring on the thumbs down.|`|3tLW7fZQaa	MrLinx: Thats because McCain came out and called your state a communist state...dead serious...the news media was like wtf...heh    last I heard, WV was typically a red state.  but ya...that seriously hurt him over there when he said that...|`|OcnsptnPaa	He needs to get more aggressive about Obama and tell the American people about all the corruption in the Obama campaign.

INyf9Ar4aa	 it wasn't Bushs plan it was congress' plan remember they didn't like Bushs plan it didn't have any perks for their friends...I would have to call it the Obama/McCain plan if I were going to blame someone:-)  well I guess it really it would have to be called the Obama/Bush/McCain plan...    Obama first because he was given the credit that "he wanted" for getting the bill passed and he is the leader( kind of sort of) of the democrat party at this time and they are the ones that got the bill pushed through he could have swayed the out come by standing against the bill...     Bush second because he is our president...the president of the people of the USA and he was for this bill he started it and then he signed it...I put him second because he will be out in a couple months  and chances are Obama will be in...Obama knowing that pushed for this bill...    McCain third because he can at lest admit he is not an economist(have we ever had a president that was an economist?)...and because of all three he is truly the only person that ever did anything to try to stop this but was blocked in the committee by the democrats...  always nosnod    |`|wz9szz3Gaa	Why are you associating McCain with Bush when Obama voted more times with Bush then McCain and it was a democratic bailout Paulson is a democrat!!!!!!!!!!!|`|JxYLnTGiaa	IF you mean too late for the election..

Unfortunately, they believed there was nothing wrong with the corruption pointed out by investigators into Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, so they blocked all avenues of regulation and reform. Bush is now trying to fix what his Administration warned us about way back in 2001.  That was about the same time the Administration was warning us about the looming Energy crisis. But, Congressional Democrats thwarted those efforts as well!

Everyday that they go after Obama instead of the economic problems we're facing, people will start to tune them out.  Heck, most people I know, even  republicans, are tuning them out already.    Most people are sick of the diversions, and the one thing that will get them to pay attention and take a good look at the candidates is by talking about what's going on with THEIR money.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Dino get off this band wagon of right and wrong when will democrats take responsibility for anything . These are truths if Obama wins it will be in the courts for months do to his affiliation with Acorn and the republicans will have every right!!!! Obama is a wolf in sheep's clothing you are all so blind!
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	You love aggressive Republican women, and don't try to deny it.|`|AA10329269	No, because Obama quickly follows with his own "attack ads." For instance, the William Ayers issue - Obama has already created a Keating 5 counter-attack ad. So it pretty much makes it a wash. If Obama could stick to being "above" this type of thing, then McCain's ads would be political suicide....but Obama just can't resist throwing the mud back.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, they will, because independent and even smarter GOP voters are looking for a campaign designed to resolve issues and not just a plain old smear campaign. The GOP is an insult to people's intelligence.|`|idlv3TAdaa	yes. And I know one thing is for CERTAIN...Sarah Palin has UNDERESTIMATED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.|`|PtHThRoNaa	It's already starting.

Obama is a dog and is about to be exposed.|`|RqeHygq1aa	yep have you seen the polls|`|AA10168935	Yes they will. You know the saying about people living in glass houses. For every attempt at a smear they try against Obama, there's tons more actual things to throw back their way.|`|zrHLiU0Faa	Yes, look how well their other attack ads went over! So well he had to pull them from the air and doesn't like to talk about them! If people haven't bought the lies about Obama thus far - they aren't going to! People want health care they want an answer to the economy - what does McCain do? Does he say "here is the plan, I have the answer, trust in me" no, he says "Obama is a danger to your security!" Booga booga - the problem is fear ain't selling like it used to.    I for one, do love aggressive smart women, when they are telling the truth. They have to be smart though.|`|AA11672679	John McCain would probably be doing  better if he had not used such low-down tactics to gain popularity and votes.  Adding Sarah Palin to his ticket was the worst mistake.  He will sink faster than the Titanic.|`|iUMWEpDIaa	The short response would be: Yes, they will and they already have.     The explanation is longer, though: The McCain campaign is dragging behind in the polls and in some cases is simply giving up campaigning in areas which are already considered lost (Michigan is an example of this).     The sense of crisis calls for drastic means and this have led the campaign to use slander and insinuation in order to scare voters from voting for Obama, and supporters are following up, e.g. The Judicial Confirmation Network (http://judicialnetwork.com/). The republicans have done so before, and especially Karl Rove has been renown for this kind of tactics. The logic is simple: The attack doesn't have to bee based on facts, because fear alone will be enough to move voters from Obama to McCain - especially if the word "terror" is used. As an example, the McCain campaign has been trying to associate Obama with Bill Ayers, even though New York Times have brought a story which basically says that they never have been close.    So it seems that the best kind of insinuation is that which is only based on half/not proven rumors...|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Obama and Biden said last week they were going after McCain so what's good for the goose is good for the gander. Obama's affiliation with terrorist is very true that is why Obama is saying no comment. This is scary stuff Obama is sunk!|`|cPuicv06aa	Absolutely!  What is going on this morning with the smear campaign from them is just making me sick!  |`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Yes. Nothing can save Palin/McCain, though.

As Stanley Kurtz has reported, ACORN proudly touted "affirmative action" lending and pressured banks to make subprime loans. Madeline Talbott, a Chicago ACORN leader, boasted of "dragging banks kicking and screaming" into dubious loans. And, as Sol Stern reported in City Journal, ACORN also found a remunerative niche as an "advisor" to banks seeking regulatory approval. "Thus we have J.P. Morgan & Co., the legatee of the man who once symbolized for many all that was supposedly evil about American capitalism, suddenly donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to ACORN." Is this a great country or what? As conservative community activist Robert Woodson put it, "The same corporations that pay ransom to Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton pay ransom to ACORN."    ACORN attracted Barack Obama in his youthful community organizing days. Madeline Talbott hired him to train her staff -- the very people who would later descend on Chicago's banks as CRA shakedown artists. The Democratic nominee later funneled money to the group through the Woods Fund, on whose board he sat, and through the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, ditto. Obama was not just sympathetic -- he was an ACORN fellow traveler.    Now you could make the case that before 2008, well-intentioned people were simply unaware of what their agitation on behalf of non-credit-worthy borrowers could lead to. But now? With the whole financial world and possibly the world economy trembling and cracking like a cement building in an earthquake, Democrats continue to try to fund their friends at ACORN? And, unashamed, they then trot out to the TV cameras to declare "the party is over" for Wall Street (Nancy Pelosi)? The party should be over for the Democrats who brought us to this pass. If Obama wins, it means hiring an arsonist to fight a fire.  This group is responsible for the mess we are in today and Obama was there lawyer. They have multiple voter fraud felonies in all most every state all in the name of democrats!!!!!! Please get off the band wagon accusing McCain of deplorable acts open your ears or read something democrats no little of.  |`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	LOL... dont count your chickens....

I find it a big joke and so does the nation to see Nancy Pelosi saying republicans are unpatriotic during the signing of the bailout because they did not like the bill it favored the democrats. Pelosi used the platform to make a partisan political ploy to make Obama look good and Obama was the biggest receiver in the Fannie Mae scandal.

If your mind is not made up by now it's not going to be unless u flip a coin (I hope people won't do that.) But nothing can change people's minds at this point unless you're an undecided. Just go out and vote for the man you want and sit and wait for the results. That's how I'm looking at it now|`|6JQUIZFTaa	Yes, they do.    Palin was well vetted and has a favorability record of over 80 percent with the Democrats and Republicans in her state of Alaska.  The radical left has sensationalized many things about her, which are simply lies.  A.  Although the McCain camp has not vetted Joe, the plumber, it appears that your camp has not done a thorough job.  He is not a licensed plumber, but works as a plumber, under his company's license.  One does not have to have an individual license to work in the plumbing field, as long as there is a company license.  B.  Since Joe has not announced what his income is, then you could not possibly know whether or not or how he plans on buying that business.  Perhaps he knows more about that than you do.  C.  The Joe that is listed on the internet is the Joe that owes the taxes.  It is not Joe, the plumber.  When one owes taxes, the name that is used must be their full given name, as it appears on their social security card.  Joe is a nickname, not his first name.  D.  The same goes for child support payments, so scratch this one off your list too.  He was not called by McCain, as he was found by a reporter at an Obama function, not a McCain function.  Obviously, without his real name, they could not call Joe.  No one could have reached him by using the first name of Joe.  McCain is not just concerned with the middle class, but rather all of the classes.  Obama is pandering to the middle class, as he learned to do that by studying the teachings of Saul Alinsky, a radical Marxist that lived during the 1930's-1972.  Saul taught that the poor did not have the power, so one must cater to the middle class, which is how Obama has been running his campaign.  Both Obama and Saul are Marxists.    What gives anyone the right to post lies about another person on the internet....and why don't people research these things?|`|hGssSehnaa	i think they just get their advice from one of those palm readers because they sure look like a bunch of dummies...........

I truly believe that many of the people who are going to vote for him are basing their decision on mainstream media sound-bites and slogans like "Hope and Change". The level of ignorance I see all around me is staggering (I live in a liberal city so it shouldn't surprise me). Thank God for conservative talk radio and conservative bloggers such as Michelle Malkin, Matt Drudge and others who are trying to educate people. More folks should read conservative columnists.

At the same time they have run roughshod over civil rights and the Constitution, and to top it off failed to adequately regulate financial markets, which has led to the credit and housing collapse, and allowed a few greedy corporations and individuals to make obscene, tax-free profits at he expense of the nation as a whole. Throw in unchecked environmental degradation and the insidious introduction of religion into national policy and you have the worst presidency in our history.    Congress gets a share of the blame.  They don't have the guts to stand up to the White House, or do what they were elected to do: act in the interest of the nation as a whole rather than  being yes-men for whatever special interest group they think will help get them re-elected.

They consist of a large number of separate clans, states, and cultural ethnic groups. During the 15th to the 19th centuries, their people were ruined by dislocation and illness brought in European civilization. In the early 21st century, Native American groups continued to be a permanent fixture in the American economy and in the lives of Native Americans. Communities have constantly shaped governments that manage services like firefighting, biological conservation, and legal implementation. Most Native American clans have developed court structures to arbitrate issues related to native rules. Gambling has become a dominant industry. The income is utilized to construct varied economies.

My husband and I make under $200K a year combined, and last year we paid $4500 in income taxes on top of what was taken out of our checks - nice! The year before that we paid around $1200 in additional income taxes. Under the Obama plan we will actually get a refund of around $500. A REFUND!! Money in our pocket, albeit, not that much, but I would rather get $500 then pay $4500. I also would like to point out that taxing my healthcare, would likely put me into a higher tax bracket - which would be a TAX INCREASE to me, and take more money out of my pocket. Do the math people, before you go to the polls do the basic simple math.    People that think their tax dollars are coming straight from their pocket and getting redistributed to the poor are missing a big piece of the puzzle here - tax dollars pay for wars, schools, police, firefighters, parks, libraries, highway repairs, building of infrastructure, national security, the military, etc... these are things all people use rich and poor, it's not a redistribution of anything, it's reality. Not to mention someone pulling in $250K a year is bringing home over $20,000  a month, Obama's tax increase for this bracket is 3% or $625 a month. Are you seriously telling me that somebody that is making $20,000 a month or more can not afford to pay an extra 3% in taxes? Gimme a break, that's a drop in the bucket|`|xxDjV6Axaa	That statement is laughable!  As he sits in his $2M home and Biden sits in his $6M one.  Spread whose wealth?  Good for who?

iVv6bFW2aa	I don't see any good in the Bush administration, except possibly one thing, covering some medicines under Medicare. The plan is very limited, but perhaps it can be a foot in the door in our goal of Universal Government ran medication and health insurance. The bad of Bush's administration has too many examples to list. However they include, the invasion of Afghanistan, the war in Iraq, siding with Georgia in the case of Abkhazia, and Southern Ossetia, corruption, both in the Departments of Justice and Defense, veto of bill to increase health insurance for children, anti worker policies ,appointment of a reactionary Supreme Court,  erosion of civil liberties by spying, cruel immigration  policies , and general incompetence and partisanship. All of these action call for impeachment and imprisonment|`|fBvhkalFaa	The good.  National security.  The bad.  Staying in Iraq too long.

Neither has helped anything.|`|8c1a7d74e1a9bd82b06628aba8b6b6e5aa	I think he has done a good job.     The major criticisms are that he failed to heed John McCain's requests for more troops and removal of Donald Rumsfeld who was not on-board with doing what must-be done in order to have a successful occupation strategy. Unlike many though, I think Bush did the right thing in going beyond attacking the Taliban, which would've been an insufficient response to 9-11, since Al Qaeda was destined to divorce itself from the Taliban and re-emerge elsewhere to launch attacks against us. By attacking Iraq, we sucked the oxygen out of the support network for terrorist and engaged Al Qaeda in a battle there and defeated them.    Secondly he failed to do more---go beyond stern warnings---to stop the Democrats and a few Republicans from pushing Fannie Mae inito the aggresive strategy of offering home loans to those who could not afford them.|`|f78a09d74478afe45b3d67bbb7b70f51aa	I have no opinion, I have blocked the past 8 years out of my mind completely.

kALPhOJVaa	Hi:    I'm not one of those white supremacists you were hoping to hear from (to answer your question).  In fact:  My racial make up is exactly the same as Barack Obama's.    Let me say this about white racists and this election season:  They are divided into 2 groups.  One group will NEVER vote for a black person under any circumstances.  Even if their survival depended on it.  They simply can't bring themselves to vote for a black person.    Then there's another group I've been hearing about.  They don't like black people but are not SO ignorant as to vote against their own best interests.  They vote with their wallets.  This economic disaster we are currently in is having a sobering effect on those white people in that they look at the two candidates and come to the logical conclusion that Barack Obama has a better plan for saving their jobs than does John McCain.  They will "close their eyes" on election day and forget that Barack Obama wheres brown skin.  Tells you how desperate the times really are.    As for black people:  We just want the same chances to excel and succeed as has been given to white people since we've been freed from slavery.  We're not interested in "revenge".  We're interested in justice, social justice and economic justice.  A President Barack Obama will bring about policies that will benefit ALL Americans; not just black Americans.  Those racists who hate black people simply because their skin color is different will always live in fear and ignorance.  They will never be converted.  All we can do is evolve our minds and hearts beyond such hatred AND outlive the racists.  Hopefully they will fade away into history.|`|ZXUOHGVsaa	I think he will enslave the white race...|`|k059fnv3aa	no where all americans|`|4hfwXY5eaa	idk but there is segration in most people.I dont mind if theres a black president but idk how to answer this|`|EY5gGx3faa	heh! wouldn't that be something eh! Prolly not. We're not stupid. If he did that sh!t, we'd throw him out on his @ss and bootf*ck him!    Besides, i never disrespected any black people. You're talking about the collective actions of a bunch of old f*cks.|`|QLRf9Dzbaa	I think you have it wrong.  Obama will be extra hard on all the black people to prove to whitey that he deserves the job.  Maybe Obama won't be so bad after all...|`|TD9T9dNlaa	Since day-one, white men have held all the real power in the US---and they are scared crapless having a black man take the reins from them----its that simple     and for the historical record, Canada never had racism or segregation|`|cd0b3bbd8df141c2851cdda176199d30aa	You must be joking...  I'm not voting for him not cause he's black. My moms boyfriend is black, One of my best friends is black. I could care less what color he was. |`|LwMV2RMvaa	I'm more scared that BLACK hate groups will attack Obama.

Is a six-year-old running for president, or an Ivy League educated man?  |`|Aorij1Ptaa	LOL!  That's probably what it is.  I believe fear of the black man is the only obstacle for Obama.  He's going to win though.  Oh Jesus, please let him win.|`|9f6145035ea01ea2c407cae99bafc561aa	I could care less about having a black President.    Now do I want a president from a political party that has caused the genocide of tens of millions of blacks in the Untied States and that idolizes their pro slavery past by using the political symbol of the Nations only slave trading President, Andrew "jacka*s" Jackson (D).     By the way, Andrew Jackson is the best documented 1/4 Black President.|`|F8OT1iD8aa	Yes my mom doesn't like to go into black neighborhoods and always tell's me to watch out and doesn't like me going anywhere near them|`|F92FDQGEaa	I have never owned a slave however I've had to pay high taxes all my life to support all kinds of black entitlements. |`|7qRFw5fjaa	Quite actually, most black politicians are harder on blacks than their white counterparts.  Black neighborhoods feel that it is a black problem, they resent outside help from white politicians.  Unfortunately, not many politicians,(of any color) follow through with their promises.|`|LCqL6Z2laa	I thought Democrats were the party of unity and you talk like this?|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	No, and if he did, i'm sure it would fall under one of the impeachment articles.  But you need to go back and read my friend. America treated the black people horrible ? Perhaps a little worse off than most other ethinic backgrounds, but I"m sure the Japanese American's didn't like staying in our camps during WW2, I'm sure that the Native America's didn't like the troubles in the 40's and 50's. I'm sure that women didn't treasure having to march and win the right to vote.  The truth is, despite our founding fathers bringing forth a great nation, they came with the preconceived idea's from where they were from.  BUT, the great thing about America is that we dared to stand against the world in their old views regarding voting, freedom, civil rights. We led the charge on many of these issues and made the change.  You want to whine about slavery, how about blame the people that started it. Europe.  You have to know history if you want to point fingers.  |`|f6Qad0usaa	I haven't treated blacks badly and neither has anybody I know.        Channon Christian and Christopher Newsome treated blacks badly by getting blood on their floor and feces on their junk I guess.  Horrible white people.    I've never thought of blacks collectively as my enemy but I do have a burning hatred for people like you.  May you meet the egalitarian end that those two kids in Knoxville did.|`|36bTrxHfaa	I'm not scared of him at all. He seems like a kind, level-headed, very smart man, and no, he's not going to start a war on white people. What a ridiculous question. I see his being black as a good thing. He's coming from a different place than all these white, stuffy old men. He's been through things that us white folks can't imagine, and he knows what needs to be done to help reduce racism, and find equality for all. I can't wait for his inauguration. And I bet that so many of you frightened white conservatives might be so pleased with the job he does and the dramatic swing for good our country takes in the next 4 years, that you might even vote him in for another 4.|`|4TEccywKaa	You are entitled to dislike my policies. I understand that people have differing opinions. That's why we vote. However, I am not a racist. I will not treat white people any differently than black people. It is quite racist to even think that I would do such a thing. Look, I was born in 1961. Martin Luther King, Jr. made his "I have a dream" speech in 1963. I spent much of my childhood in Indonesia. I have absolutely nothing against white people.|`|QX5IcarCaa	oh sure ignore the Native Americans the Irish Scotch immigrants, the Chinese immigrants, every one of those groups has been treated like crap . the reason you don't hear about it very much is because they got over it, what's in the past is in the past  and the US has a much longer history of being even more horrid to the native Americans  i'm not saying that what has happened should be pushed away, i'm just saying that there is a major misconception about this whole thing  i've got quite a few really good black friends and i've seen more racism coming from blacks aimed at me then the other way around, and those black friends of mine, they've noticed it to   and i don't care what he or any one else says Oboma isn't black. just look at him|`|AA11827582	I never did anything to the African-American race... and in school I had to do a search on my ancestors and found out that my Great Great.......

My mother raised me in a very accepting and aware environment. LONG before it was PC.    Trout...  Great Thread!    Edit:     I think there is a lot of truth in your question Trout. This issue runs so deep that I honestly think that some people have been surprised at what has risen to the surface. That is scary for anybody. A lot of the answers here show that.  Otherwise you wouldn't have gotten so much anger thrown your way. But you just keep on... you bring a lot of much needed grey matter to these discussions.|`|AVc1PCu5aa	Policies.

Obama's color doesn't scare me because hes just meat like the rest of us.  Its the policies that do indeed scare me.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Well.. since he went to a Black Liberation Theology church, there is some reason to be concerned that he might not be fair. But I wouldn't say I'm afraid of him. What concerns me more is his bent towards socialism. He believes healthcare is a right. He believes in direct transfer of money from the rich to the poor rather than programs that will help all. His foreign policy is embarrassingly naeive. I could go on and on. He seems to have a very far left past, and no sign that he has changed. So if you are a socialist or marxist, you might not have a problem, but I'm a capitalist, so it's problematic. |`|rzkdrI6waa	Your presumption is that I've treated blacks poorly.    How DARE you do that?  What I am and what YOU should be afraid of is what Obama will do to this country.    I will NOT vote for Obama, just the same way I didn't vote for Carter or Clinton.

Hey, Jim,  I'm Sicilian too - the beautiful people.|`|L6xakeAtaa	Well, I have never treated anyone badly because of their race. But I understand your question and where it's coming from. I do agree that blacks have been treated badly, there is no denying that. Some whites will come on here and say otherwise, but in their hearts they know it's true. And I do know that every race have dealt with discrimination before, but blacks have dealt with it way more than any other race and everyone knows it. I'm not the type of white person to deny it because it's true. And it's sad to say but it still exist...my co workers can treat black people so rudely sometimes, and I ask them like wat the f**k was that? And they'll say 'what?' like they didn't do anything...The bottom line is I feel you dude. I agree 100% with you.|`|9ChD0d9xaa	Yes, it is really just his policies.    I think a black president would be great! But Obama's not the one.     The so-called "long history" is well...history.    Mis-treatment of blacks today is rare (and harshly punished). It's ignorant people like you that divide people.     I have never intentionally treated anyone poorly, and if i did it wouldn't be because of there race. You are a disgrace to humanity to assume that all white people hate black people.  It's ignorant people like you that divide people.

Nor is my family.     And we have had direct cause to deal with the State of California Department of Homeland Security. Not a big deal in the big scheme of things, but ridiculous none the less.    But something to consider is this:    If we weren't Natives (5th generation American) and I wasn't born and raised a California Girl, maybe I would be more fearful to question them? Maybe precisely because I have enjoyed the privileges and protections of being an American, I do not fear questioning them?     Tho I do fear what they represent.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	good question, trout i would be afraid to question homeland security  and i probably would equate them with the gestapo but are afraid  to say it.|`|YYLtqZqnaa	No, they keep me safe. |`|61xKM07Oaa	I don't even know what they do...my family came to this country when i was 2 years old and when i passed my driving test i never got my actual license.

Good point|`|SSLekPAnaa	Did these 'predatory lenders' force 'victims' to sign these mortgages? Why should they be bailed out for one cent? |`|AA11995584	The fact is this whole crisis started as a result of the banks being forced by predatory democrats whose goal is to rob from those who have earned and give to those that have not. These banks were forced to lend to people who did not meet loan qualifications, and who had no intention or history of repayment.. |`|l02Huqdlaa	And how is that going to prevent this from happening again? Give people who don't use common sense and the ability to stay within their means a bailout and they will do it again. I'm sorry but people have to get their acts together or this will keep on happening.|`|pOJ8G7Sgaa	Because no one forced them to take a debt that they couldn't pay.|`|AA10667433	Because the victims don't provide credit for businesses to make payroll, or send kids to college, or for car purchases.  The banks do.  If the banks can't do that, we will ALL suffer. |`|t9c4vOZmaa	right and they should but of course if they did that they would not be able to steal money and put it in their pockets. |`|AA11221532	Because then the wall street would lose their parachute and China would cash in the debt we owe them.  WAMU CEO worked 3 weeks - got 18 million dollars.  Do we really need to bail a company out that can afford to do that?|`|aa4a4e068156f41134975a07e89ab28faa	Well, for me, I think it makes way more sense to force these companies lower the interest rates for the folks facing foreclosure so they can afford their loans.  That would stabilize the market and help everyone.  So far, this hasn't been mentioned and I don't understand why. |`|AA12372498	Wow. I think you are on to something. What a great idea. I bet BOTH parties can agree on this.|`|ODoccxeraa	Where would you start??? What about the people that have already lost their houses and that have been sold??? AND where do you draw the line, just bail out the people in foreclosure, or include the people that are within months of foreclosure, or just cut a check for everyone with a home loan for $xxxx... The housing crisis is only one issue, there is a LOT of corruption out there and it has finally caught some people by the @zz and they want $$$ to get them out of the mess they either contributed to or enjoyed the fruits of... NO BAILOUT...|`|jONUTIjFaa	Because they're not the ones our economy is riding on?    Anyways, why should we bail them out? They signed their loans, they didn't read them. Everything that's done to these people was done in the fine print of a contract, shame on them for not reading.    Now, in the same respect, we shouldn't be bailing out these companies that did it, but to be fair, we're not 'bailing them out' more than we are 'keeping the economy afloat'. (Well, trying to at least)|`|s5r5frV0aa	I agree.|`|0Mq84bDYaa	There should be some help for them, but the credit market needs to be stabilized, so that business can stay open and pay their employees.|`|GFdppnFHaa	The "victims" are as much to blame as the lenders in this situation.   Both were incredibly irresponsible.   The real victims are the taxpayers.|`|5vVMsmkqaa	Because those CEO's need their severance pays....    Time to put up some stop signs and traffic signals on Wall Street.|`|doQAWBE2aa	Because that make too much sense. That would be the logical and responsible thing to do. I hope the Bill is refined to use strong language and have some releases to these victims. |`|53b4ab02a140c57fc81fc2889d6855bdaa	Sometimes common sense has to kick in and people need to realize they can't pay for a $450,000 house with a $30,000 a year income.    Why should I help pay for their mistake? I didn't make that mistake and never will.|`|jWTZfP4naa	why not keep the money and let all the evicted people move into the abandoned financial district offices?|`|0eR7sZNlaa	Smoove B is absolutely right - hit the nail on the head.  The victims in this mess are responsible taxpayers that hold mortgages and timely pay them.|`|kpa1jMG5aa	Yeah, it will work out just fine, allow them to pay off their mortgage, the companies will get their money...      The problem is that they (companies) will not make all this money from 30 years of payments! |`|6Rkk2biJaa	Not for nothing but those who got those loans knew there was absolutely no way they could make the payments to keep them , and always knew they could walk a way from the mortgage.|`|7HGlf3tzaa	They're, by and large, poor/lower income. Poor/lower income don't make the kind of awesome campaign contributions that the rich/upper income do. They also would just waste the $700 billion on frivolous stuff like food and clothes instead of doing something smart like taking the $700 billion in exchange for stock, then buying back the stock at a lower price with the taxpayer money you got, and in the process re-inflating the stock value to artificial highs again, which is more socially responsible.|`|awuGFzOPaa	Because they are no more a victim than the banks are. Congress forced the banks to make those loans under the Community Reinvestment Act passed under Carter. Then under Clinton they were forced to increase their risky loans when Congress pushed up the percentage of risky loans banks had to make in 1992. Bush tried to lower the number of loans and Congress did not go along. They were busy promising their constituents "affordable housing".      Where is the personal responsibility when it comes to knowing if you are buying more than you can afford? Do we now need the government to run peoples personal budgets? Do not buy a house if you are in debt, have no down payment, do not have an emergency fund and the payments are more than 1/4 of your monthly income.     These lenders did not go out to these peoples homes and force them to sign something they didn't understand or could not afford. They did it all by themselves.    It is called a life lesson when you lose a home or anything else you can't afford. I lost a home back in 1998 because we did everything wrong and bought a home we couldn't afford. We learned from that and never repeated the same mistake again.
9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	the aim of the government of any country is to safe guard the interests of the big business houses because the political leaders' existence depend on the contributions, received from corporate houses.|`|xQgciq09aa	I think all the evidence shows that most Republicans want nothing of the sort.    Most of the Republican representatives voted against the bill to bailout the lenders, because most of their Republican constituents, told them they did not want the lenders to get a bailout.    What evidence do you have that their opinion is actually in the minority for Republicans?    There is much more evidence that most Democrats want to bailout the lenders, since the majority of their representatives voted for it, just yesterday!|`|Souvww0maa	The problem that we are faced with isn't as simple as you make it out to be.  It isn't a question of bailing out lenders so much as it is a question of the liquidity of the capital markets.  If the money supply dries up, the economy dries up with it.|`|pOJ8G7Sgaa	So dumb banks can still lend money to dumber borrowers.|`|AA10079277	Huh?  Did you miss the vote yesterday?

(United Press International, 7/28/05)|`|8qkJIun5aa	YOU MEAN DEMOCRATS RIGHT?|`|O7EFbgqYaa	I am a Republican and I most certainly do not want to bail these companies out.

You lost all credibility when you inserted "Republicans" into that sentence. Your Democrats want it just as bad.    In 2005, John McCain and the "Republicans" introduced a bill warning of Freddie and Fannie that was stopped by the "Democrats". Obama and Dodd have received over $250,000 from them. These 2 entities (Fannie & Freddie) have been in the Democrats pockets for decades.|`|AA10768445	Because they all think that someday, they're going to be leaders.

So who is it that want dumb lenders bailed out?|`|GxfyHfAbaa	I think you are a little confused. Republicans are the ones who opposed the bail out yesterday. Democrats are the ones who refused to change the law when McCain told the congress this mess was going to happen.

And the path of least resistance is always downhill.   But America's way is the rising road.   This nation is daring and decent and ready for change. " Sure fixed that prosperity thing good, hasn't he?  Later he assured Americans "I don't have enemies to fight. And I have no stake in the bitter arguments of the last few years. I want to change the tone of Washington to one of civility and respect"  And the highlight of the evening when the young and ambitious governor proclaimed "A generation shaped by Vietnam must remember the lessons of Vietnam.

wsTK80H6aa	No, because they aren't tied to lobbyists and special interest groups like the major parties. No one is above corruption. As Lord Acton said, "Power tends to corrupt and absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely." Ron Paul wasn't a 3rd party candidate technically because he was running as a Republican, but ideologically he was more like a 3rd party candidate. There may have never been as honest of a candidate as Ron Paul. He told us the bad news and a candidate never does that. He said we were headed toward a worldwide economic collapse, but people chose not to listen because the establishment candidates were saying there's no way that America ( the greatest civilization in the history of the world) could possibly be hit by an economic collapse. Well Dr. Paul was right and here we are. Time to start listening to people like Ron Paul and his Campaign for Liberty!

As a matter of fact our candidate for president this year, Bob Barr, is in my opinion nothing but an opportunist looking to get in the spotlight.  Any spotlight.  But the truth is that in order to be corrupt you need both motive and opportunity.  Money is the most common motive, but opportunity requires you to actually win the election and be in a position of power.  And third parties are, almost by definition, underdogs in any election.  Hence corruption is most likely not a primary factor in their decision to run.  If they were looking to pad their pockets or abuse their power they'd be running as a democrat or republican, which has an increased chance of winning.  A third party candidate is almost guaranteed to lose.  Not always, but usually.  So if they're running as a third party it tells you that they're more ideologically driven then most.  And thus are less likely to be corrupted.  Not beyond corruption, but less likely to engage in it.|`|yUukaisCaa	They aren't ,but the Corporations won't waste their money on some party that won't have the power .

If you Obama supporters out there would bother to actually examine the proposals that he makes you would run as fast as you could to vote for McCain. Obama is a fantastic speaker and can talk circles around just about anyone else...but his policies are bad for America.     One of Obama's spokespersons this morning stated that the tax increase on those he calls rich would be on the GROSS sales, not on the profits or individual salary of the owner. Earlier today, I talked to a couple of so called "small businesses" in my community of less than 6,000 people. One was a grocery store, the other a hardware store. Obama's taxing the rich policy would add three percent tax to their books because they GROSS more than $250,000 per year. Also, many of my farming neighbors out here also GROSS more than $250,000 per year but after all the expenses of farm land taxes, putting in the crop, the cost of equipment, fuel, seed, fertilizer, weed killer and insecticides needed to make sure the crop actually grew to maturity, they will get less than minimum wage for all their hours. Are you willing to work for that? That means that nearly EVERY grocery and hardware store in the country would be affected by the increase and then passing that extra 3% tax on to you in the form of higher prices. All businesses that it effects will do that and who pays for it? Us. It is either that or laying off an employee to maintain their normal profit margin (which is not all that high to start with). Are you willing to pay extra for everything you buy just so a bunch of people Obama considers poor can get this so called "tax credit"? Well I'm not. I have had to work for everything I have and so have my neighbors. I do not make anywhere near $250,000 a year so I would receive that "tax break" Obama talks about, but my added costs would outweigh anything I would gain. And for that matter, every TAX PAYER in the country will essentially be paying himself that tax credit because the government itself does not have money of their own. They have only what comes from us in the form of taxes. So in otherwords, I give Obama the money and he sends a portion of it back to me, and then takes that same amount and sends it to someone who does not pay taxes....because they need it. His spreading the wealth is just another name for another handout to those who already rely on the government for just about everything.|`|AA11431433	I doubt it.      There has to be something to explode...|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	Better yet, challenge him to make a speech that doesn't include the acronym "POW."|`|gSdeVUOTaa	You bethcha. Along with if he was forced to defend his associations and acquaintances.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	Lol I think so yes. Thankfully for his health he doesn't have a plan.|`|c3vPZfghaa	I don't think he would be able to talk about it, because I doubt he has any plans outside the typical GOP talking points.|`|2BdxLgO4aa	LMAO. Yes it would.|`|51xtLyFBaa	He would have to remain silent because he flip flops so much he doesn't know what his plan is.|`|IsrmpNNBaa	lmao, or heart attack, god forbid|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	He does, but your limited attention span has kept you from either hearing or comprehending his  agenda.|`|tU912Cawaa	YES -BUT McSame will choose to distract voters with fringe issues. LIKE his campaign said, if we talk about the economy we going to lose. What i don't understand is bush is at 25% approval rating. McSAME VOTED WITH HIM 90% of the time, trash the economy, war, attorney general firings, etc......WHY DO HE THINK HE HAS  A CHANCE OF WINNING?
zrthZOCdaa	first Obama voted to increase taxes on people making $42,000 a year, then he changed his mind for political reasons and it is now $250,000, dont you believe him, first thing a Democrats does ALWAYS AND I MEAN ALWAYS IS TO RAISE TAXES, AND THE MIDDLE ALWAYS CATCHES IT, OBAMA HAS HIS LOOPHOLES, THE POOR PAY NOTHING, SO GUESS WHAT?|`|AA11696297	first off ike, you're wrong.  according to his taxes he made $40k last year.  anyway, "Joe" is a McCain shill; he's a fake.|`|49491d4026350f4de724cb49c3744085aa	he never said he made that much.  and he said he hopes to buy the business someday.  his concern was that if he bought the business and it made over $250,000, then his taxes would go up under obama's plan.  |`|C4EGYiazaa	What?  He already started a business.  He was referring to Obama raising his taxes if he were President, according to his "plans."|`|WL3KcegWaa	When did he say that he can't afford to start a business.    His concern was about taxes.  not the affordability of the business.    Wy do liberals insist on stretching the truth to fit their reality?|`|hMLmrPbgaa	According to the news reports, he made $40K last year and couldn't even afford to pay his taxes.|`|56c4b61aa3e2695f58adae3f19e00bbdaa	The man makes FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR.  And owes taxes.  He just has big dreams and perhaps now that he is either on or has a possibility of being on the republiCON payroll, he may be able to buy that business that has been long out of his reach.    He doesn't even have a plumbers license|`|xG2wR4xlaa	Joe is not a McCain shill. He's not a fake he is a real plumber whom Obama made the choice to walk through Joe's neighborhood. Joe didn't go looking for Obama at a rally, or an event. Obama came to him.     This is the reason Obama has steered cleared of any town hall meetings type events where he can't control the questions.    Because the switch is that Obama answered the question and everybody saw what he was really about. Spreading the wealth around.

In actuality I would put my fist up into the air for assistance from my fellow lifeguards or just save both, I'm a decent swimmer.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Obama, because McCain is on his last feet, and if he survived and became President he could do lots of damage to this country.

I guess I'd be stuck trying to save the old decrepit warmonger.|`|omHCxaVJaa	I would grab them both in each arm and try to help them.

After I saved Obama , I'd probably be pretty tired.
vY9XGOUNaa	I would say no, purelly beacause only the colour of their skin would change, their upbringin wouldnt and neither would their policies, Obama would still be the honest candidate looking out for the lower class and McCain would still be a underhanded coward who will play many dirt games to make Obama look bad.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	At this point I don't thinks so. Blacks never supported Clarence Thomas because they knew he was a traitor and an oppressor. Right wingers have and will support Blacks like Thomas, Rice , So well and others, just because of political agreement. Similarly Alberto Gonzalez, alias GONZO, was repudiated by Hispanics ad other decent Americans.For the same reasons the cons would support a Black McCain over a White Obama|`|c767faeb6ae25829f84d589c038c29b0aa	Probably both McCain & Obama would have lost in the primary. Huckabee would have beaten McCain if he were black. McCain is not conservative enough for many Republicans as it is. And him being black wouldn't help among the ones who see race as a factor. For the Dems, Obama gained a lot of ground because he was black, really half white & half black, but nobody in the Democratic Party is going to mention his white side ;). If he were white he would of lost to Hillary because she's a woman. The Dems are so concerned about minorities that they'll push any candidate that's a minority because it looks like progress. These are the same people that would hire a black person or a female just because they're black or female & not because they're the best person for the job. If a minority candidate gets elected as a Republican he or she has usually earned it because they have to work twice as hard. If a minority candidate gets elected as a Democrat it's a much easier road for them. With Sarah Palin that doesn't apply though because she's an attractive female. Attractive females don't have it as bad. Especially if they suck a few d**** along the way. Of course i don't know why women are considered minorities when there are more women than men. Especially when it comes to those who are eligable to vote or are of age to do so.|`|AA10719402	McCain wouldn't have a chance.|`|cpLoD9NJaa	Well the first thing the liberals would say is that the "black Republican"  isn't black enough, or isn't really black or something to that effect.  |`|df7d9c71d0e64ebc9642d34cd776c726aa	Obama uses Utopian philosophy to get people interested, then he soft links it with his policy and asks people to trust him to pull it off.  Typically Utopian promises result in very long bread lines, but can get a lot of support.  People like Hitler, Marx, Stalin, and Mao are the most infamous people to use this philosophy, but it is also popular among televangelists.|`|B309jFKeaa	Yes, it would change a lot of things.  Obama would definitely win in this scenario.  |`|guHJypD7aa	a black republican? lol|`|Jwd5uIVwaa	Nope. It would change the way some people voted, but not the majority.|`|2vtP7WS7aa	Mccain probably would have never made it to the Senate with Obama's associations with corruption much less the Presidency.|`|gKW1ufGbaa	Yes, it would. I think that if McCain were black he would win hands down.  A small amount of blacks would vote for him just because he was black and that would be enough to win in such a close election. |`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	It is hard to say because so much would be different.    McCain wouldn't be the son and grandson of an Admiral.    Obama may have joined the Senate when he was 30, like Joe Biden did.|`|sGiPNrVXaa	It may, if people are foolish and don't care about the issues. Palin talking about 'six pack' certainly seems to make people think she cares about the average person. So to answer your question, sure race could fool some people. |`|P21H7Yb8aa	It would change. Totally. Most Black people are voting for Obama because they THINK he's black. He not. He's only 6% black. A little bit of white, and the rest is ARAB.|`|KQ1YoXhSaa	wow..that's a good question, but i have to say...i think obama would still be ahead in the polls...i know i'd still vote the same way because when i vote, i look at policies...and base my vote on which candidate i think is best for office no matter what race they are...|`|XNsuLIFFaa	Yes. I think there is still too much racism in America.|`|y9HO1dWsaa	Race has NOTHING to do with the election.          I would still vote for John McCain (Black OR white).|`|zcqvFZF6aa	If that were the case you would never have seen McCain reach the level of Presidential Candidate for the Republican party!|`|cLy7FhiCaa	wow thats almost a cowboy troy kinda question..im backin McCain 100%..o wait my absentee ballot is already filled out and in the mail..McCain 98..hooah|`|Jto0YKmDaa	Yes. Sen. Obama would have been running with double digit gains.|`|xM9GXUhUaa	yes and know there is a lot of people in  america that are raceist so yes.....but no because there is people that don't like Obama because of who he is so it is a dermination of how you see things and ur personal opinion.! |`|9lH1Y3Nzaa	Blacks would be voting Republican in the millions.|`|bc2136cb56252a3ef52deba77b714dd5aa	Based on what is known of black people and the way they generally think, although, happily there are a good many exceptions, I do not believe that there would be any chance of McCain, as a black person, putting forward what McCain is putting forward now.   Obama as a white person would never have gotten the backing that he now has from the people who back him. True this is a point of debate that could rage on for years to come, but it is all speculative, and not very realistic. The races, and their core values and beliefs have to be understood. |`|bvWgHr5Qaa	yeah I bet the black vote would go to mccain, since they only vote for obama cuz he's black.  other than that I bet it would be about the same.  there are good ole boys that are both dem. and rep. and they wouldn't vote for a black dude regardless.  it's ignorant but it's a fact.  all these voters who registered for the first time this year are not just blacks hoping for the first black president.  they are all the people who DONT want a black president too.      I'd vote for McCain if he was purple.  Obama couldn't be a color I like enough to get my vote.|`|zlxKpyroaa	It wouldn't be possible - rebullycans would NEVER allow a candidate who is not a white, non-Orthodox Christian bible-thumping male.
iVv6bFW2aa	MCCAIN"s because they are backward and see any public health measure as a threat. Some of them are paranoid about fluoridation. It's been effective in preventing cavities and in the small amounts in the water supply it's been deemed safe.Right wingers have been notorious in leading ant flouridation campaigns|`|6JQUIZFTaa	McCain.  Obama's are all on his special mix of koolaide.|`|JJ92thVeaa	/ That would be the McCain people.      McCain/Palin   2008    |`|Feq6xkbYaa	Great name dumdum!|`|VbfhlTN9aa	I'm sure it's just more then fluoridate in the water they are drinking. But I would say both. Most voters are going to vote on party line not issues. Some people say they are undecided, but they know who they are going to vote for, they are not telling or want to be neutral.     Drinking the Kool-Aid"    The earliest known use of the term in its figurative, non-literal context (that is, outside descriptions of people actually drinking real Kool-Aid), is from a 1987 quote about former Washington, D.C., mayor Marion Barry in the Washington Post.[3][4]  The term is derived from the 1978 cult suicide in Jonestown, Guyana. Jim Jones, the leader of the Peoples Temple, persuaded his followers to move to Jonestown. Late in the year he ordered his followers to commit suicide by drinking grape-flavored Flavor Aid laced with potassium cyanide. A camera from inside the compound shows a large chest being opened, clearly showing boxes of both Flavor Aid and Kool-Aid.[5] There is also testimony from criminal investigators at the Jonestown inquest stating that there were "cool aid" [sic] packets there.[6] It is unknown whether these are a reference to the Kool-aid brand packets from the trunk, or simply a generic use of the more popular brand for the product. In what is now commonly called the "Jonestown Massacre", a large majority of the 913 people later found dead drank the brew. (The discrepancy between the idiom and the actual occurrence is likely due to Flavor Aid's relative obscurity,compared to the easily recognizable Kool-Aid.) An earlier usage than 1987 can be attested at least as early as 1982 in the film "The Slumber Party Massacre" by Amy Holden Jones. In the scene where Valerie 'Val' Bates prepares Kool-Aid, she offers a glass to her sister and says "As the famous Jim Jones once said: 'should have been drinking Kool-Aid'".  The saying "Do not drink the Kool-Aid" now commonly refers to the Jonestown tragedy, meaning "Do not trust any group you find to be a little on the kooky side," or "Whatever they tell you, do not believe it too strongly."[7] Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly is famous for using the term in this manner.[8]  Having "drunk the Kool-Aid" also refers to being a strong or fervent believer in a particular philosophy or mission  wholeheartedly or blindly believing in its virtues.[9][10]  This expression can also be used to refer to the activities of the Merry Pranksters, a group of people associated with novelist Ken Kesey[citation needed] who, in the early 1960s, traveled around the United States and held events called "Acid Tests", where LSD-laced Kool-Aid was passed out to the public (LSD was legal in the U.S. until 1966). Those who drank the "Kool-Aid" passed the "Acid Test". "Drinking the Kool-Aid" in that context meant accepting the LSD drug culture, and the Pranksters' "turned on" point of view. These events were described in Tom Wolfe's 1968 classic "The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test". However the expression is never used figuratively in the book, but only literally; therefore, the book is not the origin of the term. |`|nYDElY0Eaa	I never drink fluoridated water because I have a well.

4vhbUefNaa	Obama performed alot better then McCain. Obama was more detailed and firm on where he stands. McCain was ambiguous and repeating talking points. McCain was very disrespectful and condescending.|`|QY4Hy00qaa	Well I think they did but quite honestly it didn't make me want to change my vote. It was kinda of boring I thought that if McCain is the man with experience why did he not put Obama away,he should have knocked Obama out one, two, three. |`|v7znwcqLaa	 No, we lose no matter whose elected president. What did either say about crime or illegal aliens in the US,    Over 100,000 murders in America from 2002 through 2006. In America, the crime clock continues to click: one murder every 22 minutes, one rape every 5 minutes, one robbery every 49 seconds, and one burglary every 10 seconds. During the year of 2005 there were 4 to 10 MILLION illegal aliens that crossed our Southern Border also, as many as 19,500 illegal aliens from Terrorist Countries. Millions of pounds of drugs, cocaine, meth, heroine and marijuana, crossed into the U. S from the Southern border. The illegal aliens in the United States have a crime rate that's two and a half times that of white non-illegal aliens. In particular, their children, are going to make a huge additional crime problem in the US.      Has Obama or McCain addressed any of these problems that we are having in all of our major Cities? How about crime, hoodlum gangs, drugs, early release of felons, murders, and child molesters. These people are released by the thousands every day back into our lower middle class and hard working poor neighborhoods.   The cost of crime continues to mount: $78 billion for the criminal justice system, $202 billion in loss of life and work, $120 billion in crimes against business, $60 billion in stolen goods and fraud, $40 billion from drug abuse, and $110 billion from drunk driving. When you add up all the costs, crime costs Americans a stunning $675 billion each year.  |`|fHJD2MEnaa	OBAMA ANSWERS WAS FULL SUBSTANCE ON THE ISSUES.

I do!!!|`|LMQQGvKgaa	Hey. I watched a bit of the debate during my break at work. McCain said "my friends" fairly often!! It was quite cringe-worthy to be honest. They talked about the issues. Unsuprisingly the economy played a huge part (at least it did in the bit I saw).  As with all debates it was nothing but a glorified slanging match really. My preference lies with Obama but when the question 'what would your priorities be if you got into office' he said that his first priority would be energy and spending $15bn a year for 10 years to make the USA self-sufficient. That is all well and good but people would rather have their lives sorted out before energy sources...it's just human nature!  You can probably find a site on the internet to watch the debate or at least the highlights!!
AA10254410	Clinton left Bush a surplus, Bush squandered it all and more on his Iraq War To Nowhere.  Typical military, typical republican.    Obama/Biden 08!..|`|6qyrhgjwaa	That is a very dum dum question.  But thanks for asking.|`|96zZlJVYaa	Bush is trying help McCain to win the white house by using the blame game. this way if congress later file charges against those who sit back and allow this to happen, he would give them full pardon.     the banks presidents are the ones who is really the blame for the housing market and along with the Fed Reserve board for not rise the interest rate.  take a minute and think about this, when you apply for a mortgage loan for  $345,965.00 and your income is $55,000.00. since the interest rate is low and they have create a new loan system (sub prime) so you can lived the american dream of owing your home.  its no way that the loan officer should have approve you a loan of this size. You start out paying $890.00 for the first 3yrs of the loan and it would start to rise here after. The next six month your payment would be $1,246.00 and the follow six month it would climb to $1,658.00 and it will peak at $3,157.00 the stock market will also influence your mortgage payment, when it goes up or down so does your payment.     this is part of the problem the other part due to the cost of the war in Iraqi. which cost 10 billion each month to keep our troops over there to fight.  since they didn't find any WMD why didn't the president bring them back home? the claim that the money from the Iraqi oil will pay for the war and not the tax payer. guess what, the profit from the oil is 98 billion and none of it going toward the war cost. I was told today that the Iraqis going to built the largest ferris wheel with air condintion with that money. hello!!  |`|q0LMxKcjaa	because in 2004, the Republicans tried to warn the Democrats that this was coming and they said, "It ain't broke....don't fix it!"

The reason the cash flow and collateral coverage appeared to work, though, is that the Fed brought the overnight rate to 1% after 9/11.    Greenspan blames the global savings glut, which pushed long yields down.       But the problem, especially in the markets that were hardest-hit, was mainly with ARMs.   ARMs are priced off the federal funds rate, which Greenspan controlled the whole time.

This is still a bail-out.  It's paying Wall Street for the full value of a bad loan so you can subsidize the homeowner.

"John McCain would pay for his health plan with major reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, a top aide said, in a move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts of $1.3 trillion over 10 years to the government programs."    He didn't go into a whole lot of detail about how he plans to reduce those programs, though. They only mentioned eliminating fraud and reforming payment policies.

This is McCain's big Health care solution.  To take people off of Medicare and medicaid who need it but can not afford it .  This is genocide in my opinion.|`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	He doesn't want to do that.

He don't have to worry about a thing since he has both Senate and VA insurance, thus not needing Medicare. An evil old man|`|ekABeHl6aa	I do not believe that he does.

And I would think they would be ranting if he threatened this.|`|TifUsG4Maa	Because he really doesn,t care about them or our kids.....Why should he care,he,s worth millions thanks to his wife.|`|R8GQZCInaa	because he is already one foot in the grave and doesn't care about anyone else but himself. he has his own personal medicare called a millionaire trophy wife who wipes his butt for him. the news is covering it and the elderly in florida are listening too.|`|9PD8lizyaa	this is not true.
iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, it would be very effective. McSAME has already lost votes among the elderly, OBAMA 2008, is now ahead in Florida, which is very unexpected.|`|TxC6Fry0aa	He needs to!!!

252488faa61d45ab5dd0a3a3b86bd138aa	I hadn't heard this one, but it isn't surprising. McCain had to have Joe Lieberman correct him on Shia vs. Sunni.

I am quite certain that Ms. Palin knows the difference between the two, and unlike many Americans, she could probably even point them out on a map.  Can you?  |`|3oHiiVAlaa	because she is a moron, she is no more qualified to be VP than my pomeranian is qualified to perform open heart surgery. It seems stupid people think she is great because she make them look smart.    "2+2 UUHH  UUMMM IS CHICKEN"|`|Pv9ALQfpaa	Maybe because the US government through the soldiers are trying to build schools in Afghanistan... :/     http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/12/...    or at least they were 4 years ago...     and from 2 years ago:  http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarti...|`|eB8bDbSuaa	She's a retard who has no business being a governor, let alone a VP.

So why do we have bases there?|`|TCVgnZhoaa	Because Palin just doesn't really care much for foreign affairs nor geography.     If she cared about foreign affairs she never would have accepted the VP nomination that's for sure.|`|OrkAQPfoaa	this is to the first person, Those things said by Biden and Clinton were in the heat of the battle. they were doing the same thing Mccain is doing now trying to win the nomination.So you have to throw those out. But if you want to take those clips what about the thing the Republicans said about McCain .|`|GeQ5XEKJaa	Because to me any place where ragheads live would look the same.|`|GrLIOUDgaa	ha ha, well she certainly isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer.|`|yHwUbD6Saa	No. It's one of those moment's like:    "There are 57 states" - Obama  "Obama is not fit to lead the country" - Biden  "I'd gladly be McCain's running mate" - Biden  "I'm not the guy [Obama's VP pick]" - Biden  "Hillary was a better VP choice than me" - Biden  "I'm in Kansas City" - Obama (from St. Louis)  "Arab translators are being sent to Afghanistan" - Obama (they don't speak Arabic, they speak multiple other languages, including Farsi)  "Tom" - Obama (referring to McCain in the debate)  "Tim" - Obama (referring to Matt Lauer)  "My Muslim faith" - Obama  "I think I have a much higher IQ than you" - Biden  "You can't go into a convenience store without an Indian accent. Seriously. I'm serious."  - Biden  "There will be NO coal plants in the U.S." - Biden (not realizing Obama promises clean coal plants)  "France helped us rid Lebanon of Hezbollah" - Biden (clearly has no idea WTF he's talking about)  "The Senate banking committee is MY committee" - Obama (he's not on it)    "I support the 2nd Amendment" - Obama (after voting to ban all semi-automatic firearms, supporting D.C.'s handgun ban, opposing the individual rights amicus brief in the Heller vs. U.S. case, voting to criminalize armed self defense in one's own home against violent attack, voting to ban most hunting ammunition [e.g. .308], voting to ban concealed pistol licenses, and stating there's no evidence to support opposing gun control [his own Harvard Journal in 2007: http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs...  ])    Also, if you read the full response (un-edited) to the question, not just the infamous "I can see Russia" comment, in the Gibson interview, you'd see she gave a better and more detailed answer than that. ( http://www.newsbusters.org/blogs/p-j-gla... ).|`|5c70e4a7234f0be8642df55ef4a96e46aa	Americans and Palin don't know geography.  It's true. Go out to Manhattan and ask some american dude "where is spain" he will asnwer it's an island in the carribean. Or better yet, ask him what is capital of Europe. He will say it is either London or Paris.    Check out this video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJuNgBklo...|`|4f8b7b9da7d71bc28c2059ffe4f0bb7eaa	What about Biden's gaffes?

Here are some:  http://www.gop.com/BarackGaffes/    Enjoy!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	First of all because she's an idiot, uninterested in other countries, except now she can't handle it, nor can McSAME. Also she probably flunked geography in High School. She see further than her belly button.

Do you even have a clue how the stock market works?|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, but stupid Mc SAME can't see  it when he says that the economy is in good shape. I dread to hear what it would mean if he found the economy in bad shape. He'll drive it there, straight to hell. OBAMA 2008|`|8yE2sYGeaa	It is ALWAYS the economy, stupid.

mCQRl6cnaa	Powell's endorsement will asure many people who were thinking about voting him but were hesitant because of right wing propaganda. Powell is soldier like McCain and has big standing between Republicans, Many would vote for Obama.|`|AA11369432	I think it will go a long ways....He is a wise man.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	Powell's endorsement means nothing to me as a voter.  His career was destroyed when he encouraged the congress to vote for using force in Iraq.  My guess is this is an attempt to exonerate himself.  As far as I know Obama and Powell don't even know each other personally so of what value is his endorsement?|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Obama will sweep this election, big time.  |`|giwL7Iozaa	I thought you said "How will it affect the trolls!"|`|0uhsH7obaa	Wrong! McCain has 4 former secretary of states endorsing him. In addition to that your educated public will ask why? Powell was all for the war and Obama voted against it, Powell does not agree with the tax increase, so why exactly is he doing that! They disagree on MAJOR topics! I guess anyone with common sense will see through this!|`|CYXQ4uwvaa	I think the effect on the polls will be minimal. The conservative view on Colin Powell will be very unfavorable. He was treated unfairly by Bush`s administration, so I could see where he owes them nothing.  Any backing by conservatives for his future political ambitions will now be non existent due to being viewed as a traitor.    Personally I applaud Colin for going against Bush`s personal request that he not endorse Obama, because it would embarrass the GOP.|`|i2vISNWDaa	it might, but you have to wait to find out|`|711R4J6saa	Since Powell's endorsement is no great big surprise it probably won't have any effect.|`|gdRRlg6yaa	It won't.    I am a Patriotic American aka Republican.    My first impression of Colin Powell was correct.    I never did trust Colin Powell, but gave him the benefit of the doubt.    Colin Powell is a true politician I am not surprised that he is positioning himself behind who he thinks may win.    I am not surprised that he is voting along racist lines to protect the black vote for him self in the event he chooses to run for office in the future.    Colin Powell is a traitor to America.  |`|UsXBMyagaa	umm none...it just effects him.|`|5b84350c247202a0fd3e66f2f0e4a355aa	Colin Powell is all washed up. No one cares what he thinks now.|`|hy45DHxgaa	General Powell's endorsement probably  will NOT effect the voting too much!  (Polls are Fleeting!)    I'm GLAD he stepped up~  & showed his Intelligence, though!    But Repugnants will continue to vote  their Ticket of Juan McCane & the Pail-In!    Looks like another Close Gen. Election!    NO Drama~  Vote Obama!  2008-2017|`|c2fa128b8a6450f85a0dc36451a9a17daa	I think this might make a lot of people get to the polls for McCain that had given up hope. This is the kind of thing that could back-fire. People may start looking at this as blacks piling on. A lot of whites came out to vote hillary in the last of the primaries just to push back at the blacks who were blindly voting for Obama.

Are they too "maverick" for education?    I don't think Bush is stupid; I think he's a poor communicator with a dangerous attitude who has benefitted greatly from nepotism.|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	One would have to run, wouldn't one?|`|rttm1SLaaa	Education is important, does that mean it's necessary to have the best possible education to be president or VP?  No.  But there's a bottom line.  Palin went to 5 colleges in 6 years in order to graduate.  McCain and Bush both graduated towards the bottom of their respective classes.  While these may not be deal breakers, it certainly begs questions about both of their qualifications as leaders.|`|4csESdkoaa	phd is not necessary.  knowing the name of the commanding general in afghanistan is necessary.|`|e825be3688c359c1a72e2a5ca484b0b0aa	what are you saying education is not important? maybe for "Joe-six-pack" the drunken hobo. but for us civilized people, education is very important. |`|WmgqUYnjaa	I think you know that answer to this one!    Chris I|`|qhdhva5Daa	Both Biden and Obama have doctorates.  They are both doctors of Law.  So you see, the Democrats DO have PHDs running.  John McCain graduated 5th from the bottom of his class while Palin has a 4 year degree after attending 5 different colleges to get it.  The PROOF therefore is that Democrats are educated, and republicans are not.  And it shows Big Time.    How's that foot taste?|`|deJ9df1iaa	I think that would be great...    We really don't want "Joe Six-pack" running the country.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	It will become even worse, the gargantuan deficit of USA will destroy public education.Anyway, as unemployment is the future of US youth, many will leave their studies.|`|SlWjhHJnaa	It only matters in certain elections.  during the Bush/Kerry election people were saying that it was important for a president to have served his country. the   Dems are not even bringing that up this time.  The rules change to suit the left.|`|zrHLiU0Faa	Yeah, lets stop making doctors have degrees too! And pilots! who needs em - can't we all just admit we are joe sixpackers and let anyone do anything? |`|mkCjcG5oaa	Juris Doctorate is still a doctorate.  |`|Z7mhIuEEaa	Education is important, but it must be combined with many other qualities.|`|GHfaIQn3aa	Law degrees and Master's degrees are the education you get if you are going to be a professional.    Ph.Ds are primarily for research, teaching, and think tanking. They have highly specialized but narrow fields of study.    Thus, Law and Master's degrees are good for politicians and leaders to acquire, but a Ph.D might not be.    edit: J.D. = Bachelor's in law   LL.M= Master's in law  SJD= Ph.D in law    It's weird because you need a Bachelor's to get a Bachelor's in law.

"(AP) Republican John McCain's campaign says Sarah and Todd Palin had a gross income of nearly $170,000 last year and paid nearly $25,000 in taxes.     The campaign also says the couple made nearly $130,000 and paid about $12,000 in taxes in 2006.     McCain's campaign released the joint income tax return Friday for his vice presidential nominee and her husband.     The couple donated more than $8,000 to charity over two years.     Their income jump from 2006 to 2007 resulted from the salary increase when Sarah Palin became Alaska's governor.     The McCain-Palin campaign had said the tax returns would be released Monday, but it suddenly put them out Friday afternoon - a time long used by government to reveal embarrassing news because few people watch TV or read newspapers Friday evening and Saturday."    And this was from a Democratic supporting news station......

bFLP6COgaa	Remember that when you vote in November, you are actually voting for electors who will choose the President when the electoral college convenes in December. Under federal law, electors are not bound to vote for anyone in particular, though several states to have laws requiring electors to vote as per that state's election results.    If McCain were to be elected by the electoral college and were to die after that and before being sworn into office, the scenario is simple. The Vice President Elect (Sarah Palin) would be sworn in as President on January 20th. The office of Vice President would be vacant and President Palin would have to appoint someone to the position.    If, however, McCain were to die before the electoral college convened, the situation is much more complicated, and Obama-Palin (no, that's not a typo) would be a very likely scenario in this case.    If McCain died before the electoral college convened, the electors could conceivably still vote for McCain. When the votes are counted by a joint session of Congress on 6 January, the Congress would have to decide whether the votes for the late McCain are valid. There is precedent for this; in 1872, candidate Horace Greeley died on 29 November, after the general election but before the electoral college met. Three electors nonetheless voted for Greeley, and those votes were disallowed by Congress. It is therefore likely that any votes for McCain would be similarly discounted if he died before the Electoral College met.    It is likely the electors would be be directed to vote a different way by the Republican Party. It is possible, however, that some electors may be prohibited by state law from doing so, and that this would result in a situation where no candidate received 270 electoral votes. If this happened, the 12th Amendment to the Constitution states that a President would be chosen by the newly-elected House of Representatives, with each state delegation getting one vote, from among the three candidates receiving the highest number of electoral votes.. Since the Democrats control a majority of state delegations, it is likely that Obama would be elected President by the House.    In this situation, there would be no need to remove Palin from the ticket, though in most states nothing would stop electors from voting differently. Unless enough electors changed their vote from Palin (either on their own or at the direction of the party) to bring her electoral vote count below 270, Palin would still become Vice President. If no Vice Presidential candidate received 270 electoral votes, the newly-elected Senate would choose a Vice-President from the two candidates who received the most votes. It is likely the Senate would choose Joe Biden. Knowing this likely outcome, the Republican Party would probably stick with Palin.    If a President had not been chosen by Inauguration Day, the Vice President Elect would be sworn in as Vice President and serve as *acting* President until a President could be chosen.|`|AA10114813	No one is ready for a soccer mom president.

A4vc2Dg9aa	All fine and good except for one major problem. The Zionists in Israel, and the Zionists in Nort America and Britain want to bomb Iran. They want this despite any official negotiations that may be going on. They see Iran as a major stumbling block to their ambitions - to establish the state of Greater Israel stretching from the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Only then (they believe) will it be possible to rebuild the mythical Temple of Solomon on Temple Mount in Jerusalem (where the Dome of The Rock mosque now stands). Only then (they believe), will the Jewish messiah come, and then the Rapture can take place.  |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because both countries have more in common in terms of foreign policy and production of heating fuels. The USA has not been particularly friendly to either country so they both are forced to ally with each other. The principle that the enemy of my enemy seems to apply in this instance. Add Venezuela and most of America too. The US is getting what it deserves because of Bush's stupid imperialistic politics.|`|33ppbrMJaa	I am no expert on foreign relations, so I can only give my views. I think Russia has some kind of proprietary feeling about its former provinces and the fact that the U.S. has backed a Democratic government in Georgia hasn't sat too well.  On the other hand, I think the Georgian President was stupid for ordering troops into Ossetia and risking Russian intervention.    There's been a lot of saber rattling and threats, but with the U.S., the threats are empty. We simply don't have the money or troops to take on another war of any kind.  Putin has not struck me as being aggressive to the rest of the world, but his eye is on the former Soviet nations. However, he has shown some respect for NATO members and I don't think he will make any aggressive moves right now.     The biggest concern at the moment is that missile system in Poland, which could lead to problems there.  We have to remember that, even though the missile might protect Israel, it can't be a comfortable situation for Russia, either.    While relations with Iran are important for Russia, so are relations with Europe.  In an article in the NYT, I see that European sympathies are with Iran, and that nation isn't seen as a vital threat to the world, despite its leader's loud mouth.  I think the U.S.A. should have some diplomatic talks with Iran...and Russia...and this situation can be solved.     There is no doubt but that the stubborn, non-Diplomatic, aggressive stance of the Bush Administration has damaged our country, and it is time we reclaimed our place on the world's stage. Using diplomacy and our status with the UN, we could do a lot toward solving problems concerning our own country and other nations, as well! |`|AA11040149	Regardless who is president, as long as AIPAC has the influence it holds today in respect to politics and the politicians an agreement will not occur between U.S and Iran.  In terms of Russia stands by Iran and from what I have seen on the worldwide news and Russian translated tv, Russia supports Iran and to at least, it seems like they would "throw down" for Iran.  Edit; it is nice to get a "real question" once in a while, good question.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	Russia and Iran seem to get along.  More importantly, Iran has vast quantities of untapped natural gas. Russia has the worlds largest natural gas reserves. It has become quite adept at extracting natural gas, and its companies are more than willing to help Iran, and sell it the equipment, to access their resources.    Iran has also agreed to build a gas pipeline to Pakistan.  Both countries signed an agreement on Sept 24th.  http://capital.trendaz.com/index.shtml?s...    Iran wants direct diplomatic recognition from the US.  Something it has not had since the US-backed Shah of Iran ruled the country.    Until they get it, there will be no negotiations. And Russia will continue to benefit from this rift.      |`|412f673354a42041faf908ccbc558571aa	Since the US and Poland have signed an agreement to set up missile bases in Poland,  I think its just a matter of time before Russia sets up missile bases in Iran as well as Venezuela. Its all pretty simple, you set up missile bases in my backyard, I will set mine in yours.

Even a cursory look at Sen. Helms' record on race - how he voted against every civil rights measure during his 29 years in the US Senate, how he stood virtually alone in trying to block the federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. - shows a man not interested in paving a way for integration, but doing all he could to preserve the archaic principles of a segregationist way of life he felt served the South well.

W9ylIGgbaa	Weatherman, known colloquially as the Weathermen and later the Weather Underground Organization, was an American radical left organization founded in 1969 by leaders and members who split from the Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The group organized a riot in Chicago in 1969 and bombed buildings in the 1970s.    They took their name from the lyric "You don't need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows," from the Bob Dylan song Subterranean Homesick Blues. They also used this lyric as the title of a position paper they distributed at an SDS convention in Chicago on June 18, 1969, as part of a special edition of New Left Notes. The Weathermen were initially part of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM) within the SDS, splitting from the RYM's Maoists by claiming there was no time to build a vanguard party and that revolutionary war against the United States government and the capitalist system should begin immediately. Their founding document called for the establishment of a "white fighting force" to be allied with the "Black Liberation Movement" and other "anti-colonial" movements[2] to achieve "the destruction of US imperialism and achieve a classless world: world communism."[3]    The group's first public demonstration was the "Days of Rage," an October 8, 1969 riot in Chicago that was coordinated with the trial of the Chicago Eight. In 1970 the group issued a "Declaration of a State of War" against the United States government, under the name "Weather Underground Organization" (WUO), and members adopted fake identities and pursued covert activities. They carried out a campaign consisting of bombings, jailbreaks, and riots. Their attacks were mostly bombings of government buildings, along with several banks, police department headquarters and precincts, state and federal courthouses, and state prison administrative offices. This led the FBI to describe their organisation as a Domestic Terrorist group. [4][5]        The group emerged from the campus-based opposition to the Vietnam War, as well as the Civil Rights Movements of the late 1960s. During this time, United States military action in Southeast Asia, especially in Vietnam, escalated. In the U.S., the anti-war sentiment was particularly pronounced during the 1968 U.S. presidential election.    The origins of the Weathermen can be traced to the collapse and fragmentation of the Students for a Democratic Society. The split between the mainstream leadership of SDS, or "National Office," and the Progressive Labor Party pushed SDS as a whole further to the left. National Office leaders such as Bernardine Dohrn and Mike Klonsky began announcing their emerging perspectives, and Klonksy published a document entitled "Toward a Revolutionary Youth Movement" (RYM). RYM promoted the philosophy that young workers possessed the potential to be a revolutionary force to overthrow capitalism, if not by themselves then by transmitting radical ideas to the working class. Klonsky's document reflected the growing leftist philosophy of the National Office and was eventually adopted as official SDS doctrine. During the Summer of 1969, the National Office began to split. A group led by Klonsky became known as RYM II, and the other side, RYM I, was led by Dohrn and endorsed more aggressive tactics, as some members felt that years of non-violent resistance had done little or nothing to stop the Vietnam War.[6] It was also during this time period that the Weathermen sympathized with the radical group Black Panthers. The death of Panther Fred Hampton prompted the Weatherman to issue a declaration of war upon the United States government.    |`|vHxauOyeaa	They wanted communism, their doctrine is quoted saying that they were for the destruction of US imperialism to achieve a classless system for the entire world... A relatively true communism.     As I have always said, communism looks like it would work on paper    But it would grow old quickly when one guy hauling bricks is making the same as the guy who isn't working so hard...

BhrFkPQcaa	He didn't miss it. He was part of the problem, just like Barney Frank|`|Svanlzg7aa	and just how would he be able to force an administration to do what HE wants?|`|PZj93USNaa	Yes, if he would have voted it down the first time around he could have leveraged a bribe on the second vote for a simple yes vote. He probably could have gotten a couple hundred million for Africa or some other pork of his choice.    He's all about change but never attempted to change Bush's bail out plan! LMAO! Could he be more of the same?
0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	It will contribute to it, but don't be fooled.  McCain is torpedoing himself.  He is not the same man he was in 2000 and his choice of Palin was the straw that broke the camels back. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Definitely, unless the people are really ignorany or the GOP steals the election once more.|`|k6hicodfaa	It looks like it.|`|xIowgWL7aa	It has already and it seems that despite the bailout, it's not getting any better, his campaign is sinking lower and lower.

Who can foresee the future?  If anyone can, let me know, I have some stock I would like to sell...|`|siwxWxa0aa	First let me say I am voting for Obama.     That being said, I am not a party voter. I vote on issues. I think McCain would have stood a better chance of gaining my vote were he able to stop being so vague. If he was able to clarify what he considers to be "pork". Not knowing what he thinks is pork I have no clue what he plans to cut. I do know he doesn't support heating assistance for the poor     If he wouldnt have tossed around "maverick" so much, the reason that matters to me is because it made me ask questions like how is he a maverick? What action/votes has made him some sort of rebel? In finding that he has voted the Bush agenda 90% of the time, I can't think of him as a maverick. This tells me he is trying to lie to us hiding behind catch words.     When asked about the fact that he has voted 90% of the time with the Bush agenda, he doesn't answer why he has done so, instead he points fingers at the other party. To earn my vote he can not use these tactics.     He has failed to explain how his administration would be different from Bushes.    The fact that he chose Palin as a running mate, in my opinion shows lack of sound judgment aside from him needing a female mouth piece to do his dirty work knowing that her male counter parts have to take a gentler hand with her. Even though we as women scream that we want equality, the truth is we want convenient equality. If Biden or Obama were to light into her on these issues like they would were she a man, we would hit the roof.     Bottom line is a lot of things contributed to him loosing at least my vote, the economic crisis, while it is an issue for the future of our country, and both parties plans for it are also, I don't hold him accountable for getting us here. Neither party is fully responsible for this crisis and both have contributing shares to it.|`|7mTqbBq8aa	Here is a link you should have watched before asking questions.
Ja6RTWzwaa	Obama.      My husband was diagnosed with cancer 3 weeks ago.  We went to the ER because he was in so much pain and could not stand for more that 5 min. at a time and started to walk hunched over. Do to a pre-existing condition, (testicular cancer, 12 yrs. prior) healthcare was not affordable. He was given an X-ray and was told it looked like he had a few slipped discs.  We were sent away with some Vicodine and a Primary Care appointment two days later.      We went to the PC Dr. and she ordered an MRI, immediately admitting my husband into the hospital, Yale, through the ER.  The ER Dr. did not believe my husband was in pain and did not want to give him the MRI.  My husband told him that his thighs and bottom of his feet were numb.  The ER Dr. said, "It doesnt work that way".  Implying he was lying.  My husband is not a complainer so he did not make a fuss.  A few occasional tears ran down his face.  We had been there for 9 hours, still no MRI and no real pain meds.  The PC Dr., we found out later, fought with the ER Dr. for the MRI and pulled rank, so it was finally done.    After waiting 3 more hours a total of 12, my husband was ready to walk out of the ER.  The ER Dr. had gone for the night but the Physician Assistant was still there.  I went to the nurses station, where she was on the phone, and told her that he was going to walk out if she did not come to see him soon.    At that point everything changed.  The new ER Dr. put us in a room, very quickly, as we were in the hall. The PA came in, sat down on the garbage can and said "Most people with back pain scream and yell they are in so much pain, you were not acting like you were in a lot pain"  Then she proceeded to tell us that he had two fractured discs, and 6 masses.  Two masses on his spine, one of which was 10 cm long and wrapped around his spinal cord, thus the numbness. On one kidney, lymph nodes, stomach.  He was immediately admitted to a room.    After the biopsy, 4 agonizing days, we found out it was treatable.  We spent 2 weeks in the hospital (they got me a cot). He has had his first chemo therapy and thankfully they sent us home, with a brace and some pain meds to get him started 7 days.  He is scheduled for the next 3 chemo therapy treatments through Dec 3rd.  We still are not picked up by state or federal insurance and the price of the meds, Morphine, is $150.  He is now 100% disabled and will not see a Social Security or Disability check for at least 3 months.    I also found out later, through a social worker, that the ER Dr. was discussing my husband's psyc profile and the fact that he committed a felony 23 years ago.  Not concerned that he had testicular cancer 12 years ago.    I spoke with my sister, in Spain; she could not believe what we were going through.  In Spain, and most of the world, if a Dr. orders an MRI you get and MRI, no questions asked.    If health care were affordable to everyone and as Obama said Focus on preventative care we would have caught this sooner.    I hope no one has to go through what we are going through.  WE NEED HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE!  |`|aGNjZmyJaa	You know, I was leaning toward's McCain's, but I didn't know it had a "tax increase" element.

It would be impossible to issue each family a 5000 dollar tax credit for them to choose a health care plan and make money in the economy. Obama's makes more sense especially for businesses, that way we won't have any wal-marts who don't pay their employees health insurance.
cTh9EgYeaa	Education has, for a very long time, leaned to the left. Some institutions a lot more than others.    No, Ayers was never jailed for his crimes. Although his interviews from 2001-2004 shows he has no remorse and he states that he wished America did more.    There are actually quite a few very liberal professors, I am talking socialists or more to the left, at some of the top colleges in the U.S. (Harvard, Yale, UC Berkley, UCLA, etc). I will admit most of them are only ideological and don't have the experience Ayers has.    The University of Chicago has a lot of left "wing" professors. Another is Wendy Doniger.     From a Harvard professor----  "One divinity professor at Harvard, a devotee of feminist theological studies, was fond of saying in and out of class that the proper role of men in religion should be to shut up for a milennium, to offset milennia of patriarchal religion."    Nationally 37% of voters say they are Republican and 34% say they are Democrat. Yet only 3% of 151 Ivy League professors said they were Republican. THREE PERCENT.     84% of the Ivy League professors polled said they voted for Gore in 2000 and 70% don't want a national defense (70% of Ameircans DO want one).|`|YKPN1444aa	The biggest crime is paying 30-50 grand a year sending your kids to liberal colleges where idiots like Ayers "teaches".  No wonder kids are screwed up !|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Essentially he was a fighter for a just cause against war and racism. Fortunately we still have a little bit of freedom in the US, so an individual as brilliant as he is would be hired in a tolerant college.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Kind of shocking, isn't it.  But, just as shocking is how Obama has gotten so far with his socialist agenda.|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Because he was never convicted of any crime, and he matured and changed over time. Or don't you believe in people having the ability to change their ways?|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	Some of the evidence against him was illegally obtained and the Feds were forced on a technicality to drop the charges against him.|`|UNF2gmpqaa	It amazes me too. Timothy McVeigh got the death penalty for his doing in the Oklahoma bombing (as well he should have) yet his guy doesn't even serve jail time. I'm now finding out that some evidence against him was illegally obtained making it impossible to be admissible in court. Yet, in his interview with the NY Times in 2001 he isn't remorseful and has said "he wishes he could've done more" and in his book he says the same thing. He participated in three attacks against the country from 1970-1972. He is a terrorist but apparently he has a degree and is passionate about education reform. He holds the title of 'distinguished professor' at Illinois U in Chicago. It sickens me but this shows that many academic institutions favored leftist professors.|`|yzhinC6uaa	He was never convicted. So of course he never went to jail.|`|EcrCIqP7aa	They got him with an illegal wire tap.   But you have to remember the dems consider him a hero. He hates America enough to bomb it.    That is how he got to be a professor.|`|l2kD6XQ8aa	One, he waged war against the US as a political move to draw support against the Vietnam War.    Two, one of his former comrades was elected to Congress.    Three, he was never convicted.    Four, Robert Byrd, a member of the KKK, one of the worst extremist groups in America was elected to Congress.|`|r7r9K4yZaa	He was found not guilty of all charges. He was Chicago"s Man of the Year in 1997. Hardly the radical the Mccain Mongers want us to believe|`|0ZuHXUwFaa	Chicago is my kind of town, If you have enough money in Chicago and a theft you got it made,|`|Lelr1AQfaa	To me, it would be like giving Terry Nichols, the guy who was convicted for helping Timothy McVeigh in the Oklahoma City bombing, a prestigious job in education. I realize Ayers was never convicted, but I believe he did admit to helping with the bombings. Yes, people can change their ways, but they should still have to face the consequences of their bad behavior even if it is 40 years later.     BTW, the liberal colleges love guys like this! |`|deJ9df1iaa	Because he was qualified...    Obviously, Ayers takes quite an active role in society.|`|8OmL54xoaa	I have asked myself the same question. What in hell is going on with this country of ours, nobody is held accountable for their actions. There`s not only Ayers, theres the Wall St. crooks that get bailed out and we get to pay for all that money they squandered, but retirement pensions, college funds, etc., etc.maybe all gone. And the clowns in Congress like that rat looking Barney Franks, Chris Dodds, Chuck Shumer, Nancy Pelosi and the big fat liar Obama are busy blaming the Republicans for the things that they did. Not only did they want the $700,000,000. they also wanted those crooks from Chicago, Obama`s friends, the ACORN organisation to get $20,000,000.00 of that bailout money. What the hell has the ACORN group done that they should get even a penny of any of our tax money? These are the kind of things that really burns me up. Why the hell should Columbia University allow Ahbdinejab to give a speech in their campus, he is one of the terrorist who held American citizens hostage in Iran and if that wasn`t enough he goes around talking s!!t about our country and making threats against our country. Then there`s Obama saying that our soldiers are bombing villages and killing civilians in Irak, how come no one stands up to this lying megalomaniac and ask for some evidence to back up this kind of crap that he is accusing our sodiers of doing? These are very serious charges that he is talking about, there have been court martials conducted for lesser crimes let alone bombing a village and killing civilians. Where is the backbone of our country? Why are we allowing criminals in our college campuses, high schools, junior and elementary schools, teaching our children and poisoning our kids minds with their sick beliefs. Did you here about the cheerleaders that performed a skit in which they placed guns to the heads of some of the girls dressed-up with their opponents uniforms, then the dressed-up girls fall down on the floor like they are dead and the cheerleaders drag them off the floor. Who is responsible for these cheerleaders putting up this skit? It is sick, no wonder there are so many shootings and killings in our schools. Why do we allow for these kind of things to happen? How come we don`t demand these schools and colleges to fire these kind of people like Ayers and whoever let these cheerleaders do this sick skit? Why don`t we demand Congress or whoever in Washington to pay-off the pensions and college funds that so many Americans have lost because they did nothing to stop the reckless behaviour of the crooks on Wall St? Instead of paying them they should have just taken $1,000,000.00 and given it out to every American citizen, then there would be no financial crisis and we would have saved $400,000,000.00. They need to go,all of those crooks that get elected to serve the citizens of this country. What are they thinking? That we are all in some damn Monopoly game. Where is our outrage and our backbone that we just sit back and let all these clowns run our lives or rather RUIN our lives? Sorry for the rant, but I get very angry and sinserely hope that many more people ask the same question that you have asked and maybe do something about it.|`|dbf34ff38c532999837d513078fa22d0aa	Because universities are compounds for radical leftists.

6kUx7fwcaa	You are not going to make everyone happy, although happiness if overrated anyway.    I suspect that many of the entries against Obama I read here have a racial tone and the sense of guilt by association.  It almost sounds like the Republican dogma is that Lincoln, a Republican president who freed the slaves, did so in order to get them to leave.  Republicans, proud of their Christian majority, would have condemned Jesus Christ for eating with tax collectors and sinners, just as the Pharisees condemned him.    I wonder if people consider how they sound and think about their own thought critically, not just because they are against Obama, but even if they are against John McCain, because I think the hate speech and guilt by association really clouds the issue and I wonder what people are trying to hide, like the real issues.

For a Republican to endorse Obama, is further evidence that many won't tolerate extremist conservatives like McCain/Palin.This is also proof that the Obama campaign has tanked|`|AA11297448	No.  Dealing into the second deck of race cards now are we?|`|nYDElY0Eaa	Powell has lost any credibility that he may have had by endorsing Barack Hussein Obama.    Anyone that lets an endorsement by a person, a newspaper etc. is not very intelligent and unable to think for themselves. |`|axHyoVqGaa	I could possibly respect Powell's decision to support Obama, if he had given good reasons for doing so, but he hasn't from what I have seen and read so far. In one video he was talking about the Republican party and how it has moved to far to the right??? What??? I am not even a Republican, but I can see that the candidates put forth by republicans have moved to the center. Hell, for the early part of McCain's campaign, Republicans constantly accused him of being a Democrat, because of some of his more liberal views. In a news article, Powell made comments which basically stated that he was voting for Obama because he was concerned that McCain might appoint conservative judges??? Isn't that what the hell you would want if you have conservative beliefs?  Obama has been a very polarizing figure during this presidential campaign due to some statements he has made and because of some of his associations.  After eight years of Bush, the election should have been a slam dunk for a Democrat.  As it stand now, it could go either way.  This is evidence to anyone with half a brain, that Obama is not the great uniter that people make him out ot be.  I'm sorry, but Powell has made a very lame attempt at covering up his racist betrayal of his party and because of that, I have lost all respect for the man. He is showing his true colors, so to speak.  |`|e892d592fb4ab82ad6ca297b84e1704baa	Powell did not want to be investigated by the IRS and the FBI like joe the plumber who only asked about obama's tax plan.    This shows how innocent people will be dealt with if they disagree.|`|74654c35c0b749c9bd351db79db29bd3aa	No and this race thing is only going to be tolerated for so long. It is fuming the feelings of radicals on both sides of the issue. 
6QOKsVaPaa	I like Colin Powells endorsement its always good to know where people stand.  As for getting a few more votes for Obama Im sure he will sway a few.  As for Colin Powell saying it was hard to vote against his friend John McCain apparently not too hard.  I wish Colin Powell all the best but, he hasnt swayed me as I will vote for John McCain on Nov 4th.. |`|FcZU29W6aa	It will definitely improve his chances -- Colin Powell is a very respected, intelligent man, and this endorsement is going to be very helpful.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes it will by increasing Obama's electoral base by adding moderate Republican voters, all of which is good. However my only concern is that this might induce a more conservative stance in the name of unity|`|OFA2LAM5aa	It will drive a lot of independents and liberal Republicans to Obama.  |`|BUS5PJEmaa	I think it will improve his chances significantly. Powell's reasons were well thought out and clearly explained. He also gave good reasons not to vote for McCain. |`|6kUx7fwcaa	I think it will.  Even though Powell endorsed Obama's economic policies, it will also look as if Obama will have improved his ability to draw from significant people in the area of foreign affairs and the military.  Powell was a good negotiator and planner, as I believe Obama is.  I think it is what the country needs.|`|FvwmRtNjaa	Obama didn't need it, but yeah, probably.|`|82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	He is highly respected by many and is not known to be a hothead or rabidly open mouthed, so it might have an impact, but not sure that it is needed necessarily.     
tnagkORQaa	Yes yes I do; Colin Powell has always been a man of impeccable character and integrity despite his participation in the Bush Administration.  After he found out the Bush Administration played him for a fool with the manufactured evidence of WMDs in Iraq, he washed his hands of Bush and his fellow neo-conservatives with grace.    Colin Powells experience in global affairs makes him a man of sound judgment  especially in the field of choosing the right person for the right job.  Lets face it; you dont become the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, by choosing failures for important positions.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Definitely because all the Republicans are guilty of destroying the economy by not providing regulation for that not to happen. Obama on the other hand has plans which would make certain that this disaster is never repeated|`|1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	McCain is not going to do anything different to the standard conservative doctrine of a totally unfettered free market.  That's the only thing about economics that he understands.     Powell is a foreign policy expert, but even he understands the need for a change in thinking about the economy.|`|ZXkOQapLaa	I agree yes.|`|AA10289446	Yes. Obama is far better suited to handle America's economy than McCain. Mccain will continue Bush's failed policies. More economists have supported Obama over McCain.|`|jinAwMGNaa	Obama will give away our Country.  As far a Powell is concerned, he was a wimp in Vietnam, a wimp during the first Gulf War, and is still a Wimp.  And also, Blood is thicker than water... 
N6nnBuRyaa	Yes, I agree the Bush administration's policies have helped get us to the current crisis. I'm a regular reader of Krugman, who is a columnist for the New York Times. He is an Obama supporter.|`|rkRIYxi2aa	In terms of what got us into this mess there's plenty of blame to go around, for instance:    Regulatory oversight was relaxed by the Republicans.    Fannie and Freddy were enabled by the Democrats who allowed them to increase risk in their portfolios without being adequately capitalised.    And most importantly, the managements of banks and other financial institutions took on unreasonably risky assets for the sake of additional short term profits.    These last, the lax managements are, IMO, the primary villians who ran their organisations in a reckless manner and are now reaping the whirlwind.  We cannot reasonably expect govt to be a nanny for everything.    So, yes the Bush Administrtaion played a role, but so did many others.    I'm not a student of the Great Depression so I cannot comment on your B question  |`|6kUx7fwcaa	I believe the elements of the current crisis was set in motion by that icon of Republicans Ronald Reagan.  Washington's temporary occupants are too busy trying to make sure that they never have to go home involuntarily and maintain a position on the world stage to spend time overseeing anything or coming to reasonable decisions about anything important.  So we are stuck with these extreme fluctuations and rhetoric about people who are milking the system and correcting it by deregulating the capitalists until some get too greedy and cheat the system themselves.  The good ole boys are sleeping on the porch while the wolves of different colors raid the hen house.  Maybe the present crisis looks like the so-called Great Depression, but things have been worse and will be worse again.  Those guys just can't keep their eyes open and these crises are just excuses for raising more money to spend.
EJIDB2kIaa	No but there is truth that John Lewis and other Obama supporters want to keep race an issue in this election.  I am more disgusted with John Lewis' comments than I am with anything McCain or Palin have said.|`|LJLU5FZQaa	He is so correct.  Anyone who has seen a lynch mob or been in the deep South knows the violent  current that runs along the underbelly of white society in this country. As long as white privilege rules, fine...when poverty hits watch the uglies come out just like in any tribal situation.      And John Lewis is a person that Mc Cain most admires...one of the three so  hopefully name calling ( calling someone a terrorist because he was a community organizer on a board with someone who did violence when  Obama was 8 years old is really called guilt by association) of a destructive nature will end.  After all Kerry was swift boated in a very ruthlessly "polite" way.  Most real terrorists that have a public profile end up being water boarded at Gitmo.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	A great deal of truth. Paylin is inciting mobs based on that and other issues. The GOP ticket is reinventing McCarthyism,because they don't have any other issues to present to the voters. This issue was not even worthy of questions during the debate.Speak of terrorists: Mr and Mrs Paylin and the Alaska Independence Party, John Mc SAME, and the World Anti Communist League , sponsor of death squads. Their hypocrisy has no bounds.|`|AMTYPir7aa	they are not it is the people. neither of those candidates said obama was a terrorist only that he worked with a terrorist which is true. people also do not like the thought of socialist conforming which is something that has been happening for years. each and every time there is a crisis the government steps in and takes control what does that tell you. obama is for more bigger government mccain is for less government and so am i.|`|5TB3Q88gaa	Yes, Sarah Palin has been using the rhetoric that has feed the rallies (e.g. palling around with terrorists).  John McCain is responsible because it is his campaign and he needs to put America First and NOT allow slimy rhetoric.|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	no.  this is more political mumbo-jumbo partisan garbage.    but the FOLLOWERS of these campaigns are playing with fire, sticking their heads in the sand and doing anything necessary to get their candidate advanced.  this is dangerous on many levels.  what happened to reason, common sense, and realistic dialogue???|`|AfaFCiKxaa	There's a difference between sowing hatred and stirring up latent hatred.  Palin is definitely stirring that up, and she seems to enjoy doing it.|`|Lq4306a5aa	There's obviously truth.  Why don't you attack the people that Lewis is referring to as playing w/ fire?  Lewis is just reacting to their actions LEAD BY SARAH PALIN!!|`|PVcdO65Oaa	Only John Lewis a man who Legacy of fighting this  type of hatred and racism doing the civil right error as one of MLK lieutenants of the civil right movement could know about this he is really a Expert .I too have seen this growing up in the south as a young kid ,but never have i seen any presidential candidate out right incite racial tension turning Americans against Americans in a presidential race . I remember George Wallas very well and the hate he preach at everyone of his rallies there is not much different from a McCain /Palin kkk rally, so yes i agree with John Lewis.|`|P8aBAmHKaa	they are ralling the people to hate Obama and causing people to yell out hatful and racist comments I don't think they are racist but they are playing with fire|`|Oa2q6DFYaa	What Lewis perhaps meant is that the U.S. Supreme Court years ago held that Communist Party Membership does not support 'an inference that [one] does not have good moral character, absent any evidence that he even engaged in or abetted or supported any unlawful or immoral activities'.  There, the Court acknowledged the plaintiff wrote a series of articles criticizing 'this country's participation in the Korean War, the actions and policies of the leaders of the major political parties, the influence of big business in american life ... ' yet still gave individuals such as him the right to practice law.  On the flip side, there is ample evidence McCain gave aid or comfort to the enemy which, in turn, would have disqualified him from the practice of law, etc.

In 1999 Clinton was handed Bin Laden on a platter and said "thanks but no thanks" and let him go.    Two years later, right after he left office, our twin towers were vicioulsy attacked, killing our citizens over plain hatred for America.    So we had to go seek revenge- if you didn't know, it is costly to engage in war.  Then we realized we got in over our heads and had to expand our fight.    Next, the economy tanked after 9/11.  A proven way to help investment and spending is to cut taxes.  So Bush did what he had to do to keep the economy going.  Up until the democraps took control of congress and blocked regulation on Freddie and Fannie things weren't looking too bad.
6kUx7fwcaa	Well, let's see.  A company in my state is recording the lowest share price and the most profits in modern history.  What does that tell you?    It tells me that the economy is driven my greedy wimps who are more concerned with losing money than making money, but really the economy should not be run on the need for fulfilling greed needs, but the needs of consumers for goods!

Looks to me like he is really fearful....
aTAUOI8caa	To be fair, you've got to put details before I can read them.      And I don't think we should anymore.  It may have been necessary after World War II when we were afraid that allowing them a military would lead to a resurgence in their empire-building that would require we fight them down out of the Pacific again.    But they are now a democracy that is decidedly on our side, and we could use another ally in our foreign affairs; one with the ability to fight and not require us to protect them.    I believe the time has come to let Japan handle their own defense.|`|tDZMJue9aa	because japan can only have a military that can protect its land..nothing else...it cant be a world power as we are..its in the treaty from the war...read some history..and there arent any details in your question|`|lC5NLsZZaa	What the above has said + to maintain Japan as a strategic bulwark against an aggressor China or an aggressor Russia either by direct conflict or by proxy aggression through Kim Jong Il's North Korean regime.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	because one of the stipulations of the treaty we signed with them after dropping two nukes was that they were not to have a standing army.    |`|iVv6bFW2aa	They should not. Japan is a rich , capitalist country, which has not even had the decency to atone for their war crimes, and pay reparation to their victims, i.e occupied countries, the comfort women, Koreans etc. etc. They are xenophobic and also discriminate against immigrants, while people are starving in the US. Japan is now a servant of the US, re militarized and even sending soldiers for US adventures abroad.

I am capable of talking about this, AND the war, AND the economy, but apparently most democrats are incapable of doing so.    Bill ayers did not make any such comment.    Obama has TRIED to distance himself, but by doing so, he has outright lied.    In 1997, obama wrote a promotional blurb in the chicago tribune regarding ayers' book, which, if obama had read would have known about ayers terrorist dealings.  Obama since then worked with ayers for years.    It is now being reported that michelle obama worked at the same law firm as Bill Ayers' wife in the 1980's.|`|qo2u1BCoaa	Why in the world would he do this? He is not an elected official.

WNuxNjeOaa	He has nothing to offer. |`|AA10265144	John McCain has a strong record of working across the aisle to reform how business is done in Washington. Throughout his career of public service, John McCain has worked across party aisles with Republicans and Democrats alike to reform our campaign finance system, confirm qualified judges like Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Sam Alito, and enhance our homeland security. He spoke out against his own party's out-of-control spending, against the Administration to change a failing strategy in Iraq, and against an energy bill that was full of giveaways to Big Oil companies.   |`|WOw84q5Laa	He is more qualified for the job than   Obama is period    Pretty simple|`|d37fce1f60422d1680aaf24987c3be32aa	i wouldn't |`|2P18wyECaa	Because when someone says something damaging to John McCain (Like Arab Lady) he doesn't then start a smear campaign against them.

I mean WTH???|`|6iRrlATraa	Well, John McCain is the only candidate who has an actual track record of accomplishments to back up all his campaign promises. Further, he is for drastic cuts in spending which is absolutely necessary to get our economy moving back in a good direction. He also has extensive Foreign Policy experience which is vital as we face two wars.     Plainly, McCain is only the candidate who is qualified to lead our great nation during these perilous days.|`|U8ORYrMEaa	Only if somebody put a gun to my head.|`|LJd5pUkuaa	Never!|`|hz2nFhVEaa	there is no reason i would|`|5Wc1vDshaa	Racism would make you consider McSame.

He is a war hero who I believe will be a better commander in chief. His tax plan is less socialist. He cringes at universal health care, which is not a good idea. Finally, he can actually answer a question and keep that same answer for more than a 24-hour period of time.|`|UmeQjw72aa	McCain is not a socialist like purple lips. He doesn't believe in wealth redistribution. He also seems more like a family man he adopted 3 and has 4 of his own. He also doesn't hate the color of my skin which is white|`|joh3VNcZaa	Because he has more experience in foreign policy than Obama, and with Iran and Russia and Venezuela that is going to be really important really soon.  This is especially true when dealing with these countries.  There is evil out there and he will stand up to it when he sees it (come on Obama. When Russia invaded Georgia without provocation you said it was both of their faults).    Because Obama wants to expand both the size and intrusiveness of the federal government.  Name one thing the government does well.  Can't?  Then why give them more power?    Because Obama's punitive tax policies will push us further into a recession.  When you raise taxes on the top percent, the tax revenue actually goes down. When Bush's tax cuts went into effect, the amount of revenue the top 1% of wage earners paid went up 2% even though the marginal tax rate dropped. Thats because when you let people keep their money they invest it and grow the economy.    He wants to raise taxes on businesses too. When you do this, that means the cost of doing business goes up. The response is to shrink payrolls (layoffs and no raises) and raise prices. Who pays for that? We do as consumers and employees.     Lastly, he wants to raise the capital gains tax. When you do that, you discourage investment in the market. The current economic crisis is because of a loss of liquidity in banks because of the economic mess due to bad loans.    Here is an example of how interfering with the markets works. Clinton revised the Community Reinvestment Act and required banks to make bad loans or face fines and prosecution Citibank was sued by the firm Obama worked for because they held back on this). So they did, even though they knew these loans wouldn't be paid back.   |`|LjiExIU1aa	I'm an independent through and through.

o3sYIdOzaa	Yes, he wants to cut health care to provide health care. doesn't make much sense.  He wants to cut Medicare and Medicaid by $1.3 trillion.  He wants to give a $5,000 tax credit and tax employer funded health care, so when employers drop employees, it will cost employees not $5,000 but $12,000 for health care, so everybody loses.    The Journal reported that McCain would cut Medicare and Medicaid funding by $1.3 trillion dollars over the next decade --  based on estimates by independent analysts -- and use those savings to fund tax credits to help people purchase health coverage. The paper said the campaign had not given a specific figure for the cuts, but did not dispute the analysts' estimate.    Two battleground state surrogates, former Florida Sen. Bob Graham and Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, hosted the call. Both states have large populations of elderly voters.     Medicare and Medicaid serve seniors, the disabled and the poor. Graham said McCains plan would be disastrous for the oldest, the poorest and the sickest Americans, and would hurt state budgets.    This plan would be a disaster. It would cut Medicare and Medicaid by over 20 percent over the next 10 years. It would dramatically reduce quality of health care for older Americans and the poorest and sickest of Americans, while at the same time adding to the burden of state governments, he said. Under Medicaid there is  a set of benefits that are legally required of the state to provide. If the federal government reduces its level of support then that is just more of a burden that states  which are already in an extremely overextended basis  will have to pick up.    Casey said some 2.2 million older Pennsylvanians served by Medicare and 1 million children served by Medicaid would be adversely affected by McCains proposal.    What this health care plan indicates is that John McCain is out of touch with what Americans are going through. People are struggling as they never have before with this economy, he said. You have to wonder about what John McCain and his running mate, what their priorities are for America. Privatizing Social Security, gutting Medicare, deregulating health care is not putting country first, its putting radical, misguided, reckless ideology ahead of the interests of your country and ahead of the interests of families in America, especially older citizens and very vulnerable Americans.|`|0lV2C78xaa	McCain wants to expand it. He wants to make more community clinics and what not.|`|AA10910418	 If that's what McCain's plan will cost................think of how   much more Obama's health plan for everyone will cost.

EBXvl6Foaa	TO ALL MY FRIENDS....LIBERAL OR CONSERVATIVE..FYI only.        Geor.ge Bush has been in office for 7 1/2 years. The first six the economy was fine.    A little over one year ago:   1) Consumer confidence stood at a 2 1/2 year high;   2) Regular gasoline sold for $2.19 a gallon;   3) the unemployment rate was 4.5%.   4) the DOW JONES hit a record high--14,000 +   5) American's were buying new cars,taking cruises, vacations overseas, living large!...     But American's wanted CHANGE! So, in 2006 they voted in a Democratic Congress and yes--we got CHANGE all right. In the PAST YEAR:     1) Consumer confidence has plummeted;   2) Gasoline is now over $4 a gallon & climbing!;   3) Unemployment is up to 5.5% (a 10% increase);   4) Americans have seen their home equity drop by $12 TRILLION DOLLARS and prices still dropping;   5) 1% of American homes are in foreclosure.   6) as I write, THE DOW is probing another low~~  $2.5 TRILLION DOLLARS HAS EVAPORATED FROM THEIR STOCKS, BONDS & MUTUAL FUNDS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS!     YES, IN 2006 AMERICA VOTED FOR CHANGE...AND WE SURE GOT IT! ....        REMEMBER THE PRESIDENT HAS NO CONTROL OVER ANY OF THESE ISSUES, ONLY CONGRESS.        AND WHAT HAS CONGRESS DONE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.        NOW THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT CLAIMS HE IS GOING TO REALLY GIVE US CHANGE--ALONG WITH A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS!!        JUST HOW MUCH MORE CHANGE DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAND?    VOTE FOR MCCAIN!! |`|3iZJ4o2maa	I agree with you Juliet,  You actually stated facts while other people are just saying oh Obama's better than McCain when they don't even know the facts, because if they did, they would clearly see that Obama is not better than McCain.    Let me tell you one thing Obama voters... Obama doesn't keep his word, and if you dont believe me, look at his records. The only reason he was elected to be the state Senator of Illinois, was because no one was running against him.     This election will change your lives and the generations after you. So before you vote, get your facts right.     McCain is the way to go! And if your wondering why so many people like Obama so much, it's because he tells them what they want to hear. And i guarantee that Obama will not keep his word on everything he has told America. Not everyone likes what McCain says, but hes not lying to the world to get them to like him. If you like what he believes, great, if you dont thats to bad, but John McCain will keep his word.    So please, do not follow the world on what's popular, because the only thing that has gotten us so far is high school students having a problem with drugs, alcohol, and unwanted pregnancies for many young girls because of whats popular. So dont get caught in the pressures of following everyone else, because as you can see, that hasnt gotten us very far.     So walk in your own foot steps, and vote for John McCain. |`|AA10026633	Obama. McCain wants to stay in Iraq for as long as it takes while I Obama I believe is going to pull out by 2011? I'm not quite sure though. Obama is much smarter for this job and I suggest that you go with him.|`|AA11622701	If you are concerned about the economy, and the mess it is in because of the Sub Prime Mortagage collopse, consider the following.    Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (the two large mortgage companies that collapsed) both have given hundreds of thousands of dollar to Obama. Apparently they believe that he would be the one who would best continue the policies that got them into the current mess.    The last two CEOs of Fannie Mae (Franklin Raines and Jimmy Johnson) are part of the Obama campaign.  Raines is the person advising Obama on econmics issues, and Johnson was the one who headed the committee that picked Biden as VIP.    Barak Obama was a lawyer for ACORN, the group that lobbied for the reforms that allowed the Sub Prime lending, and pressed the government to encourage giving mortgages to "anyone" whether they had the means to repay or not.  That is the main cause of the current collapse.    I question the wisdom of having a President who has the support of the people who actually committed the acts that have caused the current economic crises, hires them as his advisors, and worked for them in the past....|`|fdgCPDLlaa	if you are tired of business-as-usual politics, vote for Obama.    If you want more of the same crap continued from the Bush years (not to mention a very SCARY VP), vote for McCain.  |`|l2kD6XQ8aa	McCain is reckless and erratic.

Let's face facts; they both will make election promises and platforms, but after they get in office, if Congress doesn't back them up and legislate their promises, the promises fade away into vapor.  They will then say, "Well, I tried, but Congress wouldn't work with me".  Since Congress is currently controlled by the Democrats, I would suggest voting for McCain to balance the power.  |`|IJ75DUkEaa	It depends.  Obama IS a socialist.  Redistribution of wealth is socialist.  McCain is also socialist, but to a lesser extent.      So, if you would like to decrease the incentive to work hard and make money, go ahead and vote for Obama.  If you would prefer to pay more in taxes, go ahead and vote for Obama.  If you would prefer to see your income go in the form of federal taxes instead of sales taxes, vote for Obama.  If you want to see America re new the foreign policies of the Carter administration, vote for Obama.|`|AA12261133	Obama.  He's going to help you the most with his tax cuts, seeing as you're middle class.   edit:  wtf Mike T.  nice play, talking about his middle name.  mature.    his name is his name.  that doesn't mean he's like Saddam.    Bush's middle name is Walker.   That doesn't mean he's like Walker Texas Ranger, now does it?|`|64023a28dd1eb3b4912d4ee44c519f4caa	Obama.  Because he actually talks about the issues.  Whereas McCain and his followers try to play the "fear game" while avoiding talking about any issues.  For example when is the last time you heard McCain talk about issues?  It's been a while.  All you have heard is fear mongering like people using his middle name(like Mike T. above) and calling him Muslim.  Thank god a majority of Amercians are smarter than that.|`|1u6QiHCTaa	I don't think either one will, in actuality, effect you much.    If you look at his track record, Obama is more likely to increase taxes (although if you asked him to his face, he'd tell you he won't). If you're against the war, his plus is that he wants to pull out as soon as possible.    McCain is more likely to actually decrease spending, and he seems to be very confident in his ability with numbers. While I don't think he will get as much done as he thinks he will, I think he will be better at actually getting our budget to a place it should be. If you are for the war, his plus is that he wants to stay.|`|gpymeJ48aa	You should make that decision on your own.

George Bush does the same and his father before him and still makes errors!! Now watch Obama... see him looking at notes??? NO WAY, he has it in his head and speaks like he knows what HE is saying and not what has been written for him! Now go back and look at Clinton and even Kennedy before that...again NO NOTES! What does this tell you other that the difference in possible IQs. I was once stated that the two Bush's, Senior and Junior had a combined IQ of less than that of Clinton alone. I once heard of Clinton being described as "The Pr*ck between 2 Bushes"...He would wear that description with pride!!

Yes on 8 advocates are making accusations that because a church may refuse to perform the ceremony, they can be sued or lose their tax exemption, which most authorities have already said publicly wouldn't happen.  But it's a scare tactic they're using.  |`|3EyK4x2Naa	But this is harming someone. Its harming the people in same sex marriage. This isn't just about churches loosing their tax exempt status. This is about orphanigies refusing to adopt a child to a married gay couple, about teaching tolerance to gays in schools, and much more.  There has to be separation from church and state.   The religions cannot discriminate against gays with the help of the government. Why would parents want their kids to be sheltered from whats going on in the world?   I applaud Massachusetts for their steps toward equality. I am proud to be from SF where Gavin Newsom has been the voice in politics for the homosexuals who deserve their rights.   When I was in school I was taught about segregation, civil rights and women's suffrage. I find it incredible that I'm alive to see this happening and children will be learning about this in their history classes years from now. This is the civil rights movement of our generation.  Also, I'd like to bring up the fact that years and years ago when segregation was banned, churches, restaurants, etc didn't like the idea of schools mixing races, eventually with time, people got over it. People will get over this too. Some of us already have.   By the way, I'm straight so I'm not just saying this as if I was in the position of a gay. I'm saying this because I truly believe in the equality for all people, all over. I know I'll probably get thumbs down for this, but I don't care. NO ON PROP 8

This turned me against him, not skin color, not party, not religion, but being non- American. No one should be in charge of something they do not believe in. That would be like putting a general in charge of your army who thought that your enemy was right. If you don't believe in a thing, you can not support it, and you absolutely can't help it.   How many times will this be asked? It's about 20 days until the election, so, I'll wager, at least 20 times or more.

It is true however, he does look different - liberal, close-minded, attacks Capitalism (like the World Trade Center Bombers intended to do), and embraces Socialism.

KS1982|`|9XEEmqDCaa	No.      I am a white 40-year old man, and I am voting for Barack Obama because he has the temperment and judgement to lead this country.  He also has an inspiring vision that I like in my nation's leaders.  Joe Biden also has those qualities.  He just happens to be white.  McCain and Palin are significantly lacking in those qualities, and I, personally, can't relate to anyone who would vote for those two.    I think that people who can't get past the race issue, in politics and in mainstream life, are not worthy of respect any longer, in this age.  They deserve to be left behind, in America's unfortunate past.      I don't think (necessarily) that McCain or Palin are racist.  I think that some may come to the conclusion that McCain is racist, based on his treatment of Obama in the first two debates (wouldn't look at him in the first, called him "that one" in the second, etc.), but I don't think that he is.  Though, sometimes those views are ingrained, I think, depending on what generation you are from.  He definitely grew up in an America that had strong racial divisions.  I won't say that Palin is racist, although I have read about an incident where, allegedly, she referred to Obama as "Sambo" earlier this year, in a restaurant in Alaska.  I'm not sure there is any proof that she said that, but the article I was reading also points out that Alaska is a very white state and that forms of racism in general, especially against Eskimos, is not uncommon.

And, yes, I have been threatened with bodily harm.    In terms of the economy, both candidates do not have a clue.  So, I see that it does not matter.  Either candidate will screw that up.  Only someone like Warren Buffett or Michael Bloomberg will fix what ails this country.    Obviously, from the down arrow, you are OK with someone wishing me bodily harm.

Except that it was not a debate. Biden answered the questions but Palin did not.  Palin repeated the talking points of her campaign appearances.  She herself said that she was not going to answer the questions but that she was going to talk to the American people directly.  That is a campaign speech given in installments, it is not a debate.  She hurt herself by not trying to point to the differences between Mccain and Bush. She hurt herself by not debating but by parroting her talking points. 
DvQLt59Paa	Democrats are the ones injecting race into everything. Divide and conquer.|`|9PAavWnyaa	The whole country is not obsessed with race. If you are sick of hearing about race, then why this question?|`|3Es2WLa1aa	lol i became obsessed when i first seen Sarah|`|PVcdO65Oaa	Am i my brother keeper          Too often we honor swagger and bluster and the wielders of force; too often we excuse those who are willing to build their own lives on the shattered dreams of others. Some Americans who preach nonviolence abroad fail to practice it here at home. Some who accuse others of inciting riots have by their own conduct invited them.     Some look for scapegoats, others look for conspiracies, but this much is clear; violence breeds violence, repression brings retaliation, and only a cleaning of our whole society can remove this sickness from our soul.     For there is another kind of violence, slower but just as deadly, destructive as the shot or the bomb in the night. This is the violence of institutions; indifference and inaction and slow decay. This is the violence that afflicts the poor, that poisons relations between men because their skin has different colors. This is a slow destruction of a child by hunger, and schools without books and homes without heat in the winter.     This is the breaking of a mans spirit by denying him the chance to stand as a father and as a man among other men. And this too afflicts us all. I have not come here to propose a set of specific remedies nor is there a single set. For a broad and adequate outline we known what must be done. When you teach a man to hate and fear his brother, when you teach that he is a lesser man because of his color or his beliefs or the policies he pursues, when you teach that those who differ from you threaten your freedom or your job or your family, then you also learn to confront others not as fellow citizens but as enemies  to be met not with cooperation but with conquest, to be subjugated and mastered.     We learn, at the last, to look at our bothers as aliens, men with whom we share a city, but not a community, men bound to us in common dwelling, but not in common effort. We learn to share only a common fear  only a common desire to retreat from each other  only a common impulse to meet disagreement with force. For all this there are no final answers.     Yet we know what we must do. It is to achieve true justice among our fellow citizens. The question is now what programs we should seek to enact. The question is whether we can find in our own midst and in our own hearts that leadership of human purpose that will recognize the terrible truths of our existence.     We must admit the vanity of our false distinctions among men and learn to find our own advancement in the search for the advancement of all. We must admit in ourselves that our own childrens future cannot be built on the misfortunes of others. We must recognize that this short life can neither be ennobled or enriched by hatred or revenge.     Our lives on this planet are too short and the work to be done too great to let this spirit flourish any longer in our land. Of course we cannot vanish it with a program, nor with a resolution.     But we can perhaps remember  even if only for a time  that those who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us the same short movement of life, that they seek  as we do  nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.     Surely this bond of common faith, this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something. Surely we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men and surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our hearts brothers and countrymen once again.     *********************     |`|LZuEYMQBaa	Yes I am sick of it.  I was sick of it from day one.    Obama is black.  HOLD THE PRESSES!    News flash:  I am sure Obama knows that he is black.      I wish people would look at the issues as well.

It is a good thing that our country is obsessed with this presidential race.  Hopefully, they become informed and involved.  Hopefully, they are conducting research to case a vote that comes from being informed not ignorance.      When someone says something stupid like you have been hearing, ask them about the issues.  If they are ignorant, then guide them to campaign web sites so that they can draw their own conclusions.      Personally for me, Obama has the answers for the issues I feel are important.  My daughter is 21 and she didn't know who to vote for.  I gave her web sites that convey the platforms for each candidate.  I wanted her to research and draw her own conclusions.  I raised her as a conservative Republican.  After she did her research, she told me that she would just have to vote for Obama.  She didn't have a clue as to whom I was voting for.  I asked her why and she had valid reasons why she is casting her vote.  She could respond intelligently and informed.   I know that there are individuals that can respond intelligently and informed that are voting for McCain as well.  I have talked to them. Their views match those of McCain.  The key is being informed and applying that information to your own personal beliefs.     One must know the issues and know the candidates views on those issues.  Vote for the candidate that best fits your views.  Informed voters stay clear of all the propaganda available by the truck load.|`|PljHDAqgaa	Obama is a socialist,comunist left wingwacko.......!!!!!!!|`|QnNc0Vklaa	I'm tired of talking to Obama supporters and I tell all the reasons I like McCain, his energy policy, Iraq, Terrorism, Healthcare, and their only amswer is, "Oh, you must be racist". No, I'm voting for the better candidate, and I'm tired of being called racist because I like McCain, but these people do not know anything on any of Obama's policies. That is racist to vote for Obama just because its trendy to vote for the black guy. |`|a17dbb97dcaf53a8580de45946318642aa	Because there's a black man running for president and there's a woman running for vice president that men want to take to bed.  People keep talking about experience but on either side there's enough experience.  On the Rep side John McCain is the one with the most experience (and age) and on the Dem side Joe Biden is the one with the most experience (and age).  If you vote for John McCain, you're supporting the idea that Sarah Palin could run the country.  If you vote for Obama, you're supporting the idea that Joe Biden could run the country.  Sorry but I don't want Sarah Palin anywhere near the White House.  We do need to focus on the issues, so please tell her to stop winking to  the cameras.|`|fwHHEdZRaa	I'm sick of this as well.

How do they keep all their money? Loopholes called trusts, charity, and other little hideaway places they can stow their fortunes.    If he raises taxes on the "rich", the rich are smart enough to know how to move their money around to avoid any hurt by it.     And you think you're really going to pay lower taxes under Obama?? Think about it this way, if a business gets taxed more, then they pass that down to you through the goods you buy...so a 3% increase on businesses means almost a 15% increase in prices of goods you buy. Everything a business buys gets taxed higher because they buy from other businesses that have been taxed higher, so they pass it down to you the consumer....following this or it is too much for you?    So claiming Obama's intention is to make it better for the little guy, is crap. Obama has made it very clear, he want's redistribution of wealth...so you better hope you do NOT succeed because he'll be dipping further into your pockets to spread it around for you!  |`|AA12261133	because it's the fair thing to do.|`|cexej2KAaa	Because he's a true patriot.

Obama is sure of his financial situation and knows that the working class Americans need a break.|`|16ng0ir5aa	Because he can afford it, and knows it's right. The middle class is being crushed by this crisis, true the rich are being affected but they are not worrying about whether to pay the mortgage or the electric company.     Personally I think it would stimulate the economy more.  When wealthy people get more money during a crisis what do you think they'll do with it?  The smart thing to do would be to save it, they're not going to go on a wild spending spree just because McCain gives them huge tax cuts.     On the other hand, with Obama giving much more in tax cuts to the middle class; I believe it will result in much more money being pumped into the economy. They would spend it much more than the rich because they have to.

fShlKEfYaa	If you marry an illegal immigrant in CA and they get deported, what happens financially depends on what the married partners decide to do about their marriage.  If there is a valid marriage license, the marriage can be legal and fully in effect, which has nothing to do with the person's immigration status inthe USA. It is a good idea to have a pre-nuptial agreement. Consult with an attorney in your state.    If they decide to stay married, then they can make the decision what to do with finances. If they decide to divorce, the California divorce laws apply to the finances. Spouses can engage US attorneys ( while outside the US) to handle the divorce and settlements arrangements. This might include alimony in California. A spouse may have the option to move to the country where their spouse is deported.     Child-custody issues often arise if an Asian spouse cannot stay in the U.S. and instead wants to relocate back to Asia. The legal standard for an award of custody by a family court judge is the best interest of the child test. Under the law, no maternal or paternal preference exists, but the primary caretaker parent often has an advantage  |`|08f414c8d1ee0d9e0d572bac4310a736aa	Deportation doesn't void marriage.  It just makes it impossible to live together in the same country.  Now, the US citzen can file for divorce, if he and she wants, and it's subject to the normal rules.  The deportee just can't easily collect what the US spouse won't send.|`|WtvpReidaa	But if you married them, wouldn't they get permanent residency? They wouldn't be deported in the first place.|`|11e8350ec258efaccc286e4e5758b9bfaa	If you are residing in CA, then community property rules are in effect, as to marital assets. Each spouse has the right to use or dispose of the community property items at will, during the course of the marriage. Only upon dissolution of the marriage shall community property assets be divided, with 50% given to each spouse. Your separate property, i.e. property accumulated before marriage, property acquired through bequest/will/gift, property gifted by the other spouse, et al is not subject to division upon dissolution of marriage.     Issues may arise as to whether certain community property has been transmuted into separate property by the words and actions of the giving spouse, and vice versa. Or so I remember from my Community Property class over 10 years ago.    I recommend consulting an attorney in the family law field for proper advise.      |`|U9bQgfY9aa	The rule that you can marry a foreigner and they can get US residency only applies if they are in the USA legally. If they are here illegally, this does not apply. The illegal has to leave the USA and wait 10 years before they can apply to come back legally.    And the couple can live together if she emigrates to his home country.    And if the spouse in California decided to keep everything, unless their deported spouse could afford lawyers, they are out of luck.      
b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	In a perfect world, "civil unions" would be the phrase for any couple seeking a legal arrangement in the eyes of the government, while "marriage" would pertain only to a religious ceremony. In such circumstances, the religion could marry anyone they want.    But it's not a perfect world. Laws have been written to give rights to "married couples."

Bush came into office and was handed an economic disaster aka 9/11. What short memory the democrats have. Included  also,that what  you just addressed with your question.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	The Clinton Administration was the first one to declare that lending practices were discriminatory.  They forced banks to re-evaluate all loan rejections on the the basis of race, which was a good idea.  But instead of just making sure that minorities with good credit were treated fairly, they continued the process to include unqualified borrowers.  The program, which at first did help reduce discriminatory practices against qualified buyers, ballooned out of control where anyone no matter how bad of a credit risk they were, got loans.     Because of the demand for housing, prices sky-rocketed, and people borrowed against over-inflated equity.  Fannie and Freddie went wild with speculations, financed more and more unqualified buyers, and you know the rest of the story.  Housing bubble burst, and we are in the position we are today.    Although the Clinton administration at first had good intentions to eliminate existing discrimination, they sat back and watched their program filter into the risk category while strong-arming banks to make bad loans.  In essence they are to blame, although after the snowball started downhill, many others including congress and the present administration did little or nothing to warn of the consequences or to stop it.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	I don't think so.

Government has a vested interest in keeping the economy growing, or at least presenting the idea that it is. They created legislation which not only allowed these practices, but also encouraged them. Then they engaged in a systematic pattern of stone walling all attempts to rectify inequities and ignored warnings of a potential crash.    Business also has to shoulder their share. They allowed themselves either by acceptance or bullying, depending on who you choose to believe, to engage in a destructive pattern. They made loans to unqualified applicants based on easy terms and  government assurance that their losses would be covered. When it became evident that this practice was leading to a distastrous position they did not change their tactics, but rather began to cover-up the discrepancies.    Individuals are also not blameless. People must live within their means. Anyone with have a lick of sense knows they cannot pay a mortgage if they have no or very low income. Additionally it is encumbant on each of tus hat we familiarize ourselves with the terms, conditions and possible ramifications of the agreements we choose to enter into. In short, it was neither the fault of government or business that these people could not make their payments. These entities are culpable for even the possibility that such could occur.    So as you can probably see at this point, I do not believe that the fault rests in a single place, but is rather a series of bad decisions cascading down from the government level to the individual.|`|5KCGmX4Uaa	the truth is: americans need to go on a diet. then they wouldn't spend all their money on food!!!!

That encouraged agencies such as ACORN to jump in and pressure banks into pushing those products which then filtered into the entire mortgage market.   These "challenged" loans were then packaged up as mortgage backed securities and all of this waited for the ball to hit bottom which occured when the market finally exhauseted itself from hyper house price inflation resulting from an unnatural increase in demand and increase in refinancing demand as people started to get into trouble.  Kaboom!    Even this kids gets it:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncqqr1BFV...|`|fnwvuHeJaa	the community reinvestment act, from jimmy carter to recent times is to blame.

And the democrats point fingers?|`|r7r9K4yZaa	Yes, he's partly to blame. He's always been Republican lite anyway. What sealed our fate is when in October, 2002 Bush brought foreward a plan to help minority people to "afford homes" and directed Fannie Mae to make no down payment home loans available to all. This increased home ownership by 5 million families. Now, we are told that about 5 million homes are in foreclosure.|`|QO1H9AeTaa	I'd say the crisis had more to do with Congress than the Executive branch over anything else, which at the time was a Republican Majority in both House and Senate.    This happened around the same time they were diverting our attention on another little "scandal" that has absolutely no relevance now, and impeachment hearings were distracting us from the real proposals that were happening in Washington at the time.     We should've took the surplus and started researching alternative fuel sources that would have created jobs instead of sinking it into the only market that made money at the time, which was housing.   But that's right; at that time, Global Warming was still considered a myth by most Republicans.    Hindsight is indeed 20/20.|`|AA11992587	During the housing boom, many people were able to obtain loans to buy homes or refinance and cash out their equity.  The underlying premise was that people were doing well in this country and could generally afford this.  In fact, people were not doing anywhere near as good as was estimated by the fed and the banks.  The money at the top of the food chain did not trickle down, it flooded overseas.  Good paying jobs and benefit packages were pared down because many companies found that they could get the service or product overseas with cheap labor and then bring the product over and sell it without paying any kind of tariff or penalty for not using American labor to produce the goods.  This was all justified on the grounds that doing business this way resulted in lower prices to consumers.  The trade off was job and financial security for American workers.  All it required for many families to drown in debt was for one earner to get ill or lose their job.  Deregulation did not help.  It should be noted that while these banks are  going broke now,  they were making money when the loans were made.  They knew that many of these borrowers were not going to be able to pay, especially in the sub prime arena.  Even when interest rates on mortgages dropped to 5% for prime borrowers, these banks were putting borrowers with bad credit in deals with interest rates as high as 13%.  Many were promised that they would be refinanced at a lower rate after they paid the mortgage in a timely fashion during the teaser rate period.  They would then be allowed to refinance at a lower rate before the new rate hit.  They were also qualified for these loans based on the teaser rate.  It was generally understood that the borrower would not be able to pay the higher rates in effect after the teaser period expired.  I think many of the banks who bought up these loans felt like they were safe because with everyone doing so well economically, the demand for houses and their prices would continue to go up thereby providing a measure of security in terms of the collateral.  Deregulation of lending standards in a nutshell is what caused this crises.  Regulation would have imposed lending standards based on the true financial condition of the borrower.  Many of the banks were only looking for the short term gain obtained by putting people in these loans.  They probably figured if they got in real financial trouble, they would be bailed out by the taxpayer.  And they might be right if this bailout goes through.  Reagan, Clinton and the Bushes did nothing to help the situation.  They all were supporters of World Trade and NAFTA.  They are all to blame for this mess which was inevitable once job and financial security for the middle class was sacrificed for cheaper production prices overseas.  Biden was right about one thing last night.  The middle class is the vehicle for economic prosperity.  If they do well, everyone does well.  Right now the middle class is being destroyed in this country.  When I grew up in the 60s and 70s, just about everyone in the neighborhood I grew up in owned a small successful business, had just one person working, had a big family with two cars and the cost of education and health care was not really a factor.  The answer to this crises is to get small businesses back in the game.  We are currently a nation run by corporations who have made small businesses obsolete.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	the real culprit is  capitalism, which is to be blamed. as Keynes famous economist stated, the vicious business cycles called boom and depression are inevitable in capitalist countries. in boom, the capitalists produce more goods and dump in the market for which there would be lesser buyers. it leads to depression. that is why the sales of automobiles came down as there are no takers as there is no purchasing power in the hands of the middle class, which further leads to job losses. the solution for present global financial crisis is to  have some regulations by the government.

I have serious reservations about their leadership and where they could possibly take America in the future. Comparatively, at least Bush and Clinton's respective regimes had serious validation from the Americans but these present candidates, McCain and Obama, Palin et al, it's like more of "Palin who?" and "What can they do?" I mean essentially, this coming November US elections will be like making forced choices. Because there's no one else. .. better? God bless America.

Sure, he says he'll lower taxes for Americans and collect higher taxes from large corporations instead... but this will in effect have a trickling down effect on the economy.

It means state ownership of those things that normally are privately owned. We are currently practicing socialism in very subtle forms such as bank ownership by governments. Now some dems want 401k ownership and regualtion thoguh govt. Thats socialism.      Obama wants further state intervention and control of govt through regulation and ownership of the financial industry and mortgage industry.He wants socialized health care, more money for failing schools. He wants more welfare funds to keep people dependent on the govt. He wants regulation of free speech through "fairness" doctrine.

Under Mr. McCains plan, the cut would be $700.    The difference is greater if the couples income is just $35,000. Under Mr. Obamas plan they would get a tax cut of $1,400, under Mr. McCains less than $500.    The contrast is even more striking in the upper reaches of income. A couple with two children and two incomes who earn $1.5 million would see a tax increase of more than $75,000 under Mr. Obamas plan, but a cut of about $300 under Mr. McCains.    http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/04/us/pol...|`|9ZiqmgGzaa	he has openly admitted to wanting to redistribute wealth that is socialism|`|7OlYowmYaa	He wants to take money from people who earned it so that he can give it to people who didn't earn it for no reason other than "social fairness".

JERUSALEM  Evidence has emerged that Sen. BarackObama belonged to a socialist political party that sought to elect members to public office with the aim of moving the Democratic Party far leftward to ultimately form a new political party with a socialist agenda.    Several blogs, including Powerline, previously documented that while running for the Illinois stateSenate in 1996 as a Democrat, Obama actively sought and received the endorsement of the socialist-oriented New Party, with some blogs claiming Obama was a member of the controversial party.    The New Party, formed by members of the Democratic Socialists for America and leaders of an offshoot of the Community Party USA, was an electoral alliance that worked alongside the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or ACORN. The New Party's aim was to help elect politicians to office who espouse its policies.    Among New Party members was linguist and radical activist Noam Chomsky.    Obama's campaign has responded to the allegations, denying the presidential candidate was ever a member of the New Party.    But the New Zeal blog dug up print copies of the New Party News, the party's official newspaper, which show Obama posing with New Party leaders, list him as a New Party member and include quotes from him              The party's Spring 1996 newspaper boasted: "New Party members won three other primaries this Spring in Chicago: Barack Obama (State Senate), Michael Chandler (Democratic Party Committee) and Patricia Martin (Cook County Judiciary). The paper quoted Obama saying "these victories prove that small 'd' democracy can work."    The newspaper lists other politicians it endorsed who were not members but specifies Obama as a New Party member.      Barack Obama pictured in New Party publication (Courtesy New Zeal blog)    New Ground, the newsletter of Chicago's Democratic Socialists for America, reported in its July/August 1996 edition that Obama attended a New Party membership meeting April 11, 1996, in which he expressed his gratitude for the group's support and "encouraged NPers (New Party members) to join in his task forces on Voter Education and Voter Registration."    Becoming a New Party member requires some effort on behalf of the politician. Candidates must be approved by the party's political committee and, once approved, must sign a contract mandating they will have a "visible and active relationship" with the party.    The New Party, established in 1992, took advantage of what was known as electoral "fusion," which enabled candidates to run on two tickets simultaneously, attracting voters from both parties. But the New Party went defunct in 1998, one year after fusion was halted by the Supreme Court.    Following the initial reports of Obama's purported membership in the New Party, Obama associate and former Chicago New Party activist Carl Davidson posted a statement on several blogs claiming his former party was not socialist, but he admitted it worked with ACORN.    "[The New Party] was a pragmatic party of 'small d democracy' mainly promoting economic reforms like the living wage and testing the fusion tactic, common in many countries but only operational in New York in the U.S. The main trend within it was ACORN, an Alinskyist outfit, which is hardly Marxist," wrote Davidson.    But the socialist goals of the New Party were enumerated on its old website.    Among the New Party's stated objectives were "full employment, a shorter work week, and a guaranteed minimum income for all adults; a universal 'social wage' to include such basic benefits as health care, child care, vacation time, and lifelong access to education and training; a systematic phase-in of comparable worth and like programs to ensure gender equity."    The New Party stated it also sought "the democratization of our banking and financial system  including popular election of those charged with public stewardship of our banking system, worker-owner control over their pension assets, community-controlled alternative financial institutions."    Many of the New Party's founding members were Democratic Socialists for America leaders and members of Committees of Correspondence, a breakaway of the Communist Party USA. Obama attended several DSA events and meetings, including a DSA-sponsored town hall meeting Feb. 25, 1996, entitled "Employment and Survival in Urban America." He sought and received an endorsement from the DSA.    According to DSA documents, the New Party worked with ACORN to promote its candidates. ACORN, convicted in massive, nationwide voter fraud cases, has been a point of controversy for Obama over the presidential candidate's ties to the group.    In 1995, the DSA's New Ground newsletter stated, "In Chicago, the New Party's biggest asset and biggest liability is ACORN.    "Like most organizations, ACORN is a mixed bag. On one hand, in Chicago, ACORN is a group that attempts to organize some of the most depressed communit|`|R3E8DkTfaa	This can be answered with one example.  Obama by his own admission wants to redistribute wealth in this country.  He wants to take wealth from those who have more by way of taxes, and give it to those who have less in the form of a tax credit resulting in a check.  This is by its very definition a socialist tenant.      " From each according to his ability; too each according to his needs"  Karl Marx.    I want to also address another answerers statement that Obama is not a legitmate  presidential candidate based on a law suite which alleges he was born in Kenya.  While  I personally don't like Obama, this is a wrong premise.  Even if it is true that he was born in Kenya, the fact that his mother was an American Citizen automatically gives him citizenship.

"It is time the United States makes it a priority of our foreign policy to meet this goal and help those who are struggling day to day," a statement issued by supporters, including Obama, said.

gxzoa2raaa	There is a lot of emotion surrounding this question Frank, but let's look at the facts.   If some down and out, or a member or members of a destitute family are injured, sick or malnourished to the point they are unlikely to survive without help, then let them go. They are no use to themselves or to anyone else and certainly no use to our great country (America). They can be replaced by healthy immigrants in the blink of an eye. If they can be saved and put to work in the mines or picking cotton, great, that will be good for them and good for the economy and they can easily pay back their medical bills through enhanced tax assessment throughout the rest of their lives.  America is not a socialist country where everyone is expected to help take responsibility for those less well off citizens. Any red-blooded American atheist or agnostic, and the majority of American Christians, will tell you that. This kind of pointless socialism is one reason our economy is in the crapper.  The biblical prophets may have advocated otherwise but they were living during stable economic times so their view doesn't count. Things are different now, humanity has grown up a little and we have become more realistic.  Also, if you or your surviving family can't pay for a proper funeral the law should insist the deceased's protein and organs be usefully recycled. It has to come soon, so lets have a few dry runs with dead indigents whose family's protests, if any, are certain to fall on deaf ears.

It's simply a difference in thinking. Let me use an analogy of sorts:    Many believe it is compassionate to 'give a man a fish'. And it is. It helps that man live another day. Others, like me, believe that it is more compassionate to 'teach a man to fish' and then require him to fish...particularly given the fact that the man lives beside a lake teaming with fish. It is dependence versus independence. Dependence is compassionate because a person is taken care of. Independence is, in my opinion, more compassionate because the person is encouraged, sometimes strongly, to take care of themselves.     Who is more compassionate? The parent who supports their 35 year old child or the parent who prepares their child to support themselves and exercises a little tough love to encourage them to be independent?     If someone genuinely needs help, I have no problem with that.

6L7HFDSQaa	If this were actual voting poll results, yes it would matter greatly. These numbers however do not matter one iota right now because these are not actual "Voting results".   These votes are taken by places like Gallop Poll and AOL and CNN and PBS.   To explain...  Any time someone calls your home for a poll survey, this is counted in these "estimated polls" as I call them.  Any time you take a survey online this is counted in these "estimated polls".  The problem with this, is many people are surveyed many times. For instance, if you receive a phone poll and decide to accept, your name is then put on a list where you may be contacted by email to do another poll (If you give the same answers, that is counted as 2 votes). If you are like the majority of Americans, no one has ever called you for your opinion.  The second problem is that polls like AOL and CNN and PBS allow the same people to vote as many times as they like under the guise that they do not want to invade privacy and place a cookie on a voter's computer.  The third problem arises when a poll is actually trying to get the most honest results and require cookies on your computer.... most people know that all you have to do is clean your cookies and you can vote again. In other words, Polls may try but anyone who wants to inflate their party's numbers can do so.  I don't know about you but I have never once been contacted to take a poll by phone and neither have any of my friends. Obviously a lot of people have been. Unfortunately, those who have are a small number compared to the entire United States.  The last problem with these polls are that they are OPNION polls, not actual voter result polls. People do lie.  So do these polls matter? Not at all in my book.  NOT ONE number you see on these polls are actual votes.  They are "projected votes".  NOT ONE actual real vote can be disclosed until after all polls have closed on Novemebr 5th.  This is the bradley Effect.  I know no one will have read this long explanation and that's sad. This is how so many people vote. No time for details. No time for explanation. Just tell me if my ideal candidate is winning.  |`|TlBJT2hraa	By not voting you are giving  points to the opponent - make sure you vote McCain or you will be partly to blame for the Muslim take over of the world.|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	Polls don't mean squat.

So the distribution of votes among states is how the electoral college is selected. It is possible to win a majority of popular votes and lose based on the electoral votes. That's what happened in Gore vs Bush, where Gore was ahead by five hundred thousand popular votes more than Bush, but Bush won on the basis of electoral votes. However in any case the election was stolen from Gore due to fraud on Bush's part. In addition the notion of an electoral college is both unjust and antiquated.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	You aren't going to win the electoral vote if the difference in popular vote is greater then 4%.

I hope that doesn't stop you from pursuing your dream.|`|LgKYrup2aa	Well lets follow your logic;    So someone already earning say 300,000 has the opportunity to earn another $100,000 which under Bush they'd pay $36,000 tax and under Obama they'd pay $39,000    So are you really saying that someone is motivated to earn $64000 under Bush BUT because they'd only earn $61000 under Obama - they'd be de-motivated (and that they'd scale back so they don't have to pay the extra $3000) ???

Obama is like little league; everybody plays.    McCain is like club sports;  you earn your spot.    Club sports are growing in this country and little league is shrinking.  How's that for a snapshot of our country?  My daughter gave up little league 4 years ago and went to club volleyball.  Best decision she ever made!|`|gTpOTYFvaa	you honestly don't believe he'll take half your money, do you?    seriously?     you republican righties will believe ANYTHING your GOP tells you, right?  if they told you Obama was really from Mars, would you buy into that?    "spreading the wealth" doesn't breed mediocrity.  it does the opposite.  right now, plenty of us are working jobs where we're paid far too little to do hard work, sometimes even mindless work.  and we're at the mercy of these oh so patriotic corporations that, at the drop of a hat (or the raise of a tax) would leave us high (or low) and dry simply to hire cheaper labor in India or where ever.   so, encouraging that those that make the most pay the most is comforting to poor, hard-working people like me.  it makes me think that we the people aren't doing all the work and getting none of the pay (which is essentially what these CEOs hired by nepotism are doing... check out the AIG bossman for example).    small business owners are ALREADY scaling back because of these failed "trickle down" economics.    i don't get this whole Patriotic mess.  we claim that capitalism is patriotic, but what does it say about us when a business would fire an employee simply to increase their profit by a small amount?  isn't that being unpatriotic?  and isn't that the whole Republican agenda-  that the Left isn't Patriotic?    why must we have it either this way or that way?  we're either a cut-throat nation of capitalists, hell-bent on dropping bombs on EVERY middle east country, or, we're Socialists that want to reward the lazy, cowering at every possible threat from our "enemies"?    wake up, folks.  things aren't as simple as you believe them to be.    and, either way, they'll get their money.  you decide who it goes to.  government programs (like welfare, education, defense), or Big Oil-type CEOs of companies that are going bankrupt (even though their high brass are making millions per year).    think about it.|`|Naz6gmjOaa	You answered your own question.  You will pay more if you make more.  Which means, if you have a small business, that you cannot hire or give raises, and big businesses continue to ship themselves oversees because business is cheaper.  So I don't really know how your first respondent thinks that Obama's plan is going to make you money.  The only way that really works is if you sit on your @ss at home and collect welfare.  |`|HR5ijQLIaa	There will be no motivation to work hard or succeed, mediocrity will be the theme of the day.|`|cb55c53480fb7b57fae8733bf5e62f5daa	The flip side is how will it motivate the lower end, who will receive a check for not working, this will not have them looking for a job, if Obama is going to take care of them without a job  besides if you look at the latest census in 2006 the top 5% of earners start at $167,000, only 2.5% of the top earners make $250,000 and up, I think it's going to be hard for 2 1/2%of earners  to pay for all of Obama's programs, but another thing to consider is he going to give celebrities a Special tax break like Oprah, Spears and all the sports figures , will Hollywood move oversea to make their movies to escape the heavy tax burden|`|EKmXACCIaa	You should stick your head out of the box and have a look at the rest of the western world for a moment to get your answer? I despair for the histrionic bleating from Republicans about concepts they really just don't get.    The European Union runs social welfare programmes that are far more comprehensive and expensive than anything the Democrats have suggested putting on the table. Yet somehow as an average, EU citizens are healthier, live longer, has lower crime, hosts many of the world's largest businesses and in some areas of Scientific R&D have overtaken the US.     It's not always smooth running, but it's definitely not mediocrity! |`|U2BtL6KUaa	Everyone else has pretty much hit the nail on the head -- your math sucks. What you're implying is that someone making $250,000 will somehow take home less than someone who makes $250,001 under Obama's plan.    What you have failed to realize is that the tax bracket is tiered, meaning that someone who makes more money doesn't pay higher taxes on each and every dollar they made. Someone making $100k per year pays the same amount of taxes on the first $10k as someone who made only $10k for the year. The person who makes $100k will obviously be paying more taxes overall, however they would in no way take home less than someone who made less money to begin with.    I also have a problem with the McCain supporters in this thread who categorize the lower and middle class as "lazy *** bums" that "don't work" and "sit on a couch all day." Are you guys really that delusional? Only a couple percent of American citizens are NOT lower and middle class, yet you guys are saying Obama's tax plan is intended to pay lazy *** people that do no work. You do nothing to further the Republican cause when you accuse 97% of your fellow citizens of doing nothing for the country, so how about you quit making such ludicrous statements and stick to the facts.|`|uBqYq4CMaa	I don't think you are capable of making more than that, as exemplified by your lack of understanding on this issue.    Absolutely no one who is near that range would consider that a serious statement.  It  will merely put those people back in the tax bracket they were before the Bush cuts, and people weren't afraid of success then.|`|tkX8VMDSaa	It is more than doubtful that you would ever earn more than  $ 250.000.00.

(The Republicans Like Supply Theory its supposed to "trickle down" to us.)      A Company making over $250,000 has their taxes raised by 3%. SO they raise prices slightly to compensate. The tax breaks go to the Consumer, like me. I will be getting back an extra $988 under Obama's tax plan. Now I can by more. So I buy more from the company as does everyone else because we have extra money. So it increases sales for the company and they make more profit, offsetting the 3% tax increase. Now they are so busy they hire more workers and those people are no longer drawing unemployment and actually are tax paying citizens again. that is the basic Premice of Democratic economics Theory.    It does work. After the last Stimulus Check, the next quarter our Economic Growth rose to 3.3% the best in two years.|`|V2hIqNd9aa	raising your tax burden by 3% is not half.

Right now the additional % may seem small for them that make so much more that we do, but who's to say that, having been arbitrarily determined once, it can't be increased for that income level or that the income level to 'qualify' for additional 'contributions' won't be lowered to $180 k, or a tiered approach for additional taxes starting for them that make 6 figures and increasing every $30 k?  All in the name of 'fairness'?  Fair to whom?

It's our job as citizens to try to inform people of the truth, so that they will not be swayed by such propaganda, but it's difficult. Many of the people who answered this said "No, because they are telling the truth," when it takes about fifteen seconds of Googling to find out just how patently false all of the Christian Right's claims are.

AA12341057	It sounds like whoever questioned your faith isn't terribly strong in their own, or they'd know that Jesus was not a Republican.    I'd suggest just letting that roll off, because letting yourself get upset by ignorance will only make you angry all the time.    EDIT: See? Look at all the ignorance posted in response to your question here! People honestly think Jesus said something about Abortion.     Christians, feel free to have your own opinion and stand by it, but please don't shove it into Jesus' mouth. It's hard enough to live a good christian life by the rules that are actually in the bible- if you keep inventing new ways to send people to hell, no one will ever make it to heaven.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	Seriously..   check out mind control on wikipedia (not that there are not tons of other sites).   The use of "exclusion" or "he's not like US" is classic brainwashing methods.           Main article: Thought Reform (book)    In his 1961 book Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism: A Study of "Brainwashing" in China, psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, M.D., describes eight coercive methods which, he says, are able to change the minds of individuals without their knowledge and were used with this purpose on prisoners of war in Korea and China. These include:[1]        * Milieu Control. This involves the control of information and communication both within the environment and, ultimately, within the individual, resulting in a significant degree of isolation from society at large.      * Mystical Manipulation. There is manipulation of experiences that appear spontaneous but in fact were planned and orchestrated by the group or its leaders in order to demonstrate divine authority or spiritual advancement or some special gift or talent that will then allow the leader to reinterpret events, scripture, and experiences as he or she wishes.      * Demand for Purity. The world is viewed as black and white and the members are constantly exhorted to conform to the ideology of the group and strive for perfection. The induction of guilt and/or shame is a powerful control device used here.      * Confession. Sins, as defined by the group, are to be confessed either to a personal monitor or publicly to the group. There is no confidentiality; members' "sins," "attitudes," and "faults" are discussed and exploited by the leaders.      * Sacred Science. The group's doctrine or ideology is considered to be the ultimate Truth, beyond all questioning or dispute. Truth is not to be found outside the group. The leader, as the spokesperson for God or for all humanity, is likewise above criticism.      * Loading the Language. The group interprets or uses words and phrases in new ways so that often the outside world does not understand. This jargon consists of thought-terminating clichs, which serve to alter members' thought processes to conform to the group's way of thinking.      * Doctrine over person. Member's personal experiences are subordinated to the sacred science and any contrary experiences must be denied or reinterpreted to fit the ideology of the group.      * Dispensing of existence. The group has the prerogative to decide who has the right to exist and who does not. This is usually not literal but means that those in the outside world are not saved, unenlightened, unconscious and they must be converted to the group's ideology. If they do not join the group or are critical of the group, then they must be rejected by the members. Thus, the outside world loses all credibility. In conjunction, should any member leave the group, he or she must be rejected also.    In his 1999 book Destroying the world to save it: Aum Shinrikyo, Apocalyptic Violence and the New Global Terrorism, he concluded that thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion.    Robert W. Ford, a British radio operator who worked in Tibet in the 50's, spent 5 years in Chinese jails. He published a book entitled "Captured in Tibet", describing and analyzing thought reform to which he was harshly subjected.[2]|`|g4TWs4YUaa	Ignorance. pure and simple. I'm not sure how religious Obama is but I know he goes to church. I'm gonna take a quick look at McCain though. Correct me if I am wrong, but Jesus is kinda pro-peace? Meaning lets not "Bomb, bomb, bomb Iran". And I just want to throw this out here; "Church and State shall be keep separate". Even If Obama was atheist, or Muslim, it shouldn't really matter.

Ignore them. |`|7FVltZbkaa	People don't have the right to say that to you. People only say that because they think that we don't need an African-American president running our country. We need him to be our president. He is going to do all the right things for the next 4 years if he wins. McCain doesn't even have the respect to wear the American Flag pin on his suit. He says that he is not president Bush. Yeah, that's true. But, he did go for him OVER 90% of the time. So, that is a problem. Besides, if he wins and dies in office, then we automatically have a president that doesn't even know anything about our government. Besides, she is too dang worried about her 16 year old pregnant daughter. Everybody has their own opinion. If we just lived in a world that everyone HAS to think that we all have to think the same thing, then I would seriously kill myself. But, we don't. We live in a free country, and we can do whatever we want to EXCEPT kill people. So. don't worry about the other people. Trust me. I have people telling me, "Well. Why do you want Obama to be president. He is black, and we don't need a black president. He will turn us all into slaves." I just ignore them and go along with my opinion. So, just don't worry about. Okay. |`|pGf4mIw9aa	because people are ignorant, these are the same people who rooting for a woman who is spending the tax player money on her kids and a man who always seem to be called a liar but it's ok for them to be judgmental. these people are self center christians who pick and choose who they want to vote for and criticize you when you do not go with what they believe in so I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.

The use of obviously false registrations like Micky Mouse are not the way they do it.  Those are just the result of poor practices.      Acorn's intent is to register as many voters as possible (a good idea) but their practice is to register as many probable Democratic voters as possible.  They target certain neighborhoods and precincts that will yield vast majority of voters registering as Democrats.  They ignore areas that may tend to vote Republican. 
MtZZTDqhaa	Obama has NEVER advocated equalization of income or government ownership of industry - he is talking about proportional taxation! That is a FAIR and RESPONSIBLE implementation of how a country is funded in order to provide appropriate services and protection for its citizens.    This whole "socialist" smoke screen thrown up by the GOP is ridiculous. Socialism means that all businesses, banks and methods of production are owned & controlled by the government.     But wait a minute...I wonder what people would say if it was proposed that we took profits from businesses and redistributed them to the citizens?  That would seem to definitely be socialistic right?  Well that is exactly what happens in Alaska under Gov Palin.  The oil companies are owned by the government and a % of the profits are taken and given to the citizens.  Hmmm...how does that reconcile with her claims of Barack being a socialist???|`|2e41580c4f9ca26f64c21c7dcc27e33faa	obama's platform is fundamentally socialist insofar as his "spread the wealth" mentality.  His stated belief is that if you make more than another person, you should give the 'extra' that you make so that the other guy's income can be higher (i.e. if I make $35k each year and you make $45k, you should have to spread your wealth over to me so that we are equal)  That is a basic tenet of the socialist movement.  Personally, I want to keep the money I work for, and if someone else wants more money, they can go get a job, I shouldn't have to feel bad about being successful, and I shouldn't have to surrender part of my salary to someone else because they feel bad about not being able to afford the same things that I can.    EDIT:  My basic point is that entitlement programs, which are typically conceived by a liberal movement or arm of govt will perpetuate the spread the wealth platform that YES,OBAMA HAS HIMSELF SAID--"SPREAD THE WEALTH IS DIRECT QUOTE FORM THIS WHOLE JOE THE PLUMBER THING.  obama said to him "you're a plummer, you make enough, spread it around to others who don't" .  A scary stance for a politician to make because it DOES ECHO socialism.  ANd yes, the more money you make the more taxes you pay, but the ideology behind the current obama fever is that everyone should be on an equal financial playing field.  I object to THAT idea.  LIfe is not fair and I shudder to think what would happen if this government, be it rep or dem, try to make it so.  I'm not a fan og the govt being in my wallet with no spending limit.

There already are and there will continue to be. The questions are these. What level of socialism is acceptable? How effective are the programs? The first question revolves around the idea that there is a point where you inhibit people rather than elevate them. The second concerns the fact that government is notoriously ineffective and wasteful. Most people do not deny help to those in need, but there is difference between actual need and absolute laziness. There is no reason why I should have to pay more of income in taxes derived from my hard work to support those who can but will not do for themselves. Nor should any person be allowed to subsidize their lifestyle at the expense of others just because they believe they have a right where none exists, or something is too expensive. The only paths to success are education, hard work and determination. Socialism seeks to remove these restraints and falsely believes that people will just do these things naturally for the good of the collective. This goes against the most basic elements of human nature and this is why socialism fails as a prevailing concept. I did not address your question of abortion because these two things have nothing to with each other.|`|V2hIqNd9aa	Maybe because they are hypocrites?  Republicans like to hide behind 3 things.

As it stands now, woman can kill the baby by aborting the pregnancy.  The father can be charged with murder if he does, because the mother decided that it was life . . . he can also be tracked down and forced to pay for his "unwanted" child, again because the mother decided to keep it.  Deadbeat father laws have very socialist undertones.    If the decision is overturned, it falls back to the states, and the federal government is out of it.   In response to what you can se happening with the "unwanted" babies, I feel that abstinence may become the main form of birth control and will become more accepted.    Obama's plans seem to revolve around the middle class, me included, to depend upon the government far too much.  Re-distributing the wealth, universal health-care . . . all very socialistic ideals.    Granted, we as a nation already "have "social" agencies in our government that help people", but Obama seems to want to take them al ot further.|`|A3UftwH9aa	They are not truly "pro life" but actually anti-choice, not just regarding to reproductive rights of women but also to deny the people's choice in deciding which direction to take in regards to the betterment of all citizens by invoking their own narrow interpretation of Constitutional constructs.  Instead, this brood of reactionary laissez faire adherents want to force every citizen to be enslaved to the forces of market fundamentalism, where ultimately, the resources and means of production become concentrated within a powerful few entities whose only motive is for profit at the expense of others.  |`|MEReSvZeaa	Being pro life means that you think life is worth defending.

It does NOT take away a woman's right to choose. It takes away a State's Rights to choose how it governs. Abortion is an issue that should be left to the States - it is not a concern for the Federal Government.     Besides - what does this have to do with supporting socialism. Your stance on abortion can be completely separate from your views on economics.    Your definition of "socialism" is actually totalitarianism.|`|niD66AbCaa	Abortion is the question of life or death and the preservation of life. That has nothing to do with socialism. By your logic, you would consider any law to be socialistic in nature.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Actually if (and that's a big if) the decision was overturned the laws would revert back to the states.  In NY abortion was legal long before Roe v Wade and would remain so.  All Roe v Wade did was ignore the people..    As far as socialism goes, it may be stretch to call Obama one but he will be looking to increase government control on our lives.  When the government "gives" you something they can take it away..
bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	You're right, it doesn't really.  Assuming your family is healthy enough to even get private insurance that way.

I am sorry but $10K-$15K is a ridiculous amount to pay for health insurance.|`|PLgEgPv8aa	Using your own math, you'll actually get your healthcare for free and get $20 back in return at the end of the year.    Here's how it works:    Your healthcare costs through your husbands employer - $4980    McCain's tax credit - $5000    Assuming you will get a refund when you file your returns = free healthcare for your family and $20 to go see a good movie with your husband.  |`|2KlTGAPUaa	My son, a CPA explained this to me.    When you give a $5,000 tax credit to be used for health insurance to everyone, then the people who already have health insurance will benefit unfairly.    So to offset the $5,000 credit, people who have health insurance will have to claim the amount on their tax return.    But they will still be further ahead and this is why.    If you have a benefit for family of 4 of $12,000 and you are in a high tax bracket say of 30%, your tax is then $3,600.    Now add the $5,000 credit and you are actually AHEAD by $1,400.    So McCains plan will benefit you.    Even if an employer would no longer give health benefits to their employees, they would have to take that money and give the employees a raise instead.  No employees would ever stand for an Employer taking away a benefit without some other way of compensation.    So you could get a raise and go and buy your own health insurance with McCain's tax credit of $5,000 and you would be further ahead.    Either way it is a win-win to vote for McCain!!!      On 1/25/2007 vote on Senate Bill H.R. 2 , amdt 154 to amdt 100.   To improve access to affordable health care    Obama vote= NAY  McCain vote= YEA    Obama voted against improving healthcare.  McCain voted in favor of improving healthcare.    |`|WvYw2xvdaa	My husband & I together only cost us $1548 a year, that includes dental & life also, that is through our employer. So yes it would be be more than enough for us. If you have insurance through your husband's employer why are you looking for other insurance? So the credit would save you and your husband $5,000 a year, why is that so bad? Oh I get it, it does not cover the entire cost, you want the government to reimburse you for all of it. |`|o1PuFnWmaa	Well, given the amount I pay in to my employers health care program, it would do me just fine.  McCain's plan doesn't affect the employer benefits.  The employer would still get to take the tax credits they get for providing the health care benefit and you also make out because you can put the $5000 toward paying your share.  The government isn't supposed to PROVIDE healthcare.  The whole idea of McCain's is to help you afford coverage for it.    How many have actually READ McCains health care plan?  http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issu...  Try it sometime.|`|MJz9IUHqaa	Try Blue Cross or Texas, I currently pay $401 for my family.  If Obama's plan were to pass, working people, like your DH, would have to pay more taxes in order to pay for the non working people in addition to still paying for private insurance. Also the cost of private care will go up due to increased demand. Obama's plan is really a plagiarized version of the Canadian plan, in Canada the wait to see a specialist is 17.8 weeks. So the choice would be yours go with a public plan and wait 17.8 weeks for care or buy private insurance & not have to wait.   http://www.heartland.org/policybot/resul...|`|Tue5oCljaa	Yes, I am still waiting to find out how much Ms. Palins family could get a policy for if she had to buy one.  A $5000 dollar tax credit is a joke, especially after it finishes unraveling the whole employer/employee system.  If Sarah, found herself out of job like many Americans have, her family as she likes to put it, mirrors a lot of families...I don't think she's going to release her records though.  Just the basics it looks like it would be very high.    A credit would give you money back, on something you have already paid for.  So you better be able to afford it already to claim the credit.        |`|UavQy57Yaa	It doesn't,and please don't forget that John McCain intends to tax the insurance that your husband now has through his employer to pay for that $5000.00 insurance credit that he wants to give.       Note to WEM: Did you include the tax that will be added to her husbands insurace premium under McCains plan????? Time to re-calculate, oops on your part. So much for that money for the movie!|`|e23JUY4Daa	I think you have misunderstood the McCain proposal.  I'm not in favor of it personally, but let's be accurate about what the proposal is before we criticize.  You would not go out to buy a new policy if you have one through your husband's employer, you'd keep what you currently have.    The value of your current policy would then become taxable income, reported to you on the W2 form.  Are you paying the full value, or is your employer paying part?  Say for example your policy is valued at $10,000 and you are paying $5000.  If you are in the 15% tax bracket, your federal tax would increase by about $1500, but would be offset by the $5000 credit (it would be $2500 for a single person).  You would be about $3500 ahead on your federal taxes.  States just take the income figure from your federal form, so potentially your state income tax goes up maybe $500-800 or so, depending on what your state tax rate is, cutting into the credit a little more.  You would still come out ahead - at least the first year.  Those in higher tax brackets wouldn't come out as far ahead, and the $10,000 increase in your income could push you into a higher bracket.    The negatives on this are that:  A) It's predicted that employers will start getting out of the health insurance game altogether.  They will reason that since there's no longer a tax benefit, most people will be happier just getting cash instead of a policy.  This will look good to a lot of people at first.  The employer will say, "We're dropping your health plan, but will raise your salary by the amount we have been contributing toward it.  You'll come out even."  But then, after you're no longer in a group, you may have to pay more for a policy, or you'll be excluded for preexisting conditions.  Or your policy may go up by 6-8% a year and you get a 2% annual raise.      B)  Anything that is subsidized by the government tends to rise in price.  Health insurance companies are eager for this policy to be enacted because there will be an infusion of new cash from people who have been previously uninsured.  But they know they can raise prices because people can now afford to pay more; or if you want to keep the price down they may raise deductibles.  If there is no comprehensive reform, they will cherry-pick the healthiest and youngest purchasers.    I can't find any information on whether the $5000 goes up at all in future tax years.   My policy has gone up an average of 22% per year for the past six years.      Bottom line is, most people would be pleased with the policy in the near term.  But down the road five or ten years, something will need to be fixed again, unless the credit keeps growing to keep up with the increases in health insurance costs.|`|40iWDZohaa	Part of his plan also includes allowing sales across state lines, so you might shop policies in other states and get a better idea of what might be available.  The cost difference between NJ and CA is ginormous.    The idea is to promote individual health insurance plans, and to discourage group plans.The thinking is that when the consumer is paying the insurance premiums, (s)he will gravitate towards lower cost policies. Consumer Driven Health Plans (CDHP's) specifically. Having a CDHP allows you to open up a Health Savings Account (HSA) where you, and your employer, can contribute non taxable money for future medical expenses. With these plans everything is subject to the deductible, except your annual wellness benefit, which used to be called your annual physical. You are expected to pay for all of your medical services out of your own pocket (your HSA) until you reach your deductible.This will demand a more conscientious consumer, bringing market forces to bear. It might also bring some transparency to health care costs, lowering the costs for everyone. Another factor is that with an individual policy, you own the policy, not your employer. Cobra, and it's limitations, goes away with individual policies.    The argument against CDHP's that people won't save for future expenses, and will also simply forgo minor or maintenance types of care which may require more expensive treatment down the road.    I think both sides are right, and everyone agrees something has to change because what we have now isn't working. Something has to change.

Within a few days after 9/11, although, we have always had troops there.   4. We declared war (after 9/11) and we were supposed to go after Afghanistan, NOT Iraq.   5. 9/11 was the first attack.  6. No, this is not religious, it is now about oil.   7. No we have not. Read the news.   8. There will always be wars. They will always plan ways to attack us.  9. No, we should not fight for a free/bomb free America. What happens when we get attacked again? We have no defense.   10. I do not want to worry about it no. Who does.  11. No we should not sit and wait. We should keep our eyes open this time.   12. Death, war, attacks, all a cost for freedom.   13. It is yes, but not when the government takes it away from us. IE. Smoking bans in bars... Its not like we are going to bars to get healthy..  14. Absolutely Israel has every right to survive. We can not commit geneocide on a country that has every right to be around as anyone else.   15. Alright, these questions are becoming absurd. Absolutely not. We should not ever have another Holocaust on anyone.   16. A war is never one because of the cost of peoples lives that were involved. Ultimately, if the bad countries (Iraq, Iran and such) were a democracy, it would end the war.   17. We should only if it is necessary and with or without permission based on the information we have been given about the situation.   18. Should we stay in Iraq, no not really.   19. Absolutely, we should find Osama.   20. Yes, defending ourselves makes us a strong nation.   21. Anytime. Are you going to let someone smack you in the face and be ok with that?  22. Going to Iraq in the first place. We shouldn't have gone there.   23. No, the oil prices are going to go up and the economy gets worse and the oil supply deminishes.   24.

Many of these machines were ordered by Republicans I wonder why. The Republican watchers interfere  with the voting trying to challenge and intimidate people.

I have tried so hard not to sling mud as I have been called time and time again a racist for not voting Obama. I have tried to stick to the facts and not stoop to the level some people have stooped to.I have brushed it off as far leftists have called me every name in the book because I don't happen to agree with them. I have listened to the false allegations from both parties and I'm sick of the playground antics.   First and foremost, if you really want to bring religion into this, let's look at Jeremiah Wright whose exact words were; "Not God Bless America, but God DAMN America." Obama admitted throughout a large part of his campaign that he stood behind Wright until the heat almost cost him the campaign at which point, he denounced Wright (after swearing he never would), then he threw Wright under the bus.  Did he believe in Wright until voters said "That's bad"?  Would you seriously denounce the man that baptized your children and performed your wedding ceremony - a man that you said was "Like an Uncle to me", a man that you believed in and stood up for - would you really throw him under the bus for votes??? OBAMA DID!!  To me this shows a man who will sell his soul for a vote.  If you really want to know the truth... Sarah Palin is far more qualified than Obama will ever be. Here is why;    Question: What is America s first line of missile interceptor defense that protects the entire United States ?  Answer: 49th Missile Defense Battalion of Alaska National Guard.    Question: What is the ONLY National Guard unit on permanent active duty?  Answer: 49th Missile Defense Battalion of Alaska National Guard    Question: Who is the Commander in Chief of the 49th Missile Defense Battalion of Alaska National Guard?  Answer: Governor Sarah Palin, Alaska    Question: What U.S. governor is routinely briefed on highly classified military issues, homeland security, and counter terrorism?  Answer: Governor Sarah Palin, Alaska    Question: What U.S. governor has a higher classified security rating than either candidate of the Democrat Party?  Answer: Governor Sarah Palin, Alaska. According to the Washington Post, she first met with McCain in February, but nobody ever found out. This is a woman used to keeping secrets. She can be entrusted with our national security, because she already is.    You think I lie? Do you really want to know the truth? Look up "Palin 49th Battalion Alaska" on Google. Better yet, check it out with snopes.com.    I don't really care that some visitor visited her church years ago and she happened to greet them.     I care about the issues and all this mud slinging on both sides has made me more determined than ever to shut you all out and run to the Polls and vote for my choice NOW!

YPHi5ww2aa	Palins Town Used to Bill Victims for Rape Kits was headline on a Thursday USA Today news story. Reporters Ken Dilanian and Matt Kelley used a 2000 quote from former Wasilla Police Chief to blame Palin for an outdated, now illegal policy she never supported.|`|eulMjLtPaa	This DID happen in 2000, while she was in office.  The Governor of Alaska signed legislation "protecting victims of sexual assault from being billed" for those tests.    Her appointed police chief, Charlie Fannon, disagreed, saying that they needed the money for their hockey rink.  He said, "The forensic exam is just one part of the equation. I'd like to see the courts make these people pay restitution for these things," Fannon said, noting that he intended to include the cost of the exams in a restitution request as a part of a criminal's sentencing.    The tests cost anywhere from $300-$1200.      So it wasn't her specific actions that created this, but her agreement with her appointed police chief.  |`|11bc4cae873dd3e9feff6c81fac05c17aa	A mayor does not make City Ordinances, and cannot change them unilaterally.

I think Palin is completely unsuitable for high office, but if you make a specific claim like this you should really back it up.    Added details: the answer above mine gives a link. She didn't start the policy but she allowed it to continue.      This actually meant that women were paying for the examination that was providing evidence regarding the crime. The same as (and in the circumstances far worse than) billing you for police time if you reported a burglary.    It would be okay to try and get the money back from health insurance, but in the US (unlike every other advanced nation) health insurance is not universal.

I think that's how they do things in Alaska. |`|eMYOiim8aa	Sarah Palin eludes answering this question for fear of being put on the spot. This article gives a few sound bites.      In 2000, complaints about this practice in rural cities including Wasilla prompted the Alaska Legislature to pass a bill preventing alleged victims of sexual assault from being billed for forensic tests. It was signed into law by then-Gov. Tony Knowles. Palin had been the mayor of Wasilla for four years at the time, and a local paper reported that the Wasilla police chief, Charlie Fannon, defended the practice, saying he had billed women and their insurance companies for these tests rather than placing a "burden" on taxpayers:        Mat-Su Valley Frontiersman (May 23, 2000): "In the past we've charged the cost of exams to the victim's insurance company when possible. I just don't want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer," Fannon said.        According to Fannon, the new law will cost the Wasilla Police Department approximately $5,000 to $14,000 a year to collect evidence for sexual assault cases.    Palin wasn't quoted in any news coverage at the time. More recently, after she was picked to be Sen. John McCain's vice presidential running mate, her spokeswoman Maria Comella told USA Today that the governor "does not believe, nor has she ever believed, that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence-gathering test." Comella declined to answer questions about when Palin found out about the practice and what, if anything, she tried to do about it. Fannon, who is no longer the chief of police, has not spoken to the press either.    Eric Croft, a former Alaska state representative who sponsored the 2000 legislation, told CNN that "I find it hard to believe that for six months a small town, a police chief, would lead the fight against a statewide piece of legislation receiving unanimous support and the mayor not know about it." But Croft, a Democrat, says he does not recall discussing the issue with Palin at the time.    The bottom line,  While mayor of Wasilla, Palin didn't  want the cost of paying for them taken out of their budget.|`|vc8YZyxOaa	that's a false rumor. she never forced women to pay for rape kits.  |`|EY1KHLxBaa	She is not for women's rights.

She would make you feel about one foot tall.|`|iUzzXldLaa	This came out today she has time to respond but you know this has nothing to do with the US thats Australia.Quit being so desperate!|`|xo7Ea5fZaa	I can't speak for her or any other Americans but I am pretty sure you are an idiot.  She, like all Americans, is anti illegal immigrants.  It wouldn't matter the mental state of the immigrant.  On a personal note, a person that has full mental capacity, like yourself, should never be allowed to pollute our shores.   You should have yourself checked for that gene, and an auto abortion may be in order.|`|1uAduUKhaa	Palin doesn't get paid enough to think.....|`|QuNh2XEUaa	I have yet to see anything that says she is anti immigrant.  A lot of us are anti ILLEGAL ALIEN...but legal immigration we welcome!      Tht being said, I saw the story on this and I think it would be more interesting to see what Obama/Biden have to say about it.  The boy was denied residency because Australia has nationalized medicine and it was determined that he would be too much of drain on thier healthcare system.  How does national healthcare look now...you get wonderul free treatment...as long as you stay healthy, of course.  If we determine that you are a "drain" then you are on your own.|`|fh12fkNWaa	Of, course she'd express outrage. However, it wouldn't surprise me if we have the same immigration stand. We generally don't let people in who would be a drain on the system/our resources as opposed to someone who would work and contribute to it.|`|9eBruYtqaa	what are you talking about?

iVv6bFW2aa	Well, we can't take it for granted , remember Gore vs Bush. In any case even a blind person can see that Obama is ahead in the polls.|`|YIWKPXokaa	If Obama wins Florida, it's over for McCain.|`|2CdcUDxSaa	I wish these news stations would put away their electoral map projections. Don't they remember what happened in 2000?|`|tnagkORQaa	It is telling... but it can only hint at who may win.

wAiQOP0Laa	LOL, I thought you were kidding.  But you can't be mad at the guy for capitalizing on his 15 min of fame.  I applaud him for it.  That's the American way.|`|SdbL0b6Vaa	It's quite funny how quickly the "real Americans" of the heartland would sell out all the McCain-Palin conservative ideals to become media elitists in Hollywood.|`|0686e457a634ce1e335c836cdfa1f056aa	In the article his PR firm says "He can sing and obviously has a strong political point of view. But he didn't have the guts to say he's supported McCain all along. He's a clown in his 14th Minute and his time will be up next week.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	It can only be that in view of where the McCain campaign is going. Or it could be OY,or Gothic music performed by  Skinheads who are also supporting McCain . Take your pick.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	LOL  It'll probably be a country music CD, but that would be cool if he could play a mean blues guitar!
iVv6bFW2aa	For a number of reasons.The Anchorage Daily News and other papers endorsed Obama because they know who Sarah is, and they worry that she'll be a heartbeat away from the Presidency. I am sure they are afraid that Crazy Sarah and Crazy John may start some more wars. Other papers were turned off by the GOP 's smear campaign against Obama.any newspapers also expressed the fact that Obama is more level headed and serious.Fewer papers endorsed the GOP ticket, because there were hard core Republican of which very few are left. Obama peeled off the others.
23e71794644d88340d4a6d39fc2c1cb2aa	Don't forget "Joe - The- Hot-Head!"    Thats John McCains brother, who has been known to have a bad temper.|`|PVcdO65Oaa	Yes  McCain and everyone who support him remind me of some  Cartoon characters|`|HamL63Dtaa	Nopes|`|t0uTPIxJaa	I'd rather read a comic book than the communist manifesto.|`|bFAch2uQaa	As a Joe Six-Pack I can say that I am as real as you.    You are real, ain't ya?|`|b152183a660c2dbd3a470965bcb67686aa	McCain is big on gimmicks.    Like suspending his campaign to "work on the economic problem".

But in the Comic Sarah Palin is A bad guy, I think.|`|UgMPeGPvaa	yes and Obama and his thugs are the vilains|`|WUxdDs7yaa	That's excellent. McCain is desperate, and poor Joe the Plumber is getting in trouble now because of it.|`|azBErFyYaa	It does seem like they are trying to throw those things out so they seem personal, but its obvious that he is trying to seem like your average guy.  It doesn't seem natural.      I thought you were gonna say, does the McCain campaign seem like the comics section of the newspaper, a BAD JOKE?!    |`|84fd7e4798193628f44c8efd477cee2caa	yes,and now his brother Joe has called 911 to get the traffic to move faster,cussing and raising hell because they can't help him. says he is John's brother and they need to do something.|`|k3SW7Dixaa	Yes. Palin is definitely a cartoon villainess...scary looking and mean beyond belief!!!      And since she has only read the Classic Comics version of the Constitution it is a perfect analogy!!!|`|tmer08ZQaa	Then don't vote for him. I know I sure will.|`|u23sBafTaa	 Yeah this whole election is just one big joke! See how much your laughing if Obama and his dream team gets into office!|`|q1GnMRxxaa	And Obama is a horror film.

Obama    "the one" ,  Biden       "the babbler",   Ayres        "the domestic terrorist",  Axelrod     "the truth hider,   and Brezinsky "the war starter"    Sounds less like a comic book and more like a nightmare in the making.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, or something akin to Nightmare on Elm Street. Sometimes scary, some times, bizarre.All these Joes, and now the bad tempered brother John.The $15,000  dress and Sarah's witch cleansing ceremony. It would be funny if it wasn't so scary|`|U50orfPhaa	Better that than OBAMA similarities to HITLER Rallies!  Yes HITLER was very loved and a manipulator similar to Obama. We know how that turned out.
AA11904370	It's the Republican way - Saks, Neiman Marcus...  How could someone be so insensitive to everyone's financial woes and spend so much money on clothes to be worn just a few times.|`|niD66AbCaa	No. Obama spent $21 million on polling and you're whining about $150,000 in clothing??? BUT THAT is taking a bit of advice from your candidate and SPREADING THE WEALTH AROUND!!! |`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	It was her motto, but soon it will be "drop baby drop".....|`|zHQVlXd5aa	What is wrong with that?      What is so special about Macy's anyway?  It's not even as nice as Dillards.    I wore $200 shoes, an $80 shirt, and $20 underwear (yes I had pants, but they weren't expensive) today.  Should I not do that?|`|RuUUPWYUaa	Indeed Palin's new motto should be "Shop Baby Shop". That's right project the image of WalMart and Target; yet get preferred treatment at Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus. Then to further insult the intelligent of the American people; tell them of stories of "Joe the Plumber, who isn't really a plumber. |`|4zoFPN1eaa	$150,000 and Palin still looks like a dowdy old toad.

Here is a great link that shows Obama's shoes for all those that think that Obama spends a pretty penny on his clothes.  And, Obama pays for his clothes not the DNC.  The RNC paid for Palins.      http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2008/1...|`|G9x3x8R2aa	Doing her part in keeping the economy going.  Are you jealous?

You don't think that Obama pays a pretty penny for his suits? I am sure he is not going to Macy's and pulling them off the rack. I am sure they are tailor made for his body. I would not be surprised if there were a few Armani suits in his wardrobe.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes    It should be "Shop, baby, Shop and shop 'till you drop"|`|AA11193401	Its no money out of your pocket|`|I6dcRgD6aa	everytime I think of spending that much money on her & her still acting like an ignorant dog gone non-professional I think of the saying Lipstick on a Pig.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	If it's not it should be. She should follow her master, Bush , who said the very same thing when he sent out his stimulus checks.Drill Baby Drill doesn't sound too original anymore|`|3uH441n3aa	She's just spreading the wealth like Osama wants.
5haELxU5aa	It just shows where their priorities are and, once again, how hypocritical they are. And Mrs. "I'm just a regular gal, like y'all" Palin show that she is ready to go all "Wurshington" on the American people, despite her claims otherwise. Yeah, she really knows how the regular Americans live!     Oh and that "I sold the plane on Ebay" lie, also involves some additional deception. (See link beloe.)    I'm not mad about it though, I think it's great every time they forget to cover up their true colors, and they ain't red, white, and blue!|`|I6dcRgD6aa	anyone who would give them their vote deserves to get ripped off. I don't pay attention to Palin & the clothes look too good on her. You can't put lipstick on a Pig & not expected it to say Oink, Oink, don gone it.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	No, I give the money and trust they know what to do with it.    Are you upset about Michelle Obama's $600 Champange and lobster lunch? ... Or the $23 million Obama's spent on polling?    |`|3uH441n3aa	Why don't you try a different subject for a change.You must be jealous of her looks.|`|0j9Ggisxaa	Not at all..   Im more upset about Obamas growing length of his campaign ads that are littering the airwaves..Talk about wasteful spending!!|`|7ce892cc4050e10ec9ceecb9421c3efdaa	No not at all.  The RNC can do whatever they want with their money.  They plan to donate all of the clothes to charitable organizations.  |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Very, I think its obscene in the face of such hunger, poverty and the meltdown, which was the fault of Bush. Cindy McCain could have lent her some of her old dresses, but perhaps she is jealous and angry at Sarah. I'll bet some of the money came from Federal funds, knowing how greedy and corrupt Bush is. However despite the clothes, she still looked pretty ugly. I guess you can't make a silk purse out of a lipsticked saw.|`|xZy05taKaa	Obama has made it very unpopular to have any money  So they had better can those Gucci bags and Channel sunglasses, and forget BeBe shoes or Juicy anything. After all if one wants the tax payers handouts these things are unacceptable.  And so is the MAC and the Ipod..... can't have those when on government assistance, that kind of stuff only comes with capitalism.  Also no new foreign cars.. Completely OUT! Just buy used american and pay for it up front, no fancy loans for cars you cannot afford.....   Besides Obama said:  We cant drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times  and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK, Obama said.    Thats not leadership. Thats not going to happen, he added.    Well I bet Biden's suits were a lot more for all his appearances so you may want to re think that issue  |`|51xtLyFBaa	I am not upset as I donate to the Obama/Biden Campaign.  However, this is a good indication of how he would spend your tax money if he were president.|`|TQo4pGJiaa	I'm more upset about Obama's campaign donation to the gay, lesbian, transgender, and other weirdos for the purchasing of sexual stimulants.  disgusting.|`|G9x3x8R2aa	Why are you stuck on this non-issue?  Get over it.  Cant you find something of substance to complain about, like the issues I gave you in your last post.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Why? Have you ever wondered how much Obama has spent on designer suits in the 2 years he has been running?     What pisses me off is that Obama is the one running the dirty campaign through the media for free! Where do you think the media got that information? |`|kB7Wuyknaa	I am.  It's ridiculous!  Why in the world does she need such expensive clothing and why does the american people have to pay for them?  On another note, add cindy into that and it really shows how down to earth they are doesn't it?|`|XvovBRlnaa	They should be ashamed.|`|z6OePRCMaa	Without actual names attached, I assume these MSM stories, sourcing "irate donors" or a "big contributor"  are made up by the writer -- since there is no way to challenge them on it.  Typical media trick.|`|d7klV6nmaa	And to top it off she won't wear these clothes again...I would have been thrilled to hear, "Well, now she's all set for the next 4 years (if we are able to eek out another one)!"|`|UiGm48Kgaa	Alot of wierdos....and their answers lol. this is a retard zone 
c24282040d7da6cf349fea698367f227aa	She should have shopped at Target.....|`|4f5ff0e7b7304267a5075a39531e4ea4aa	  What a waste of money she spent another 25.000 to tote her family around I wonder is her hubby incapable of taking care of the kids, but what really makes me laugh is four times she had been asked what the roll of the Vice President is four times  and she got it wrong every time how stupid is that, She even gives beauty contestants a bad name.         I want to know what charity are they going to give them to do you think salvation army hmmmmm, no some beverly hills consignment store |`|iVv6bFW2aa	She's cheap enough to sell the clothes on e bay, as she did with the airplane. Then she'll keep the money and have Bush not make her pay income taxes.She wouldn't donate anything, because she's a rip off, billing the State for her children's travel.|`|A0825FVZaa	Yes I heard that she will donate them after the election. It is really sad that sarah Palin gets criticized no matter what she does. If she wore cheap clothes , the media would call her white trash. She just can't win.|`|VNZFwdEkaa	maybe she will give them back to the GOP so they could share them with Michelle Bachmann. since it looks like Bachmann is in serious need of help!|`|UvzKiis0aa	Well, she will probably figure out a way to keep them without paying taxes.  She is your typical corrupt GOP shill.  The contractors she gave a Wasilla contract built her house for free.  She charges Alaska for time spent in her own house and for transporting her children around the state so why wouldn't she just take the clothes and figure out a loophole?    Yeah, it's like that!|`|A5J4Exc1aa	Palin will wear them to Congress and also the White House.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	It doesn't matter. Either way they're income to her.     Even if she donates them to charity, they are used clothing and worth almost nothing in resale value. So they can't really say that she was just borrowing the clothes.    There's a bigger issue here, which says that if they are income, who is responsible for paying the taxes? Is she responsible, as an independent contractor, or is she acting as an employee of the RNC? If she is an employee, they should be withholding 50% of the taxes and she should be paying the rest herself. Since she is completely programmed in this campaign, rather than making her own decisions about when and where to work, that would mean that if the RNC does not withhold taxes for her, they will end up paying all the taxes themselves as a penalty.|`|51xtLyFBaa	Actually, she has to return them to the RNC which is going to donate them to charity.|`|pEV8cuZyaa	Her shameless and thoughtless display of decadence in time of economic crisis is utterly despicable.    Nothing wrong if she's a private person, but she is running for the second highest office in the land, talking about God and acting so sympathetic of the poor (which is bad acting actually, she should have sought Tina Fey's help for acting tips).      
LK3GOgS5aa	Unchecked they will bring down our Country|`|YIWKPXokaa	No    That would be Republicans that are terrorists.|`|3a082722cea27ba378a88a859b07202daa	Get off the mind altering stuff. You can still have an opinion and be a great American. Now that Obama has received the most money or should I say votes from people who still can donate big money it is time to make changes and get along. From what I can remember democrats  have done some very good things but when they get close to doing something great democrats can not find safety from right radicals. I have voted republican for twenty years and have not seen my life get real good, it just stays the same. I am ready for a change now.|`|kIE9TxvWaa	I guess I am a terrorist.      BOO!!  Sorry it's halloween.  lol hehe :)|`|JxYLnTGiaa	George Bush is a terrorist.    And that's a fact. |`|3tNTOtc4aa	End the Cuban embargo!  Hasta la victoria siempre!

What, I do fear is that the US is becoming a Police state, with its citizens losing their Rights to Bush's war on terrorism.|`|7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	Peaceful people as myself choose HOPE!!|`|f6Qad0usaa	Fear is rooted in positive instinctive behavior for human survival.  Hope is the realm of the inactive and passive victim.    Everybody gets scared...it is what you do in response to that fear that defines who we are in life.|`|bEynoNf6aa	It depends upon the current situation in the nation the election being run in.  In a content society with a good economy and few threats, fear works best.  In a society that has real clear and present dangers, hope works better.
kJM65nXJaa	Is that you Sen. McCain? Seriously she is a real liability. Again goes to judgment.|`|s68u1i5Yaa	who cares|`|a2rjzPYZaa	No. Obama couldn't carry her jock strap.|`|vBnlfBfOaa	she is te right woman for te job|`|Hw8rr1TCaa	Yes.

Unlike Obama or Biden she has a very impressive resume of actual accomplishments.  If she wasn't an asset the main stream media whores (Cnn, Msnbc, SNL etc) would not be trying day in and day out to slander and misrepresent her.  It's shameful.      I can't wait to vote for her.|`|QI2OxkImaa	Yes a liablity along with his policies.|`|0jyj1sqkaa	she is a woman dummy|`|qpYOEi7Oaa	yep she most certainly is the right woman for the job....  |`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	I dont' know ask her to lift up that skirt. I've often wondered.|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	No, she isn't.  I understand the need libs have to attack Palin given that they can't trumpet anything Biden has done.
6f0e45a91719820a0d453b3ba6acce13aa	He can't!  But let us imagine for a moment that he does...always, what happens? The STATE you live in suddenly increases your tax!  One hand gives, the other picks your pocket.|`|AA11008868	I do!  |`|GsVZlD1faa	HEAR ME?  I believe Obama will cut the taxes of 95% of US citizens taxes.  American are Canadians Central Americans and South Americans. Obama can't cut their taxes.  McCain might Central America's he was born there after all.|`|eD1ODTeSaa	I think you have to look at the tax plan carefully.  The Bush era had some significant tax relief with stimulus checks being sent regularly. If Obama wins, the Bush tax reliefs are being removed.  A new tax plan will be put in place.  So, if you take tax relief away, then add your own plan, you start over and give tax relief to all Americans.  It is a play on words.|`|AA11179568	I BELIEVE|`|hirZcanfaa	I know my taxes will be cut. And that's all that really matters to me. |`|72OuVcA8aa	It starts out like this.  Obama institutes the 250000 limit for taxing people/small businesses.  Small businesses suffer profit losses because of the increased taxes and thus cannot hire workers, must lay off workers, or close down completely leading to fewer jobs.  Because of the fewer jobs, more people will rely on government and the funds will not be there so he will then lower that limit in increments until everyone is taxed to pay for what he really wants in the first place...a socialist nation where all people are dependent on government for everything and the American dream is dead.  This, my friend, is the way the man will destroy this country.|`|86ukTrs1aa	I don't think he will cut taxes of 95%. If he cuts taxes for at least 80%, that would still be an accomplishment. I think the latter would be more realistic.  |`|FmmidRHVaa	40% of the 95% are on welfare,but guess what.  Increase in sales tax  More tax on retirements  more gas tax  more Death Tax  more inheritance tax   etc.  If it walks tax it!  We have got to keep that 40% Happy!    |`|ED433Q6Yaa	hard to belive since 45% of americans do naot pay taxes at the end of the day and his plan will give them an extra 4000 cash at income tax time. how will he pay for that? and how will he pay for all his programs. mark my words and gird your loins, hw will raise taxes on eveyone with two years if elected. clinto did it, bush sr. did it. |`|xZy05taKaa	Anyone who does knows nothing about Politics, history or the economy|`|AA10576174	LOL........sadly people honestly believe it.  We could be bankrupt as a nation and they would still believe he would find the money someplace else other than taxes to  operate on......"He is only going to tax the rich" is their statement........I just wish they could be honest with themselves at least and know its gonna be everybody having taxes raised.|`|M56HmmkBaa	    That is nothing more then telling the people what they want to hear.... not what they need to hear..|`|humqqiLtaa	Oh, i'm sure he will. Oh, but wait, how can we have universal health care, if we don't have money to fund it, and how can we have rebates on buying more efficient cars, if there's no money, and most importantly, how can he promise anything, if he doesn't have the money to fund any of it?!

So he uses this tricky catch phrase when he really means "income redistribution".    Obama plans to give a tax cut (or credit) to people who do not pay income tax at all -  which means there are people who will not pay anything in to the system, but will get a rebate check anyway.    Can you say "socialism"?    Read this article from the Wall Street Journal - it's explains quite a bit about Obama's "95% Illusion"...    "One of Barack Obama's most potent campaign claims is that he'll cut taxes for no less than 95% of "working families."     It's a clever pitch, because it lets him pose as a middle-class tax cutter while disguising that he's also proposing one of the largest tax increases ever on the other 5%.     But how does he conjure this miracle, especially since more than a third of all Americans already pay no income taxes at all?     There are several sleights of hand, but the most creative is to redefine the meaning of "tax cut."    Here's the political catch. All but the clean car credit would be "refundable," which is Washington-speak for the fact that you can receive these checks even if you have no income-tax liability. In other words, they are an income transfer -- a federal check -- from taxpayers to nontaxpayers. Once upon a time we called this "welfare," or in George McGovern's 1972 campaign a "Demogrant." Mr. Obama's genius is to call it a tax cut."    The Tax Foundation estimates that under the Obama plan 63 million Americans, or 44% of all tax filers, would have no income tax liability and most of those would get a check from the IRS each year.

BIQrsl4paa	Here we go again, more conservative bashing by liberals. Why is it that what newspaper Gov. Palin reads is more important than the fact that Michelle Obama stated the she has never, in her adult life, been proud to be an american until her hubby decided to run for pres? It seems to me that the liberal media has a field day jumping on anything a conservative says or does, but sees no reason to ever mention any of the things their fellow libs say and do. |`|AA11166769	No, it wasn't.

She didn't ask ridiculous nonsense questions when she interviewed Biden. I use to like her, I cant stand the liberal now.    Who want to read newspapers today, they are all full of liberal garbage anyways!|`|eMYOiim8aa	It was a perfectly reasonable question.  Why she was not specific in her answer is anyone's guess. If Sarah Palin was offended and thought it unfair to be asked that question it shows she is out of character. All Sarah had to do was name a couple of newspaper such as Alaska's  Daily News, USA Today, The Wall Street Journal...then by stating she was not limited to reading just those but read international news reports would have sufficiently answered the question. This would show how in touch she is with the news on a local, national and international level.  In these interviews Sarah has shown her evasiveness and leaves her audience uninformed as to what she stands for.   |`|VYtW0uRiaa	I watched that interview and i can say without a doubt Couric was a hateful interviewer.No wonder she gets past from show to show as no one can stand to work with her. her little short fat self needs to realize she is not that important.|`|OPbJvB8Zaa	who cares what newspaper she reads or don't read?

Almost as ridiculous as Sarah Palin herself.  |`|0sBkAFqSaa	Yes.  Here history is being made and one would think that Couric would ask questions pertaining to so many other pressing issues, but instead she chose to asked a question that one would believe could be considered demeaning.

Haven't you seen how the super-rich paying hardly any taxes has inspired them to create gazillions of high-paying jobs, with full bennies?    Oh, you live in the REAL world, do you?    Why do people accept this? I think it's partly becuase they listen to people who keep telling them that rich people already pay too much in tax. It's also because many of them hope to be super-rich themselves one day.    They also believe McCain when he keeps saying that Obama is raising THEIR taxes.    And, they buy into the lie that the money those people get is THEIRS (rather than profit from everyone else's labor, the labor of all their employees, who they refuse to pay a living wage).|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	Corporations take from the poor and middle class every single day and give tot he rich.

But in that fringe they're still convinced they're right and justified, they still oppose Obama with the same hostility they did before the results were in. The show in the link is just an example of the kind of thinking there. Maybe they'll finally cut themselves out of the mainstream at last.

They can take the saner elements of the party with Ron Paul and leave the God and Guns crowd to wallow in their hatred. We should all just give up on owning the South electorally. As long as we still outnumber them in the rest of the country they will never be able to dictate the national agenda again.    If they want to secede, let them!! LMAO!! They can have their members of the Supreme Court to start off with!! And their anti'gay, anti-abortion, anti-dinosaur agenda can have free reign.    i think it would be compassionate to offer refugees from the South safe haven in the more civilized parts of the nation. Resettlement assitance. And de-programming if they ask for it!!! LMFAO!!    But seriously......Ron Paul was not my favorite politician for a long time. His right wing, economic rationalist views are far from compatible with my own. But many good Americans share these views and it is a tragedy that they are left floundering for the want of some integrity within the GOP leadership and the candidites they stand for high office..    I would warrant that a large number of these people pencilled Ron Paul in as President in states where that was possible. I know a few who, through disgust at the whole tenor of the Republican campaign, had no intention of voting for Mc Pain.....and I doubt that too many of them swung to Obama!   LOL! His tax plan is not exactly simpatico with their basic beliefs on the economy.      There would be debate and discourse again with the Cons under Ron Paul. With a team chosen by Paul to oppose us, there would be a real attempt at a bi-partisan solution to Iraq. there would be some honor on the other side of the house.There would be an end to this ludicrous situation where the finance sector is allowed to ruin the economy...and then get public money to bail THEM out...and leave the rest of us impoverished. No money for schools, no money for infrastructure, no money at all!!    And the opposition would again have some some intellect too. Which would be a lovely change in and of itself. LOL!!

However, in all likelihood our government will underperform yet again, causing the people to turn to Republicans to inject some sensibility into Washington again.

The world does, after all, owe everyone Yahoo points and the playing field is not level therefore we must tax all to bring point levels to a reasonable average.  I propose a progressive point tax with all who have points in the range of 1200 to 1500 be charged 18%, 1501 to 1801, 18.1% up to all in posession of over 35,000 points with  a .1% increase each 300 point level.  After one owns 35,000 points, then he becomes subject to the alternative minimum point tax which is a completely different set of progressive taxes.  Except for myself, of course.  I thunk it up, so I don't have to pay.  |`|ia2kz4qyaa	no, for example user A give out more answers to earn points  user B is new and don't give out answers,so y!a give points to user B  and it's not fair to user A. |`|sOpIMeJSaa	your question is politically contrived and since politics is disgusting to me, i make no comments, but i like the way you think. good mind.|`|qAUcN7GXaa	lol|`|zJEmWHKVaa	no! i like your style! lol!|`|wNcTEADJaa	hehehe, thats a good one :)|`|AA10174275	Yahoo isnt life.

Also, I went to really great schools that gave me the abilities to make these points.  However, a lot of people weren't provided with these same gifts/opportunities that I was.

zvjMQo0Haa	this is the e-mail I received about it......    What if the Los Angeles Times had video of John McCain toasting a known  Islamic terrorist?  What would the reaction be if the Los Angeles Times  told everyone it had the tape, but refused the release the tape?  And  what if credible people who had seen the tape reported that other  terrorists were in the room?    This is not a hypothetical.  This is actually happening.  Only it  involves Barack Obama.  And the Los Angeles Times has admitted it has  the tape.    In 2003, Barack Obama lavished praise on Rashid Khalidi, a mouthpiece  for Yasser Arafat.  In the room were Weather Underground members Bill  Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn.  It was all caught on video.  The Los Angeles  Times blandly mentioned the tape in passing a few months ago, but I'm  told there is more to it than that - the tape shows enough sympathy from  Barack Obama toward the causes of an Islamic radical that the American  public has a right to see the tape.    But the Los Angeles Times will not release the tape.  Peter Wallsten, a  reporter for the Los Angeles Times has seen the tape.  He wrote about  the tape  http://paracom.paramountcommunication.co...  051405:836808B593C2BD7F1A8C7E549F7C43F... .    Email Peter Wallsten at peter.wallsten@latimes.com.  Tell him to release  the tape.    Call the Los Angeles Times at (213) 237-5000.  Tell the Times the  American public has a right to see this for themselves.    Please forward this to your friends and encourage them to call too.  Use  the link below my signature to ensure they get the email in proper  formatting.    Sincerely yours,       I wish they would release it!  
VElNUno7aa	He is getting confused with all his lies.|`|ef2911f8d21cd85ee3398706a59e0e47aa	It's belt tightening because he is going to cut away unnecessary programs and cut the loopholes that allow the wealthy to mask their money while the middle class has to pay.    He is going to plug up the 10 billion dollar a month hole by which we are currently bleeding.  that's a huge belt-tightener right there.      But, because of our Administration's obsession with Saddam and Iraqi oil, we have taken our eye off the ball on several fronts.  Education, Infrastructure, worker retrofitting, etc.  Obama's plans, if you actually read them, lay out exactly how he will pay for these programs, mostly by shifting money away from things like the War in Iraq and holding people to the taxes they should have been paying all along.    Think about it like this: the government was able to magically make 700 Billion dollars appear, in an effort to bail out the mortgage lenders.  Somehow, in this economy, we are finding 10 billion dollars a month to spend in Iraq.  If we brought this money home and invested in our own country, we'd have a surplus again (like the LAST Democratic Administration had!)    goBama!|`|sOpIMeJSaa	through out history of this nation it was the republican leadership that always put this country in financial mess. the democratic leadership has always put the country back together, read your history and you won't be complaining about obama. see what party was in the white house when we had serious financial crisseses.

Let's see how much you know about Warren Buffett. Since he is such a "great american" how many American stocks has he owned in the last 30 years? And name them? Can you do it? Without looking it up on Google? If you knew, you would see that his number one concern is himself and his money, not America.    EDITL: My point is that there is a difference between being a socialist, and supporting a socialist politician because you can get rich or richer in his case, because of this politician. No, in fact it is the ULTIMATE in capitalism: cashing in on the back of a socialist leader. But that still doesn't mean Buffett agrees with his economic politics. It just means he can cash in because he has more ties to Obama.    No it doesn't. If you were a communist dictator and you had 1 billion dollars that I could bilk off of you through odd connections here and there, I would. SIMPLY BECAUSE I COULD. I would say "I support you" in whatever you do, because I would know at the end of the road would be a billion dollars for me. So is Buffet a socialist or communist for doing that? no. Is he a pimp? Yes. But hey, pimps were the first middle men, capitalists in the world. So whatever floats his boat. But it doesn't mean he supports communism or socialism. He only supports getting paid, period.    That is why until recently he has only owned TWO American stocks, for like 30 years! Does that sound like a man who is too interested in supporting America in any way? Hell no. It is a man who is about making money, any way he can, even if that means he will "support" Obama. I bet some behind the scenes deals are going on as well to sweeten any pot Buffett may be getting for his "support" too. We'll see.|`|AA11142889	Because Buffet and Schmidt are intelligent and well informed.|`|L7wJwbjDaa	There is always an oligarchy at the top in a socialist/communist government.

The stimulus checks were poor economics, they would have been more  effective in rebuilding the social superstructure. Rich people got the same amount of money as the poor, which was not fair. Bush is a big scam artists and all he wanted to do is bribe people to vote for McCain. Alas it won't work and  will be our next President 
iVv6bFW2aa	Many  republicans oppose the income tax, because they feel ripped off. This because it's a very weak progressive tax i.e the higher the income the higher percentage and amount is paid. However it is not progressive enough, because still the rich are not paying their share and get a lot of breaks. However since, these capitalists are  greedy, they prefer a flat tax or a sales tax which wouldn't be tied to earnings . If such tax was implemented everyone rich or poor would pay say 9%, in effect this would hurt the poorest more, because they spend a higher percentage of their income to stay alive.This tax was proposed by the Editor of Fortune Magazine, so imagine whence it  came  from. It's author was Steve Forbes, the editor and candidate for President on the GOP ticket.Fortunately he didn't even win the GOP primary|`|P1VXjLPOaa	Can you ask that question again in english. |`|sxJzbGs0aa	It's a common tax across all states.

a5fb058c06535370bbdc0e9afa7e3ab3aa	the reality is that they refuse to see that it does not. You are talking to people whose minds are like concrete. Totally mixed up and permanently set  If they would unbury their heads and see the end result of voodoo economics,they just need to take a look at Iceland. In 1991, they employed all of Friedman's teachings about trickle down economics.  The result- while they produced some billionaires, they have managed in 17 years to bankrupt their nation.Iceland has 300,000 people,  yet they owe over $60 BILLION dollars and are bankrupt and trying to borrow money from Russia. We are teetering on the brink. If we allow McBush to take over, we will end up just like Iceland, This "Wall Street" meltdown is a freaking wake up call|`|HOTDwmEoaa	I don't uhderstand the wording of your question.  It seems to be implying that there was once a time when trickle-down did work.  Not in my lifetime, and I'm 60!|`|AA11858035	Trickle down economics is just a polite way to say the rich are going to piss on the middle class.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	They probably realize it except for the fools who don't know about economics, and want to assuage their conscience, as if they had any.Of course when jobs are outsourced, there is no trickle down,because the money remains overseas, even though it's taken by American Corporations. The ones who know about economics are scamming the American worker.Their motives are greater profits abroad at lower wages, and an absence of honest labor unions which are a threat to American capitalists.I would either prohibit outsourcing, or tax them so heavily that it wouldn't be worth their while. incidentally very often countries which have treaties with the US, become north american colonies.

So how do you explain an unemployment rate at only 6%?  The rich do NOT create jobs oversees.  The government does drive jobs away with the tax rate and the cost of regulations.  Maybe we should raise taxes more to get them to stay???    By the way, on the subject of budget deficits when we lower the marginal tax rate we raise tax revenues.  The top 1% paid 37% of all taxes in 2000.  Then Bush took over and lowered the marginal tax rate.  The top 1% now pay 39% of all income taxes (that's a 2% increase in revenues for you mathematically challenged democrats).    Raising tax rates hurts the economy.  In recent times Carter, Bush (the first one) and Clinton all found that out.    Obama's idea is to give a one-time $3000 tax credit per employee hired.  So unless the employee is only making $57 a week that is not going to be an incentive to hire anyone.  And the $3000 employee will be fired the second year after the tax credit is no good.

It looks like he has held on to win!  There is a chance that his conviction will be thrown out on appeal.  If the conviction stands he will be thrown out of office.

Obama says McCain is another Bush...and Bush is being blamed for the bad economy.    It doesn't make sense though. For the past two years, the democrats have been in charge of both the house and senate...yet they did nothing to stave off the Fannie Mae Freddie Mac thing even though they were warned by McCain....and Obama said he issued a warning also (although that is not backed up on paper). I think that the people often forget that there are 535 other people who make the decisions...before George W. can do anything. And for at least the last two years, the democrats were the majority of that 535. So who should take the blame???? 
NrKj9KgPaa	What a bunch of kool-aid drinking fools with blinders on!    The military budget of the United States is presently bloated with waste and inefficiencies that can be cut out to provide for a STRONGER American military. In addition, the presence of American military forces in so many places all over the world (many of which do not appreciate from their presence) is unnecessary and invites attacks on them and on the US in general. WE DO NOT NEED TO BE THE WORLD'S POLICEMAN!     As for Senators Obama and Reid and Congresswoman Pelosi, I have really never liked Pelosi or Reid. Believe it or not, even I think they are a bit too far to the left, as well as being politically naive (or incompetent - take your pick). I have yet to see any actual plan by either of them to gut the military budget to the point of making the military ineffective. They (like Senator Obama) have proposed military budgets that cut out the fat and the inefficiencies that are wasteful and a major drag on our economy.     Finally, regarding your claim that "the USA is the last hope against terrorists," do you regard all of our allies as impotent or unwilling to take effective action? Israel has certainly been a staunch ally in the fight against terrorism in the Middle East, and the UK has been at our side through thick and thin since WW2. Other European and Western Hemisphere allies will always look out for their own interests, but so do we! We can still work with them to defend against terrorist threats.    |`|AA11284831	When did they state that they'd cut defense?  You never actually HEARD any of them say that they'd do that, so please don't state it as fact.  You may have heard some idiot such as Rush, Hannity or Levin say so, but that doesn't make it true.    Obama's position on maintaining our military might is quite clear.

But if he's decreasing company value, then the board needs to be looking for a new CEO, and if there isn't anyone with a proven track record, salary and benefits ought to be decreased.

THAT is stealing.  I believe everyone should be taxed the same... Obama is trying to be Robin Hood.  I agree that Obama has the right idea - it isn't exactly fair for some people to be living like kings and queens while others are going without food and shelter... but I don't think it is fair to take their money either.  We (AMERICA) have investments in a lot of CRAP that isn't necessary.  There are government funded experiments and programs that are taking away from the really important things like providing EVERYONE with proper education opportunities.    Jesus said GIVE to the poor... not take from the rich.  I believe that there are many good people who want to give money and most of those rich people DO give money... BUT just because they have money doesn't mean they should be obligated to give anything.  If I won the lotto I wouldn't think it would be fair for the government to tell me that I HAVE to set my whole family up in nice homes and buy them cars...

He would eliminate the dough nut hole in Medicare Plan D, that would mean that a person would not have to spend a total of $5,100 ot of pocket, before receiving catastrophic coverage with a 5% co payment for  medication. People would be able to import medications from other countries and across state lines. This not allowed at present..The Federal Government would be able to negotiate for the whole Medicaid/Medicare complex to receive bulk discounts as does the A. Bush and McCain oppose it obviously to ingratiate themselves with big Pharma.  These Obama proposals although an improvement are too week to solve the problem. The  only reforms that McCain would allow is to permit people to buy insurance across State lines. Also to receive a $5,000 a year, to help pay medical and pharmacy coverage. But this would be taxed and would be of no use to low income persons. Therefore McCain would maintain the status quo.

A4vc2Dg9aa	Because the bailout was on the agenda of the Powers That Be (Bilderbergs, CFR, Trilateral Commission, World Bank, IMF) - who control the Federal Reserve and ALL of the major politicians and BOTH major political parties.    This was a setup to take advantage of the People in the name of "rescuing" the economy (what BS), and was in effect a power-grab giving Paulson dictatorial power in US finance.    It was a done-deal and they bought off or threatened enough congesspersons to get it applroved.|`|twu7f8M8aa	They're both big money politicians with different rhetoric.  Much of Obama's money comes from Wall Street, specifically Goldman Sachs.  |`|AA11313983	They both back socialism.  It would have made more sense for one of them to take the opposing stance, just to paint himself as being different.  Last I checked, the bailout hasn't worked out too well.

Warren Buffet is an Obama supporter.  It's logical to assume that he would be a frontrunner for that position in an Obama administration.    John McCain might choose Joe the Plumber ... who knows?  Joe obviously knows more about finance than the rest of us.|`|DLsdhfuuaa	Secretary of the Treasury - George Soros (Has been accused of causing economic crisises in both the UK and Asia)    And for the answer to the question Obama supporters deleted:    Secretary of Defense - Khalid al-Mansour (White people dont feel bad, whatever you do to them, they deserve it, you cut out the nose, cut out the ears, take flesh out of their body, dont worry because God wants you to do it.)  Secretary of Homeland Security - Bill Ayers (familiar with bombings)  Secretary of State - Reverend Wright ("God damn America!" Our enemies will love him)
klkSiZlKaa	Neoconservatism is largely the product of William F. Buckley, Barry Goldwater, the Cold War, and Reaganism.  GWB is just a product of that "family" and mentality, and much of his cabinet members and advisers were part of Reagan's cadre: Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Ridge, Karl Rove, Reagan, Hannity, O'Reilley.    The "neo" is a way of describing the more aggressive -- and I would say imperialist -- foreign policy of a conservative administration.  The government is no longer small, because it must fund a more global military-industrial complex and transnational capitalism.  Many parts of the world -- i.e. the "Third World" -- are not capitalist or capitalized, and so neo-conservatism is a new (less diplomatic) way of going about this.  This puts more financial pressure and social strain on the domestic economy.    For an example, Americans usually talk about Vietnam as "containment."  But it was, in many ways, more like neo-conservative imperialism.  Its intent was not "human rights," but to maintain a capitalist market in Southeast Asia.  The military was used to do this, even though the Vietnamese had already issued their own Declaration of Independence.     Iraq is another example.  It is imperialism disguised as "liberation."    The "neo" doesn't fit well with the "conservative" in the American context because, while the government gets bigger and the Empire gets bigger, Conservatives still value patriotism, which preaches "closed borders" in the United States.  This is a contradiction whereby the money flows freely but the labor cannot.  But conservatives otherwise hold on to what they call "traditional values," which in the US are often religious.|`|FHx4XYVzaa	moderate political conservatism espoused or advocated by former liberals or socialists. |`|CNroVD24aa	Neoconservatives are Democrats who are classical liberals and left the party when it became too progressive. They turned their backs on relativist morals and the nonsense of the 1960s. They also believe in an interventionist approach to world politics and in spreading freedom and democracy.    Irving Kristol is considered the founder, along with Norman Podhoretz. Jeanne Kirkpatrick is a famous neoconservative. George W. Bush did not adopt a neoconservative view on foreign policy until after 9/11.
xRxKyDKoaa	It would depend on how cold it gets and the demand for heating oil. If it gets to record breaking cold the demand will rise and costs go up..the only way to help keep costs down is to make sure you home is insulated properly and windows and doors have good seals...it's also to keep you temps down while sleeping and toss on an extra blanket and wear a sweater during the day...trying to keep spring like temps in the house is not good economically.  Usually the oil companies or gas companies have brochures for more ideas.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I doubt it because taxes on oil will be increased and the companies will pass these down to the consumers|`|yS0hSFdOaa	If you heat your home with oil, yes it will be a lot cheaper than last year. Let's hope it stays low.|`|a147f4a5dec8360a104ee27ba2eb3018aa	No, while the cost of oil has dropped the cost of other energy sources continue to rise.

Thanks, Franks, Raines, ACORN, and "Wingnut".|`|XuLVfj1caa	No.  The oil companies aren't stupid.  They know that if they continue to gouge us we'll work harder to find other energy sources.  They're scaling back prices so they can continue to count on the U.S. as a customer.  Prices will rise surely rise again.|`|secffswqaa	Heating should be cheaper for most folks:    Natural gas is down significantly.    Electric where generated by natural gas (East Coast and Texas I believe) is down a lot.    Based on the price of Diesel, I'd venture that fuel oil isn't down as much as gas and electric.  People in the Northeast will pay less this year, but not as much as those of us using Gas.

See I still believe in the American in Dream.    ******************  Is your HEAT coal or gas? >> Sorry with Obama's plan you do not get either.      Obama's tax Plan:  Professional Athlete, Celebrity Entertainer- 1-10 Million they do not care what taxes are.    However:  Doctors ( specialists), Nurse Practitioners, Technical Engineers Around 100,000 - 250,000 a year. These are just a few of the people you choose to condemn.      Make a point to know the candidate behind the media!    Obama supporters want you to pay. It is about what you owe them. Share the wealth. Higher taxes, Cut the military spending, Kill our soldiers we will not need them anyway we will have a militia.More job loss, Tax 401k, Capitol Gains taxes, Inheritance tax ( for the sake of your kids do not write a will.. they will pay! ), Continue to buy oil from foreign Nations maybe we can all be friends!  Ignore the coal we are sitting on! Save the whales we can all live like tarzan ( Robinson Caruso did ok). Do not speak about religion or any other confrontational ideas. The Militia will get you!  -or-  Perhaps they believe in job security.. for congress!    McCain - Palin '08  Drill baby Drill  Clean Coal Tech!  Nuclear Energy  New technology and New Jobs!  Cut the Pork and keep taxes low!  Win the war and bring our Boys home Victorious So we do not have to go back again!  Decrease our oil dependence on foreign war nations.  Keep America a Democracy and Say no to Socialism  |`|vyXHyOX5aa	Even if he won the toss up states, he wouldn't stand a chance unless some sort of miracle happened and he gained votes from another state that Obama already has, highly doubt it.|`|gS1cZ9pRaa	I still think its any ones game as long as everyone gets out to vote.

But I'm hoping he doesn't win.|`|EZuKQWsyaa	You always have hope and pray to GOD that McCain can win this election. If you don't, your entire life changes when the election chose another path. Its not the media that controls it, its also the voters that count because they worry about the stock market more than the war. Plus Obama is the blame. He talks about Bush more than his plans. And that's why Obama will die soon if he is elected as the president of this nation.   VOTE JOHN MCCAIN supporter  1|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Not if this is an honest election.

No I am not a McCain supporter, nor an Obama supporter, however, I know that most Obama supporters will be to busy screaming their heads off about the system exploiting the poor or how racist all Mccain supporters are to go out and vote.|`|EZ5mwUF3aa	McCain win?

They have no control on how people will ultimately vote, until the final outcome.|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	With so many new voters this time the only question is how many of them will actually vote. Obama is heavily favored by the young gullible naive voters. If they are too stoned to make it to the polls older smarter and less easily fooled voters just might elect McCain.|`|fShlKEfYaa	Please vote for McCain! McCain is the best experienced and a more moderate candidate than we have had in a long-time.  Of course both candidates have a chance, the polls show a landslide for the DNC, but that means you still need to show up for the GOP to vote because the polls might lacj credibility as much as the media has lacked credibility.|`|8928369727a00e94f6726cdbfe2d8dd0aa	Nope and i hope not!!|`|juG7X5gyaa	Youbetcha he does!|`|rYT9OnXzaa	I honestly don't.|`|AArXiDtWaa	I do.|`|YPvyvDzQaa	ABSOLUTELY!!!|`|bODwmOFVaa	God be with John McCain.God help us|`|tDHTtLtLaa	NO!|`|AA11682425	i'm sure McCain does|`|5mCAscCnaa	They said Bush had no chance, and that Kerry was going to beat him....

The fact that the media is against him so blatantly tells me that he is doing much better than everyone thinks!    God help us.|`|8Me8JpEXaa	Well, Obama remains the favorite.

GO & VOTE !!!!!|`|DlzSQxXcaa	You and BuSH (no not fair & square)|`|dmYLdv5eaa	I think alot of people still think he can win. Fortunately, these people can think all they want b/c thinking does not make a winner.  Obama pretty much has this election in the bag
NlOtwCqgaa	There are many people in this election that have no clue what the facts are, and will chose who to vote for based off of "fear tactics" used by either side.  They will then complain when things don't go the way they expected things to, and blame the other side for their supposed misfortune. (notice how many people on this board are still blaming Clinton?).    People with a brain will look at the issues, check the facts, and chose accordingly. As you quoted, it's clear that the Obama tax plan will benefit the middle class much more than the McCain plan will, but many people will listen to the "Obama wants to tax you to death! he'll take your money and give it to people who don't work" drivel.      oh.. and BTW.. that http://colony14.net/id41.html site quotes from republican blogs and wikipedia.. yeah.. excellent source of information, try getting that by a teacher or college professor as a viable source.|`|zkovxRseaa	whether he's planted or not, his ideas are not sprouting any growth for the GOP|`|a20537f9e60f7882d8fd2800775d174caa	Anything you had to say after Joe the "Planted" Plumber is worthless since you revealed your true bias immediately with that phrase.

That is why so many billions have been spent recently constructing a virtual fence (consisting of radar, infrared, and unmanned drones) along the northern border, and why the US is sharing enforcement responsibilities on behalf of the Canadian government to catch americans trying to leave not enter america. It is also why the government is sharing confidential records on all americans with foriegn immigration authorities, because governments like Canada refuse entry for as little as a past DUI or marijuana violation, they are able to cut off mobility to a sizeable percentage of the population there alone. America is becoming incarcerated and the population is being duped into accepting it by way of a mass hysteria over illegal immigration.    The NWO has indoctrinated people with the delusions of border legitimacy and soveriegn birth rights to convince people that something they own is being taken from them- which is a downright lie. One may control their home and their home alone, it is created by them thus they own it. The earth however was here long before man or governments so it is illogical to assume that due to birth one may lay claim to all of the land within thousands of miles of some man made lines in the dirt, but not land far closer which happens to be on the other side of those lines. Ones claims are only legitimate in their own residence beyond that it is land hogging theft of the earth. The goal is a global government controlling much smaller isolated and incarcerated populations.

The more taxes you can raise on the middle class so you can "spread the wealth".     I cant believe anyone would vote for this guy. That was the straw that broke the camels back. Spread my wealth. AH...How about you lazy bums get a education. Don't quit school; work at the fast food joint. Then wonder why your life sucks. It took me 15 years to get where I am financially.

Obama and his friends Harry and Nancy may not fit your little college poli sci course definition, 'socialist' is still the word that comes closest to Sen. Obama's views and agenda. I applaud you for paying attention in class, but I chastise you for not being able to expand your literal understanding of the word to its current, wider meaning.     "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs." ~ Kark Marx, the Communist Manifesto    Sound familiar? Sen. Obama believes pretty much the same thing. Now, if you do not feel as though your limited and literal definition of 'socialism' sits well with Sen. Obama's agenda of expanded government, increased social spending, higher taxes and greater controls on business, please tell us which word you would prefer that we use and we'll be happy to comply. Until then, 'socialist' will suffice.     You might also share with us your economic rationale for believing that sucking a greater share of the life blood out of an economy to support an increasing dependency of the population on a growing, more powerful government is a good thing and leads to your European affluence and greater prosperity. I submit that it does not. I've lived and worked in socialist countries and while they're surviving, I would not call them 'affluent'. In fact, they tend to have significantly higher unemployment, significantly higher taxes and greater difficulty meeting their financial obligations. |`|flrOp5YLaa	Stars for you!

Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, military, public schools, police, firemen, unemployment, etc.      It is patriotic for the rich to help the poor of their nation.  Therefore it is patriotic for everyone to pay their "fair" share of taxes.  And yes, in this election, a lot of people have erroneously referred to Obama's plan as socialism in a negative way.     I guess all these people make more than $200,000.00 per year?    Good for them, for the rest of the 95% of workers, wake up and smell the coffee.

I believe it.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	I don't know any dim-witted Palins, but I do know an articuate, intellegent and strong woman named Palin that is running for VP, and community organizers do nothing but feed from the public trough!|`|WmgqUYnjaa	No way will that happen...If they can't script it for her then they do not want her on!|`|cPuicv06aa	I believe McCain told Larry King twice, that Sarah Palin would appear on his show prior to election day!  I doubt it will happen at all.  They can't take that chance.  She's safe on SNL.  |`|iVv6bFW2aa	No I don't think he lied. He may have been lied to by John McCain.I think the GOP and her minders are split on this issue , some feel that she would be an embarrassment,and Larry King would make mincemeat out of her, whereas others are so desperate that they would allow her on the show in order to get publicity, whether positive or negative. Neither strategy will work I would say her chances of accepting the invitation would be fifty fifty.|`|HamL63Dtaa	McCain can NEVER lie
iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, there is an element of racism, when they call Obama a Muslim. The rest is simple re baiting and guilt by association. Bachman is an intolerant religious fundamentalist on the order of Sarah Palin. These smears are also a result of the GOP's desperation at losing the election. Besides Bachman is a liar, when she denied making the statement, although videotapes exist confirming her statement Both Bachman and Palin are doingMcCain'ss dirty work. However none of this is working and Obama will be our  next President|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	I think they were politically motivated.  The GOP has gone off the deep end in trying to support McCain.  They will say and do anything.|`|ea5aa2ea8f93a0625b6b2aff541041c7aa	NO, to her anybody to the left of far right is anti-American.  She is a bigot, not necessarily a racial bigot.  And a crackpot.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	No, they were politically motivated.  Republicans accuse Democrats of being anti-American all the time.  |`|bQLQdRBZaa	Yes|`|faAlDRWBaa	How low?  They have been calling people anti-American for years for anyone who has opposing view points.      This is neither new nor surprising. |`|iEneyLM5aa	No.  They were motivated by stupidity.  I love the fact that she apparently doesn't regret what she said. she just regrets saying it on national TV.|`|Uwad1Irmaa	no, just stupidity motivated|`|rJHM0sgcaa	No, it was a party rant. By her standards anyone who is not pro-republican is anti-American.|`|2xdbxlT7aa	no he is a far left socialist and is anti american if for no other reason than that. Socialism is anti american.|`|2uOv1eSnaa	yes, it is just more of the only things republicans have to cling to, trying to scare people that obama is muslim.  i am tired of the politics of fear.  we need hope|`|zq7vE7Bhaa	No. I don't think the fact that she's caucasian makes her stupid, and her remarks thus stupidly motivated. Rather, she's a product of the ignorant racist environment in which she was raised. Rep. Backham and Sarah Palin for that matter are both products of the racist environments in which they were raised. 
Oa2q6DFYaa	Amen, my friend!    Edit:   Note that The RNC's national security strategy embraces preemptive strikes.  Google:  U.S. Army Doctrine And Belligernt Ocucupations.|`|VWIggGYvaa	Bill Clinton has no credibility, therefore I would not believe a word he had to say.|`|RLRLRysjaa	No I don't agree with that.  I love Bill but he's just wrong on this one.  The Republican ideology was radically changed in the early 90s with their alignment with Moral Majority and other evangelical nutjobs who poured billions of dollars into the RNC.  The Republicans ideas on display from that time up until now bear little to no resemblence to the ideas on which the Republican party was founded.|`|AA10482044	Same Bill that followed and stuck to Conservative spending plans throughout his tenure, the Bill that inherited a terrified Opec undercut by Bush 1's puppet Saddam giving us nearly free oil for a decade?  The idiocy that is allowing Banks to loan an infinite amount so they can big up capital 'assets' while credit reference agencies charge fees for doing nothing is down to both parties and all the rich.  Of course they made money while the credit bubble blew up and more when they sold up just before it burst but their system caused the hardships we've had and the near slavery we are going to get.  So no, it was timing, a putz could have put on a good show in his time, they only follow 'advisers' anyway, life is all about timing..|`|AA11193401	no
Wlt9Ypjkaa	Interesting question. Bush has promised to inform Obama of major issues. But in practice, I think they've tended to keep their own council and wait until the incumbent is out of office to do their thing. They have enough on their plates as it is -- choosing cabinet members, deciding what policies they'll push for first, etc.|`|hgmuilOcaa	Little to none.  Until they are sworn in, they are a nothing.
F4IjI9qaaa	A lot!!!  So many people are blaming him for everything that is wrong - and by extension the republicans. Many voters are going Democrat as their way of sending Bush a message. I get their point but that's not the way to build a better America. Each candidate should be looked at independent of party affiliation.|`|2f8fcc269ee1c0aaa19aed69d01a15ccaa	Very little every one is happy he is leaving soon.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Well, none really.  Though he hurt the Republican candidate right out of he gate. . .    Nothing like ruining it for everyone else, huh?|`|MxqmRhESaa	none?|`|eNl8GhPUaa	mccain doesn't even want his endorsement and is bending over backwards to look like he doesn't even know him, so i'd say none.
9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	Obama and Biden , the best choice. those two people know how to talk without resorting to mud slinging on their opponents. Obama never lost his temper in debates and express his opinions in an assertive manner.|`|rSnqTx4Eaa	well I voted for McCain but Pallin's voice is the most annoying (it's like nails on a chalk board sometimes)|`|802e9d669a5109d676d5dbd871d86d46aa	Obama for sure i dont know whoz really best for prez job but Obama who speech level is defiantly way higher then other 3s, his voice attracts you to listen wat he saying|`|D3e3teRSaa	Obama's is a rich, mellow voice; Palin's is shrill and grating, and the prospect of listening to her for four years makes my stomach come to my mouth.|`|xGkJGvSiaa	palin shes so hot|`|3tuwWidiaa	Obama has a distinctive voice, but I can see it grating on people.  McCain sounds loopy, so no.  Palin's voice is one that you either love or hate.  Biden has a boring voice.  But, at that, it's likely the easiest to listen to for a long time.    Of course, this is outside of politics or caring what any of them are saying.|`|eFm5LxTQaa	Palin irks me to no end so I guess Biden.|`|X801aO6raa	McCain, I can shtand hish voice. He whistles when he says something with an S. Obama pauses every 2 seconds. Palin has some Canadian village accent or something. I liked Bill Clintons voice.|`|3a6nQRKiaa	Palin has a very annoying voice and sentence structure.  On top of not making any sense.  Obama sometimes sounds monotonous(rare).  Biden is not bad, but Obama is usually electrifing when he talks.  McCain sounds stained and nervous when he talks(not a good speaker).   I would say Barack takes the cake on this one.  
ex9GJHeiaa	He's still running for the office and there is no law against a convicted felon running for Senate...which seems a bit screwy to me. |`|gYTggPu0aa	She could, but will not.  The seat does not have those committees.  They are assigned by the party heads.  She would not get them automatically.|`|d81768a69a6f5ac373aad13bfe79da5daa	no she cant she has had her ethical issues too|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Yep. And I hope she does if she does not become VP. We need her guts in the almost gutless Senate.|`|2f1IEC1Qaa	perfect couldn't happen to a better state and party let us all see her in glorious action in the senate
vIXC0tfZaa	well i think that we need is a new president and "try" to forget about the past |`|418d2e9812dceb72c6c1d038184e789baa	Still has a  higher approval rating than Nancy Pelosi. Obama voted with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time. That is something that the liberal run media wont tell you.|`|BsQcplTQaa	the fact that our Democratic congress is rated even lower doesn't faze you? Hes not running for reelection. And there   are some rather profound differences between Bush and McCain. Pity its easier for you to try and hook them together than find out the facts.|`|Xl12DiXoaa	I agree with you on Bush/McCain. But i don't think Obama will be any better...|`|hDkGc9uAaa	First of all America is very hypocritical. Bush didnt do anything different first term compared to second term. Yet, he was voted in a second time. Just because someone doesnt like one thing he does doesnt mean that people dont like him.     And another thing McCain is not Bush so stop saying he is. He voted with the REST OF AMERICA on certain policies such as pro-war and pro-life. I like my president to have morals so please dont go bashing him because he and McCain are both republicans.|`|0utahjDCaa	I love W and am so happy he was my President for 8yrs.  |`|d2d6d1d2d206350f4858f15ffbfaafa3aa	I don't think there is such a thing as a disapproval rating, but his approval rating is pretty low.   There is no way that McCain would be a continuation of Bush's presidency since he has been such a renegade in the GOP.    The news networks love to focus on Bush's low approval rating, but seem to ignore the approval rating of congress, which was at about 9% last I heard.    The news could legitimately say that Bush's approval rating is 3X as high as Congress's.    I admire both Bush and his predecessor, Clinton, for the same reason.  They both have been presidential and stuck to their guns, whether you agree with them or not.    
g2idZEKFaa	Should of done it 20 years ago  .  When Florida was becoming a densely populated little Cuba  .|`|tlt26cHraa	Yes.|`|64d77l4qaa	Absolutely they should.    The US has been the instigator in much of the Cuban conflict, so why should the Cuban people be punished? The US government conducts business with countries which have far worse human rights records. There is absolutely no reason why relations wth Cuba should still be how they are today.|`|HOTDwmEoaa	Of course they should.  The civilized world already has (or never stopped to begin with).  I wasn't all that impressed with their cigars, but I enjoyed the Havana Club rum.|`|3tNTOtc4aa	Yes, immediately.   This vendetta against Cuba has gone on for long enough. It's time to end it.|`|w8lwOcG4aa	Should have done it 15 years ago.  Cold War is over, has been for a while.  The argument I hear against is that line about human rights and lack of democratic freedoms. I don't think that stops Saudi princes from dining in the White House or China lending the US hundreds of billions of $$$$.|`|BImIMnbzaa	  What makes you think the Cubans want normalization with the US, now that their Russian buddies are back ?    As long as the Castro's have influence there, it's best left alone.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	yes. the first step should be lifting embargo on Cuba. next shut down Guantanamo , next release Cuban 5 who are  wrong fully confined in the us prisons  |`|a997600547e93bd02730b85822f8507faa	No.  Russia is talking to Cuba about maybe placing missiles on Cuba.  That seems real familiar with the last Cuban missile crisis.  |`|Dr5rSROiaa	Yes.  In fact, since Raul Castro has been the head of the Cuban Government, the island has been promoting its tourism industry more and more.  Also, the fears of Communism (largely distorted by right-wing war hawks in the 1950s and resurrected in the 1980s by Ronald Reagan) is slowly dying down.  We are the only Western nation that does not trade with Cuba.  I imagine that Obama will address this issue with more of an open mind than did his predecessors.  |`|Wx35zRTYaa	No. We should blow them off the earth.|`|AA11203238	Sure why not, it is only a communistic country that wants our downfall.  So what if they are close to our borders, but we need to have normalize relationships so they can ship over a Abomb to one of our cities.    Then then again, communist loves communists.  And Obama loves Cuba.|`|aNq5T59kaa	Always a good idea to have good relations with your neighbor if everything is within reason.  Our reason for the embargo was over years ago.  Time to mend relations.|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	yes, I think we should.      We deal with China, a communist country. Why not Cuba?  Why prevent millions of Americans from visting their relatives, and visiting the place they were born?  Surely it would be mutually beneficial for both countries.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Yes.|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes.|`|8yE2sYGeaa	We should, only to cut the Castro Brothers power there|`|AA12365543	We should have normalized relations in 1991. Then we could have gotten Americans businesses in Cuba. Now European ones are already there buying up all the good sites and resources so we are screwed.|`|AA11620976	I think that we should expand the Monroe Doctrine  and begin to  fulfill Obama's 57 state vision and make  Cuba, Haiti , The Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico The US Virgin Islands The Bahamas and Bermuda US states.  The sad fact of the matter is that most of those people would live lot better if we did that  New colonialism: It's good thing   Side note:  Since Obama IS the President-elect maybe it's time for YA spell check to recognize that the plural form of Obama is not IBM's
AA11777322	It didn't fall apart over night, so it will take a while to get it back on track.  Patience is going to be needed as we work on getting the economy back in shape.|`|JXwJ0tKxaa	no telling he says as soon as he can but its going to take sometime. maybe a year he said|`|qf5XwXLqaa	By spending more money? It will take a while.|`|94f4a8fd53e7c72a552389e5ac74586faa	The United States has a lot of recovery, and it will take many years. Hopefully sooner than later.|`|gf5ysBCnaa	It may take several years extending beyond his first term. But I believe he will get it done with our support, libs, repub all democrates, etc the whole gambit will be needed to drive this country towards progress. |`|vR8bN1n4aa	The economy is an enigmatic being, and no one truly understands how to manipulate it. If you believe Obama can fix it by himself, or even with help from Congress, you will be disappointed. Just because the "hope" and "change" guy won doesn't mean anything good will happen. "Hope" is over rated and nearly every politician is for changing things - the majority of Americans just got schooled.|`|FFCo9cgbaa	well its simple.  Give KFC billions to expand their empire so his kind may breed.|`|LqAht2csaa	Increasing government spending will not help us. Neither will increasing taxes on the wealthy (because it's the people under the wealthy that would be feeling the burn.) The only way Obama will help the economy is through his message of hope. Often times people spend more because they have more confidence in the system and that consumer spending will help the economy. As to how long it will take, that depends on how long people can realistically ride on his message of hope. 
kIE9TxvWaa	I agree with you, but for some people politics unfortunately has become a religion in its own state which is bullshit.  It just makes matters worse.|`|JthubNIsaa	Have you heard of "Sea Steading yet?" There a group of investors right now that are planning to construct a platform city out in international waters. They, apparently, are working out their bylaws and stuff and trying to figure out criteria for folks who want to live on board. Of course, we all know how Waterworld worked out so I'm not so sure it's a good idea. Besides, it won't eliminate evil.|`|7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	Evil will leave us when the Republican party disappears.|`|f6Qad0usaa	Destroy mankind and "evil" will go away.   But the truth is that there is no good and there is no evil..it is all relative and highly subjective.    |`|AA11223214	 How can you define Good, without there being an Evil ? There has to be a yardstick to measure by.      Politics is driven by people's base desires, whether it's  to share or to take, to accept or to reject, to tolerate or draw a line. Unless and until you change human's basest desires and instincts, politics will always have "dirt" associated with it. "My way is better" is always a byproduct of political discussion. It comes down to if you are willing to compromise or not as to how successful or not the resulting interactions are. One look at the Democrats shows how hard it is for them to compromise - when Hillary lost the nomination, many of her supporters said they'd vote for McCain first. The Republicans, while horrified John McCain won due to moderate support, fell in line and supported him all the way. Republicans are far more inclined to not put up a fight indefinitely, whereas the liberal Democrats fanatically defend their turf to the very end, regardless of common good. One reason that politics has gotten SO partisan in the last 20 years, is that the Conservatives have finally had enough, and refuse to compromise with the Liberals anymore because they won't at all, so that has brought things to a standstill. Once the other side (Liberals)begin to compromise some, not just when they're in a minority, but when they are in control as well, will things improve. You can't reason with fanatics, and the Liberal Left has proven it has what it takes to EARN that label. I'm all for helping other people, but only when I HAVE a say, not what some left-leanist TELLS me that I have to support and when.... he or she can use their OWN money to help out then. They rarely do.      Sorry, hon, "greater good" is fine when you're in the cat-bird seat, but when people are just trying to make ends meet, it doesn't help to ask them to "sacrifice" when they haven't much to begin with. And taking from those who PROVIDE much of the business and jobs won't help. It seems it's those in the $100,000 - $250,000 range , not the super wealthy or middle-class or poor either, who are getting off easier, judging by that chart going around showing who's really paying the taxes. The upper 5% is paying a whopping 45%, while the middle class under $100,000 is paying another 40%, while the rest pay less or none. That nominally wealthy group needs to be the ones helping out more.     Sorry, but the USA is the GREATEST wealth-producer in the world, witness the panicked countries who depend on US to spend our money on their products, and the current crisis. Government should NOT be in business to  be creating jobs, only the private sector is efficient at that - however, I was reading that Government DOES help when it starts doing long-term science research projects and subs out work to private companies. Pure scientific research can pay off with spin-off industries and such , so much money could ( and should ) be spent in space and deep ocean exploration, to stimulate further economic benefits. THAT is what good government SHOULD be about.      Also, realize there IS no such thing as utopia - anyone who believes letting government run more and more areas of people's lives will enable that result is VERY ignorant of history and human nature. Government interferes, not helps, human advancement, unless it has some special checks on it's powers. Government will either get more evil, or try to be benignly invasive, and that's when it gets bad for everyone - when they think they are doing what's "best" for everyone concerned. As an example, the local Washington DC government can't even run an orphanage, they mistreat and abuse the kids, WHY would you trust them with anything if they can't take care of the most helpless, vulnerable, and needy? The courts have tried to intervene, but without firing the ones in charge ( oh, yes, they're black, and need those jobs ), in other words ACCOUNTABILITY, regardless of race, things won't improve.      To summarize - there's NO Utopian government , there are NO secure jobs ( except trash pickers, plumbers, liquor store employees, and lottery agents ), and there is no IDEAL way to achieve it. Until fundamental change comes to human nature, it's a dog-eat-dog, Me First world. Get used to it.       - The AMC Gremlin Guy -

u1F5RRReaa	I think the answer to that question is in the article you linked: "we're taking matters into our own hands"  Which, in this case, roughly translates as "we'll do what we like"    I think the US administration has kind of got it into its head that the whole of the middle east needs "straightening out" and they're the ones to do it.  And the lines between the people we're supposed to be fighting-the terrorists, and any Arab who carries a weapon, seem to be getting dangerously blurred.|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Bush needs to be arrested.|`|32cb8156ad7b656220324d46a1f150c3aa	to antagonize Russia for attacking Georgia      to instigate Iranian reaction      to incite Syrian Reataliation and use it as an excuse to attack Iran and Russia for creating a similar organiztion to OPEC|`|qhdhva5Daa	McCain needs an international crisis to get peoples minds off the economy and back to the "war".|`|DEglvDGDaa	well terrorists are cowards and hide amongst women and children, remember hezzbolah firing rockets and then iding behind children.    are you seriously saying that terrorists should not be touched because they hide amongst the civillian population|`|uAy7Y6HPaa	It's a well known fact that foreing fighters in Iraq are based in Syria.

If that was the case, then no helicopter would have been able to cross into Syria from Iraq.  If it is not the case, then if the US was behind this, it lends credence to any argument that Syria is not working hard enough to stop attacks being made in Iraq from bases in Syria.|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	Who knows if Syria's claims are true but in the current Bush regime, anything is possible.|`|55q8s8aAaa	I believe that it's their latest attempt on the "War with Terror".

A U.S. military official said the raid by special forces targeted the network of al-Qaida-linked foreign fighters moving through Syria into Iraq. The Americans have been unable to shut the network down in the area because Syria was out of the military's reach.    "We are taking matters into our own hands," the official told The Associated Press in Washington, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the political sensitivity of cross-border raids.    The attack came just days after the commander of U.S. forces in western Iraq said American troops were redoubling efforts to secure the Syrian border, which he called an "uncontrolled" gateway for fighters entering Iraq.    (taken from Yahoo news)    Of course, Al Jazeera would report that "8 civilians" died - because any time a non-uniformed combatant drops his weapon, in the eyes of our enemies he is suddenly a civilian.  It's amazing how many "unowned" or "abandoned" AK-47's can be found among a crowd of dead "civilians" after a U.S. military raid.|`|ucvtNcR1aa	A war crazed country with a mad president. 
fYcYPyR3aa	I agree, there should be no death penalty. Murdering th murderer brings us to their level and to be honest I think it's barbaric. People say they wouldn't mind killing the murderer because eithe murderer is not human, but surely if they are willing to kill another that makes THEM not human, if they call a murderer not human?    Others are saying there are too many people in our prisons so we should start the death penalty to make some space. That is disgusting. You would have people killed just so there is more space to put away other criminals? Why don't we just stop putting people in jail for stupid reasons, eg. not paying your TV licence. And people say that it costs OUR money to feed them ect. but does that mean human life has a price? I would rather pay money than have someone killed. It is very selfish to think, "hey someones going to be murdered because of death sentence but hey ho, thats 1 less I have to pay"    Oh yeah plus, quite a lot of people have been killled throught the death penalty and years after it turned out it wasn't them. You can take an innocent person from jail, but you can't bring them back to life.    It's not eye for an eye, Murder is wrong full stop, no exceptions and taking the life away from someone is murder (unless they are brain dead and you take them off life support because they aren't alive, their body is just still going because of the machine, or self-defence eg. if you don't kill them they will kill you) even if they have committed murder themselves.     There should be longer sentences, not time off for good behavious and life should mean life, not 25 years. Also they should be made to do things like some kind of community service.    I would hate to live in a country that had death sentence.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I think it's plausible. As liberal as I am, I support the death penalty.|`|3tNTOtc4aa	No self-respecting civilised country should have a death penalty.   It is a cruel and barbaric act and belongs in the past. Vicious murderers should be made face up to their crimes, not given the easy way out through the death penalty anyway. And life should mean life.    Furthermore if one innocent person is wrongly convicted and executed then that makes it all the more abhorrent.|`|AA11333480	Well it's an effective form of population control, and you can even be a little discriminating with it too, unlike other ways.|`|3nOmGp6Haa	What message does it give to the youth who have been taught murder is all wrong? Take a look at the newspapers recently? I don't think you have. Knife crime is becoming more common and is resulting in more and more murders.

It would be much better if they were hung up.|`|IJ63BhHjaa	i agree. it's outrageous how they say murder is wrong yet they give us an excuse that they're killing for the good of the people?? and yes our youth will get the wrong idea. longer sentences are good but our prisons are still overcrowded and they get better medical aid than half the people in america!!! and when they finally die That's still thousands of others society is willing to kill so boo for the death penalty and hooray for longer just sentencing!!!|`|EtOYeANLaa	Victims rights are paramount  Criminals rights well by committing a crime they lose their rights  Certain creeds are now wholesale murdering innocent people and the punishment for some is perceived martyrdom.

Additionally, I don't think we'd be killing criminals "just like that". I believe that the judicial system should give a criminal adequate means to prove their innocence, show that the crimes they committed do not warrant the death penalty, or that they have made a genuine attempt to turn their life around. A jury of intelligent and thoughtful people should have the wisdom to make the right decision concerning the punishment of a criminal.    Used sparingly, the death penalty is valuable to are judicial system.|`|AGgYsDnIaa	Bring back? Where did it go?|`|qVYwyrPSaa	I don't personally believe in the death penalty for moral reasons, I just don't agree with it.

Plus lets look at the countries who have the death penalty- China, Iran, Sudan, USA..

We are housing too many violent criminals feeding them and paying for their frivolous lawsuits and appeals. They should be allowed one chance to clear themselves using DNA otherwise executed ASAP. I believe that third time violent offenders should be executed.I do not believe in executing minors for any reason.  
AA12182122	~Those of us who used just a thimbleful of common sense back in '01 and '03 and opposed the illegal, unjustified, immoral and unjustifiable invasions then can only say, with much chagrin 'I told you so'.  Why were we such a tiny minority then, when it was so certain that the current situation inevitably had to come to pass?    As to Saddam, be aware that he was one of the six man hit team organized, trained and assisted by CIA when the US tried to take out Abd al-Karim Qasim in the 60s.  It was CIA sponsorship that led to the rise of the Baath Party and Saddam.  Saddam was the guy we wanted in charge because of his ruthlessness.  It was only after he threatened to nationalize the oil to pay for his reforms that he became the bad guy.    Al Qaeda and Osama?  They were the folks we built the terrorist camps for in Pakistan in the 70s and 80s.  They were the folks were armed and financed when they were doing our bidding in Afghanistan, back when we called them 'freedom fighters, nationalists and patriots'.  Even when the hostages were being held in Iran, we were doing deals with the captors to sponsor their terrorism.  They were heroes when the guns were pointed at Ivan and the Ruskie Bear.  Gee, when we double crossed them, they took offense and retaliated.  Fancy that.    The WTC leads in a straight line back to Operation Ajax, when CIA in 1953 overthrew the democratically elected reform government of the hugely popular Mohammad Mosaddeq.  CIA put Shah Reza Pahlavi back on the Peacock throne and then created, trained, organized and assisted SAVAK to keep him their.  It took 25 years, but the fundamentalist Iranians took their country back and it took a few more years, but they did begin to exact their revenge.  We are simply reaping now what we sowed then.    By the logic under which Georgie the Younger invaded Iraq and Afghanistan, one would have to admit the WTC was justified and the "right" thing for bin Laden to do.  After all, if we can invade in a preemptive war just because we don't like the way a sovereign nation governs itself, doesn't that necessarily work the other way around.  The North Koreans and Iran don't like the fact that we've got the world's largest stockpiles of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons or that we threaten to use them, we have used them in the past and, in the case of the nukes, remain the only nation on earth to have used them (and as folks like Eisenhower, Nimitz, MacArthur, Chief of Staff Leahy, a majority of the Manhattan Project scientists said before Little Boy fell that the Japanese were beaten, had already sued for peace and the weapons were unnecessary to shorten the war or save American lives - but that's another harangue).  Under the Bush logic, which was so loudly applauded by more than 90% of the unthinking, ignorant, American populace way back then, our precedent in Afghanistan and Iraq necessarily sanctions similar action by others against us.  What's good for the shooter is good for the target.    The problem is, now that we're there, we have the moral obligation to stay.  As those few of us said back when we were told we traitors to our country and ought to leave if we didn't like it (oops, our constitutional rights to speak out for common sense and human decency and the rule of law had to take a back seat to the chauvinistic hubris of our 'patriotic' brethren like Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity), when we break it, we own it.      Saddam was THE stabilizing force in the region.  That's why we put him there.  Now that he's gone, the power vacuum we created has got to be filled.  Someday, the Shiites, Sunnis and Kurds may be able to work together to fill it.  I'm not holding my breath.  Obama wanted to set a time-table to pull out.  He backed away from that, I hope.  Perhaps someone with a brain, a map and a working knowledge of the history of the region got to him and showed him the ignorance of his plan.      In any case, if we pull out before the situation is resolved and a strong Iraqi government (whatever form it takes, and democracy, given the ethnic and religious partisanship so extant in the area for so long may be the absolute worst scenario, especially for a people who have never been exposed to the concept) is in place, we are begging to go back in for the real wars that will follow.  How long before Syria or Egypt or Saudi Arabia or decide that for their own national security they have to move in when we leave?  How long after that before they turn on Israel?      Yes, I believe Iraq is in far worse shape today than before Georgie made his move.  So is the US.  Are Iran and Syria and others killing Iraqis off?  Certainly.  Iraqis are killing each other off.  Those of us with a brain predicted all that years ago.  Now it has come to pass.  Gee, golly, gosh, the obvious really was obvious.  We can't back up the clock.  We're there for the duration or we'll go back later.  Either way, there's gonna be a hell of a lot more body bags coming home.  The damage we did to our already abysmal reputation around the world may make it harder to do it again, but look at the polls. Listen to the neocons. We didn't learn in 'Nam (and I won't go into how that came about because we double-crossed our allies Ho Chi Minh and the Viet Mihn and the Vietnamese people but the historical record is clear on that one, too). We didn't learn in Iran. We didn't learn in Indonesia. We didn't learn in Zaire. We didn't learn in Cambodia. We didn't learn in Guatemala, Haiti, Cuba, Argentina or Chile. We didn't learn in Afghanistan. We're not learning in Iraq. Stay tuned, who's next?|`|KWhKwgsSaa	You need to do some more homework on this topic.  Al Qaeda has been around for many years -- even before the attack on the United State on 9/11/2001.  They had training camps in Sudan and Afghanistan.    Osama Bin Laden and the Taliban created the terrorists in Iraq, the United States and the UK.  And, yes, the UN did approve the war.  President Bush spoke before them numerous times before war was initiated.    I support the war, I support the troops and I support keeping that defenseless country safe from opposers who surround her such as Iran.    Although I am very saddened every time I hear about our troops dying, or innocent Iraqi citizens, I surely do not feel guilty.  And I pray every minute of every day that God will guide our world leaders to determine an effective way to equip the Iraqi people so they can defend themselves and our troops can come home -- including my son.    God Bless.    EDIT:  in response to your additional information, you have a wonderful resource right at your fingertips -- it's called the Internet.

No, the terrorist existed there before as Saddam had terrorist training cmps.    "there was no such thing as Al Qaeda before it."    False. Al Qaeda was founded in the late 1980s. And captured documents show that Saddam was talking to and meeting with Al Qaeda reps.    "There was no UN resolution which approved of this war"    Close. There is United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441    Besides which we do not need any resolution from the UN to go to waer. The UN has no say in whether or not we can go to war. Clinton sent troops to Bosnia without UN approval.     "and much more innocent people are dying for no good reason at all."    Not because of us, but because of the terrorists.

It sounds selfish but I would rather have the UK and the US destroy Iraq than have all these terrorists attack our country.   It's not because I live here but the United States helps and refuges more nations, and Iraq never did anything for other nations except hate and of course, we cannot afford to be  have destroyed and attacked any longer.   The 911 attack destroyed us. It was not only "death and destruction" but a global crisis, because it affected our economy and I can assure you that attack has a lot of things to do with the current state of the economy.   Iraq itself was destroyed before the war, like you said it yourself, it was being dictaded by Hussein and he killed many way before the US and UK got there. Hussein was part of creating those suicide bombers and along with innocent and destruction, went many who were raised to hate the US, simply because we have been more succesful than the country that hate us.  So, the war has put a stop to terrorism to a certain degree. And therefore, I do not feel guilty of supporting it. Would you rather have them attack us, like they did on September 11? If they destroy the US, they destroy the world. Just take a look at how many nations were affected by the stock market drops... The US is the heart of the earth.

For the first time he's starting to slip in the polls. Barack Obama is starting to slip in the polls. Don't worry. He's got a plan. He's going to be to campaigning in Europe." --David Letterman    "The big story today, Barack Obama was accused of insulting Sarah Palin when he criticized Republican policies by saying, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig. Political experts say that if Obama keeps insulting Palin, he could lose the election and win a job at MSNBC." --Conan O'Brien  |`|3tNTOtc4aa	The best political joke was when McCain picked Sarah Palin as his running mate.  I'm not complaining though because it's going to get Barack Obama to the White House.    Come senators, congressmen  Please heed the call  Don't stand in the doorway  Don't block up the hall  For he that gets hurt  Will be he who has stalled  There's a battle outside  And it is ragin'.  It'll soon shake your windows  And rattle your walls  For the times they are a-changin'|`|YcyDvJ6jaa	---> McCain|`|llrDNG09aa	A catholic, a Jew and Obama were on a boat, obama said this joke isnt going to work, im not muslim. 
C4EGYiazaa	No, the TALIBAN and al Qaeda wants Barack HUSSEIN Osama to win...they can't wait to attack our country and take it over!!|`|rwIedbB3aa	Well if they wanted t attack America they'd want Obama to win, because he won't fight back he's just a big softie when it comes to war.|`|0s09peMQaa	yah they'll ask for a source|`|5a9f3ea3f94dbbb691d97b0ed2f0bb00aa	yes but don't try and tell the cons....|`|48335e69585c5cf0917818a34e4b8aeaaa	i just saw that as well on cnn...|`|dA4gShdVaa	That what is reported...but I have to wonder WHY they would even announce this.  I think it's odd.  Maybe I am reading too much into it.  Afterall, McCain has no plans on pulling out.|`|BqEzJXEjaa	Obviously the Taliban and Al Qaeda think reverse psychology still works.|`|sJjTLX5Qaa	Just think, Bush/McCain cut and run from Al Qaeda.  Why wouldn't they want McCain?
PRsEdZyLaa	hey just a mention about che, he tried liberating several countries in south america and quite a few worked, and he helped depost baptista who for some reason americans think was a great guy, lol|`|VUuRjZbuaa	Nope, no surprise at all.     -Kei|`|Souvww0maa	hang their heads in shame?  And this is coming from someone who uses a radical Marxist murder for an icon...    You, sir or madam, should hang your head in shame.|`|qScVhUUsaa	Nothing is ever black and white with Fox news.|`|3K7ffKn2aa	Nope they have to face the truth eventually.|`|aBObYbpCaa	No suprise and they have no shame. Truth is an alien word to all Murdoch owned media, he disgusts me.|`|hyqf7xR0aa	Uhm...     it's funny how the Dems think Fox favors the Reps and the Reps feel that Fox favors the Dems    also, you have a picture of a butcher, a murderer, as your avatar|`|YHPYg7pWaa	No!It is no surprise at all!|`|kIE9TxvWaa	No, in fact I'm surprised that Fox noise doesn't have McCain ahead by 22 points.  lol...f'n retards.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	any how, they accepted that obama is leading. the word fox in that news channel tells what its nature, cunningness.|`|G3vJ5eflaa	Actually, you and your news channels and regular tv news should be ashamed of themselves. They have FAILED us in digging into Obama as much as they have both McCain and Palin. Oh yeah, if Palin were a Democrat you would be fawning over her. What a bunch of two faced liars. Your people have issues with their polls also. I take polls with a grain of salt. You gotta look at them all. Your "friends" who report the news have shown their true colors- they are all communists just like obama.|`|lxHCQA48aa	Yes. I'm surprised they're even showing him in the lead. You'd expect them to show McCain thirty points ahead. |`|AA11859735	After the last election....nothing about the conduct of Fox News would surprise me.     |`|493qTfviaa	Maybe your personal attacks on Joe the plumber ,for letting Obama speck his mind or Attacking Palin's family have not worked What do you know of shame?

LMgUpEgjaa	Yes, and from what I have read he has been trying to distance himself from her since she has gone "rogue". I can not imagine what the GOP was thinking when they chose Palin. Anyone would have been more articulate and intelligent than Palin.  Palin has been the best thing that has happened for our side though, and the Dems are very grateful.    Obama 2008 Biden|`|9mBvAKPXaa	No, he lies awake at night planning on how to advance America and prosper Americans.|`|kvacz3RFaa	i think he gets a ***** and cindy strokes it.|`|n5x2b3Foaa	Are you a communist?|`|AA11760898	no but he lies awake thinking omg i know i cant win so why did i ever enter????/|`|qqp8WtsAaa	If he hadn't made Sarah his running mate, he wouldn't have gotten the base of his own party. so 1 don't think  lie awake at night and regret allow Sarah Palin  be his running mate|`|AA10222223	Maybe he should.    Pain won over the religious right for McCain, but she lost him a lot of moderates.  Not a fair trade, in my opinion.    (I will be voting Libertarian this year, thanks to Palin)|`|J0aGfzTsaa	I don't think so.  I think he probably knows the vast majority of Republican voters would vote for Scooby Doo if he was running on a Republican ticket and told everyone he was a pro-life pro-gun Christian.  Just because she's a moron doesn't people won't vote for her and she might actually pull in a few more votes because she's a milf.  The entire World knew that George W Bush was the village idiot and an obvious puppet for the real players but people still voted for him.|`|35ZJauLkaa	Your listening to, to much media. McCain likes Palin and so does most of the country. It's the pinheads on the left that are scared of her. have a nice day |`|wVik8Fo7aa	The blame game is already starting inside the McCain camp.  Of course, when advisers starting pointing fingers at the Palin debacle, they ultimately have to point the the responsible party who selected her--John McCain.  Yes, McCain most certainly rues the day that he pandered to the right and thought he could garner the disappointed Clinton supporters, since his tactics completely backfired.  Current polls reflect that Palin's favorable numbers have drastically declined and that almost 60% of voters finally realize she is unfit for the VP office, much less a possible president.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	From what I've been able to gather, the inner core still like her and support her.  It's some others brought in who have had to prepare her on issues and for interviews and debates that have gotten frustrated with her.  This was from David Gergen, who is the most objective commentator I've ever seen, and he has worked for both parties in the White House.|`|0bca92964b851ca1b2f27db7faf7f57baa	Sarah Palin is NOT his downfall--only in the minds of liberals she is. Sara energized the base and drew in packed crowds at all her speaking engagements. If anything, McCain's downfall will be his inability to separate himself from Bush among the Obama kool-aid drinkers.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	No I don't think so. He probably forgets, you know old age. Any way it's better for his health if he doesn't become president. |`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	If he hadn't made Sarah his running mate, he wouldn't have gotten the base of his own party.  She was the narrow-minded, overly religious, bigoted incompetent, Everywoman that they were looking for.  So he wouldn't even have had the vote that he got.  I don't think he ever would have gotten the independent vote, he switched over to the right once he got the nomination and we have all had enough of that bunch.    The only thing I fear about Palin is the idea of her negotiating across a table from Putin.  That scares the pants off me.|`|9480b47d53181b325473487c60b671daaa	He probably does. But I think he is actually going to be relieved when it is all over and she is back in Alaska and he is back in the senate.|`|3iITqf6Uaa	I think he regrets the day he decided to enter the race.|`|AA11607017	  I think there's probably quite a few men who lie awake at night thinking about Sarah Palin.|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Not at all. |`|CUVYxMF1aa	If you go by the smear tactics from the left, it's obvious she was a good choice.  They fear her.|`|xIowgWL7aa	He might not now, but once the election is over, I am sure he will probably admit at some point that maybe he made a small mistake (Republicans never admit to making mistakes even when the evidence is right under their noses),|`|3iRKsC3Yaa	LOL
7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	Of course it's time to end the imperialistic embargo.    The embargo is only hurting the innocent people of Cuba.|`|1sZDsm86aa	John McCunt will only make it worse, Obama seems to want to sit down and talk to everyone which is better than killing everyone before talking.    |`|MDFqos60aa	It is long overdue. |`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	he should not only lift embargo on Cuba but also release Cuban 5 wrongly kept in us prisons.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	I have faith in Obama to end the embargo. No doubt there will be people from the right calling him a communist for doing it. |`|OPzH4ih0aa	It's long past time we ended it. It should have ended under the Clinton Administration. What I don't understand is why we think Cuba is so horrible because they're Communist. We think the same thing about Russia rebuilding their economy. Yet we hold no grudges or punches when it comes to doing business with China. They're every bit as communist as Russia and Cuba. China has a much longer track record of violating human rights than Russia and Cuba. The same is true about Vietnam! Oh, but that's different because we can outsource manufacturing jobs overseas so they can be performed by little children in sweatshops. That way CEO's of large corporations can make profits and American consumers can buy products for a cheaper price. I think Obama is far more likely to improve the situation than McCain. I don't think any of the Republicans care about Cuba because there's no money to be made off of it. Plus, there's no oil in Cuba.
OPzH4ih0aa	Of course, but they don't consider it that because he's helping out the rich and because he's a Republican who found Jesus. Only when a Democrat does it is it considered socialist. If a Republican does it, it's considered good business.|`|40ed361ed7df354988fb96506fac28e3aa	You shouldn't worry about socialism , there  are other  matters which are  far more  important and pressing.  The  so called  bank  bail out  is  to try and stabilise  the  economy  if the  bail out fails  then the s  t will  hit the    fan in  great big dollops and everyone  wil  get covered  ..  |`|d372ae1fdb80011057b9bb0385a63cd5aa	Like Chavez said "Welcome Comrad Bush !!!"|`|95wOEBLdaa	exactly, its socialism for the wealthy but THATS ok|`|6hPMnEyWaa	I would not bail them out. I did not vote bush. did not vote for Obama. but Obama and his handler Pelosi want to bail out the big three auto makers. and yes the reason i did not vote Obama is because of marxist communist ways|`|IPmMANRAaa	No, because the so-called bail-out is preserving corporate capitalism and not placing it into the hands of the citizens/workers.    Please read wikipedia so that you have a working idea of what said political ideologies are.    I hope you're a troll just looking to get responses from the mis-informed above and then laugh about it.    The people in the USA are so uneducated that its really sad. Tragic. A nation of such enormous wealth and equally great willful ignorance.|`|1Jnq33aUaa	Hang on, don't forget Congress. Pelosi and company are begging Bush to allow another bailout for the auto industry.    The biggest mistake government did was to bail out businesses. More and more businesses now want to be bailed out. For the sake of capitalism, learn to say no.|`|MIROMbMAaa	I was going to attack you but after thinking it over Why Your just a kid playing games Me be a communist to day Me wear Che t=shirt Me not able to amount to anything so me be a rebel Have fun kid Thanks for all the interest you have in my great country sorry about yours     Go put some dryer lint on you chin and an extra pair of socks in you pants Walk around saying I'm a rebel Y'all so cute when you try and act like a man  But sadly you have two things holding you back your nationality and you,Ho did I just tell you what to do Than do it|`|PRsEdZyLaa	wow i forgot about that with the election going on if people call obama a commie/marxist/soci they must also call the bush admin that too, cause are not obamas plans of 'marxism' also for the greater good of the people.    also because no one is saying it must mean his followers ae more accepting of other people and understand what people are doing for them.    and ray your funny    also quackie aren't  bailouts the same as nationalizations they both use tax payers money, so unless the owners get to keep it which is quite wrong cause how would people get there money back like in nationalization(not sure how tho)|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	To answer your question, yes it is socialism is that is why many of the Republican congress refused to voted for it.    We do not want this nation to become socialist. We've seen socialism in Europe and it sucks!    |`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If you haven't seen us say it, you haven't been paying attention.  Or maybe you would have needed to be here the week the bill was pushed through.  We've moved on, since we do not expect the Dems in Congress to ever go after the real culprits (themselves).|`|03ef1467aed1253e530bac3b2891149caa	Dubya took socialistic decisions but politicians love double standards|`|Audmf5JCaa	Would you say anything? These people have mouths to feed. It's not like being on the campaign trail pays a boatload of money. There was a news story about this a while back. Most politicians already have a lot of money. The people who don't have money act like GIAMBRA (look it up), the county exec from NYstate.
55q8s8aAaa	She's not smart enough|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Nope, just a lousy moose hunter..|`|WaaFCtuOaa	No but maybe she can go back to Alaska & be a flute player|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Maybe. She's hot but not very bright! Maybe she can be the new MILF supermodel of the year.|`|nAlyuyaDaa	I think she'll go back to pursuing politics in Alaska, where she probably should have stayed to begin with.  She killed McCain's campaign.|`|KgY4X4ccaa	She pushed that "hockey mom" meme so much, and very soon that is exactly what she will be.  Just another hockey mom.|`|u23sBafTaa	 Why don't you just leave her alone ! Go back to you're cave or whatever!
lxHCQA48aa	Brilliantly put. Best question I've seen on here for a very long time. Yes I will and I'm so glad you've mentioned Martin Luther King. That's exactly what I will think about when I wake up tomorrow (i'm a brit) and here Obama is president. The "I have a dream" speech is one of the most moving and powerful speeches aver and everytime I listen it gives me chills down the back of my neck. The tears wil be of joy and in rememberance of what black and poor people have suffered in the US and around the world. Come on Obama, the world is waiting.|`|AA11463514	You dare quote Martin Luther King a man who believed in character and you vote for a man who doesn't have any (Rev Wright, William Ayers, Rashid Khalidi, Louis Farakhaan?). What a joke. IF he wins, one must accept it in a democracy. Even if it means the destruction of the American way of life as we know it. Goodbye freedom, hello socialism.|`|T8MwDcI1aa	I'll probably be asleep cos its all kinda middle of the night over here & ive got a busy day tomorrow!   But i'll find out tomorrow! Its pretty interesting stuff to live through! :)|`|b3b6658e9bc43cc2cb202f0a76ae093caa	Yes and you should too and by the way Obama is JUST a dark-skinned man which he got from his "muslim"father and his mother was "WHITE" and believe or not not ALL white people were born with "silver spoons" in their mouths and struggle every day to live also and you can't blame what happened 100 years ago on white people because everyone can make a choice on which road they take   and quit using the "race" card because of your "OWN" failures in life !Some of us have to struggle more in life than other people do ! RICH&POOR people come in "ALL" different colors!USAF MOM!!!|`|4eaad6a567061722003ccb0606251d45aa	Yes I will. Tears of pure joy. Can't add to As you have said everything.

It was all fraud...|`|BRyRtQSvaa	No becasuse I don't cry, I will howeve, shake my head at the stupidty of people and laugh at the crap you stated!|`|sB5fbE8saa	You know, whites were slaves too. There are more white people on welfare than there are blacks. Blacks enslaved blacks. Blacks were not the only slaves, just the loudest.

We must organize to counter and neutralize these threats. This is a great time for all Americans  people and we must ensure that peace prevails, |`|ib2BLbDTaa	I will cry tears of Joy!  You know, I'm not black but I'm proud that my country has changed so much that they've put race behind them and nominated someone because of what they had to offer.  It makes me even more proud to be an American!  I voted for him, not because of his race but because of his stance on the issues.  That was what was important to me.

Race, race, race. You claim to be against racism, yet you go on about race all the time. If this was a truly equal society, the left would not mention Obama's race. You are belittling him by doing so - reducing him to a colour in the EXACT same way that small minded racist rednecks do. Your attitude is pathetic. I don't care what anyone says - slavery is irrelevent in a modern society. Your attitude spreads division, and is all to common in modern society.    And how dare you mention Martin Luther King? He was a great man - a man that in spite of all the hatred he faced, never retaliated in the same way. Not many people could do that. He wanted equality. He wouldn't want millions of blacks voting for a candidate for his skin colour. Can't you see the flaws in your logic? I have always thought that King was too optimistic, and that the full extent of his dream would never come to be. Nevertheless, he did great things, although I fear that this just shows that it will never be a truly equal society.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I won't cry. I'll be shouting and cheering and jumping off the walls.

Z5QL6THYaa	Hopeless.  These bots.  They are in denial.  This is just getting ridiculous.  It's like when Bush lied about Iraq.  It was so obvious that he lied, but everybody believed him.  The media acted as cheerleaders.  A few people who criticized Bush were branded as unpatriotic.  Now this Obama is the same.  Pure snake oil.  Still enough people suck it.  Anybody touches him is a racist.  Chickens will come home to roost alright.|`|IM30PoPNaa	I expect he will be a great President.  I expect he will lead from the center.

They always end up hurting everyone, except themselves.  They will always keep the poor poor.  They just give enough to make them think they are better off, just to get their votes.
2qQPBDlkaa	don't confuse yourself.. Democrats would like them helped NOW....    the democratic party leaders have no intentions of helping anyone other then themselves.  |`|kJM65nXJaa	Start looking for it around January 23, 2009. Now say President of the United States Barack Obama.|`|DibFrwxlaa	According to all anti-welfare posters here, we've been giving the poor billions.  We just can't take enough of your hard earned tax dollars and hand them out to some undeserving drug addict.    You are the essence of a partisan hack if you think the bailout bill lays squarely on Pelosi's shoulders.  The Treasury Secretary, Fed Chairman and President all wanted it passed.  In fact, the President got on tv and pleaded for it to be passed.|`|dQcPV4Rqaa	I don't exactly understand your question? What are you asking? Do you think that by Pelosi not taking a vacation, that will give Americans more gas money?????? The question makes no sense....    Just exactly what is it you want the Democrats to do??? Suggestion please....It will take a long time to even begin to fix this mess....|`|BREf9KOwaa	In about two weeks.|`|OOeh2vEWaa	January 20th.

Is she not aloud to take any vacations.  You do know that conservative republicans voted for the bail out bill too.  The same ones that ran on and got elected b/c of their conservative principles.    Could they have just been saying that stuff?|`|MQBcpUsXaa	Pelosi just donated a million dollars to the person fighting Michelle Bachmann in MN for the congressional seat.    Nice to know these libs have so much money to sling around for campaigns but don't help out the poor.  Look at Obama/Bidens tax returns as compared to McCain/Palins.  It's a WORLD of difference in percentage of income donated.    They want to take money from the wealthy and hand it out to the lazy too.  If we trust them with our money, they'll probably just use it to illegally fund their campaigns and buy votes through welfare handouts.|`|ca866ce419e17f58cd9673fde5feac8faa	the new deal is a quagmire....  we need to redeploy    but taking your 401k and taxing you for it as the Dems are now planning to do seems like it is where they are continuing.    http://www.workforce.com/section/00/arti...|`|94067f0094ecabf35aa20a2ef3c6e10daa	as soon as the poor can afford the universal health care plan|`|eOwPWu4maa	It's just there way of hauling in the poor vote.    In actuality, increasing taxes on the rich, corporations, and businesses, so the government can increase spending on social programs makes their plight worse. It keeps them dependant on government handouts, and hurts the economy by increasing unemployment and the costs of goods and services the poor can already barely afford.|`|masYIMRWaa	Democrats are notorious for giving away money, they are big spenders...There will be lots of money (from taxes) to give away via Welfare ...free money, come and get it.  |`|xX4Eu5K8aa	You really want Bush for 40 more years?|`|NvOro0igaa	1. Reverse the trend of giving corporations tax breaks to off shore US jobs.     2. Require taxes to be paid based on the amount of US wealth you own (upper 5% of earners)    3. end the $70 Billion/week war in Iraq (they want us out anyway).    4. Lead an industrial and technical advancement in renewable energy, freeing up about $100billion/year of wages NOT spent on fossil fuels.    5. Invest in education (we spend less than $8/year on ALL education in this nation) Compare that to Iraq war spending.    Shall I go on?   |`|8f0AJY8gaa	They plan on keeping them poor like they have the last 50 years that way they can blame the cons in 4 years and still get the poor vote.    It is the same old same old for the democratic party.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	They will make more money and increase the debt which makes no sense big business is all ready sending out pink slips to their workers they are getting ready for Obama.

bNuzSg1Oaa	I've dealt with British, Canadian, and American customs agents recently, and they have all been very nice and helpful.|`|1amF7oNwaa	Maybe because they are paid to.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	     Maybe it is a job requirement ?     I am sorry your not rude enough --- perhaps there are openings in baggage  |`|966e591e0a8b096ea3291985162ce64eaa	I find custom agents to be very friendly. |`|3w1NPZlzaa	Because they are in low level jobs but they are given total authority over a person for a short period of time. These aren't people who might have gone on to be doctors and teachers. They're people who I like to file under the category of "barely conscious". I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you put a dumb*** in authority over someone else then it's not going to be pretty.|`|3tNTOtc4aa	Because put a uniform on them and they turn into fascists.  These people were probably the school bullies of their day and now they have a chance to wield a tiny bit of power they think they're Adolf Hitler.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Give the little Hitlers an ounce of power and they run over you with a mack truck.    |`|me9C3z67aa	Consider what they deal with every single day. Every second they have to explain the same thing to the same type of people. I think a time comes where they just disconnect with themselves and don't care anymore.|`|XuYPddLuaa	Because they come in contact with so many rude people. So it rubs off. Also, in the airline industry, you got immigrants coming, right? People who don't speak/understand the language. They probably get frustrated. I'm guessing, really. Hopefully, you'll get a primary source. + Most of them are probably married so don't care how they come across to the public.    I don't travel much but most are nice to me :D |`|Mf1hUW3haa	I have no answer why but they seem to follow along the same attituded exhibited by most Department of Motor Vehicle workers as well.     Really, what is going to happen to them if you complain?  They are federal employees and if you confront them about thier attitude it is you who will be delayed....for a very long time and more than likely a cpl days.   I had an incident with a customs agent at the Minneapolis Airport were I had come from an international flight, I got a little lost and as I was walkingoward the exit the ageant actually verbally insulted me by telling me I needed to get new glasses.  He did not tell me this in a joking manner.   Long story short it took me about 3 hours longer to leave and me telling the ageant he needed to have his supervisor respond.  I voiced my complaint with the the supervisor and I was on my way.  |`|1Fq25obNaa	They figure "why be nice? It is not required and I will never see this person again".
AA10667433	She subscribes to the Unitary Theory, the same as Dick Cheney, which seeks to imbue the office of the VP more rights than the Constitution gives it.  I was scared enough by the prospect of McCain dropping dead and leaving Palin in charge.  But now we see that even if he survives his term, she has every intention of usurping the power of that office and will view herself as a Co-President.  I for one will not stand for it.     This is one of many statements Palin has made that convinces me she must have failed her American History class.  Here's another:    In 2006, the conservative interest group The Eagle Forum sent a questionnaire to several Gubernatorial candidates with a series of questions, including this one:     Are you offended by the phrase Under God in the Pledge of Allegiance? Why or why not?    Sarah Palins answer: Not on your life. If it was good enough for the founding fathers, its good enough for me and Ill fight in defense of our Pledge of Allegiance.    http://eagleforumalaska.blogspot.com/200...|`|6hPMnEyWaa	VP is in charge by being the tie breaking vote if there is one|`|BIFGBlGqaa	Sarah is not too sharp. |`|AeQAzsQ7aa	She has been asked this question by various medias at least 3 times & she has "expanded " the job all 3 times.

If0vYA1qaa	Nazi Pelosi is an @ss and doesn't care about us. maybe she's getting money from groups that don't want drilling. Follow the money trail!    We need to get rid of ALL of Congress. Barney Frank, and others, should be in prison!|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	Her radical conservationist friends don't want the USA to use energy.|`|IWqiY0ASaa	Probably because her hole is too big and if she allows drilling then it would produce a horrible smell from her butt-butt:)|`|C2HHfun2aa	YES!!!! |`|6JQUIZFTaa	They are left wing radicals and are probably getting paybacks.  They have lined their pockets in the past this way.    Yes, I think Pelosi, Reid, Dodd, Frank and Obama all need to answer questions.  Some may need to go to jail, especially as they have created this financial bailout crisis.|`|muAEP3bGaa	Pelosi is blocking drilling and natural gas because it doesn't fit their worldview and ideology.  They want to provide minor tax credits for wind farms and solar, while Dubai and other areas will overtake our once great nation (sadly).    And you're right: Dodd and (at a minimum) Barney Frank need to go to Prison but, sadly, the majority of their constituents are so dumb they will not fire them (makes me wonder if they'd still stick with Frank even if he causes the next Great Depression, which is a possibility).|`|hpBFDAaGaa	Pelosi is a complete nutcase.

BANANA - Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone.  Yep! That about does it...|`|NvOro0igaa	maybe she listened to the chief oil execs in the country when they were telling us that all the drilling in the US would only contribute 1% of our oil needs.    Or maybe she just thinks we should drill the reserves that are already leased for that reason first.    Or maybe she is listening to that other oil exec, TBone Pickens who is telling us that we cannot drill our way out of this energy crisis.    Drilling off shore is just a cheap diversionary tactic practiced by a few who have much to gain financially.  Do the research, check with geologist, scientists, reputable economists and you will find that you are being sold a very, very big bill of goods. 
AA11206283	The state attorney general, Jerry Brown, has said those marriages will remain valid, although legal challenges are possible.  |`|qJiWYTVRaa	Idk, but even though I don't live in California, I was very happy with the results. No offense. That's just my opinion.|`|108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	Still to be determined.   Jerry Brown has indicated they would be upheld because they occurred before the law was enacted via the election.  However, Pro Prop 8 organizers said they would push it from a legal angle as the "intent" of the Prop 8 argument was that ALL marriages should be between a man and woman, not solely the ones from November 5th forward.      That said, legal scholars are on the fence.  There is no precedent to work from, but some speculate that it would be difficult to retroactively apply the law, and if they did so, it would heighten claims higher level court claims of discrimination and civil rights violations.
sQsl1r5Yaa	Equally important.  Pastor Martin Niem?ller expressed the importance of standing up for the rights of others:    "When the Nazis came for the communists,  I remained silent;  I was not a communist.   When they locked up the social democrats,  I remained silent;  I was not a social democrat.    When they came for the trade unionists,  I did not speak out;  I was not a trade unionist.    When they came for the Jews,  I remained silent;  I was not a Jew.    When they came for me,  there was no one left to speak out."|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	I'm not sure what you mean by "group rights"...do you mean as an example the right for gay people to marry?  I'd say if we take care of individual rights (such as the right to marry any adult of your choosing), then the group rights will be taken care of.  Think about it, you can marry someone in prison, or someone you met on the streets of Las Vegas 5 minutes ago, but committed partners can't marry?  We need to get our priorities straight.|`|mggll8dRaa	My Own Rights First, Within A Group...!!|`|Lljkj0EFaa	Individual.  We all have to deal with our own personal responsibility.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Both  because they are not mutually exclusive. If all individuals have rights, then the society by definition has group rights.

For example, if the 2nd Amendment secures individual rights to weapons ownership, it is more difficult to take them away from people than if it only secures the right for militias.  Militias can much more easily be government regulated and still ban weapons for the 'disapproved' classes.|`|X4xdLXKaaa	Individual rights.|`|pElG2K61aa	Individual rights, which is why our Constitution was set up to "protect the minority from the tyranny of the majority" -Bush appointee Federal Judge John E.

He felt Article Six did not go far enough in separating religion and government.|`|WsqlA3owaa	I think the best answer would be in reading the crap on this program.

JXek7ceVaa	My opinion right?   The difference between a uneducated  and educated racist that I can point out would be that the educated one can use bigger words to describe his or her hate and maybe have access or contacts more readily available for him or her.   Where as the uneducated racist would in fact use profanity and rude gestures to get his or her point across.  And probably use weapons, contra ban to prove their point.  So my answer would be NO!   Because hate is hate whether you have a degree or not!  I pray that racism would be no more.  We are one being, we are one race and that is the human race.  |`|kBWpp0qqaa	yes and no  depends on what lvl you speak of(level theoretically and morally, not like a lesser human or a video game lol).  Of course because the person is racist they are on the same level of ignorance I suppose. In that manner they are the same.  But they can differ in views of racism, like standpoints and reasons because of their education. This would then make a difference between uneducated and educated racism. This is especially important because one could say an uneducated racist, although not stupid, is less understanding of his standpoints and therefore does not fully understand his reasoning.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Yes, the educated one knows when to keep their mouth shut. So they won't  get jumped by some redneck or ghetto person. While the uneducated one is going to be on the 6 o'clock news. |`|YzWkNRFZaa	i am an educated racist|`|AA10531094	Nope, because any racist is ignorant.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	No. It is still the judgement of a person based on skin color. If any other factor is considered, then it would not be racism.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	I would have to say very yes to this. An uneducated racist would be more prone to using violence as expression of their racism, while an educated racist would not (generally speaking). |`|mggll8dRaa	The Educated One Should Know Better...!!|`|9PAavWnyaa	A racist is a racist,  a racist, and a racist.|`|AfaFCiKxaa	There's a difference in their education level, but not in their offensiveness.

A person can be uneducated or very educated and still remain ignorant.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	No. A racist is still a racist no matter how much he is educated, or not.    I stand corrected by Jelliebene.|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Yes.

Non-sequitor.|`|Zda2jYhVaa	No, because a racist would be ignorant and uncaring for blacks.|`|OtI4tviYaa	I don't think so! I am educated and I wouldn't say I'm a "racist" but some types of people really annoy me, and some uneducated people feel the same way.    It does seem that most really racist people are uneducated, but not always.     Note: Bill Gates is probably not racist, but he is "uneducated" as he is a college dropout, so you can't really base much on education. I've met some VERY educated people who are very stupid, and met many normal people who are very smart, so education does not matter in my opinion.    People are racist because they are, not because they read or do not read certain books and pass tests!|`|RuPxMfmjaa	Yes. Most intelligent people who are less than tolerant tend to have a degree of understanding and don't seem to indulge their beliefs with quite the same glee and righteous indignation that the less than educated seem to enjoy displaying.|`|tMncsMXoaa	Yes. The educated racist understand the statistics and the implicit human nature that leads to racism. The uneducated racist goes mostly off of negative experience with the race in question. Racism is not intolerance. These are completely different issues. The true ignorance is the repeated confusion of the two. Everybody is racist. I encourage you all to take Harvard's implicit tests to teach you a little more about yourselves. Until then, you should all stop preaching.|`|UHIi8AuQaa	yes i do think there is a difference,but either way both are wrong..|`|SqVUUSKqaa	No!    You can be the most eloquent, astute person there is but any racist argument boils down to unbridled prejudice.    By casting aspersions on an ENTIRE race of people you are simply relying on stereotypes.    Any racially motivated argument falls at the first hurdle as there are very few universal truths when it comes to individuals.    It may be a cliche but every race of people has its good and its bad negating the validity of any racist argument.|`|KeDuKdgCaa	Yes... the educated racist is a myth.    Education is good way to ensure that you let go of stereotypes and ignorance.    The type of "education" that these self-proclaimed racists have - always falls outside the realm of "peer-reviewed" or "ivy league"... In short, they got a degree from the educational equivalent of "National Enquirer Magazine".|`|46d77d6cd34d97452bc6bc41f6b9892daa	No there aren't.

iVv6bFW2aa	No because the friendship might be a good one. It would be intolerant to reject such friends, but we would have to respect each other ad not argue constantly about our differences. Friendships with people holding other views can also be a learning and growth experience.|`|AA11613264	whats up with all these "How do you feel questions?"|`|kq6sdjXuaa	it would probably be touchy...right now is a touchy time but no.|`|e3av6sY0aa	Yes.

I just had a nice dinner with a couple of them last night.    My sister tried to convert me to become an O-bots like her.  We are still close.  It's funny to me that she is so passionate.  Some of my feminist friends are like that too.  I teased them sometimes, and they would get mad.  But we are still friends.|`|mUMMLjDdaa	no, of course not.|`|AA12240654	No. That is petty.    They can choose to support whoever they want. It is not that serious.    |`|vqUVWPBAaa	No, I think it is foolish fo loose a friendship over an election. Politicians say horrible things about each other and then next thing you know they are having dinner with each other. Remember all the terrible things Bush said about McCain in 2000 and then McCain turned around and campaigned for him in 2000 and 2004. Look at Obama and Hillary nowadays.  What is worse than voting for the opposition in my opinion is to not exercise your right to vote at all. I know it sounds silly, but for women and blacks the right to vote were hard fought battles. |`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	No, one of my best-friend is a McCain supporter.  We just agree to disagree.  |`|AEoXHUPEaa	Depends if they try to convert me or not. Thats annoying.|`|cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	Strangely enough, I'm a Republican and I've experienced this.

I thought they were supposed to be so open minded...|`|cWfpkzGQaa	No. I have many friends who support Obama.|`|KeDuKdgCaa	Of course not... I have a few Republican friends...    I just had to set some boundaries and let them know that they can't send me all those FWD: emails about how Obama is supposedly a Muslim terrorist...

My very best friend is my polar opposite politically... we just don't talk politics anymore... but we still greatly love eachother.|`|keN8vwCQaa	I've lost two friends because I am not voting for Obama. These are people I've been friends with for 12 years. One of them I helped get into her first house, helped her move and lent her money when she got in trouble financially.     It's bizzare to me that these two liberal friends of mine are not as open minded as they claim to be. I guess tolerance to them is only for those who agree with them.|`|JJAodx30aa	my question consists of you civic duties as an American to   ANSWER MY QUESTION!!|`|IDcIww7Baa	Nope. |`|ECkj80cUaa	Not if we we friends before the topic came up.  I have two very close friends that are voting incorrectly in my opinion.  One, I have stimulating debates about it with, we haven't changed each others minds on anything- but its fun.  The other gets her political information from internet spam and is so ill informed I CAN"T discuss it with her.  But, other than that flaw- I love her.    I would probably not foster a new friendship with someone that I was polar opposite of politically.  |`|SZJ7kpyJaa	It depends on the reason.

Voting is not that hard to do, and it's what decides who will be in the most important political office in the World.|`|byjAYzllaa	Because I want my voice to be heard. Because I can. Because it is my patriotic duty. Because I want what's best for the country and that means voting for the best candidate.|`|AkO0QUwqaa	Please, those of you who are undecided: Consider that Obama endorses partial birth abortion, among other abominations. If you have any fear of God or respect for innocent human life you will vote for McCain. Obama is not Godly man, he is not Martin Luther King Jr.. He is anti-God, anti-Christianity, anti-military, and hence, he is Anti-America! Even so, he would never admit it. He will help to persecute the church in America. I pray God will have mercy on the Obama's. We wish them no harm, but we certainly hope they will not be running our beloved country. And we will be voting for McCain/Palin. Don't let liberal media tell you who to vote for. Protect innocent life and vote for McCain!|`|qoVIG4m1aa	Because it is my right, privilege, honor and duty to cast my vote for the candidate I think would be the best leader of our country. I am doing so to the best of my ability and if I don't I have no right to complain if my candidate does not win. Which God Bless Us if He doesn't...   McCain/Palin 2008. Amen..Amen.. and Amen...

Just look at the FDA they poison us with excitotoxins (MSG, Aspartame), drown us in high fructose corn syrup, constantly shove milk (known carcinogen) ads down our throats, and just when it couldn't get any worse they sneak GMO into our food supply. Damn bastards are paired up with Monsanto...|`|mggll8dRaa	Sure Enough...!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, not  the last few Republican governments, especially not Dubya's.

Although it doesn't not appear so at the time, it is only an indication that they have been able to hid it more efficiently than some third world countries but with the financial crisis happening, it is finally coming to light.  More will be exposed later.      This entire capitalistic idea of cheat the other guy and pass the savings on to your best friend is a sign of corruption to me.  It may be legal but it is unfair and corrupt.|`|AA11367901	No, and I never will.
3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Nope,     Obama stopped saying 16 months, as soon as he won the Democratic nomination.    he then shifted right and now says, it will be based on what the Commanders on the ground think should be done.    Basicly he will follow the Bush plan, which is by the end of 2010.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	Perhaps.  First things first: we need to define our goals.  Do you know what our goals are?  What we hope to achieve?    -Partition Iraq into 3 countries, Sunni, Shia and Kurd?  -Democratically elected government (Shia are a clear majority - so is Iran, lots of luck with that)  -A return of the Baathist party we kicked out  -A random choice.    After we define what we are willing to live with we can work to achieving it.|`|AA11209831	No.    It didn't matter who won, the troops will be there for longer than 16 months.    This will be yet another broken promise.|`|bf4757f4f354855ce33fb48482a8ccb5aa	No.    I don't think he is THAT stupid, just talks big.|`|mggll8dRaa	Probably Not...!!|`|00B394HBaa	If Colin Powell advises him to...|`|MD6IsKN0aa	That's the stated time table I believe.

In '04 about 6 million Blacks voted and split about 70/30.    This election 14 million voted and the split was 95/5.  That is just over the exact margin he won the popular vote by.    All this BS about him energizing the youth and new voters is just that.  The numbers of young and new were nearly identical to the Bush/Kerry election.  |`|9c0JAYP9aa	Great organization.

7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	The current tax system was written by the rich, and benefits the rich.    Warren Buffet pays less taxes than most of us do....since he can write off so much.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Yes it s .      For example, the GOP takes $95 billion a year (2006) from TAXPAYERS  and gives it to corporations like Exxon.  That's redistributing the wealth big time.    McCain whats to take taxpayer money andgive it to the insurance companies---and is trying to hide the redistribution of wealth by calling it "tax credits--for 37 million people who don't have health insurance. Taht's $185 BILLION. PER  YEAR.    At least Obama wants to use our tax money to help ordinary Americans--not take  hard-earned money from the middle class and hand it over to large corporations.    OBAMA 2008|`|dBwLflHfaa	no the current tax system is based on releaving the rich and large corporations of as many taxes as possible and forcing the poor and middle class to fund the unpopular war in Iraq. |`|eD1ODTeSaa	Many of our tax dollars are used for the infrastructure of this country.  This includes uses for things like roads, grants for technology research, sewers, flood management, etc.  A major portion goes to the military.  Only a small portion goes for welfare systems.  Obama stressed that he will tax more for the sole purpose of giving to people who are poor.    I know Warren Buffet, as a whole, pays a very large tax burden.  As a %, he pays less.  I feel that ALL of us pay a large tax burden. I make 6 figures, and pay my share.  I get upset with the waste of our money.  If the govenment spends less, there would be more money for welfare benefits and to help the country as a whole.
ACYsfUxvaa	Uh....I believe that the majority of America voted for Obama because they believe that Obama would be good president , several wing states clearly said that. But because Obama is the first black elected candidate, his winning is also historical.    If there was, is or will be a good and potential candidate for the top job in Australia ( prime minister ) who knows how to run a country and he/she happens to be asian/aboriginal/african/hispanic/middle... descent, then I would happily support him/her. I think Joh Howard was good but then he was gradually getting out of touch , and our current PM Kevin Rudd is fareing pretty well , he is a great , hardworking labor.    I kinda know what u meant but as long as we have a good leader, why should we care about the skin color ?|`|e0cbb3a5a37710eea752dfdefe4bd63faa	I've always kind of laughed when people brand America as "the most racist country"....Have you ever been to America? Jeez, with all of the diversity and conflicting groups it is amazing the country just does not break out into a hundred million separate fist fights. Plus, racism in America is more superficial than it is in, say, Europe. Attitudes and prejudices change rather quickly. Weirdly enough that is why it works. Because, lets be honest, America will have multiple minority presidents before, say, the UK ever has even one PM who is a minority.    So, were does the real racism lie?|`|xE3OtGRVaa	No, only HOPEFUL that if there's one day a candidate for the job of Prime Minister in Australia that their race won't affect their chances of success if they're the best person for the job.|`|BoU8r7Zsaa	I think it is good.

You listening PA?  That man is going to bankrupt you!!  |`|BzSB07TCaa	hurt|`|NrKj9KgPaa	    >> United Mine Workers of America (UMWA) International President Cecil E. Roberts issued the following statement:    "Sen. John McCain and his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin, have once again demonstrated that they are willing to say anything and do anything to win this election. Their latest twisting of the truth is about coal and some comments Sen. Obama made last January about the future use of coal in America.    Here what the McCain campaign left out of Sen. Obamas actual words: But this notion of no coal, I think, is an illusion. Because the fact of the matter is, is that right now we are getting a lot of our energy from coal. And China is building a coal-powered plant once a week. So what we have to do then is figure out how can we use coal without emitting greenhouse gases and carbon. And how can we sequester that carbon and capture it.'    Sen. Obama has been consistent with that message not just in the coalfields, but everywhere else he goes as well. Despite what the McCain campaign and some far right-wing blogs would have Americans believe, Sen. Obama has been and remains a tremendous supporter of coal and the future of coal.    I noted that Sen. McCain even went so far yesterday as to say he has always been a supporter of coal. I wonder, then, how he can justify his statement at a Senate hearing in 2000 that, In a perfect world we would like to transition away from coal entirely, and his leading role in sponsoring legislation in 2003 that would have wiped out 78 percent of all coal production in America?    Fortunately, UMWA members, their families and their friends and neighbors in the coalfields know all too well what is going on here. Theyre not going to fall for it, and we urge others throughout America who care about coal to review what the candidates records on coal actually are. We are confident that once they do, and once they see the many other benefits to working families of voting for Sen. Obama, they will make the right choice for themselves and their families."   http://www.wsaz.com/political/headlines/...     |`|W62gfpdbaa	Could you reference that Plan?

Yet their hatred toward and fear of a united and informed Citizenry will drive them to the task of keeping us separate, highly emotional and illogical where any thought of the elections lay.     So, yes, your cartoon-frame is probably not far off.     ...|`|x3S96oU7aa	I believe they have done that already.|`|6JQUIZFTaa	No, just for the truth like they are now|`|94d08dd717a03c8ee47a4127c2cc1e9aaa	Among the mainstream media Fox is the only one which gets close to the truth.  Obama and the democrat machine will totally wreck this country.  |`|juG7X5gyaa	The stock market is falling because people are taking their money out of this country anticipating an Obama win.   As the market goes, so goes the country. Basic economics.    Get a clue.|`|k1jwNKbgaa	The Media will not blame Obama for anything, are kidding me?  They'll paint a picture of him being this wonderful gift from God.
ePhGra7Maa	Rush Limbaugh. He is the most hateful thing this side of Fox News. Can't listen.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, there is a hate radio station in New York City. The talker is Bob Grant, an anry right wing rxtremist on the order of Rush Limbaugh.|`|VDgLVHtGaa	Yes, all the far-right neo nazis in my city.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	San Francisco still has some left-wing talk radio, but we have the righties too.|`|TFTusZK1aa	yes npr broadcasts everywhere|`|31edb7797d765f1300c12d8242a8f21caa	I am a little sick of the hate and extreme bias on CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, PBS, and MSNBC myself. I guess it all depends on whose ox is getting gored.|`|9PAavWnyaa	No. There are four stations that carry Rush Limbaugh, Glen Beck, Michael Savage, Sean Hannity, Michael Medved, Bill O'Reilly, Lars Larson, and a few others, but no hate talk radio, just good, ol' plain common sense radio. Some people hate the truth and that's why some radio talk shows are labeled as "hate." The people I know who don't want to listen to the radio simply turn it off, or tune in another station. A simple twist of the wrist will do it.
4IOPe5ziaa	She does not know the job of VP.  A ninth grade civics student could have given a better answer to that question from a third grader than Palin.|`|EuOjlonAaa	ha she is a dumbass when the oldie dies the pitbull with lipstick will be pres.|`|9qmP77Rgaa	yesssss  she knows way more than biden who is a complete turd|`|HQrpDBO6aa	By Kimberley Strassel    And now, America, we introduce the Great Obama! The world's most gifted political magician! A thing of wonder. A thing of awe. Just watch him defy politics, economics, even gravity! (And hold your applause until the end, please.)  To kick off our show tonight, Mr. Obama will give 95% of American working families a tax cut, even though 40% of Americans today don't pay income taxes! How can our star enact such mathemagic? How can he "cut" zero?      Abracadabra! It's called a "refundable tax credit." It involves the federal government taking money from those who do pay taxes, and writing checks to those who don't. Yes, yes, in the real world this is known as "welfare," but please try not to ruin the show.     For his next trick, the Great Obama will jumpstart the economy, and he'll do it by raising taxes on the very businesses that are today adrift in a financial tsunami! That will include all those among the top 1% of taxpayers who are in fact small-business owners, and the nation's biggest employers who currently pay some of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world. Mr. Obama will, with a flick of his fingers, show them how to create more jobs with less money. It's simple, really. He has a wand.     Next up, Mr. Obama will re-regulate the economy, with no ill effects whatsoever! You may have heard that for the past 40 years most politicians believed deregulation was good for the U.S. economy. You might have even heard that much of today's financial mess tracks to loose money policy, or Fannie and Freddie excesses. Our magician will show the fault was instead with our failure to clamp down on innovation and risk-taking, and will fix this with new, all-encompassing rules. Presto!     Did someone in the audience just shout "Sarbanes Oxley?" Usher, can you remove that man? Thank you. Mr. Obama will now demonstrate how he gives Americans the "choice" of a "voluntary" government health plan, designed in such a way as to crowd out the private market and eliminate all other choice! Don't worry people: You won't have to join, until you do. Mr. Obama will follow this with a demonstration of how his plan will differ from our failing Medicare program. Oops, sorry, folks. The Great Obama just reminded me it is time for an intermission. Maybe we'll get to that marvel later.     We're back now. And just watch the Great Obama perform a feat never yet managed in all history. He will create that enormous new government health program, spend billions to transform our energy economy, provide financial assistance to former Soviet satellites, invest in infrastructure, increase education spending, provide job training assistance, and give 95% of Americans a tax (ahem) cut -- all without raising the deficit a single penny!      And he'll do it in the middle of a financial crisis. And with falling tax revenues! Voila!     Moving along to a little ventriloquism. Study his mouth carefully, folks: It looks like he's saying "I'll stop the special interests," when in fact the words coming out are "Welcome to Washington, friends!" Wind and solar companies, ethanol makers, tort lawyers, unions, community organizers -- all are welcome to feed at the public trough and to request special favors. From now on "special interests" will only refer to universally despised, if utterly crucial, economic players. Say, oil companies.      Hocus Pocus!     And for tonight's finale, the Great Obama will uphold America's "moral" obligation to "stop genocide" by abandoning Iraq! While teleported to the region, he will simultaneously convince Iranian leaders to peacefully abandon their nuclear pursuits (even as he does not sit down with them), fix Afghanistan with a strategy that does not resemble the Iraqi surge, and (drumroll!) pull Osama bin Laden out of his hat!     Tada!     You can clap now. (Applause. Cheers.) We'd like to thank a few people in the audience. Namely, Republican presidential nominee John McCain, who has so admirably restrained himself from running up on stage to debunk any of these illusions and spoil everyone's fun.     We know he's in a bit of a box, having initially blamed today's financial crisis on corporate "greed," and thus made it that much harder to call for a corporate tax cut, or warn against excessive regulation. Still, there were some pretty big openings up here this evening, and he let them alone! We'd also like to thank Mr. McCain for keeping all the focus on himself these past weeks. It has helped the Great Obama to just get on with the show.     As for that show, we'd love to invite you all back for next week's performance, when the Great Obama will thrill with new, amazing exploits. He will respect your Second Amendment rights even as he regulates firearms! He will renegotiate Nafta, even as he supports |`|OG4WF1PJaa	She may know up from down. That would be about it.    It ceased to matter quite some time ago.|`|oTmc3kMUaa	She wants to be queen. And why should she let the job description stop her.     And if its not going to stop her, why should read it , or the constitution ??? Especially if Todd gets his way, and Alaska violently breaks away from the union.     You betcha !|`|412f673354a42041faf908ccbc558571aa	You betcha. Didn't she lie like a trooper or abused her power like a VP ? Wait till she's President.|`|EFn7bNwwaa	no|`|wuzLTh8caa	I don't think she does,  this is a quote from McCain from an unnamed source.    "If by chance I cant finish my term as president, this airline stewardess will take my place,"    Enough said.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, she doesn't even know which side is up. I am sure she is unfamiliar with the constitution, or pretends she doesn't know. That's because the Constitution limits the VP, to chairing the Senate or taking over the presidency when the President is incapacitated or dead. She wants to rewrite the job description to give the VP much greater power. This is similar to what Bush/Chaney did to expand the executive power and blur the differences between the other powers. i.e.Legislative and Judicial. If elected she would be like Cheney, and very dangerous. But it isn't happening because Biden will be the next VP.|`|AA11777322	She knows how to lie and she also knows how to abuse her power and most importantly she knows how to bash other people and hurt her running mate.  |`|eiGUOeleaa	Actually she was right... go back to government class, the job of the VP is to be in charge of the senate..    In vito veritas, why don't you get an education before you insult someone else, yes, the VICE PRESIDENT, serves as PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, which gets no vote (enless there is a tie, which is really the only time 1 vote matters)    so they aren't really "in charge".. but i don't really think she was far off  \\|`|r6dJTGQKaa	No.    She is ignorant of the responsibilities of the job (and proved it not one...but 3...times in interviews), as she is ignorant of so much in the US and the world.    edit: waffleco, please read the Constitution...at least once.  A VP breaks a tie in the Senate, and that is all that position does as that body is concerned.|`|5iNIUtO5aa	a better question is did obama settle for biden, because bin laden would have been too obvious. |`|KsvfjbAAaa	maby lol   |`|vEzeOt6Taa	You will know when she is elected to the job on November 4th!!!    Clinton backer to McCain/Palin 08!!!
2XIsvCzNaa	Absolutely NOT !!!!!|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	Yes, I suppose.  If you deny W his somebody will want to deny Slick his pension.|`|Nk7wU6Hoaa	That's a matter of federal law.  Thankfully, you and your ilk have positively zero to say about it.|`|CUVYxMF1aa	What - for keeping your sorry selves from being blown to smithereens; or for improving the economy until the dems took over the house two years ago?    If  Clinton and Carter could get a pension, then GWB should.|`|HZy629kLaa	Yes, he was president.    Doesn't mean I want to pay it.|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	Did you know that Che was a mass murderer just like Ted Bundy, David Berkowitz, and Jeffrey Dahmer.|`|AA10158192	Why shouldn't he.  He's worked for it.  Besides, don't you realize that the House & Senate have been predominately Democratic?  Why aren't they getting the blame?|`|5COJmUOWaa	Absolutely not, Fellow Traveler.  He deserves to be in a cage.|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	Shouldn't pensions be based on performance???  ABSOLUTELY.     But Bush will get a pension paid for by you TAX PAYERS   He gets secret service protection for the rest of his life paid for by the TAX PAYERS  He also gets a presidential library when he can wrote as many lies as he chooses, and this is paid for by the TAXPAYERS.|`|1amF7oNwaa	They gave one to Jimmy Carter|`|V7JVKApkaa	TOY|`|YFlGfj6daa	He deserves a Presidential prison.|`|Rwn0svq0aa	He got it. Exxon Mobile best record profits ever to the tune of $14.6 billion.  He is paying his fair share back for his service as U.S. President by signing the $760 billion bailout to the financial industries. This far exceeds his pension. So when Bush begins to draw down his Presidential pension on paper he will not be breaking even, he will be in the red, because the national debt per person will be so huge after the next 8 years of any President to follow, the cost per person will far exceed his pension, like most Americans.  So, this President got the ball rollin.  Good thing George Bush is not an enemy of the State, like Bin Laden. We would really be screwed.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If I was an Obama supporter I would want to shut you up.  Better watch your back.    
eulkgK0Daa	fox news! lol|`|ECPdAeHQaa	Ha-ha funny    Fox News definitely :)|`|HOTDwmEoaa	It depends whether you're more entertained by talent or by watching and listening to slapstick with bumbling, blustering oafs.|`|AA11702773	Comedy Central.    They are watchable.    Fox business news is ok sometimes though.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	Stewart and Colbert are more funny and more truthful.    Glen Beck is semi-truthful;  he's one of the better mainstream pundits, but not great.    O'Reilly and Hannity are just propagandists.|`|2XIsvCzNaa	Well Hannity is surely a big joke, lol.|`|0440336faf3bbaada17aec78b1b564b2aa	Comedy Central.  The Faux Spews attempt at comedy lasted for all of two shows.  Just how funny is Ann Coulter?|`|yYYXVCGZaa	well, there really is no one on comedy central who can top alan colmes on the laugh-o-meter that's for sure...|`|8cd4e5f44ddf57a92d759bab9b6186d1aa	Funny the commedy chanel couldn't think of aa single plumber joke to tie in to Joe the Plubmer and Obama. Like Joe the Plumber flushed Obama's tax plan. Obama's campaign is going down the drain.    I guess it's selective comedy where only Republicans are mocked.|`|Lq4306a5aa	Between Brit Hume and John Stewart? I don't think Brit knows how much of a goof he looks like.

I do remember that about twenty years ago racing driver Rick Mears was heavily fined in Alaska for flying in to a place and otherwise legally killing a bear without spending a night in the area.|`|zgugU4Gtaa	my brother lived in Alaska for years.  thought gut shooting Moose and making them crawl to truck was funny.  |`|YczLYtWjaa	educating yourself on an issue before posting a question about it might be a good thing for you to do.......you are only making yourself look foolish as you know nothing about the issue........and i am not your comrade|`|p77H5bXnaa	No.    I'm not convinced she did.    Did you know game officials do this very thing to thin herds if they aren't sufficently thinned during hunting season. This is done in most states.    Yeah I didn't think she did this. I checked.|`|t81pdsUPaa	What is morally wrong about killing a predatory animal that threatens the lives of humans? They're not hunting rabbits from above. They're just thinning the herd!|`|AA10232063	You spew so much hateful rhetoric about Sarah Palen I think you have a deep thing for her and it is really causing a problem between your liberal side and your human side.|`|EsC14bgNaa	i could hardly visualize Sarah Palin hunting  much less from a helicopter,|`|zu39ryGEaa	...no..only if you cant see russia from front door...|`|dv9PAwDnaa	Don't you think it's morally wrong to support killing innocent babies?  How is it that so many people care more about animals than the pure, helpless, innocent baby.  I don't think women who have abortions should be punished by any means but I do think abortion has higher moral importance than shooting animals.  If you think hunters should be punished what do you think about those who choose abortion?    |`|VWIggGYvaa	Im with Joe on this one, Education is a beautiful thing.. All I can do is laugh man!!|`|J74Y5LKxaa	To answer your question, no.  Now be honest........until a few months ago, you had no clue who Sarah Palin was.  Did you? |`|c9adce326b761303adb12127ff5dabd0aa	For the purpose of population control and with the required permits, yes. If they can legally hunt in the State otherwise.
JYtcTBt9aa	Her Down-Syndrome baby would be better!|`|hHbEabPqaa	No. McCain was smart picking Palin.  He has over 20% of women votes|`|AA11657693	probably|`|9a49974f63463535e46a56621d8c22f1aa	hes not smarter than a pimple on Sarah Palin's nose. |`|cnSew7jiaa	lol heck yes anything is better|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	NO.|`|T7WlMHrZaa	By a million times. |`|qmjJswzkaa	In my wildest dreams I never could have imagined that Dan Quayle could be a better choice than any living thing, other than an amoeba.....until Palin.|`|IoYZBmVIaa	niether, how about mini mouse?|`|AA11193401	yes|`|AA10047279	Yes|`|ylimD1yYaa	Dan Quayle WAS a VP choice and the ticket got elected.  |`|IsrmpNNBaa	Tina faye would make a better vp than Palin george bush would too, omg she is such a dumb azz|`|0tMXL1bMaa	He was certainly better than Biden - at least the word he misspelled was six letters long (potato).    Not four (jobs).    heh|`|CW8ah4Wgaa	Larry the Cable guy would have been a better choice than Palin. |`|3eea4704cf8414e46d6ef6d3729ba82baa	Yes, also.  One thing I'm going to miss after McCain's defeat is the opportunity the media would have had to make fun of Palin.  They'd have  had so much fun with Palin/McCain for the next 4 years.|`|BxHO8MQraa	Equal incompetence. Equal with the goofs.|`|BKmon5cmaa	a sack of potatos > Palin.|`|1fitU8yraa	Sheet i think a nice fern would have been better. |`|p77H5bXnaa	Maybe. I heard him speak once. Dan is actually a pretty smart guy.
TPVVuGk5aa	He already was the symbol of the Republican party in my mind.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	I'm going to nominate Sponge Bob Square Pants for the symbol of the Democratic Party.  |`|bOaqWNxRaa	I happen to know Jabba the Hut personally, and he is a gravely misunderstood gentleman. He's actually very intelligent, and is a hoot to hang out with. He even babysits my kids sometimes.     Take that, liberal media!!!!!!!! - HOMER SIMPSON|`|BsQcplTQaa	Only if you could have Darth Vader as the new symbol of the Democratic party.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	no, the democrats have a jackass. what does that tell you comrade?|`|0zkNjyRyaa	Hey, Che how's hell and are you looking forward to seeing your buddy Obama there some day?|`|MiB5fhePaa	I recommend C. Montgomery Burns.|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	Or this    http://hikinghq.net/images/failure.jpg    Liberal Asskicker:  Che hated Stalin|`|9cpKYneZaa	I thought Mao and the cultural revolution fell out of disfavor in the late 70's. Kinda like Che, Fidel and soon to be Hugo.    Therefore, no Jabba the Hut would not become the new symbol of the Republican Party. But the big, red star will become the new symbol of the Democratic party.|`|twdXT5wOaa	Yes.  I thought about Sauron as maybe more appropriate, but that would imply a misused intelligence - so Jabba the Hut it must be!|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	I would say being that Democrats are so big on government programs that take care of those who don't want to work and like to punish those who do. Don't you think Jabba the hut which represents a big fat government and laziness better represent the Democratic party ? |`|hSZDVKF3aa	Jabba couldn't speak much english. Has to be a dem symbol.|`|l7B2ZiVHaa	I think Larry Craig or Mark Foley.  They hate gay people but... Or should that be butt.  Hey, wait a minute.

Then you should watch the powerful speech in Team America about ***** and a**holes. Then you will know who to vote for.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Judging from your avatar, Stalin should be the new mascot of the democrats.    Most of you look up to him anyway, right?|`|YYbVDcw8aa	Maybe "Q" from Startrek could replace the Donkey?  What's the "Che" picture about?  A Jim FitzPatrick fan or anti Castro? 
WZXboi4Xaa	yeah. MSNBS rocks!|`|3uH441n3aa	Obviously you have a 2 digit IQ|`|KcAehrrKaa	He would demolish America if he could and Fox News.|`|fFrdimDBaa	Surely you jest? MSNBC is nothing but one sided.

Moi aussi.  |`|2AqU4SjYaa	I think Fox News is great !    Did you know they have more viewer than CNN and MSNBC combined?    Cool, huh ?    "Fair & Balanced"    Fox is great, . . . especially Sean Hannity and Bill O'Reily    Dan in Miami|`|EqPoodXfaa	Che Guevara would watch MSNBC, they think along the same lines.|`|hSZDVKF3aa	  Maybe you can't understand both sides of an issue. So stay with  msnbc, you only get one side there.|`|0a4pzJVyaa	MSNBC? you have got to be kidding...I'm guessing  a realible source is Obberman.|`|FcTxF0D7aa	To speak of a great man like Goebbels in such a deragotory manner is dispicable...and your obsession with Fox News just shows how intellectually devoid the lieberal leftist communist PC brigades truly are since they cannot rely upon their own stances, alone.|`|cadb1mATaa	i like the propoganda on cnn,msnbc,etc      hey move to china commie|`|IVjspiStaa	Dear Comrade of course NBC CBS CNN NPR are all right, let's go ...lets vote for al franken also...there is NO PLACE for FOX NEWS in a society with free speech right?  Let's throw everyone that does not follow the obama rules off the plane...just so we can have a one party system...wake up.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	There is no "unbiased news," and that's a well known fact.

No, not time for a revolution....|`|HHuS48u5aa	I'm not your Comrad you commie. I'm a Pub and of course we are going to win.    revolution, no get your butt to work. No freebies this time.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	Friend of my brothers went to an Obama rally and asked Obama what his favorite Beatles song was. He told the crowd "Let It Be". When Obama was leaving, he leaned into my brothers friend and said," Actually, more like "Revolution"..............TRUE STORY! Listen to the words! The guy is a freak!|`|ndhCIggWaa	Don't count the chicks if it is not hatch yet! Chances are McCAin will win the Presidency since your Obama's shady past might play a role to his lost!  It was just uncovered that his aunt living illegally in Boston who even got a Public Housing!  How did she get the public housing if no one helps her?  I just don't buy it , that Obama doesn't know about his aunt Zaituni (who by the way was mentioned in his book) living there in Boston Illegally! It is no brainer to think that they were traveling together with Michelle year 2002!    By the way I always believe that most of Democrats if not drug addicts, they are alcoholic , love to receive hand-outs or criminals (low life) . And you might be one of those mentioned because you are planning a revolution!  Desperate  Democrats!  |`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	No. It is treason to rebel against against a properly elected government. |`|IVjspiStaa	McCain/Palin will win skippy.|`|gKvznKpKaa	YES SIGN ME UP|`|09xtMfRraa	Knock yourself out.    But I have to remind you that us bourgeois Republicans are firm believers in the Second Amendment, not to mention our fondness for military service.    It would be an interesting rebellion, in a shooting fish in a barrel sort of way.    Best to stick with the election process my friend.|`|AA12178676	Yes..  But they need a miracle and some fraud to make that happen.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	Fortunately, the libs have been advocating against the 2nd amendment, so it will have to be a revolution of knives and forks.  |`|Jjyl4YBsaa	LOLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL...
YIWKPXokaa	I am sure the IRS is watching his every move since he owes them money.    How much do you want to bet we will hear about him for tax evasion with in the next 2 years.|`|8qkJIun5aa	i think people who falsely claim to be vets should be punished.....|`|SPuhM2Avaa	Rewarded.|`|ci4m7YSNaa	Well it would be nice if he had been told he owed taxes...he is on record saying he didn't know.  And as for not being licensed, you don't need a license in Ohio unless you own the business.  He is 5 or 6 months away from being licensed if you are interested.  AND WHY DOES JOE MATTER TO YOU?!?  All he did was ask a question of the candidate and he became the symbol of someone McCain is trying to help...hard working people who strive to do well, and maybe even own their own business someday!  OBAMA DID THE SAME THING WITH HIS INFOMERCIAL, and I don't see you criticizing Obama or the people in the infomercial like you've been mercilessly going after Joe!  You guys on the left really need to look yourselves in the mirror.  You've gone off the deep end.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	If all tax deadbeats were severely punished, half of the House would be in jail right now.    I think it's a gross abuse of power that someone even investigated him at all. A private citizen should have the right to make a statement without being terrorized by those who don't agree. The people who started investigating him just when they disagreed with him should be fired for abusing their positions.    Obama isn't your friend either. He doesn't even know you.    **But you haven't, have you? Nope...didn't think so. Just remember, it starts with Joe today; it'll be Che tomorrow.**    *On the other hand, if you DID know him, that would explain the "Comrade" thing, wouldn't it?*|`|ebenYCxeaa	Severely punished.    Allah is great. Praise Allah!  Get on your knees and praise your O-B-A-M-A!!|`|504de3b674744374659943caab7074c3aa	"Comrades"? And people like you are the ones who get upset that McCain says "my friends". No, I don't think he should be punished because, if the government was not taking taxes from us, most of us would have the money we needs to do the things we have to. The forced taxation on a lot of people only perpetuates their need for government assistance. It is the government's way of inducing dependence.|`|182UIiCwaa	Dumb question half the high ranking Democrats in office owe back taxes ERRRRR.      Get informed    Don't listen to the main stream media you just sound ignorant like most of today's journalists|`|HueBNFjOaa	The licensed plumber who is Joe's boss thinks enough of Joe's work to have put his license on the line for Joe for 5 years. That says a lot about Joe's skills as a plumber. Plumbers decide whether or not to join the Pumber's Union. The union, as much as they would like to, does not decide who is and isn't a plumber. One way to become a plumber is to go through the union's apprentice program. Another way is OJT. Joe only owes $1,000 on his taxes. Many people owe a lot more than that. Don't worry about the IRS.

She has a voice that isn't perfect. Is your voice perfect for speaking on TV or to huge crowds?  She never misses a beat though, is so physically and mentally fit and a mother of many children!  How many of these attributes do you have?  I think she is amazing.  I am very disappointed that the media makes her look so pathetic, because she isn't.  Women who do not realize what a phenomenon Palin is, are more pathetic.  Do you want that "glass ceiling"? Does it keep you feeling safe?      I want out.  Sarah's leading the way!|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	She just makes women look bad, period.|`|AA10265144	She's a threat to Democratic women that's for sure.

She makes herself look worse than us.|`|k2Jbp9e6aa	The personality, if not the good looks, of Sarah Palin, are what most people are used to in women.

That's a far more important image, I think.|`|55I4L8yJaa	I don't think she changes the face of powerful women, but she makes herself look silly.|`|ylimD1yYaa	That actually would be sexist (*gasp*) to suggest all women are as vapid as Sarah Palin.    |`|IeHwl9m2aa	i am not a women but woman is singular so wo-man  woooooooah! man,   therefore i am a woman? wow man?  yes i am man and you say wow so i can answer this question.  if you are a democrat she makes you look bad|`|nB6GLjWDaa	Nah.

Women who hate Palin do so only because of their petty jealousy.|`|FKqtAhjraa	Yes.  |`|pRbx4Y5Waa	She is making us look like total retards. She can't even answer a direct question.

The people must be judged as individuals, and not as groups.|`|MkwL6We1aa	I think all women politicians make women look bad    look at Hilary and how she screamed against Obama ?     and then turned around and had Obama and others pay off her     campaign debts..?? The Clintons are setting up Obama for a fall    I don't know much about Sarah Palin..and really you don't either    But I think she will come out of this ok..but I think women are held    at a disadvantage when running for office    The women may have had the vote given to them in 1920 but the    women as a whole are still behind in pay and in politics..and the    women contribute more then their share in MOST marriages    women do more then 50%..or is your spouse or Boy friend different?|`|83uhQ3kFaa	I think that she is a very smart woman, But it's very obvious that she is very crooked ,they have aired so much of her dirty laundry. I honestly would not feel comfortable with her as VP . Sorry Sarah:( |`|GzqtZ9fuaa	Not as much as Hillary Clinton. And besides, most women do look bad next to a sexy lady like Sarah.|`|Q2sBa006aa	She is just making herself look bad, and McCain for choosing her, but certainly not all women.  From now on, they are changing the name of throwing a "Hail Mary" to throwing a "Sarah Palin."  |`|fdUOke8Laa	i say hilary clinton makes democrats and blonde's look bad|`|kK2oqsiXaa	She's a mixed message. Her record i n Alaska for shaking up the establishment, renegotiating with oil companies and returning money to constituents is probably just what every female associate vice president wants to see out there even if they are hard core liberals. However, leaving an elected top position for an appointed one that has greater prestige but no responsibility is a serious drawback and then not ever being prepared for it is another problem. If we only look at her a female role model for "women in power" I think most them will see her a negative role model because she made some bad choices and then didn't adapt to them. If we ask ourselves, is she more prepared today to be VP or President since the Katie Couric softball interviews the answer is no.   |`|b0aedc9dd7e866ac9503c3e962e4170baa	I don't think she's making women in power look bad at all....she's just making herself look bad and comes across as a big joke|`|NNeWuVTRaa	I saw a comic a while back (xkcd I think) with two versions of the same situation.

mPLXUorTaa	He wouldn't have much to go on.  McCain is mostly popular for the simple facts that he's a republican and a lot of people won't vote outside their preferred party and that a lot of people hate or are scared of Obama.|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	His dyspepsia and cracked teeth from all that anger.............|`|wVik8Fo7aa	His new best friend, Joe the Plumber.|`|AEoXHUPEaa	He would chant USA USA USA over and over again..|`|Z7mhIuEEaa	His favorite brand of diapers and black licorice.|`|YIWKPXokaa	  He would talk about what a great choice Palin was.

When the Bush tax cuts expire, we're ALL getting a tax increase. A family making $75K annually is looking at $3K a year more in taxes.    If the "rich" are going to give a slice of their pie to the "poor" who so you think is going to foot the bill for Obama's massive gov't projects? YOu guessed it. Hang on to your wallet.    VOTERS BEWARE~|`|xOlRTabpaa	you are a fool if u think obama will lower taxes.    look at his voting record.|`|gUhvARDdaa	I can grantee you this. No matter who gets elected we all will be paying the same or more taxes...not less. Its all empty promises.|`|WIaaj5BIaa	Obama's "tax breaks" are in the form of tax credits, which is money back.  In his plan, 40% of American's get more money back than they pay in taxes. That is welfare. Example: John makes 20k and owes 1k in taxes. He gets a tax credit of 1.5k which results in the government sending him a check for $500.|`|AA11438707	It would seem that you do not know what a tax break is.  One can only get a break on their taxes when they pay taxes to begin with.  People who are not required to file a tax return or are entitled to a full refund of their taxes are not paying any income tax.  The "tax breaks" that the Messiah is claiming he will bring to the "middle class" will, in a lot of the cases, be in the form of refundable tax credits, which will be able to exceed ones actual tax liability.  Therefore, such people will likely be able to get a refund that exceeds the income taxes that were actually withheld from their pay.  This is not a tax break -- this is a handout.  It is the government picking and choosing who they want to hand out welfare to in the form of cash that must be paid for by those that actually have to pay the taxes.    If you get back all the taxes that were withheld from your pay as a refund, you end up not paying any taxes.  Just because you are filing a tax return does not make you a taxpayer.  Just consider yourself lucky that the tax system is as unfair as it is by punishing success and wealth and that you have such a low tax rate.  Is that hard to understand for Democrats (Socialists)?  I know it is hard to see anything out past your own hand which is outstretched hoping for the government to give you your free money.|`|PnlzE7oFaa	Because he isn't.  His own website showed a single mother of 2 making 40K would get $650 from his plan and $1050 from McCains.|`|Du0jOcaIaa	because i'm not a socialist. and i like job growth.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66z5TDrwP...

And come to think of it, you are also wrong concerning 2000.    As shown clearly in the RealClear Politics link below, Bush had a solid lead in the daily tracking poll averages throughout the months of September and October, 2004.  Kerry surged briefly just before the election, but he NEVER had a lead in the average of polls.    As for 2000:  Gore did in fact have a lead in the polls, and he did in fact win the popular vote.    But he lost about a month later, by a vote of 5 to 4.|`|A560oUeyaa	Sounds like a trend...|`|xkcLOfTKaa	Are they wrong? Or lying?  One study I read shows that some "exit polls" are means to sway undecided voters. The idea being that no one wants to throw away their vote on someone who can't win. So, if you call a winner in one part of the country before the polls are closed in another, you most likely prevent some people from even voting.    Just a thought!

I think each member of Congress should be allowed to put in a limited number, say ten, over their entire careers.  To keep track, they should be required to have a finger amputated for each one they tack onto a bill, which would also make sure they only did so for "really important" things.  Once they are out of fingers, no more riders.      |`|1U6XYrhGaa	Some projects are worth it.  Give each Congressmen 6 million dollars.

You could say the Black Supremacists voted for Obama to promote the Black race, so let's knock it off.

Republicans on the other hand never said this,  they said they do not want Socailism.  Why are you stupid?
L5l99wr7aa	No. Not really. |`|gwUMipsUaa	As tired as I am about people judging McCain.  Clinton wasn't blamed for Bush's failures.  The WTC was first attacked when Clinton was in office, and he barely batted an eyelash.  Are you old enough to remember when that happened?    Clinton was the one who had so many military bases closed and basically gave our military the finger.  He also sold us out by signing NAFTA, which started our jobs going overseas, sending the farmers down the river, etc.    Edit: I forgot to mention that Clinton paid the national debt and put us in the positive by bankrupting social security.  Yup, he gave little old ladies who were barely making it on SS the finger by cutting their checks and benefits.|`|AA12066574	I was judging him on his extreme left wing voting record.|`|FhKfyxWlaa	Wait a minute...McCain was blamed for Bush's failures, which is why he lost the election.

He has already said he can't get things done in his first term. What a creep.|`|hR1cZhJBaa	You took the words right out of my mouth!|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Its just bitter Neocons.

It is all okay though, just to carry on this way because for a minority to succeed in America, he must have cheated right? Well, that is what they think. Obama is going to have to defend himself for the rest of his candidacy for the rest of his time in office and I know he can do it.     |`|m72ZD6AJaa	You're question is one-sided, just like the election.    You'll notice if you read comments on other Obama related posts that people are already making him a miracle worker, claiming he's amazing and working hard for us...he hasn't done anything but work for himself so far, the election just finished yesterday, and he isn't officially President until he's sworn in in January.    In the meantime, I think people need to calm down and realize this "change" everyone wants isn't going to be immediate, because nothing important ever is.     And I will have to say that McCain was blamed for Bush's failures, and it was something he couldn't shake no matter how many times he or Palin called themselves "Rogues" or "Mavericks". |`|G49lKR56aa	To paraphrase a line that was used after kennedy was shot.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Conservatives should be happy to know that Obama's brand of "socialism" (as defined - incorrectly - by the Right as "spreading the wealth") has also been embraced by such conservative heroes as Teddy Roosevelt, Ronald Reagan, John McCain, AND Sarah Palin.    - Teddy Roosevelt (Republican) first introduced the progressive tax structure in 1916, whereby the highest earners paid a higher percentage income tax.  It has been part of our tax code EVER SINCE.    - Ronald Reagan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit (the single MOST wealth-redistributive policy in the history of our tax code); also, the highest tax bracket under Reagan was 50% - the highest bracket in Obamas proposed plan is 39.6%.    - John McCain has publicly supported the EXACT same type of tax policy that he is NOW calling "socialist."  See for yourself:     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kYsF1Mer...    - Sarah Palin imposed a windfall profits TAX on oil companies in Alaska, and cut a $1,200 check to every Alaskan with the proceeds.  If that's not "SPREADING THE WEALTH," I don't know what is.    So, let them call it whatever they want  socialism, Marxism, Buddhism.  It has worked for this country in the past, and it will work again.  |`|oaesvXtyaa	"During the debates Obama wanted to have a health care plan where people can opt put of it if they don't want it, while Hillary wanted to make it mandatory."     As long as the taxes I have to pay to support the system are mandatory, it's socialism.    Nobody said he was more socialist than Hillary.    We just said he was socialist.    The gap would be made up for from the general fund - i.e., income taxes, from all of us.       Hillary also said she wouldn't include illegals - - - who made up half of the ranks of the uninsured......  There AREN'T "42 million uninsured Americans" - three years ago it was 35 million and 7 million people haven't lost their jobs.   Five years ago it was 31 million.    And there are 20 million illegal immigrants, and many more millions of legal immigrants who don't have health insurance.    I guess what I also don't understand is "fighting the struggle to do something for those at the bottom" when it's such a fluid model - it's very easy to move up the economic ladder at least somewhat.   It's not difficult to go from janitor to barista or stockboy.  Those aren't dream jobs but they do generally pay health insurance if you work 32 hours a week.   If the people in SEIU spent half the time and effort they spend organizing to take an EFL course and put a resume together, they could improve their earnings by a lot more than whatever they're going to collectively bargain for as janitors.   Honestly, if you're a $7/hour janitor, would you rather be a $7.50/hour janitor with very limited benefits or a $8.50/hour stockboy or barista with health and dental and a week's vacation time?|`|y2TrNtzJaa	Duh, HiIlary wasn't in this race.

C7CaNLGlaa	Melamine was put in Chinese milk products to cover up the watering  down of the milk.  The melamine was to cover up the lack, or missing protein.     China also has a thing for lead and they put it in toys shipped to the US where our children can get lead poisoning.      China's businesses run like corrupt Third World nations unto themselves and making money is all that matters.  The only reason China arrested the people who put these poisons in their products was nothing more than a P.R. move.

He will not sign that bill until he is able to remove the offending language, or write a good bill of his own.      The homework never stops.

Second, when I fact-checked the GI bill thing, not surprisingly you left out a few important points: that the military brass didn't support it either because it was too expensive and it would have encouraged too many service members to leave the service early. This would have had a detrimental effect on military readiness. http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=...    As far as the Dream Act is concerned, he originally sponsored it (with Democrat Ted Kennedy and several others) because it would give illegal aliens the opportunity to gain citizenship legally while adding additional security measures to borders. It was originally designed to be a compromise between cutting off all opportunities for immigrants and locking our borders down totally. Once it went through the stops, so many amendments and pork were added that it was unrecognizable from the original document, so McCain had to turn it down.     Basically, the original bipartisan attempt to solve a problem came before a Democratic controlled Congress and just got weighed down by BS...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comprehensi...    Dig deeper AND report fully.    **I live on the border and there's just as many drug dealers and thugs trying to get in as hard working, desperately poor people looking for a better life.

b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	Bush is a pariah. Every Republican is staying as far away as possible.  That's his sad legacy.

EYOqHja1aa	yes, they should be. there are also lots of genetically modified products in n.a. not labelled. take corn and canola oil for instance all gmo'ed. the canadian government refused to pass a law to label gmo foods, saying it is voluntary. demand and buy more organically grown foods if possible|`|9hC7bbf7aa	It should be clearly printed on the label of the source, where the ingredients are originated, how they are processed. I'd contacted Beechnut requesting the origin of some baby products, where they were processed. And I've been given a precise info. All of theirs were made in USA, and ingredients came from many prats of the country. Websites help, but for me talking to a REAL person satisfied my inquiry. FDA 's regulatory, mandating period of printing by the food companies are very close, probably in another 6 mos or so. Every Co. has to comply  by FDA rule.|`|QI2OxkImaa	Yes I think so!!!|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes they should. Or they are all Ok and there's no problem to putting it openly on there or there is a problem and they shouldn't use those ingredients in the first place. Can't have it both ways.  Still consumers need to be careful. Even obligation to put all ingredients on the label usually means little without strong enforcement. Companies lie and cheat if there's no one checking their claims, multinationals even more.  Good example of this is fake cheese. Fake cheese is all around us and used in most cheese products, pizza, lasanga, a bunch of snacks we eat but it's never stated on the label as such because they can technically leave it out by naming the ingredients of the fake cheese separately even in countries where it's the law to put all ingredients on food|`|6YlAUiAhaa	yes

But there will be no more gay marriages in California (until prop 8 is overturned for being unconstitutional).|`|3YRrGfkiaa	No.  Those are still valid marriages.  The state cannot simply void marriage licenses that were legal when issued.  That would be an ex post facto law, and it's not constitutional.|`|7jugwxF6aa	yep|`|NKTJaHjYaa	ya thanks to Obama|`|xPNNKT2zaa	No it's not true.    However, it could still turn out that way.|`|DW4Q4jhNaa	Not in California. They are legal in California. Ha Ha|`|UPuTUVrRaa	I sure hope so.|`|9cTDSPPQaa	Assuming you're referring to prop. 8 in California, the answer is no.  All existing same sex marriages should remain legal, just no new ones.  Our constitution does not allow enforcement of newly created laws expost facto (after the fact), therefore the new law will not apply to those previous "Legal" marriages.|`|P9zMowzTaa	No. Those are valid marriages, the government gave them a marriage license. If it has already been signed and filed, the marriage is valid.    So the 18,000 gay couples who tied the knot will still be legally married.

The sad thing is, we didn't need monetary stimulus from the mid-1990s to 2004.   We'd made fundamental changes to economic policy like tax and tariff reductions and deregulation of energy and transportation that reduced barriers to capital investment and to trade, and as a result would have reduced real prices had the money supply not grown at such a rapid rate.       In the 1950s and 1960s we did need monetary stimulus because of the high tax and tariff rates as well as regulation - we found out in the 1970s that growing the economy via monetary inflation was unsustainable.       But this time (a) we should have known better than to create all these bubbles and (b) it was totally unnecessary.   We could have had reasonable, 3% growth rate on a perpetual basis without monetary stimulus.

In fact, ALL presidents are held accountable by a certain amount of the public for things which they have no control over at all.  |`|YupMCYHlaa	One of my reasons for voting for Obama is that historically, Democrats are held accountable by Republicans much more than vice versa.  Even with minorities in Congress, the Republicans kept Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton in line, kept them honest.  But even with (admittedly small) majorities in Congress, the Democrats weren't able to rein in the Bush administration. For the last few years they have been completely out of control.    At the very least, Obama is a Harvard professor of constitutional law.  At the very least, he will not flout the constitutional limits of the powers of his office.  |`|yuDyMGmaaa	No president ever admit they did wrong except Nixon who try to save from go to jail by resign the office.|`|bgtNYOp5aa	I hold Bush accountable for his actions so I don't know what you are talking about.

I never though Bush was competent enough to be President; Katrina proved me right.  After the 2004 elections I figured the country had given republicans enough rope to do themselves damage and just waited.    It is less about reputation and brand than it is ideology and trustworthiness.  Remember, Bush wanted to be a uniter not a divider.  Well, he divided plenty and the base was all too happy to be divided from the rest of the country.       They have also been ceding the intelligentsia to the dems for years and have paid for it.

But they also spat on the constitution, taking away our rights, spying on us, and locking up people who weren't even criminals.    The things bush said were infuriating. remember when he said "every nation, every country now has a decision to make. you're either with us. or you are with the terrorists"    that was spooky.

If Obama turns out to be as bad as I think he will be,in 4 years you will wish Obama had turned out to be as good as Carter was.And that's saying something,since the idiot Peanut Farmer nearly destroyed this Country.

"W" started leaning more towards liberal principles and McCain tried to get elected by crossing the center line. Unfortunately for him, the other lane was already fill by Obama. The party should embark on a path of clarifying their positions and COMMUNICATE them to the conservatives in this country. Many of us felt we didn't have a choice and stayed home (I voted as often as I could). The media and Democrats influenced the selection of McCain in the Republican primaries. The party should not allow non-Republicans to vote in their primaries. That would help the party select a candidate that truely reflects the party's platform and positions.

98a5c705254e76745e000a1bd7e067edaa	Government asks court to block wider testing for mad cow    By Sam Hananel, Associated Press Writer  WASHINGTON  The Bush administration on Friday urged a federal appeals court to stop meatpackers from testing all their animals for mad cow disease, but a skeptical judge questioned whether the government has that authority.    The government seeks to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed Kansas-based Creekstone Farms Premium Beef to conduct more comprehensive testing to satisfy demand from overseas customers in Japan and elsewhere.    Less than 1% of slaughtered cows are tested for the disease under Agriculture Department guidelines. The agency argues that widespread testing does not guarantee food safety and could result in a false positive that scares consumers.    "They want to create false assurances," Justice Department attorney Eric Flesig-Greene told a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.    But Creekstone attorney Russell Frye contended that the Agriculture Department's regulations covering the treatment of domestic animals contain no prohibition against an individual company testing for mad cow disease, because the test is conducted only after a cow is slaughtered. He said the agency has no authority to prevent companies from using the test to reassure customers.    The Feds did prevent them from testing all their Beef and that is what prompted the Korean protests.|`|ukFfdizOaa	I don't think most people know much about the world -- Iceland has completely collapsed and could be sign of what could come to rest of the world if the Banking industries don't get fixed -- yet if you watch our News you mostly get US politics and BS|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Yes I did.

You would think they would be more concerned about congress, since they blame EVERYTHING on the congress that was elected in 2006, even though Bushy  boy and Co. are the ones with the executive power and as such the real culprits. I think they are concerned about Obama simply because he's black, and that is a real departure from what they are accustomed to. I told a faithful republican friend of mine a few years ago that they would regret having gone so far to the extreme right in a few years, and now that time has come, and it's the absolute worst possible scenario for many of them- a black president! How come it was okay in 2004, when the reps controlled everything, but now that the dems may have that same kind of control, why is it no longer okay?|`|uOVsCWdNaa	I worry simply because there is a chance that congress will agree with some of his wild ideas and we will no longer have some of the things that make us Americans (right to have guns) and we will turn into socialist crap.

Two years ago we kept hearing how the American people didn't want one party to control both of those branches of government.

There may also be a senate super majority that will even prevent Republicans from making a fillibuster and at least forcing a debate on a bill before it is passed. It will be the first time since 1938 that one party has had that much power.    So there will be no checks and balances at all. Can you picture this country ruled by Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, and Obama.

People mock those of us who fear his impending power but they won't be laughing in a few years.    Most of us know McCain is not a great choice however, he is the better choice.

Why would anyone think the  country is in good enough shape to keep doing what has been done?  DO NOT think that Mccain will be different than Bush.  They are following the Republican Platform, so things will  only get worse, not better!|`|oaesvXtyaa	Except that the tax issue works to the GOP's advantage - tax REVENUE has gone UP, just not up as fast as the spending.    I agree with you about the concept of an inflation tax, but the spending has been bipartisan, including the bail out.  Oh by the way the Democrat-controlled Congress gave Bush his FISA reform.    As for the mortgage crisis, that's the Fed cutting rates too low after 9/11 and the inflated credit being diverted to unqualified borrowers - that was equal parts George Bush and Barney Frank.    And as for wedge issues.... what could be a bigger wedge issue than class warfare?  |`|LxdiTYE8aa	Intelligent people don't.    Friends do not let friends vote republican.|`|AA12092556	unless you haven't noticed, we sorta had a little "issue" going on in the Middle East.  do you think Bush expected any of that to happen?    besides, this whole sub-prime lending crisis?  ALL the fault of Democrats.  it can be traced back to Clinton, but it didn't really get noticed until the most recent two years.  the sad thing is we knew about it, but Congress wouldn't do anything because they're Democrats.      and maybe Republicans win because most of the people in this country LIKE them.  ever think of that?  you always try to blame it on "voter fraud" and all that crap, but the fact of the matter is this........  Bush won fair and square for two terms.     and if friends don't let friends vote Republican, you Democrats must be a very lonely bunch.|`|AA12241103	HATE !!!

If you remember correctly, there were a couple of "big" things going on.  And I would argue that they DID do something about illegal immigration and the Bush tax cuts.  There was a huge jump in spending, but again what was going on then?  Where are you getting the 40% number?  Or do you mean due to the increased debt there was a 40% increase in the amount we pay on that interest?    I really don't think the republicans have the corner on the market regarding the amount of truth|`|WmnE8GOVaa	Because those are the important thing to them. Abortion, gay marriage and so on, are the issues they vote on. Typical conservative issues. Black president? Hell no, that's crazy talk. You know, the issues that don't mean anything in this world. Bugs the crap out of me...|`|Nv0Vi20daa	Because your only other choice is to listen to the lies from the Democratic candidates.  Republicans don't have a lock on political half-truths and to think so is to be incredibly naive.    Republicans may have had a majority in Congress, but no enough to prevent a filibuster by the democrats, so all members must take responsbility for not being able to come to agreement and pass legislation that would benefit the country.    Case in point - there was legislation put forth by Republicans in 2005 (including McCain) to try to deal with the possibility of a mortgage crisis, but there was not one single Democrat that supported it,  To be fair, it also lacked Republican support but the point is that both parties are culpable.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRjsmk74O...  
511e8b445adfad2d427229e044071fa1aa	He's not. His whole voted against his party issue, is something he says NOT others in his party. |`|dN92JApxaa	Voted against his party numerous times, to the point where even his own party members started to not like him.
A3UftwH9aa	Since he's only voted 90% with Bush as opposed to 100%, some may conclude that makes him not as worse.  However, given McCain's unpredictable nature, questionable judgment, and short temper, there's a good possibility that he may be even worse.  He has the backing of pro-war hawks who want to bomb, bomb Iran into oblivion, and has already riled up the Russians for his remarks during the Georgian incursion into S. Ossetia.  Bush was merely a puppet for his neoconservative handlers.  McCain would take the reins and run roughshod over foreign policy.    Hopefully, we will never get the chance to find out how truly bad he could be.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	I think he will be less hesitant to jump into an unnecessary war..which scares me|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Much worse because he has a terrible temper , is cognitively impaired as well as being obsessed with starting and continue wars throughout the world. Sarah Palin compounds the problem, because she's inexperienced, vindictive and justifies  wars on the basis of her Pentecostal theology. Two lunatics running the country is a bit much after what we have  undergone with Bush However I hope Americans wake up and elect Obama|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	A lot better.|`|lgkAnUllaa	a little better but not much better. he is still 90% bush in my book.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	O God, don't say that. Even the thought of McCain being President......(shivers)|`|ciAAdMd2aa	He would be better...    And Obama would be vastly better.|`|gZFiCx1daa	Definatley Better.

McCain said he wouldn't spent any money here in American.  We will start a war with Iran and Russia.  As he spends our money over seas we will see more Food and water poisoning and more Bridges falling and killing people.|`|GlATzQFXaa	Definately better but not by much. Better than obama at least.|`|53MiP9bEaa	flip a coin it could go either way.  I don't see him being much better than Bush though if at all.|`|jsBTsB9raa	He would be a little better but not much. This why i'm going Obama/Biden for some real change. Republicans have had their 8 years, now move aside. |`|sg2UdK5haa	I thilnk he would be an improvement, although not by much.  I would worry he would not be very diplomatic and we'd end up in a another pointless war.    The real problems would start if he died.  Palin has the lack of intelligence and knowledge about the world that bush has, and the secretivness and power hunger of cheney all rolled into one.  What a disaster.  |`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	McCain would be somewhat better I think, though it's hard to tell, I don't know which McCain we would be getting, McCain the senator or McCain the candidate, he's changed many of his opinions.  Palin would be even worse, I feat I had previously believed impossible.|`|86ukTrs1aa	 He would be a little better. |`|8edde553fb96c6c0e8189b3c7844fc69aa	Better.  And he'd be lightyears better than Obama.|`|K54OTyd3aa	At the very least, he is a better human being. |`|12009f569b86be4d7377ccd884a6ce64aa	No one could be much worse than Bush. . . .and then again. . .Palin would give him a run for his money!  So glad we won't have to find out!!!!|`|h2m6yJ7gaa	It would be four more years of the last eight years by people who deserve 10 to 20 years.  Of hard labor and without parole.|`|D4RBT5kCaa	What's the difference? They are both way better than Obama!|`|iCNTcV3baa	It would be the same thing. Only a different name is all  !|`|3GXYel3Kaa	I suppose it depends on what you mean by "better."    I think in terms of honesty and integrity, Senator McCain would be a definite improvement over Bush.  He has a certain moral core that I think speaks well of his character.  Compared to both Presidents Bush and Clinton, he  is a good deal less "political" in the way he deals with political issues.    In terms of substantive policies--especially in regards to fiscal and economic policies, to foreign policy and the war on terror, to judicial appointments, to taxation, to social issues, to the environment--the differences are so negligible as to be indistinguishable from President Bush.    Cheers.|`|0XPmUZpZaa	I suppose he would be a little better. He's still 90% pure-Bush, which is too much to be the next president. Luckily we won't have to worry about this since he is not the next president.|`|P2HZ7RDoaa	McCaint's own words are that he voted with W OVER 90% of the time, so he's pretty much just as horrible as Bush, who is easily the worst of all time.     We can't take another loser like that. The US is hobbling aroud pretty badly right now from 8 years of Republican rule. Another 4 years will just kill us completely! Obama in 08 to save the nation from ruin!|`|99dff2b4eb654e1bc68f6c9d3f2d607eaa	Wow, that is a  tough and scary question cause I am all for Obama/Biden in 08!    But let's see, I really think Cheney is the scarier of the Bush/Cheney ticket and I think Palin is the scarier of the McCain/Palin ticket.  Not only because she does not have any knowledge of important facts.  But also because she is not staying low and learning.  She is speaking out of turn for a vice president and making incorrect statements about McCains platform.  She also overrides him in interviews and that is scary cause it is clear that she intends to skip the internship part and just go ahead and run the show.    She also is way too scary religiously and lives in the right wing fringe.  She appeals to people's anger, fear and prejudice.  She is everything I don't want in a president.  Or a vice president.    I never thought I would think of someone being worse than Cheney, by by Joe, I think I have to say - worse.    I just want to add that the other part of the equation is that 8 years of going the wrong direction is already daunting us.  4 more years is like if you stub your toe really bad in the morning and then drop a brick on it in the afternoon,  you are gonna have a really sore toe.  But then when your kid comes along and drives his toy tractor over the same toe that evening, that is when you will sit down and cry, rocking in agony.  And two weeks later you will discover you have an abscess.        We just cannot take 4 more years.  Not economically.  Not diplomatically in the world, not no way, no how.
AA12173903	I really don't know why so many people think he's the best choice... he doesn't have the right plan(s) and he doesn't listen to a word anyone says especially Obama. When it comes to telling people not to vote for Obama, he's saying the exact opposite of what Obama keeps telling him and the rest of us! McCain himself said that he "voted with the president 90% of the time" which means that these last 8 years of suffering will quickly turn into 12 years. In my opinion he's just old and stubborn. Obama has the right plan, it works, it's logical and fair, and he's been 100% honest about his plans. The only reason Bush was president for the last 8 years was because the stupid electoral system backfired. If they just gave the power of the vote to the people instead of the electoral college then we wouldn't be in this mess, we wouldn't be in Iraq... at most we'd probably be in Afghanistan at least but still with McCain, it's just going to be the same old story from the last 8 years... sounds sad huh?|`|cWyQc7T7aa	That "my friend" jazz has them all fooled.  |`|92gN7RVPaa	McCain is bush .. 90% of him, anyway.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Although McCain does indeed look like someone trustworthy; the simple fact is I do not trust Obama.

Stop the hypothetical questions, deal with what IT IS---reality here now.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Bush... as bad as everyone claims he is, 90% of that is just pure politics.  For instance, the war wasn't questioned until election season hit and it became politically beneficial to the Democrats to question it. If they hadn't gone out of their way to undermine it hoping to claim it as a lost war during Bush's administration we probably wouldn't even still be there.  That's why his overall approval rating for 2007 is 29 and Congress only warrants a 19 for the year.     But, this country hasn't known a president as bad is it will get if it gets Obama.  All this hype about hope and change and not wanting four more years of Bush is nothing but political hype; much like having an election year theme song.  Most people don't have a clue what the REAL issues are that are at stake.|`|uWKlkfoMaa	Bush sucks, but I stand behind Israel 110% and Obama said he does not support Israel (though it isn't a hot issue so not much is being said)    So it would be a lot harder of a choice......

Huckabee came off as very down-to-earth, a good speaker, good sense of humor, very warm and 'human'.  He fell into a trap.  The other Republican candidates were edging away from the Christian Right, and that allowed Huckabee to carve out a niche for himself as 'The Christian Candidate', and that's what hurt him, I think.    Kucinich is a true liberal, like me, and though he sounded a little screechy I really think he had the best ideas of every candidate and was the least willing to moderate and compromise to get votes.    Of the two I would probably vote for Kucinich.  But I would have loved to hear them both debate.|`|LTS3GCpQaa	Huckabee - was a target of a CBC comedy show "Talking to Americans" with Rick Mercer -      Wow what an idiot here is a clip of him congratulating us for preserving our national igloo      http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BhTZ_tgMU...     Hard for me to take this guy seriously      Oh when he "interviews" Bush Jr - he says Prime Minister Poutine      It was Prime Minister Chretien at the time      Poutine is a tasty treat French fries in gravy and cheese curds - It is not good for you - but it is very good tasting -      So Bush just told all of Canada he is friends with fries in gravy with cheese      ----------------     I am sorry but I don't think I've heard of the second guy -which is likely a good sign I don't know|`|iRWF12cWaa	I'd vote Kucinich, I don't know who would win, they're both respectable people, I just disagree with Huckabee's ideology.|`|edwaWk05aa	Kucinich is about 100 years ahead of his time. Huckabee is a nice guy and plenty likable, but he's a creationist, so he's not to be taken seriously. |`|CG5NnL8Yaa	Kuchinich.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I would enthusiastically vote for Kucinich who is pro war, pro people and not a religious lunatic.

His daugher is  hot though.|`|7OlYowmYaa	You must be joking.    Kucinich is delusional. He wants to shut down mines, the coal industry, nuclear power industry.     He basically wants us to live by candlelight by decree. While going green  sounds good, its irresponsible to ignore our cheap resources for things that are 20 years away from being a reality.    Plus Huck plays the bass.|`|KcFtlA3faa	I think both came across as genuine people.

In the past ten to twenty years, the Republican Party has changed from one of common sense to a hateful group of religious wingnuts who will say anything, do anything in order to win.  The last two elections have been dubious at best, and this one is so hard fought that Obama has hired the most prestigious team of lawyers in the country to make sure it runs as smoothly as possible.    Not all Republicans approve of McCain's Campaign tactics. Stirring a crowd to shout racial epithets goes beyond the bounds of common decency. McCain's choice of  Sarah Palin is not approved by many Republicans, including Colin Powell, because they simply do not think she is capable of running the country and lacks knowledge of our government and how it is run. McCain's lack of knowledge and compassion about the struggles of the American people in this Recession or near-Recession hasn't helped him at all!|`|sVym9MjFaa	Whats their problem?

I do not believe that America will no longer be a racist country. It is sad, but it is true. There will be those racist white people (or spanish people) who still do not like black people. There will also be black people who still do not like white people, and a lot of people do not choose to acknowledge this at all, but yes reverse discrimination is just as bad.       So, no. It will be the same, just do your part not to discriminate, and we are one step closer to fixing it. |`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Obama's campaign has set back race relations for at least 30 years.

America as a nation (as evidenced by its policies) is not a racist country. There are individual americans and members of other nations and cultures which are racist in their own way. And to answer the question I think you were trying to ask (because no one is this ignorant) will Obama's inauguration in to presidency end racism in America? Not very likely, people are prejudice and bigots (Obama and his wife are no exception to this as evidenced by things they say and their shameless promotion of race being a determining factor in this race for presidency). His being placed in to this office will not change those ideologies for people that are set in their ways.|`|j0yv0T0oaa	No, I think he has made racial tensions even worse.  The double standard which has allowed his associations and his own words to be acceptable among a large % of America has increased resentment.      If minorities want to be equal, why do they ask for special treatment in the form of affirmative action?  Why are blacks always playing the race card?  Why did Michelle Obama have to say that her husband, as a black man can get shot if he goes to the gas station at night?  What a crock!  Anyone can get shot if they are in the wrong place at the wrong time.    So if minorities want to be equal they need to stop asking for handouts and preferential treatment.|`|bQLQdRBZaa	Not exactly.    By and large, white Americans aren't racist now--or Obama wouldn't be where he is.    But don't kid yourself. Racists are not going to suddenly develop any integrity or morals just because Obama is president. They will continue--as they have for 40 years--to discriminate where they can, to belittle and intimidate, and to promote policies--regardless of the damage such policies may do to our country--that create barriers to opportunity for African Americans and all other disadvantaged groups.    These people are adisease.  Ridding America of them is not the work of a year or a decade or a single political campaign. The formal laws are long gone. Informal social structures remain that these bigots continue to use--all too effectively--to victimize and to spread their poison to the next generation.  The cure is a continuing commitment to justice, continued vigilance--and above all, to educate our children so that they do not contract the infection of racism and bigotry    OBAMA 2008|`|AA12261133	I know a lot of people who are still going to be racist.|`|GCpkdda9aa	I doubt it!

I think the World's Leaders will react differently (in a good way) toward him and the way he handles situations.  I think the world will receive him differently and more openly then any president before.    But will it end racism...unfortunately not.  I am pretty sure there will be people in America who are going to be even more upset if a black man wins, they were racist before and they will be racist after.

Those are the things that give homosexual couples "marital rights".      This is a war of education and ideas.  In Massachusetts they've taught kindergartners about same sex marriages without the ability for the parents to opt out or be notified before hand because, after all, "it's legal".

I am beginning to suspect, Syria is thinking twice about the poison its been nurturing in its borders (which is why its turning to Turkey to cut a peace deal with Israel too).    Without a presence there, and an intelligence agency helping our intelligence services (and they likely do need lots of help), we would be much worse off.|`|2g1KEptwaa	I'm sorry--you'll have to define what YOU mean by "racist". Do you anyone who dares mention absolute Jewish CONTROL of the United States, and perversion of its Foreign Policies on BEHALF of Israel? Because if THAT's your definition, I'd better not mention it, and move along, hadn't I?  The fact is, they RUN the US--even Sharon admitted it (on Israeli radio)--so their letting anyone who ISN'T amenable to favouring Israel, in EVERY department, no matter how ATROCIOUS they behave, would just be senseless and treacherous. Period.   This answers your question--but IS to be discounted, because I must be "a racist".|`|tU912Cawaa	i really don't know-i believe it is all politics|`|182UIiCwaa	No BO is not a staunch supporter of Israel. He acknowledges Iran  the holocaust denier, mark my words if BO is pres, we will pull out to early in Iraq and Iran with Russian support will invade and wipe out Israel. Any one who is Jewish voting for Bo it brainless. Jessie Jackson said it him self with BO in the white mans house Israel will no longer run it, the Muslims will now have a turn. What more do you need as proof these are his views. WOW so uninformed Americans are right not. Remember elections have consequences. |`|OOmKOCHXaa	It's important politically because they will lose a lot of votes if they don't.  There's probably not a ton of Jewish people who would vote for a candidate who supports the Palestinian people, and there are even less evangilical Christians who would.    As for why it's really important, it isn't.  And we shouldn't be supporting Israel.  They have one of the worst human rights abuse records on the globe, and our position on the UN Security Council keeps them safe.  It might be important to have an ally in the middle east, but probably doesn't help that much when that ally is the only country that is hated more than that US.|`|qww6Hpm4aa	The truth of the matter is we do support Israel, but at the same time we keep them on a "Diplomatic Leash".    Most people don't realize that if it were not for the US ongoing intervention and negotiation with the Israelis, they would have sent ALL of the Arabs and Persians to meet Allah a long time ago...|`|MCkJxjyfaa	the media in the US is extremely bias towards Israel (I wonder why) and many people in the US think the TV as the absolute truth. and the President wants there support.    The Americans make me laugh, they prefer to spend their money to buy guns to land thieves and war criminals rather then getting health insurance and better education for THEMSELVES!!! 
o23hIdOvaa	Republicans are trying to say that this is reverse psychology. Sad. That is a poor argument for what the message that is being conveyed is. I have traveled abroad (proud military wife) and have heard many reasons why people abroad prefer Obama - he gives the perception of peace. With peace, you have no reasonable measure or justifiable purpose for war. If Obama wants to talk first, then what rhetoric do extremist have to justify jihads? You can't hate an enemy that is not attacking you or trying to use bully tactics to convey their message.|`|8KlYZCMGaa	I disagree because Hezbollah and Hamas want Obama to win because he is Muslim and will be on their side.  Khaddafi is also supporting Obama.  Obama wants to pull out of Iraq ASAP.    Go onto YouTube and in the search section, enter Obama/Terrorism  Why do you think that Obama won't admit that the surge is working?    next sites to go to are www.mx.youtube.com/watch?v=gA6_k3NtXZs and www.obamacrimes.com|`|Cf4Ywe23aa	I can understand why they would say that - though I'm surprised that they have.  Obama is more likely to negotiate in order to get peace deals in the middle east. If this happens then Al Qaida would have a lot less to be angry about and they would have less of a reason to bomb the crap out of us.   So for their sick-o murdering followers to continue down the path of hate then a McCain war-mongering presidency would be ideal.  It makes perfect sense - if you're a terrorist...  |`|cKuppxUQaa	what better way for Al QUAIDA  to get people to vote for Obama than to announce something like this.|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	Sounds like Al Qaeda wants Obama in the white house.|`|dBtFTxjRaa	Laughing my butt off!!!!  Can't wait till Election Day.|`|e204753a9c4984683b978847f58e2029aa	What do I think? I think it's a bunch of hooey! If there's gonna be an attack it will happen when the foreign policy virgin Obama takes office.|`|555a84236b0e6d62ffe37c6a72ec6b2daa	It is basicly true... both wars will contuine under McCain, while under Obama they will end by the US cutting and running. Now the true question would be does Al-Qaida really want to keep fighting over there or do they want to fight softer targets on US soil.|`|Gevg9i1vaa	LMFAO at the McCain supporters trying to spin this one.  These are the same guys that said terrorists support Obama because Hezbollah and Hamas said they endorse Obama because he'll open diplomatic talks in the region.  But then when Al Qaeda say they endorse McCain they say it's "reverse pschology".....the hypocrisy never ends does it.|`|flrOp5YLaa	Those incompetent fools can't sway my vote.  They are so arrogant to think that our lives revolve around THEM!      |`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	It's reverse psychology and not true. They want Obama to win, therefore, state RIGHT before the election that they support McCain. So, come on....|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Yeah, after all Al Qaeda would never lie to damage McCain's campaign. Those are some honorable terrorists.|`|lMR4PpATaa	Just as you expect McCain supporters to dismiss fantasies about Obama, I expect that you will do the same for McCain.|`|UmeQjw72aa	False statement|`|252488faa61d45ab5dd0a3a3b86bd138aa	Not especially surprising.     Their aim is the disruption of our society. Seems to be working so far (with Bush).     McCain would continue the mistakes.    The true patriot is an informed voter.  |`|2NjavTlaaa	http://www.newsmax.com/headlines/obama_s...|`|AA10648704	Sounds like they know him pretty well.  They can't keep killing as many Americans if we use diplomatic methods to fend them off, instead of always going for the military option first.

Obama has voted, not 1 time, but 4 times to have a ban on late term abortions....so, yes, he does support murder in a different sense.  There was a nurse that I saw on tv in Chicago a couple of months ago and she was very distraugt.  There was a couple that aborted their 5 or 6 month fetus. The attending nurse wrapped this baby boy up in a cloth and put him in a closet to die.  This nurse that was in the interview heard about it and went to find him.  She held him for 45 minutes until he died in her arms.  She did not want him to die alone.If someone could have intervened then he could possibly be in the arms of loving parents.  The nurse investigated this whole situation and found that nothing was done illegally.  So yes, I do feel that Obama has some blood on his hands.  to get more facts on Obama..go to youtube and in the search, enter  Obama/Ayers, Obama/abortion, Obama/ACORN and Obama/Terrorism and you will see what Obama doesn't want you to see.  the 2 newest are a must see...www.mx.youtube.com/watch?v=gA6_k3N... and www.obamacrimes.com.

Bush ruined our country & most people knew this was happening & that is why they voted dems into congress but the dominos were already tumbleing. They inherited an impossible situation & now Obama has also but atleast he is not a destructo like McCain would have been.

It plain wrong, high, taxes in a free market place only serve to increase poverty, everywhere its tried.    We have to lower the taxes even on the rich. In the 1980s Reagan did just that taking the top marginal tax rate from 70% down to 28% and the economy took off. The government doubled its take, because even with the low tax rate, the rich were expanding their businesses and generating more profit that the government could tax.

End of story|`|62f16dd680be1db7598eb6b8faaa8e4faa	YES. There have been many stories of inventors who invents news means of energy use and they have been threatened with being injured or killed - by the oil companies - if they persist in continuing their inventions.     The OIL companies are desperate to KEEP their status as the ONLY source of energy allowed. BUT the oil will run out sometime in the next 100 years.      The Transduced Engine    GASOLINE NOT NEEDED. The creation of the transduced engine is by a former United States Marine whos remained unnamed due to threats.    The engine used no fossil fuel no giant 300 pound batteries, but a self contained 346hp fluid dynamics worm drive powerplant. Already capable of going into any vehicle here in the US. The engine is a combination of electrical and fluid dynamics to produce power to the drive system with compressed air flow and on the go regenerative components in a self charging package.    It has no spark plugs, no fuel injection system no exhaust, no emissions, no polutions, no antifreeze, a list of 100 regular things a gas or desiel engine requires.    So what gives why cant everyone have one. Well the Federal Goverment doesnt want it built. Why? Because Oil guys will loose there shorts, Big business will loose money, an estimated 500,000 would loose there jobs in the Auto Unions because what they build is not needed for the transduced motor.    BUT if the Big 3 did utilize the Transduced Engine it would take only 140 days for the Saudi Kings to loose 10 trillion dollars in oil sales forcing them to depend on the US not the other way around.    You really want to make a difference and never have to pay for gas again. REALLY?!! Then post this everywhere and on JULY 4th 2008 be ready for the introduction of the Transduced Engine information to be releaded Built BY AMERICANS FOR AMERICANS!!!!!|`|MEReSvZeaa	The solution is to drill.

Objectively.|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	I don't think anyone would rate Bush as one of our best Presidents, even those who support him, if only for his inability to maintain public support through his Administration.  That's a real shame considering the seriously bad hand he's been dealt by world affairs and domestic situations beyond his control.  Bush has done a very good job with many things and a far better job on the economy than the media has given him credit for in their zeal to elect Obama.  He has done an incredible job in the reorganization of the intelligence apparatus of the US Government with the foundation of the Department of Homeland Security which was long, long overdue.  Whoever is elected president will owe him a huge debt of gratitude for that and for the entire redesign and modernization of the antiquated  White House communication system.    With the objectivity that some time will bring, he will be rated far higher than the Bush-haters of today will ever believe.|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	Ask this question in say 100 years you would be able to get a much more objective answer then.  Right now all you are going to get is how much he is hated and despised with no objectivity at all.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Not even close.

This " brain cell" IS the greatest        ? president that we have ever had!!!!!|`|6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	History will answer your question.  He spoke the truth in "axis of evil," but the truth is far from the minds of the ungodly.  He has kept his word and he promised to go after the terrorists wherever they are.  He saw 3,000 Americans die and was smart enough to realize that we have an enemy that must be dealt with.  Clinton ignored the enemy and the enemy took his doing nothing as a weakness.      George Bush has been a strong  President and not all of his decisions have been correct.  I thoroughly disagree with the allowing a Palestinian state by giving back land to Palestine.  Palestine has never wanted a state.  If they had wanted a state they would have already had one.  The Palestinians are there to allow the Jew haters to kill Jewish people.    If Palestine wanted peace, they would already have peace.  The Palestinians and all Arab nations surrounding Israel want the death of Israel and they will not settle for anything less.     I say to Israel - hold all the land that you have taken - take back every strip of land that God said He gave to you and tell the enemies of Israel to jump in the creek.  Get the Gaza Strip back first and do not ever give up land to these godless people.  You don't even know who you are in the eyes of God.  God calls you the "Apple of His Eye."  God tells every people "I will bless those who bless you (Israel) and I will curse those who curse you (Israel).      When God stands up and fights for Israel the whole world will be in awe of His power and who can stay the arm of God?    God calls Jerusalem His land and God calls Israel His people who will serve Him.  Israel is the true branch; we Christians are the grafted in branch.  I know Israel is tired of fighting, they've been fighting ever since 1948 when they became a nation in one day.  I know Israel will almost do anything to get peace, but just hold on.  Jesus is returning soon.  And believe it or not, but many Islamic Arabs are coming to know the Lord daily.  God loves the Arab people and Jesus died on the cross for them also.  He is coming to them in dreams, in visions and bringing even TV programs into their countries.    One thing I know for sure and that is that the Lord controls the minds of our leaders and God will do with our leaders as He wants and they cannot do anything about it.  God says He will even confuse their minds to where they fight each other.  No man can stand against God.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Nope.

Iraqis , themselves asked bush to export his type of democracy into their country.i hate all those intellectuals and economists who allege that his casino type of capitalist economic policies led to present global finance crisis. because he had a noble soul and a champion of those poor bankers, he got passed a $700 billion bill.|`|HHuS48u5aa	Many would say Reagan.    Few would say Bush I or II.    I think time will tell.    I totally disagree with Bush Bashing. I have nothing whatsoever bad to say about either Bush.    There have been a whole lot worse..loads of them.  I put him top 15%.  How's that for an approval rating? Thanks for asking.    P.S. Bush could have done better at explaining some things. Part of the issue is he never told us why he did some things. He did the right thing, we just do not understand.    Americans don't know what is going on..we are kept in the dark so as not to be afraid. There have been more near attacks on the US over time than you and I will ever know.     *************************  FDR was a nightmare. He was the worst president. He prolonged a recession..with his tampering..and socialist agenda    Johnson second worse. He wrecked the country irreversibly with 1965 legislation on immigration..and others. Johnson escalated Vietnam and killed lots of people.    Kennedy was good at economics and the missile crisis and bad on civil rights. we would have been better off with a Republican.     Clinton brought bad policies and a bad name to the white house.    Hoover was bad as he did nothing..but not nearly as bad as the activists.    That's my bad list.|`|Ho3lRmDMaa	<sound of crickets>|`|1fitU8yraa	That was funny the first time, This is sad now. |`|eHEvcv7vaa	no|`|3zxEFHI7aa	I know everyone's bashing on the guy, and they've made that movie, "W" based on him, but it sort of bothers me. I think his heart is in the right place. Everyone disagrees with his war in Iraq strategies. Can you really blame him? He's trying to make sure we're safe. The question is:    Would you rather some of our men get killed over there in their territory,    or them come over here and kill us on ours?      The difference in the number of lives that are saved is substantial. He's not the greatest president we've ever had (I give that to Abraham Lincoln or JFK), but I don't think he's done as terrible as everyone complains. Look at Clinton. The guy was impeached, and yet he never left! Where's the justice in that????      Personally, I feel sorry for Bush. He's not the greatest, but I somehow like him. Hmm. Idk. He's just a human, like everyone else. |`|7pgRpiXeaa	The only way W. could be considered as the greatest president of any ones lifetime is if they are no more than 7 years old.|`|m2qEgGjTaa	Greates liar. Greatest disgrace. For sure.    He's a pawn of special interests.  He a war criminal. He's a thief and a liar who surrounded himself with like minded fools who took every opportunity to fleece this nation and ruin the economy, the environment, the health and welfare of millions of Americans, while making a few close friends and puppeteers who orchestrated his presidency, very wealthy.     Add a bunch of ignorant voters and you get the worst president in history.     Why do you think he's so fearful and critical of trial lawyers.  Lawyers and jury trials are one of the few and final vestiges of power for the little guy. Large judgments against companies that do real harm is not something Bush and his friends are fond of. Republicans do not like the idea of any tools for equalizing power.    Who are the kids who are killed and maimed in the illegal war Republicans had to lie to create?  Not their kids.     Bush has all the qualities to be the greatest criminal in the history of this nation.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	State capitalist, Stalinist. That he claimed to be a socialis and communist does not make it fact.    The 1911 revolution against the imperial system produced years of rule by a series of warlords and immense class tensions that erupted during the second Chinese Revolution from 1925-1927. The crushing of the working class was followed by the establishment of a corrupt dictatorship under Chiang Kai-sheks Kuomintang (KMT). Japanese imperialism invaded Manchuria in 1931 and then the entire country in 1937, wreaking devastation.    In the aftermath of World War II, the KMT dictatorship could barely hold the country together, let alone create the political conditions for economic recovery. In the late 1940s, hyperinflation, official corruption and the bankruptcy of the credit system rocked Chinas industries. The incapacity of the KMT government to resolve the economic crisis turned sections of the Chinese bourgeoisie, such as Rong, toward the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under Mao Zedong.  Based on the rural peasantry, the CCP had long before abandoned its founding principle of socialist internationalism. Instead, Mao upheld the two-stage theory advanced by the Stalinist bureaucracy in the Soviet Union, which was directly responsible for the tragic defeats of the Chinese working class in 1927. Repudiating the lessons of the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Stalinists maintained that China had to pass through a prolonged period of capitalism before there could be any possibility of the working class taking power.  After Japans surrender in 1945, Mao advanced the same pro-capitalist perspective, calling for a bourgeois coalition government with the KMT. This was promoted under the mantra of a bloc of four classesan alliance between the working class, the peasantry, the petty-bourgeoisie and a so-called progressive layer of national capitalists.  The Cultural Revolution of the 1960sin essence a factional struggle between Mao and the capitalist roaderssaw Rong temporarily sidelined. In 1966, Maos Red Guards stormed into his mansion and beat his wife. The premier Zhou Enlai intervened, however, to prevent any further attacks. Zhou declared: He [Rong] is a representative of the Chinese national capitalists and influential at home and abroad. He must be protected.  Today, Maos China is one of the key props of the world capitalist order. Much of world manufacturing relies on the ruthless exploitation of the Chinese working class. Chinas foreign trade reached $1.148 trillion in the first 10 months of this year and the country has been the second largest buyer of US treasury bonds after Japan, helping to finance the huge US deficits. It is also one of the top importers of oil and raw materials, shoring up a number of capitalist economies such as Australias.    It is evident to many people today that China is not communist. But the life of Rong Yirenthe capitalist who occupied key positions and amassed enormous wealth in communist Chinademonstrates that the claims of the Beijing regime to be socialist were bogus from the very start.|`|Nzchak7gaa	No, Communism like Capitalism will and have repeatedly used Socialism for their own selfish reasons.

NVL8BkLdaa	What is really sad is that more people in this country don't see this. Those that do should feel really happy with their vote.|`|a66nvk0taa	That just one journalist opinion. So you basic your views on what this journalist has wrote wow. Most journalists give a one sided view on any given topic. Journalists always give a one sided view basic on their own political ideology    A written piece by a journalist doesn't represent the whole nation of that country. That is just one individual view.|`|r8rykCkGaa	I know.  This is what I found out.  There is a great deal of hatred towards America but actually America has stuck their necks out to help others and they don't see any of this or appreciate it.  Instead they buy all the rumors that go around inciting hatred against the USA.  It makes you wonder if it's safe to live here any longer.  The president of Iran says "America is going to disappear."  Does he think he a God himself?  It would seem so.  He's ready to kill off anyone who disagrees with him.    No matter what Bush did people would have complained against him.  What was he supposed to do when we were attacked?  Sit there and twiddle his thumbs?  He had to figure out what to do and do it quickly.  He deserved our prayers day and night.  And how many people in the US were praying for him often?  And how many were bashing him often?  People were saying there were no hidden weapons in Iraq.  That was not true.  They were transferred to Syria and both Iraq and Syria lied about it but they believed them.  The huge 18 wheelers were seen taking the weapons to Syria but it couldn't be reported publicly or they were afraid to report it.  Many things that mmight have protected the president were not reported but the negatives, the rumors and the lies and twisted facts were what people were repeating.    It is the bad presidents who do a lot of evil such as Clinton who the media protects.  He's the one who kept the war going in Bosnia and who did he help?  It was the terrorists.  Also people got together to give a large amount of money to the oppressed Christians in southern Sudan and Clinton said he would give it to them, but he gave it to the wrong person---their enemies in Northern Sudan who were bombing them.  And who started all the bad stuff that is going on in the schools?  It certainly wasn't Bush.  The Clintons had a lot to do with the changes in teaching.    No, we don't need another liberal president who will rewrite the constitution, and appt liberal ACLU judges who will legislate from the bench and put many more curses on the US.  We need to stay in the war until we win it----it would be genocide for the innocent Iraqis if we pulled out now.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	i believe obama is a racist. however, being white, i am not allowed to be hurt by that.|`|Y1wKTa8Saa	i think America will be dead tuesday if obama is elected.|`|1aeaa686abcbe8f1f0dd5960883ff486aa	No.  We are a sovereign nation.  |`|NZ5Oj415aa	With respect to Rezco, Obama spent a day with the entire Chicago Tribune editorial staff, including Kass and Zorn, answering every question in exhaustive, documented detail, after which the editors endorsed his campaign.  What else have you got?    With respect to William Ayers:    One mans terrorist is another mans hero.    By current definition, Pastor Dietrich Bonhoeffer was a terrorist.  He planned to bomb and kill leaders of an administration that had the overwhelming support of the population.  He was caught and executed for the crime of treason.  He was reviled as a traitor.    Yet today he is a hero throughout Germany.  The current generation understands that Hitler was guilty of waging an unjust war.  To avoid such guilt, Germans today believe that it is the moral duty of all taxpayers to stop, by any and all means, an unjust war being waged with their taxes.    Pastor Bonhoeffers heroism was recognized gradually as the new generation replaced the old.  Justice triumphs, but only in dispassionate eyes.    Hero?  Traitor?  That depends entirely on whether Hitlers war just or unjust.    Whether William Ayers was a traitor or a hero depends only upon whether the war against Vietnam was just or unjust.    That is the fundamental question that must be asked and answered.    That is the question that politicians and intellectuals avoid.    Not me.    William Ayers was absolutely right to bomb empty buildings.  To avoid being also guilty of the murder of millions of innocent people, it is categorically imperative according to the moral laws of every major philosophy and religion that every taxpayer must do everything possible to stop an unjust* war being fought with his/her taxes.    Ayers and the other war protesters were ultimately successful in driving Nixon out or his mind and out of office and ending the holocaust that murdered milliona of innocent Vietnamese people.  All Americans owe them a moral debt that cannot be repaid.    William Ayers is a hero but it will take another generation or two to see it.    * See "In Retrospect", a book written years after the war by ex-Secretary of Defense Robert MacNamara, who designed and managed the war against Vietnam for seven years under Kennedy and Johnson and who knew as much about the background of the war and its cause as anyone else  Five million Vietnamese were killed over a thirty year period while successfully defending their backward nation against France and the USA, the most technologically advanced nations, in a war that MacNamara finally admitted was "...wrong, terribly wrong" and that nobody tries to defend today.    Also see the book "Mandate for Change", 1958, written by President Dwight D. Eisenhower.  (When France refused to hold UN supervised elections, he accepted the strings of the puppet government.)  In the book, he reports that the CIA told him that "more than 80% of the Vietnamese people support Ho Chi Minh".    With respect to Reverend Wright:    The aim of "Black Liberation Theology" is to cure the effects of the destruction of the Black family structure caused by slavery, Jim Crow laws, segregation, and still-existing prejudice such as you demonstrate.    The Black community needs the cohesion that the theology promotes.  Among the thousand families in the Trinity Church neighborhood, only 5% are successful - and they tend to move to a better neighborhood, depriving the other 95% of a role model.  The theology provides the "patriotism" needed to preserve the community.    I do not believe that successful White supremacists such as yourself are going to move into that community to serve as a role model.  Am I right?|`|3XBxc0ksaa	The opinion of the world doesn't count at all since they can't vote in US elections.    However, we Americans always say that our President is the leader of the Free World. Therefore, we should at least consider what the free world is saying about our elections. I'm not saying that we follow what the Free World says, but things will be a lot easier if other countries are friendly to the US.     I believe that Obama will strengthen our relationship with our allies, since our allies hate George W. Bush.
33ppbrMJaa	We are so dependent upon Saudi Arabia for oil. Confronting them about their ties with the Sunnis might cause them to cut off our supplies.  Then, too, perhaps a meeting isn't necessary. President Bush is great friends with the Royal Family and with the super wealthy and influential bin Ladens. They may be holding weekly chats, for all we know.    In Iraq, there has been what might be called a Switcheroo. We now put out millions of dollars in salaries for the Sunnis, whose job it is to guard gated neighborhoods and drive out Al Queda. In the meantime, the Shiite Mahdi Army is laying low, awaiting word from Al Sadr. If this cleric lifts the "truce," all hell will break out again.    It was, and is, a War for Oil.  The War on Terror label was used as a fear tactic. Of course, it was a war on terror. In all wars, the enemy could be called a terrorist.  It was an unnecessary war and Oil is the only benefit. The trouble is, the benefit goes to International Corporations and not to the people of the United States, who have paid to enrich these Corporations.|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	That's because along with Israel and China, Saudi Arabia OWNS the USA. We've all seen the footage of Bush holding hands with and kissing Saudi's in the mouth...|`|iVv6bFW2aa	That's because the US Government and Bush in particular are tied to the Saudi oil interests. The US also tolerates the abuse of women there, while criticizing other countries for the same reasons. The US concern for human rights is totally political and determined by how much the Us can profit from a given country.|`|d6VyFGo3aa	No, the picture is very accurate.  We keep our mouths shut when it comes to Saudi because of their oil and the number of American oil companies that are involved with them.  This is VERY big business which circumvents politics, war, friendship, etc.  When Saudi asks the USA for more planes why do we give it to them?  Oil.  It is the only good thing (for now) that they have going for themselves. America...dig, dig,dig! |`|AA11711276	The Saudis are not our government's designated enemies at the moment.|`|29f2a6150f2dc60cb9c81ce4f37985baaa	Well now, we just DO not talk about such things, lest we remind folks what we are really up to.|`|KXlNXhmkaa	the answer is simple: economics.  without saudi's oil, majority of the world's businesses will close.  as long as the u.s., along with other powerful nations, have not come up with a way to cut off dependence on saudi oil, the mouth kissing will continue.  what strange bedfellows...|`|AA11992587	I agree that there is not much coverage.  What is known is that Osama Bin Laden was a Saudi in exile at the time of 9/11.  One  beef he had with the Saudi government was that they had allowed American troops on Saudi soil during the first gulf war.  9/11 may have even been timed to coincide with a visit to the United States by some of the Saudi Royal family members as a kind of protest.  There appears to be not only a conflict between Sunni and Shia sects of Islam, but conflicts within each sect as well.  One could surmise that the rulers of Saudi Arabia support American policy but are not in control of all Saudi citizens many of which have a drastically different view.  |`|A4vc2Dg9aa	Oil is only a plausible excuse.    The real agenda is a one world-government. A Socialist-Fascist government under the control of the world's elites, and manipulated through the UN.    In order to establish this government it is necessary to undermine the world's Democracies. This is being done through manipulation and fear. America and Britain are the first and most important Democracies to undermine as their rights and freedoms are the biggest obstacle to this agenda.     Hence we have "terrorist" events such as Oklahoma and 9/11, resulting in unConstitutional laws being rammed through Congress without proper process.    That was the thin end of the wedge that will separate the People from ALL of their rights and freedoms unless they wake up to what is really going on. There is high probability for another "terrorist" attack to be staged as a pretext for bombing Iran and declaring martial law. This may happen before the current administration leaves the White House, and may delay the next presidential inauguration indefinitely.    Wake Up People!|`|lDliaFlYaa	they don't thinks our men and women that are over are important

Despite all of this, there are racist fools in this country who are only too willing to spread their hatred and bigotry around.    In my eyes, Obama is a gift to the American people from a higher power, a gift intended to help wipe out some of the anger and hatred in this country, able and willing to heal the wounds we have inflicted upon our selves, a man with an speaking ability to inspire and lead.  This is the kind of man who arrives on the scene only once in a lifetime, a man with the ability to point the way.    But there are dark forces out there, forces with an eye on the Money Pot, resenting any attempt to give the government back to the people. These forces are able to hire some bigoted fool to do their dirty work and conspire to remove any leader capable of inspiration.    Think of it!  Most of the presidents assassinated or who have been injured in attempted assassinations have not been our worst presidents, but our best ones!  The worry is there, and we can only hope that the Secret Service can do their jobs!|`|FVs2GRxGaa	for certain they will have more security.. not that it will do much.   if the person doing it in the first place believes it needs to be done.. it will be done.. regardless.  |`|AA10741077	I feel that in certain places yes the secret service will have to amp up the protection, but the people keeping the president safe do a very good job these days and routinely take alot of precautions.

To be honest I don't think his family really has to worry too much, just Mr. Obama himself...I could be completely wrong in my feelings though, but if anyone were to target him I think it would be just him.

A4vc2Dg9aa	I believe that anyone has the right to defend themselves against crime or aggression, be they individuals, a community, or a nation.    That being said, I do not consider it a right to engage in "pre-emptive defense" by attacking before being attacked.    Those who are misguided enough to engage in such practices are becoming precisely what they fear from their adversaries - they are becoming the aggressor.    Of course all kinds of "spin" can be placed on information to "prove" that country "X" was going to attack, and all kinds of evidence can be submitted.     However recent history has shown how unscrupulous individuals bent on gaining power and wealth can manufacture false evidence or perpetrate "false-flag" operations and so try to justify their own aggressive actions.     Yes I would call such people "terrorists", and sociopaths.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, but it's not happening because the UK, as well as the US are obsessed with attacking the  Iranian government|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	"believes in arms struggle" ..You mean like US army ?

To many people, the West is where the terrorists are.  Certain religious fanatics think we are sinful, greedy and evil. We, on the other hand, consider them evil and sinful.  We say "God is on our side!"  On the other hand, jihadists say that "Allah is on our side!"    I am sure that, in Iraq, the insurgents are considered Freedom Fighters. We consider them the enemy.  So, depending upon where you were born and the country you love, terrorists are always on the other side.    I often wonder if any country should dabble in the government of another country and take sides at all.  I can't help but hope that Iran loses the leaders it presently has, and I understand the younger people there are ready for a more democratic state.    But I think it is a mistake to promote or provoke war. There is another way to do it, through diplomatic talks and treaties, and that is the way to go.  If events occur that make diplomacy fail, then that is another story. But we have no right to stick our noses into Iranian government, nor does England.  If a country supports an upheaval of the government in another country, it sure should be done covertly and carefully, lest a chaos like Iraq is the result.|`|412f673354a42041faf908ccbc558571aa	They are called "Freedom Fighters".

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No that's silly.  Voting for Obama as a white democrat isn't showing solidarity with black democrats. There are plenty of reasons like party loyalty, liking his ideas, whatever, better reasons than showing solidarity to black democrats. You almost make his candidacy seem like an affirmative action achievement.    Anyone who votes based solely on race should get over themselves yes but American liberals should stop with the identity politics.  Barack Obama is a millionaire, he does not represent an advancement of the vast majority of minorities or white people for that matter trying to make ends meet.  The top one percent in American society controls more than 45 percent of the wealth. The top one-tenth of one percent has monopolized nearly the entire increase in national wealth over the last two decades, while the vast majority of the people have seen their living conditions deteriorate, their jobs become more precarious, their overall social position become more insecure.  For black workers and youth, the decline has been even more precipitous. It is hardly necessary to recite the well-known figures: more young black men in prison than in college, crumbling schools and other social services in the inner cities, poverty levels once again approaching those of the early 1960s, disproportionate levels of unemployment, drug abuse, violence, homelessness and other social evils.  This social polarization has been to some extent masked by the inclusion of a small layer of blacks, women, gays, Hispanics, etc., in the privileged elite. But the rise of an Oprah Winfrey or a Tiger Woods or a Barack Obama (or a Hillary Clinton) does not make America a more egalitarian society.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jun200...  The embrace of identity politics was based on an evasion of the fundamental class issues in American society. No Democrat politician today could denounce the pernicious influence of the financial oligarchs, as Roosevelt did, without suffering immediate political oblivion.  This obsessive focus on secondary issues of race, gender, sexual orientation, etc., was on display throughout the Democratic convention, where speaker after speaker sought to avoid the overriding social fact of deepening economic inequality, the polarization of American society between a relative handful of multi-millionaires and billionaires, and the vast majority who work for a living.  The credibility of postwar American liberalism and the middle-class consumer society it espoused depended on a continuation of the economic expansion that followed the war and ever-rising prosperity. But by the late 1960s, the boom was beginning to unravel. The impact of the Vietnam War, the civil rights struggles, urban riots and a strike wave fueled by worsening economic conditions undermined the New Deal coalition. Within a few years the Democratic Party was openly distancing itself from New Deal social reform policies.  American liberalism and the Democratic Party are based on an evasion of the fundamental class issues that dominate American society. Instead, they focus obsessively on secondary issues of race, gender, age, etc., and thereby exacerbate such differences and impart to them a malignant character.  Since the party is not based on any coherent program, its candidates must make their appeal by adopting personas designed to win support from different constituent elements of the party amalgam. In the past Democratic primary contest, thar took on absurd forms for example.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/apr200...|`|CIZV07Tsaa	I don't think most Democrats (or most Americans, for that matter) have a problem with Obama's race.    I believe the vast majority of Democrats will stand together for this election.

He was outlawed by President Grant with the KKK Act of 1871.  (Grant was a republican.)    You should know that democrats are the only people who have ever enslaved blacks and fought agaisnt their attainment of civil rights.    Democrats fought the civil rights acts of 1864 and 1871 and eventually had them repealed.    Democrats created Jim Crow laws in the south, forcing blacks into seperate public accomodations in the south.    Democrats defended segregation, sometimes violently, for more than 100 years in the souther states.    Democrats controlled almost entirely the political offices of the southern states for 100 years and failed to prosecute lynch mobs.

NEVER  
zEHU0E9Yaa	No, I disagree. Here's why (sorry for being complex here.) Having an uncle who is a Wall Street broker I can honestly say that there is nothing wrong with responsible, ethical trading practice. Under President Clinton the United States saw a 10,000 point rise in the Dow and Americans enjoyed greater economic benefit because of it. More businesses opened, including "Main Street" businesses, and unemployment hit all-time lows. In other words, responsible economics benefits BOTH Wall Street and Main Street.    Obama is simply using rhetorical soundbites and people's preference of us-versus-them dichotomies. Honestly, I feel it's derisive and subverts needed unity.    However, that being said, I do not believe that McCain's "fundamental" policy is beneficial. It is NOT a responsible policy and it does not specifically benefit Wall Street OR Main Street. instead it smacks of the same economic-political nepotism that the Bush/Cheney administration has been so guilty of.|`|ejSiGw0faa	Republican economic politics are such that they believe if you give tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, they will be doing so well, they'll want to share it by hiring people.  It hasn't worked for 8 years.    Democrats such as Barack believe in giving those tax breaks to people making less than 250,000 per year and tax those making over 250,000 a year in a higher tax bracket.      I don't know about you people, but I'm ready to try anything that is the opposite of Bush's policies, which would be Obama!|`|MEReSvZeaa	McCain was right about the fundamentals of our economy being strong.    We still have no inflation and gas prices are going down.    We still have low unemployment, in fact, unemployment in my state went DOWN in September.    Obama is a dufus.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, I agree with Obama 100%. Main Street gets screwed for many reasons, they are cannon fodder in the wars, the poor are subsidizing the rich tax wise, out sourcing, unemployment, limited  health insurance, in adequate assistance to people who have or are in danger of losing their homes, anti choice, discrimination against gays and a million other things|`|Lq4306a5aa	He's right essentially|`|92a950650022dd6b96deb0c9fe82a4fbaa	I agree whole heartily. McCain has no clue and has changed his position so many times it is hard to tell what he is up to now.     And to liberal but licker. You must not have a 401k After employer matching ours is still down from june. Yeah the economy is strong alright. These guys are just too funny.|`|5hxWSezPaa	Perhaps he is correct.  And that is good.  Main Street will not do good unless Wall Street does well.  In other words, if businesses whose stock is publicly traded do well then Main Street will do well.  That is sound economic policy.
zEHU0E9Yaa	It's like this...candidates like to simultaneously portrait themselves as "an average guy" while wrapping themselves in the American Flag. The actions, when you think about it, are kind of mutually exclusive.    The truth is that the only laws that pertain to becoming a president is that you have to be over 35 years of age and you have to be a US citizen.    Regrettably, it involves so much more than that. First of all you mus have a minimum of 1 million dollars in disposable income or there is no way you can generate enough advertising for people to even know who you are, let alone get enough votes for your name to appear on the ballot. But as Ross Perot demonstrated (he spent 65 million back in 1992) you need more than just money. You need solid business and political contacts.     BOTH Obama and McCain know their own "Joe the CEO"s, They also know their own "Joe the Judge"s, "Joe the Governor"s, and "Joe the Senator"s. You don't get as far as they did without knowing those people. The trouble is that despite those "Joes", you still need "Joe the plumber" to vote for you.    To summarize, they both married to the rich, but they are looking to have an affair with the poor. And like any infidelitous lover, they are willing to whisper whatever sweet nothings they have to to coax Joe the plumber into their beds.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Nonsense Obama was second in line to get hand outs from Fannie Mae first was Dodd/Obama/Franks .Obama had more earmarks McCain had none Obama runs on lies he be Little's his voters by throwing lies  out because he doesn't feel his voters are educated and will believe anything he says so far he is right.|`|u23sBafTaa	He is not in cahoots with the CEO's that just crap.

AFqZEOlRaa	Depends on what you mean by leadership.  We long ago lost our right to moral leadership.  We have financial leadership because most of the world's money is concentrated in this country, since we are running it on money borrowed from around the world.  Will we remain the military leader?  It's doubtful, since we have bankrupted ourselves fighting this "war" in Iraq.  The only way a country can maintain a large military force is to do like North Korea and spend the entire GNP on the military and let the rest of the people starve.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No because capitalism has been a failure and has now affected international markets. In addition the US foreign policy, including the invasions f other countries, has created a great deal of resentment. The US can't and won't be the global leader in anything anymore, except if they introduce socialism.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	No, the world wide impact is proof of that..|`|w3OJpcIvaa	Everybody else's economy tanked when ours did.

dQcPV4Rqaa	Okay....listen very carefully....he will not be voting for anything once he is elected...He will be the"President of the United States of America" The programs that he plans to put into action will create jobs, lower taxes for most of us, enable many millions who dont have health insurance to be covered, allow more money for schools ( who desperately need it) repair infrastructure, he will end this miserable war that would have turned out like Viet Nam....over 50, 000 American Soldiers died in Viet Nam and then after years of fighting, we turn and run from Hanoi like scared rabbits...nice piece of history for you....Most of the money that Obama will save on war spending can be allocated for domestic issues...Wouldn't it be amazing to actually use some American money to help with American issues???

Obama 08|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, basically McCain wrong. Obama wants to eliminate takes for those earning under $250,000, and increase them for those who earn more. In addition he wants to increase the capital gains tax and stop wars, which will allow for less taxes, and taxation of the rich. He is right when he talks about redistributing income. The rich should give back to the country what they have gotten. Incidentally, under Reagan, Bush, Sr and Bush Jr taxes and deficits have gone up except for the rich. Bush Sr was defeated when he advocated  for higher taxes and said read my lips. These taxes were to be used for corporate welfare and wars.|`|Fv8C8ysNaa	It's true.  Obama also said he would bring back Clinton's taxes.  I know for a fact middle class Americans were paying higher taxes under Clinton than they are with Bush.|`|058801b5ebff605f17ff7146519276bfaa	From everything that I have read, reliable sources only, the answer would be, yes.|`|2BdxLgO4aa	No. But if that is what you think, vote for McCain. What is the point of this question?|`|AA11317388	Tax increases on the wealthy, not the middle-class. I guess McCain is so senile, he forgot that part.|`|iKbuS3I7aa	False.  Just like everything else McCain says about him.   Have you ever really listened to one of McCains speeches?  He spends more time talking about Obama then he spends talking about what HE will do.  Pay attention sometime.   Also,  does it make you proud that Al Qaeda now endorses McCAin... It scares the crap out of me.|`|o7dXfQfRaa	Yes it's very true.  EVERY politician promise tax cuts when they're running for office.  But with Obama's spending ambitions there is NO WAY he could afford to cut taxes.  Look for what his plan was about 1 1/2 years ago.  It was less influenced by popular opinion and more of his own extreme leftist view.|`|8a3b8c2d0bf2588ca36da8204c43602caa	That is true. But McCain will also raise taxes if he got elected. Just like George Bush did after he got elected. You don't expect politicians to actually be truthful, do you? They are just like a good salesman. They'll tell you anything you want to hear to get the sale. Plus, this country (and many local governments) is so deep in debt that a tax cut across the board for every economic class of Americans would be impossible. To cut taxes drastically would just delay the inevitable. The money for the multibillion dollar wars in Iraq and Afghanistan has to come from somewhere. You can't just print more money. (Note: Actually they can just print more money. But that will just make the economic situation 10 times worse.)|`|c9bdef5bb31ceed680934e1e0696f061aa	Senator Barack Obama declared recently that he wants to reform our tax code so that it rewards work and not just wealth. We think that is a great goal if it means a simple tax system with low marginal tax rates. Unfortunately, a close inspection of Obamas proposals reveals something disquieting: he would raise marginal tax rates for many middle-income taxpayers, a bad move for anyone seeking to promote economic growth.     Although Obama is offering a new series of tax breaks, they undermine rather than improve economic incentives. First, whether or not you get those breaks will depend on your income. In Washington, taking away tax breaks as families work harder to make more money is called a phase-out. Economists have a different name for itwe call it a tax. Reducing a persons tax credit as his income goes up also reduces his incentive to earn more income.     |`|VvTdWcLSaa	  No! I don't agree with McCain, I think he will use anything to cover his own mistakes 
iVv6bFW2aa	Yes I think so, because he will undue all the harm done by Bush, in both the foreign and domestic areas. The people will develop trust in him and elect him to two terms so that he can finish the job.|`|AA10124897	We should hope that he doesn't win the 08 election. This is a bad time in America...

There are a lot of people saying they are going to vote for Obama, but they are not telling the truth.|`|4EkE8eebaa	Neither.    Obama is Osama and McCain is McPain.|`|RMbmYvPnaa	If we're lucky and people quit drinking the liberal kool aid it will be McCain.    But McCain has screwed his campaign up so much these past couple weeks I just cant fathom that happening.
iVv6bFW2aa	Obama because all the polls show him leading both in popular and electoral votes. However some states are too close to call, so we will have to hold our breath until election day. I also think Obama will win because he's the best candidate, who will reverse 8 years of Republican misrule, wars, and corruption.|`|X4MUGca9aa	I honestly don't think we can say at this point.  I truly believe this will be the closest race in election history.  I think it is way to close to tell and believe there are still many on the fence.  |`|jJsazq5Saa	Although a lot of people think Obama will be president, I have faith that the American people will not be THAT stupid to vote for him, and that McCain will win this election. (The fact that Obama was born in Kenya also helps)|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	I'd put my money on Obama. Even McCain supporters don't seem overly optimistic.|`|jMuh4xu2aa	obama will be the man, for a short time..|`|4EkE8eebaa	I hope neither win.    Obama is Osama and McCain is McPain.|`|gMRhoRKraa	Obama has won huge states, and thus has so much more electoral votes that he's obviously going to win.  |`|8WOyva84aa	McCain '08.  the wishful media is in for a rude wakeup call. it's extremely tight right now, but i believe the american people will come to their senses and protect themselves, unborn babies, their money, and their security.
AA10447191	Absolutely I am going to vote. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	Definitely I will cast my vote for Obama. I am surprised that intellectuals don't vote in India because in the USA they do tend to vote. However the USA does have one of the lowest voting participation levels in the world. This is probably because us laws are not voter friendly, and are getting more stringent by the day,thanks to the Republicans|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I am voting.    Maybe they should spend some money in India on ways to get unglued.  People may be intellectual, but they can't be too intelligent, if they criticize, but don't do anything, even the slightest thing, to change the ways things are.  Maybe they intellectual have Autism or Asperger's Syndrome, no social skills; it's not unheard of.|`|d66FcMLKaa	Heck ya the republicans have benn messin up our country i wish billclinton could be president again.|`|4EkE8eebaa	I can't vote on the president, I live in Australia.
CMmpD0OJaa	In the UK, all Telephone calls, texts, and Emails, are recorded, and saved on giant servers at GCHQ, and scanned by software designed to pick out "key" words, or groups of words, on the pretext of National Security. This information is allowed to be accessed by Groups like MI5, MI6, Special Branch, The Home Office, Local and District Councils,  The Courts, The Crown Prosecution Service, and anyone else deemed Relevant by our Government, Including Foriegn Security Agencies, like the CIA.  Of course, this is all done "For our own Protection" apparantly. Although, I've tried to work out how, exactly this is Protecting me, I must be a Retard or something, because I can't see, for the life of me, just how this works. If anyone knows, could they please let me know, because its bugging the $hit out of me.   Also, these Agencies aren't exactly very good at keeping this sensitive information safe, are they? Barely a week goes by without hearing how some MI5 Operative has left his notebook in a Cafe, or on a Train, or just plain lost it. Hard Drives are always getting found, at Car Boot sales, or on E- Bay , Or even on Landfill sites, crammed full of Sensitive information, about just about anybody, They can't even be trusted to keep this information " safe" IN THEIR OWN AGENCIES!   That is why I am an Anarchist. I see them for what they are, and I'm not about to start trusting them anytime soon. Okay?|`|AA11828439	In America it is not the police, but Federal Agencies who undertake wiretapping of dissidents. With the Patriot Act, it is more diverse than before.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, and they always have secretly and without warrants. Now it is officially permitted, because Bush's people introduced the FISA Bill. The FISA Bill exempts telecommunication companies for warrant less wire tapping, if requested by the Government. Bush has turned this country into a police state, even more than it was previously. However it's the FBI and the CIA, and not the police that does it|`|eW0MSS1uaa	Yes, but they just don't tell us. |`|BsyC4gevaa	In the USA the only department established for aggression ; including defense and protection of the citizenship was the militia, that has advanced or evolved into the military over time.    The militia and government were not permitted to violate the privacy of citizens as established in the 4th Amendment, although with the development of new agencies in the government they have not been held to the same Laws as are maintained for the government departments recognized in the Constitution.    While it is illegal to tap phones, it is also a much more non-violent deterrent of anarchy or treason, yet it is illegal.    The country and it's representatives are responsible for upholding the Constitution, or it basically is a useless document being peddled in the name of Democracy in other countries.  It is an active citizenship that follows the law that must bring this problem to the forefront of other citizens across the board in order to maintain the peace and Justice in the country. It is Justice that maintains peace.    It is the Justice system that prevents the internal destruction of the country's system as well. Liberty and Justice for all.|`|P6r2In1Iaa	Without a doubt they can and do since we are filmed in most places and there are radio spys based near where I live. And with the new Bill on Terrorism the USA insisted we have they have had a good go at turning Britain into a Police state, it is too late already they did it. Try taking a photograph of a base from a safe distance, or protest against a war outside the gates of one they will find your car and take its number plate.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	It may be that the government is wiretapping people, but not politicians in particular.  It has happened and may still be happening, but it would be looked upon with a jaundiced eye idf it were uncovered and the public found out.  It would be a prosecutorial offense.  Wiretapping politicians to maintain one's rule is frowned upon and punished in the United States.|`|TD9T9dNlaa	 The US is big on this crap now--ever since the Patriot Act |`|zEHU0E9Yaa	Define "common"...for one thing, it is a practice in the US to which the inappropriate use of Executive Privileged has been applied. This has allowed the use to be "common" in the aspect that it is an accepted practice that is still engaged.    However, the simple fact is that there is no way a small group of government employees (and, proportionally speaking, organizations like the FBI and Secret Service are small groups) are able to monitor phone calls of dissension on a widespread basis. With 70% of Americans disapproving of the current administration, there is no way 30,000 people (a recent estimation of FBI employees) can monitor 210,000,000 people effectively. That's a 7,000:1 ratio!|`|4EkE8eebaa	Queensland Police don't do it.
i1ACnt6Iaa	I'm a lower-middle class citizen who is in college and have had to work for everything I've ever gotten.  Barack Obama is much more educated and his policies are geared toward the middle class.  John McCain has no idea what it's like to struggle through life.  He admits to owning 8 houses (including condos) and upwards of 11 vehicles.  How on earth can someone with those kind of assetts relate to someone like myself who works 30 hrs a week and attends school 16 hrs a week?  Also, I'll be frank, the rich are going to get richer under McCain while the poor get poorer and the middle class continues to decline.  McCain's policies will not benefit anyone more than the richest 10%.  If you don't believe that then I would like you to find a list of wealthy CEOs, CFOs, and executives of major corporations and see who they support.  I have found over 20 of them who support McCain... I haven't found one to support Obama.  Shouldn't that tell you that McCain will benefit the richest of the rich?  If it doesn't, then I don't know what will.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because McCain is more of the same. He will continue Bush's policies, including wars, a tax system which favors the rich as well as a health plan that does the same. Oh, then there's crazy Sarah, with her Armageddon, exorcism of witches, corruption, instability and Armageddon.Obama is more level headed calmer and intelligent. He will undo the harm done by the GOP. Therefore I am voting for him.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	A vote for McCain is a vote to continue the ruination of our country and people.|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Everyone that is a taxpayer should vote for McCain.  Obama will raise everyone's taxes with his "give-away" policies.|`|cnSew7jiaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH32xpupp...|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Sarah Palin is a big reason why|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I don't know about anyone else, but I will tell you why I didn't vote for him. Yes I have already voted. John McCain does not have a platform that I can get behind. John McCain has been on the wrong side of too many policy decisions for my liking. John McCain does not have a fiscally responsible economic plan. John McCain has a terrible health care plan. John McCain has had several election year conversions where he came out saying he would support the exact of opposite of the type of bills he has consistently voted against. John McCain voted for the bailout bill. I do not trust election year political conversions and I definitely do not trust John McCain. I voted for Bob Barr and I have no regrets in this regardless of the outcome.|`|SlWjhHJnaa	Because I have never gotten a job from a poor person.  Taxing businesses will cause jobs to be lost and will be bad on the economy, History has proved it.    McCain is going to save money buy cutting spending and Obama is going to spend spend spend.|`|xwDtwVckaa	Is it just me, or is the grammer in that sentence rather telling?  |`|1Fq25obNaa	There are to many reasons to list (basically all of them).    The only reason TO vote for McCain is that it would provide an unlimited supply of ways to further ridicule the already ridiculous Republican party.    McCain would make Bush look like Eisenhower.|`|30c80fd1b17a3706bf5570a2557e2287aa	If you believe in what he is saying vote for him, if you don't believe in the guy don't vote for him.

He will lower taxes on every American, putting more money into our pockets.  He will lower corporate taxes, allowing businesses to grow and create jobs, and he will keep up safe from terrorism.|`|MKx1e0hiaa	He supports an unending war in which we spend billions of dollars on a year. He has already made clear that he feels that Iraq is not stable yet, but the thing is with the U.S. supporting Iraq as much as we are right now they arnt getting any closer either. As long as we stay in Iraq and act as a crutch for their government they will never get back up on their feet (which is what the major cooperation's want because we have control over Iraqi oil).    If you want to get a wound to heal you have to walk on it.|`|m533CIIgaa	because he's a republican.
iVv6bFW2aa	 Unfortunately he is not a Socialist and that's why intelligent capitalists like Buffet are willing to support him. The Republicans use the word Socialist  because it's a dirty word to them and they want to smear Obama, and divert from consideration of issues. Obama is mildly reformist far from socialist, and no threat to capitalism. Something on the order of FDR.|`|dc3fe56a7581454022b1e7c9fcf25878aa	Warren Buffet supporting Obama may not mean much.  Buffet may know how to avoid paying heavy income tax by various methods, so he's not afraid of Obama's tax plan.    Also, who is buying up stock right now, on the cheap?  Guys like Buffet.    Finally, Obama once ran as a member of the New Party, a socialist group.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Ignorance?  Even the wealthy have seen how bad Dub has messed up our country and know we cannot stand more of this.|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Appeal to authority--logical fallacy. Revise your understanding of philosophy and critical thinking, and formulate a question that -isn't- fallacious. |`|6kUx7fwcaa	The answer to this questions can by answered by this question:    Why is it socialism when the money of rich people is distributed to the people who pay less, but it is capitalism when the money is given back to the rich so that they spend less in taxes?    People without money have to spend money to buy things and make life a little more pleasant, but people who make a lot of money (by charging high prices for items) can save tax money by spending money to make more money and buy luxury items that are really a waste of resources?    Some people say, why should we stop profligate spending and people paying to enjoy themselves if they worked for it and people were willing to pay them.  I suppose we should just spend as much as we can make, waste our natural resources (because we have an endless supply, right), and drain everyone and everything until we reach a crisis state.  Oh, I'm sorry, you say we are in a crisis state?  How did that happen?    The same people who call Obama a socialist are the capitalists.  They think there is no problem with global warming or the use of the earth's resources or money.  Do I need to say anymore?|`|4EkE8eebaa	Because his real name is Barack Osama.|`|f2FUWG2Caa	NO OBAMA is not a socialits.NO.

They preach a sharing of the wealth so that all blacks rise economically together and none is left behind in poverty.    0bama calling for a redistribution of wealth is totally un-american!!!!!|`|ZLk4AJzWaa	The right wing attack squad will say and do anything to try and stop Obama, sinking to lies about his citizenship, his religion, hell they have even attacked his sexuality. The right are scared of losing their death grip on power and I wouldn't be surprised if they created another 911 to stop the election.|`|GZYCo6dqaa	Because they know the truth behind him and they don't want to be left out when he takes over. Keep in mind that Obama is a millionaire and no problem forking out money either. For example: BUYing TV time to address himself before Nov. 4th|`|jxUYdSLwaa	They are betting on the favorite so as to be spared from the rath of Emperor Obama.

And frankly, so much corruption is rooted in government in general, but particularly the Republican party and I refuse believe a word coming out of either their mouths.|`|QlMubgPcaa	Not to me she is not.

I cringe when I look at her crooked nose. Witch!
iVv6bFW2aa	Definitely and in many different ways. Robo calls, assaults on Obama canvassers, a racist hoax aggression by an employee of McCain's campaign, Red baiting , specifically attacks on Bill Ayers, ACORN, calling Obama Osama or Hussein, questioning the authenticity  of his birth certificate accusing him of Being a Socialist. The Republicans are using these non issues to try to win the elections. They don't want to deal with the real issues because they are afraid of defeat. The days of Joe McCarthy are back again.|`|4EkE8eebaa	Osama is saying that just to make McPain look bad, it's not necessarily true.|`|83zdK7xDaa	But Obama, as opponent of McCain has a vested interest in making McCain look bad.  Therefore, he is not a just judge of whether McCain and/or his supporters is/are doing a negative or positive campaign
iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, in the sense that he is grandiose , narcissistic, arrogant. He also has a poor hold on reality|`|pElG2K61aa	Evident desperation. McCain must put on a brave face.    John C, will you please answer the question? Spamming is against guidelines.|`|7f350f830ee31ebce51cf080a09328bdaa	Because he feels as I do that if Barry is elected our nation will go through some of the worst times since the civil war.|`|zCK40rIRaa	well, IF he believes in democracy, he has to accept the decision of the people.  |`|4EkE8eebaa	There is never any logic in American politics.
iVv6bFW2aa	Obama's policy will ease the tax burden on  the middle class and and ensure that those making $250, 000 per year pay their fair share of taxes. It's hardly a redistribution of wealth. I think Obama was way too gentle on the rich. I would have increased taxes on everyone earning over $100,000 a year, and that's pretty generous too.|`|AA11313983	The same way you're affected by Iraq.  Even if you're never going to go, I guarantee you consider yourself affected by it.|`|AA11511852	It will cause the amount that the companies that are going to pay for the new taxes to raise their price which will effect you and me.|`|4EkE8eebaa	You probably ask so many questions about American politics because they are so confusing. Well let me tell you one thing--I agree with you.|`|F1bgHAeeaa	It is a sickness that punishes the ones that are productive. No people of wealth or comfort keep their money in a personal vault. Do they? They buy things we make or invest in things so we have jobs. If you never make 250K a year, you still go to school and try hard because that is what you want to make at least 250K a year. It is America and we all dream that if not us, our children can become wealthy. But our lack of personal accountability and willingness to have big brother take care of us invokes a sick agenda to punish those who we are striving to be. The "robbinhood"  dispersement rewards those that did not succeed and punishes the ones that did- so much for motivation.  And to make your stupidity certain, we want the wealth collected by  the government knowing full well how they do with money. We all know Obama was ACORN backed but facts are not considered and his support is evidence of Americans forgetting what America should be about. The next time your in line at the department of motors or at the county recorders stop and think if this is the system you want for your children's health care?   
4EkE8eebaa	I would say A out of those two, but this one is better:    George Bush, Osama Bin Ladden, Michael Clarke and a high school student are on a crashing plane, but there are only three parachutes.     The high school student rushes to a parachute and takes off his bag to put it on, but George bush gets it first and says "I'm the most important, so I deserve to live." And then he jumps out of the plane.    Then Michael Clarke grabs a parachute and says "I have a test match against India tomorrow and I can't miss it." So he jumps out of the plane.    Osama Bin Ladden approaches the high school student and says "Well I've terrorised people and I deserve to die. You take the last parachute." The high school student says "Oh don't worry, you can be a terrorist till you die of old age or are executed! George Bush used my bag."|`|GeQ5XEKJaa	C.biden on watching fdr in 29 on television.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	A, B, and the pig in lipstick|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Just interview Plain pig with a 'libstick' - you will have a handful of best jokes for years to come..|`|u93eagkqaa	Someone needs to tell me exactly what the vice president does..|`|8RflQ9DVaa	I apologize.

Dreams are funny, aren't they?|`|GHusBLjgaa	Well seeing how Al Gore won the Nobel Prize for being the sole defender of humanity against man bear pig, and for his science fiction movie An Inconvenient Truth, I guess anything is possible.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	you must have been stoned|`|jftJypfMaa	Hahahahahaa, Wow ! what ya been eatin before bed time.   Jeezzzzz ! What a silly dream....|`|82d10b303e74dbe6accab663bbcd07b2aa	Hahaha.. That was definitely a Dream, Geyamala.   It the most absurd proposition to think a man such as he would be celebrated in such fashion. |`|4EkE8eebaa	Don't worry Geyamala, it's not too late. You can seek proffessional help now.|`|0086b09608c18cf4e39e2f5ad539ddcfaa	Thankfully that was just a dream. I doubt, sincerely, that that is even a likelihood, considering him.|`|9fWRDzyZaa	Sure there is hope for that, I mean hey Jimmy Carter received one! LOL
iVv6bFW2aa	The recession is already here, compliment of Bush. Since John MC SAME is following Bush's policies he will make the recession worse, not Obama. |`|3tNTOtc4aa	It's just propaganda on McCain's part. He'll say anything at this stage because he knows he's on a losing ticket.  Obama's economic manifesto is merely redistributing the wealth to make sure that the poor and underprivileged have a decent shot at life. 
AA11284831	2 wars.      Economy in a shambles.      Record deficit -- greater than the combined deficits of ALL administrations in the history of the nation COMBINED.    EXTREMELY divided nation.      Lack of respect in the international community.      Urine and fecal stains on The Constitution.      Several hundred detainees at Gitmo, some of whom are known to be INNOCENT of any crime, but still are detained.    What more could a new President ask for?|`|bmCInR5qaa	An economy in depression.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Victory in Iraq and a recovering economy.

6112fce921c5789ff47b05c280e49bffaa	Yes and his running mate will be that genius who claimed she was beaten up by Obama supporters.|`|zkovxRseaa	no, but who he endorses will be the key to who wins|`|flrOp5YLaa	No, he'll be Sarah Palin's VP pick.|`|624819025a1f31742d219ded12b3fadaaa	OMG this joe the plumber thing makes me so mad...i mean what the heck..what did this man ever do to earn all this airtime on tv...to answer your question No, i do not think he will.|`|AA12309873	No, he'll be Palin's running mate. They'll be running on the ticket of the newly formed Maverick Party.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	First of all, the guy's name is actually Sam.    Second, he will be the presidential candidate when they elect the Power Puff girls as vice president.    People in th USA can tell the difference between real and cartoon characters, even though they are treated the same on television and in the news.  News is selected for entertainment value, after all.|`|pDU0F2QDaa	I'd rather it be Wurzelberger than Palin.    I'd rather it be Romney than all of the above.|`|9TdpLbtlaa	I think I like Joe's tax plan better than Obummer's!!!|`|4EkE8eebaa	I hope not.|`|AA10853557	"Joe the Plumber".... the Mcclain campaign set Obama up  to do smears. They on the bottom of the barrel now since they  are so desperate and scare........|`|A3UftwH9aa	That is if he is able to avoid jail time for tax evasion.  Of course, not even a convicition is enough to dissuade Ted Stevens from halting his reelection bid for the Senate so I suppose it wouldn't keep Joe from following his own aspirations.  After all, the GOP welcomes crooks into its fold with open arms.
MEReSvZeaa	The UN does not and should not decide foreign policy.    When the people of the world become directly affected by our policies, then and only then can they have a vote.  At the moment, rightfully, only the American people get to decide our policy.    If I were president, I would take a look at the fact that the general assembly in the UN for the most part hates America, and I would always consider doing the exact opposite of anything they vote on regarding the US.  THAT would put us squarely on the side of those voting in America's favor, and that's good foreign policy.|`|V8yR8BU1aa	Actually I can't really think of anyone else but America that still has an embargo on Cuba.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	yup|`|8MUkunBiaa	We can expect Fidel Castro, Hugo Chavez, Kim Juang Ill, Bill Ayers, Louis Farrakahn, Rev. Wright and other socialists, communists, terrorists and people that hate America to be his top advisors.  Lifting the embargo to Cuba is obvious and a minor problem.|`|TH5B8uauaa	why shouldn't he|`|c3vPZfghaa	There is no reason why it shouldn't have been done a long time ago.  I think a decade of living the way they are, Cubans learned their lesson.  After that, it is just being cruel to the people.  Its not like Fidel was going to take over America ot anything.
10TrzsSraa	The two most obvious ways were:    1. McCain demonstrated horrendous decision making ability.   2. She negates any effective argument by McCain about experience.    Additional factors;    3. She appears to be corrupt to many independents  4. Her lack of education makes Bush look like a genius.|`|MEReSvZeaa	She improved McCain's chance and helped eliminate Obama's.|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Sarah  Palin  helped  expose  Obama  and  made him  look  weak  and  cowardly.    |`|ctcCPMdCaa	By being a mockery of everything that is intelligent and rational.    Oh and witchcraft.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	I don't think she has. In fact, I think her straight forward and not politically correct slams are starting to help McCain. Frankly, I like her. Great choice. She is indeed a pit bull with lipstick.|`|64SObnr5aa	It could be said that McCain is somewhat of a uniter.  He is a maverick, who sometimes goes against the status quo.    Palin is a divider that is a zealot.    The people want change, if McCain could have stayed on track and not chosen a divider, he may have won the election.    Palin almost assured his loss.    I said this would happen back when many were celebrating her choice, and now I have seen many have backed off, even some to the point were they are shocked by her choice.    Peace  Jim    .|`|AA10689763	by agreeing to be McCain's VP |`|AA11086243	she doesn't reach out to independents... she just stirs up the loyalists    McCain could have picked someone who did reach out to independents much more...    and really... the independents could make a huge difference...|`|v5otljOxaa	I do not believe Sarah Palin improved Obama's chances.  Must have been McCandyCane.|`|sRryRg77aa	By being inexperienced.    By being absolutely out to lunch on foreign policy.    By being an arrogant liar.    By being so far to the right she alienated everyone but the base.    This would have been a much closer race had he picked someone else.  Anyone else.|`|orWTQ9eNaa	She smears and continues to smear Obama with lies and doesn't realize that she involves McCain.  She has no answers to issues and she is not very bright.      Obama/Biden 2008|`|AA10356921	By opening her mouth...and letting her ignorance flow out of it. |`|NcwhoXSwaa	Looks bleak but I still voted for McClain and Palin.   By being the first female to be running for the secondt highest Office in the United States. That alone should speak for itself. |`|AA10071482	 By proving McCain is a very stupid man  Who in their right mind would choose a running mate they  knew close to nothing about|`|oIyfkN1aaa	by opening her mouth and not watching over her daughter..hahaha.|`|i9conSTBaa	by being a hackey mam gosh-darn you betcha!|`|9Hwb0L2yaa	Just because he is winning right this second, doesn't mean that he will.  His polls started dropping when he placed the ad to take the day off of work on Tuesday.  Does he not realize that no one can afford to do that right now?|`|zcvs5iZMaa	One example is when she stated that she was wearing duds from her favorite consignment shop in Alaska.  Ironically, she let all the undecided voters realize that it is a good thing to tighten up...pinch pennies...etc.  Hmmm...just like Obama said would be necessary to fix this screwed up economy.  I have to thank her for that.|`|1ARXZajMaa	She is very inexperienced and she did say some not-so-presidential things. She contradicted McCain on a few issues.  On the other hand, she balances McCain's ticket and attracts the more conservative voters, as well as women who originally wanted to vote for Hillary.|`|GTkKN0KFaa	By proving to moderate Republicans and centrist Democrats, people who would have considered voting for McCain, that he sold his soul to ultra conservatives and does not possess the bravery to be his own guy.  If McCain was the guy he claimed to be in 2000 he would be very electable right now.  Palin ended that.  If the Democrats capture 60 seats in the Senate, a reasonably possible outcome, we can attribute that to a Palin effect also.  America has tired of Republican extremists.
6ELSwKKvaa	 The overall state of the world at the moment has increased the chances of Obama winning. Everything is bad at the moment and Obama is running a positive campaign. People are looking for hope and for positive messages and he is giving it to the people. We need a ray of hope and he is able to do that. McCain has not been able to create a feeling of hope in the population.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	In the sense that people now finally understand what 8 years of Bush's conservative policies have done to the economy of the U.S. and the world, yes.  It has finally jolted Americans out of greed mode and started us thinking about how the country could be different, and better.|`|SngOU70Baa	yes, McCain was actually winning before the economic collapse. After, he never regained the lead|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	I honestly think it did.  He was pretty even with McCain in the polls until the bank collapse.  |`|bK5MJCxhaa	Yeah.  I think that's pretty much been established by...well...everyone.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Without a doubt. his is because Obama has proposed some good solutions, whereas McCain is just repeating stale and warmed over Bush policies. No American would swallow these because they induce nausea and vomiting|`|ss0vy4tFaa	yes, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's going to. |`|Mifqffguaa	Yes, somewhat.  His odds still reamain very low.|`|afkygHMgaa	yes, i believe it did|`|jWNcZ0zBaa	It has a big part because it's caused by the way Bush ran the country, and McCain only plans to continue that legacy.....A vote for McCain, is a vote for BUSH.|`|DBu1AzjHaa	absolutely|`|YkZm5VWhaa	I decided on Obama about a year ago.|`|YY0AwxBAaa	Perhaps.  But when Obama let slip to Joe the Plumber that he wants to spread the wealth as in a socialist state, the tide is starting to go out.|`|YH2rr9D3aa	Yes, it scared people and they think that some sort of change will make everything alright.  Which it won't, not with his plans.|`|Udy9HDiAaa	6JGFJFGHHG|`|XmSqP1Gqaa	Yes.  The sad part is that it was the democrats (Carter, Clinton, Frank, Dodd) that caused this mess and obamas policies are not the solution.|`|YIzTQMgTaa	No. The tsunami and Obama are unrelated|`|tNAGQzNnaa	No - but the media's spin on it did|`|6zo7eKT5aa	Yup.|`|xXiFLGEMaa	I think it did,  because when polled most people thought Obama would handle the economy's problems better than McCain.|`|Mug9SQjWaa	Yes, the middle class caused the evil tsunami and Obama believes he can save them.|`|9lQsCa3Faa	Yes, but it was a democratic year anyway. Every time the economy tanks, the American people elect Democrats. This should tell republicans something about their philosophy.|`|9f29214b43ea0ec7920b9578e8c01e82aa	No, both candidates had the chance to propose their solutions.  It may turn out that Obama just did a more convincing job.|`|5RkoMPdRaa	Definitely. Because People are too stupid to look at the big picture, they only look at what's happening now and assume whoever is in charge caused it.|`|EnntM7lJaa	Actually, if you were paying attention, you'd have read that he was third greatest benefactor from the graft (the top two were Democrats also).|`|3uPLnzSiaa	in my opinion, yes. The one thing the Republicans were consistantly respected on was economics. Then when the market went down the drain, people started saying that it was the policies of deregulation that did it. McCain could've had any economic policies in the world and he would still be tied to Bush's failed ones.
ebrlN6TXaa	The rest of the world is sick of Bush ... and see McCain as more of the same.  |`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	You just answered your own question. Because they believe that Obama will be handing out money to the rest of the poor and marginalized people over there too. Wouldn't surprise me.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	The socialists support him because he agrees with them.  The Islamist extremists support him because they believe he is weak and will not oppose them.|`|NAFBX5mDaa	Because Comrade Obama says it's good to spread the wealth around =)|`|AA11626262	His views seem to resonate with their own. That's why they're so gung-ho about him. Heck, they probably wish they could have him as their president.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	They must be confused, because Obama is just as much about war and intervention as the "conservatives".      A Republicrat|`|phjQGyDYaa	Because they blame their problems on America and can't wait to see it fall apart.     Can't blame them too much, if I had to work a costumer service job talking to Americans who can't figure out how to install windows every day, I'd be an Obama supporter too.|`|3YRrGfkiaa	Actually, it's pretty much everyone,  I don't know where you got the idea that it's only "oppressed and marginalized people."|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	america has been known to take many hard stances toward international politics and diplomacy.  obama has offered a boiled carrot and no stick, so they see much softer undertones to his rhetoric than they would expect with mccain.  it might even help when they all ask for a trillion more dollars to help their underprivileged nations.|`|OmZIFGBkaa	The whole world wants Obama! He is good for the world! They are tired of Bush and his losers and McCain is one of them!|`|uRulL6xyaa	They just want to come in United States for free because they're  thinking that USA  is printing money all the time. LOL|`|AA12037238	Ughhh...Maybe because they want to chop our infidel heads off and blow us up and do bad things to our women and children. That's why our Men and Women are over there so that these oppressed and marginalized people don't come here and fill our country with more crap, plus our leftist liberals are doing a great job of that already.    Sad thing is that alot of people forgot about  091101.|`|vsGsBpYUaa	When it comes to the US election, I don't give a rat's patoot what they think as their opinions on the matter are irrelevant.|`|bccc784e462841d316800601e52f1fb9aa	Why are so many losers in this country pulling for BO. It's because they're living on hope. That's all many have to depend on. 
iVv6bFW2aa	A, B C D E F, also because he is pro choice|`|438e26d7b22965d7e9bbd6ed05be2455aa	i'd say G: because he plans a giant socialistic wealth redistribution that helps the lower and middle class at the expense of the upper class.|`|EF5ff4VLaa	Me?     D, E, F. |`|5Mtgcqilaa	His principles and values do not match mine in anyway.|`|AA12037238	Dream on... You will be lucky if he delivers one thing, maybe F.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I choose G, because I would like to have someone who is thinking beyond short-term benefits and looking at long-term costs.  I see Obama as more a negotiator and Republicans as knee jerk reactionaries whose only way of winning an argument, or an election, is to insult others, start a fight, or make ridiculous divisive statements.
phjQGyDYaa	The "reverse Bradley affect" has never, ever been observed any form of election, ever.     It's an invention of the media, just like Barak Obama's campaign. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	I think it would happen to some extent. Perhaps persons living in Republican counties who might feel intimidated if they admitted that they were voting for Obama , also some persons who are members of families that are pro McCain, to avoid conflict. I think to some extent there will be some Bradley effect voters, but not too many, I hope.|`|AA10265144	You'll find out.|`|zXq4NYXvaa	It's been 26 years since that Bradley election and it was for governor.  Let's we have matured and evolved enough as human beings, to be beyond that.|`|Rh2ge7ajaa	Possibly. Obama will win with or without those "johnny come lately" votes.|`|vRMVwyCnaa	never know and i think you look cute in your fire hat dont worry about that girl she is probably just as ugly on the out side as she is on the inside.|`|QzIMP6Jdaa	No.    Obama will win. And the effect will be called Obama effect.|`|4iwqpZuraa	Possibly, I can see that happening. |`|WW0hdHKeaa	I think so, and I am predicting  a landslide victory for Obama for that reason. There are so many people who are ashamed to admit that they are voting for Barack Obama.. But when they get in that private voting booth, things will change...     VOTE FOR CHANGE!|`|lQFJMnVpaa	I think so--especially in areas where people feel intimidate to say they're voting for McCain (like areas where signs are trashed and have racial slurs written on them and Obama is hung in effigy).    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fyGH-n93r...
23A8A04Caa	No.  The most you can expect is that he will open up dialogue with other countries, instead of automatically saying the are evil.  He will be more like Clinton was.  However, I guess that is pretty radical compared to what Bush has been doing the last 8 years.|`|BovpXrk1aa	ask not what your country can do for you  DEMAND IT    GIVE ME / GIVE / GIVE ME|`|flrOp5YLaa	Radical?  Maybe not.  I hope he can improve our relationships with other countries.  He wants to end the war in Iraq responsibly.  That should help.|`|hiCSVwchaa	If you consider getting the troops out of Iraq radical....    The Bush administration has had talks with North Korea, a nuclear armed terrorist sponsor.    I don't understand why Obama gets crap for saying he'd talk to Iran.|`|AA11280073	We will go back to diplomacy and working with our allies. I wouldn't call that radical. No more war mongering.|`|4Aauh87yaa	There won't really be much change at all. Obama has to say what he has to say to get elected, but he won't really be able to do anything differently IF he gets elected.|`|4uike3ARaa	I certainly hope so.   I, for one, am disgusted and ashamed for the directions the current President has taken this country vis a vis his 'foreign policy.'|`|fSlZQzS4aa	Probably|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Change, but not radical. |`|ss0vy4tFaa	america's enemies are obama's buddies|`|b32jC7pGaa	We can expect our relationships with other countries to be a lot better. If that's radical, then it's GOOD radical.|`|u8WyN7cHaa	"come to america   bomb us  and we kiss your @ss!"|`|Jwd5uIVwaa	No. Nothing will change "radically". I hope alot of things ARE changed, like resuming trade with Cuba, but nothing moves that quickly. Nothing.|`|v6WHh9POaa	Not "if" but "when" and yes...yes we can.|`|2AVqdxwyaa	Yes we are in GIANT trouble if even the French are calling him immature.

There won't be much to stop him, with a Democrat congress.|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	probably,since obama can't make decisions and he wants to be every ones friend looks like our foreign policy will be a joke|`|6UQ8IFXLaa	No radical changes, but something less than radical.  Enough change to satisfy the voters.  We cannot remain the policeman of the world.  We also cannot continue the amounts of foreign aid we are giving away now.  We need more focus on our infrastructure health care and education.|`|aPKW0ljVaa	no, once elected business will continue as usual, he's already made concessions to be seen as a moderate. he will read the speaches he is told to read, sit at the end of the table and wave to the public.  |`|8BINzk8saa	There will be change, I wouldn't call it radical (even Bush sat down and talked with Iran's leader (I'm not even going to try to spell his name)) he is viewed very favorably by the international community, so maybe we wouldn't be hated everytime we go to Europe.|`|99McDR6qaa	Absolutely and rapidly and then start bending over so you can kiss your behind good by
AA11601031	If by "glamour" you mean stupidity, then, yes.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Nah...Sarah Palin is a walking yeast infection.|`|gRtmFa1maa	Well, a hockey mom with one knocked up teenager daughter whose preparing to marry her high school drop out fiance, her oldest son is a  high school drop out who was forced into the military by his parents because they couldn't control him. Glamour isn't the word that comes to mind when I think of Sarah Palin.  You can take the girl out of the trailer park, but you can't take the trailor park out of the girl.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	More down home middle America than anything else! Good for her! Palin 2012!|`|f7c5f574e4f1a6efb425246391dcb433aa	I don't see the glamour but I do see a little glimmer she is more blue coller to me though|`|QzWHMGHJaa	 humor, not glamor  she's a total joke!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I really don't find her attractive, because she is very primitive, cheap looking, stupid and vulgar, nasty and unethical. However she would look better if she took of those ugly glasses. If the RNC bought her some contact lenses it would be a much better investment than the $150,000 dress. Rather than glamour,she adds vulgarity to the ticket. She will cause McCain to lose the election by even more votes.|`|Y3ZAtgkXaa	It didn't.    "glamour"?    lipstick on a pig|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	ewwwwww God no......|`|8RflQ9DVaa	No. More like a touch of HeeHaw.|`|AA11517536	No, but it did add a lot of fodder for comedians.|`|f7a27dc3bf1ef3fa5b6d27e18088be8eaa	McCain was a bit jealous, so he decide to get his own Celebrity to his ticket.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	Yes.  She is so pleasant and I would trust her to be president.  You liberals are a hateful bunch.  |`|WaaFCtuOaa	It brought more humour than glamour.  Watch all the late shows & Saturday Night Live.  Every time Sarah speaks, it more funny material for Jay Leno, Letterman, Bill Maher, Jon Stewart & others to talk about|`|RcCJSSMPaa	No. |`|Y5OsB9Bnaa	I didn't know being a redneck was glamorous.      So, if I buy myself 6 cans of SPAM and a couple things of Jiffy-Pop and talk with a funny accent...I'm like Frank Sinatra?|`|YkZm5VWhaa	She added a touch of moronic ignorance.|`|ge1C7alfaa	More like slapstick comedy than touch of glamor. |`|CUVYxMF1aa	I think so.|`|bMtBtYDsaa	 Palin is an honest,caring woman....she has added many things to this election......|`|So8yzf8Maa	It showed McCains desperation and lowered the GOP bar. She is from the Meth Capital of America and exudes a trailer trash aura.|`|fe1FiF0Paa	I think it added a bit of bubble headed blondness!!!|`|12984593ea7093cf70b5e4ea31b4bb24aa	As much as chicks laying across the hood of cars add to calenders.    It was a poor attempt by Mccain to get woman's votes.   Unfortunately I don't think most woman are that stupid.   He could easily have found someone more qualified, but maybe not as glamourous.|`|ss0vy4tFaa	all you got to do is attend one of the palin rallies and you'll see that ladies from all walks of life are fired up about her. |`|5f10f43dd261bb589b76eb80cb9c78a9aa	I got to say...I'm voting for Obama/Biden. I'm very liberal, very democrat. BUT...I do think that Palin was (and is) good for this country. She's very real. She seems to speak her mind and say what she is thinking. From a political standpoint, that's so nice to see (even if I may not agree with her). As far as I'm concerned, good for her...and I wish her the best of luck if things don't workout for them next week.|`|2BdxLgO4aa	Sure. Glamourous Redneck chicks sure do add a sparkle to things.  Bedazzling even.|`|AA11089392	I wouldn't say glamour is something Sarah Palin adds to the race for President/Vice-President. She isn't ugly but not terrible attractive either. Certainly not glamourous.   If you ask her, what she brings to the race is her foreign policy experience since she is governor of a State that borders Canada and 90 miles from Russia. Fortunately she was kind enough to point out that these are foreign countries. The other thing she seems to think she brings is experience in energy policy since she is the governor of an energy producing State.  Glamour or not I would hate to see her one 72 year old heart beat away from the Presidency. We have endured enough shame and embarassment and mismanagment in that office in the last 8 years.|`|QzOCkKGjaa	Yes she "glamourized" the fact that she had $150,000 to burn on overpriced clothes.....sh*t that money could have gone to buy 2 or even 3 houses in the south for some people that lost their homes....or that money could have gone to help fund schools....but NOOOO it went to Versace and Louis Vitton|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Maybe a touch but more importantly, she brought in a fresh, untainted by Washington good ole boy politics way of showing the country and the world that anyone can do whatever they aspire to if they wish to.  She has demonstrated such grace and poise by not letting comments like many of the Palin haters make on here deter or bother her.

She is at the very least, deserving of our respect.|`|99dff2b4eb654e1bc68f6c9d3f2d607eaa	Well, yes, it did, fashionably speaking.  Since her clothing and hairstyling were all "glamorous", then yes.    But her Joe Six Pack dialogue, her low down appeals to red hate and her lack of actual political knowledge brought things down to a kind of Hatfields and McCoys level.      I hardly call that glamorous.    I wonder who she really is.  Is she as mean as it appears?  As all those ex associates proclaim? As her own words indicate?  If so, yikes!    As for all the "She's a woman" and "She's a babe" votes, a woman candidate is not always a women's candidate.
bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No she does not. You are totally correct.  http://www.politicalcompass.org/usprimar...  Calling Obama a socialist is insulting the intelligence of the American people    All the campaign talk and media chatter about "socialism" obscures the most fundamental issue: Socialism is not merely a set of technical measures involving state intervention into the economy. All capitalist nations engage in this to one degree or another, depending on circumstances. State ownership does not in any sense define a society as socialist, when the state itself is an organ of class rule controlled by the financial aristocracy.    Socialism means the reorganization of economic life under the democratic control of the actual producers, the working people whose labor creates all wealth. It can come about only through the independent political mobilization of the working class, led by a revolutionary party, which establishes a new and far more democratic form of state, a workers' state, which exercises ownership and control over the means of production. Socialism cannot be engineered through backroom deals between Wall Street bankers and Washington politicians, or through the policies of any Democratic or Republican politician.|`|grBxTsK6aa	The state of Alaska has a permanent fund from where they pay out checks to all citizens....socialism.

Not so good when it's by force.|`|0VZ8zxkVaa	Calling obama a right wing leader? Only a rabid communist would call obama right-winged. Being right-winged is supposed to mean you want small and limited government. When was the last time obama wanted to eliminate a government program and agency. Obama will maintain the status quo and will increase government intervention and wealth distribution, he is a socialist, no doubt.    For that matter, Palin is actually pretty socialist too. |`|EIFX90WRaa	stop trying to play games with technical language.  For all practical purposes the guy is a socialist.  You should embrace what you believe rather than try to dilute it in this manner.|`|99dff2b4eb654e1bc68f6c9d3f2d607eaa	Yes, truly, as Hillary recently pointed out, political terms have been twisted and distorted until "conservatives", once considered to be for "small government" are now condoning the government taking away our civil rights.  Bush has seized more political power than any other prez, just ripping our constitution to shreds.  And this is small government?  I guess in a way it is cause behind it is HUGE business.  And they are really the ones in charge.    So many terms.  In fact, Democracy is supposed to be what we are bringing to the world and our Democracy has long embraced certain forms of Socialism which is why our Capitalistic Society has not perished.  Remember, the richest are the richest because they are dedicated to being the richest.  They are not dedicated to ending childhood poverty -  to bettering education.  But why?  Why are the richest so incredibly short sighted?  Ironically, we are condoning change for their own good as well as ours, for America as well as the world.    This misconstruing of the term Socialism as evil is ridiculous.  Would all those people terrified of that term prefer the term Fascist?  Because that describes the current administration far more aptly than Socialist describes Obama.    The best description for the politics Obama supports?  American.  Politics of Unity.|`|4EkE8eebaa	Well good on them for laughing AT Sarah Palin, not WITH her.|`|bHI4NLonaa	I don't even know how to respond to this question. you are just wrong on so many levels that you look like a fool.

1c25f0773926f8cde3f71d5867bbbc1eaa	In a fantasy world where Palin should pit against McCain, I would vote for McCain, because McCain is a sensible moderate compared to a nutcase religious extremist that Palin is.      However, McCain's presidential hopes are finished after this.  Palin will try to run again in 2012 for president.  There is a good chance that GOP could end up cracking up over this, the moderates breaking away from the extremists. Don't expect McCain to be rooting for her in 2012.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Ron Paul.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	That would be an impossible choice, in any case they are both running together McCain for President, Palin for  Vice President. If they ran against each other, and there was no other choice like Obama, and I was forced to vote I would find McCain a somewhat less evil candidate. She is a religious fanatic, pro war, anti choice, very intolerant and even more of a Red/Muslim baiter than McCain. of all the above issue McCain is somewhat less strident and fanatical., and somewhat less hostile to the Democrats But it's an impossible choice|`|5hxWSezPaa	They are on the same ticket!  There is no contest between them and could not be.|`|UoGFo3Dhaa	Obama.  Because republicans are idiots.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	What?

3tNTOtc4aa	It's because so much of what happens in America is based on anachronistic and outdated traditions and laws such as the right to bear arms (fine in the wild west and for the frontiersmen but not for a civilised 21st Century society) and the Electoral College voting system which cost Al Gore the 2000 election and thus plunged the the United States into the Iraq War debacle.|`|mdKkqvkDaa	Have you read the constitution?  You remember that document they tried to get you to read in the 7th grade but was too lazy to do so?  That same document that gives you all the freedoms you enjoy everyday.  Imperfect as it is it's still the best form of government on the planet. |`|AA10118655	First, you need to remember that the President is not elected by the People. He/she is elected by the electoral college. Each state determines how it will select it's electors, and currently, all states use the popular vote, but this is not required.    The electors meet in their state on Dec 15 this year to select one person for President and one person for Vice President. The results are sent to Washington D.C., where a joint session of Congress is held on Jan 6, and they tally up the electoral votes for President. The person with the majority (over 50%) will then be certified as the President elect. They then do the same for the Vice President vote.    |`|c23478f3a6f6ccbb83145c92645bca1aaa	WELCOME TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!|`|rHNQFVMvaa	Its a very wise law.  In the past (when the Constitution was written), the delay allowed time to tabulate the results of an election and for the new President to set their affairs in order before leaving for D.C..  Now, it allows time to choose staff, decide on some basic policy, and smooth the transition of power.  It also ensures that there will be adequate time to resolve a contested election (theoretically) while someone is still in charge.  Can you imagine what would have happened if the law required a new President on, say the second week in November in 2000?|`|706923d60f2f71ebae89f975ca070066aa	Because that is what the Constitution says.     When it was written, Election day was set so it came after the fall harvest and before the winter snow. about 5-6 weeks were set aside for ballots to be collected from all over the countryside and be counted, for each State legislature to meet to apportion their electoral votes and for those electors to travel to Washington DC to cast their votes.  Then word had to be spread around the country and prepare for the inauguration about a month later, again allowing time to travel in the winter weather.    It made sense then for practical reasons. And now, the government is so large and complex it takes several months to get everyone in place to start the new administration.|`|M1u3IhFFaa	  Transition of power takes time; it doesn't happen overnight.  National security is at stake and the new president will have a lot to learn, especially this one.|`|4zbzyaPHaa	I think it is better this way.  Obama will have a chance to catch up with everything going on before he takes over.  This provides for a smooth transition.  The old administration is starting to work with members of the new administration.  Everyone will be on the same page before any changes are made.  I think this help ensures that a new president doesn't come in and start messing around with serious issues and prevents a new president from causing serious harm from the beginning.  This also ensures that any mistakes made in the first months of the new presidency cannot be blamed on poor preparation.

It's been over for a while, maybe now people will notice, and Conservatives will stop supporting Liberals that pose as Conservatives, or as the "Lesser of two evils". |`|CW8ah4Wgaa	No.    The only real differences between "liberals" and "conservatives" right now is their opinions an wedge issues.    Wedge issues like abortion and gay marriage and gun control occasionally pop up in national discussion after the election, but are back burnered just as quickly.    Wedge issues are a campaign tactic (obviously not a good one) and the campaigns are over.

Let me make it clear what was done:    1)  In the 1990's, home ownership was artificially made to go up, as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were ordered to accept mortgages from those who were not able to repay those mortgages.  2)  Because of the newfound ability of citizens to purchase homes (even though they could not afford them), prices of homes went up dramatically (see:  Supply and Demand - Basic Principal of Economics).  3)  People started defaulting on their homes  4)  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could not cover the defaults  5)  Demand for homes dropped dramatically, reducing costs and bursting the bubble (again - see Supply and Demand)  6)  We are where we are    Please explain what part of this Bush is responsible for.  I would love to know.  This was caused by Democrats rejecting oversight on Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae (see:  John McCain/Chuck Hagel asking for oversight) and acting like there was no problem.    Then, when the problem came to fruition, the Dems placed blame on the Republicans (aided by a willing MSM).      Stupid people assigned blame to Bush.    Welcome to the Future.|`|tU912Cawaa	yes|`|3lur9XHOaa	Yes and no....it does relate to Bush but I have yet to see where Bush's policies have put us into a recession.

For six years America was economically sound despite having two war fronts.  Nobody wants to see that our economy went south when Pelosi and Reid gained control of Washington.  You probably didn't notice because the liberal media was too busy bashing Bush for their( Pelosi,Reid) poor leadership.

You'll have Obama, who is, without exaggeration and quite literally a Marxist as president along with Harry and Nancy in the Congress. America will be one of the most 'leftist' nations in the world.     I never thought I would see America come to this. Never thought I would see America move so far from the vision of independence, self reliance, self sufficiency and freedom that the founding fathers created. Amazing. I never thought I'd ever see a people so eager for a suckle up to a government teat or look to the government to be their virtual mommy and protect them from the big bad world. It's pathetic. It really is. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	In so far as there would be less repression which wold enable us to act with greater freedom, and in addition people would be less intimidated o join our struggle. Obama could be pushed further to the let because he wouldn't have to engage in political posturing to appeal to the center and the right.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	Well not democratic forces but certainly far left ideology would be strengthened..|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	I think it would set the Republicans back on their heels after so many years of rule.  I think that's a good thing as they drifted too far to the right for the country.  Its not just Obama though, if the Dems pick up many seats, it will return the voice of the common man to the consideration of Congressional lawmakers.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	I heard an NPR show today that pointed out that Democrats have been more effective in holding costs and balancing the federal budget than the Republicans, have have spent heavily for national defense but failed to make the USA feel safer.  Reagan left office with a huge deficit and Bush is leaving us with an enormous deficit.  Clinton left us with a drop in that deficit.  Republicans argue that their policies set up the conditions to relieve the deficit, but then why is it that for a second time in a row the Republicans are leaving us with one, yet the Democrats, who are always accused of being spendthrifts and big government spender balance the budget?  Liberalism, socialism, and conservatism are meaningless concepts as far as I can see because the predictions people make based on those labels fail to be seen in reality.  Obama is going to put money in the pockets of people who will spend it in such a way that many people are likely to benefit.  Many people fail to benefit from the trickle down approach.  Republicans rail against the immigrants who steal the jobs, but the people they give the money to hire illegal immigrants to work for them.  I think the world has gone crazy and no longer makes sense, and these words no longer help. |`|6B3ojD2Laa	No, far lefties will continue to say that democrats and republicans are too similar and that Obama is compromising too much, so they will remain frustrated and will continue to criticize the US President and congress for being so right wing. They see democrats just about as right wing as repubs.  I don't get these people that say Obama is far left. That's a very narrow view and quite a stretch.

NrKj9KgPaa	It certainly is a shame, but hardly unexpected when one considers that the great mudslinger champion (Karl Rove) is advising the McCain campaign. Nothing is too dirty if it might be effective, and shame is a dirty word (unless applied to their adversary).    From the 'horse's mouth' so to speak:  >> Dr Peter Millican, a philosophy don at Hertford College, Oxford, has devised a computer software program that can detect when works are by the same author by comparing favourite words and phrases.   He was contacted last weekend and offered $10,000 (6,200) to assess alleged similarities between Obamas bestseller, Dreams from My Father, and Fugitive Days, a memoir by William Ayers.   ***   The offer to Millican to prove that Ayers wrote Obamas book was made by Robert Fox, a California businessman and brother-in-law of Chris Cannon, a Republican congressman from Utah. He hoped to corroborate a theory advanced by Jack Cashill, an American writer.  Fox and Cannon each suggested to The Sunday Times that the other had taken the initiative.  Cannon said that he merely recommended computer testing of the books. He doubted whether Obama wrote his autobiography, adding: If Ayers was the author, that would be interesting.  Fox said he had hoped that Cannon would raise the $10,000 to run a computer test. It was Congressman Cannon who initially pointed me in that direction and, from our conversation, I thought he might be able to find someone [to raise the $10,000].  He believed that if proof of Ayerss involvement was provided by an Oxford academic it would be political dynamite.  Fox contacted Millican, who said: He was entirely upfront about this. He offered me $10,000 and sent me electronic versions of the text from both books.  Millican took a preliminary look and found the charges very implausible. A deal was agreed for more detailed research but when Millican said the results had to be made public, even if no link to Ayers was proved, interest waned.   http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/wo...     |`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Thank God McCain committed to run a clean campaign.

dJnRFpWWaa	National polls indicate that Barack Obama leads John McCain by 13 percentage points as of yesterday. In the ten individual battleground states, Obama leads or is tied with McCain in every single one, and new polls suggest that Obama is within 6% points in Georgia and that McCain's lead in Mississippi and South Carolina have dropped down to single digits as we speak.    That means that Obama will take a majority of the battleground states, all of which McCain must win to become President, and he is poised to take one or more of the most deeply Republican states in the Union.    Obama is winning the election for President, the Democrats are winning the race for the US Senate, and the Democrats are winning the race for the US HOuse of Representatives. Handily.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	Obama is going to win. the polls suggest he is leading by 13%. all the right thinking, progressive, anti war people  in the world are supporting him. eminent economists like Paul Krugman, Dr. Amartya sen support him because of his stand on tax policy, health care policy.|`|DJjLMbV5aa	No one, since we haven't started counting ballots.

It was shown that under any group experience where all people work for the common good, there will be slackers.I answered this a few days ago.  Think of your own experience with siblings.   I did the dishes four times this week she hasn't done anything!  This plays out in households all over   America. It is a family problem. Magnify it.  It was decided that individual chores and private property was the most beneficial in the group experience.  This is what built the American system of earnings, people are entitled to what they earn.  Nobody has the right to "share another''s salary". If you didn't earn it , you aren't entitled to it.  I can donate to a cause, but my money cannot be confiscated.I have the right to ownership of the fruits of my own labor. I understand that I will pay taxes to suply monies for an army and for infrastructure and law enforcement. I understand states rghts and the necessity to provide education and emergency care for those who cannot care for themselves, but the rest is voluntary.  Those who do not work ,do not eat.  ah, the birth of Capitalism You could earn as much or as little as you wanted but you were responsible for your own existence.|`|KcAehrrKaa	I think you want it to be.|`|e2tE6EI8aa	GREED WILL ULTIMATELY END WHAT OUR COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED UPON...|`|7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	Comrade, Communism failed.

It's a trained anarchy. Read the Communist Manifesto, instead of spouting ignorance. And, to answer your question: no. Americans are too stupid to be able to function in a real Communism.|`|6B3ojD2Laa	No it shouldn't.  Most of us don't care enough about the masses of people even in our own country.  We want benefits from the government but we don't want to have to pay for them. But so many people want benefits too that it could "sink the boat".  There has to be balance to have a civil country.  Communism isn't the answer. Neither was G.W.Bush, a right wing dictator type.  We Democrats don't want extremes; we want intelligence.|`|9XtUK8z6aa	Republicans do not believe this.

The sole purpose of the start of this country hundreds of years ago, as stated in the constitution, is the right for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That's what this country is built upon. Although many scholars have made theories that communism, if done justly, can be successful. However, it'd be extremely hard. A doctor and a janitor make the same income. Because of that, people would be discouraged to do their best and strive to become those things. It makes for a slower education in a country, therefore we would not have the power we have now. Many would probably say that China is doing well off, but in technicality, China does not follow real communism; more of more democratic way in a sense. People can make their own business and live their own lives. Just think about it, Cuba, a real communist country, has people doing anything to get to the US because of how communism runs their lives. So many things would change if this country became communist. |`|b34097e00cc43af49d3e428d9a0bbb58aa	Did you say Communism takes away rights.  Do you know what you have lost in the last eight years.  You might think about where all the jobs have gone.  Bush and his buddies attempted  to create a system whereby they could throw anybody they want in jail and keep them there for as long as they wanted without getting to see an attorney.  Even US citizens.     Used to be we had some freedom to go about our lives without being watched and listened to without our knowledge.  Things are changing toward something worse than a communist society.  Ever read George Orwell's 1984
AA11472314	Did you mean "tenet"?    The church donated exactly $2,078.97 in total expenditures.  People that go to that church donated around $20-25 million and a lot of hours. Had the church done any more that, then they would have been in violation of law.    To repeat: the church gave less than 0.01% of the funding. People of that faith gave about 60-70% of the funding.

Marriage hasn't been legal in California for nearly the entire time it's been a state.  A liberal mayor and a couple of judges tried to push their will on the people of California.  There are only about 7 million Mormons in the USA.  Only about 1% of California is LDS...hardly enough to swing the vote.

They told us the California state public school curriculum would be modified to teach sex education to kindergartners. Lies.    They told us churches would lose the right to free speech. Lies.

rJLeVoMKaa	Consider the source!      The national media does not bring up evidence against Obama because it supports him and his followers of his ideas.      There are people who are thinking- they are members of religious, the conservative, and sometimes both groups.  They express concerns all the time, but the question is does anyone listen?    I think we are in for a rude awakening in the upcoming months/years because I think GOD needs to get our attention.  This is not to say this is a bad thing, but our country needs to understand why he needs our attention.     I am concerned like you because I have problems of own, but I know that he is in charge.

3cxwalh0aa	McCain... lesser of the two evils - he's way more experienced and moderate than Obama. Obama's voting record is extremely liberal (when he actually DOES vote on something and doesn't just vote "present"), so he automatically alienates half this nation.     There's all these promises from Obama that only the "rich" will pay more, but they're inevitably going to find a way to offset their higher taxes. How? Business owners will cut corners with their employees and products. More than likely they'll put out lower quality products, and cut hours and downsize employees because they can no longer afford the current payroll.     I'm more conservative than liberal... I don't agree with wealth redistribution, a largely democratic concept. I believe strongly in states' rights, so if one state wants gay marriage and another state wants to ban abortion, fine. The less big government in our lives, the better.    Edit: I'm 24, lower middle-class, and I'd consider myself independent, but I do tend to lean Republican when it comes down to it.|`|Pe15GxjSaa	McCain. Obama doesn't understand how the tax system works or who pays for what. He wants to take more capital out of the hands of the people who use it to provide jobs, and products. He has the idea that the answer for everything is larger government. McCain knows that's not true.   McCain wants to see the government grow smaller and the private sector grow larger. He also wants the country energy independent. Obama has not wanted us to develop our own petroleum reserves by voting against domestic drilling. He also wants to increse the non-taxpaying sector of the population. That's called "buying votes".|`|MtAhztRUaa	if i could id vote obama|`|OUsdltgdaa	Mccain.

I am voting for John McCain, because i don't want bigger government, and I don't want to see wealth get redistributed. Why should something that someone worked so hard for, go to someone who hasn't worked a day in their lives, and lives of my hard earned money, along with Millions of dollars from other hard workers and achievers in this country? Why should I vote for a man who has been to all 57 states? I don't like the idea of socialism either. Bigger government gets countries no where. If it did, Russia would still be the USSR. Vote Smart, Vote to keep America America, Vote for McCain Palin.|`|gkvdnw8caa	McCain.  Not because I am incredibly impressed by him, but because I am frightened of what Obama will do as president.  He has shown during the campaign that we will no longer have free speech.  He is going to impose increased taxes on businesses which will eliminate jobs and hurt the poorest people in the nation most (businesses don't pay business taxes, consumers do when they purchase the products.  Business taxes are simply hidden taxes so that the public won't see how much money the government is taking from them.)  I would expect that in addition to the loss of free speech that we would also lose the right to bear arms and freedom of religion under an Obama presidency.  Unfortunately I don't think that there is any stopping it because too many idiots in this country are listening to Obamas lies.    I'm 26, conservative unaffiliated with a party, but vote republican because it's the best of the bad political parties we have to choose from, and I am in the lower-middle class range.|`|AA10828835	OBAMA!    he's a college grad....unlike mcbush.  he's an apt speaker....unlike mcbush.  he's inspirational.....unlike mcbush.  he does not have a terminal face cancer.....unlike mcbush.    i am 32, i am republican, a moderate, recent college grad, live in western Pennsylvania born n bred.|`|12c6cce6cfd314ae47979facba5d116aaa	55+ (but not much!)

McCain said that the fundamentals of the economy are strong, and he was absolutely right!  The fundamentals don't mean the current state of the economy, but the whole system (meaning capitalism)  Capitalism is strong when people don't abuse the system.  We are a capitalistic society and I believe it should stay that way.  Obama wants to stray away from capitalism and lean more towards socialism.  I don't agree with this, and that is why I am voting McCain.|`|15m9I4lHaa	I am voting for Obama.     I am 18.   Living with my parents, so I don't have a class.

gbJy9b1kaa	I'm voting for McCain this time around.    Mainly because of Obama's redistribution of wealth plan.  I don't agree with the philosophy of punishing people for being successful, and rewarding people for being poor.  It removes incentive for individuals to better themselves.    Also by raising taxes on small businesses he will force the owners to either downsize, increasing unemployment, or larger businesses will liquidate all of their employees and send their work overseas to avoid the tax hike.  Leads to even higher unemployment.    I don't support a social health care system as well.

This just makes sense for everyone. Whatever you are paying now (or your company is paying for you...with money that otherwise YOU'd recieve) would be cut in one third with a single payer health system. Better rates on medicines (bargaining power...working for the American people), no corporate hospital profits, no insurance company profits, no ultra-high paid CEO's all around...all of this would be gone, which reduces the cost of healthcare for everyone. I'm not saying to run it like a third-world dictator would.   our country deserve to have good educations and not have to worry about whether they can afford it or not.  -Intelligent foreign policy...no wars of attrition.  -Civil Rights.   -Slightly higher taxes, but you can see where your money is going...to benefit you and your family.  -Balanced budget. Liberals do not believe in borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia, neither of which are exactly friendly nations. The interest on our loans is currently at $385 BILLION PER YEAR!!!! That's over $1000 per year for every man, woman, and child in America...just to pay the interest!  -Freedom of and from religion. We believe that everyone's religious views are their own. Having one religion dictate what is ok for us to do, while ignoring the other religions is tyrrany, and is theocracy.   -War. Only when truly neccesary. Iraq wasn't. There was no "Clear and present danger". We did not need to commit genocide over there.

rJLeVoMKaa	I have to agree with the other people's opinion about Obama because I do not trust him.  He reminds of a modern day dictator who promises to make economic changes, promises a better day, and promises to bring hope in dire situations.      I am not saying that things are not tough,  Right now, I do not have medical insurance, and my family struggles with the loss of retirement income.  I know things are dire because I live in it everyday.  The one thing I do know is that GOD is powerful, and there is nothing that he can not help us handle.  He uses adversity in our lives to develop, but he is sympathetic.  He makes sense when nothing else does.    With that said, it is my prayer that people will not surrender their freedom for temporary difficulty.  I care about people's struggles, but the worse thing you can do is to surrender your freedom.  Our founding fathers sacrificed their lives and fortunes to allow future generations to have a better life.      The original question is when Obama wins the election and makes changes will it help America.  The answer is obviously no because he does not have America's best intention in mind, or if he does he is deliberately misguided by the politics of the liberal philosophy.  I hope the freedom of worship will continue.  I have many other concerns, but when I heard his April speech in Pennsylvania criticizing Bible believers and gun owners that was enough right there to tell me what type of person we could have as President.      I do not trust not because of his race, but I do not trust him because he lacks the leadership experience to lead, he does not support the tenants that make America strong, he does not believe in the American people, and worse is he does not have moral fiber to be president.  I am calling him out!    Some of you who may read this opinion will think I am weird or crazy for expressing my beliefs, but I readers to know that Obama is not right the person (period).    GOD (Jesus) cares about your heart, turn to him, and he will respond in love.

If Obama wins, the majority of the American People will have only themselves to blame.  We are going to be subservient to Europe and the Euro. We will prove once again that when people living in a democracy learn that they can vote themselves generous gifts at the expense of the public treasury the end of that government is close at hand. We are at that point and Obama will assure it.  
rJLeVoMKaa	Truth is a beautiful thing depending on the spirit of its deliverance.  I think Obama has a lot to hide because he is on shaky ground, and I believe he will eventually make that fatal flaw that leads to trouble in his Presidency.

Cons: The system can be inflexible.  Fair allocation of resources can mean that the  rich who would otherwise receive special treatment do not receive special treatment.  It can be difficult to start a new business, and it can be difficult to dismiss incompetent employees.  Taxes are high - in Sweden, the richest people pay 60% income tax.    Pros: No one dies for lack of simple medical treatment or lack of housing.  Minimum work conditions are guaranteed.  Education is made a central part of the state budget, not an ad-hoc affair like it is in the USA.  You cannot be fired without cause.    I should point out that just like anything else, socialism can be very nice or very nasty.  It depends on the implementation and the culture of the people who choose it.|`|Ebecdbt1aa	Socialism...

Give up your belief.  Accept the possibility that other ideas can teach us.  We don't have to embrace something just because we were taught from birth that this is the only way.|`|AA11223214	If Socialism is so good, why are those countries employing it FAR behind the USA in gross national product production? Why do so many people want to come HERE, versus going THERE? Because, despite the chaotic tendencies of the American system, it out-produces others because of it's populations huge devotion to bettering THEMSELVES first...and when they do, they benefit society as a WHOLE.      When you believe the government is better at chosing the direction than the sum of it's entire civilian parts, you have chosen a failed system. Chaos is required to produce superior results and innovation. Innovation almost NEVER comes out of government leadership. It's leadership by committee, and committee's rarely produce anything but fertilizer.     The few pro's are a general increase in low-level life quality, but at the expense of superior living conditions. Same with medical, you may spread out the health care, but it gets thin that way.      Suffering is unfortunately a very real life requirement...for every deer killed some coyote, mountain lion, or vulture gets to eat and live another day. While it may be sad, it's the way our system works, whether in lives or jobs - some get eaten, some live another day. You gotta fight to survive, the best do so, the rest , whether unsuited or just unlucky, don't. Sorry, that's how it works. Socialism tries to overcome this, but degrades those who can do so much better than the rest. Do want a bell-shaped curve from poverty to Oprah or Jay Leno, or do you want a flat-line with no one having anything to LOOK forward to? If your life will stay where it is regardless of effort, what's the point? THAT is what Socialism does by trying to make everyone "equal"..it takes away success from those better equipped to achieve it. Only the losers benefit. Not a good reason to go down that road in my opinion...    - The Gremlin Guy - |`|d9ed9dff945b7b709363c0879a2a656daa	The pro is that we don't have to work . Most Americans work most of their life so they can save and eventually quit their job but still provide things for themselves. Under socialism we won't need this and will be able to quit our jobs immediately so it all sounds good to me.

It is also true that fear works as a tactic. Ask your self how many voters are not voting for the candidate, but rather against the opposition. This is fear in action.

They say that economy is falling even when the stock market fell more under Bill Clinton.    Obama's and Hitler's similarities:    Delusions of omnipotence: Obama thinks he can fix everything. Also, he thinks he has unlimited power. It is documented that he tried to use police to stop people from publishing negative articles about him.     Megalomania: Obama created his own presidential seal and created a grandiose acceptance stage.     Messiahship: Thinks he is an anointed one who arrived at the perfect time to "fix" America. His followers think the same. They say he is the "right candidate at the right time" ( http://digg.com/2008_us_elections/Obama_... )    Hypersensitivity: He phoned and screamed at a reporter who printed a slightly negative article about him. Also, he tried to use police to stop reporters from printing articles about him. ( http://digg.com/politics/Barack_Obama_Sc...  http://governor.mo.gov/cgi-bin/coranto/v...  "Enlisting Missouri law enforcement to intimidate people and kill free debate is reminiscent of the Sedition Acts - not a free society " )    Delusions of persecution: Obama thinks he is being attacked because of his race or his former religion.    Panic attacks: Obama says "uh uh uh uh", which is common among people who take anti-anxiety medication.    Irrational jealousy: Because Obama was so jealous that Palin has stolen his thunder, Obama sent over 25 lawyers to Alaska to try to find garbage on her. The lawyers found nothing so Obama tried to attack her over non-issues.

Stupidity, fanaticism, arrogance and projection of their intolerance on other voters, expecting them to respond like they do. In addition they have been using fear since the days of Joe McCarthy.

The BBC Reports: "Officials from Kenya's opposition party were behind attacks on members of the president's ethnic group and are planning more, Human Rights watch says..."    http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/720665...    10) Obama helped Odinga with the skills of " community organizer". Obama knew all the time and gave all the support to Odinga in the killing of the Kenyans CHRISTIANS.    PROOF:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh10-w351...  ( MUST WATCH)  45 seconds ago   Source(s):  His complete name is Fidel Castro Odinga. He is the eldest son of Kenyan Prime Minister Raila Odinga and a first cousin to Barack Hussein Obama. The late Obama Sr. was the prime minister's maternal uncle. Although Obama Sr. was educated at Harvard and Odinga in East Germany, uncle and nephew were friends and political allies.    Today it is Barack Obama and Raila Odinga who have formed a transcontinental political alliance. In fact, Senator Obama, in an unprecedented breech of protocal, went to Kenya in 2006 to campaign on his cousin's behalf in that country's presidential election.    Raila lost the election when a secret pact was revealed with Kenya's Muslim Brotherhood to institute sharia law in all the country's courts in exchange for their support of his candidacy. This is all the more remarkable because it is Christianity (66%), not Islam (10%), which is the largest religion in Kenya, and English common law, not the Koran, which is the basis for its legal system. Or, perhaps, it is not so remarkable, after all, since both the Odingas and Obamas belong to the 10 percent.    Although not an observant Muslim, Odinga does represent Moammar Qaffafy's oil interests in southern Africa, which may better explain his willingness to tranform his non-Muslim country into a Muslim state as Idi Amin did in Uganda when he was the recipient of the colonel's largesse 30 years ago.     |`|2a9MLpZRaa	They cause me so much frustration and they don't pay me anything.

Why would they want to fix it now?|`|AA10447614	The problem with the electoral college is that in a close election it is entirely possible for the majority candidate by popular vote to lose (as happened in 2000). While it may not matter in this election - I honestly don't think it's going to be close enough - we should consider abolishing the electoral college because it's not necessary anymore.    The original reason for it was the fear that the electorate was not educated enough to make important decisions as to who should be president. In this day and age, I think there's no excuse for being uninformed - maybe we're OVERinformed (the Democrats made up an argument in 1996 called "Hyperdemocracy") but that alone doesn't justify the continued existence of the electoral college.    Democrats and Republicans alike will probably support the removal of the electoral college following this election.|`|oojO4WAraa	Nothing is going to change with the Electoral College in this election.  It would be good if it was changed to reflect the popular vote - in Kansas (where I live) the majority vote gets all the EC votes.  It would be better if the EC vote reflected the actual vote - like 60/40 or whatever.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No.  The popular vote concentrates power in the heavily populated areas and underrepresents everyone else.|`|0j9Ggisxaa	I wont.. It works.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	I have long advocated doing away with the Electoral College and this proceeds the 2000 election. However, you will not see a broad call for abolishment. The average person only has a passable knowledge of how the college works. Therefore it is difficult for them to properly understand a discussion regarding it's failings. This is not really an attempt to question the intelligence of anyone. It is simply a matter of understanding intent and purpose.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	No, the Electoral College is part of the Constitution and the last vestige of the idea that we are actually independent states with a weak Federal Government..
9BcQ5XMXaa	Good thinking. Main stream is main stream. There is no changing it. The only change possible would be for McCain to go in a different country where mainstream would be in his favor ... unfortunately for him, other countries are educated and civilized too ... so try harder John!!|`|ME6iuKvaaa	Try to separate the objective qualifications of the candidates in your mind from media treatment of the candidates and the issues.  For example, one "mainstream" anchorperson introduced a segment of the news the other night by describing Bill Ayers as a former Vietnam War protester.  Sheesh.|`|8c9d225dad2c0d82d38d3b55fce773e9aa	Why can't we see, or at the least hear the transcript of the tape that the L.A times is holding? Is that too much to ask for?  |`|Omb3mZaiaa	most of the republican base are a bunch of degenerates who are anti establishment. |`|gh7mVCCfaa	That is correct.  The GOP will spin this and file lawsuit after lawsuit and make a mockery of the US.|`|u23sBafTaa	 The mainstream media has been biased towards liberal views for years.  This election year it has been even worse, I saw a chart today that said 70% of news stories in main stream media on Palin have ben negative. It was also very high for McCain. The majority of stories on Obama have been positive.  They chose to over look a lot of things that they should report on to give a slanted view to suit their needs, that's why so many people are bashing FOX news they have been having both sides represented on their shows. I for one don't watch any news other than local unless it's on Fox|`|iVv6bFW2aa	I agree with you. Most of these Republicans are blind narccistic, paranoid , with a poor hold on reality.They need Fuhrers like Bush and McCain. Therefore, McCain can do no wrong, and everything that happened was the Democrats fault

Just wondering.    In answer to your question, the answer is no! Why? How would we know if you're a legal U.S. citizen? How would we know that you don't have a felony conviction? So, no there should never be "automatic" voter registration!    |`|iVv6bFW2aa	No because it's their standard rap or smear. They would still try to challenge and harass voters especially at the polls, and at registration, as they have always done.They are also helped by Republican County Clerks or Secretaries of State..The harassment occurs mostly in minority and what the consider Democratic areas. We would need strong laws to prohibit their antics, and even that might not help a whole lot.|`|qibtUmiLaa	We would probably feel better if the libs would stop signing up dead people to vote.  The dems must be really afraid of losing if they have to cheat in order to win.  |`|6AgnCKCPaa	No, that would just make it easiesfor unethical groups like ACORN to cheat the system..|`|ovSkTNCoaa	Voter fraud should be a concern to Democrats as well as Republicans. The right to vote is nearly sacred in the United States, and elections should be free from any kind of tainting. You have to admit, with the fraudulent voter registrations and the large amount of early/absentee voting, the possibility of fraud is immense, and in a close election, as this is turning out to be, it could be won by fraud.  Why is it wrong to validate the person's eligibility to vote when precincts open absentee ballots? It is the ONLY time that eligibility can be checked. After the ballot is removed from the envelope, precincts loose the ability to track it.|`|cylb8em1aa	Only if they can pass a test.  Simple questions like:  Who is the Vice President,  name three proposed policies that your candidate stands for, who is your candidate's running mate.      If they can't answer, they don't qualify to vote.  End of report!    See how easy it was to disqualify over half of the liberals?|`|715f1626818f5d62fcf3ef5c3b86c820aa	funny,democrats have the history of voter fraud,and do everything they can to encourage it. why not let those that want to vote register and stop having non governmental groups doing it.it is easy you want to vote take the time to go to government office and do so.
Z6lhZiXsaa	Yes and we'd be better off!|`|dFAcGubraa	You betcha|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	Oh sure, he could. But would he? That's the question.

Not sure about politics.|`|jU9qQwT8aa	Sure, as long as we have ESPN and TV Land! Oh, and Hooters.|`|SQM4X4idaa	no!!    Because without either of those there will be CHAOS.      We play politics at home at work at anywhere else.  When we want something we know how to get about, even our own kids will play us like suckers too when they want something...how about asking one parent and if they say no they'll ask the other parent? If that's not politics I don't know how you would call that.     Religion is all about the spiritual life and I need that for my peace of mind and knowing that life is everlasting...|`|rseXEb4Zaa	Yes we could if we acted like cavemen.    WAIT!!! there was a sort of politics though for cavemen. It was probably which one had the biggest club and which one could hit the hardest.      P.S.

That's because religion has caused great divisions between people, wars and violence.Examples are Al Queda, The Crusades, the Inquisition,  as well as Sarah Palin's Fundamentalism, which leads to much intolerance and discrimination Politics on the other hand are necessary for survival because people need to know how to govern, and defend themselves from injustice, exploitation and war.|`|wOXK6YIGaa	Yes|`|4vA3i6hOaa	A few could, humanity itself couldn't. 
AF0crtCRaa	It is amazing people still feel this way, this is not the 40's or the 60's.  He has the right to free speech, so I will not take from that.  To answer your question, his question was definitely more offensive.  Your answer was just real, and your true feelings.  People like that individual are not even worth the stress, any man/women who hides behind hoods are cowards.  There is a reason why hate groups fell out of popularity years ago, but if they want to start the hate again, then we are ready, and they are out numbered.  This not back in the day, they do not scare anyone, and its a shame that people still feel this way.  I say F them.  You are obviously the bigger more intelligent person and I support you.  Remember, this man beliefs are not a portrait of a true American or even human.  He is scum, and belongs locked up somewhere.  Thank you for sticking up for what you believe in.  The world is a better place with people like you and I.  One last thing, this election has exploited the true beliefs and fears of many whites across our nation.  There is no reason to fear, we should all support one another.  "United we Stand, Divided We Will Fall"|`|DgfEkFGLaa	I think that the question was deliberately wrote to provoke Obama supporters, goading someone to respond in anger, for the expressed purpose of reporting them. In other words, you fell into a trap which was set by that person. If a question seems out of line like that then just report it without an answer. Don't let them trap you. That guy is probably furious that McCain seems to be losing and he wants to "get even" with Obama supporters. |`|RkfIPD7Iaa	People often whine about the 'people monitoring this site'.  The truth is, that is you and I.  Nobody comes along and reads the thousands of daily posts.  If a valid report is made, the question or answer gets deleted, simple as that.  UNTIL that report is made, the questions or answer stands.    So to answer your question, yes, your answer was almost as offensive as the question appears to have been.  The proper action on cases like this is to report the question, but you took the time to post a foul mouthed answer.  It was properly deleted.      I didn't see the question and can only go by what you've told us, but you would have removed it from view much more quickly by just reporting.  I know, it's not as much fun or as satisfying as posting your answer (I've done it too), but it's more effective.    |`|AA11995584	Appealing an answer goes to a cyber trash can. Do not waste your time, you will not get a reply,  nor will anything change.    |`|peJO1pgBaa	It may appear that the people monitoring this site as well as many posters posses only double digit IQ's. While it's clear of many of the posters such as the one you refer to, one would at least expect a minimum of competence from the employees at Yahoo! charged with running this site. I suspect while those people may at least have an intelligence comparable to a simian, I think they're just lazy.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	THe question you describe should probably be reported.  As far a offensive avatars go.  The Community standards are clear they do not belong, but nothing is done about them.  There is aguy on here who's avatar name is Mud Killer.  Based on his posts he clearly is one of the lynching mentality, yet his avatar remains.  There are a few others that will set up under an extremely offensive avatar and avatar name, then a few hours later after a bunch of flame questions, they change it for a while then a few days later change it back!!!    |`|3tNTOtc4aa	Paloma, I gave up appealing because I don't even think they read them. I've come to the conclusion that it's a waste of time and energy appealing a violation.   There was nothing wrong with your answer. You were perfectly entitled to your right to reply especially against an obscene question like that.    Don't let it get you down. We should all be very happy today!|`|zaMTz8z5aa	This story really scares me. I think that a lot of people are a lot more racist that I wanted to believe. I have even had kids at school making terrible jokes about touching black people and black people being criminals and rapists. I didn't think anyone thought like that any more but they do. It is like some old movie or South Africa under apartheid or something.  I hope Obama wins and then they will have to learn that white people aren't better than black people..that people are just people and some are good and some bad and color is not what makes that so.
HmNqCDsQaa	No, and he won't ever admit that it's his huge ego, either.|`|EzZgHpbDaa	Well he won't say it, but it's Bush that is responsible.

A3UftwH9aa	They whole-heartedly believe that there is some implied "right" to not be offended or for their wild assertions and paranoid delusions to be shielded from criticism.  If, Ford forbid, anyone dare challenge their belief systems, they will cry "discrimination" or "infringement" on their First Amendment privileges.  (Never mind that the First Amendment bars the GOVERNMENT from infringing on civil liberties and does not apply to private citizens on their own private property, such as an internet message board.)|`|DgfEkFGLaa	Isn't racism a fear based attitude?

Cowards!|`|QW3tkVt7aa	I've never made a racial comment about Obama.      However, I've never accepted emails from Yahoo Answers even prior to election season.  The reason for that is I really don't feel the need to read through emails from random people I don't know in which they do nothing better attempt to explain why their opinion is better than mine.    I have noticed, however,  Obama supporters bring up his race much more frequently than non-Obama supporters.  As a non-Obama supporter, I can say his race was never an issue for me.  I have severe issues with his views, but I really couldn't care less about his race.    |`|620bf4782ed6f9bc16a1201fc594986daa	They only want to give their input without having someone tell them off and make them look like idiots.|`|7ccfbfe1eb6af3c419ca6ab3840adadfaa	Wow... look at the hatred.

Of the only 6 people whose sentences he actually shortened, most had served the bulk of their time already, only Scooter Libby got an appreciable reduction in prison time (but still paid the full fine assessed to him), and they all still maintain their conviction on their record.

lutsZa81aa	During the Last Depression Wall Street Corporations and the Newport elite were taxed to build , TVA, Hoover Dam, Golden Gate Bridge,Electric Distribution hubs to supply entire midwest and Appalachia, Mount Rushmore, George Washington Bridge,Roosevelt Bridge, Interstate Highways,irrigation projects for agriculture,etc...  This effort employed millions of disenfranchised Americans and was called "Socialist" by it's opponents.  What was deemed "bad" for the rich back then actually improved our country from a depression to an industrial nation organized enough to generate a victory in WW2.  When we work together for our country and all benefit, it should be called "Patriotism", not "socialism" because it temporarily effects the wallets of the rich.    It is time for the ultra rich to pay more, if this means putting millions of unemployed Americans to work building Alternative energy porojects again, so be it. I am pleased with the accomplishments this nation made the last time we went "Socialism"  It is estimated that the Hoover Dam will be operable in 10K years if maintained. The faces on Mt. Rushmore are estimated to last 60+K YEARS!  I ask you, were they worth building, or were they socialism because the rich had to pay more back then to build them?|`|MEReSvZeaa	Wrong on both counts.

DdnWtGdMaa	I think you have legitimate reasons to want his parental rights terminated. In the state of NC where I live, once husband and wife are not living under the same roof you are considered seperated. I would contact the court or an attorney, if your husband has not seen the child nor paid child support he may not fight his rights being terminated. I think your doing the right thing, give your child a chance to have a better life, it takes more than just a man to be a real father, and he doesn't sound like a real man. Good luck to you both, you and your child.|`|AA10118655	As others have said, a lawyer is your best bet for getting this done. Based on what you said, I would think you stand a good chance of getting full custody and no visitation right for him, or at least limited, supervised visitation rights. But, don't let him get out of paying child support. Support and visitation are two separate issues, and one does not imply the other. |`|ZF8NWsg5aa	You need to spaek with your attorney and if you don't have one than get on.  My cousins sons dad did the same thing and he has visitation with him.  I guess every county is different and every situation is different.  You can't have his rights terminated a judge decides that, I would call the family court in your area and see what they say about it.  If it is documented that he has abused his other child than it is public record and the court should be able to get those papers and that should be all that the court needs to see|`|AA11388665	I think so.

Get this done now.|`|RWNllcLjaa	First off, talk to a lawyer.  Now, that said, what you are trying to do takes a court order.  It would be easier to get visitation suspended.  Understand that if you terminate his parental rights you cant get child support (I understand that you may think its worth it, but Im just saying).    Ultimately you need to start filing divorce/child custody paperwork and move forward.|`|AA11640261	If this doesn't give you the right I don't know what will.  Call a lawyer ASAP.

See an attorney that does family law and get the ball rolling while he is still in jail.|`|AA10356921	Given the information that you provided, I think that it's a very good possibility that a judge would terminate his rights. When you file for divorce, just explain it to your attorney, and have him or her file the paperwork along with the divorce, so that it doesn't incur more filing and court fees. Divorces actually go smoother when one party is in prison because the court papers are served on them without any trouble, they really don't have access to an attorney, and they really have no choice in the matter and therefore, you avoid a very nasty and bitter divorce. That may sound like a bad representation, but it happens. If the man is what you say he is, then I don't think you'll have a problem.|`|6bjpU5rtaa	Please talk to a divorce lawyer for advice.

Look into yourself and what you will see are manifestations of your our acts or omissions. Kings we have created and through our own lack of intervention allowed to rule. A dozen men standing together are stronger than a thousand divided. It is your choice, create your own destiny or it will be determined for you.    Our Kings have cast their lot motivated by their own aspirations to attain power and yielding to the powerful conspiracies of corrupt political parties which manipulate and divide us. They are no longer men but political tools of corporations and the chosen. We have taken the bait and surrendered our own common interests to self serving political elites wielding a system that guarantees its own perpetuation.    If you believe it matters which king you cast your lot upon to satisfy your thirst for freedom and gift to the republic the strength which already lies within it but stolen by our own submission you are a fool.

When McCain stopped being mavericky, Sarah went "rogue".
t3QAaSN9aa	The major reason was that he ran as a Republican.  The horrible condition of the economy has turned the country against Republicans and their failed policies.    McCain also didn't help himself by pulling the cheap political stunt of choosing Palin as his running mate. That choice turned out to be a disaster because he didn't sufficiently check into her background and abilities.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	The Economy - when the economy suffers, Republicans lose elections.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I think he paniced and because of that he ran a negative campaign which did not help him at all.|`|um87XJvmaa	Picking Palin.  She became an instant celebrity, the very thing that he had been pounding Obama with.  He was pushed into the background and then he became too negative.   He was looking old and beat at the end.  |`|u23sBafTaa	 I think he didn't have the best people working on his campaign that he could have. They didn't have enough people on the ground in local offices , he made a choice to except public funding as did Obama, the Obama backed out.  Obama bought the election.  Which is why the public funding was created to begin with so we didn't millions or trillions of dollars in Obama's case going to campaigns, yes he won ,but look at the cost? At a time when so many people are losing jobs, worried about paying heat and utility bills, and mortgage payments, frankly the excess is a slap in the face to all Americans.    I would have much more respect for Obama had he used the public funding he agreed to. The Democrats all keep crying about we need to help the poor how do they justify their candidate spending such a huge amount that could have done so much in other places.    Had McCain used the same type of funding he would have done much better.  however I respect him more for limiting it.|`|AA11765933	the man for some insane reason threw the election he could have chosen a much better running mate and you get a more thuro interview at a fast food place than for the second most powerful position in the country  Then there was the time he offered Cindy Mccain for the Buffalo Chip Contest That was certain to offend voters  Losing all 3 debates was a sure way to not win the Presidency.

But, I have some hunches of what might have happened.    Throughout the primary season, the "far right" voiced steady unease with McCain as a candidate.  More vocal voices, Limbaugh and Hannity, rejected a McCain candidacy from the beginning, and told their viewers/listeners as much.    Trouble was, Thompson ran out of gas, and, Romney was of the wrong religion.  I'm convinced, had Romney not been a Mormon, he would have received the nomination.    This background drowned out the better McCain, who felt he needed to "invigorate" the base, because, essentially, he was under attack by his "Republican base".    So, he got the nomination, mostly by default, then, McCain clearly shifted to the right on policy matters...immigration, torture, most notably.    His rhetoric, mostly way overblown by media, was Limbaugh like as reported.  But really, it was Palin that played this card much more than McCain.    Part 2 is the banking collapse.  McCain simply was not the person that could communicate all the gains Republican policy has done for America the last 30 years, as, I suspect, he really does lack a lot of understanding of such matters.  Not to say Obama had any original rhetoric here, because, he didn't.  Obama ran as an economic populist.    The Iraq war became a issue low in consideration, becasue of the surges success, and, a worsening economic state played to the opposition.      Could McCain have won?    You bet.    He was ahead or tied in the polls until the banking system went into a tailspin.    Would he have won without this happening?    Maybe, maybe not, no one knows.    In campaign at the national level 101 textbook, you win in the middle, not on either extreme, so, it is possible had McCain kept to a more centrist and coherent theme, he could have won, but, he needed a different set of gifts to do so, in, my opinion.    I regret not seeing a McCain presidency.  As the great NYT's columnist David Brooks stated, McCain has always had great instincts on policy matters.  Chistled, true, and gritty.|`|f30193c2e64bfb6773ec2b22c8676713aa	Palin and no message, just fear and insults.  |`|g3670NYBaa	Old and crazy|`|tY3bXlGyaa	Ignorant Americans|`|LHiiMDrNaa	The ruling-elite (Illuminati) decided that Bush and the Republicans were much too tarnished to continue on with their preferred agenda so they opted for the "B" team, the Democrats, to prevail in this election.

I'm sure they vetted her background and stuff...they probably knew about troopergate and the knocked-up daughter, but what could he possibly know about her politics?  She was completely unknown in national politics, had no voting record to examine, and didn't know anybody in Washington.    So let's say we buy that he chose her because he wanted a " folksy maverick hockey-mom outsider."  Don't you think he owed it to America to at least talk to the woman for a few hours before choosing her?  I lost a lot of respect for McCain the day he chose Palin.|`|320b2762f5cd39e51c805fc8b1bb91bbaa	YES.... HE DID WHEN HE CHOSE SARAH PALIN TO RUN WITH HIM.. HE KNEW NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD VOTE FOR THEM TWO TO RUN ANYTHING....

He knew America would not be stupid enough to vote for a ticket with her on it, so yes, he put the country first by providing a losing ticket, thereby allowing Senator (president elect) Obama to win, which IS putting the country first|`|AA10023996	Just can't get over her can you .

She is great, I can hardly wait for her to president in 2012.  Go Sarah.|`|f85d2eaa714e32eb552b6bf5728f5fe3aa	Well, the other part of this question should be: Did Sarah Palin put counrty first when accepting the position from McCain? If she truly cared about the country first, she would have made it clear that she is totally unprepared to be President.. that she lacked the knowledge to lead the country. They both came very close to setting this country up for a catastrophic failure.

This is a case of history repeating.|`|61229a5edd65b7a3460d98d36aeb272aaa	I don't know anything about blaming Obamy but the Democrats with their sense of redistribution of wealth through agencies like ACORN putting pressure on lending institutions to give mortgages to people who couldn't afford them and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac managed primarily by Democrats. True the Republicans in the White house did not provide the over site that might have prevented or lessen the impact of the financial collapse but the Congress has been led by the Democrat majority the last two years who gave the reports that everything was just fine and dandy.|`|V55kYQ17aa	Because the ill-educated Republicans blame everything that goes wrong in this world on the Democrats.

Coming to the realization you won't have President Bush to kick any more after January?  Since there was no criminal activity, no he shouldn't.

You can show respect to the incoming President-elect, but not the current officeholder?  Your obvious lack of respect is nauseating.|`|c9EOBuGHaa	And what basis is there for criminal prosecution?  There has to be an actual provable crime.  And property can not be seized without due process of the law; that is in the Constitution.  You might have a better idea of the legal system if you did not spend all those years believing that nut job Ralph Nader.|`|NS0LjZ68aa	Obama is president elect.  You're just another Bush basher!  You're  concerned about President Bush?   It's just the Libertarian party's propaganda.     I'd be more concerned about the Ethics Violations that might keep Obama from taking that Oath of Office in January.  It is believed that Tony Rezko purchased Obama's house and it wasn't disclosed in Obama's tax returns, as well as other charges.  (I believe that Ted Stevens, Alaska, just went through something similar.).  Then there is a worry about his connection to ACORN that may be found because of the confiscation of computers in Nevada, and the charges of rackaterring and conspiracy to commit fraud in Indiana.  It will be interesting to see what they find on those computers.  Then add the investigation of foreign funds/contributions currently in progress.     Sounds like lots to defend for a presidential elect ...never has been done before in history!     I don't know of any other president elect who had so many lawsuits thrown against them PRIOR to taking office.  This is scrutiny that should have been performed prior to now.      Do watch for the full page ad this week in USA today demanding that he show the American public that he is eligible under the constitution to become president.  That darn birth certificate and more lawsuits on that to answer.      Another question why would a candidate for President of the United States, a man who wants to take over the role of Commander-in-Chief in the war on terror, be using Joe Sandler, a lawyer who represents  CAIR?   They are a group that has terrorist connections.  Why would Obama choose Sandler to represent him in a law suit?   Of all the ethical lawyers, why this guy?  He hasn't learned that associations mean anything?      Sandler is a legal Hit Man for the Council of American-Islamic Relations in other words CAIR.  They are an organization with terrorist ties, and are un-indicted co-conspirators in the Holyland Foundation Hamas Funding trial.  Sandler's job in representing CAIR was to "stifle people from telling the truth about Islam."    I wonder if Sandler was another guy in the neighborhood and Obama didn't know his connections to CAIR?      It looks like you should be checking what Obama is facing...there are 3 more months before he is sworn in.  Perhaps now the blinded media will be doing some investigative reporting.   They'll be worried how the public is going access their lack of disclosure on information that should have been public before people went to vote.      What a great guy you've hired!  Impressive character and ethics.  I find it a travesty.  Watch for the public outcry, I sure will be.

How about more like the millions.    As a small business owner I just laid off 5 of my employees, all Obama supporters. I am one of over 260,000 small business owners who have pledged to lay off at least 5 of his flock. The number keeps growing! Just 4 days ago it was just over 100,000.    For those who have been watching my posts, I laid off the single mom of 1 who could not afford the health insurance I offer at $40.00 per week but felt she could afford to finance a boob job! I do not feel sorry for her child as her parents have him most of the time anyway.    I am sure John McCain would say he does not blame us. HE understands that WE employ 75% of all small business employees, unlike Obama who simply wants ME to work for HIS agenda. Not this business owner! I have worked my a$$ off over the last 9 years building this business from the ground up, not to hand over my "riches" to someone who does not deserve it, but to care for my family and myself when I retire one day. I see the worst of the worst in my line of business. I own a restaurant with 22 (down from 27) employees. Most of my employees are very hardworking and they actually appreciate the atmosphere I provide for them to work in. Then there are the people who do not want to work, come in late, call in sick, come to work high or hung over. THOSE are the people who aspire to do nothing better with their life and who appreciate nothing! Those are the people looking for handouts without having done anything to deserve them. Those are the people who place a higher value on drugs, alcohol, their cars, their clothing and their appearance, rather than living a responsible life by putting their priorities in order. ALL of them could easily afford that health insurance they so need instead of waiting for a government handout! After 9 years of financial and personal risk, tens of thousands of dollars spent building this business, working hours impossible for anyone to imagine, I will now close one day a week instead of working all 7 days. I am not about to handover my riches to the kind of people I mentioned above.

To let you know, it is the people who have money that help the economy...they have more expendable income to spend on high ticket items that put money out there.  You start taxing the s*** out of them, they won't have the expendable income to put out there, then what's going to happen?  When did it become bad for someone to work hard and earn their money?  My father in law literally started with nothing..now he's getting taxed more than you probably earn, and he's the bad guy for working hard?  But that's ok, Obama is going to make it so no one has to work and everyone get equal benefits no matter what they do.  It's makes morals like working hard go out the window...that's something great to teach the kids, isn't it?  Nothing in this life is free, get over it.

GWB has class and has experienced a transition.  He doesn't want the country to fail, thus he is doing everything he can do to ensure that it doesn't by handing off the presidency in the best way he can.      Ponny Proud -  What trashy sites you inhabit...and everyone knows already that they weren't found.  This is about the 4th time you've put out the same junk sites and information. Do show the ones where they found WMD were indeed sent to Syria.  Libertarians put up lots of evidence...I guess all of the reports, and conspiracy theories became truth according to your pronouncements.  I guess those reporters were in the secure presidential office briefings too.   I would like any of those reporters to show their security clearances.  I would assume they are the same people that said we bombed ourselves on 9-11.  And accordingly, it appears they are out for Colin Powell also.  Get a life.  Spend more time looking at Obama's background and the hype and lies.  Those are a tad more important right now.   As for George running to Paraquay....such nonsense!   Perhaps you are closet socialist radical feeling free to distribute your treasonist fallacies.

I am wondering why they believe they should have been able to continue their oppressive, divisive and  fraidy cat agendas forever and people wouldn't revolt against them? So, instead of grousing about the outcome of the election and crying in their collective beers, I think it would be more in order to re-evalutate their priorities.|`|PVeJcm6Taa	I think they're just still reeling from the loss.  I've tried to imagine myself in their shoes and I know it would take some time.  What I'm wishing people would stop doing is saying "he'll never be MY president" and other such comments, because if you live in the US he IS your president and we all want things to be better.  So take some time to lick your wounds in private, and hope for the best.  You've got to remember we had to do that for the last 8 years.  We know of your pain.|`|3lur9XHOaa	Do you think Democrats can talk more about themselves and their plans?  Now that they are in complete control after 14 years, you would think they would have all sort of discussion about the future of this country......but no, they would rather bash Republicans still.    One might question if the Democrats have a plan at all and think that they got into power solely on negative campaigning.

Sorry, the division wound was too deep this time (or so it seems to me).|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	No, the Democratic party is as united as it's ever gonna get, Hillary and Obama included. In some of his last rallies Obama called Bill a great president, Hillary a great senator and said he was happy they are his friends. He fully recognized all the good the Clintons have done. That and all similar events before should be enough for any reasonable person to unite the party and it did. The few Hillary supporters who still voted McCain and more so those who reject Obama today because of the heated debate in the primary, if they even exist, are unreasonable and illogical folks who no politician should cater to. Hillary stood for women's rights, abortion rights, equality for gay people and healthcare for all. If those issues are important to you and you voted McCain/Palin, you don't have a clue, are caught up in identity politics, like Hillary without realizing what she stands for, or have your priorities seriously messed up. Either way, that minuscule part of former democrats, again if they even exist, are statistically neglectable and at the same time probably harder to convince than Rush Limbaugh Obama is good or not that bad. If Hillary and Bill can't do it Obama can't either considering they're supposedly such big Hillary fans and that's why they are throwing this tantrum in the first place. He shouldn't waste his valuable time trying    He might give her a position or not, unlikely I agree with what the other poster said about her work in the senate, , but if he did uniting the party shouldn't be the goal. The party is united.|`|jsBxtO3eaa	He should have offered her the Vice Presidency.  Anything less would be an insult in my opinion.  So, no.  I don't think he should.|`|AA11667429	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!|`|0gjIhhWDaa	She doesn't want a pity position.  She thinks she should be the President.

The last good one, JFK, got assassinated. GW Bush is probably the worst President ever. Both parties are responsible for increasing the size of the government and putting a burden on us taxpayers. Obama will be no better, though I hope he proves me wrong. We will have a nanny state and his economic views are not much different than McCain's are since they both supported and spoke highly of the Wall street bailout and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and AIG. The list goes on. Don't forget both voted in favor of the unconstitutional Patriot Act and the DHS and still support those things. The Iraq War..basically the same..don't forget Iran. Sure Obama will probably withdraw troops from Iraq only to send them to Iran. Neither one want to withdraw troops from our other bases in other countries, which is a burden on our economy. Most politicians are corporate whores, Obama and McCain included. I don't think any of the liberal neo-cons in the GOP will learn anything or care. But I do believe this is a chance for good people to get back into the GOP. Hopefully, voters will look at the voting records of these people before they vote and not vote out of party loyalty. I doubt this is true now because if it were, Obama would not have won either. A third party candidate would have. I am going to end there because now I am going into another topic.|`|C7LlxSmqaa	Hopefully one term.  There were a lot of lessons this election.|`|jUWwcknJaa	I know it was a bad move for Bush to have been convinced by Dem's. to not regulate the mortgage industry.  I hope they learn to not listen to Dem's again.      |`|idlv3TAdaa	American Democracy doesn't exist because of Republicans it exists in spite of Republicans. Most Republicans are racists hate/warmongers who will NEVER admit they were defeated by the constitution and the forefathers (they didn't want the constitution) but they insisted on continuing their make believe existence. Then the South LOST the civil war, but did they ever admit it...NO. NOW, the same like minded individuals still refuse to admit their defeat. They will NEVER learn their lesson. It will always be up to other people to put them in their place. I for one plan on keeping them in their place for the rest of my life. I refuse to ever let another George Bush happen to America.
RuUUPWYUaa	As much as the country would love to rid themselves of the Bush Family in the White House; rushing him out of the Presidency isn't fair to the Obama Transitional Team or his Presidency.

AA11297448	Trickle down. When all the companies and CEO's were making money hand over fist in the late 90's, (thanks to the tech bubble, not Clinton), everybody was the better for it. The economy was great as a whole.|`|AA12291184	trickle down.,    however it hasn't worked since reagan days.|`|hQWucH5uaa	Trickle Down.

It's just someone peeing on your leg.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Trickle down, known as supply-side economics, wrongfully encourages the creation of supply for demand that doesn't exist.    You don't have to be a nobel prize winning economist to know that this creates surplus and then inflation.    They think supply is what drives economic growth and that demand is just a result of it.  They didn't realize that with stagnate wages, rising cost of living, and taxes on the middle class to make up for the tax cuts on the wealthy, the spending power of the main engine of the American economy became diminished, and therefore demand is diminished.      There is a difference between people wanting some new product, and demanding it.  Demand means they can afford it.      Giving tax cuts to the middle class will increase its spending power, thereby increasing demand, and then the rich can use their enormous wealth to create supply for demand that exists.    Common sense.|`|BsyC4gevaa	Either way, it is going to trickle down and then spread throughout the citizenship from the Oval Office once it is established by government legislation and who gets what.      p.s. Once the minimum wage is increased and assigned, then there will be a systematic cap on what the earning capability may be since employers will have reduced incomes--thus reducing the competition on the job market, and hence lowering overall potential incomes.    The capitalist system is dependent upon competition; and has historically, caused potential pay rates to increase.|`|FcER4P6naa	Trickle-down is perfect only if the wealthy spend or invest on domestic goods to keep and create jobs here. It is bad if they save most of their money or buy/invest in nothing but foreign goods. Spread-the wealth just plain sucks for honest, hard-working people. Only the lazy bums benefit by getting something for nothing. |`|CG5NnL8Yaa	I don't care as long as it finally gets to me! lol|`|saOsd6ukaa	Since Trickle On has proven to be an utter disaster may be we should give some thing else a try.|`|PtHThRoNaa	Reagan's trickle down economics failed.  And spreading the wealth does not work the way you think it does.|`|RuPxMfmjaa	I would certainly be in favor of trust busting, more and obvious government regulation needed to prevent cartels of 'imbedded interests' from employing enormous frauds  and fewer predatory business practices that the Republicans have initiated among all of their other,numerous crimes.|`|4FyJM8hhaa	Any decent government spreads the wealth. It is NOT a bad thing. The current administration is crooked; they give handouts to their rich friends, and not to the public as a whole. That totally contradicts the beliefs of the Republican party, as they shouldn't be giving any handouts at all. The rednecks out there can whine about Obama's socialism, but they don't understand the practice is already in effect, just not to their benefit.    I can only conclude that the average Republican is just not bright.|`|OOeh2vEWaa	Spread the Wealth    History has shown that the trickle down theory does not work.  Republican President Hoover tried the trickle down theory (his words) to solve economic problems during the last few years of his only term, when the greatest economic depression this country has ever faced began.  It is often called the Republican Depression because it was their financial philosophy that led to the collapse of the economy.  Tax cuts for the rich did not work and things got worse.  (We are seeing the same problem repeat itself encouraged by the deregulation of the financial industry.) |`|3BvJQwfXaa	There arent any economists that believe spreading the wealth will work.  Trickle down is a dumb term.  How about:  Would business prefer having more money or paying more in taxes?  But you already know the answer.

Besides, the real issue is not the distribution taxes, but the amount.|`|c24282040d7da6cf349fea698367f227aa	Trickle down has never worked, might as well try something different.|`|aWchXBlJaa	I hate that term trickle down economics.

Trout has made a very good point about cities but let's simplify this theory a bit. In Borneo there is massive logging of hardwood which are wiping out large sections of forest where tribes have lived off the land for thousands of years. But, now they can't because not enough is left to sustain their living.    So now people from the forest have to work for the loggers to care for their families. The logging companies pay 50 cents a day. Once completely self sufficient they are now impoverished. This is how companies act when not restrained by regulation or gaining fair waged through a strong Union. These people I have mentioned will likely get neither. They will remain the pitifully impoverished.    We, as a country, could boycott their hardwoods until the people are treated as people should be treated but the US will continue to embargo Cuba out of spite rather than taking on the world's disenfranchised in a proper manner.|`|NsOuglZJaa	No, If you can't afford to buy land, you dont deserve it.|`|sZFLtCbdaa	Because you are in favor of Nadar I will assume that you know Nadar doesn't want that.

Yes of course. |`|81c47abde70b0190294d3ed11549d58eaa	In a much earlier time, everyone owning a piece of land would make sense. Land was the unit to have.  The unit of today is much more complex. A home, free health care, free public transportation, free public education, online access serving as a phone as well. When I say free, I mean supported by taxation.  All this things do not have to be provided by the government, they can be served by the private sector and properly regulated by the government, like Medicare. Some sectors can not be provided under a fee for service model, but under an employees model (like Charles Schwab) because of the inherent conflict of interest, (health care is the prime example).  It makes no sense to have billionaires and homeless people living in the same country.|`|gy3dR9ewaa	 Dennis W, Tinman 12 and others who believe that people who work hard should be able to own the land forget the fact that many born with a silver spoon in their mouth and sitting on inherent-ed lands. how do they deserve any land when they haven't done anything?! i can't believe that these people don't take such a reality into consideration. the good old boys came to ie; USA and killed native Americans and stole their lands. i guess they worked very hard murdering natives and take their lands. then they kept passing on their land to the next generations. no wonder the protestants are the richest population in USA and own most of the lands and other resources in USA. Catholics came later and when most lands were already stolen. it isn't like they didn't work hard after all many ie; Irish, Chinese, african-Americans worked pretty hard and actually built this nation and don't have much to show.when Europeans ie, Portuguese and Dutch people arrived in South Africa assumed no one lived there however there were people Khoi Khoi people lived there but they moved around with their herd. to Africans it was inconceivable to own land. this was true with many natives around the world white man worked very hard to intimidate, kill and steal the land wherever he went!  peace   land,water and other natural resources should not be owned by any individual. it is here for all of us equally.  peace|`|64SObnr5aa	In the USA you may have your name on the deed, but the government really owns the land.    They tax the land, if you do not pay the taxes the government takes it back, along with all the improvements.    In affect, you are renting the land with legal protection.    It used to be you owned a piece of America, now landowners don't    Peace  Jim    .
t3QAaSN9aa	I honestly thought that McCain had better judgment than that, although I wouldn't have voted for him anyway.  Picking Palin was a serious mistake on his part.

Fundamentalist moose hunter may have rallied the conservative base but she di the same with the other side. She's everything that people don't like about conservatives.

He was the son of the pacific fleet admiral, went to the naval academy, (his only college) He was a hot dog pilot, nick name John "wet start' McCain because he caused the accident on the USS forestall that kill 168 people, he was transfered immediately. He got shot down over Vietnam, spent 5 terrible years in the Hanoi hilton, and was tortured excessively because his father was the pacific fleet admiral. He returned to the states and has been a senator ever since. He does not relate to the working man, he voted against sending rescue troops for the remaining POW's. He is computer and economically illiterate. He is part of the non-working upper class.  He was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He is not a leader he is a follower and a yes man. He hasn't had an original thought since he was a pilot, and those thoughts were reckless. If he wins the election we will have somebodies puppet in the white house, my guess.

Obama had all kinds of obstacles ie; African-American, Muslim background, born and raised in foreign countries, affiliations with a radical church and many many other lies ie; socialist, terrorist and etc and he still managed to win! pretty much GOP had no chance and not much of incentive to win. now they can leave this mess to Democrats and then blame everything on Obama and Democrats. people will forget and after 4-8 years people will forget all the mess republicans created and come back again for a long time o come, unless something radical takes place meanwhile.  peace |`|0sMpo4dEaa	It sure was|`|PnlzE7oFaa	The negative media attention probably.  |`|fdUOke8Laa	a lot of ppl aren't voting mccain now but i think there's nothing wrong with Sarah! at least its not as stupid as Obama's pick for vp!

The better question to ask is why do people resent wealthy people so much?  I am not rich, but I do not resent people that are.

That middle class citizens call people who advocate this "communist" (when they probably could not define the word communist properly) is a testament to their ignorance and the effectiveness of the wealthy.     We have a new era of robber barons in this nation and a new Gilded Age.

Also, the wealthy seem to have a lot of tax breaks or exemptions to work with.    They will not suffer if Obama raises their taxes 3%.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	They'll also still be rich under Obama's tax plans and when the economic problems are addressed and the economy grows, they'll be even richer.|`|THRtsl83aa	Because they are intelligent, hard-working people who understand economics and are willing to put in the additional effort required to become rich.  Of course, if they were taxed the same amount as everyone else, they'd be doing even better, and would be able to expand their businesses even more.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Because tax shelters, and huge tax cuts and loopholes for reinvesting.  The rich does not think as currency as wealth. They know if they put it into the bank it will lose purchasing power, so they keep reinvesting it, to help it retain value, while exploiting tax shelters, loopholes, and credits so they pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes.    The tax rate Obama is proposing didn't crash the eocnomy prior to Bush's temporary cuts to buy elections, so they aren't going to after Obama is elected.

The first is that America still has the highest GDP in the world, and that economic productivity has not began declining just yet. Stocks and bonds are merely secondhand transactions from one shareholder to another, and don't influence the market as much as reflect its current trends. Another thing is that the South Asian countries have much lower GD Ps then we do, but hold key factors such as technology and lower populations. America has a 13-trillion-dollar GDP while Japan has a mere 300 billion. However, because Japan is such a smaller country than America. There is more wealth for less people, making the standard of living higher. To answer your U.S. crisis question, I would watch this really funny video.

At no time before the election did Obama ever say that he wouldn's be able to keep his promises during the next four years but they may have to wait for his 2nd term!|`|G7G9liR6aa	You mean his lies?|`|VlMIkxwwaa	A1: I do  A2: just like that|`|Oh24zxFoaa	No!|`|AA10975398	Yes We Can!!!|`|2b3ihDVuaa	Yes, he will keep most of them because the people will demand that congress passes most of his measures.|`|oYjJWoZxaa	You mean his message....  YES WE CAN!  That meant....  YES WE CAN TAKE YOUR MONEY!|`|dquWzswDaa	It is not a matter of will he keep them but a matter of will the sitting Senate, Governors, and overall American people Allow him to keep them...the president doesn't have all the power it needs to go through a lot of people.......BUT remember he didn't receive all his campaign money from big lenders he received smaller amounts from millions of Americans so he does not owe "favors" to lots of large donors.....like every president since forever.|`|6VbNJOtfaa	Yes, I sincerely believe that Obama will take the hard earned money of the wealthy and spread it around the ghetto.|`|5bgJwNZPaa	I think it will be difficult given how many are going to expect something, but it will just have to be wait & see, as I feel you have to give any new president the benefit of the doubt.|`|5e1d75ad129c54be4c49ba585bb75f80aa	No I don't , how is it possible or fair to take from one & give to another   how will people survive , the economy is bad enough already !|`|K3uVBPTaaa	He won get over it|`|64d77l4qaa	Well... he didn't really make any laid out promises. He just said he wanted to bring about change and hope, but he never really went into any of it. Of the few policies he actually explained, he didn't actually promise that he'd do them. There were a couple things he pledged to do, such as the public financing for campaign, but he's already gone back on that so... I don't think he'll keep promises any more than any other elected official.    Mostly he just made blanket statements that people translated in their minds as meaning he's going to do exactly what *they* think needs to be done. That's why everyone went wild in the crowds - they were all hearing exactly what they wanted to hear, even though Obama wasn't saying anything with any substance to it.     It's an evangelical way of speaking. Loose wording meant to inspire without clear definition. People will fill in those holes with their own hopes.|`|pfVVSIihaa	He promised that "the road ahead of us is long and the hill we have to climb is steep" He promised the work would be hard and we would all be asked to do our share.    He promised that he would spend our money wisely and for the good of the many. he promised that if we all worked together we could show the world that America was great again.    He promised it wouldn't work unless we all pulled together.    What is so fanciful about that? Unusual from a US politician, in that it seemed sincere and honest. But certainly not unachievable goals.    He promised to be honest with us. And yes. I believe he will be. |`|ltMCDs7Haa	Obama don't think obama can keep his promises  even dems know this  well the ones in government who actually did the duping  not you who have gotten duped|`|wz9szz3Gaa	Obama has not pursued true reform in any offices he has held. He has silently and at times vocally cooperated with Chicago's Democratic Machine to preserve one of the most overtly corrupt political systems in the nation. He maintains his silence now, even though he has the political capital to do something about the problem, because his political allies in Illinois are the problem. These are the allies who drafted and gave him popular, must pass bills to herd through the state legislature; the allies who openly take credit for making him senator; the allies who control Chicago's political money. In Washington, his commitment to reform has been no greater- not even this year, as he promises "change" and "hope" LOL! Obama plays hardball and knows when to look the other way. Barack Obama is an impressive man he would never be here if he weren't. But he is not the force for "Change" or "Unity" that many naive individuals beleive he is. He is simply another liberal democrat politician who will divide America along the same lines as it has been for decades. As a policy maker, Obama has very bad ideas that would hurt America- they are the same ideas that have been floating around Washington for years, though in some cases more extreme. The same ideas espoused by Hillary Clinton,Nancy Pelosi,Ted Kennedy,Barbara Boxer, or any of Obama's other liberal ideological soulmates on Capital Hill. We should be examing Obama's friendships with corrupt felon for seventeen years with Tony Resko whose livilhood depended on sapping the taxpayer for subsidies and corrupting public officials like Obama.We need to question his 20 years with Rev. Wright these people have made a dent in his thought process and we must watch very closely to Obama's actions and his associates. Those who voted for him be careful what you wish for!      |`|95562b01fb8ad623f733a42e57cc76bfaa	The media is already priming us for the let downs.

Wasn't he the first to "go negative" in his debates with Hillary?  Wasn't he the first to play the "race card" (and continues to do so)?  Wasn't he VOWING to be "change" and we find he was ON THE TAKE with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?  Wasn't he VOWING to be "change" and we find he was on the take from Lehman Brothers?    Change?   Honesty? .... if you believe these things about Obama, you CLEARLY have gone through the last 21 months with your eyes CLOSED.

FCY3lwnoaa	You do realize that Obama wants to send a surge to Afghanistan AND invade Pakistan, right???    Many people are voting for Obama because they believe he is anti-war. He is not.    Obama does want to get us out of Iraq, but he clearly stated in the second debate that he wants to send those troops into Afghanistan AND he wants to invade Pakistan!    Regarding Foreign relations, Obama is much too green.  He doesnt have the experience to even know what critical questions to ask before moving forward.  This was very clear in the debates when Obama openly stated he wants to invade Pakistan.  Which brings up another sore point with me.  MANY people are voting for Obama because they believe Obama is anti-war.  Obama is NOT anti-war -- he is simply against the Iraq war.  Obama has clearly stated (during the 2nd debate) that he will not bring out boys home.  He wants to end the war in Iraq, but send a surge into Afghanistan AND invade Pakistan!  That is not anti-war!    IMHO, McCain is vastly more anti-war than Obama.  He wants to end the war in Iraq when it makes sense to do so.  Which, as it turns out, will be very soon.|`|AA11193401	no not at all

FpMCFvV5aa	If his parents were both American citizens, then there would be no question.  However, the first problem is that B. Hussein Obama Senior was not a citizen.  The second problem is that according to the law at that time, Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, was 18 when Obama was born.  Therefore, she wouldn't have met the requirement of having lived 5 of the previous 10 years years after the age of 16 in the United States.    Therefore, the answer to your question is no, he would not have been a citizen by birth.    McCain's citizenship is derived from the fact that both parents were US citizens.  It has nothing to do with being born on US soil.|`|YYbVDcw8aa	To run for President of the USA you MUST be born in the USA that is a law.|`|HPFmwuN5aa	Here's a better question - do you "he was born in Kenya!"  idiots think you'll ever give it up?|`|7bff7ea47220c4a2c1ed459571223e4eaa	The last thing we need is to add anymore military bases anywhere!

Legal experts estimate 40% of SO lists are innocent of the charges, but our plea bargain system and the current witch hunt mentality (like yours) strips them of a fair trail.|`|mQQWtCwFaa	Each county has it's own law. Depending on the nature of his/her offence and the year of conviction there may be no restriction at all. Keep in mind that a Sex Offender and a Predator are completely different. A Predator is someone lurking in a school yard stocking their victim...a sex offender could be an 18 year old who had concentual sex with a 17 year old, someone who urinates in public, etc.     There are two people on this registry in my county. They are both convicted of statutory rape of minor age 12-15. When they were BOTH 15 they had concentual sex. The girl got pregnant. The mother of the girl filed charges on the boy b/c she wasn't legal age of concent. Then the mother of the boy did the same. They are now on this list for 20 years and when you pull them up online and see the conviction without knowing the full story it sends panic through you. So don't let these lists alarm you. By the lawmakers having these blanket laws on what makes a sex offender it hurts the public more than it protects it. I'm not against Megan's Law or Jessica's law etc. But these laws seriously need reformed.

For example, if the admissions committee permits 4 classical pianists, 3 African-Americans, 6 Nobel Prize winners, 3 former 3rd World Dictators, and 7 former Olympians - and broadly seeks such a mix so that it would achieve a "critical mass" of diverse and high achievers, such is permissible.|`|tUq6qU3Naa	Except for the few that HAVE taken advantage of their opportunities, It is demeaning to the black people.

They have been in America for longer than most Whites and they still cannot speak good English.  I understand that they were brought here against their will.  But you would think they would figure out that in a complex society like America's they would study and learn what they need to to get a job or career.  Or do they still have a 'slave' mentality of needing to be 'taken care of'.    Why is there never any mention of the 370,000 Whites that DIED to free them?  Not even a memorial service anywhere.

No matter how your right wing wierdos like to portray it, it is still needed in some aspects of society, and it does provide a positive benefit to the nation.    Yes, there is still racism which would restrict people in their ambitions and deny them their freedoms regardless of their skill and ability.  It's not true in as many places as it was before, but it does still happen.     As an example, Republicans are fond of saying that Obama was an Affirmative Action attendee of Harvard Law School.  And so what if he was?  He obviously had the skill for it, graduating at the top of his class.  You don't get to be president of the Harvard Law Review by being a slouch.  If Affirmative Action helped him get into Harvard, then I say it was a resounding success.
iVv6bFW2aa	I would estimate about 75%.The rest got tired of Bush and his politics and they are switching. I would say that the switchers are mostly liberal or Moderate Republicans. Two notable Republicans of many  who switched are Gen. Collin Powell ( Moderate and former Solicitor General under Bush, Charles Fried ( Conservative ). They were both particularly concerned about Sarah Palin, as  inexperienced, and a heartbeat away from the Presidency. As time goes on more are switching,  like rats leaving a sinking ship.|`|52UwQKmWaa	Bush voters still exist? Dang.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Tell's us that they managed to vote in Bush twice, so after a disasterous 8 years, why should we trust their judgment on McCain? They lost all credibility to me.|`|285466a34d0961c1ac54895e036af8c7aa	They know McCain is a Bush clone, but they are voting McCain because they won't vote for a black man, it's the truth no matter how much the fools deny it...|`|iwyk2T7Faa	There are many difference between Bush and McCain. Bush is a dictator, but McCain isn't. Bush started wars, but McCain can't. Bush has many oil companies, McCain hasn't.|`|O3Yx21WMaa	To many
B4KM95Wzaa	I suppose it is difficult for you libs to understand opposing viewpoints. I guess that's why you try to silence those you disagree with. |`|THRtsl83aa	I'm a Republican, and I don't have cable, so I don't listen to FOX news, and I don't listen to Rush because I have a JOB.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	Unfortunately, if they got their "news" from the likes of MSNBC or CNN or the NY Times - we would be convinced that General Patraeus was a liar and a trader, we had lost the war in Iraq and John McCain was having an affair with a lobbyist.   We would know nothing about Obama's true ties with the likes of Ayers or Wright or ACORN.|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	Maybe if they can think a little before they speak ...|`|4Aauh87yaa	You are sooo right! We obviously need the "Fairness Doctrine" right now! How dare anybody express a viewpoint other than the left-wing's.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	LOL  I don't think they all do...just the neocons, and I don't speak neocon!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Well maybe. However the moderate ones like Colin Powell and Charles Fried switched to Obama , among many others so there aren't too many Republicans left. Of the rest who remain, some have no brains so they absorb the lies of Fox News, others read or subscribe to other reactionary media, and the few left who have some brains may come to their own conclusions without being brainwashed by the media. Maybe the latter I could understand a little bit.|`|5hxWSezPaa	I am a Republican and always have been one.  I am not a Fox News regular.  I get my news from both conservative and liberal sources.  I decide what to believe.  That is being a Republican.|`|2a9MLpZRaa	Well I couldn't be sure where they get their news from Fox or elsewhere, but then, I'm not the expert of Republicans you are.|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Are you kidding? All of the major networks totally are biased towards Obama. They totally cost Hillary of having a chance. Fox is fair and balanced! Why can't libs handle the facts? Did you see Biden get all mad when a reporter dared to suggest Obama is a socialist? |`|O3Yx21WMaa	I think I could understand Republicans if they would either stop using fear or get over there fears - Fear Obama is going to take there guns - fear Obama is going to tax them and give there money to bums - fear the commies are coming - fear the shy is falling in, fear fear & more fear.
6L7HFDSQaa	Only two responses so far should give you an answer. Sorry it wasn't the answer you were seeking.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes, these are just reactionaries , making crazy irrelevant accusations so it's good for Democrats to be rid of them, that's if they ever were Democrats. They could have been infiltrators too. Republicans in some states were encouraging people to enroll as Democrats in order to vote for Obama,with the assumption that he would be the weaker candidates. However  things didn't turn out that way.The video was great.PS the McCain supporters are probably happy, because they are stupid. These people as well as the Palin supporters are an embarrassment to McCain because of their fanaticism.
AA12074365	He will do what aristocrats have been doing for as long as recorded history,  HE will seek to weaken the voice of the people and protect the upper 1 percent he cares about., HE will manipulate the Media they OWN to get his supporters with a IQ low enough but high enough not to be aware there IDIOTS to hate some voiceless enemy and use war to control the masses.   THe poorest in the world when faced with hopeless poverty created will rise up and be crushed by the war machine payed for by the middle class and the poor.     THis has always been the plan. THE PROBLEM is that with nuclear weapons it cant work anymore.    John Mcain thinks WE are peasents and would like nothing more then to have what we had before Democracy.     |`|8qkJIun5aa	i hope so....lol|`|bHAJS1N0aa	Of course he will...he is a hater who sees us all as ants on an ant hill & he feels powerful when he can kick us down..People call him a hero when I can remember what he did to the POWs you can see the hearing of video at Vietnam Veterans Against John McCain but look around if you go to one place & they don't have the videos...he is on video admitting he crashed his won plane & injured himself them told the enemies are secrets so he could live in luxury...He made sure these people didn't come back...how anyone can't see this man for what he is, is unbeleivable to me...he is should be in prison for life...he names the list of places he wants the military to go to next...they want to make us all broke so we will beg to go into the miliary so they can make money on construction contracts.|`|4nD0NJReaa	Ouch, yes he would, although Obama may prolong the agony.|`|KL1FQhJ9aa	Dumb dumb dumb.  Pelosi, Obama and crowd have caused these issues by forcing financial institutions to loan money to people should have had it.  This is not Bush's fault.  If you really cared about the country, you would go get the facts and not be an ignorant voter.|`|E6DK6sSzaa	McCain has the same mentality as Bush and will continue the status quo.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	No That is the job of Pelosi and Murtha.....funny how you libs fail to notice that the economic fall did not start until the DEMS took control of Congress....|`|MEReSvZeaa	Iraq is thriving.    What exactly was destroyed besides a lot of terrorists?|`|5beb7432151cb15beb08a71c97dde6e2aa	actually, McCain has no intention of continuing the Bush legacy.  This is a lie made up by the Democrats to deceive voters.|`|ivsKcwwvaa	Obama, McCain, either one is qualified to do that. That's the best the Cons and Dems have to offer?    Take America back from the elitist, socialists destroying our country and constitution For REAL change    Baldwin/Castle 08 http://www.constitutionparty.com/|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes    This would be true and God help us if "that" woman get's her paws on the White House. |`|5m6tbimIaa	Barack Obama is the way the truth and our light out of this hot mess!!!|`|Wxqerexfaa	Yes mccain would be like bush pt 2|`|joh3VNcZaa	No, he'll leave that to Obama and the other Democrats in Congress.    A job that have plenty of experience at and desire for.|`|620L80L0aa	You know I don't think that humans have the capability of destroying the world, we might be able to kill ourselves off but after a while the world would be fine.    Just another example of human hubris.|`|RmkRifovaa	No, he'll drag it out for a while so that he can get re-elected in four years.  Then he'll slowly destroy it.  But it will be so slow that you won't even notice it.  It will be similar to the way they show nudity and sex scenes on network TV now.  Ten years ago, you'd never see the kind of stuff we're seeing now.  That's how the world will be destroyed - slow and painless.|`|bmwSoahKaa	We now have a another potentially democratic ally in the middle east.    You have a problem with that !    All hail Obama The One     Be afraid    1984
KKaggQr7aa	Yes your Nikah-nama from Bangladesh is acceptable. But u need to have it stamped from Foreign Ministry of Bangladesh, Embassy of Pakistan in Bangladesh & Embassy of India in Bangladesh to have it legalised for use in all three countries for authenticity purpose. It is also called "Legal Apostille". |`|QzIMP6Jdaa	As long as you comply with marriage laws of the country where you are getting married, the marriage certificate will be valid.    Make sure to find out if special registration provisions exist in Bangladesh for foreign nationals and register under those.     Nikahnama will be issued by religious authority. Check with Registrar of Marriages or an advocate first. The key is to comply with the local/state marriage laws and have valid marriage certificate.
DLsdhfuuaa	Two for sure, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn.  And there's a lot more radicals and terrorist supporters like Wright, Khalidi, Said, al-Mansour, etc.|`|5wdPKphVaa	Um, let's see...       Take your IQ and multiply it times itself...    Oh yeah...That's ZERO!|`|xM6Dlm3Saa	Obama and McCain are tied as far as terrorist friends are concerned...but McCain know a helluva lot more lobbyists, racist & bigots!|`|261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	We have the Palestinians, The Iranians, Hamas, .....

How many does he know personally, Enough so he could never get clearance to be on his own security team. |`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	no sane person on this planet would buy this story .|`|xz3NflVbaa	Just one. William Ayers is Obama's friend but obviously not a good friend or anything. Though I'm sure they bump into each other at times when Barack is back in Illionis since they're neighbors. |`|i9conSTBaa	who is Oboma?|`|sYSO9gKoaa	atleast 100|`|s6JEaiYkaa	None - who ever came up with this silly rumor is an uneducated moron  |`|HDCobrhAaa	Millions maybe billions you better join up or we'll GETCHA|`|z4vae3BHaa	I think you are a terrorist......which using your logic.....automatically makes you one.|`|YHbfiYVUaa	Well lets see...    United States House of Representatives: 435 terrorists    United States Senate: 100 terrorists    Lets keep in mind some of those 535 people are against promoting US doctrine through violence.  Also, Obama probably isn't friends with all of them...    So maybe about 200 terrorists would be a good conservative number.    So according to the definition of terrorism (from the U.S. Department of Defense), these 200 terrorists have used violence to accomplish political religious or ideological objectives.    While we're at it why don't we include all of the administration behind the figurehead Bush?    So yeah he's big with the terrorists.|`|JTu1cLkYaa	Zero. Another smear tactic by opponents to discredit him and cause fear to make people vote for them.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	The same as your IQ & spelling skills, zero.  Who is Oboma?|`|pElG2K61aa	None.|`|PtRmhxU9aa	Well, as Senator, he probably has met President Bush at least once or twice.|`|afkygHMgaa	LMAO. Again, his name is Obama.

9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	don't abstain from voting. vote for Obama, whose stand on health care policy, foreign policy, outsourcing  tax policy and several issues will bring immense pleasure to the poor, middle class people. all the right thinking people  and eminent economists ,have decided to vote for Obama.   IN THE AGE OF DEMOCRACY BALLOT IS MORE POWERFUL THAN BULLET.|`|eulMjLtPaa	You don't have to vote for president, but there are a lot of local issues on your ballot that need attention.  Please vote.  |`|MmbLWe3Qaa	Well, seeing as I'm 16, it really goes without saying. But even if I could legally, I'm not sure I would.      Hate to be crass, but might as well fart in the wind, you know?|`|L4eoLmvJaa	what tonalc2 said    the local elections actually have more of an effect on your life|`|S2FhDtfSaa	That's too bad. I served 2 tours in Vietnam during 1967-68 believing that I was doing something to protect your right to vote. Certainly you have the right not to vote, but that seems such a terrible waste that you won't even make an effort. Hopefully, more people of your generation will involve themselves in learning about the issues and the party platforms and make mature informed decisions. I realize that it is a lot to ask of an 18 year old today. We went to war at 18, but that was MY generation, certainly not yours.|`|ZlFZtTlmaa	I am an Australian and this time last year everyone over the age of 18 yrs had to vote but not me im not 18. (Kevin 07') haha. The soldiers in WW1 and 2 fought for your right to vote, that's why it's compulsary in Australia.  It should be compulsary for the U.S because their finacial crisis affects other countries. And if you don't vote there could be someone that you think is unworthy running your future.  Think about it. It's your kids + families future. VOTE!!!!!, Your an idiot if you don't.    Refusing to Vote is a lack of Respect|`|AuWHIJPKaa	You can refuse to vote, but look at third-party candidates first if you feel that the frontrunners aren't worth having. However, just a quick note to Viva La Vida l??  ?, have you ever read where it states specifically, "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the FREEDOM OF SPEECH, OR OF THE PRESS; OR OF THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE TO PEACEFULLY ASSEMBLE, AND TO PETITION THE GOVERNMENT FOR A REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES." Where does it mention a condition other than being peaceful. Show me.   |`|u8h3vlaOaa	Im voting for John McCain, im sorry you feel disenchanted.|`|om0zcFigaa	You've just turned 18, and you're not voting..C'mon! It's a black man and a white guy! It's the turn of the century!|`|2P18wyECaa	I honestly think its a matter of (without going TOO partisan)    Do you like the country the way it is..with MINOR changes?    or     Do you want to CHANGE this country so much that it turns into something completely different (what that will be I don't know)      I wish.....we had a more moderate Democrat this time around..because Obama states...VERY PLAINLY ....what we've been doing the last 50 years..this....democracy thing.....its not working....he thinks we are at a turning point where drastic measures need to be taken.    I personally don't think we are there yet.....I think we should reform what we have....    I really don't see the point in throwing the baby out with the bathwater.|`|AA10106538	I plan not to vote.  I do not want to feel responsible   for the mess that is upon us.  Either way we are all in big  trouble.|`|31cdde9814f215ac30f204bdcb9a0ef7aa	A hundred people huh? Sounds like your figures are off.    If you don't vote and something bad happens then you can't gripe about it.    I'm voting because it's the responsible thing to do.    |`|HReBWI6qaa	I already voted, but I can see why you wouldn't vote.  My decision was one of the hardest decisions that I've ever had to make, because to be honest, the candidates sucked (yes this does include the "great" Obama)...I have a similar opinion and I ended up going with the lesser of two evils.    There is nothing wrong with not voting.  Many people (including my own parents) deem it as a ridiculous choice but I think if you feel that you cannot make the decision or if you feel the election is too intense or that either way we are doomed, being neutral and skipping out is okay.  One of my best friends decided to do that and while I pestered her at first (during the summer) I have since accepted her decision (even though I think she's more Conservative than she thinks and I wish she would acknowledge that) and I am proud of her for making her own choice.|`|iP0TCgqXaa	I am a Democratic activist and have voted in every primary and election for the last twenty years.    And I am sitting this one out. I am boycotting the Democratic nominee, who does not deserve my support. Likewise, I'm punishing all the down-ticket candidates. I may leave the party as well.|`|Xr4CXAKiaa	Im not going to be 18 by the election whiuch sucks. But i would probably vote for Obama just to stay away from John McCain. If i wasn't voting for obama, i would probably pick the liberatarian party because i share some of their same views.|`|k496oVLFaa	I am voting, primarily for the other issues on the ballot. But while Im there I will be supporting who I believe in, Ron Paul. |`|ik1wMIYcaa	I am sixteen, can't vote|`|dgnjWRTvaa	Kris No matter how you feel you still have to vote. People have died so you can have that right.But let me ask Do you have a Boyfriend? Brother? Would you want to see them drafted in the millitary and sent to Iraq or Iran? McCain has already said if he got in and if needed he would start the draft again because the army is not big enough to do the job he wants to do. So that would mean boyfriend, brother, friend would be called to serve. I got drafted during Vietnam and did not have any say on where I could go. Dont let that happen to some one you love. GO VOTE please
AA11171465	Yes they can and I wish they would.    I think the state of Utah has a law  to what you are asking.  If I remember right you can't smoke in a car that has children in it.|`|pDU0F2QDaa	Congress could pass any bill that doesn't contradict the Bill of Rights or anything in the Constitution.    They would probably do it in the name of "health and safety," just as they passed the Patriot Act in the name of "security." |`|xfnnrrLkaa	they should do that for public places like isnt it illegal to smoke in public in Paris now ? and i think now it is illegal in australia to smoke in a car with a child in it|`|RkNCrQiHaa	They would probably do it in the name of health and safety.Just as they passed the patriot act in the name of security.
7VJWxbSWaa	That's what jealous people do. They are jealous of her intelligence, character, courage to stand for what she believes in.  She's articulate..uses proper English and speaks clearly, is physically fit, pretty, active, has a nice, large family, she has the ability to face family issues intelligently, she has a good husband, a successful business, was a successful Governor of the largest state in the USA, fought against corrupt politicians in her own party and state..and WON..    The people who criticize her are the ignorant who think just because they disagree with her political standings means they can bash everything about her. That is such a juvenile attitude to take. We are all adults..we should be able to agree to disagree...respectfully and politely. We all have our reasons for siding one way or the other and we have the right to do so. No one should be called filthy names, have their character muddied or their family brought into the discussion. Their family is not the issue.  I think the person who hung that manniquin in effigy from their house should be ashamed of themselves. That is a low, childish tactic and Sarah Palin deserves more respect than that...I dislike Obama..but I wouldn't disrespect him in such a vile manner. I guess it all boils down to what kind of parents you had growing up.  Some were taught how to respect others, some were taught how to hate.|`|92481f6ebfb9db90cc3432a3801df96daa	Any pig with lipstick can break a tie vote.  What if she becomes president?  If you and the millions of others who like her think she can be a capable president after watching her answer fairly easy questions posed to her by interviewers, then the electorate needs to be better educated.  Could most people have answered those questions intelligently?  Well, probably not.  Our VP's should answer them intelligently however.|`|bGgC1cSUaa	People hate what they fear.    Her views as a conservative woman stand in the face of everything they hate.    God (the ONE TRUE God)  Family (Man and WOMAN)  Babies (protect the babies FIRST , not use abortion as birth control)  Constitutional Rights (conservative values)    Those people all "like" those things also...but from jaded WRONG view points.  IE:   God (its ok to have ANY god)  Family (man and man is fine !)  Babies (love them but kill the ones we dont want or need)  Constitutional rights (Lets give more rights to one group than another, oh while we are at it lets just go ahead and change this constitution, its old and outdated)    THAT is the mentality of people that hate her (and of course some people are blind dumb sheep being led by the LYING Dem party)|`|8f0AJY8gaa	They are afraid of her.  Plain and simple.  |`|shtP63traa	The problem is that she comes across as a bit of a dullard.    Check YouTube for her interviews.  Sometimes she can't give a coherent answer at all.  Sometimes she's stumped by simple questions like naming even ONE newspaper she reads.    And then there's her gross misunderstanding of the VP's authority - she really seems to believe that she will have the authority to affect legislature in the Senate beyond just casting a tie breaking vote... despite the fact that the Constitution allows the VP no such privilege.|`|0cee90c25888a78a0b401efe2b753fd3aa	"I told Congress thanks, but no thanks"    because she started telling lies her first day on the national scene and hasn't stopped yet.|`|VYtW0uRiaa	Because they are so jealous of her.i like her and she tells it like it is.

She has lied repeatedly. she is a religious fanatic.  She has openly engaged in vicious racism and sears.    That's why decent Americans have no use for Palin.  Just for starters.|`|6El0zpBJaa	They fear her.    She cleaned up the corruption in her own state (even within her own party).    Washington doesn't want someone coming in and cleaning things up.    Looks like there's lots of kool-aid drinkers here who actually believe the far-left media.     I can see right through all of their propaganda.|`|9MjfQ1Ekaa	I love Sarah Palin...on Saturday Night Live!|`|c878ba3b6c9aa2d86aed0bde7375c751aa	Because she wants to take America back to the days when women died in alleyways and were forced to give birth to the children of their rapists.  Oh, and like I've said before, once someone uses the phrase "task from God" and "war in Iraq" in the same sentence, they lose ALL credibility with me.

Yesterday she made a comment on being in the home state of the World Series champions Philadelphia Phillies & she got booed, why because that was Pittsburgh Pirate country.  She might want to do some research before she speaks like mention the name of Khalidi having ties with Obama when her running mate, gave almost 1/2 millions dollars to the same guy.  Her approval rating has gone down, even in Alaska.

fhXTVn3Oaa	Obama and here is why...      I find Barack Obama to be an honest and thoughtful man, who cares greatly for his family and the people of the world. He's a breath of civilization after 8 years of a barbaric Bush regime. I also like Obama's energy policy (solar panels on our house generate enough electricity for my family's needs).Barack Obama has shown that he has an ability to inspire and unite each of us across all lines to work together as a United Country to change what needs to be changed. He is a man with a vision that reflects what the heart and soles of this great country represents..that anything is possible and that we can all work together and respect one another no matter what our beliefs or cultural values are.He stands for change-no more of 'the same old thing'people stepping into roles because they feel they have earned it or have the big political machine behind them. He will show the world that we are united and strong yet respect the right to each country to find its own unique vision, without us imposing our will on others.Yes we can be different but still get along in spite of the differnces. Obama is the face of the United States of America, he has pushed ahead in spite of the odds creating a sincere feeling of hope that we can all beleive in. Barack Obama represents the only hope for true change in Washington. It is time to come together to address the most pressing issues of our time and to stop the power of partisan politics.    |`|wVik8Fo7aa	Most of the current polls reflect Obama to be far ahead of McCain in most of the battleground states.

Nixon and Democrat Hubert H. Humphrey in the general election, maintaining that there was not a "dime's worth of difference" between the two.    If he were alive today I am sure that he would have to lower that estimate to a nickel.  Even adjusting for inflation.      We have no real choice this election.  They don't even talk abut the real issues like immigration, the occupation of Iraq and the strangle hold AIPAC has on the government at all levels.    To a large extent I blame the press, for not giving Ron Paul the attention he deserved during the primaries.|`|Gy7FsoxUaa	Polls mean nothing. (Look at the year 1948....Truman lost.....then it was discover he won) Kerry in 2004 was ahead.....He lost. The economic issues are important but so is the war in Iraq. Because of the war in Iraq I will vote Obama. (And I'm a Republican) The polls do not influence voting. The polls just give someone a job for a few months. I hate polls.
b1c45661beb2a8e1f192d241d65240cfaa	Very good question, in a sense you are very correct. Where atheism is a lack of believe in a god, ANY god anarchism is a lack of belief in the morality of government, any government. I think the Internet (and the relative anonymity of it) has enabled more people to feel safe expressing their true opinions on the subject and learning that anarchists are not monsters. By the way, many anarchists are very angry that some confused Marxists claim to be anarchists. If you are an anarchist you do not support government forcing people to give up their property. If you support the government forcing people to give up their property you are NOT an anarchist of any variety or type.|`|a919ffaf7b39c58d58f4680cb8cc3324aa	As an athiest I can assure you I find little tolerance in America for my views.  There are people in this country who quite litterally believe I am in legue with Satan.    As for anarchists, I'm afraid I don't know much about them but they are such a trivial force in politics (inconsequential) that I don't think most people even notice they exist.  Other than the dustup at the Republican National Convention in St Paul when was the last time you even heard about anarchists?|`|zftm6qkKaa	Atheist are people that point out the obvious.

As to "society gradually becoming more tolerant of" atheists - would you prefer they were stoned to death? Remember that in this wide world, no matter your religion you are in the minority.    Anarchism is purely political. Atheism is purely theological. Both just happen to believe that they can live their lives perfectly well without any higher guidance, be it god or government.    Well then, theislandofyap, in that case I thank you and apologize.

Contrary to popular believe, moderates are not in the middle of the spectrum. Moderates are to the right of conservatives and just to the left of anarchists as below;    Fascism, socialism, liberalism, conservatism, moderates, anarchists.    To answer your question, anarchists would be similar to atheists as they believe in zero government as atheists believe in zero God.|`|4nD0NJReaa	Sure, Anarchism is becoming more popular.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Wealth distribition upward isn't socialism.  The claim that the Wall Street bailout is a socialist measure is absurd on its face. Paulson, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, who has an estimated personal fortune of $700 million and is a member of the most right-wing administration in US history, has authored a bill that will ultimately divert trillions of dollars to the coffers of the biggest banks in the land. This is socialist?  Such claims display a combination of stupidity and deceit. Those who make them rely on the low level of historical knowledge and political understanding among the American people, for which the population is not to blame. It is the product of the decades-long promotion of political reaction and celebration of the most backward ideologies and conceptions-including hostility toward science-along with the gutting of public education.  A central component of this debasement of political and intellectual life has been the promotion of anti-communism, based largely on the false identification of socialism and Marxism with their political opposite, Stalinism.  The bailout measures are being enacted not by the working people, but are being imposed behind the backs of the people by the most powerful bankers, through their political representatives in both parties. Ownership and control of the financial levers of economic life remain entirely in the private hands of the richest people in the country. Those who have presided over the failure of private firms are dictating the terms of their own rescue at the expense of the people.  The social interests that are being defended are determined by the class nature of the state power that is formulating and enacting the measures. The events of the past month have demonstrated as never before that the American government and the US two-party system are political instruments not of the people, but rather of a financial oligarchy.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct200...  All the campaign talk and media chatter about "socialism" obscures the most fundamental issue: Socialism is not merely a set of technical measures involving state intervention into the economy. All capitalist nations engage in this to one degree or another, depending on circumstances. State ownership does not in any sense define a society as socialist, when the state itself is an organ of class rule controlled by the financial aristocracy.  Socialism means the reorganization of economic life under the democratic control of the actual producers, the working people whose labor creates all wealth. It can come about only through the independent political mobilization of the working class, led by a revolutionary party, which establishes a new and far more democratic form of state, a workers' state, which exercises ownership and control over the means of production. Socialism cannot be engineered through backroom deals between Wall Street bankers and Washington politicians, or through the policies of any Democratic or Republican politician.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/oct200...  Socialism,  which signifies the forcible entrance of the masses into conscious political struggle, portends the greatest and most progressive transformation of the form of mans social organization in world history  the ending of society based on classes and, therefore, of the exploitation of human beings by other human beings.  The solution to the spreading economic crisis and the deteriorating social position of the working class lies not in the reform of capitalism, for it is beyond reform. The crisis is of a systemic and historical character. As feudalism gave way to capitalism, capitalism must give way to socialism. The key industrial, financial, technological and natural resources must be taken out of the sphere of the capitalist market and private ownership, transferred to society and placed under the democratic supervision and control of the working class. The organization of economic life on the basis of the capitalist law of value must be replaced with its socialist reorganization on the basis of democratic economic planning, whose purpose is the fulfillment of social needs.  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/sep200...|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	it is socialism.    thats why most republicans voted against pelosi's and reids bailout bill.|`|AA10774852	To a degree, it is.  But the bailout bill is not for Wall Street's benefit -- it is for yours.  The credit system had become completely clogged with bad mortgage paper, and banks were not even lending to each other, let alone to people like your employer so that he could pay you until his receivables come in.  Furthermore, the government is exacting a heavy price for any bailout money; any company that takes it will be paying dearly over the long run.|`|ci4m7YSNaa	Didn't read your whole opinion part of your question, but I'll answer your question: yes, the bailout was socialist.  Thank you Dems for pushing that one through...thank you as well Pres Bush.  And to the Reps in congress that voted for it, you feeling nervous about reelection with your conservative constituents steamed about this?  I would rather vote for a Dem that opposed the bailout than vote for a Rep that was for it!  Too bad Obama supported the bailout...|`|TPVVuGk5aa	By the Republican definition, how can it be anything other than socialism? rhsaunders says to a degree, but rhetoric from the Republicans these days seems to be dispensing with any notion of degree.

It is the Fed that is running our country, not the other way around.   If the Fed wanted the mess cleaned up they could do it in less than 48 hours, but if they did, they'd lose the hold they have over the nation and it's people.   They caused this mess on purpose to create havoc so the public would vote their man in. They realized that Obama would have a greater following than Hilary, or any of the other candidates, and that they could manipulate him for their purpose. Also by putting him in office, it puts pressure on many of the other so called minorities making their job of forming either a coalition with the bank of Canada to form the NAU or the ultimate recourse of joining the Global union.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because Obama has turned ot to be a warmed over liberal, meaning that he is part of the existing bipartisan system.

As for you being judged. If you call yourself a christian, then you know the bible says you are a light to the world, and the world will look to you to live by the title you proclaim. With that said, It is impossible to be a christian and vote for a man who condones killing an innocent baby up to full term. He did admit this by saying a woman should not be burdened by the original decision she made if the abortion did not turn out.    He also is friends with men like Rhashid Khalidi who openly is against Israel. Israel is God's chosen people, and he said if you curse "Her"meaning Israel, you will be cursed, and if you bless Her you will be blessed. So you see there is no way a true christian would support a marxist man like Obama.    Remember his Pastor Wright with all the hateful messages about Whitey?, and how Americans got payback on 911 for our Government killing Palestinians and Africans?. Once again his Pastor taking up for Palestine over Israel, BIG MISTAKE!     With all Of Obama muslim extreme or socialistic friends, this fact alone should scare you.

Some there got after me for it too but after talking to the person, he said he might end up voting for Obama even though he has always been republican and is pro-life.  He was one with an open mind but many of them do not have an open mind.  The Pastor at this church is well aware of where my vote will be going but when he tells us that he does not care who we vote for but to vote for our values, I am assuming that means to vote for Mccain.

iVv6bFW2aa	You are absolutely right what's going on today is simply a repetition of past history. Gen MacArthur considered a hero wanted to wage war against Russia no matter what the cost. He wanted to be a military dictator but Truman removed him. Sen. Joe McCarthy made mostly baseless charges  about prominent persons being communists. This led to suicide for some, prison for other, and others forced exile and unemployed. During those times the Rosenberg's were executed. Bush/McCain have a combination of traits similar to Bush /Cheney/ McCain and Palin. All vocal red and Muslim baiters, making unfounded charges, warmongering and fanatical religiosity, as well as totalitarianism in the name of security.

As for cowboy movies, unless you have some great insight as to which tribes were assaulted and killed in the 20th century by people watching them, I would guess that premise is faulty.  Communism was a threat to us and total domination was their goal.  Google Nikita Kruschev's filmed speech before the United Nations.  Osama bin Laden has declared war on us and wants to exterminate Israel and all Jews from the face of the earth.  He and his minions murdered over three thousand of our people on 9/11 and you have the unmitigated temerity to say our military is roaming all over the globe killing people on suspicion of being against the United States Military?  What or who has so poisoned your mind that you can actually enjoy the benefits of the shed blood and deaths of millions of our soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice so you can live here and spout this stuff, and then have you disrespect their sacrifice in such a foolish and uninformed manner?

Oprah Winfry says if someone shows you they are a snake & you decide to be friends with them, then they bite you, they will just say "well, you knew I was a snake, what did you expect". So no matter what he said I am not open to him. People like him will say something decent, wise & intelligent once in a while to trick people. To get them off gaurd, to get your off track....Like the low gas prices I believe are just a trick...they are like an abuser who says "look how nice I am" so you think you were wrong & end up being abused more the next time.

AVDkMQPPaa	Estimado compa?ero:  La poltica exterior de los norteamericanos jams va a cambiar;  ellos inclusive continuan hablando como perfeccionar su sistema neoliberal dentro del capitalismo, cuando la llamada ideologa capitalista est muerta.  El se?or Obama, no ser un gran cambio significativo para nuestra Hispanidad, les hago recordar lo mismo de siempre, Obama es una gran orador, preciso, de un vocablo lleno de optimismo y de una gran elocuencia, pero siempre ser partcipe del concepto  del capitalismo.  Los doscientos cicuenta mil millones de dlares que eran para aliviar el dolor del hambre, las personas viviendo en las calles(que ha aumentado en un 30% de su poblacin) fu asignado para la industria automotriz.Tenemos que esperar hasta enero 20, donde jurar   la presidencia, desde se da comenzar el reloj a correr para Obama.  Podemos indicar con completa seguridad(porque Obama pertenece a la clase alta negra de los E. U.) que tomar algunas medidas sobre los graves problemas sociales que tienen, pero estarn estancados en todo el Continente de Norteamerica, por largo rato. Lo que s estamos seguros es que llevar a cabo algunas leves modificaciones dentro y fuera del pas, sencillamente porque no tiene otra alternativa.  El peligro real y maysculo que se v a enfrentar es el enfermizo racismo de los anglosajones, que ha aumentado en un 45% y ha recibido amenazas de muerte, como de igual manera estn asesinando a latinos en el estado de Maine.  En estos das asesinaron a un ecuatoriano vilmente unos salvajes fascistas y la semana pasada a un joven de Honduras, como de igual manera en una tienda apareci un mensaje; "Maten a Obama", y en una guagua escolar deca algo parecido, "asesinen a Obama".  Eses flagelo de la xenofobia y el racismo fu traido desde la llegada de los puritanos a Norteamerica, los mismos que asesinaron a indios y despus celebraron el llamado, "ThanksGiven Day".  Obama es la mejor opcin que tiene el pueblo norteamericano, el peligro es lo que acabo de indicar, que sea asesinado y su presidencia sea corta.|`|3qbwO5hAaa	 Deberan sentirse orgullosos por no haber cometido la gran estupidez de haber elegido a un republicano. Pero debieron sufrir la crisis en carne propia para abrir los ojos. Sin embargo, sigo pensando que les importa un carajo lo que pase en el exterior, mientras ellos tengan lo suyo, que el mundo se derrumbe...  En lo que se refiere, ms especificamente, a America Latina, creo que seguirn los negocios con sus principales socios en la regin, o sea Mexico, Colombia, Brasil, y bueno, prestarn atencin a lo que suceda en Cuba y Venezuela (por el supuesto peligro que suponen para el resto de los pases de este bloque).|`|GRpg2aZkaa	Por mi, esta bien, esta mas buenote, en cambio el otro era muy feo jajajaj|`|PVjfiM93aa	yo pienso que si deben de sentirse muy orgullosos porque ellos realmente lograron un cambio para su futuro gobierno, ellos votaron por una persona que les ofrece un futuro mejor y que eligieron a una persona que si ha seguido sus principios y se ha desempe?ado muy bien en sus anteriores puestos|`|i0WSmPPsaa	Pues yo digo que por cualquiera de los dos que hayan votado sale la misma cantaleta.

Yo vote por McCain pero muchos izquierdistas estaban alegres porque pensaban que Obama iva a ser complice de la izquierda internacional y de los musulmanes fanaticos y terroristas, craso error, aqui uno no debe adelantarse a los acontecimientos,la tarea de este presidente es demostrar antes de todo que el puede seguir manteniendo a los Estados Unidos como una pontencia mundial y llevarla a una posicion mucho mejor, esa es la obra que le espera.  Yo antes de todo lo pongo en manos de Dios, EL ESCRIBE CON LETRAS TORCIDAS.....asi que yo acato su voluntad.  Yo no vote por el, pero ahora hay que apoyar al nuevo presidente y ayudarlo a mandar con dignidad, dentro de cuatro a?os yo te dire si fue bueno o malo.Esa es la democracia , el respeto mutuo, la diversidad de opiones y la libertad de expresion, los gobiernos que no apliquen esa leyes , si son gobiernos malos.|`|2ca1a78f1a56473c00ea28bb58f38dd2aa	no vote por el , sin embargo es importantsimo para la historia de eeuu llegar a esto.   si lees sobre la esclavitud en este pas y los a?os posteriores (rosa parks por ej) te das cta q todo paso hace muy poco.  un paso bueno.  obama y latino america? ni idea! suficientes problemas tendr  q tratar de resolver en este pas, no te parece?   y no veo como eeuu oprime a  latino Amrica.   leo los diarios y veo como por ej argentina tiene enormes problemas pero la raz del problema esta en argentina! a no echarle la culpa al vecino mas...ya estn grandes!!!|`|TSNYm6sqaa	Me parece (desde lejos) que el haber elegido a un hombre joven, preparado y de color, se?ala un cambio de actitud en la conducta del pueblo norteamericano, apenas hace tres o cuatro dcadas marcado por la discriminacin y el racismo.

Saludos.|`|q8IcXOgVaa	Para empezar vamos a llamar a las cosas por su nombre, simplemente para ubicar de lo que estamos hablando: Creme que decir "gringo" o "yanqui" sera ms correcto que decir "norteamericano" porque los canandienses tambin son norteamericanos, y tal vez hasta ms que los propios gringos o yanquis... incluso como mexicano tambin soy norteamericano, no s si han revisado sus mapas o que tal anden en sus conocimientos geogrficos... Que decir de "Americano", parte de mis ascendientes ya lo eran desde muchsimo tiempo atrs, antes que cualquier europeo pusiera sus pies sobre esta bendita tierra. Amrica es un continente, no un pas, desde el estrecho de Bering hasta la Patagonia.    Bueno, una vez aclarado ese error, tan generalizado, paso a responder tu pregunta.    Sinceramente para Amrica Latina va a ser casi lo mismo con Obama en la presidencia, para nosotros, sean republicanos o demcratas, blancos o ******, es casi lo mismo, porque lo que importa ms es su forma de pensar, no su color de piel, y pues aunque Obama prometi un gran cambio slo ser para ellos, no para nosotros. De hecho los demcratas, aunque si bien internamente son muy incluyentes, exteriormente son bastante proteccionistas y nacionalistas.    Pero a pesar de eso y con todo respeto, yo nunca he esperado a que ningn ***** "buena onda" (o del color que sea) me venga a resolver la vida, yo creo que el bienestar de mi familia y de mi pas y en general de mis pases hermanos, est en lo que hagamos nosotros da con da, en aportar da a da lo que yo llamo "mi granito de arena" en nuestra honestidad y en nuestro trabajo en equipo, en nuestra visin a largo plazo. Si todos hicieramos lo mismo, si tuvieramos otra mentalidad, otra cosa sera, pero yo trabajo para que todos los da esto pase, y pase pronto y nuestra realidad sea otra, mucho mejor y ms digna.    Elegir a Obama no es algo malo, pero tampoco es para que se sientan orgullosos, al menos no los gringos blancos. Los gringos blancos tratan de fingir que todas las injusticias y abusos que han cometido en el pasado contra tantos pueblos y y pases nunca han existido o en su defecto tratan de justificar lo injustificable, no aceptan la verdad ni su responsabilidad. Ellos se hacen los locos y actuan como si nunca hubiera pasado nada, y ahora si quieren vivir en su "mundo color de rosa", muy probablemente en su etnocentrismo e ignorancia ni si quieran conozcan dichas injusticias y abusos. Yo creo que su actidud no es la correcta y tampoco es justa.    Pero nosotros hay que recordrselos siempre, no por odio, sino porque simplemente as fueron los hechos... o hasta que algn da de alguna forma corrijan sus errores, o los corrijamos nosotros... o hasta que simplemente se vayan al infierno estos gringos. Adems, recuerda que "El que olvida su errores histricos, est condenado a repetirlos"... Esas son mis respuestas a tus preguntas.    ?Viva Amrica Latina! ?Una Patria Grande como la que un da so?aron nuestros Padres, nuestros Prceres!    P.D. La unificacin latinoamericana no est tan lejana ni es imposible como piensan algunos agitados, si en la UE pudieron, con mayor nosotros que somos ms parecidos entre nosotros. No ser fcil, no ser pronto, pero s puede y estoy seguro que ser lo mejor.    Este video musical habla por s slo al respecto: http://mx.youtube.com/watch?v=hcnStZ5Ish...|`|6gi3kMdAaa	Yo creo que si.  Independientemente de aspectos partidistas, creo que es un cambio positivo para los E.U.A. que se acepte la diversidad, que los tiempos en que el presidente solo poda ser de una raza hayan cambiado.    Algo importante es que Obama gan con votos de republicanos que no estaban contentos con el gobierno de Bush.  Esto indica que las personas estn pensando ms su voto y ya no lo hacen por una tradicin.    De todos modos E.U.A. ganaba en esta eleccin con cualquiera de los dos resultados, a mi parecer los dos candidatos son bastante mejor que Bush y su grupito de amigos cercanos, que por acumular unos cuantos pesos ms han perjudicado a mucha gente, de ambos partidos, de todas las razas y de todos los niveles socioeconmicos; y de paso le han exportado la crisis al resto del mundo.
AXCrwjNnaa	Hay que conocer bien la trayectoria poltica de este funcionario.  A mi entender los grupos de militantes ideolgicos de ultra derecha. No va a permitir que su forma de vida anti constitucional y anti humanidad sea prohibida y perseguida por la justicia. Se pide a gritos un cambio mucho mas radical en la actual poltica migratoria de los EE.UU. Se espera que el reino del terror que comenzo luego de la cada de las Torres Gemelas, sea por completo olvidado. Que no haya mas persecucin ideolgica y que la quinta Enmienda de los EE.UU. sea respetada a raja tablas. Que las leyes actuales que coartan la libertad de expresin y que rompen con el espiritu de la constitucin y   querompen con la anterior enmienda. Que en el pasado se defendio con la vida de miles de artistas que fueron perseguidos por el Mccartismo y por otros funcionarios autoritarios dictatoriales.  Volviendo de lleno al tema migratorio, se espera que el voto por el cual gano Obama sea respetado y hasta promocionado. Hablo de que el futuro gobierno tendr que defender el derecho a una vida digna a todo ciudadano sea en condiciones legales ciudadano o en condiciones no legales. Se espera mucho de este nuevo presidente. Se espera que con el ejemplo, lleve a todo el mundo hacia la paz. Porque si en EE.UU. nace la paz, entonces los otros pases lo seguirn sin dudarlo. Ya que el mundo cada ves es mas chico y mas contaminado. Por ende no hay tiempo para discuciones tales como que fue primero o que fue lo segundo.   Entonces hable sobre el tema brigadas ilegales de personas que con sus armas delinquen y se protegen en la idea ultra derechista y racista en contra de los mejicanos y o otros ciudadanos de otros paises que ilegalmente o no tan ilegalmente quieren transitar y trabajar dignamente, ya que la idea principal es que no solo el gobierno respete ese derecho.

You think a trillion dllars worth of pork wll save our economy.  If it was the answer, then it would have worked for Bush !  Da !|`|QlPTVcrHaa	Limbaugh told them to.|`|gZJ1EQx5aa	I believe that is the case. Maybe not the hope of a nation, but most certainly the hope of true, working class conservatives who have been worried for the past few years that their party and its politicians had lost sight of what they stood for. It is nice to see them stand up and say no to these ill thought out stimulus packages. I am all for helping America, but forking no strings attached money over to Amtrak and the banking execs with zero third party oversight is just madness.|`|AA10124897	It will give us great pride when it doesn't work... However we won't stoop to the level of some and toss a "told ya so" around...    Ahhh..Screw it maybe we will...|`|8pt0fYPOaa	Are democrats who call republicans racists, dumb, nazis, etc - are they restoring hope and unity to the country?|`|A6Xjzhdaaa	lol..more like collective suicide of sore loosers...|`|9b4c3cf261f87e8eff03139562cebd19aa	seems like it but more like they can all sit there and say they told you so when all the spending just gets the country in worse shape than it already is|`|AA10382849	The loyal opposition has spoken..your plan sucks

USA and the world is a victim of  Bush!
ktXhbE31aa	Who cares, they are both just targets.|`|4uike3ARaa	Destroyers and frigates in the modern U.S. Navy have a number of duties. One, as escorts and screening ships for carriers and other 'big boys.' That means, last resort, if there's a missile aimed at the carrier, and you can't intercept it, you try to put the destroyer/frigate in front of the missile rather than let it hit the carrier. Destroyers are the prinicpal anti-submarine platform today, although frigates have many of the same capabilities and both are capable of carrying ASW helicopters. Anti-aircraft/anti-missile capabilities on a destroyer are much greater than those of a frigate. Destroyers are platforms for missile launching, especially the cruise missiles used lately against both other ships and shore targets.  |`|AA10652652	Purpose.  The frigate is a coastal patrol ship and are lightly armed compared to a destroyer.  They were originally used to protect harbors/ports.  The largest U.S. coast guard ships are frigates.    Destroyers are meant to protect larger ships and even fleets from subs, missiles, "small" ships and aircraft.  It's said a modern destroyer has enough firepower to sink a whole WWII fleet.|`|SjfSUUTQaa	They are basically the same.  Today's frigates (in the American Navy) were known as destroyer escorts for thirty or forty years.    One navy's frigate is another navy's destroyer.|`|f645ec028c19d84089f57f1c03e81a74aa	My understanding is that a frigate is lighter and faster than a destroyer. A destroyer has more armament.    Please read this:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frigate    |`|9rEI0TnUaa	Frigates are smaller surface combat ships than destroyers.      Prior to about 1980 the US Navy's frigates were bigger than destroyers and then most of the Navy's frigates were redesignated as cruisers and some were redesignated as destroyers.     Furthermore the numerous Knox class of Destroyer Escorts were reclassified as frigates - just to add to the confusion.      Frigates have tradionally be used as escort ships and have anti-submarine, anti-surface and anti-aircraft capability.    In most other navies frigates were always smaller that destroyers and convettes were smaller than frigates.      In the days of sailing ships frigates were full rigged ships where had only one gun deck and they were small that ships of the line but bigger than brigs, sloops and schooners.      
84y9AOSYaa	I agree completely.  I think it's because conservatives are sore losers (or just losers, plain and simple) and they are venting.  Remember, Bush II was the champion of the criticism ='s treason line.|`|mQsF5dLnaa	Stop whining, YA is a cross section of America.|`|9gyhmZIIaa	... uhhhmmm, I haven't seen those questions. Most of the questions on here are about Obama and the majority of the time liberals and Obama supporters flock to them in defense of their mulatto Messiah.

I have done some research on it and the reason is mostly because the conservatives are the poor trailer park trash hill billy rednecks with no jobs, they drink beer and eat grits for all three meals of the day, they have only two teeth in their whole mouth (and they are both rotten), and they have no education past the third grade.

It is happening all over the country.  The more moves Obama makes takes us farther from the lives we know and love.  Our freedoms are at risk.

He inherited massive failures of integrity, competence, and American values when he was elected in November.

Obama sending more troops for war in Afghanistan (same as Bush) btw what happened to bringing all troops back home?  Obama second stimulus package worth 700 billion (same as Bush with 1st one)  Obama trillion dollars budget spending (same as bush)  Obama & democrats want oversight of Wall Street (Bush tried twice to pass a similar law ... rejected by ... Democrats because? too much oversight by the Government LOL so F... funny)    So you tell me what has he done that is different? Oh yes ... Embryonic stem cell wow ... raise babies for organs NICE!  Eliminate our nuclear arsenal ... yeah and you truly believe that the rest of the world will oblige huh?     I don't believe that Yahoo is overly conservative nor liberal ... what i believe is that there is way too many morons on Yahoo who pretend to know everything.  Go ahead ...

They should be giving up their multi-million dollar salaries and feeding some of their wealth back into the companies they have so badly mismanaged.  What a bunch of buffoons!    Do I sense that the buffoon Bush is in concert with these 'good ole boys'?|`|4912e24c0a8da37575e0a7d0c1180604aa	i think it's a good effort,well looks good on the suface|`|U3wrQ8Q2aa	i'm wondering why there were getting a bonus to begin with.      if it is automatic regardless of performance / results,  then it isn't really a bonus any more is it?      way little.  way late.

President: No, we have to cut too many jobs and it would look bad. But don't worry, you'll still get your yearly birthday bonus.  As IF the CEOs would denounce their own bonuses. Ha.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	I can not imagine how things can be structured in any other way. I don't understand how these republican Presidents can do as much damage as they have done & walk out of office with a pay check & retirement & everything for them when they were hired to care for the people in the country that they destroyed....I think new rules have to be made quickly. I think businesses like GM should shut down the parts that are not going to be of any value to consumers & just send the workers to work with a weekly unemployment check & an amount to match what they made last year instead of bailout money. There are just ways things can be done with more thought but after 8 years of no thinking it is hard getting the creative juices flowing again....I am not shocked at all by your article but I am shocked at the ones who get away with out having any reponsibility for their greed.|`|UcizgK8maa	What a guy huh? He is playing with our money, that's why. He knows better than to show his real greedy self now. That will come later when we are not looking.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Most of them are or misdirected but some others, conservative leaders and pundits are simply social darwinists. They prefer scapegoating the poor to rally the conservative masses and distract them from who's really exploiting them. The more defenseless, the better the scapegoat, that's what makes the poor excellent targets.  Social Darwinism, term coined in the late 19th century to describe the idea that humans, like animals and plants, compete in a struggle for existence in which natural selection results in survival of the fittest. Social Darwinists base their beliefs on theories of evolution developed by British naturalist Charles Darwin. Some social Darwinists argue that governments should not interfere with human competition by attempting to regulate the economy or cure social ills such as poverty. Instead, they advocate a laissez-faire political and economic system that favors competition and self-interest in social and business affairs. Social Darwinists typically deny that they advocate a law of the jungle. But most propose arguments that justify imbalances of power between individuals, races, and nations because they consider some people more fit to survive than others.  Social Darwinism's philosophical problems are rather daunting, and fatal to it as a basic theory (though some have applied similar ideas). First, it makes the faulty assumption that what is natural is equivalent to what is morally correct. In other words, it falls prey to the belief that just because something takes place in nature, it must be a moral paradigm for humans to follow.  This problem in Social Darwinist thinking stems from the fact that the theory falls into the "naturalistic fallacy", which consists of trying to derive an ought statement from an is statement. For example, the fact that you stubbed your toe this morning does not logically imply that you ought to have stubbed your toe! The same argument applies to the Social Darwinists' attempt to extend natural processes into human social structures. This is a common problem in philosophy, and it is commonly stated that it is absolutely impossible to derive ought from is (though this is still sometimes disputed); at the very least, it is impossible to do it so simply and directly as the Social Darwinists did.  http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_7615...  http://library.thinkquest.org/C004367/eh...  In the United States, far-Right Republicans and Democratic liberals alike have sold many people on the notion that the market should be the main force to drive the economy and define social relationships. They maintain that government should stay off people's backs and out of our wallets. They promote rugged individualism and consumerism couched in terms like "personal responsibility," "freedom" and "independence." "Greed is good!" was the mantra of Michael Douglas' character, Gordon Gecko, in the 1980s movie "Wall Street," and those became the words to live by in the '80s and '90s. The philosophy and value of greed was taken to heart by many a corporate CEO, and, over the past three decades, this twisted logic -- underlined by the values of individualism and the culture of consumerism -- has turned back the clock on human development with devastating consequences  http://www.alternet.org/story/92426/the_...  http://www.wsws.org/articles/2008/jul200...  In the United States, the wealthiest country in the world, nearly 40 million people live in poverty, which for a family of four means an annual income of less than $21,200 a year. Millions more are barely holding on as they struggle every day to meet the rising costs of food, gas, utilities and healthcare.  American poverty disproportionately affects children, more than 12 million of whom grow up in impoverished homes. Other industrialized nations do much better.  In fact, among 21 developed nations, American children fare the worst on health, safety and relative poverty measures.  http://www.spotlightonpoverty.org/why_sp...  Some of the answers here strongly remind me of this point Kar Marx made in the communist manifesto.  "It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.   According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness; for those those of its members who work, acquire nothing, and those who acquire anything do not work."  http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/wor...  Most poor people in the US work hard every day, often several jobs. It's absurd and dishonest to declare they are lazy.|`|l8ooh0Wsaa	What claim do those on welfare have to the rich's funds?  They earned it.  5% of the population pays 50% of the taxes.  |`|ku60akDKaa	The bible say`s if a man can work and doesn`t, let him not eat. I believe if it`s my money and business you have no right to tell me how to run my biz. the only people who need help are the sick,disabled,elderly and orphans,,, that`s it!!!!! people who are abled body can always find work somewhere. People are just tooo prideful to work at lower paying jobs like mcdonalds or waiting tables. So they say I can`t find work. |`|dbe197542dd27a5d24583320cbe6ecd0aa	The problem is that when you create a society where the money earners have to GIVE the money they've earned away, you de-motivate people to achieve.    Instead of improve society, it harms it.    |`|61229a5edd65b7a3460d98d36aeb272aaa	I don't believe there are that many people out there who are lazy. This spread the wealth scenario came to light because that's how secular progressive liberal people believe this country should be. Also because economically times are tight right now and working people could always use an extra thousand dollars or so coming in to help make a couple of car  or mortgage payments and they want change. That's basically why Obama got elected but the problem could be that to give 95% of the people a little extra it could cost many people to lose their jobs and then it won't just be lazy people without money, but hard working people with no way to earn income.|`|IpnHcYT7aa	i shouldn't pretend to know what im talking about, but i hear things, i know some of the facts,and im entitled to my opinion..  truth be told, when i start making my own money, call me greedy, but i dont want to give it away to people who are too lazy to work..wheres the insensitive to work is their getting paid to not work!   ....  "You [should] get what you earn."...i'm a strong believe in that statement|`|SEPvAkBwaa	I understand why people are both for and against it.  I might be ignorant about this, but it seems to me I read in history class that FDR's "new deal" reforms are what helped bring the country out of the great depression, and that was all about getting more money into the hands of the poor.    I do know that for the economy to improve money has to be put into circulation. Most low income people spend the money sending it directly into circulation. Billionaires often sit on a lot of their moeny or even store it in overseas accounts. THe more money being holed up and NOT being in circulation, the worse the economy gets. Also blowing up a missile in the desert or something might be done for a good reason but it costs a lot of money, and boom that money is out of circulation. Think of it like that.     What people don't realize is that people on welfare go straight out and spend their money. That money goes STRAIGHT to the gas station, or to the store to buy pampers , or even to the vets office or chiropractors office or places you wouldnt expect. So a lot of people who have moaned and groaned about government handouts have opened their hand and received that money into their business unknowingly, because people on welfare or govt assistance such as SSI are often shamed out of   being open about it.  The point is if poor people have money they spend it, at YOUR business, keeping YOU in the job you are so proud of having. I agree that people should work for their money, but some people become seriously ill, or have a seriously ill child with outrageous medical bills, or daddy has a heart attack and leaves mum with 4 kids and a min wage job. There are people out there that get in a bind. It happens. A safety net shouldn't be abused, and most welfare reform solved a lot of blatant abuse. It shouldnt be a lifestyle but a safety net when tragedy happens, and believe me Sht does happen, really to everybody at one point or another. Many people lose a job or have some outrageous medical expense or something, that they didn't expect. A lot of people are one paycheck away from being homeless, and unexpected things can cause real tragedies.    I'm not here to judge. I'm a flaming liberal, I hug trees when I walk down the sidewalk. Everybody hates me.     I don't think it should be a lifestyle, but I think people in a crises should have access to a safety net. And when they get working again and back on their feet, they can work and pay taxes and help someone else that needs a safety net who might have an emergency.    as long as measures are in place to keep it to just a safety net for emergencies and help people get back on their feet again, it's a good idea I think.    And you can't bash individuals on government assistance without bashing businesses and politicians who coat their pockets with excessive government paid perks or handouts. I think there is tax money going in and tax money coming out. The question is where is it going out to. I think I would like to know more about how much, on a pie graph, is spent helping poor people as compared to where tax money is going to other things. I would need to study that more to solidify my stance.    Sorry for the essay.|`|lawAg5fYaa	The re distribution of wealth is not a new idea. If I believed 4 one minute that wealth was not acquired by hard work than I would be all 4 redistributing it. The fact is America was founded and made great because of Capitalism.Remember high school economics.supply and demand.That is what has enabled so many people 2 achieve prosperity.It only works if hard work is a requirement.It has somehow become a cultural issue. That's good....maybe we can talk about what that means. |`|ZvlvmxeZaa	I grew up in a single parent household with 6 siblings. My father deserted us when I was 4, the youngest of the lot. My mother suffered a nervous breakdown and lost her job. We survived on food stamps and help from my grandparents while she recovered. I shudder to think of what would have happened w/o those safety nets but I am certain that we would have been split up into foster care or worse. After that she worked a factory job during the day and a waitress job at night just to pay the rent and put food on the table.    Somehow we all survived and I attended college with the help of needs-based grants and scholarships while working a full time job and acquired a degree in finance, worked for a few years at a bank, started my own company with a few other folks and sold it for a large sum of money a few years ago.    Now, neither I, nor my mother nor my siblings were lazy or deadbeats. We needed help and without that help, we become wards of the state. Any God-given abilities that we possessed would have been squandered.     A few days ago I was in a hotel bar when a woman was bemoaning to me the election of a socialist, hell-bent on creating a welfare state on her tax dollars. When I told her my story she simply called me the exception to the rule and that "it wasn't the government's role and that's what churches are for". I don't know when this cynical approach to dealing with fellow Americans who need a hand  became so pervasive, but I pray that it stops. We need to see the other side of the story and thank God for our own blessings without simply dismissing the needs of those less fortunate as somebody else's problem. The future of our country as a land of opportunity for everyone, regardless of social situation or class depends on it.  |`|capqMpiCaa	yeah thats a nice rant but the truth is there are lazy people that sit on their *** all day that will potentially get money.

Some illnesses don't manifest themselves in a manner that you can see.  A lot of people get by only by taking a lot of prescription drugs that enable them to function at a basic level but they cannot hold jobs because they are so dependent on anti depressants they would be a danger to themselves and anyone relying on them.

The vast majority of those on welfare and who support the redistribution of wealth do not want to work.|`|jHWpNL9Iaa	Yes.  There are many disabled people on welfare that can't work.  There is also a problem of getting a low paying job that pays you too much so you can't get welfare, but you are still not making enough money to get by.  It's lame really, and a lot of people think it's just because someone is lazy, but that is a very small percentage.|`|6ELSwKKvaa	 This Republican ideology is annoying to me. The Catholic Church backs the Republican party and they are suppose to be Christian. The passage you stated is from the Bible but it is meant to say if you CAN work, you should. It is not meant to keep those who are unable to work from eating! Christians are suppose to love others and share what they have. The ones who hold onto the notion that handouts are bad, are not following Jesus. I don't remember Jesus telling those who were listening to Him to do some work before he passed out the fish and the loaves! I also don't think those at the wedding banquet were working when he provided them with wine. Also the man at the pool near the temple who was crippled, He didn't  tell him to get a job before he healed him either! Where is the charity and Love from some people who call themselves Christian.     I am a Christian and I believe in helping others. I believe in sharing the wealth. There really is more than enough to go around if those with the most of it, gave some of it to those who need it most. The greatest command that Jesus ever gave was to LOVE. If you love, you will share. If you love, you will follow the commandments. Love covers a multitude of sins.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Those who say that are either stupid or rich people who are greedy and don't want to share anything with others.Like the Bushes for example.|`|dli2L0JYaa	Please sister, take a walk along the Detroit streets and the Bronx streets and see for yourself!

Some today, seem to want to make it a way of life.    Some make no attempt to get employment or try to keep it.    Many use all kind of excuses.     Those are the ones who make it bad for the ones with temporary set backs.     Those are the ones costing those working more and more money.    Those are the ones who are being enabled to continue not working.    When the government stops enabling people, then maybe we all will be better off.    when someone on welfare gets equivalent to someone working a min wage job, and not have to work for it.

They get Money for Housing, Free Food, Free medical, Plus cash. heating assistance, and other entitlements,  and not have to work.       |`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	For even the lowest paid employee, the government requires his employer to withhold part of their paycheck.    This "withheld" amount can often mean having to choose between food for a dependent child or medicine for a dependent child.    Everytime the government wants to raise the minimum wage, essentially they are asking for an increase in the amount of money the government can have withheld, too.      Government is not a charitable entity no matter how much they may try to establish that illusion.    "Government is not reason, it is not eloquence, it is force; like fire, a troublesome servant and a fearful master."  George Washington      "It is impossible to introduce into society a greater change and a greater evil than this: the conversion of the law into an instrument of plunder.     But how is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them, and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime.    Now, legal plunder can be committed in an infinite number of ways. Thus we have an infinite number of plans for organizing it: tariffs, protection, benefits, subsidies, encouragements, progressive taxation, public schools, guaranteed jobs, guaranteed profits, minimum wages, a right to relief, a right to the tools of labor, free credit, and so on, and so on. All these plans as a whole - with their common aim of legal plunder - constitute socialism.    Socialism...confuses the distinction between government and society. As a result of this, every time we object to a thing being done by government, the socialists conclude that we object to its being done at all.    BASTIAT, FREDERIC, The Law        Edit: The bailout is not surprising as socialism is dependent on capitalism for funds. If capitalism flounders from socialist intervention in markets, it's only natural for socialism to to meddle further.    It matters not to me if a government is democratic or socialist, the result will be the same. I'm only interested in proper government.    "I'm only interested in government in the hope some day I won't have to be interested in government."      "When you see that trading is done, not by consent, but by compulsion - when you see that in order to produce, you need to obtain permission from men who produce nothing - when you see that money is flowing to those who deal, not in goods, but in favors - when you see that men get richer by graft and by pull than by work, and your laws don't protect you against them, but protect them against you - when you see corruption being rewarded and honesty becoming a self-sacrifice - you may know that your society is doomed."    Ayn Rand
A4vc2Dg9aa	Why do so few of the People not realize that a Federal income tax is not permitted by the Constitution, and as such, it is illegal.    So the IRS (which is actually a privately owned glorified collection agency) is also unConstitutional. I believe that some taxation rights are granted to individual States, but not to the Feds...    There are legends of the few poeple who successfully won the right not to pay via court cases but I cannot comment on how real these may or may not be.    Apart from that - imagine what a boost to peoples' purchasing power if there were no Federal tax??? That could really put the paddles to the fibrillating economy by boosting purchasing power of the public by about 20%. However measures would have to be taken to ensure that globalization in its myriad forms was not allowed to suck that additional libeblood out of the country.    Increase in demand should be satisfied by locally made products - not cheap imports from Asia - that in turn would create jobs etc. It is easy access to, and cheap import of, goods made in Asia, manufactured there often by multinationals that originated in America but now have plants in China or India, that ruined the American Economy. It is Globalization that gradually broke down the barriers to this unrestricted flow of cheap imports and set the stage for the current decline.    There is little real manufacturing left in the country that once was a world-leader in their ingenuity and manufacturing might.     Instead the industry of manipulating money in the great casino that are the derivatives markets became the mainstay of the American economy, and the real-estate market was sucked into this scheme when "investment-grade" mortgage-backed securities, based in-part on high-risk mortgages, but somehow still capable of an AAA rating, were sold to funds and banks and individuals - and most of these are now worthless paper.     All this bailing out of financial institutions was originally caused by this activity that could be construed as fraudulent. Yet Paulson bails out his buddies first of course - the very culprits whose greed and manipulations caused the problem in the first case.    The People will not see the effects of this immediately - it may take several months for serious inflation to kick in as a result of all this activity, or it may happen sooner...but it is almost inevitable.    There have been rumors that the G20 summit will result in a proposal for a single world currency - one of the primary objectives of the elites and banksters....|`|AA10187742	Well the ONLY way people (the CONSUMERS) get to hold extra monies in their own pockets are through tax cuts.

The tax cuts by Kennedy, Reagan and Bush led to huge increases in federal revenue and sustained job growth and expansions in the economy.  The first time that the budget was balanced was in 1995 when the GOP took over Congess after 40 years of Democratic majorities.  They forced Clinton to sign both balanced budgets and welfare reform.  He and the Democrats kicked and screamed.  Clinton even shut down the government when he vetoed the budget.  He finally accepted the bills and now he and the Democrats take credit for it but still won't admit they were wrong.    What Beinhart refuses to acknowledge is that Democratic Congresses SPENT the increased revenue in EVERY case where there were tax cuts.  Unless and until the Democrats admit that SPENDING is the PROBLEM, this country will never get on the right path.    EVERYBODY benefits from tax cuts.  It is OUR money.    We SHARE the wealth every time we hire somebody, expand our businesses, or just go to a store and buy a car or a quart of milk produced by a farmer.

The two recessions you are talking about would have happened no matter what.  Bush's recession was more caused by 9/11 then by the tax cut.  Two of the three worst crashes were caused by overspending of the people prior to the piper being due.  If you look at what happened in 1929 and today there are many similarities including banks lending far more money than they had on hand.

Supply-side economics (Reaganomics; voodoo economics) is a politically convenient tool used by Republicans. This "theory" of economics allows them to substantially decrease taxes on their base (the wealthy elite of society) while giving plausible credence to the idea that tax cuts benefit everyone via the invisible hand of the "trickle-down" phenomenon. No (and I mean no) mainstream economist at any reputable institution believes in supply-side economics. This fact alone should raise some eyebrows.     For a great discussion see Paul Krugman's "The Conscience of a Liberal" and Jonathan Chait's "The Big Con."

When I was twenty-two, Nixon started this proposition by devaluing the dollar in 1973 and he did it to curb inflation directly related to the Vietnam War. It didn't help then, because all it did was to delay the inflation that was at the economic door - until Reagan took office and we had double digit inflation. As of today, the money we have is basically worthless because we don't have a gold standard and have little to back up the value of the dollar.  Personally, I think maybe a one-world economic (money) situation might help - for awhile, but what then must happen is the control of the horrible greed we have everywhere.

However, it would lead to increased control a-la 1984. With a single currency you would have to have a single authority - a world-wide central bank - to control it. There would be no more currency speculation or offshore tax-havens. There would be nowhere to hide your wealth from the government.    The next step would be to eliminate actual currency and to make money entirely digital, so the government would know everything about all transfers of money, and the step after that would be the final aim of The-Powers-That-Be, and that is to get everyone microchipped.     After that nobody who is not chipped could carry out any financial transactions, and the government would have ultimate control over everyone.

iVv6bFW2aa	Probably for two reasons. One is that Bush probably paid off some of his cronies in Iraq, including Halliburton. The second reason  is that Bush  and/or the Department of Defense did not provide adequate oversight. Similarly of a gun dealer who sold weapons which were old and did not function.

That is the example I am giving...This is a nation of laws..We have elections and propositions that people vote on..So when it doesn't go in their favor, the Gays act like a brawling facist mob and attack anyone who feels differently.

Think about it: The Constitution guarantees that you cannot discriminate on the basis of religion. If the majority passes a vote to add this text: "only judeo-christian religions will be recognised". You would have managed to eliminate the rights of anyone who is not a christian. You would have had a majority vote so you could say it's ok - but it still goes against the very reason the Constitution exists: to protect minorities.

If it is a crime to hold fast to our God and our guns then lock me up but don't tell me it is because I feel God made non-whites to be lesser people because I do not feel this way.  |`|Qo8eQ7Roaa	  Because liberals understand, respect, and promote the tenants of the U.S. and California Constitutions, as well as the principals of representative democracy, equality, opportunity, community, fairness, liberty, justice, kindness, decency, and the realization that what promotes the happiness, healthiness, safety, and well being of any group (such as gay people, their friends, family, and  loved ones) benefits society at large.     Furthermore they understand that we do NOT live under a pure democracy.  We live under a representative democracy governed by a difficult to alter constitution that protects the core principals of our nation (and for California, state).  The U.S. and California constitutions (not to mention many other state constitutions) are in part designed to protect minorities from the potential tyranny of a majority.  Ultimately this protects EVERYONE equally, particularly since we are ALL minorities in one fashion or another.   Of course, these core principals CAN be changed, but it's not as easy as having a simple majority agree to do so.  It takes MORE.  A lot more, to change these core principals.    The U.S. Constitution aside (which Prop 8 violates), in regard to the California State Constitution, Proposition 8 was ILLEGALLY enacted.      The California Supreme Court ruled last May that gay couples are entitled to equal treatment in marriage law under the equal protection provisions of the constitution.   The "Equal Protection Under Law" provision on the California constitution is regarded as a core principal of the constitution.  In order to alter any core principals, it takes a much more deliberative process to change it.   It takes what is known as a "Constitutional Revision".       Unlike Constitutional Amendments to the California constitution (which can be enacted by a simple 50% +1 vote on a ballot initiative), Constitutional Revisions require either a Constitutional Convention, or the debate and passage by 2/3rds of both chambers of the California legislature, and THEN a vote of the people at the polls.     Since Proposition 8 is actually the revision of a core principal of the constitution (altering the equal protection under the law provisions to exclude gay couples from equal treatment under marriage law), then it is actually a REVISION, and therefore such a change CANNOT be enacted by simple majority vote on a ballot initiative.       |`|KQ1YoXhSaa	prop 8...undermines the constitution...it pretty much goes around the constitution to amend cali's constitution and the supreme court ruled in may that you can not do that...|`|Cb1qjNehaa	Wow, do you think a vote against religious or racial equality would be passed through legislation? There is so much uproar because people know that this prop was unconstitutional. I'm sure in the 50s that the majority of white voting Americans of that time would have voted against racial equality. Sometimes certain rights need to represented by the constitutional law makers we have put into authority.     The government is not a place to pick and choose sins. It is here to make sure all people are created equal. The constitution applies to EVERYONE, not just straights and Christians. Most of the founding fathers were not even Christian, and they wrote this almost perfect guideline which is still being used hundreds of years later.     If you say marriage is a CHRISTIAN sanctity, then you exclude all other religions from this loving tradition. Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, and so forth. Think back just few years when it was illegal for whites to marry blacks. Those laws were backed by the CHRISTIAN leaders of the time. This is the same situation, and look at us spewing hatred again.    Get a life!! Who does it hurt if gays want to be married? Does it affect you? No! In fact, it would help bolster the economy. Sheesh.    And don't use the "teach it in school" argument. It was already legal in CA and wasn't taught in school then. I was NEVER taught anything about any kind of marriage when I was in school. And if my kids came home asking about it, I would tell them the truth and If I believed so, I would tell them that it was against our religion. End of Story|`|108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	Consider, for a moment, that the people that voted for Prop 8 are in no way affected by the outcome.  They go on with their daily lives, marriages, etc.  Only the people who wanted to get married but can no longer do so have to live with the outcome.  So to those who say "Why don't they just accept the majority vote?"  Because they have to live with it, modify their lives, wonder if their recent marraiges will be upheld, etc.  This has emotional, financial and legal consequences for ONLY the people who wanted to get married.  Those who supported Prop 8 can easily let it go...it never was going to touch them.    |`|u3lcgDEfaa	This film gives two scenarios of Prop 8 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQY6qeUxh...|`|39b0d57b14f9898e56695cb14f1dbf68aa	Liberal way of thinking: IF I DON"T GET MY WAY I WILL SUE!

We have ups and downs, that's the way it is supposed to be.  The market will always correct itself because the peaks and valleys of the market cause arbitrage opportunities that are exploited.  This corrects the market.    Many people cannot handle this roller coaster.  They only like the ups and cannot stomach the downs.  They prefer a flat, slow ride with no excitement or opportunity (socialism). |`|Xn0Lh8T3aa	Free markets can't cause a mess this big.    A mess this big can only be caused by government that infuses the economy with cheap money targeted at a specific market.

2bgQdK5Caa	Yes. I was arrested last year after a Hire-Purchase company rep accused me of theft after i moved house. He told the cops that i had not informed his company i was moving (I had informed them by phone and by letter). I was arrested, put in a filthy cell and interviewed. I was released on bail, the officer kept changing the bail date at the last minute and even tried to get me to accept a caution (to get it over with), i refused to accept it on the advice of my solicitor and the case was eventually dropped due to lack of evidence.    I would like to point out that i was arrested without any evidence (the company promised to provide it to the police which they never did) and presumed guilty until proven otherwise.|`|55q8s8aAaa	I couldn't say...

For a number of years there have been a range of 'absolute offences' - usually to do with technical offences such as not displaying prices at restaurants or misdescribing goods - where the prosecutor has only to prove (beyond reasonable doubt) that the events happened and the defendant has to prove (on balance of probabilities) that it was an error  or mistake and they took due care and diligence to avoid the problem|`|LPO8RlVdaa	Certainly the ethos of innocent until proven guilty is still alive and well, but there is a huge tendency toward witchhunts in this country, especially towards those accused of crimes such as Rape or Peadophilia (look at the Matthew Kelly example, he was accused, had his life ruined by the media, and was then found innocent).     There is also the recent example of the witch hunts against public sector workers who are members of the BNP. You yourself are guilty of being as discriminatory towards people who believe in right wing politics as the BNP are. Look at your recent questions, my answer and the answers of many others if you still don't see this.    Rule Brittannia, although I agree that our justice system at the moment is pathetic and far too lenient, you are wrong to say that in some cases a trial should be done away with. Having a fair and impartial trial, even if undeniably guilty is part of what makes a democracy, part of what makes our country great. It is failing at the moment because of left wing ideologies (i.e. the human rights act) but I would never do away with it. Hung juries are a trademark of backward and repressive societies.|`|2x41IPGcaa	yes and just right too|`|lZ0oztfXaa	No, you are innocent until proven guilty.
72gWADiMaa	I see many good answers here. As an American, I am not in favor of a free market system. Capitalism is, generally speaking (and how i see it), what i can do for myself why stepping on you to get myself higher. It's survival of the fittest on a different scale.    In the 1980s Ronald Reagan came up with his "tickle down" theory: that the majority of the wealth that the top 2% of the population holds will trickle down to those in the middle and lower classes, which turn out to be a total crock. Over the past eight years we have seen the cost of living increase, while income remains the same, or decreases. Also, the richest of Americans and corporations get tax cuts, while the rest of the people see tax increases. Those tax cuts to the wealthy are supposed to allow the wealth to "trickle down," but it is not that way.     But, then again, the wealthy, the corporations, and the lobbyists basically control the government, and what goes on there is reciprocal: the lobbyists/corporations gives tons of money to campaigns, and when a person is elected they reward that company and give them tax breaks, no bid contracts, etc (note: the company who made duct tape donated to Bush's 2000 campaign; after the 9/11 attacks, Bush told everyone to go out and buy duct tape and plastic sheeting to prepare for chemical and biological attacks).    Over the past 15 years or so, Congress has voted to give themselves raises in salary; in that same 15 years, they voted maybe ONCE to raise the minimum wage, even though the cost of living has skyrocketed during that time. That shows where the priorities are.     I believe that a more democratically socialized economy and country would be best (look at Spain, Northern Europe, and other countries). As our health care system stands now, a pregnant woman can't get health care because her pregnancy is considered a "pre-existing condition," which puts both her and her child's health at risk if she can't afford prenatal care. That's just unethical.  Health care (in the US) is all about profit, just like anything else, and that is why the capitalist method is wrong. When you go to the emergency room the first thing they want to see is your insurance. There have been people admitted to the ER and who have died because they did not have insurance and therefore did not get treatment. You'd be amazed (see also the film "John Q").      As to the bailout, i read this theory that if the government took that $700 billion, divided it among all legal adults over 18, each person would get something around $300,000. Then, tax that (roughly 100,000 back to the government), and the people still have $200k to pay off their mortgages (problem solved there), pay off their debts (problem solved), pay off their car, etc, and the problems would be solved (e.g: no bailout, because the people would pump that money back into the system that needs it). That's sounds like a good theory, but i am no economist.    And that's what i think about those matters, without writing an essay, but if you wish to discuss it further, mail me.|`|bYBOUZUyaa	I think GM is going under due to the "Fairer Wage"|`|tmer08ZQaa	No such thing as a free lunch.|`|UxooffHZaa	I don't.

In any event, there are benefits and disadvantages to any system. The more free market system has more upside potential, and with it, more downside potential. The more socialised the economy, the more risk that industries become complacent and less effective.   I personal feel the US has gone a bit too far to free market in the past few decades, and will probably go for a bit more socialization in the next 8 years. But going too far would be problematic as well...  |`|LJd5pUkuaa	I like to dibble and dabble.|`|a1c85fb2fa8cb46f89a4425fb3921555aa	because we are basically greedy SOB's who only care about ourselves....mostly it's because of the wealthy already do not want to lose the power they have....only way things will change is by a revolution...it may not be too far off in reality|`|pElG2K61aa	I have always fared better under a mixed-economy, as have all Americans.

If a person is running a business or has extraordinary skills, he may very well have to take a pay cut in order to achieve a "fair" outcome.    More taxes to support more government intervention equals less money in my bank account.  It only helps the less fortunate.|`|A3UftwH9aa	Actually, there has never been a truly free market economy in America.  The closest we have ever come to that (failed) ideal was during the notorious period known as the Gilded Age, the late 19th century, a period rife with robber baron capitalism, pittance wages & ridiculously long work shifts for the average American, terrible environmental & workplace hazards, and weak, almost nonexistent government oversight.  Taken those results into consideration, I don't understand how anyone can advocate a return to that disastrous experiment.  This was the motivation for the formation and rise of unions and, subsequently, the new middle class which was created as a result of improved wages, workplace environments, progressive taxation, & other social safety nets that were, themselves, most responsible for the economic prosperity in later times.    It is also naive to believe that there isn't much government intervention in the markets here Stateside.  It is simply a matter whose side the government favors.  Here, it just so happens that the US govt intervenes on behalf of the large, influential corporations and investors as opposed to the interests of the consumers.  
rLP9wjPtaa	Communism: political / economic systems based on the concept of central planning, to everyone according to thier needs, from each according to thier abilities, or however that goes. Basically, a cool concept devised by some folks who had good intentions, but generally has been used by some pretty evil perople as a way to gain authoritatian control of peoples, and so far has been generally proven terribly ineffective in practice.    Socialism: political / economic system based on a larger role for the government, but generally not as associated with authoritarian governments.    Cuba: country a few miles south of Florida, communist government, nice beaches and cigars, but the people are poor and subjected to authoritarian and draconian rules, such as not being allowed to have cell phones. I think they suffer from poor food production resulting from communist land reform schemes that allow fertile land to go fallow, which requires them to import food. Good music, food, etc, bad government.    But of course this is a simple analysis. I mean, we do have here classes such as history, which provides historical references to these things, such as when the cuban revolution occured, etc., political science classes which would have gone more into the original writtings of Marx and others, economics classes which discuss things like the pros and cons of the role of government in the economy. I know you'd like to pidgeon hole americans into a nice neat box, but chances are, there are as many different answers to your question as there are americans...|`|gJzEAvNTaa	communism: a good excuse for waging war   socialism: FDR was a socialist, his new deal spread the wealth, but he called it entitlements  cuba: castro annexed the mafia's casinos and establishments, so America sanctions them even today|`|c3vPZfghaa	In school I was taught that communism was collectivism and it was bad.  I grew up, went to college, and learned the difference between the two.    At home I learned the same watching Rush Limbaugh with my father, until I started to question Rush, and research what he was saying. When i realized he wasn't as right as he claims, I quit watching him and pretty much all other media as well.  I took to researching facts for myself, and was denounced as a lib.    As far as socialism, I was taught that it was synonomous to fascism. Again, when I actually took some political science classes, I realized how misinformed that idea was, and that the government and anarcho-capitalists try to keep your views very narrow and very inaccurate.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	I was in grammar school during the Cuban missile crisis, but we were so young that all we knew was that something important involving President Kennedy was happening and the teacher told us "it" (?) would probably be all right. (We had bomb drills then.)    I was taught that communism meant that everything belonged to the state and that they forbade the practice of religion and persecuted people who tried to go against them. I was taught that the USSR wanted the destruction of the US (Krushchev's "We will bury you" was a very recent statement to us).     I actually did not learn that much about socialism, or maybe I just was not paying attention.     Most of what I know about Cuba is from Cubans who fled when Castro came to power. They had to leave and came here with nothing.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	I was taught quite a bit, but I'm tired of typing now so I won't go through all of it. But there was a definite US slant to everything meaning every single thing communist, socialist, etc was evil no matter what might have been accomplished especially in places like China. So, basically I was taught mainly BS. I didn't and still don't buy it all because I was also lead to believe we would all die in nuclear war too. I'm 50 or will be in July so i grew up hiding under a little desk as IF that was going to save my little butt.  To those who think communism completely failed just remember that China is still to this day a very communist nation and not doing to terrible.  The soviets collapsed because they never learned how the world economy worked and put almost all their eggs in one basket and spread what resources they did have way to thin..

In reality he started another dictatorship, nationalized industry, was massively corrupt and built up his personal income with government coffers. In the 60's, however, he emphasized medical care and education, and Cuba's universities and hospitals are among the best in the Carribo/Latin American sphere.    *edit* oh and I certainly learned enough to not make the same mistake many of these people are, presuming the U.S.S.R, China, Vietnam etc. were Communist countries, when they were in name only|`|4GIiYfPcaa	The Cuban misslie crisis, hundreds of thousands murdered his concentration camps and execution squads.

Cuba  was known as a communist country and Evil; the bad guys! what i learned about Socialism and Communism was self taught ie; reading political science books and alternative news.

Yet, America has a rich history of socialism and working class struggle.    "To hell with war, to hell with all who crave it.  When masters rule the world no more, we'll need no wars to save it."    Quote from Eugene Debs - stood five times as a Socialist Party candidate for the Presidency between 1900 and 1920. On the last occasion, he achieved a million votes. (see source)    Now flying the flag for the left in the presidential campaign was Ralph Nader - not on an explicitly socialist ticket though - probably due to the hysteria against Communism whipped up by the Cold War. He acheived 600,000 votes - despite the obvious desire to vote in Obama, as anyone has got to be better than Bush.    I think voters will be disappointed by Obama and some will start looking for a real, third party alternative. The Democrats offer nothing really different from the Republicans and are funded by and wedded to the capitalist system.    The party I belong to prints a newspaper in America called Justice trying to help build a viable alternative based on socialist policies. Capitalism is failing - we need to start internationally building new workers' parties. When people lose their jobs and homes to the coming recession, they will have no alternative but to fight back and will seek a new political voice.    edit - I think many Americans, like Stan confuse communism with Stalinism. I am also opposed to a small elite controlling things and being privileged. We need true democracy, with decisions being made collectively, for the good of everybody, rather than - as is the case under capitalism - for the good of a rich elite. under socialism, we can plan to meet the needs of everybody and its leaders need to be under the control of ordinary people, not the other way round.    We also need leaders to take the same wage, without any extra privileges as those they serve. My party has this principle, the same principle as the Bolsheviks had in Russia before Stalin took over from Lenin in 1924. It was tragic that the greatest revolution in human history was betrayed by the monster Stalin - and it has taken a long time for communism to recover.    Cuba, although a socialist planned economy, was modelled along Stalinist lines. The fact that it has the best literacy and healthcare in Latin America speaks volumes for the superiority of a planned economy, especially when you consider it is still a poor country.|`|e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	Barely anything in school.    At home, it wasn't brought up much, since my parents were never into politics, only when elections came around.    I learned on my own by reading books and watching informative videos.

RnLbJpvTaa	its not just US media its world media. they only cover his immature outbursts. you should read what we say goes by noam chomsky. im reading it at the moment and it talks in great detail about chavez and how hes not what hes made out to be. like you said hes been elected free and fairly many times. his referendums all pass hands down. he is actually helping the poor through his social programs and not just in venezuala even in the US with the national oil company there selling discounted heating oil to poor americans. he has made speeches on how agression and intervention is not the best course of action along with numerous speeches on how support for 3rd world countrys will go a long way to improving the global economy. but yeah read that books its good. if it werent for his childish outbursts id respect the man a lot more.    nicrage is a prime example of someone who doesnt have a clue. many independent agencies has concluded venezeulas elections have been free and fair. and as to him supporting farc i wouldnt go that far. hes mediated between them and the colombian government and has actually secured the release of hostages. but if we're going to talk about supporting people how about all those dictators the US has supported in the past and continues to support to this day. why dont we talk about that|`|p9qiQFIGaa	They lie and say he's a great, wonderful leader|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	Dear, Dictatorial leaders are usually elected because the elections are crooked and corrupt because dictators have control over everything.

Like almost everything surrounding Venezuela, discussion of Venezuela's economy is almost always polarized, with emphasis generally on the negative. For example, for almost two years, major U.S. media outlets, as well as more specialized publications1 stated that poverty had increased under the administration of President Hugo Chvez. This was false, but the media did not correct its reporting until the Center for Economic and Policy Research published a paper on the subject.2|`|oNEi61iLaa	A dictator can be elected democratically.

However, if you are not referencing that "che", then I offer the following:    First of all, the elections were controlled by chavez, which is why he always wins.  Secondly, chavez has or is attempting to pronounce himself "lifetime president".  That is dictatorship, no matter how you attempt to mask it.    As for what chavez has done, the list is long, but I will point out one in particular.  Chavez supports the gorillas in the mountains of Columbia, who are responsible for much of the drug trade in the U.S., while using the funds from the trade to terrorize the government of columbia.    Chavez is a piece of garbage who needs to be assassinated.|`|4a96649180ef685c3dacc7b7868fa151aa	This sure sound like a great man:    1) Attempted a military coup d etat in 1992   2) Increased his term from 5 yrs to 6yrs, New 2 term limit.  3) passed an act to rule by decree for 1 year.  4) Nationalize the oil wells  5) Nationalize the News stations  6) wants to end presidential term limits (President for Life)  7) wants to strengthen expropriation power (This is a politically motivated and forceful redistribution of private property.

I've heard some of the things that are reported on the American media..pretty laughable.  I remember one time on YA when Chavez shut down a television station for a time because it was biased and everyone on here used it as an example of his "dictatorship" when in fact if a station was a biased as that in the UK, the same would happen. Don't think Gordon Brown is a dictator, although some may think so tell he calls an election!  He's made some good steps with his country, but he still has a long way to go.  John Pilger made a documentary about him, was pretty interesting.     |`|T3shEjIoaa	He has been democraticly elected. That's true, but did you know that:    1) In 1992 Hugo Chvez tried a coup against the democraticly elected president, Carlos Andrs Prez?    2) The Venezuelan Constitution made under Chvez allows a referendum to be made in the half of the mandate of the president to decide if he should continue or be ejected. To make it possible it's necessary to collect signature of about 10% of Venezuelan electors. That's what happened in 2004 (or 2003, I don't remember), but the ones who signed and were public workers were fired.    3) Chvez tried to pass a Constitutional reform in 2007 to give him the possibility of eternal reelections. Happilly it was rejected by the population.    etc.    That doesn't makes him a dictator, that makes him a person who doesn't respect democracy and the opposition.    More and more Venezuelans are getting tired of him and pools show that for the first time since he became president his popularity is below 50%.      And you're wrong when you say that Chvez is respected by the majority of South Americans. A pool from the Latinobarmetro this year in all Iberian American countries showed again that Chvez is very unpopular in the region. People were asked to give grades to foreing leades. Among the 16 presidents listed, Chvez is in the 13th position with the grade 4.3.

qV8Vz36Iaa	Your questions are very insightful. Clearly the official rationale is nonsensical since torture results in false confessions.    I believe that the US is conducting a war OF terror.

The war on terror has no fronts, no uniformed, organized enemy, no specific country and the results of fighting this war without all of the intelligence and information we can possibly get could easily result in the deaths of many more innocent people.

They (The US Government) only has to suspect them of being enemy combatants.        The description is so incredibly vague, it could mean anyone in the USA that does not subjugate themselves to authority.   It could be any authority.      The militia part is creepy.  Right out of Obama's speech:  Expect in a few years "comrades", millions of them, marching up and down the main street in your town, doing, whatever the "comrades" in 1965 Russia, or China right now, do.    A police state.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of signs someone has been planning this for a very long time.           Clip from Obama's speech:  "We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set."    "We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded."|`|3tNTOtc4aa	The torture in Guantanamo goes against everything that the United States is supposed to hold dear when it comes to due process and the idea of being 'innocent till proven guilty'   It is this hypocrisy that makes Guantanamo such a blot on America's already well-stained copybook.

I do not need to do any reading thank you very much - having been a soldier for more years than you have lived I have witnessed things that would have you pissing yourself with fright.|`|u1F5RRReaa	Guantanamo is a wonderful example of American double standard foreign policy, and completely discredits the argument that Iraq was about human rights.    And why I like your questions and answers on here I have to disagree and say that they don't have concrete evidence at all, a lot of people in Guantanamo were lawful combatants who were just too slow getting off the battlefield, hence why they're in Guantanamo, to be sent to a regular jail they'd need to be tried, Guantanamo you can just be chucked away for ever.
aIz1IMCDaa	Yes it would seem the Media, by not reporting much on the civilian deaths, the lack of medical staff/care , the lack of progress in restoring power, water and other infra structure, they are actually in support of the war - which made huge profits for Halliburton and related parties who do well from war...we don't want the kind of protests on the streets that were seen against Vietnam !    George Orwells book, 1984 opens in London, now a part of the country Oceania. The whole globe is divided into three countries, Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia all perpetually at war with each other. The leading protagonist Winston Smith enters his flat in the dingy building ironically named Victory Mansions and is immediately conscious of the poster of Big Brother with the inscription Big Brother is Watching You. The Party has taken over all aspects of life and is intent on eradicating individuality. Winston is painfully aware of the telescreen, which is both a receiver and transmitter at the same time (NOW TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE). It incessantly relays messages from the Party and simultaneously allows the dreaded thought police to tune into the activities of any individual at any given time. The administration is divided among four Ministries- the Ministry of Truth, which deals with news, entertainment, education and fine arts, the Ministry of Love which maintains law and order, the Ministry of Peace which wages war and the Ministry of Plenty which handles economic affairs. The very vocabulary of the people was under Party Control; a system called newspeak was encouraged. One of the most dreaded words in the arsenal of Newspeak was the most heinous offence according to the Party  that of thoughtcrime which was sure to be punished by the Thought police. The slogans of Newspeak are War is Peace Freedom is Slavery and Ignorance is Strength.     And here we always seem to be involved in some kind of war, where liberal is dirty word, where the government has us under surviellence (for our own safety and to protect our freedom), where despite throwing the most money in world in educating our children we are languishing at number 21 in education performance, where the serious magzines are all but vanished ... I need to hear more about Brad, Jen and Angie...)  Anyway according to John Hopkins Institute as many as 654,965 more Iraqis may have died since hostilities began in Iraq in March 2003 than would have been expected under pre-war conditions, according to a survey conducted by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Al Mustansiriya University in Baghdad. The deaths from all causesviolent and non-violentare over and above the estimated 143,000 deaths per year that occurred from all causes prior to the March 2003 invasion.    not too pretty eh ! acceptable collateral damage ?  |`|MIROMbMAaa	O K name one American civilian on 9/11 there were 3000 OK just name the little 9 mos old that was in that plane Ok name the 2 year old boy Ok Name me the little 9 year old Russian girl who your brave freedom fighters were able to look in the eye and blow her head off What was the name of that old white American man those brave freedom felt the need to cut his head off and hold it in the air with a smile on his face Your brave freedom fighters run and hide with their women and children best to lay down your weapon then to fight behind your women and children|`|iVVUgIm3aa	Yes because in Iraq alone over 100,000 innocent people have died.

But if I remember correctly, there was an understanding towards the beginning of the Iraqi war that we would not see the dead being brought home.

I believe PBS (MacNiel Leher News Hour) runs a list of all the fallen soldiers every Friday after the news.|`|X0wJpJ9aaa	No, i do not think so.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Not at all.

And in times of hardship people will look for scapegoats, they remind me of the Nazi's in the nineteen thirties going on about how great their country once was and how they are going to make it great once more.    Its all a load rubbish, their underlying agenda is hatred and this will all come out if they ever came to power, and just as back then in Germany they will keep this from the people until they are firmly in place.

They are just naive and have the intelligence of a four year old, its not their fault.
AA11863673	Heard only her sound bites. She spoke at a Quaker's meeting recently and by all accounts her talk was received well.She spent time answering loads of questions.    I admire any MP willing to quit a seat of government on a matter of conscience and principle.     Her autobiography I think will be a good read. What little I have heard from her she strikes me as a kind of female version of Tony Benn whom I also admire. |`|DQpPRg9caa	I have met her and on an individual level quite liked her. However, for the most part her politics are wrong headed although she was right about the Iraq war.|`|wlqUMBZbaa	She has my respect. I believe she is a good MP and isn't afraid to say what she thinks.  Don't agree with her views all the time, but Westminster could do with a few more Clare Shorts |`|0bc16da7336d1bca831672a954fdc0deaa	Yes, Clare Short MP is a principled woman and a gutsy lady.

(it was high above the bar)  She did`nt like it but none of the women members had ever complained (there had been one up for many years) Claire Short climbed on a chair and pulled the calender down. It had absolutely nothing to do with her, she just had to interfere. I, being on the committee of the club wanted her barred for doing that, but was out voted because she was a politician !|`|OPzH4ih0aa	I don't even know who that is, so I can't comment.|`|3tNTOtc4aa	She was one of the few Labour front bench MPs who openly disagreed with Tony Blair's idiotic plans to invade Iraq and for that she must be respected.

EAjTiYj0aa	There are several people posting on this site who claim the BNP have a hope of going from no MP's or MEP's as they are now to winning a general election in the near future.One of the most stupid theories I've ever heard.|`|3tNTOtc4aa	What I find laughable about these idiots is the way they align themselves with far right organisations such as the Neo Nazi movement.  Truly pathetic when one considers that their grandfathers and great-grandfathers probably fought and many of them died in two world wars so we could rid the world of Nazi fascism and thuggery.|`|BURJLYSWaa	Dunno, ask them, you'll find their contact details here:  http://wikileaks.org/  Don't expect much sense.|`|jBARKlmAaa	Fascism hasn't been defeated, if you know the true sense of the word then you could argue not only the UK but America too is a fascist country    http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Fasci...    edit - I have checked out the BNP website and its a poor excuse for a so called political party, it has nothing to do with Fascism but EVERYTHING to do with isolationism and misdirected nationalism, the BNP are a joke    Not that im a fascist either but fascism is COMPLETELY seperate from the BNP in the correct sense of the word and ideology|`|40STiGmvaa	Fascism is not a popular political ideology.

And why is that people feel that the answer to this question to to say stuff about the Labour Government, that it is somewhat fascist and is totalitarian..nonsense!

I frankly don't think we are going to see a lot of positive changes with Mr. Obama either. The government in the U.S. is just plain broken at this point...and it is only going to get more so until the people have had enough and decide to really look for change. Mr. Obama is not it. Nor would McCain have been it....nor anyone else that was running. This year, the vote was really for the lesser of two evils.|`|3BvJQwfXaa	You must misunderstand how most americans feel about bush.  His popularity ratings are low because the economy is doing poorly and the price of gas has gone up, and because whereas before people were enthralled by the Iraq war, they are now bored by it.

We haven't decided who to aim him at.    Do you want him?|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Absolutely! More than anything, I will be glad when Obama brings our troops home because the price of this war is one neither we nor our children can afford. To my friend Marvan, when's the last time Bush attempted to find Osama Bin Laden? When's the last time he tried to create new jobs in alternative energy?

A3UftwH9aa	-Shameful?  Yes, but don't expect hardcore Bushbots to be repentant for their idiocy.    -I'm not necessarily "glad" that Obama won, but considering the alternative, I'll be, at least, content with his presidency.  I'll give him a chance.    -Nope.  The economic crisis has only reaffirmed my long-held view that a runaway "free" market tends to create more problems than it does fix.  Inevitably, the resources and means of production become concentrated within a very powerful few entities, leading to stagnation in innovation and growth.  (See the bloated and aging American auto industry as a sad example.)      -As for a lack of a universal health care coverage system, there is simply no rational explanation.  The majority of Americans want it, but corporate lobbyists and their cronies in DC spend boat loads of money to ensure that the "for-profit" status quo remains in tact, even while the majority of their customers find it increasingly difficult to even afford their services.      -It's not only hypocritical; it is self-defeating.  Camp X-ray has only helped to create MORE terrorism, not hinder it.      -Surprisingly, yes.  One can be a fervent Christian and be a war hawk.  What matters is how the individual adherrant interprets Scripture.  Since the Bible is chock-full of contradictions and supernatural quackery, I do not give much credibility to any "scriptural" or other religious arguments in favor or against warfare.  (Of course, I'm not a Christer myself.  LOL)    -Unless if the hunter intends on consuming his kill, I find it quite wasteful on his/her part to just let it rot.  Even indigenous tribes around the world that frequently hunt at least put their kill back into the food chain.  Again, even fervent Christians can still be avid hunters.  Unlike in Judaism or Islam, there are no strict dietary guidelines either explicitly outlined or implied within Scripture. However, I guess one could stretch a bit and interpret the myriad of "trophy" animal heads on a Christian's wall as "idol worship," which is a violation of the First Commandment.   LOL 5X!|`|ibzgcbcTaa	Please ask one question at a time.|`|JDctw6SVaa	No  No  No  I have health insurance....so can everybody else if they get off the couch and go to work.    I could give a ratass about the treatment of mass murdering terrorist.    How can I be a Christian and support a mass murdering dictator?    I killed 6 ducks this morning and a deer Saturday....what do you think?|`|AA11702773	1.  Not particularly, everyone is entitled to their opinion, even you.  2.  No.  I wrote in Ron Paul.  3. That is a ludicrous conclusion since it resulted from government intervention through the Fed and social engineering programs, so:hardly.    4.  Because they are idiots and if you think our economic problems are big, wait until their entitlements come due.  Can you say 'economic servitude'?    5.  Yes.    6.  I can't.  Other Christians do, mostly I think because of the church teachings about respect for leaders and trust.  I have little of either.    7.  For entertainment?  Do you mean for sport?  Not if you eat them, no.  Some other animal kept in relatively 'cruel' conditions to the free running elk would be otherwise killed, unless you are a vegetarian, which kills brain cells.  (Are you a vegetarian?)  As for Christians hunting, always have, so why not?|`|1b835847634639833ab263016ee078fcaa	No.  No but I'll deal with it.  No.  I have health insurance.  I pay for it through my place of employment.    No.  Yes.  We do need a logical plan to get the h*ll out of there though.  Although I would not go hunting myself, I am not against hunting.|`|AA12365543	I havent come across many Bush supporters in years.    No I'm not glad Obama won.    No, the economic situation taught me that the government should let businesses run as they please rather than imposing quotas on them. Remember it was bad loans that started this and that was due to Clinton forcing banks to take risky loans.    My state has mandatory healthcare and it has put the state in debt. Anyways Europe has been cutting from universal healthcare since 1993 since it is unafordable.    yes, Guantanamo bay was wrong, but it is technically Cuban territory which is why they got away with doing it.    I'm an atheist so I have no idea and don't care.     Hunting animals for any reason is cruel. I still hunt.  The bible does ban hunting for anything but food though, so Christians are hypocrites if they hunt.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	If you don't live over here shouldn't judge us. We are just trying to survive like any one else. Were not monsters.|`|85kWzSzuaa	no  no  no  no  no  yes  no  yes|`|tP8W6Q1Qaa	1) there is a lot more than you might think.  2) Absolutely NOT!  3) If the government would have kept out of the private sector we would not be in this mess to begin with.  4) I work, I have health care. simple. Who has the best doctors in the world?  5) I don't think they tortured them enough.   6) I support Iraq, over 27 million people are free, plus the genocide of the Kurds was stopped - pretty proud of that and I am christian.  7) Hunting for entertainment is cruel, hunting for food is righteous. (Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day, teach a man to fish and he will eat for a lifetime)  |`|sCYCsgkHaa	Yes  No  Yes  greed  no  yes  no, animals hunt each other too.|`|oNEi61iLaa	- Yes  - Yes  - No  - Bush administration's fault, Obama wants universal health care  - Guantanamo is in direct violation of the Geneva Conventions, this is a disgrace to the United States and Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld should have faced serious consequences for it. Obama wants to shut it down.   - Yes, if you were 100% pure follower of Jesus' teachings you would be a pacifist and object to the war... but Christianity is open to all kinds of interpretation, most Christians are not pacifists  - Its not something I would ever do but I don't think it should be illegal or anything. Again Christian has come to be a vague term, maybe some Christian groups are against hunting but not all are.|`|3oz4r6Nraa	Do you think the amount of Bush supporters left in the US is shameful?  -No, people are free to think what they want.    Are you glad Barack Obama won the presidential election?  -Definitely not.    Has the economic situation taught you that a capitalist free market economy is bound to be a failure?  -Heavens no, capitalism is the way to be.  This is the fault of predatory lending.    How come you still don't have some sort of universal health system as you like to call it but many other civilized nations do?  -Because it's not the American way to do things - we have a private health care system that works just fine.  Universal health care creates poorly functioning government-run hospitals and incredible waiting times and limited doctors.  People in other countries come HERE to get good treatment!    In America, health care is available to everyone, you just have to pay for it yourself.  I also don't think it's constitutional because health care insurance is not a right under our constitution.    Do you think Guantanamo is hypocritical of the US, with the US claiming to be all about freedom and democracy?  -No, criminals forfeit their rights, especially foreign criminals.  Our servicemen acted inappropriately but that happens everywhere, not just here.    Can you be a Christian and really support the Iraq war?  -How on earth are they mutually exclusive?  Why wouldn't you?  I don't support the war and I'm not Christian, but I don't see what the religion has to do with a strategic military decision.      Is hunting animals for entertainment cruel? Can you be a Christian and really do such thing?  -No, how on earth would we get food if we didn't eat animals?  It's a sport, but every hunter I know takes that meat and uses all of the animal and cooks it for his family.  Again, what does religion have to do with anything?  Jesus ate meat!|`|LK3GOgS5aa	Record low unemployment and inflation, I rather have a big one  go off,     Economically, the US is the only player,|`|15073d45488fae699bfcc309901aa76eaa	No, it's a free nation, we may support whom ever we chose.    I think it's a step in the right direction    No, it's taught me that Government only making policy for the benefit of large corporations is a failure.    Because we have freedom of choice, why should I be mandated to be in a system I may not support?    Yes I do, which is why Senator McCain missed a great opportunity to be more vocal of his promise to close Guantanamo    I am neither    Not sure what you are referring to here, and what it has to do with the United States? But killing for "entertainment" as you so call it is wrong.    I assume you are Canadian, yes?|`|j1PXygGQaa	No.  Not Sure yet  NO  Because we have yet to be in a position where we could do such a thing.  No, they are not   I am not Christian and support the war  Most people eat the animals they hunt.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Yes, yes, I don't know, I don't know, yes, no, yes, and no

In 26 days she'll be on her way back to Alaska and hopefully we in the Lower 48 will never hear from her again.

So, like you said there are less than 30 days to go.  If you want to win, you start getting into it to sway people your way.

From all the way in New Zealand, Sarah Palin has been suggested as being a bit naive (I would say a barbie doll) and that spectacular display of being able to read a newspaper was facinating for all.  Cheap tactics can cost an election and unfortunately I think she may have done it for McCain.    I shall enjoy watching from the sidelines to see what happens.|`|9d676a1d9ea394e4ed9a36f669c2c09baa	Because Americans have a short attention span.  The smears about Obama are untrue, but if they say them right before the election, people won't have time to fact-check them before they vote, and they'll be discouraged from voting for him.

January 20th can't come soon enough.|`|GMA9erCDaa	Gitmo has been a real blemish to the US reputation and just another reason everybody in the world is glad the ignorant cowboy from texas is leaving office soon.|`|Tf0w18BDaa	Before you comment on the "torture" in Guantanamo, please take a moment to consider the treatment our own troops suffer when they are captured.|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	No, it's a foolish idea. Please cite a law that guarantees these war criminals rights under our constitution. I suppose you would propose releasing war criminals who have killed our soldiers to go back and kill more like 50 of the 125 already released did? Perhaps your boy Bill Ayers would like to "sponsor" them as good citizens? That makes you a brain surgeon.|`|KeDuKdgCaa	Yes, and I also think it's safer to have the released prisoners in America rather than throw them back into the sea of Muslim Fundamentalism where they would be taught how to become REAL terrorists.    I wasn't sure about this stance before, but I've done some thinking and most of those prisoners have no connection to terrorism from what I can tell.     They appear to have been victimized by an over-agressive campaign fueled by the Bush Administration and their own neighbors who sold them out quickly to avoid their own false incrimination.|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	Maybe we can release them in your neighborhood! Awful funny their home countries don't want them back at all!|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Why are you so full of hate and anger and lies?  You are attacking good honest, hard-working HEROES who who have kept worthless trash (liberals) safe from evil for 7 years, and all  you narrow-minded haters give them for thanks is more hate and lies.    Meanwhile, you worship a bloodthirsty serial murderer with your avatar.  A man who reported achieved sexual satisfaction by slowly torturing innocent people to death over many hours.  Someone with the blood of thousands of totally innocent people on his hands.  You worship a devil monster like Che Guevara while condemning those who fight for truth and freedom.  That makes you a worthless hypocrite who isn't worth the effort these heroes give to protect you from harm.    You need to do some soul searching.  Then apologize to the good guys and burn your Che memorabilia.  Then you might be worth the effort to protect.|`|28tBprRtaa	just because he claims he  will wait until it happens to celebrate|`|AA11564497	Good luck in the real world Mr. Idealist.|`|OPzH4ih0aa	Yes it is a good thing. They need to be locked up in Leavenworth. And for all you nitwits out there who think there's going to be another terrorist attack, he mentioned the first thing he was going to do was get an anti-terrorist team organized. He's actually been doing that already. And Bush was better, right? If GW Bush was so great, then why is Osama Bin Laden still alive? Also, there weren't any Al-Qaida members in Iraq until we got involved. We created the problem by opening Pandora's Box.|`|BUGuJIk9aa	Yes I'm glad that it was one of his first decisions. Hopefully he carries on the way he is going. |`|pxKUyKIsaa	Yeah but he is going to let the traitors Bush ans Cheney get away with their war crimes. |`|MDFqos60aa	Question is how is he going to do that. has he claimed that he is planning to try them in regular american courts or the kangaroo courts bush set up. |`|f944ef2ed824a553beb9fd82e2cf9c03aa	hopefully he'll move all of those "terrorists" to RED states!|`|1pr5c7yRaa	totally agree|`|anYaLrXxaa	No.  Waterboarding is not torture.  Those terrorists get better treatment than most inmates in US prisons.    Why should POWs caught on the field of battle be given the same rights as US citizens.  If they're caught on the field of battle, they are GUILTY!!!  Screw 'em.    POWs do NOT have the right of habeas corpus or due process.|`|pDU0F2QDaa	Hey remember that time that there was a prison camp ironically called "Camp Justice?"    LOL    Technically, Habeas Corpus can be suspended in times of war or "public danger," according to the Constitution, by means of the .  However, that's very inhumane.    The United States is a nation of the rule of law, or at least that's what the founders intended.    No need to mention the number of laws on the books not even enforced...|`|tnagkORQaa	Yes it sure is - everyman, woman or child should have a right to due process regardless the crimes they have been accused of, regardless their country of origin.|`|5ad5c57d1af2c514e4fa75580fece308aa	You guys live in sugar cookie houses and eat cotton candy clouds. These poor people you refer to want you dead and will kill you if they get a chance.|`|LCqL6Z2laa	We need to release those poor innocent terrorists ASAP!      I hate to see good talent going to waste!    Wouldn't it be ironic if one of these innocent terrorists ended up assassinating Obama!    There's no guarantee these fun loving terrorists will love Obama!    Can't wait to see the End Game.|`|7QuOl3iuaa	Since you are a communist sympathizer, maybe you'd be able to house the gtmo prisoners in your home? I'm sure most of the prisoners would sympathize with your communist leanings and anti-American beliefs.|`|A8ygY9Saaa	Yea, isn't it just though, I heard that every American who protested Gitmo  will be notified to make accommodations ready to house one of those delightful prisoners in their homes, until the Government can figure out just what to do those delightful such peace loving wouldn't hurt a fly, so misunderstood prisoners.  Rumor has it you are at the top of the list oh goody, let us all know how it works out for you.    No need to worry about me protesting your care of that prisoner assigned to you for safe keeping not real sure how long you would last with one of those darlings.    Anymore then I would the governments care of those terroristic characters, whose sole mission is to annihilate the infidels.    So I will never be on that list of potential homes to house the "Terrorist" that you are so concerned about.    Word of advice,. I would not turn my back on your guest.  Good luck !!!!      To bad this is not a real solution to a real problem, I wonder how many of you bleeding hearts would take one of  these killers into your home.  And how many of you would survive for 5 minutes, you offer no solutions only complaints.    These characters are not US citizens, they do not deserve any protection rights under our Constitution.    |`|N7dttJzIaa	Well I for one am glad to see that now we will no longer have to feed them "special" meals, provide rugs and korans and treat them humanely...shoot them all and close up shop!|`|qVYwyrPSaa	Actually it's not a great thing. It would be nice if i could say and think that with the closure of Guantanamo bay that all torture will stop, when in fact the CIA will just send suspected terrorists to places like Pakistan for torture. |`|A3UftwH9aa	It's long overdue.  This camp should have never been erected in the first place (and on "enemy" soil for that matter).      All that Camp X-ray has achieved is in creating MORE terrorists.  Innocents that didn't necessarily have a major beef with the Western world now have taken up arms, aligned themselves with Islamist terrorists and vowed to exact revenge on the "infidels" for ruining their reputations and even putting their lives, and those of their families back home, in danger.  |`|1HQavOGOaa	Yeah, I hope the released Gitmo inmates move into your neighborhood.  Enjoy!|`|AA12191521	McCain also promised to close Guantanamo Bay. Basically we should not be doing anything to prisoner abroad that we would be ashamed to do at home. But you are wrong to call it a torture camp. Those prisoners are well taken care of. But it does send a bad message that we refuse to put our POW camp on American soil. We will still have to house them somewhere. But it should be within the US borders so that we reduce the appearance that we have something to hide. They are prisoners of war and the war is still going on. So they cannot be released. But everything should be above board and visible so these vicious rumors never have a chance to start. And yes you are a dirty communist and so is Obama.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	First of all these are prisoners of war not citizens now America must pay out tax's to get lawyers to represent these terrorists! I don't understand your need to slap this man on the back for a good deed!  I hope they only tax the people who voted for Obama! LOL|`|2Hlctljgaa	I think we should send them all over here and set them all up around the white house. |`|VS0PuI5paa	Yes, bring them all to America and then let them go.  An excellant example of good intentions aimed at the wrong target.|`|JthubNIsaa	Yea. All the innocent guys have been released. That is good. All that is left are hard core terrorists. Obama is naive and stupid.  They very ones he let's go may very well be the ones who try to kill him. Or others for sure. What a buffoon. |`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	I'm sure the terrorists will be very happy.  As a UK citizen I also think the terrorist statement of torture is a red herring to swing public opinion towards themselves.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	Yeah that is a great thing, and it's long past time.     |`|i5F2jwvhaa	Make a list of all that are released    I guarantee you will see their names again involved in attacks on the U.S. or our intrests.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Yeah, I think it's great. I can see the questions now. "Just how much, exactly did you want to propel a passenger airline into a building full of Innocent people."|`|BsQcplTQaa	Now can we get the Muslims to stop torturing people to death?|`|ofP7bbX7aa	You misspelled the name its CHE.  just like Clinton pressured the Israeli to release some political prisoner, they did.  Two of them were the pilots on the planes that hit the world trade center on Sept 11.  These are suspected terrorist, not US citizens. |`|krnrjNfmaa	yeah great right ... just a chance to have them kill not only our soldiers but more Innocent people.    Nothing to celebrate.    |`|jauizC6Vaa	No it's a terrible idea because it domesticates a war issue that should not be brought into this country and handed over to the ACLU. You are one confused lad.
BUGuJIk9aa	What I want to know is why on earth would you name your child Fannie Lou? I hope black people do. Even now they are still looked down on within the US. |`|8qkJIun5aa	Che is a murderer|`|bHI4NLonaa	Not only did he go both ways, but he persecuted and killed OTHER homosexuals for their "crimes" against nature.

At present, there is racism in the USA, but it is far less acceptable.  Remember, the USA has no openly far right political party, unlike the UK.  You could even argue that the UK now is more racist and intolerant of race.

She thinks she has forged a connection with the American people. But it is only because she has been surrounded by right-wing ideologues, both in terms of campaign management and the people who attended her rallies. It will be a loooooong time before America elects such an extreme right-wing candidate again.    So, yes, maybe she should be going moose hunting for a while.|`|AA10284358	I don't know haven't said it and don't intend to. And another admirer of Sarah. Its ok you can say it.

The dems spread that lie that Bush didn't want to "count all the votes" in Florida, when in fact, Gore only wanted to recount the votes in highly democratic counties in Fla., and tried to have the military absentee ballots not counted.

5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	Obama supporters are rationalizing like crazy to cover Obama's fanny on this one but there is NO way.    When Congress passed the first income tax law in 1894, it was declared unconstitutional.  Period.  It took FOUR years to pass the 16th Amendment to the Constitution giving Congress the "power to lay and collect taxes on income, from whatever source derived," because there was so much opposition to it.  The Amendment wasn't passed until 1913.    We have had an income tax for LESS than 100 years.    Taxes have always been used for the COMMON good.  That is, for the things specifically delineated in the Constitution - Articles I and II  - such as national defense, treasury, infrastructure, interstate commerce, the costs of running the government itself.  It has only been since the New Deal that we began to take over the social services sector and that dramatically increased with the Great Society until entitlements have come close to bankrupting the US.    Obama's plans are the FIRST time that there would be a direct transfer of wealth in cash payments from those who PRODUCE to those who are NON-PRODUCERS.  It would NOT be NEED-BASED.    If that is not Marxism, what do you call it???    I have no idea who Barbara West is, but give her a medal.  She's a hero, just like Joe the Plumber.  Pray that there are enough of us on Nov 4 to stop this madness.|`|nr96BgWfaa	No it wasn't wrong, but what I don't understand is why it even requires a question.      All one has to do is hear Obama's comment to know the answer, thus, nix the question and reframe it as a factual statement backed up by Obama's words themselves!|`|k1jwNKbgaa	It is absolutely fair, and it AGAIN exposes Obama as a Marxist!!!    The pure denial of the Obama camp, and his blind followers is just shocking?!?!?|`|P5ZkSjyQaa	About as fair if an interviewer asked Palin about Hitler.  The questions West asked were insulting, yet Biden was kind to her.  |`|c3vPZfghaa	Because Biden went on the show to be interviewed. When you interview someone, you don't spend the entire time trying to trip them up in an attempt to slander someone else.    There is a very big difference between what right-wingers see as valid issues, and what the rest of the world does, obviously.    You people would be outraged if Palin went on CNN and the only thing they asked her about was McCain's roll in the Keating scandal, then assumed that she was trying to hide something if she didn't know anything about it.    By every definition, questions like that, are propaganda. This was a clear case of irresponsible and unethical journalism, and Biden made her look like a fool.|`|BUS5PJEmaa	I think the tone of the interview established that she is not objective.  Given Obama's comments no, if you listened to the entire interview with Joe the Plumber no. Plus she did not treat McCain the same way.     Biden handled her very well. He did not flinch and did not have a problem answering her questions. She did not want to hear the answers she just wanted to attack.

The roots of Communism within the Democrat Party go back to the first Franklin Roosevelt Administration.  The Democrat Party under Roosevelt stole much of its platform from the 1932 platform of the Communist Party USA.  Aside from the Southern Democrats, the Party has been in bed with ComSymps ever since.    The Republican Party initially resisted the Communist influence, but submitted under Eisenhower.  Both parties make their peace with the Red in the Sixties, with Nixon going to Communist China.    Today, the Republican Party has been taken over by the Neo-Cons, who I believe are the descendants of the Nazis.  War, big government, suppression of civil rights, and hatred against Muslims and Arabs.    Now you know what I am voting third party.|`|AA11593583	There's nothing wrong with socialism--- As long as the group is smaller than 20 people.|`|grytfPQRaa	Taxes and tax rates have nothing to do with Communism or socialism.

Latin: Plurium Interrogationum     First you would have to argue that Karl Marx's axiom is equivalent to the term "spread the wealth," which it is not.

"Red-baiting is the act of accusing someone, or some group, of being communist, socialist or, in a broader sense, of being significantly more leftist at their core than they may appear at the outset. The term is used mainly with the intention of discrediting the individual's or organization's political views as dishonest and/or haphazard."|`|AA11301721	We've been hearing this same old rhetoric for years.

You can call it what you want, higher taxes for the rich and lower taxes for everyone else sounds like a good idea to me. If you don't want the tax breaks, don't take them.

Louis Blanc is generally cited as the originator taken from a Biblical context in Acts 2.  I hope Obama isn't trying to install Christian values in our government!!    I think it interesting that the pre-Bush years had higher taxes and a great economy and the national debt was actually reduced.  While under Bush rates went lower, economy and jobs south, debt rose and inflation adjusted spending rose the highest since Lyndon Johnson.  How did that trickle down work?    As far as it being a redistribution.  Most of my rich clients I have spoken to don't have a problem paying an extra $3,000 (in addition to tax already) on $100,000 in taxable income.  Granted most of my rich clients pay a large share of their tax in capital gains and dividend rates (15%) which lowers their effective tax rates.  As an owner of a CPA firm with 10 employees I have no problem paying additional tax if my employees can get health insurance without pre-existing conditions, and our insurance rates are not subject to unknown expenses of the uninsured.    Just an observation - I live on the W coast of Florida.  On perhaps the richest part of town it is evident which canidate owners of multi-million dollar homes are supporting based on the signs.  And it is not McCain.  The middle class are the ones in an uproar over this.  The Economist points out that the middle class here in the States generally think they are in a higher class than they actually are while those in Britain think they are in a lower class than they really are.  Most of us think we are rich, but we are not.  It has been said that the purpose of the middle class is to keep the poor's hands from the necks of the rich.|`|lEaT5q06aa	am not familiar with B.W. but i would think that the answer is sufficiently obvious, that the question need not be asked.    having observed obama for a year: a significant % of his strong sopporters are self described marxists    i have no doubt that he is as well    if he were asked and said no, would that persuade me otherwise?    in light of other evidence, i would say that it would not|`|q4EXFhV7aa	"Fair' only if you COMPLETELY disregard his FULL 5 minute conversation with Joe and COMPLETELY disregard his entire policy plan. We have had a progressive tax since 1916. Obama wants to return to the same rates of Clinton and Regan....was Regan a socialist too?? All Obama wants to do is stop the Bush tax cuts to the rich. McCain ALSO wanted to do so....until he decided to abandon his conscience and run for President. John McCain 2001: "I cannot in good conscience support the Bush tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle class Americans who most need tax relief."  John McCain's 2000 Campaign Rally: Audience member: "Why is it that someone like my father who goes to school for 13 years gets penalized in a huge tax bracket because he's a doctor."McCain: "I think it's to some degree because we feel obviously that wealthy people can afford more."  Audience member: "Are we getting closer and closer to, like, socialism?"  McCain: "Here's what I really believe: That when you reach a certain level of comfort, there's nothing wrong with paying somewhat more."    The FACT is, we pay 5 times more for corporate welfare than we do for social welfare in this country. BOTH parties are offering some form of 'socialism'.....either you vote for the party that is offering social welfare and help to the middle class, or you vote for the party who is offering corporate welfare and help to the upper class. Under John McCain's plan AND under the past 8 years of Bush, 67% of CORPORATIONS DO NOT PAY TAXES.

Marxist ideology is being taught in colleges and universities all over this nation and has been for years.  The truth is that we already employ many Marxist ideas thanks to advances in liberalism over the past few decades.  The one thing we have managed to avoid is outright government ownership of our private property and it's coming soon, thanks to the bailout (jmo).  All that is needed is 2 or 3 far left liberals on the Court.
c6ZaXekbaa	"You're either with us or with the terrorists."    "god bless America."    "love it or leave it!"     Conservatives are so stupid. Even if I think Obama is doing a good job I could never muster the shame to say these kinds of phrases. But, that's what happens when unyielding, dogmatic conservative followers meet authority. What's that they say: conservatives never met an authority they didn't immediately revere? See "authoritarian personality" and "social dominance theory."|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	I don't think that Republicans are Patriotic because they do not support what makes America a country . And that would be our people. Our government would be nothing other wise.  I use this example because I remember it well with out having to look it up.   Republican  Romney bought American factories cheap / Put Americans Out Of A Job. Then resold those factories at a great profit to foreign investors. He doesn't even bank in the US. I don't think Romney cared at all about the people who lost their jobs . So a vote for a Republican is a vote against a healthy economy .  It doesn't seem to bother Republicans that Sarah Pain has close associations to the Alaska Independent party that wanted to secede from the United States.  It would seem to me  that many Republicans are just out for themselves. And they can not grasp the difference between earning an honest living and profiteering at the expense of the people here in the USA.  My opinion|`|35ZJauLkaa	This question goes both ways. Liberals, if you're so patriotic, why didn't you support your President who was in office for eight years.|`|MEReSvZeaa	I do, and I have no problem with it.    But don't use the word patriotic until you can manage to thank Bush as he leaves.  It works both ways.

Prosperous:    DOW 14,000 (we'll only see it under Bush)  Unemployment: 4.8% (historic low)  No inflation  No stagflation  Close to the highest standard of living in the world    Safe:    No terror cells left in America  90+ attempts at further attacks, all foiled  al Qaida set back 30 years  All terror around the world on the run  More allies fighting terror with us than in the Clinton years    Yes.  You have to be a liar to be a liberal these days. The facts always work against you.  (I don't think you love your country, I think you love yourself.  You love America only when you get your way.  You're not worthy of the advantages you have here.)|`|IQIMyE5Naa	I agree with it all but the end...

pe0PY76Waa	The difference is that Obama's association with Ayers was tangential and was not based on common ideology.  McCain, on the other hand, went to great lengths during the primaries to associate himself with Bush. He may have been doing so only to secure the nomination, but it came back to bite him.|`|bMn1Y0vXaa	All it means is one got more media attention than the other.    Issues are quite powerless w/o the media.|`|Svanlzg7aa	Because his loyal followers didn't care about any of the negatives about Obama. All they saw is dollar signs from all the money he planned on taking from the rich and hand out to everyone else.

It was an irrelevant relationship. People are sick of the Karl Rovian fear politics. Americans have fallen for this for years by Republicans and look where it's gotten us.

There was nothing there.|`|RqOET8pnaa	It is because the media would not investigate the relationship.

PKfh0jhLaa	She doesn't have to.....  all she has to do is wait for him to DIE.  He is a war-scarred old fart.  He probably will not last through one term.  and that would make Palin PRESIDENT.  Think about that people!  The figurehead, the face of AMERICA to the rest of the world, would be Palin... NOT A GOOD IDEA!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes,and she is counting the minutes to see when he croaks and she can take over. But too bad for her'they'll both lose.
vu6EFFwHaa	Hey more time to hunt Moose!|`|00B394HBaa	Nope! If Obama wins, we'll see ridiculousness within one year.  God help America!|`|2AJmAD0Xaa	I hope so but you will never know|`|1AdzD6bmaa	I think deep down she will be relieved because even SHE knows she isn't ready for the job.  |`|ycDVYfvcaa	She will realize that God is Sovereign.  According to the bible God places leaders in power for his purpose.  In old testament times corrupt leaders were placed in power to provide judgment and correction on God's people. Many times the people of God were taken captive by cruel dictators. God allows the evil to be placed in power to work out His plan of discipline on His people.    Sarah Palin will understand that an Obama win means that God has turned America over to her enemies for judgment. The corruption that has taken place in the U.S. must be judged. The billions of unborn babies slaughtered must be avenged. An Obama win means that this friend of terrorists will bring terrorism upon the U.S.  Joe Biden admitted that an Obama win will bring international attack... and he is correct. Obama is a friend of terrorists. The U.S. Communist party endorses Obama.   If the enemies of the U.S. love Obama, and he becomes President..it will mean that due judgment has arrived at America.|`|AA11244976	I guess she will have to. |`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	she may say god will do the right thing in 2012. or satan did it.|`|mggll8dRaa	"Cay Sera Sera", Whatever Will Be, Will Be......!!|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	she as already (courtesy of the American public)got a diamond collar and gold (24 carrot)chain,to go with the designer lipstick for her pit bull.  .|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	She'll think he screwed up|`|iVv6bFW2aa	No, because her religion is very selective, political, and subjective. She will never accept Obama, saying that's the work of the devil. The woman is totally crazy.|`|AA11620976	No she'll say that Satan deceived America  Palin is the typical right wing crazy that believes in the  the idea of democracy but rejects the idea of democracy when in practicing it the people go against her morality   According to the RTLers 40 million abortions have legally been performed since Roe v Wade was made law>THAT is about a democratic statement about how American women actually feel about abortion as you will ever find..and yet the Palins of the America think that they know better.  |`|AA10916001	With her ego, I am sure she would actually have the audacity to question God. LOL|`|i9if59BGaa	You betcha'|`|zE9MnUZLaa	As a christian and someone that believes in God she will still turn to God to help with her fears , ESPECIALLY if BHO is elected.|`|vu3HHj9Xaa	Palin and the Reps will think Satan won or something.    That would be a Cypress Hill song..."Insane in the Membrane"
mggll8dRaa	Protection From Terrorism...!!

NOTE:  Young Voters are 'Too Naive' to figure out this Connection; maybe they should raise the Voting Age to 25...!!|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	I think the end of his term is really bringing us together. If he hadn't been so lousy, we wouldn't appreciate Obama as much. |`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	We have not been attacked since 9/11.

Next question.|`|4f3a737236a41a6d97a4242f26f42bc6aa	it was funny to watch all the old people freak out about their 401K. Lol, still gets me.|`|bqfmdwk4aa	1. Millions of liberal a holes with Bush Derangement  2.100,0000 of dead islamo facists  3. No attacks since 9-11      Hey whats not to like.|`|zpO1kKKRaa	He did a great comedic routine |`|pElG2K61aa	From stem cell research being blocked to attacking the wrong nation, I cannot remember one good thing. Clinton did go after bin Laden with cruise missles but Osama was tipped by an informant and got out 20 minutes ahead of time. Bushies just won't accept that fact, nor the fact Clinton strongly warned Bush about Osama and Bush ignored the warnings.    So no more 9/11s? How about no 9/11 at all if Bush had done his job? Clinton's intel people caught the first WTC bombers.|`|4DoXomHZaa	No more 9/11's.    The information was there when Clinton was President, he did nothing.    My taxes were half that of CLinton when Bush was in. |`|c942edca4b7daad1f360b4c708779957aa	I never voted for him, I never really supported him.  I did think he had a heartfelt reaction to being at the site of the Twin Towers, but he let all of the good will so many countries were willing to give slip through his fingers with the goals of PNAC, established before he was selected.      This man will be remembered for the great disservice he did to our country.  Thousands are dead because of his doctrine, and our country has no hope in the short term to pay off what the Iraq war has cost us.  I lost hope in getting pay back while we still toil in Afghanistan, when he said he is not concerned about where Bin Laden is.  The cornerstone of his legacy, and he doesn't care where the man who killed 3000 people is.  Bush's tenure is a sad chapter in this country's history.    |`|fmiyzqOKaa	his quotes|`|Cs7imk3Uaa	what good things?|`|9vkyyjiLaa	I think bush was the greatest president who ever lived he just was missunder stood|`|tmTTkmTeaa	Uhm, well, there was Steven Colbert's performance at the White House Correspondent's dinner...      @ Anonymous:  Sorry, but Bush did not prove 'anyone can be president'...but he DID prove that any moron with lots of money and family connections can be president, I think that's more in line with what you meant.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	As Sarah Palin would say, "you betcha."    I liked that Bush was always gracious and polite to all, even though some of them were viciously attacking him much of the time.  This was the "new tone" he tried to set that was ignored by the other side.    I liked that Bush had a great response to 9/11.  He handled the weeks and months after very well.    I like that he Bush was a straight shooter.  He didn't give great speeches, but what he told you was the truth as he knew it.    I like that he went after the terrorists every way he could.  I like that he kept us safe after 9/11.    I liked that he picked two really great Supreme Court Justices who were instrumental in preserving the 2nd Amendment recently.    I like that he handled the poor economy of 2001 and 2002 really well.    I liked my tax bill going to Zero after the Bush tax cuts of 2003.  Contrary to what many say, they benefited everyone, and millions like me didn't pay any income tax at all.  I made $45K a year. Definitely middle class.  I saw my tax bill drop from $1,200 to nothing.    I like that we had a real good economic run from 2003 thru mid 2007.    His presidency was definitely a mixed one.  There were many negatives.  We all know them and I do not dismiss them.  But there were many positives as well, and I'm glad you asked.
MH8cR5bhaa	I'm getting tired of the whole election.  Every day I get calls on the phone about the candidates. Not 1 or 2, I'm talking 50. I can't wait until its over.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Yes especially when they deal with non issues like prayer in schools, opposition to abortion, Rev Wright, Obama's birth certificate, his wife's thesis, Bill Ayers, Obama's aunt, Tony Rezko etc etc.|`|1JNL01rYaa	Yes !|`|AA10468622	I'm looking forward to Wednesday.|`|FsTLFte2aa	yes and no. there may be some people that are looking for truth.|`|MFtsL0Y3aa	yep all the time and I,m also getting tire of people trying to force me into voting for somebody I don,t want to vote for. |`|AA10378447	Yes. Especially, "Who are you voting for? McCain or Obama?" and, "Who will win? McCain or Obama?"    Ayayay!!!|`|mggll8dRaa	What a Waste of Time, Media Attention and Tax dollars for the Next 'Ineffective, Figure-Head President'.....LOL....!!|`|1774f3a59f91e35b8a32b9aabdeb174baa	yes  it seems like they don't read before they ask the same,  over n over n over|`|k6u1Kka0aa	We need more Obama or McCain questions here...NOT!
iVv6bFW2aa	You ask a very interesting and original question., Many shows are dramatizations and unreal. Those would not help a criminal. However, excellent reality based shows, or documentaries could be of help to the criminal. However censorship would be unacceptable in a Democracy.|`|mggll8dRaa	I Don't Think Most Criminals are Smart Enough to do very much about it....!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Well, it may help them to prevent themselves from being caught...if that is what you mean.|`|u23sBafTaa	I think you would have to be unbalanced to take it to that level.  Normal people just see it as entertaining, interesting.|`|zGAGZKY5aa	Yeah It dose not matter the science will nail you The criminal is too stupid to realize this|`|7e57c76aff7f3e7081be9fc8781ee45eaa	Maybe, but I know they are giving moronic jurors who watch too much TV misconceptions about what forensic investigators can actually do.  They expect there to be DNA and fingerprints on everything, and for it to be solved immediately, that's just not the way it is.|`|ntdhO8wsaa	Of course.  But its almost impossible to beat forensic science these days.|`|2fcfad55502ac06d4c0b54db7447b18aaa	no not really, besides most crimes that are committed aren't that sophisticated to begin with. How many times have you heard a prisoner say if only I had remembered to do that!|`|83334d0d7e697d6b24c2172168996034aa	Unbelievable, isn't it?  What do you do about it?  How do you stop entertainment from happening?|`|bb2c6db52d268375a8f75ea7c3169389aa	This is a very interesting question actually.    Something I have thought about as well.    Since we are exposed to complex and detailed crimes and how they are performed, it almost seems like the shows promote that behavior since it is now a concept a person can understand.    On the other hand, our law enforcement people are the best and they know what to do. They have the resources and drive to keep the public safe.    SO if people want to play a cat and mouse game, it's a risk I don't want to take.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	From criminals is probably where the people who write the forensic crime shows get their ideas from.    nfd?|`|M2UWOTAjaa	This question was already investigated in the media, and the result was that some criminals are more careful now.  Most criminals have below average intelligence. In addition most criminals assume they will never be caught, and in addition to that most crimes of assault and murder are crimes of passion. These shows give the general public the false impression that every police department in the country has a forensics lab as advanced and well staffed as that on CSI, but the truth is far from this. Massachussetts itself has a huge backlog of cases.|`|5JqCObDSaa	I think so, there are alot of things on TV that people soak in and act out in real life. I often think, "O great give criminals more ideas...just what they need".  Alot of things even children see on TV are repeated wether it be in words or action.|`|CW8ah4Wgaa	Yes. TV should be banned.|`|VKEWzxdIaa	perhaps they do show what not to do, it does provide criminals with details on how other criminals get caught
iVv6bFW2aa	Despite the financial melt down I think the world is getting better, because hopefully Obama will bring peace, and his election shows that the US is less racist.|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	Progressively worse.|`|Lelr1AQfaa	Unfortunately, worse, and way worse at that. |`|bkU23c1Kaa	better and that is in evidence.  In 1515 theft was punishable by mass lynchings.  I also think that despite the terrible behavior of the gays towards the Mormons if this issue had come up 50-100 years ago there would be blood in the streets.   Women can vote almost the world over. Slavery an instution of society since writing was invented is nearly completely wiped out. Overall the world is gradually getting better.  I am excited for the future.  |`|LKwcZ34Kaa	I would say yes, the rise of religious wars, large cities overrun with terror gangs, the rise of communism, socialism in american countries, Venezuela, u.s.a., canada , mexico ETC.  People are stocking up on canned goods and ammo, they know whats in store for them.|`|fBEi8CTlaa	Get ready, because I have a feeling we are in for a wild ride. It's getting worse by the min.|`|Ac3UkTXYaa	Worse.|`|AA11758263	I don't see any improvement, but we continue living by hope.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	It's hard to answer the question, as it is a subjective question.  Since 1800 many things have dramatically improved the lifespan and health of the general population. Modern medicine, sanitation, city planning, and technical developments like the telephone (in my opinion one of the most key inventions ever), the telegraph, railroads, airplanes and so on have made connecting with people all over the globe a whole lot easier, instantaneous even through IM services. Materials science is making large leaps forwards and within 10 years everything we have will be lighter and stronger and much more energy efficient. We face an enormous challenge in global warming, but people have never had to face such a huge problem before.Even so it seems that there are many approaches to the solution which may very well work.  Having enough clean water for people has a relatively expensive solution - the desalinization of seawater is about double the cost of ordinary tap water. This is a cost developed countries can easily afford. In a country as huge as hours, water is very expensive to ship long distances, except by ship.  It's the crazies who worry me. By these I mean the usual suspects: fundamentalist and evangelical Christians, fundamentalist Jews and fundamentalist Muslims.  Any one of these loony groups would probably be willing to set off  WWIII.|`|1jwctN8Eaa	it seems to be getting a lot worse.|`|mggll8dRaa	A Great Part of it is Definitely 'Deteriorating' in Morals & Values...!!|`|MH8cR5bhaa	Oh my !  Worse.|`|CpTQagJOaa	worse|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	What's the objective criteria?  The world is not all the same, for one thing.      Here in the US, I think it's getting worse.  My criteria is our young people and children.  They are miserable and probably the wealthiest ever.|`|wVik8Fo7aa	Due to the subversion of the U.S. Constitution and undermining the Rule of Law for the last 8 years, this country is no longer a beacon of freedom.  Unfortunately, the never-ending wars and the economic debacle have made the world less secure and conditions much worse.
OK7dtsRqaa	Yes April I am afraid they would actually use it. Remember that the USA did in World War 2.|`|pfVVSIihaa	Nuclear weapons are being used in Iraq...if you inclide depleted uranium...it is as deadly as any other Nukes...just slower...and therefore even less humane.    In fact Americans need to own the fact that WE are the only nation ever to use atomic weapons against human beings. Twice. Hiroshima and Nagasaki.    And if anything were going to teach humankind a lesson about nukes it would have been the devastation wrought upon these two cities..cities filled with women, children and octogenarian men. And the sixty years of research into radiation and its effects on the residents and their descendents.    The other issue is of course that the former USSR had many nukes which were poorly documented and which found themselves in the possession of smaller, post soviet states. A number of these have "disappeared" since the fall of the iron curtain. Into whose hands it is hard to say. Whether or not they are still viable is hard to say. whether or not they have fallen into terrorist or criminal hands is a little easier to imagine. There are probably not too many schools and hospitals out there with nukes hidden in the storeroom.    Oh...and of course there is Israel. Nuclear capable, ruthless and quite determined that if  they feel they are under real threat of invasion and conquest...they would nuke the eff out of the region...and damn the consequences to the rest of the world. They truly believe that unless te Jews possess Israel, there is no reason for the world to go on.|`|mggll8dRaa	Eventually, it will happen, 'Accidental', or Not.......!!    The Population will be 'Thinned' out, not Necessarily a Bad Thing for Human Survival...!!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Yes. That was already done by the United States last World War II in Nagasaki and Hiroshima, Japan.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	When we consider that people are willing to blow themselves up in a crowded marketplace for what they believe, I'd assume the answer is yes.|`|LDBvgEG0aa	It's only a matter of time.  This is like asking if someone like Hitler or Vlad the Impaler could possibly ever have existed.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	We dropped two nukes on Japan killing thousands so that we could prevent the death of tens of thousands.    It very dangerous and foolish to depend on nukes, yet because they do exist, we have little choice.    We were very lucky last century because the enemies we had then, were just as afraid of death as we were. But, our enemies today relish in the thought of killing themselves and even their own family for the sake of killing us too.   |`|iVv6bFW2aa	The US atom bombed Hiroshima, but I don't think any country would repeat it, except if the leaders were crazy|`|M1u3IhFFaa	  It's already happened.|`|EIFX90WRaa	In my opinion it prevents your country from getting a first strike.  Its worked well in several countries.  I think the only thing stopping us from hitting northern Pakistan full force is their nukes.|`|AA10841859	the U.S. did twice. and their does not seem to be a shortage of people willing to commit atrocities in the world.|`|AK4Iw118aa	Yes. The problem is that even if the country as a whole would know better, their crazy leader could at the very least mislead them into doing it even if he didn't have full power to do so himself.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Yes. That's what makes their proliferation so scary. The world needs to disarm, and the US needs to provide the moral leadership in this effort.|`|9040548b1acdf9513846a8ef10ae1febaa	if a person suffering from psychosis becomes head of a country who has nukes may use them without taking into consideration, the repercussions of his act.|`|QkpNt5mvaa	A straight reply would be 'no, not now, not in the given circumstances.'    There are only nine such countries in the world.     Being Nuclear is all about show-of-strength and a shield against massive aggression.    The mere existence of Pakistan is for it's Military Nuclear Capabilities alone. Next in-line is her Professional Military, else they would have been run down by US & NATO military forces, for sure.
AF0crtCRaa	If you mean drastically as implementing changes that effect all then yes.  Personally, I don't think it will be a drastic change, our economy hasn't changed since the depression.  Yes, it has its ups and downs, but basically stays the same.  Obama will put in place many of the same tactics and strategies used by the Clinton administration, which was a very good time for the American economy.  The fact is things need to change, and change for the better.  Without this we will fall behind, and other nations like Japan will own the market.  Big American corporation, need to take a deep look at their practices and eliminate the greed of the CEOs.  Remember the pres. has limited power to invoke change, it all lies in Congress and the people.  If we do not help, and do not recieve help and incintive then no, no change will occur.|`|R0mZqqfXaa	He has no power over the economy. All he can do is try and improve things.|`|q7gliZkkaa	Yes. Nobody will need to go to work. The government will pay all your bills. Fried chicken dinners will float thru the window and land on your table. We will all stand around and sing love songs. And hug trees and take rides on unicorns.....all will be peachy kean.|`|mggll8dRaa	Hopefully, He'll Appoint Capable People...!!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Not drastically. Just some mild reforms like FDR did. The establishment wouldn't allow him|`|i6RypfNIaa	unless he manages to change our economic system, the answer is no.    The president has little to no control over the economy (that doesnt stop people from blaming bush, when its more likely to be congresses fault).    If the economy improves or worsens it is on congress.|`|LK3GOgS5aa	Even dictators can not do that, I just read about how Pres Roosevelt's  advisers commented how they have 'spent and spent' and to no avail,    Although welfare could bring us down,

I can see one of his mistakes now as President-elect before he becomes a officially President to which Obama says he doesn't know his friends that well, whose his friends are well known to be anti government sentiments as his friends said Obama is a family friend to them as it emerges out now on the after election interviews.|`|AA10818613	He already made it.

There are not very many female surgeons in that male dominated country, so I asked her had she ever seen a case of osteomyelitis. Never heard from her again. More recently a female Colonel in the US Army in Iraq wrote to me. The photo was of a pretty redhead, but she refused to send me a photo of herself in uniform, which I regarded as highly suspicious.

Maintenant, imaginez au lieu d'un "Chinois" une autre origine et vous aurez une des raisons des problmes d'identit d'une partie de notre jeunesse bien fran?aise mais que des parents obtus s'obstinent  appeler : (par exemple, et sans racisme) Algrien, malien ou autres.|`|203b138561ac619bf406e8b07158e2e0aa	C'est a eux que tu dois poser la question|`|705fb5b23f11ba013a76775f705ddfb1aa	C'est surtout  eux de le dire tu ne crois pas ? s'ils se considrent encore comme Asiatiques libre  eux, pareil s'ils se considrent comme fran?ais, personnellement je n'ai pas  prendre position l dessus.

Je suis...quelqu'un qui a un vcu dj important    De toute fa?on, baisser un taux d'interet n'est pas FORCEMENT mauvais a long terme, attendez les critiques de gens comptents, et nous verrons ce qu'en pense la gauche, pour peu qu'elle pense toujours.

La collecte du produit d'pargne permet  la Caisse des dp?ts de redistribuer cette manne sous forme de prt pour le financement du logement social. Depuis plusieurs annes, le co?t du prt standard n'a cess de baisser. Avec la baisse du taux de rmunration du livret, cette baisse va tre amplifie. Eneffet,  le co?t du prt accord aux organismes sociaux est index au taux du livret A. Pour exemple, la baisse d'un point de ce taux leur permettrait une conomie de 900 millions d'euros.    Ben dis donc tu m'accuse de ne pas discuter, tu est gonfl quand mme, enfin ce n'est que Q/R on vas pas en faire une salade, tient pour finir regarde l'info ci dessus...et oui faut aussi regarder toutes les facettes d'une info pas seulement l'annonce brut...|`|DuV8xmSbaa	A l'UMP, c'est  celui qui sera le plus con !

1MnVnzauaa	Trs bonne question.    Quand je vois qu'on targue les gens de "jaloux", je m'offusque.    Il est bien dit : "on laisse 1 milliard" : c'est trop peu ?  Je crois halluciner.

D'ailleurs, faisons une diffrence entre richesse d'une entreprise et richesse de leurs dirigeants. S'il s'avre qu'elle est proportionnelle cel ne me drangerait pas totalement, mais force de constater qu'on trouve toujours de l'argent (mme quand l'entreprise est dficitaire) pour BIEN payer les revenus des dirigeants, alors qu'on a du mal  accepter un malheureux smic mme si l'entreprise est bnificiaire.    Dsol, j'arrive toujours pas  comprendre pourquoi il est logique de laisser mourir de faim des millions de personnes, tout en dnigrant les personnes qui s'en offusquent.

AA12252260	I agree with you, JD. Lives are supposedly at stake.     What irks me is when people are "la te dah" about getting out of the way...    Oh, and think of this too: At the hospital, n one level, doctors and nurses are rushing around to save the life of, for example, a premature infant. Yet on the level below them, doctors and nurses are aborting other infants. How messed up is that?!|`|HQZsotL7aa	Wow, great perspective!    I completely agree =)|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Your analogy fails.|`|gSwobfujaa	i do not agree. i do not think the 2 things relate enough. i see where u r going with this...but it isnt the same. keep in mind i do not believe in abortion...if i get pregnant-i will not be selfish and abort the baby. but some people have the right to be selfish and do so. a person who has already come out of the womb, breathed outside air and functioned in daily life---that person is alive. that person needs assistance. sorry..but its the truth.|`|dfa0f10d091f9f82c584408f50df66a8aa	Hmmm never thought about it that way... you're right that it is a form of indoctrination to lose your value for human life.

cKfycmkTaa	I did know that, and I'm glad someone brought that up.     Also, did you notice how someone answered: "No real Christian would ever do anything like that"    That's funny because it's those same people who think ALL Muslims are terrorists, when in fact, "No real Muslim would ever do anything like that"    Sometimes it's the least informed who have the strongest opinions of others.|`|Aorij1Ptaa	Yep, I knew.  I'm not saying that all religious zealots are crazy, there just seems to be lots of them.|`|4HxktSX5aa	yeah i didn't but how many knew God really was glorified by both the letter K and number 1.  meaning K is a cross-section of Gods body(ie the head appears to be missing but as the other cross-section shows ie the 1, Gods head is just bowed like in prayer or something.    so yes according the the Roman Jew Paul all things glorify lord god.  thus even K and 1 are glorified descriptions of god.    K read btwn the lines spell out (close to) liT (the T is slanted)  thus they said god is Light because liT can be pronounced the same way.  The letter T read top to bot spells out liT also thus the description of God as light(pronounced liT)  The times new roman font L has a small - on top of it so TiL is within the tnr font L ie the description of God as light(LiT).    did your hitler know that?  but as you can see i have a way of being like God or glorified in  K, T, tnr font L also.  Thus making them glorify Me.    i can stand like the K turned sidways and bow my head so that the letter K and number 1 are both cross-sections of my body.  i bear on my body a IIII I which could be described as a Till like in a field.  Thus T read top to bot is Till llll l  thus glorifying Me.  unlike Hitler the ONE glorifies Me because read btwn the lines it reads:    .n u IV I = _ (roughly)  where IV=IIII obviously.    and thus    CHRISTIAN cut into peices reads:  C H RIST I A IV /.  which makes if H equal Me.  and to us  God=g+o+d=7+15+4=26=z  that equation is the reason they said God is the beginning and the end.  because obviously Alpha and Omega is beginning and end.  where A=Alpha.  so   Z=end=God  however  z=26=2+6=H  so perhaps better is the statement  God is the Alpha(A), the H, and the Z.  or  The Beginning, somewhere in btwn, and the End.  and   both  A and Z can be seen as a description of Me because  A=Z=a mixed up .seventeen sealed together  thus  mix up a .seventeen and somewhere seal it together  so seal together two e's so they form a fancy S.  then unmix up you get  Stevens.n  ie the closest letter a . looks like is o.  thus my family name revealed.  but since all things to glofiry lord god then,  b and Y (next to A and Z), must glorifiy Me also, if i am god.  well look on that IIII I and its covered over with ink into a DI and  b= a DI (sealed together)  Y read bot to top is I IV (=I IIII the rist turned over)  Thus  Ab....YZ glorify Me, and not Hitler.  but to glorify Hitler read btwn the lines  H-it-ler  cut a small i off the r then its  H-it-leri  pronounce the i like an e like in dio.  then note  GOTT=G+o+t+t=7+15+20+20=62=6+2=8=H  so know you found out i Am a name pronounced leri stevenson and bear the scars that make me one darn god imitator of the alpha-bet.  B read top to bot is D U which is a description of My rist at times.  and seeing how the dons control your NYC streets wasn't Hitler really a pawn of the dons?|`|qjMP3EiGaa	What a person says they are and what they truly are can be two different things.  Obviously, Hitler was NOT a Christian.    Are you trying to make it sound like people who call themselves Christian are actually evil?  PULEEZE!  If Adolf Hitler had known the Bible, he would've known that whatever voice he was hearing was definitely NOT God's!  God will never contradict His word.    Killing the unborn for convenience sake (only 1% of abortions are performed because of rape and/or incest) is wrong.    Sodomy is a perversion.  You try to make it sound like Christians are off on this just because Hitler recognized those things as sins.    Nice try.  Sneaky, but it was a good try.  No sale!|`|73kknl3Qaa	the people most surprised probably won't reply|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	No he wasn't, he has a lot of striking resemblances to Barack Obama but of course you would know that if you read up on him.  |`|QskM0Mfsaa	he was also trying to create the end time as described in the bible . |`|WxqeMSw7aa	Adolf Hitler was not a Christian, he had occultist tendencies.  He may have quoted "god" etc, etc but this does NOT make him a Christian.  You are just another anti-Christian trying to stir up religious animosity on Y/A.  How many Christians do you find inciting hatred towards non- believers on this site ?    |`|XmJZkFuMaa	How about the fact that he also was one of the strongest supporters for abortion... for the RIGHT groups.  For instance, Jews, blacks, mixed-races, the handicapped, the retarded, etc.  It was against the law to abort a GERMAN baby, not anyone else.  You know.  Sort of how Planned Parenthood and abortions are made more accessible to the more ethnic neighborhoods.  He, in fact, encouraged and even forced abortions on groups that he felt should not reproduce, and it was one of the crimes against humanity he was brought up on.  But if they tested you and felt there was a variability that you might bring for a baby that had superior Aryan qualities, then you weren't allowed an abortion.  It was very much government controlled.    So yeah, I knew he made anti and pro-abortion laws.  :)    As for him being a Christian... yeah... look at the time-period and find me any European leader who was not Christian.  Sort of like saying "Hey, all the leaders in WWII were men, so it must be the fault of men!"  The point holds very little merit when you recognize that it was the norm.  We know he dabbled in the occult, and that he was extremely superstitious and did everything he could to... weigh the odds in his favor.  He read and quoted Nostradamus, and other prophesies that he felt supported his cause.  These things lean to the belief that he was Christian/Catholic as far as his public/political face, but actual beliefs weren't very confined to that religion.    And yeah, he had major anti-homosexual laws.  This was because he wanted to encourage the repopulation of the Aryan race.  Another part of this was because of the very lax-laws that were right before he took power, sort of a backlash that happened.  Another part is how people think he may have been homosexual himself, and it was sort of a hate thing (he showed greatest hatred towards the Jews, other races, and homosexuals.  People theorize he had Jewish ancestry and was homosexual... I'm not sure about some of these theories.)  Other than the SS though, who if they were found in a homosexual situation would be turned over to the concentration camp and shot, the other homosexuals taken in imprisonment were usually released, especially near the end of the war when they needed every able-bodied fighting man.  The purpose of gays being arrested never appeared to be a plot to exterminate them, but more to reeducate them.  It doesn't make it RIGHT, or anything, but they were more in the class of mentally difficient, not exactly as bad as political enemies of the government, or needing extermination (like Jews and mixed races.)    In the book "Growing up Black in Nazi Germany" the author speaks about a friend caught playing with himself and how he was given the order to go to a prostitute and get straightened out.  This was seen as a 'cure' back then, and for first time offenders, I'm under the impression that's what was often used.    I'm not sure why your question wasn't put in history rather than in elections since it was more talking about history like you said, and not about current political agendas and happenings.|`|9XAqnmOQaa	I knew it.|`|808da1ba51e8fd80415df1fc03dcf21aaa	I am thinking that Hitler was not a christian at all.|`|K7H1zrCbaa	just because he claimed to be a christian, doesnt mean he was.  no real christian would do the things he did.|`|VUgCSQ6Daa	You are delusional. Although there have been many religious zealots that were also insane, attributing an insane man's actions to a religious belief is a bit much , don't you think? Jim Jones is a modern example, just not on the scale of seducing a nation, the circumstances after WWI led to the outcome and cultism of the Nazi's. Couple the Nazi's rise to power with a leader who was crazy and willing to murder millions and there you have Hitler.|`|fh12fkNWaa	Yes, I did know that.

God says, "Beware of those who come in My name". Whats so difficult about that to understand? Hitler was not a Christian by any sense of the word. God is love and light and truth. Does any of that compare to Hitler? Just because a pig puts on a dress and walks on its hind legs doesn't make it anything else but a pig. Hitler could call himself anything he liked. It didnt mean that he actually *was*. And he only went to a Christian church a couple of times to impress Eva Braun. (Funny though how Obama ent to a Christian church. That tricky little devil satan...he's always trying to undermine Christianity).    Not meant to relate to todays politics?

Wake the **** up or HELLO China.|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	I wrote a large paper on Hitler's youth in college.  Actually, he only gave Christianity lip service - to forward his political ambitions.  There was nothing Christian about his philosophy, and in fact many many Christians who hid Jews, and many Christian clergy, were sent to and died in the concentration camps.  In short, Hitler was about as Christian as Obama is.  |`|MMwnFj1oaa	You have things quite backwards as regards Catholicism and Nazism - Pius XII did not "support" Hitler (you'll want to look at the work of academic historians who've had access to the most recently available documents, not anti-religious apologists). It's rather complicated, and Pius XII was as unaccustomed to dealing with this sort of politics as anyone else in Europe at that time, but he was not "in cahoots" with Hitler (just look how the Nazis interpreted his "Christmas broadcast" in 1942, or his efforts which saved thousands and thousands of lives). And . . . it was, in fact, the predominantly *Protestant* precincts in Germany that overwhelmingly voted to elect Hitler, *not* the predominantly Catholic ones. (And, as we all know, Catholic laypeople, priests and nuns were among the many who were murdered by the Nazis - just think of Fr Rupert Mayer in Munich or Fr Maximillian Kolbe in Poland.)    But you're right, the Nazis were (in addition to being virulently anti-Catholic) anti-homosexual and anti-abortion (unless you were Jewish).|`|2099dad9b345a0bec745abdcbc7f2a21aa	he may have been a far right wing whacko, but he was no Christian.    he and his admin were into some pretty freaky and wild stuff.|`|drkbm5G5aa	hitler and the nazi administration also held many superstitious beliefs about the occult.   as to your case for him being anti abortion.... i know that the nazis advocated the killing of children born with defects.|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Right wing?|`|OAjmheWiaa	hhm, never heard that..|`|FBGiDvp6aa	It's a good thing Mein Cain & pope Palin didn't win|`|681cdc7b4046a0a5541c9e3d94132feaaa	Hitler was also born Jewish |`|rpJYlkNVaa	Stalin that commie f**k killed more of his own people then Hitler did.|`|ORLHsxUwaa	yeah he was, but come on, no one associates right-wing christians with hitler. his ideology had nothing to do with his religion, he just used it to justify his actions.    that said, they are often way too exclusive and fail to see the boundary between church and state. |`|zfFjKhJJaa	Lol    Hitler was a maniac regardless of religion.

auJiPMAmaa	Here's why...    December 8, 1993    NAFTA signed into law  The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is signed into law by President Bill Clinton. Clinton said he hoped the agreement would encourage other nations to work toward a broader world-trade pact.    |`|aLwrpMPXaa	Because it was him that did this damage by signing that bill without considering for one single moment, the consequences of his stupid actions or administration:    The 1 million jobs displaced by NAFTA trade, primarily in manufacturing, would have paid $800 per week or more in 2004. The average job in the rest of the economy paid only $683 per week, 16% to 19% less than trade-related jobs. Growing trade deficits with Mexico and Canada have pushed more than 1 million workers out of higher-wage jobs and into lower-wage positions in non-trade related industries. Thus, the displacement of 1 million jobs from traded to non-traded goods industries reduced wage payments to U.S. workers by $7.6 billion in 2004 alone.  NAFTA alone is responsible for the loss of at least 1,000,000 good paying U.S. jobs, mostly in manufacturing while at the same time wages continue to be driven down.|`|qByPrCMqaa	he passed it and were saying it beacuse everyone blames it on the republicans soly when it was like you said a bipartisan effort|`|df1c5b7ceeb67e1e343a9e7f5f5a9139aa	I have an old aquaintance who is like the Democrat Party members.

If you're wondering about the bailout, and what's going on, I read something that Ayn Rand wrote about depressions, check this out:    "There is nothing in the nature of a free-market economy to cause [a depression]..."  It happens because the government believes that they can "keep the economy in a state of unending boom."  book: Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal by Ayn Rand p. 79-80.    Really the gov't is just getting in the way of natural progress.  If they could they would have tried to keep us from reaching the moon by saving the jobs of coal-shovelers on steam engines to avoid progressing to jet engines.  Get it.  Its interesting.    Anyway, Ayn Rand's books are amazing.  She talks a lot about that stuff.

ujxh8Pb2aa	It's been the union-busting American way for a while. Ship services out of the US to other countries that have no OSHA or safety regs, get substandard crap back to pass on to the American consumer. Of course you don't lower prices when you save money by paying 2 dollars an hour, you just exploit workers in other countries.   And the companies and execs get richer, and more greedy. And the American worker, American consumer, American economy and exploited workers all pay for higher profit margins.  Outsourcing American jobs has helped run our country into the ground. If we have no jobs here, who fuels the economy?|`|JlkWt3Evaa	NO!!!  Absolutely not. I don't think the auto industry should be bailed out.   |`|diZoW49Zaa	Fukem, they shouldn't be.

LTS3GCpQaa	 Well this is a much better way to ask the same question I have tried to        I fell for the appeal to the lowest common denominator      The bankers got 700 billion --- for what ?     Bad assets - what does that translate into ?     Mortgages people defaulted on - they were loaned money could not pay it back and lost their house - Homeless      The insurance industry underwrites banks - they had so many claims from banks that they could no longer handle it      The 700 billion was to rescue the insurance underwriters and the banks who made poor decisions --- or on the other side of the coin      Forced people into such dire straights - that they went broke - the terms were never ever re-negotiated as part of this bail out - No no      The loans --- were paid back to the bank to get them off insurance companies books -      Where did they get this money from ?     It was created out of thin air - "fiat" They pumped into the economy the entire military budget for one year -      The US outspends the number 2 nation on a ratio of 10 to 1 on the military budget - which makes up 15 % of the estimated "bad assets"     ------------------------     Are the corporations - the bankers and the insurance underwriters to the victim as we have been told ?      Or did we just get conned into a criminals explanation that in fact the victim was to blame for it all ?    -----------------------     Auto workers CEO's to get 85 billion - ( but they need a plan the bankers are unsupervised ) they showed up in private jets and the media was waiting for them - pictures of why we should hate them abounded in the media      Morons bought it - the set up to blame the victim again has begun     --------------------------------------...     10 Times the money and 1/10 the hassle -for bankers - who all showed up on a public bus for their check careful to keep the transfer in their pocket - thus no media coverage of them ????     ______________     The Auto industry drives the economy we were all told since the mid 60's --- well they no longer tell us that do they ?     The jobs that are going to be lost --- will result in a new round of bad assets and a jr accountant could see it coming a mile away      No job - no income - not going to make the  payments this month honey ---     Not even a school child would miss that one - but our leaders have apparently "missed" this      ---------------     The bankers are about to be "victimized" again aren't they ?     Or are they going to retain the house and hold on to it and sell it back to someone some day ?     Guess what - 15% was a small figure - and cost one year of military budget - it came off the back of the tax payer and it is about to happen again      The media has set the stage --- do you hate the lazy opulence of the Auto industry yet ? Good then you aren't looking at that fat cat banker      --------------------------------     Print enough of this stuff called money and you will get hyperinflation      -  |`|ovSkTNCoaa	Where do you draw the line in bailing businesses out?

The UAW has socked it to the auto makers by sucking them dry of operating cash for decades. They have to pay 5 billion a month for healtcare and pensions. What do you think? That's money not actually going to run the friggin business.    Hell yeah the economy having turned the way it did, its not going to be good for anyone's business, including your mortgage payment.    They need to go into bankruptcy, sheer off the unions, thin out the fat and chop off the dead limbs.|`|8jKzMOboaa	The big three can not compete with the foreign car market built in the states by Americans.There are many reasons but the two I give you spells out most of it.Number 1 it costs 30 to 40% more because unions have their own agenda. And for every one employed by the big three pay for two no longer working.We no longer need the U.S car makers.They will never be able to compete.So the car industry will not go out of business just the names change.Just remember the big three lost the game with go old fashion competition.Greed just dose not work in the long run.That why corporations have the ability to go  chapter 11. That the only way for them to make it.They must start over and not with tax money.That just would not be fare to all the other bossiness. That is not what  government is for.Just think free enterprise.Henry Ford made a product for the masses.G.M. stayed in the suv market for one reason, double the money. There's the answew greed again.|`|AA10222223	Mostly, but not entirely false.    Certainly big companies can make big mistakes that bring their own downfall (the auto industry comes to mind).  But when a person is running a big company, these are people who have already succeeded & proven themsleves to be able to make wise business decisions.      But the average American citizen includes those who are inexperineced, have had bad advise, or have other problems (addiction, low IQ,  mental problems, etc.) that contribute to their bad decisions, which contribute to their failure.    I have spoken many times about my brother.  He is one of the many unemployed.  And I promise you, it is his own fault for being irresponsible & lazy.  He would never get a chance to run some big company, but if he did, he would run it into the ground in a heart beat.|`|2FA9qNHzaa	Let's see. American greed should be given any sort of pass? The UAW deserves no pity in my book, when others get paid minimum wage, live poorly, and never have health insurance, let alone for the rest of their lives.

What is the problem except GREED?|`|AA11702773	YEah.      I don't think its the unions fault, I think it is much more complex.    But I don't think other people should add bailing out failing companies to their own economic woes.|`|LROaxvV8aa	True.There is a desperate need to rethink how business is done in this country.I'm of the mind that the Unions helped put themselves out of jobs,along with the CEOs,and are just as guilty. |`|AA11119758	I can only speak for myself-I blame both equally for lack of foresight and greed.  It's true, though, that big business seems to get a free pass, while individuals simply learn a painful lesson.
AA11209831	Unions served a good and useful purpose in the past.    Today they do more harm to their members and the industries than good.    If you join a union, you are basically paying someone to tell you when not to work.  I remember a few years ago when some union in California had their people strike because the grocery store baggers were going to be charged a 15 dollar copay on their health insurance.  Insane.  I would kill to have a 15 dollar copay.    It's idiocy like that that has turned people away from the unions.  That and the fact that many times unions have priced themselves out of jobs by demanding wages that were so high the owner(s) of companies have closed down the factories because it was cheaper.    *EDIT*  Japan does not outsource to the United States because of labor cost's.  They open auto factories here because of the tariffs.  Also, go to a Honda or Toyota plant, not a single union worker in the bunch.  I know because I deliver to them all the time.|`|2dqQQg41aa	These days there are good and bad in unions.    I am a union member right now and have been a member of 3 unions for the 30+ years I've been working.    The bad is that unions can protect bad employees to the point that they cannot get rid of them.  The good is that many companies (IE: CEO's) are corrupt and treat employees very badly if they can save a nickel.  Just look at the hundreds of companies that are currently having major financial problems right now.  No reasonable person can blame those issues anywhere but on the corporate heads MOST OF ALL!  Yes I know there are other reasons but executives are a different breed - they serve on each others boards and thus give each other raises & GOLDEN PARACHUTES that no other employee gets.  If a CEO can take home 500 times what a regular employee makes then that company needs a union to take that CEO down a notch.|`|AA11702773	It's a mess.    I'm against the auto company bailout and think they should renegotiate in chapter 11 but that isn't because I wish the unions badly, I just don't think I should have to pay for their benefits or the company's mismanagement except at the time I buy a car.|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes.    I don't understand why an acceptable action for US companies to go abroad with no recourse from the government.  (But then again Cheney did move Halliburton to Dubai).      Somehow much of the working class has been fooled to side with the elite 1% in the name of the working class.    And the UAW was not the reason behind the failure of the US auto industry.  I would blame poor decision making on the part of the high level management.|`|AA10691226	Yes. I'm firmly in favor of unions yet I don't want to bail out the auto industry.That a company is unionized doesn't mean it gets to be an evergreen.|`|TiUkZEUiaa	unions is number the greater the number the stronger the power. and power is like riding a horse if you can't  steer or handle them then correctly as it supposed to be i guess sorry your day is numbered|`|U2qRvH2laa	Yes, and much of what you say is true. I watched a woman on cspan the other day take calls in regards to global economy. She couldn't make the connection of lower standard of living here as a result of some of the economical changes due to this globalization. She continued to beat a dead horse. I think it's reasonable for Americans to expect a decent wage. I don't agree however that unions are the sole answer and maybe not the answer.Unions demand something from someone who hired the workers to help make his/her business successful. If employees are not happy with a particular employer, they need to move on. They offer schooling today for disgruntled and misplaced workers at the drop of the hat. Anyone could find success if they truly work for it. This country is still the greatest opportunity.  I use to belong to two different unions and had no hard feelings toward them, until recently when they lobbied our state government to force property owners to have intrusive inspections when building your own home. We can't do our own plumbing now and we are on a slippery slope. Soon the property owner won't be able do build his/her own home. I don't like it.  American made products are some of the best and we could self sustain I think by making sure our living standard here comes first in these trade deals and if it means a certain amount of isolationism then so be it. This giant sucking sound Ross Perot warned of 16 years ago has come to pass.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	have you heard about the crisis in the auto industry?    it is 100% the fault of unions    Unions are for people too weak to speak for themselves    " thats just propaganda"    No it isnt    They overpaid people for the job they did. Just look at California grocery stores where a person with no skills can make 20 dollars an hour for scanning groceries.|`|BVyJ9HBRaa	How many union jobs went away because of greedy union thugs|`|9cpKYneZaa	Yes. And rightfully so. I remember back in the 70's, they kept building COLA's into their contracts anticipating upward inflation, which fed inflation. It was a spiral that so wrecked the economy that it contributed to the tremendous inflation of the late 70's. Its what drove Chrysler nearly into bankruptcy early on.    These days, you can use your bargaining power to negotiate health and safety standards. Its called voting. Congress has passed more laws for health, safety and labor standards than ever could've been dreamed of by the union organizers a hundred years ago.|`|oNg8zGi8aa	The labor force in this country is pegged for servitude by the Globalist .

Beside the higher wage you get, just goes to the union.  Sorry, I used to be a member of a union, it's definitely better to be rewarded for your accomplishments, rather than a strong-arming union steward.|`|EqhLQ61Jaa	Check out this leaked info guys you need to here this its dire!|`|WDVyEpRNaa	what do you need a union for these days?     safety?   no    pay?   no not rly..wages are prety high...  and less because of the economy..  any undue pressure from the union would likey just cause lay-offs  and that is exactly what is happening.    in some cases you might want a union...but for most you dont.     also they take money out of your paycheck..  and you have little to no input into how the union operates. 
bqJgdcfLaa	I personally think that nobody should be allowed to fail if they are important enough.  Every individual is too important to be allowed to fail, thus, we have welfare, medicaid, and social security.  But we also have some institutions that employ too many people to be allowed to fail.  You call the auto companies monopolies; there are three, and then the foreign companies.  The American manufacturers are just too important to too many people to be allowed to go under.  GM would not survive bankruptcy.  Bankruptcy requires credit.  The credit market isn't large enough currently to hold up GM, much less, the all three.    I think your intuition about things not being fair is right.  But as I said, individuals should be helped as well.  Two wrongs doesn't make a right.  When individuals do badly it is most often not their fault.  When companies do, it may more likely be, but they just affect too many people.|`|rUNlmQG5aa	Yes, but unfortunately the worker's fate is directly tied to the companies- and everyone knows this. It may be morally difficult to determine whether feeding the workers one meal or giving the corporations a great big fishing net is the right thing to do, so to speak. It comes down to practicality. Bail them out if that's what it takes but insist on severe government controls like no more two ton SUV's in a diminishing oil scenario and development of alternative energy vehicles, once and for all and stop supporting the oil agenda.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	You have a point.  The standard has to be the same.  We have a thin safety net for people not doing well:  welfare, medicaid, unemployment benefits.  It isn't enough to live well on, but it gets you through the hard times provided you are willing to work when your situation improves.  The Big 3 have to be held to the same standards.  Yes, we can loan them money, but they have to restructure through a formal Chapter 11, their execs have to go.  First in line to receive anything that can be salvaged are the company's customers and retirees, since they have nowhere else to go.  Funds have to be set aside to pay for warranties and retirement benefits promised to those who fulfilled their side of the bargain by buying the cars and working a lifetime.  Next in line are the employees, who can't all stay, and can't keep the benefits and salaries that receive now.  Last are the creditors and shareholders.  They get nothing.  Without something that drastic, any bailout money will be simply enabling the company executives to keep doing the things that brought us to where we are now.

That is the only way we can be secure.    No matter what stipulation we make to other countries, we will never be able to control them.  We need to become self-reliable. That creates jobs and a decent standard of living.    The collapse of our system is because of all of the outsourcing which  was strictly to increase the income of a select few.

You restrict Freedom  and  Homeland Security.      |`|d6bb91335d2d467b86fe9b280c4c812eaa	Getting people to work is more important and saving our economy. However I do feel the same way about China.

Massive spending does not fix a problem caused by massive spending. Bailing people out by increasing loans is a large part of how our economic predicament was started, and he's only throwing fuel on the fire. He's also sending 40,000 troops to Afghanistan. He tried so hard to make people believe that he was the candidate for peace, but that's not accurate at all. If we stopped spending billions of dollars on our over-seas empire-building in the middle east, we could focus better on our problems at home. Mr. Obama won a lot of people during the campaign by telling people what they wanted to hear, and now he's doing whatever he wants instead of whatever he promised.|`|34e8246abf1aad02b8dc83cb73086294aa	i don't think he is the devil but he is a socialist with socialist ideals<br>  and that's enough for me

eluInD1Aaa	Yes, Rep's said about two years ago, that they face of their party of being destroyed because of their graft from 2001-2006 and because of the failed policies of Bush's White House.  Now with Allen Greenspan saying yesterday that the Rep's ideology on economics has failed, Rep's are now asking for people to be scare of Dem's.      We need to be scare of someone is what Rep's have counted on for over sixty years.  I just hope the American people don't fall for it again.|`|AA12182751	No, they are trying to save us. The Democrats are already making plans to kill us.    They want to reinstate the fairness act, giving them the ability to tell tv and radio what they have to show.    They are talking now about taking our 401k programs, making them government run, and putting them into social security, then when you die, they are subject to the 50% death tax, and as Senator Kennedy has said, the death tax only hurts the poor, since the rich have the ability to get around it.    They are talking about the Employees Right of Choice Act, which would force small business's to become union.    So you tell me, if the Dems win and do what they are talking about NOW, how is that any good for us?

IbJ2O0vpaa	This is in the legal category, and I can't address the law knowledgeably.    But in principle, yes, it's quite simple to imagine a free press that has minor constraints like preventing publication of something that would endanger national security. E.g., during the Cold War it would have been bad to allow publication of the location of every missile in the U.S.    We have more freedom of speech in the U.S. than in other western nations, but we still have the legal caveat that this does not extend to yelling "fire!" in a crowded theater or to slander.  I think to have similar boundaries on a free press is not unreasonable. To me, the problem of large corporations controlling our media and feeding us news-pablum is a much larger problem than anything constitutional.    The problem comes in when government claims matters of national security are involved when it's not true, like Nixon trying to keep the Pentagon Papers from being published.  Other than Nixon and Bush, I am not aware, in my lifetime, of other presidents abusing their power similarly, and neither has been successful in the long term.    I do tend to gloss over our differences as administrative; a parliament vs. our unique legislative bodies.  I don't like some of the differences - I'd'd greatly prefer if we didn't have the 2nd amendment, which is surely antiquated - but do feel they have a minor effect on the extent of our freedoms in the two nations.|`|RcCJSSMPaa	No, I don't see freedom of the press except in a very few independent publications.  It's more like "freedom of the press according to Rupert Murdoch."    And neoimperialism in the US is loosely disguised as "capitalist democracy."    Great post!|`|YIqUugOyaa	Wow, your question just kinda stemmed out into a little rant there. I am gonna try to stay on point with the answer, though. Censorship is to protect the public, or at least in the gov. eyes. What it really protects is the right to view and/or hear any media that may be classified as a secret file, or info. These things would make it to the papers, and to the telebroadcasts if it weren't  for the censorships. Much like any other program, it is mostly designed to throw that preverbial wrench into the plans of real Americans which is the pursuit of what we know is rightfully ours.....The freedom to do whatever the hell we want. (but it'll never happen)|`|kJM65nXJaa	I don,t know if this is what you are looking for, but the Patriot Act jumps out to me, It would fall into the personal freedom part of your question. The government can wiretap you without a warrant, and search your home without obtaining a warrant. With the technology of today, and the governments ability to track into key words being spoken or written, and then act upon that info with the afore mentioned act, infringes on our freedom of speech. Just my rambling thoughts on a snow day.

It's AIPAC that calls the shots in the Middle East.|`|33ppbrMJaa	I believe that Israel is playing into the hands of those who do not want a peace strategy between them and the Palestinians.  Obviously, some group...perhaps Hamas, or some rogue members of a terrorist group...are trying to incite violence, causing Israel to react.  This is exactly what happened in Lebanon and it is happening now in Gaza.    I can't place blame on Israel for reacting to missile attacks, because it can't be easy to be unable to go to a restaurant and a market without worrying about explosive attacks.  But I believe the Peace Talks should have gone forward and I think, if the terms had been agreeable to both sides, perhaps the Palestinian government themselves would have helped crack down on these senseless missile attacks.    I do know that, if we are wise, we should build up a state of Palestine, giving it equal status with Israel, recognizing its government, treating it as a country.  The hatred of Israel has grown in proportion to the help we have given it to succeed, while the Palestinians remain poverty stricken and resentful.    I don't know how it helps to kill and maim civilians. They are powerless to do anything about these actions.  We, as Americans, should understand that. For years now, we have fought a war in Iraq that we know was presented with falsehoods, yet we remained at war for several years and still are there, even though a majority of our people wanted to end it.    There has to be some way to halt this slaughter. Surely the combined forces of Palestine government and Israeli government could figure out some way for peace.

The stories of them being homemade small rockets aren't true - many have been Chinese Rad missiles which can carry bio or chemical warheads (but haven't).  Additionally, the weapons were being stored in private homes. If you want to stop the weapons being launched, how would you do that?    Withholding medical supplies doesn't seem right - but in order to stop the flow of rockets and launchers every truck, every ship has to be inspected.    I do think their is an ulterior motive - and that is to 'inspire' the Palestinians to get rid of Hamas as the governing authority of Gaza.    But overall, what the press is not saying is that the medical supplies are delayed to search for the weapons - which is a legitimate thing to do.

AA11284831	Typical scare-mongering.  The sad thing is that they're fooling folks like old "Joe the Plumber" who would benefit much MORE under Obama's tax plan then he ever will under McCain's.    The fools that call the tax refunds to the working poor welfare, such as the Earned Income Credit, forget that this is a  REPUBLICAN program.  It was implemented under Reagan and was expanded massively by both Bushes.    Of course, they also ignore that giving larger tax cuts to the wealthy than the middle class and poor is Welfare for the Rich.

To call giving them more of some one else money anything short of Socialism is laughable. Obama says he will give a tax cut to 95% of Americans, yet 40% pay nothing.  When he says tax cut he mans after Bush's tax cuts expire in 2010, then he will lower taxes to a standard ABOVE what it is now. In other words, your everyone will see taxes go up, then a few will se them go up less than they are now and that will be a tax cut. Makes perfect sense!    You question is flawed.

I think, instead, that they are over-informed.  The problem is that their information is coming from Rush, Sean, Laura, Bill O, Michael Weiner, Glenn Beck, Marc Levin, Fox News, Ann Coulter, NewsMax, WorldNetDaily and the hundreds of other millionaires and well-funded institutions out there that act as if debate consists of hurling slogans and regurgitating accusations.  The wealthy pay a tax to these word artists to keep millions of listeners and readers misinformed because that tax is much lower than, say, a 3% marginal income tax increase.      And don't be fooled, the world these folks create is a comfortable one.  A person who listens faithfully believes that he or she is fully informed, is, in fact, at the vanguard of those who would protect our freedoms and privileges.  They believe they are part of a cause to keep the weak from overwhelming the strong and productive.    If these people were uninformed, you could provide them with facts and appeal to them with reason.  Unfortunately, the media world they inhabit inoculates them against such things as facts and reason.    It is quite sad, actually.|`|OPrvUEDYaa	The progressive income tax is unfair, petty, and punishes productivity.     Can we get "real" for a moment? For the most part, the wealthy are better than you or I. Most wealthy folks worked hard to get there and made the hard decisions we don't want to make. Giving a tax cut to someone who doesn't pay taxes and who uses a lot of public resources is welfare.    Taking from the "wealthy" and giving to the poor is a form of Socialism which eventually leads to a stagnant economy and crushing of creativity.    The only tax that is even remotely fair is a flat tax - of say, 12 per cent.    If you don't like being poor, acquire the skills necessary to become rich.    Thank God for the rich. They buy the expensive first versions of products and enable us to buy the later cheaper versions. Thank God for the wealthy.     Government programs often foster dependency and benefit government employees most of all.    Liberals don't seem to understand that "good intentions" are not enough. The plan has to work.    Is that too realistic or "harsh'?    No one owes anyone else anything. If you want to be happy, be happy. If you want to be wealthy, acquire the skills. The wealthy don't need to give back. Usually they are wealthy because they have given a lot to society.     They are more valuable than the rest of us -  like it or not.    Self-pity, envy, and jealousy are very unattractive traits.    If you keep taxing the productive, they will leave. Then what do the dependent people do?    The wealthy owe you nothing.|`|xFbJt6usaa	No, they like tax cuts for all.  The poor don't pay taxes, some want to give them back more than they pay in credits.|`|d16afef07fb16c1347799fdb08a91484aa	The lowest fifty percent of the American people do not pay any income taxes. how can you cut someone's taxes when they're not paying any?   Perhaps what you're calling a tax cut really is a welfare payment.    If you really want to know why raising taxes on the rich is such a bad idea, let me remind you that most of the investment in new jobs comes from this group.  Each time you increase the taxes that these people pay you are not taking money out of their living expenses or recreation, you are actually taxing away money that would have gone into investment.    Socialism is dangerous because it saps our economy and impoverishes the very people you claim to want to help.|`|MsDGKa7gaa	because the rich gets richer the poor gets poorer the world is sick  bite ya lip and live and die|`|JzqIHVTiaa	typical answer from a Republican like "Answer Man" above me.

The repeal of the Bush Tax custs is a tax increase..comprende...moron.|`|jJsazq5Saa	Now listen, John McCain only wants to give the tax cuts to the big companies for one reason and one reason only. If they have to pay less taxes, then their prices for their products will go down, making it easier for us. So in the end, it's helpful for us. And republicans do NOT call tax cuts for middle class welfare, I don't know where you're getting this crap.|`|XGb8zHbhaa	Simple Republicans are hypocrites.     However you also have to understand their mindset.    In their mind anybody who makes less than 250,000 dollars a year pays no taxes so they think its just a handout.    Also they believe heavily in trickle down economics for big Business (which failed under Hoover during the Depression by they way). This is another stupid argument because most small businesses make under 250,000 dollars a year and they hire more people overall.             |`|MEReSvZeaa	Just another liberal liar.    Bush cut taxes for the poor and middle class more than the rich, but your brain is jello and you allow the media to tell you differently.    Take it from me, a tax accountant.  When the Bush Tax Cuts expire in 2010, every family in America will at a minimum pay $600 per child MORE in taxes.    If Obama is not fighting to make these cuts permenant, he will raise your taxes by doing nothing.|`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	It's called socialism for big business, and capitalism for everybody else.

uKaj1kHfaa	I think Bill Richardson would be a good choice, but it's clear from all the sources close to the action who have reported that Clinton will get the offer. I think she'd be good since a SOS needs to have some force. She just needs to back up Obama's policies and remember to be diplomatic. I worry about her getting too warhungry because of some of the statements she made during the primary, though I think some of that was to show that she could be strong with foreign policy as a woman.

Therefore they maintained their independence and were not as heavily affected.|`|lU5mdniUaa	they are not part of the new world order like the rest of us who have been sleeping at the wheel. we got the biggest eye opening surprise with all this and we better get a hold of it or we going to be lower than them soon.|`|PIhwSSRxaa	The economy of Venezuela rides on oil:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_...

AA12341057	Those things were all still there under communism too, they were just killed on sight instead of jailed. It wasn't the capitalism, it was the switch to a free society. With freedom comes those who will take advantage of it- but that in no way means human rights should be abandoned. |`|iVv6bFW2aa	This is because Russia just like the United States has turned into a dog eat dog , capitalist society in which the strongest whether criminal or not are able to survive and wreak damage, In societies like Cuba and Venezuela people identify with each other and do not commit as many crimes. It should be noted that the US, because of some of their punitive drug laws, has the highest percentage of persons in prison in the entire world. These persons are mainly minorities who do not have adequate resources to defend themselves|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	The correlation is between quality of life & crime. The better off people are, the less need there is for crime.

Crime in the US, as compared to Europe, is more of a result of a less homegenous and broad population.     Cities with high crime often have had years if not decades of left-wing mayors and lots of government aid and programs.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	The answer is no. Crime exists in all societies regardless of political structure. Apparently you never heard of the black market which thrived in the Soviet Union. In short the crime was always there. The illusion that it didn't exist was a product of a very closed society which had tight controls coupled with extremely severe punishments.|`|4nD0NJReaa	Yes, there probably is, Capitalism brings out the worst in people.|`|mvVhbY1Gaa	No, Their is a correlation between a liberal Capitalist society and crime. Liberalism leads to moral decline. That's a fact. Look at all your major metros here in the USA . Everyone of them are liberally slanted and everyone has high crime. |`|F3DDgXVKaa	Well,........:    When you have socialism, there is no stratification of resources going on. No one is super happy, but at the same time no one is worried about where their next meal is going to come from etc. Capitalism changes that, and the U.S. is a perfect example: You have the top 1% making more that 10 times more than everyone else; while there are some individuals who have to turn to crime or deal with the very real possibility of starvation, etc. All crime is , is a coping mechanism; usually those who engage in it, do so as a means of survival|`|4EkE8eebaa	Basically capitalism makes people equal, so there doesn't need to be any of those stuff that you listed because they would pretty much have no motive!
iVv6bFW2aa	No, because tit's almost impossible to wipe out Al Queda, and the US is hated because of their troops and because they are hurting innocent Afghans with their bombs.

America represented a chance to make yourself over, come to a new land and create a new life.    It was an opportunity to be able to speak your mind, to practice your religion without fear of recrimination or pogroms. If you wanted to escape, America was the place to go. But above all, they came for the freedom that they knew they would never have in their home countries.    And we have successfully taken those people in, given them the opportunities, added many elements of their cultures in the creation of a uniquely American culture.     There will probably never be another country like America and we have all benefited because of it.|`|de0fc1da097f66a349eb15de28f1834faa	It should be called Land of opportunities as long as you don't make $250,000.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Here I can do anything.

Americans have become like spoiled children, and when things are not going the way they think they deserve, they get pissy and turn out for elections!    I would not say they intentionally voted for socialism at all (for one thing, many of the people who voted for Obama do not know what socialism even is.)  Rather, I would say America voted for who they thought the best candidate was, and the ones who won have now signed us all up for something that is going to be the closest thing this country has ever seen to socialism.

6kUx7fwcaa	No.  Calling Obama a socialist was political tripe.  These political terms have little meaning to a large majority of the American public.  People saw it as a pejorative term that raises people's ire, but they really don't know what it would mean in pragmatic term, except it has to do with spreading the wealth from the haves to the have-nots.

I felt it was usual, yet pathetic, and expected of an uncouth terrorist supporting Iraqi journalist.   I felt no insult however. What that man did shows me, and the world with ears, and sight, that the terrorists there are angry, why? Because we are beating them, and taking back Iraq for the Iraqi citizens to live freely, to have choices, and children of both sexes allowed to go to school.     The journalist should be charged with a crime, however, since violence against a world leader is not to go unpunished.     It matters not if you agree with the war in Iraq. It matters that all elected officials are deemed with due respect. If nothing happens to this man, this so called journalist, then it shows the world, that our leaders are to be treated with violence, and hatred. Doing that will set the world into anarchy.    I don't think anyone wants that.    Are the media our leaders, or those we voted for?|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Ire.|`|xagiOb80aa	I wish only that every US citizen so inclined had a similar opportunity...

I am not a Bush supporter but I feel it was very disrespectful. The Iraqi people wanted Saddam out and wanted freedom and now all they want to do is shout "death to America" and carry out disrespectful acts. I say bring the troops home and let them sink or swim. They have been fighting for 2 thousand years and as soon as we pull out they will be back to "business as usual" And for anyone that does not feel that this was a disrespectful act can't have much patriotism. The popularity of the president does not matter it was the act that was carried out.|`|Xzs6X7sZaa	Given what has transpired over the last eight years, I would say that Bush is fortunate that it was shoes, and not bullets, being thrown at him.

Anyone could have thrown a bucket of horse dung on Nixon and the whole country would have cheered.  I have much less respect for George Bush.  Get the point?  I have quite a bit of confidence that the reporter doesn't hate Americans, just George Bush.  That seems to be the world consensus at this time and for the last 6 years.  That's why it isn't only Americans who are heaving a sigh of relief that the "Bush Doctrine" won't be carried forth by the next clueless Republican in line, it's the entire world.|`|FEu3JyXXaa	Bush is an easy target.

He should never be allowed to disrespectful toward one above the laws though such as our president.|`|6kUx7fwcaa	The act was violent, but it was not extremely violent.  The United States has a history of freedom of expression.  In some sense it sounded as if the person had some justification for his anger, i.e., his treatment at the hands of Unted States authority, but he chose to express it in an inappropriate way, although that apparently is the immature manner of protest common to his country.  Countries and cultures, as people, mature.  And to think they think of the United States as immature; in some ways it is and in some it isn't.  The US involvement in Iraq showed impulsivity and immaturity and like a child the reporter acted in the same manner.  I feel sadness for the state of humanity.  How easy it is to degenerate and how hard it is to be constructive.|`|AA12089018	I believe the moron who threw his shoes at President Bush is a moron and should be dealt with properly.

The president seemed to try to indicate that we should think it was funny.  That was HIS response.    I have a number of reactions including the one you mention, but you can not tell us what is patriotic for us to FEEL. I strongly feel that Bush himself is "an insult to the American nation".  And more than bush (because this is a supposed "democracy") I've found it more disturbing WHY a certain portion of voters voted for him to lead us.  He's not even the leader, he demoted himself years ago to just the "Decide-er". He is incompetent t lead. He has been incompetent to unite us in a sensible direction.

5TB3Q88gaa	No    I'm guessing that you are a young poster. Here is some food for thought. During your life you will come in contact with many people, in school, college, work, community, volunteer work, etc. Will you stop and ask everyone you become friendly with for their life history? And do you have the time to vet them as such. Ask yourself, now that we have gotten to know Sarah Palin and her husband Todd, just exactly how much time did John McCain vet them? We found out that Todd belonged to a secessionist group, who's founder said some really hateful things about America.     It's the real world and unless we live alone in a cave, this story just doesn't have any legs. Besides, it just serves to remind us of a bad time in America's history when people were protesting the Vietnam War and National Guards shot four students at Kent State for doing so. It's time to drop this story.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	In the first place, Obama, was not palling or pailing around with terrorists.

Secondly, this is just one more smear, because the Mc SAME-Paylin ticket has no better issues to raise, so that they have no choice but to engage in  McCarthyism red baiting as if  the voters were fools. This issue never came up in the debates, because neither the moderators nor the public asked questions about it. They were concerned with. issues of much greater importance such as  ending the War on Iraq, the meltdown of the economy, taxes, and health care. Lastly SDS, when active, did it's best to avoid hurting people as a result of their activities, but sometimes unfortunate accidents did happen. In  those cases persons found guilty were punished. SDS pursued a noble cause, although some of their tactics might be questioned. Ayers  to this day has dedicated himself to helping those in need. I would be proud to have him as a friend or pal, whatever the case maybe.McSAME and Paylin are in no position to talk about terrorism, because she and her husband were involved, with the terrorist Alaska Independence Part, which advocated armed revolution to separate Alaska from the US.

5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	They have been.  Chinese officials are visiting Cuba this week.  They've been supporting the government there and Raul Casto has asked for additional assistance so they're going to see what the real need is.   The Chinese have begun oil exploration and production off the coast - almost where WE could be drilling if it weren't for the Democrats blocking it so they're supporting Cuba until that big money comes in.    Venezuela has been hurting for a long time.    Hugo Chavez nationalized a lot of their industries and their productivity has dropped dramatically.  After he nationalized the oil companies, the US companies pulled out and Venezuela lost the markets for their heavy crude.  There are few refineries that can use it so their revenues are down.  Chavez cut off his own nose to spite his face.  He raised taxes on business and the rich and gave more to the poor and working classes so income dropped to the government which is hurting.  Sound familiar?  Chavez continues to spend huge amounts on defense to rebuild his antiquated military and is buying arms from Russia, China, and Iran so he has a balance of payments problem.  He's also assisting Ecuador, Boliva, and rebels in Colombia. which he doesn't need to be doing but spreading Marxism is a priority for him.    Latin America is going to be a major challenge for the US in the near future.|`|ulzWumWPaa	When you're in a country that's on the bottom of the social-economic scale, there's little effect from the world's economic distress.

I recall Venezuela having a really hard time about a year ago when there was literally no food in the stores to even buy! The people were outraged and protests took place. This was also about the time that Chavez wanted to become "ruler for life"; but his people said, "Hell no!"    But, trust me, he'll find a way to get around it. They a-l-w-a-y-s do!    Cuba, is poor and will stay poor. Nothing from nothing leaves-nothing!  |`|EMPVIFmLaa	Cuba is already toast.  Until recently, Venezuela has been awash in oil revenues, but now is getting a harsh wake-up call.|`|AA12365543	They are.  Cuba is getting less tourists and relies on subsidized petrol from Venezuela.    Venezuela is suffering heavy inflation since Chavez keeps giving away resources to its allies for free or subsidized, and thousands of jobs have been lost in tourism, oil and mining sector due to nationalization of the resources and majority of the tourists formerly comming from USA and Europe.|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because they were able to maintain their independence from the US imposed systems of capitalism, neo liberalism, and colonialism.

Last but not least, like Cuba, most of thier people are so poor having a little less money has little to no effect on them.      Last but not lease, your supposition that they aer not effected by the global crisis is wrong.  they are being effected.  Most of their people are poor enough, like sub saharran Africa, that they either do not know or do not caree that the wealthier nations are losing some of thier wealth.  nor do they care that the wealthier people in hteir nations are losing their moeny.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	They will eventually, Venezuela at least. Cuba's economy is mostly domestic. Foreign commerce is restricted from the inside or from the outside (embargo). They have no financial system (they have but is very small), most people trade in cash or just plain merchandise exchange.    The crisis is mostly a credit crisis, it affects countries, corporations and people that depends on credit to live.    Other countries are suffering because the governments live on foreign credit but the people couldn't care less because they have no credit at all. Countries with huge "social programs" (subsidizing potato couchs basically) are in trouble now because the governments are running out of money to spend and there's nobody to go for more. Eventually they'll strangle the local commerce a little more to get more funding but they'll create more problems in the long run. Taking more money from the productive part of society will make some of them fall into the non productive group. Some companies surviving on the border of profitability will close, job positions will disappear. Workers will move from the formal market to the informal market to protect their income, some just to get so income at all because job positions will be hard to get. The cost of labor will sky rocket and nobody will invest in productive enterprises.  
EHtFxGxMaa	Fact is the wheels were set in motion by Jimmy Carter in 1977.    Then expanded upon by the Clinton administration.    Carter was instrumental in pushing the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 that started the pressure on banks to grant risky loans to unqualified people which was later accelerated by Bill Clinton in 1995.    Then the laws were changed during the Clinton administration to allow banks to invest in the stock market. That was something that was outlawed in the 1920's because of the depression.|`|ZTbgOgqgaa	I don't know, but since President Bush wants to take credit for it...    ...I say, "Let him!":    "...     The President set a goal to increase the number of minority homeowners by 5.5 million families by the end of the decade. Through his homeownership challenge, the President called on the private sector to help in this effort. More than two dozen companies and organizations have made commitments to increase minority homeownership - including pledges to provide more than $1.1 trillion in mortgage purchases for minority homebuyers this decade.      President Bush signed the $200 million-per-year American Dream Downpayment Act which will help approximately 40,000 families each year with their downpayment and closing costs.      The Administration proposed the Zero-Downpayment Initiative to allow the Federal Housing Administration to insure mortgages for first-time homebuyers without a downpayment. Projections indicate this could generate over 150,000 new homeowners in the first year alone.   ..."|`|qwetlHs2aa	Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae giving MILLIONS to democrats including Obama|`|wze0FnOQaa	I'll tell you who's to blame for our financial crisis....WALL STREET!I say this because all of the people who work on wall street are all super fu* ing greedy!And it was their bad business practices,and making loans to people with bad credit,or,who really couldn't afford to buy a mortgage,what caused this financial problem.And now that it's blown up in their faces,all of them start pissing and moaning,and saying all this stupid ****...when it's THEIR FAULT all this happened in the first place!!And if you notice,not all the banks around are in danger of closing,do you notice this and wonder why?I'll tell you WHY not every bank is in danger of bankruptcy...ONLY the banks that DIDN"T lower their loaning standards,just so they could make billions,are the ones that'll not be in a financial crisis.But,all those banks who sold "bundled packages"of mortgages to people with really bad credit,or even NO CREDIT at all,they're the ones now who're feeling the pinch.So if anyone is to blame,spread the word,it's all wall streets fault.And anyone who tells you differently,or says it's not wall streets fault,well..they obviously support corporate greed at it's worst,so don't listen to anything they say.Wall Street fucked it up for everyone,and now they're trying to **** everyone some more by getting tax payers to bail them out from THIER BAD DECISIONS!But think of it like this..if ou were a regular business,and you invested all you have on a few stocks,and you lost everything you invested because the stockbroker who sold you the crappy stocks told you it was a "smart investment".Now,if you went to the government and told them what had happened,do you really think they would bail you out?Or even reimburse you your money?HA...you know they wouldn't.All these governmental perks we hear about are only for rich people.But why should they get all the perks?How about some perks for the tax payer,who's constantly footing the bill for the governments bullshit!?|`|AA10719402	This video is spam.

You've got a few problems in it though.    Number one, never trust a political ad with dance music and block type.    More seriously, the CRA only applied to about half of home loans.  The riskier loans were supplied by lenders like countrywide that weren't under CRA regulation.    The real problem is that republican legislation allowed mortgages to be traded like stocks.  This caused the loans that were no longer balanced by savings which allowed the banks to fail when homeowners defaulted.    Two more points, didn't the republican party have control during part of this mess?  I also suggest you read the rest of the wiki on the CRA that your video for some reason omitted, read the part about what Mr. Bush wanted to do in '03.  We're all lucky that didn't make it through.    Nice try, you'll get a lot of uneducated people upset.

AA11209831	Not everybody that makes over 250,000 is a celebrity, there are many of us that have combined incomes that total over 250,000 dollars.  I am an owner operator truck driver, and my girlfriend is a RN, if we were to get married we would make a combined total of over 300,000.  Thanks to Mr. Obama and his proposed tax plan we are now putting off our marriage to see who wins the election.  And, if it is Mr. Obama we will be spending a LOT of time with tax attorneys and accountants before we get married.    |`|jKLIKDJ3aa	Many Americans are still kidding themselves that they will ever make that much ... and I honestly have no answer for you, I don't know why they would vote against a policy that so clearly helps them.|`|SlWjhHJnaa	The taxes are passed on to consumers. rich Hollywood can afford to pay extra. Most of the Hollywood actors film out of the country to avoid paying income tax so they could care less how much it goes up. (when is the last time you seen a movie filmed in the US, not many anymore.)|`|MNo82BWnaa	There is a big difference between 250,000 and millions of dollars so that is why celebrities don't care about tax hikes, it doesn't affect them as much   Secondly , read this online.wsj.com/article/SB122488938501868...    this explains it is not 250,00 but rather 164,000.  Even if that sounds like a high wage, don't people want to aspire to that? Why anyone other than the truly needy (children, disabled etc) would think this is good is strange to me.    Think about it: people who make more money spend more, therefore there is more employment, more charitable donations.  If you start taxing people, they cut back and guess who losses out in the end - the middle class because the people making these high wages, if they are smart, have already saved money and if they lose a job can live a couple of years without pay - not so for everyone else.    And raising taxes on big companies isn't good because they will just lay people off - it's already happening.    Read the tax plans and then you can  decide what is good for you -
FbFApbFDaa	Did Bush steal an election in 2000? Go back and read all the news reports. The democrats pushed every LEGAL button to force so many recounts. The Recounts of county after county added votes to Al Gore. He received the benefit of those counts and still was found to be short of votes in Florida and Ohio.    As to Obama - The election can't come fast enough! He doesn't want all his connections with ACORN revealed.

fp3ZUgP3aa	Liam is right.  Nobody finds out for themselves anymore.  The more "information" you try to obtain these days the more you are brainwashed.  It is extremely difficult to get unbiased information and the skewing of and/or ignoring information that is counter to your point has become systematic.    Look at politics right now.  If your on the right the right is right and always has been.  If your on the left the left is right and always has been.  And NOBODY is willing to recognize that these two things cannot simultaneously exist.    |`|kY0EMbfEaa	Free-thinking is freedom of thought. Everyone in this country has freedom of thought. That is one thing that they cannot take from us.  Unfortunately, we are only given two real choices. From those, we must choose what best matches our own thinking. However, it is our duty, as voters, to research each position, and decide for ourselves which one we most agree with.|`|0Ei3ePJzaa	People consider themselves to be freethinkers because they believe that they formed an opinion completely out of the blue.    What they need to realise is that they wouldn't be able to form an opinion on a matter if they were not told about it, and depending on who told them or where they got the information from they will have got the information from a certain viewpoint, just to influence that "freethinking" opinion further.    Mind you, you could argue that some historical figures have been free thinking, as they created a different opinion or way of life (such as Henry with his COE religion) and then set about saying "I'm King and if you don't agree with me I'll murder you" just so he could sleep with other women.  That's style, if not free thinking.    |`|lEaT5q06aa	in general i agree completely;    the closest that you can get is to examine each belief,     and for reason, reject each, or part of each    what a person believes is trash, all kinds of people believe all kinds of nonsense, and their belief is as good as mine    what someone has decided not to believe and why they decided to not believe it is of potential importance    there is rarely a thought that is relatively free, but we can free ourselves of thoughtless belief|`|WmgqUYnjaa	Wrong my friend...but good try!    Chris I|`|Y8rB9iuHaa	We agree Your Fabulousness. |`|yuBuNoPDaa	Because they are stupid? That seems like the obvious answer.   They don't know any better.     That's certainly true. There is a lot that we don't know. What we do know is pretty insignificant. I tend to think of freethinking as more aligned with independent thought. It could be the people are using the wrong words.     What you say reminds me of what someone said with regards to non-conformists. They say they don't want to conform but they do conform because they all kind of look a like in how they dress and present themselves. (goth, punk)      Free-thought: What does that even mean? You think freely? I don't think so. |`|bmCInR5qaa	Liam has spoken.  An anarchist is born.|`|mkCjcG5oaa	Woo hoo I'm a fool!  But wait, I just followed your lead!!!! Oh NOOOOOO!!!    Seriously though, it's not hard to disseminate information for yourself.  It just requires that you do not take information as fact when you see it.  You have to research it yourself.|`|702967588509dc786e63d6d41ebcdb8eaa	Okay then. Whilst it's a fair point that many who call themselves free thinkers are such because they aren't aware of or understand all the issues. However to declare that no one can be informed enough to be able to come to their own conclusion on political issues is so mind blowingly ignorant and arrogant I can hardly believe it.  I'd guess you're quite young and feel as though you understand the world but you've proven your ignorance by expressing your opinion using such absolute language.  Firstly, lighten up. Secondly, "the key to true knowledge is to know that we know nothing"...|`|f6Qad0usaa	I strongly disagree.    It is as Jiddu Krishnamurti said; "Take what is useful and discard the rest."    I can hardly see that my beliefs are accurately represented by any political party or movement.  Some may be closer than others but fundamental disagreements may be found among them all.     Casting your lot is not necessarily following.  The freethinker should always assume a footing that will position him to bite the hand that feeds him if need be.    I can think of many who follow no leader at all.|`|2d63894d5d03bc3e3ec3921e71eba0d7aa	They declare that because they're stupid people.

Obama is young and offers a NEW concept.  HE is intelligent, well taught, and no one cares about Muslims.    McCain is getting old and he flew off the handle too many times and that showed that he was too explosive and would not be able to handle the stress of the President.      For once, NO ONE cared that Obama was backed by the Mob in Chicago or that he may have obtained his Harvard Degree with their help. What makes the man, is NOT The man himself.  People are a combination of ALL the influences in their lives.    The more I found out about McCain the more worried I became.  The more I found out Obama the more I admired him.  I admire intelligence.  McCain made some stupid moves in his life and he was NOT smart enough to make sure that they stayed buried or he did not explain them adequately to cover himself if people found them out.    Joe the Plumber had nothing to do with the election, nor did Ayers or that minister.  It was all about the job and who could do it best.   I would have preferred Chuck Baldwin but I don't know if he could have done all that Obama is going to have to do once he gets going.  Obama is going to have to hit the field running b/c the Russians are not going to wait for him to catch up, nor will the economy wait as well.      The important thing is that we have the right guy.  The problem is that BOTH Obama and McCain are CFR members and THAT will be the determining factor in the long run.  McCain would have gone by the book with the CFR b/c McCain was bought by the conservative right.  Obama MIGHT be his own man, like Kennedy, and he might end up like Kennedy too, but I have faith the Obama is smart enough to learn by Kennedy's mistakes and NOT make them.  And I'm hoping that Obama will sit down with the CFR and work things out with them, in advance.    Peace, Love, Light!  I AM   Dartagnon 
A3UftwH9aa	Despite what rabid archconservatives and bigoted Christers will claim, Obama could perhaps, possibly be the most Israel-friendly president in modern history, probably even moreso than Clinton or Reagan.  If his selection of unapologetic Zionist Joe Biden as his running mate wasn't an early indicator of who's side he's on regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, I don't know what would have been.  One would think it's just an election year ploy to appease the AIPAC lobby and maintain the predominately Democratic Jewish vote.

Do you actually believe the US is ready to forgive and forget after just seven years.  That slimy degenerate bin Laden is at it again, threatening yet another attack on the US, and you want the citizens to say all is forgiven.    Even if Obama wanted to do nice with the Arab world, he wouldn't be on the same page with most Americans, so if he wants to unite the US he will need to sacrifice a few friendships to do so.
87c3528d810e2e8b0beab012774ff5a8aa	A mi francamente so s me llama mucho la atencin. Comprendo y critico que desde un punto de vista geoestratgico el imperialismo econmico defienda determinados intereses que le favorecen en el Oriente Medio, como ocurri con el petroleo en Irak y el comercio de opio y cocaina en Afghanistan. As ocurre tambin con los intereses de Israel como estado tapn o contencin de esos mismos intereses.    Pero esto solo es comprensible desde el punto de vista de la izquierda autntica  socialista,  marxista o transformadora. O desde una concepcin libertaria.    Lo que me extra?a es que los que hablan de moderacin, centrismo, socialdemocracia o liberalismo y no justificacin de los medios por los fines, al menos a nivel de coartada ideolgica; sientan "unnimemente" la necesidad de justificar al estado de Israel haga lo que haga. Deberan por lo menos aparentar cierta objetividad y no-alineacin en un conflicto tnico-religioso.    ? Se trata de miedo o de mala conciencia ?    Tambin me llama la atencin la "necesidad" infantil que sienten los foristas de la derecha liberal de atribuirnos a la izquierda barabaridades como que somos anti-judos ( antisemitas por extensin impropia ) o defendemos a los terrroristas teocrticos de HAMAS.Al punto que todo dialogo resulta imposible, eres tal y eres cual, NO importa lo que afirmes. No escuchan.    ? En que se basan y donde estan las pruebas y ejemplos de alguien que no siendo nazi, defienda esas posiciones en este foro ?

Histricamente, los partidos de la derecha tradicional no se han caracterizado por recurrir a la movilizacin de masas como herramienta de promocin de sus plataformas. La movilizacin de masas pertenece, en la prctica -descontando el caso especial del fascismo- a la tradicin progresista, socialista, de izquierda, etc. La movilizacin de protesta siempre fue una herramienta de los que luchan contra el statu quo, no de quienes lo administran.  Esto resulta, por supuesto, de otros motivos. La poltica de los partidos  aglutinados a la derecha es una poltica de cuadros, de comunicadores, de control de la movilizacin.

Michael Dukakis completely blew it in the 1988 campaign season when in September he decided it would be a good idea to get photographed driving around in a tank with a helmet on looking like a dork and allowed the Bush campaign to successfully make the case that he would be an unfit commander in chief of the military.  He also further blew it when he said during the October 13 Presidential debate that if his wife was raped and murdered, he would not support the death penalty for his wife's killer.    Despite leading in many polls before the October 13 debate, his performance that night saw his numbers sharply drop and Dukakis went on to lose the election in a landslide, carrying only 10 states and Washington, DC.    As for Mondale, he consistently trailed in polls and was generally a weak candidate.  The race between Kerry and Bush was consistently close and went back and forth, but it would be unfair to say he lost major ground in the weeks leading up to the election.

P8GqzLveaa	first of all it depends on your nationality and then your husband's salary, as some of the Kuwaiti rules if the man have a salary of 250KD he can bring his wife and kids to stay with him.    if your husband passed the rule above he can send you the visa and for sure u must leave KSA could be to Bahrain or UAE so when you are there you must go to the Kuwaiti embassy in that country and they will guide you through it and how to do it    good luck

It gives credence and air time to people who support terrorism, even who supported 9-11. Not just the man in this newspaper article, but the people who danced in teh street when they heard about 9-11   Norwegian Doctor in Gaza Supported 9/11 Attacks  Middle East | Tue, Jan 6, 2009 at 3:58:57 pm PST    Mads Gilbert, a Norwegian doctor in Gaza, is all over the mainstream media, claiming that Israel is indiscriminately and purposely murdering civilians. Hes given interviews to the BBC, CBS, NBC, CNN, ABC, the Independent, Sky News, and the New York Times, among others.    And in 2001, shortly after the 9/11 terror attacks, this supposedly impartial Norwegian doctor (actually a radical Marxist member of Norways Red party) expressed support for the hijackers.    In an interview with the Norwegian daily, Dagbladet, shortly after the attacks, Gilbert stated:    The attack on New York was not surprising, after the policy that has led the West in recent decades. I am upset over the terrorist attack, but am equally upset over the suffering which the United States has created. It is in this context that the 5000 dead people must be seen. If the U.S. government has a legitimate right to bomb and kill civilians in Iraq, then there is also a moral right to attack the United States with the weapons they had to create. Dead civilians are the same whether they are Americans, Palestinians or Iraqis.    When asked by Dagbladet if he supported the terrorist attack on the U.S., he replied:    Terror is a bad weapon, but the answer is yes, within the context I have mentioned.    Of course, not a single mainstream media report on the creep mentions any of this.
tvNkizDraa	I don't know, I can only hope that he's not going to become 'Obama the appeaser'.  I remain wary but hopeful, because it's way too soon to make any plausible predictions at this point.  I am however, VERY disappointed in his choice of Hillary as Sec of State, given the differences in their views towards negotiation in foreign policy.  Hillary does not strike me as one who will give up her personal agendas, so I see some real problems with her earnestly carrying out Obama's foreign policy.

Wow what a change (sarcasm intended). What actual changes is he trying to make? Hmm lets see, he is going to borrow our own money from a private Bankig Cartel at interest (the Federal Reserve), to try to stimulate the economy. This has been done many times alone by the Bush Administration, and guess what folks, it failed miserably, thats why we are still in a big recession moving closer to a depression, thats why we are still at war in Iraq, that has lasted almost 5 years now, thats why we have the biggest federal deficit we have ever had,Thank God for change (sarcasm intended again), now after Obama borrows all of this money from the Federal Reserve, we will have a bigger deficit, we will still be in a war, and we will continue to Bailout Industries. Wow, I am sure glad we will have a change. (MUCH MORE SARCASM INTENDED). A true CHANGE would be to abolish the Federal Reserve, allow our Treasury Department to print and distribute our money Interest Free, and have NO deficit. As far as our Foreign policy goes, mind our own damn business as it says in our own Constitution of trading with other nations and align ourselves with none, bring all of our troups home in all 140 nations threough the world, have them spend their military pay here in the states, and build our own infrastructure, by using our own Seabees or Combat Engineers who are already on the payroll. That would be true CHANGE. Wow I'm sure glad our nations policies have changed, (total sarcasm) intended.

He had MITSUBISHI buillding of their cars while he told us to buy America.    Do you remember what was in the news about the "big three" when they went to Japan with the first President Bush?|`|s9yItMt5aa	Your auto industry is in trouble because of what it produces. Honda & Toyota have never made gas guzzlers & they will never be. Your auto industry should be strictly regulated before the Government's bail out!|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Perhaps, but they all are union busters.|`|RRFbDou9aa	They already have taken over.

The big three are circling a black hole of expenses that would consume any capital or companies that would render aid.|`|lrMCiDnraa	That would make about as much sense as GM wanting to buy Dodge.  If you are profitable you don't buy a money losing business with outdated products and out of control labor costs.|`|k6u1Kka0aa	How would the jobs be safer? The Asian auto companies are non-union so the workers can be fired at any time. Are you basing the question on product? Do you know GM uses Honda engines in some vehicles?

Do you know the new VW Routan minivan is the same as a Dodge Caravan?|`|LAU0wb7kaa	Because there are still a bunch of hicks out there who will only buy Fords and Chevys.

I can tell you without hesitation or equivocation ... that Honda and Toyota don't have any secrets up their sleeves. GM and Ford as well as Chrysler, have European models that compete head to head with other manufacturers... they intentionally sold poor quality cars here forever, because Americans had the Money to cover it, ..vehicle gets to 60k you trade it, so what if it lost 80% of it's value, we'll buy another.   That menality has provided all the American manufacturers an endless supply of buyers..  we started calling them prospects in the 80's .. then they morphed into consumers sometime in the 90's.. then they became wise and we called em "difficult" because they came in with Carfax's...    take it from an insider.. this whole thing sucks *** and if they get the bailout it will be the worst EXAMPLE of corporate welfare ever... well at least since AIG|`|7cnLaQZNaa	I do not think so, Japan is in a recession.|`|AA10356921	Well, given the fact that ALABAMA will pass Michigan in 2009 for the   of automobiles produced, ALABAMA does not have union workers, and ALABAMA is home to Hyundai (and parts plants), Honda, Mercedes-Benz, soon Nissan...and ALABAMA's economy is fine, and ALABAMA has a low unemployment rate....

k6hicodfaa	Europe has more stringent MPG ratings and other environmental standards than the US.|`|AA11369432	Maybe it's about the workers....|`|iVv6bFW2aa	Because the Governments overseas require higher quality control. This is also because Bush lets the corporations get away with murder.|`|Rlvo5P9maa	Because Europe has all the good cars; Mercedes, Ferrari etc.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	Europeans in general are not so focused on the image...They just want reliability, fuel efficiency and safety or they won't buy. They have world class public transportation...it has flaws but what is in the states can't even begin to compare.    ETA...auto's in general are much more expensive in Europe so they actually pay for what they are getting. A ford focus wouldn't be bought by a US citizen for 30,ooo so they reduce the quality for the people only willing to pay 12,ooo or less .  Its stupid because the car will need to be replaced or repaired more often. Americans are stupid and the auto industry takes advantage of it.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Europeans will not buy junk.  They build a different class of auto and they have price control and support on parts. The type of worker hired in Europe has a different mind set than his American counterpart.  Europe has a very long tradition of craftsmanship that has not been weakened by greed. The unions in Europe work from different guidelines and the respective governments are more interested in quality and health of the worker than here.    I find it funny that we are focused on the big three here and most say let them go under and reform from the ashes.  No one is talking about the Japanese or European car makers here in the USA that are building a good product and making money for the company and the workers are in many ways better off than the mes in Detroit. A lot is union caused but it is also management fault. Both have allowed the what it it for me and screw you take control. They are mismanaged and bloated by their own indifference and greed.  Toyota USA,&  Honda USA don't have that problem.  They build a good product at a reasonable price in the models people like.  They have the same rules and regulations as Detroit but they care, the big three don't. They have the attitude that it is American company so we can do as we please. Let them file bankruptcy and regroup.  We will be better off than bailing them out, just to have to do it again.  Stop rewarding lousy work and greed.|`|2MfFXmNMaa	Higher quality standards in Europe.|`|LK3GOgS5aa	Made in Europe by 'clockmaker's vs made in US by 'clock watcher's"|`|lklwmGh6aa	Higher Standards.  |`|jJ7X4cEwaa	IMO, it's due to the fact that they are usually partnered with a another (local or regional) company that has a better understanding of the market needs in that specific country (GM owns, Opel, etc..).  "Better" is a tough word to quantify.  I don't think they are necessarily more reliable from a power-train standpoint, most American cars put in a lot more miles over the same time period, so it's difficult to compare.  I agree though, I have ridden in or rented quite a few cars in Europe that I would love to be able to get my hands on in the US.  I think the European cars are usually lighter, more fuel efficient, and sacrifice some creature comforts for fuel efficiency (noise levels, stiffer ride, etc..).  The question is whether or not the American market will buy these types of cars.  When fuel prices dropped in America over the last few weeks, Sport Utility Vehicle sales spiked upward again.... a sad commentary.|`|6zC7Qyxjaa	Because European Buyers are much more discriminating, also they've been paying exaggerated fuel costs for years... they won't accept a Guzzler unless they themselves are Loaded. To own an American made Cadillac Escalade for example is the Pinnacle of decadence for a German... there are a few here and there but overall, they buy economy.  Having said that.. Euro Manufacturers build better cars for other markets as well.. Range Rovers get 10mg better fuel economy in Europe... oh yea that's right Ford owns them... never mind :)|`|vh2tuGZPaa	anything Else that is bothering you ? |`|k6u1Kka0aa	Better designed as in what way? Better fuel economy? Sure, because of taxes on gasoline in Europe, gas is very expensive. It was $5 per gallon in Germany when I was there in 1999. Europe has an extensive mass transit system unlike the US, so very few people own cars. If they do, they keep them for 10 years, unlike Americans who want a new car every 3 years. If you think the quality isn't there, consumers disagree.|`|412f673354a42041faf908ccbc558571aa	You get what you pay for. GM made some very good EVs but they got shelved somewhere along the line. It would be a revolution if they were allowed to continue production. What people will do for greed and now they want a bail out.|`|mALlaYHwaa	because America has too many regulations here that Europe does not have...we have too much government in our lives!

Seriously, no failing business "deserves" a bailout and it is only being considered because of the affect the collapse may have on the economy.  Our government is shaking in their shoes because they are desperately trying to avoid a 1930's-style Great Depression.    We should be shaking, too.  We are certainly teetering on the edge. |`|1amF7oNwaa	ABSOLUTELY NO ONE.  YOU MADE THE BED SO LIE IN IT.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	I think the gov't should focus on bailing themselves out.....they are the biggest dead beats off all.      I have to add that if bailouts are done that no executive should be getting any bonuses until they payback the tax payers. Im sick of their sociopath mentality...they are entitled to nothing...the companies they're running are failing. Ask a small business owner what she gets if her company is in the red. She doesn't even get a paycheck.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	I'll be honest. An occasional bailout for any major industry is acceptable.

Now, if that does not spark the economy, I don't know what will.|`|DvMS9Jjuaa	Not the banks, they are the lest deserving, but they're getting bailed out. It's the auto manufacturers that actually produce something that needs the bailouts, but Paulson says he won't bail them out. So you have to conclude that the bailout is just for the rich elites that are just robbing us blind.|`|dHjya1Yoaa	On one hand you have the banks, that hold all of our ability to get credit from loans for anything to credit cards.... they were too greedy that they allowed whomever breathed over the age of 18 get some type of credit/loan for what ever reason without a down payment... so now they have all these assets that were foreclosed on or repoed... because they messed around with sub-prime interest rate and predatory lending       On the other hand you have auto manufacturers that won't get out of the oil companies pockets and build the car that the people want.... a highly dependable, high fuel efficient car for the masses.... and so they are losing money because instead of building innovative cars that people want they are continuing to build trucks and SUV's that only a few want.....       Both have fallen because of their own stupidity.... so neither should get a bailout because all they are going to do is squander it away on bonuses and trips and other fluff stuff and not put out goods or services that the people want/need.... I say let capitalism take its course...|`|3Z4YFz29aa	the taxpayer|`|kpa1jMG5aa	Automotive Companies.  Why?  Because they actually manufacture a product and employ many people.

4fqaQRnIaa	Absolutely not.  Bush is a mean, arrogant, stupid man who has screwed up this nation for decades so he could play master-soldier; something he was afraid to do in real life.  He is a coward and a constant liar.    But, I don't have blind faith in Obama and I'm quite sure I will disagree with some of the things he will do.  Obama probably has the toughest job as future president because of the unremitting ignorance of Bush and his horrid administration.  Even though Clinton allowed the sale of sub-prime loans Bush had ages to tell the banks "no more".  He was, after all, at the helm as the banks encouraged millions to borrow more than they could afford.  This is not a case of caveat emptor, it is a case of very, very poor bank self regulation.  After all, the bankers are the experts.  So many people look up to the expertise of the bankers and when the bankers say to Joe Smoe that he can afford this much who is Joe to contradict his superior in money matters?  So the initial fault lies with Clinton, then the bankers followed by Bush.  The borrowers are the pawns in this situation.    Anyway, back to Oboma, no I don't give him carte blanche.  We must always  be vigilant in care of our crippled democracy.|`|SIKuOevVaa	It would be... if there was as much as there was with Bush, but there isn't any.

That having been said, Obama is a lot more competent and intelligent than George Bush. So if you had to pick one to have blind faith in it would  be Obama.|`|9VL72MKzaa	Believe it or not, there were many of us who voted for Obama after analyzing his policy proposals, listening to him debate numerous times, watched him in action during the economic crisis (and McCain's inaction) and heard what people who have knowledge of his intellectual curiosity and judgment (e.g. Colin Powell) had to say about him.  So I'm not sure what you mean by blind faith.|`|ggAFbRZdaa	I don't know about you, but I have no "blind faith" in any politician, Bush, McCain, Obama...|`|AA11313983	Blind faith in anything makes it a religion.

Bush is incompetent is so many ways.  |`|XuLVfj1caa	Yes!  In the words of the infamous but beloved Ronald Reagan, "Trust, but verify..."  No one should get a blank check.  Obama should not expect to get blind cooperation.  Bush has ruined that idea.  Obama should expect and encourage responsible scrutiny of his programs and ideas.  Otherwise, we would not be doing our jobs as citizens of this great country.

Master Obama continues to remind us of his racial difference on a daily basis, to foster hate and envy between races and socio-economic classes. I believe unemployment will hit 12% long before 4 years. We are paying off debt, and cutting back We are cooking meals at home (even though I have plenty of money and can afford to eat out) I'm going to keep my money out of the banks too. I cashed in my stocks at a loss to write off the capital loss on my taxes. Most other people in the know are doing exactly the same thing. It's going to get a lot worse before it gets better. The rich will pass master Obama's tax increases on to employees, shareholders and customers. Banks are still lending money to deadbeats. We can't trust them. 6 months after they decide to once again free the tax slaves I will invest the money I have in the market and make a killing.     Liberals when they see something in the economy that is broken, ask what the government can do to "fix it". Conservatives ask what the government did to cause the problem. Of course, the "fix" is to stop abusive taxation and let the mighty engines of a free economy pull the ship out of the abyss.    There is a concept well known in physics, it applies to politics as well. Inertia, A body in motion tends to stay in motion and a body at rest tends to stay at rest unless forces are applied. If Master Obama wants change, he will have to use force. The Missing part of the Master Obama propaganda blitz is: How much force will Master Omaba use? Who will Obama force? How much force will Obama use? Will Master Obama ever stop using force? Democrats don't understand the force will be applied to themselves as well as Republicans as Master Obama and the other ultra-liberals in Congress and the Senate try to spread more and more wealth around    "Trying to tax a country out of debt is like a man standing in a bucket and trying to lift himself up by pulling on the handle" - Winston Churchill    The last president to raise taxes in a recession was Hoover. He cause the great depression. FDR made it longer and worse by continuing to tax the rich. He had the insanely evil, misguided notion, government could create jobs.     Master Obama's pie-in-the-sky story followers will follow him. He is a Democrat. He will continue to blame Bush, big oil, big pharmaceutical, rich people, He will never ever take the blame for anything that goes wrong and he will never admit to doing anything wrong. He will play the race card and get out of jail free. The ones who will abandon him will be doing it too late, after the damage is done. The party of the poor, will become more powerful as more and more poor people are created who need government help. They will continue to be deluded into thinking the rich have too much money and tax the rich. He will continue to foster division along racial lines and along economic lines. The new disenfranchised will vote democrat because the republicans will continue to want to cut back government spending and take their little piece of the pie away. Of course, the only way to fix things is to cut back spending and lower taxes. Master Obama knows full well what he's doing. He knows raising taxes will slow the economy. He knows prices will go up to cover increases in corporate taxation. He knows The rich will cut back and make employees work harder for less. He knows stock holders will earn less on investments. He is also lying when he states no one under 250,000 will be taxed more. They will be. he intends to roll back the Bush tax decreases that have saved the economy from disaster. Rolling back Bush tax decreases is a monumental tax increase on the poor and middle classes. Please understand, the poor and middle class tax slaves pay all taxes (even those levied on the rich and on corporations) as the price increases and cut backs affect them.     Of course the liberals will think Obama is the best Master in the world and cares deeply for the pains they are suffering (Pains inflicted by _______ - fill in the blank) No one will hear about anything Governor Palin has done or is thinking. Master Obama and the fairness doctrine goons will see no "good" right wing political thought or news leaks out. (our only hope of winning is to have the fairness doctrine declaired unconstitutional) The media has been suffering for a long time due to the popularity and truthfulness of right wing talk radio. The democrats seek to put a muzzle on it. The fairness doctrine will be enacted against talk radio as a "thank you" to the major channels. We will be left with continual, unrelenting left wing propaganda. They saw Hi|`|zEVpA4WCaa	 YES |`|VS0PuI5paa	Unregulated international trade started with Clinton's NAFTA bill.

What we do think is that unions have jacked up the price of doing business so high that the automakers cannot compete with foreign companies who do not have to deal with unions.  What we do think is that we have bailed out GM before and now they come begging again.  The question do we throw good money after bad.  What we do wonder about is why the management of the auto companies are being paid bonuses?  What we do wonder is why the democrats are always ready to give the auto companies another bail out.    Here is a better solution to the economic mess we are in give each and every American a $100,000 bail out.  Mortgages will be paid, cars will be bought, credit cards will be caught up and people will spend the money.  It would be a lot more effective than bailing out companies that don't manage their business' very well.|`|u23sBafTaa	Why would you even think that!

Are you trying to blame republicans?  If I'm not mistaken,  Unions boast of being Democratic so I will return the serve; how do democrats propose to save the American Automakers? Throwing taxpayer money at the problem is NOT the solution. It only postpones the inevitable.    In getting everything the union wanted, extremely high wages, huge pension plans, etc, etc the  ability to compete and make an affordable vehicle has been eliminated.     This is not a Republican thing. This is a business problem that the democratic unions were very much a part of creating. If the unions want to save jobs for those they represent then why don't they make concessions to keep the company solvent and able to retool to make fuel efficient cars that are affordable.  |`|rc4B8Vdaaa	The process of increasing State rescue operations started from the nationalization of Northern Rock Bank in Britain in September 2007, of Bear Sterns, one of the Big Four investment banks in the United States, in March 2008, and then reached a decisive turning point that precipitated the September-October maelstrom: the nationalization of the twin giants Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac controlling the four fifths of the collapsing US mortgage market, in September 2008.    The US Administration, of course, had no other alternative but to transgress its own founding principles of capitalist fundamentalism. It could not allow two Government Sponsored Enterprises with a debt equal to 40% of the US GDP just to collapse by the blows of the invisible hand. Such collapse meant chaos in the international financial system, a run on the dollar- and a declaration of default by the United States.    |`|LWYehm25aa	yeah...all the time >.>|`|uqyShjCwaa	No didn't you realize that it was the Republican party that actually FREED the African American slaves???|`|zUdxoRbyaa	when you have an Auto worker making 45.00 dollars an hour, its not hard to see why the Japanese cars are selling better.|`|G3EHDf11aa	the government should just take over the auto industry, give a car to every American, subsidize with tax payer money of course, because automobiles are a God-given right, along with owning a home, health care and $20 an hour wages for flipping burgers and washing windows|`|XFHleRhWaa	You have it it's just everyone will be a slave, the people that have something , will lose it all and then even DEMOCRATES will have to work for a living.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Every last one of them and 2/3 of the congress and senate deserve to be thrown in the pen!    All ofThe democrats will support them because they really don't want a federal investigation of why it failed.     McCain kept saying it was a shame 4 members of the house and senate now reside in federal penitentiaries. I say, it's a shame 400 aren't. They get bonuses because they are not businessmen, they are left wing political hacks. If they were to get jail time, it would Show through to the ones who appointed them and turned a blind eye to their criminal acts.    Like always, Liberals cause a mess, then hamper efforts to correct the problem, then blame Republicans for not fixing it perfectly to their complete, socialist, satisfaction. Bush was dealt a lousy hand but he played the cards he had, better than most thought he could have. He was still blamed for not producing a straight flush.     George Bush did Nothing to Conspire to Engineer this Economic Disaster. If capitalism was working it never would have happened. Democrat Socialist fascism may be playing a big part. The Government was forced to bail the banks out so the average Joe wouldn't lose everything.     Those who wished to do the most good and make housing affordable to the masses did the most harm.    Give me a good capitalist any day. I will guarantee you. If I was to make a loan for someone to buy a home. I would make a profit and they would be able to make the payments. People can screw things up, but, to really make a mess of things, it takes the Government. As it was, Government programs drove people into buying homes, the demand for housing went way up and by the simple laws of supply and demand, so did the cost of homes. When gasoline prices went up. People cut back and stopped buying homes. The demand for homes went way way down. By the simple laws of supply and demand the price of housing fell. The culpret was't capitalism it was socialism. Government interference in the free market. Warren and other good capitalists are stepping in to fix the disaster causes by Socialist ideas placed in actions by socialist congressional schemes.     Here's the way it worked    1 ) - Liberal democrats have always thought housing should be affordable to everyone.    2 ) - Liberal democrats made legislation and regulations forcing banks to make loans to people who couldn't afford to make payments on the loans.     3 ) - Liberal democrats needed to protect their campaign contributors in the banking and finance industry    4 ) - Liberal Democrats made laws and regulations forcing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy the bogus loans at the expense of the tax payers    5 ) - Liberal democrats and a few republicans got huge campaign contributions and     6 ) - Investigations and audits into the fraudulent practies of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were thwarted in congress and stopped before they left committee.     7 ) - No legitimate honest businessman would have participated in the ponzi scheme, knowing about the bogus loan scam. Being perpetrated by fannie and Freddie.     8 ) - Democrats placed dishonest political hacks in charge of Fannie and Freddie.    9 ) - The dishonest Democrat political hacks cooked the books to make it seem like fannie and Freddie were making profits. (what a surprise eh?)     10 ) - Democrats started to get wind some real bad stuff was about to happen and started a massive propaganda blitz saying "there's plenty of blame to go around" The meltdown was due to "deregulation" and "it was all about the greed" The truth, of course was The democrats were 90% of the blame. It was due to regulations. It was started about envy of the rich, The greed by some very wealthy democrats was a factor. This all was started and perpetuated as a socialist scheme to make housing affordable to everyone.     11) - True to form. There seems to be a media propaganda blitz calling this a failure of capitalism just in advance of the American public figuring out it was socialism. (what a surprise eh?)    All this revisionist histiory about "the Reagan-led destruction of the American Working Class in the 1980's??? Toward the end of the Reagan era we had a boom economy and almost full employment. The Reagan tax cuts generated countless millions of extra federal income. The mechanism whereby federal income is generated by lowering taxes is called stimulating the economy. The same dollar of tax revenue that was cut, got spent over and over many times and eventually taxed over, and over, many times. The net result is an increase in federal revenue after cutting taxes. Of course, being Democrats, they spent $1.47 of every extra dollar that was generated then blamed reagan for an increased deficit. They are trying to do the same things with Bush. Bush lowered taxes almost by himself after 9/11. He averted an almost certain economic disaster. The Federal government took on countless billions in extra revenue. The Democrats (Bush made the mistake of agreeing with democtats spending increases because he is a moderate not a conservative) spent nore then they took in and are blaming Bush for the increased deficit. In a real sense failure to act as a conservative gives him some of the blame for the deficit. Of course, acting more like a liberal with more spending won't help either. The last president to increase taxes (on the rich) in the time of a recession was Hoover and he caused the great depression. Roosevelt, in the insane belief that Government could create jobs, prolonged it.    The Democrats have made Reaganomics a bad word and Roosevelt a hero.    If we were to guess, what the democrats will do, it will be to make all the institutions they "bail out" into heros and Bush into the villain who caused their failures. Expect the next media blitz to be about that|`|Am1wfhBDaa	Their property seized and all their wealth stripped then awarded Prison time.|`|ac021f49fcd1ea8f56dc6a9389a933e9aa	They should be sent to prison and their personal fortunes be divided between all the EMPLOYEES that work for the company, NOT the stockholders (unless they are also an employee).|`|UvCA6ajZaa	With a very long sentance.

So if a CEO makes what you might think to be an unreasonable amount, that's up to the board and the shareholders.

But reflecting persons perceived that when society is itself the tyrant  society collectively over the separate individuals who compose it  its means of tyrannizing are not restricted to the acts which it may do by the hands of its political functionaries. Society can and does execute its own mandates; and if it issues wrong mandates instead of right, or any mandates at all in things with which it ought not to meddle, it practices a social tyranny more formidable than many kinds of political oppression, since, though not usually upheld by such extreme penalties, it leaves fewer means of escape, penetrating much more deeply into the details of life, and enslaving the soul itself. Protection, therefore, against the tyranny of the magistrate is not enough; there needs protection also against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling, against the tendency of society to impose, by other means than civil penalties, its own ideas and practices as rules of conduct on those who dissent from them; to fetter the development and, if possible, prevent the formation of any individuality not in harmony with its ways, and compel all characters to fashion themselves upon the model of its own. There is a limit to the legitimate interference of collective opinion with individual independence; and to find that limit, and maintain it against encroachment, is as indispensable to a good condition of human affairs as protection against political despotism.

Then some gay couples got their collective panties in a wad and decided that the will of the people meant nothing and that the will of the voters must be overturned. They sued and a moron judge decided that gays had the right to marry. It would appear that whatever the people voted on was not a vote to change the Constitution (though I am not sure how the convoluted California system works). In any event, the proposition (8) was placed on the ballot and it specifically called for changing the California constitution to define marriage as one man and one woman.    On November 4th, thanks to Barack Obama, Prop 8 passed and now gay marriage is illegal in California. Yes, blacks opposed the measure and since a record number of them turned out to vote for borther Barry, they also voted to squash gay marriage. The people who supported it are not happy and they are looking for ways to, once again, thwart the will of the people.    RINO Governor Schwarzenegger says he hopes it will be overturned in the courts. Ellen, Rosie and any number of other celebrities gay and straight alike are in a tizzy over the whole issue and they are looking for ways to negate the will of the people. Yes, those who supported it feel they have the right to overrule the HUGE majority of people who oppose gay marriage. But even if it passed by one vote, it is the will of the people.    The gays have been protesting in the streets and they have the support of some of the better known celebrities who support gay marriage. You see, the vote did not go the way they wanted so they are upset and looking to change it. This is how things work on their side of the world. When elections do not go their way they protest and raise hell. They look to the courts to change the will of the people by having them overturn what the voters decided. This time, the voters decided on an amendment to the Constitution in accordance with their law. They had a ballot initiative and one side lost. The courts should have NO say in this matter.    I imagine these celebrities (gay and straight) who are up in arms and want the results of the vote overturned would probably lose their liberal minds if Americans who voted for someone other than Obama started challenging the results in court and tried to get a Conservative judge to overturn the results. Dont get me wrong, there is a lawsuit in place but it deals with a Constitutional issue and will likely go nowhere since the Supreme Court lacks testicular fortitude.    Look, gay people in California and those who are upset with the outcome, you lost, get over it. Your side will not be walking down the aisle in the near future because the sane people in your state decided that they needed a constitutional amendment to clarify what should be common sense in accordance with nature and normalcy.     For the people  who refuse to pay your taxes over this, you could be in trouble. Melissa Etheridge has stated that since she is denied the right to marriage she will not pay her CA taxes. I dont agree with Obama being elected, does this mean I dont have to pay my federal taxes? I dont believe in taxpayer funded abortion so should I pay taxes if they are used for that?    The ruling of the people stands and it will be a part of the Constitution in California. If any judge overturns the will of the people this time they should drag him out of court and string him up.    As for the bleeding heart Governor Arnie, someone change his voter registration to Democrat. He is liberal and out of touch with what the Republican party stands for, like the rule of law, so throw him out and be done with it.    Must be what happens when you marry a Kennedy, half your brain is removed and you become a lib    You guys should be careful what you ask for.

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	What is happening to American gay and lesbian people in the USA is globally seen as plain down right homophobia and the  discrimination of there rights and freedoms.    In all modern civilized countries, like the country I live in we have anti discrimination laws, equal rights and freedoms for all citizens.     Americans openly brag the USA is the land of the free, it's even a verse in your national anthem. Yet millions of Americans have no equal human rights or anti discrimination laws and freedoms.     The vows of marriage do not contain any religious content, and billions of people globally have been and get married in totally non religious ceremony's.    Marriage is a life contract of commitment between two people who care, share  there love and life together as equal partners.    All the same people who voted against, gay marriage also voted for the don't ask don't tell laws in the armed services and voted against the sexual orientation anti discrimination laws.     These same people have wormed there way also to vote against gender discrimination. Where they want the government to fully control women's wombs and women's rights to get equal pay etc.    How do you truly feel knowing you don't have the same rights to equal pay, work conditions and the freedoms that all women do in the country I live in, as well women have in civilized countries  outside the US.     Are you going to be happy when these people vote so the US government can fully takes your rights away to control of your womb. Just like the US government has taken the rights away from American gay and lesbian people who want to get married.     I don't care or loose any sleep at night, if two people in a loving relationship choose to marry. Regardless of there gender or their sexual orientation. Being it's their personal business, not mine, the governments or anyone else's business.      How many Americans would protest if the US government said they couldn't get married if they weighed over 110 pounds and didn't have a million dollars in the bank. Only offering civil unions to people who didn't fit the governments marriage criteria.     It's no different than the US governments marriage criteria that is offered to all American gay's and lesbians who want to marry.    Maybe a US government referendum or vote proposition should be made against the bias people who always use there bigoted opinions against millions of Americans equal human rights.    Also the land of the free verse in the American national anthem  should be changed. To the land of phobic bias religious opinion.|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Why wasn't separate but equal enough?|`|MO8VRa46aa	I am neither married nor gay, so I can;t help with this one.|`|6b5e206cf842e2c403f70cd8a47142e0aa	Are you asking heterosexuals...?|`|dg0EBzYWaa	because to libs nothing is every enough i think the US could do every thing they ask and they still would be bisthing about something|`|klm8v4R1aa	They want their deviant behaviour institutionalized to make them feel better about their B pillaging.|`|IIMLMWRjaa	Why is the government involved in marriage at all?

I support gay equality... no matter what I have to end up calling it... If gays want to get "married" then I am ok with it... If they are willing to settle for a "civil union" then I am ok with that too... as long as the conservatives will back off and let them have it.|`|M48kbO2Yaa	As noted earlier, it's "Separate but Equal". This has not passed Constitutional muster. The government should have stayed out of the marriage business anyhow. Quibbling, what's the difference between a license to drive and a license to practice medicine and a license to install electrical outlets?    Separate but equal works for them, because there's a logical separation between professions and duties. A license of marriage is only state recognition of a union existing. The problem rises because gay men and women want some sort of legal union, so they can have some sorts of legal rights that allow them legal recourse like married people do. The problem is "marriage" is a religious institution that is thousands of years old, and religious people tend to get touchy about religious institutions.    The real solution is to get the state out of the business of "marriage", and get the state in the business of "civil unions" for everyone, not just gays, but everyone. Leave "marriage" for the churches. That way, if a gay couple wants to get "married", they can find a church that will let them do so. If they (or anyone else) wants to get rights, such as visitation in hospitals, insurance rates, etc. then they can get a "civil union" like everyone else.    Peace and prosperity.|`|tdJuvdeXaa	I love the first answer to this question; that sums everything up. I don't understand you people who can't imagine giving equal rights to gays and straights. Separate but equal is simply not right.    All you people saying liberals will never be satisfied, that's right, we won't be satisfied until all people are treated equally, at least by the govt. Is that so wrong? I'm sure that's what the racists said when those damn abolitionists tried to end slavery... oh, but that wasn't enough! They had to go and end segregation too! Please, tell me the difference... besides 'God doesn't like gays'. What happened to Jesus loving everyone? It's just as wrong to stop homosexuals from marrying as it is to allow interracial marriages-- that's apparently wrong according to the Bible as well. And besides, what about separation of church and state? Homosexuals should be legally, if not religiously, allowed to marry just like anyone else.    My suggestion is that there be legal marriage, which can be issued to everyone, and religious marriage. They can be the same ceremony, but perhaps two different marriage certificates. That way there can be equal rights AND separation of church and state.    What about atheists? They're allowed to marry, even though they violate one of the 10 commandmants: Love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your mind, and all your soul... or something like that. Therefore, it's clearly not a religious thing, because then you would hear more protest against atheists marrying... isn't violating the 10 commanments WAY worse than violating something else in the Bible?

Ce que l'on peut admettre, c'est que le rgime spcial de retraite constitue un "avantage en nature" et donc justifie un niveau de salaire plus bas que dans le priv. Dans ce cas, la meilleure solution consiste  valuer cet avantage et  le rintgrer dans la rmunration.    Attention: il faut TOUT prendre en compte.

Par contre il me parait nanmoins difficile de n'avoir qu'un seul rgime de retraite du fait de la spcificit de certains mtiers...  Mais on doit pouvoir rduire  2 ou 3 rgimes diffrents.    Il y a tout d'abord pas mal de mtiers particulirement durs pour l'organisme (chauffeurs routiers, pompiers, etc).. Plus ceux qui ont trait  la scurit, et ou, les reflexes sont donc des lements importants (conducteurs de trains, pilotes d'avions, etc)... Auquel on peut ajouter aussi l'arme (un soldat de 65 ans n'a peu tre pas les capacits physiques et d'endurance qu'il faudrait).    Maintenant il faut aussi voir que certaines de ces personnes peuvent aussi tre "recycles"... Un conducteur de train pourrait trs bien aussi,  partir d'un certain age, devenir "controleur" sans que cela nuise  la qualit du service...    Une bonne rforme des rgimes de retraite (donc pas seulement une rforme purement comptable) ncessitera donc aussi de rflechir aux volutions de carrire et changement de poste qui peuvent intervenir.    Maintenant il y aura aussi des cas qui promettent d'tre politiquement amusants. En effet parmi les rgimes spciaux il y a celui des artisans et commer?ants. Or ce rgime l est totalement diffrent du systme actuel car il ne s'agit pas d'un rgime par rpartition, comme nous le connaissons en tant que salari. Mais bien plutot d'une forme d'assurance, ces professions ayant une retraite base sur leur cotisation. Ce qui explique d'ailleurs que leurs retraites soient souvent minables...    Sauf que justement, la politique "librale" consiste  pousser vers ce mode de retraite, au moins partiellement... Alors, au nom de la suppression des rgimes spciaux, le gouvernement osera-t-il supprimer un rgime qui correspond  "l'idal" politique qu'il veut promouvoir? On verra ce que l'avenir dira sur ce point...|`|26e87ee1728852879fc1016b4f30ee1baa	Toute la question est de savoir qui paye le plus ? et de comparer ce qui est comparable....Un grand battage mdiatique ne cesse actuellement d'oprer une comparaison entre le nombre d'annuits ncessaires pour obtenir une retraite  taux plein, avec 37,5 dans le public et 40 dans le priv et de dduire de ces deux  chiffres que c'est inquitable.    Mais personne ne pense  prciser que le mme mot ? annuit ? correspond  des ralits tellement diffrentes dans les deux rgimes que la comparaison n'a gure de sens : Autant donc ajouter des torchons et des serviettes !    Dmonstration :    Nous avons tous appris  l'cole qu'on n'ajoute pas des choux et des carottes ou des torchons et des serviettes. Tout comptable sait que des comparaisons ne sont valables que si elles sont effectues "  structure comparable ".    En tant que scientifique, j'ai le devoir, lorsque je compare deux donnes chiffres, de commencer par vrifier qu'elles correspondent  la mme ralit, par exemple elles sont exprimes dans la mme unit.  Sinon, on peut faire dire absolument n'importe quoi aux chiffres.    Le mot " annuit " correspond en fait  un nombre issu de calculs totalement diffrents dans les deux rgimes. En gros :    - Dans le public, le nombre d'annuits correspond au temps o l'on occupe effectivement un emploi, au prorata du temps de travail (ainsi, 1 an de travail  mi-temps donne une demi-annuit, 1 an  80% donne 0,8 annuit, etc.).    - Dans le priv, c'est bien plus compliqu. Cela dpend d'abord des sommes per?ues :  On valide, pour chaque anne civile, un nombre de trimestres correspondant au salaire soumis  cotisations dans l'anne.  C'est ainsi, pour prendre un exemple, qu'un cadre qui a travaill 3 mois dans une anne civile obtiendra une annuit entire (alors qu'un smicard qui a travaill 3 mois n'obtiendra lui que 0,5 annuit : est-ce bien quitable ?).    De mme, un an de travail  mi-temps compte pour une annuit complte. On rajoute ensuite certaines priodes non travailles : ch?mage (en partie), cong parental (sous conditions), etc.  A cela s'ajoutent des bonifications qui diffrent totalement entre les deux rgimes, dont la bonification pour enfant accorde aux mres (2 ans dans le priv, 1 dans le public)(1).    En rsum il est parfois plus " facile " d'obtenir des annuits dans le priv que dans le public.    Voil un exemple qui montre bien les limites de cette comparaison.    Puisque les mdias se sont fait l'cho de certains avantages (oubliant les inconvnients) des femmes fonctionnaires mres de 3 enfants, prenons l'exemple d'une mre de 3 enfants qui dcide de travailler 8 ans  mi-temps pour les lever :    - - Si elle est dans le priv, elle aura une bonification de 6 annuits et les 8 ans  mi-temps compteront pour huit annuits. Pour obtenir une retraite  taux plein (40 annuits), il lui faudra donc obtenir 40-8-6, soit 26 annuits supplmentaires.    - - Si elle est fonctionnaire, la bonification sera de 3 annuits et les 8 ans  mi-temps compteront pour 4 annuits. Pour obtenir une retraite  taux plein (37,5 annuits), il lui faudra travailler effectivement 30,5 annes  plein temps.    Est-ce bien quitable ?  ______________________________________...  (1) Vous pensez peut-tre que ce projet, qui se veut quitable, va revenir sur cette diffrence ? Dtrompez-vous : s'il instaure une validation des priodes de cong parental, le projet supprime purement et simplement la bonification d'un an des femmes fonctionnaires, pour les enfants ns aprs le 1er janvier 2004 !  Mais la suite parait claire : s'il passe, vous entendrez dans quelques annes  la tlvision : " Dans le priv il y a une bonification de 2 ans par enfant qui n'existe pas pour les fonctionnaires,  > c'est inquitable ". Et on supprimera la bonification des mamans du priv !  ______________________________________...    > Tout cela pour dire que comparer le nombre d'annuits ncessaires pour obtenir une retraite  taux plein dans les deux rgimes et en dduire que ce serait inquitable car 37,5 est infrieur  40 n'a aucun sens et relve de l'imposture.    D'autant plus que la notion de " retraite  taux plein " n'a strictement rien  voir entre les deux rgimes et qu'on ne tient pas compte des retraites complmentaires du priv !    Un jour o j'avais pris un narque en flagrant dlit de comparaison de chiffres incomparables, il m'avait rpondu : " D'accord, mais vous, vous vous intressez au sujet. Pour les gens, il faut des ides simples !".    > Je ne voudrais pas que l'opinion publique soit convaincue que les fonctionnaires seraient des privilgis du simple fait que les mdias colportent une ide aussi simple qu'inexacte.  > II n'empche que cette stratgie de dresser le priv contre le public, sur la base d'une " ide simple " permet de faire passer au second plan certaines ralits.    > Elle permet d'oublier que la rforme Balladur de 93, en augmentant la dure de cotisation de 37,5  40 ans (l on peut comparer les donnes puisque c'est le mme rgime), mais surtout par l'introduction de la dcote et l'allongement de la priode de rfrence, a dj diminu et surtout va encore dgrader fortement les retraites du priv.     Elle permet de faire passer au second plan que la rforme ne concerne pas les seuls fonctionnaires, puisque l'on va passer pour tous, de 40 annuits en 2008  environ 42 en 2020. C'est faire oublier un des principes de ce projet de loi, qui me pose personnellement problme.  > Alors que depuis le dix-neuvime sicle, l'augmentation de la richesse de la France (et des pays riches) est alle de pair|`|56b0e1da6a5237bd02fa257524e8b825aa	Bien sur que non, mais ils ne vont pas perdre ce privilge sans ragir...en vain.|`|01a96229a80c1c74d3056030318c5febaa	Certains rgimes spciaux ne pourront plus (certains ne peuvent dj plus ) assurer le paiement des retraites et ce n'est pas au rgime gnral de prendre le relais!

They're just initially holding you until the judge can do an arraignment on whatever minor offense you have committed.

In theory, any crime can cause you to spend a night in a cell in a police station; even the smallest misdemeanor.  Sometimes the police won't even waste their time; they will just give you a citation or a summons to court.  However, many times you are only being held there until they "can get" the bail bondsman.  Police have a saying, if you behave like a gentleman, we will treat you like a gentleman.  If you are a jerk, magically the bail bondsman can't be reached until the next morning, causing you to spend the night in jail.    Another issue is the timing of the arrest.  If you got arrested just after the bail bondsman was there, you are out of luck and will be there a while.    You could be spending the night in a real "jail" (not just a police station or even a prison) for a couple of reasons.  Smaller towns may not have many cells in there stations, and may be regularly housing the town drunks or vagrants.  If there is no room and / or the crime is serious enough, you may be transported to a jail.  From there you could make bail or sit there until your arraignment, which is the next day or on Monday.|`|zF9A2dhHaa	disorderly conduct, public intoxication.

Par contre le vrai risque de tout ?a est de donner le nuclaire civil  n'importe qui et de se retrouver avec un tchernobyl tous les ans. encore une fois le nuclaire c'est pas simple, on a souvent fr?l la catastrophe (Bulgarie, Sude, japon), on a fait des catastrophes (tchernobyl, Three Miles island), donner le nuclaire civil  tout le monde serait une bourde.

Its a win win, we will be back to normal in no time.|`|IDZTtipeaa	The economic collapse we have recently experienced was the result of many factors.  The largest would be the mortgage situation, in which subprime, no money down mortgages were willfully given out to a lot of people while housing prices were rapidly rising and the market quickly expanding.  These mortgages were broken up, repackaged, given high ratings (which they did not deserve), the sold and resold and resold.  When the housing market started to slow and some started to default on their mortgages, all hell broke loose.  People started to realize that our 401Ks were artificially inflated on the buying and selling of debt, which wasn't being repaid.  The downward spiral continues today and will continue further.  Deficit spending under Bush was not the root cause of all the problems we currently face.  the proposed deficit spending under Obama is not the same kind of spending as happened under Bush, and the effects are hard to predict, but it is likely that the spending won't by itself, solve our current economic crisis.|`|xVRGz3Oaaa	They will not work, just makes the problem worse--like what FDR did--spend spend spend and economy in worse shape 4 years later.|`|gZJ1EQx5aa	They won't.

AA10829445	Yes - as an accessory to the crime.  The driver of a get away car during a bank robbery ( who never gets out of the car - just drives) is as guilty  as the people who go in and rob the bank.  If someone is shot the driver is also guilty.    You need a defense lawyer.  Whatever you tell your lawyer is protected by lawyer-client confidential privilege clauses.  Once you dismiss the lawyer (before trial) that lawyer, as an officer of the court has a responsibility to tell the police /authorities.  So, be very, very careful what you do now.  As an accessory to the crime, you can be charged with the same crimes as the perpetrator- that's why you need a lawyer.  Remember, they can identify cars from traces on the house and/or witnesses.    If you cannot afford a lawyer, you can get a public defender to take your case.  Just do something fast.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	Knew of the gun accomplice, if you where planning on committing a felony but not a killing but your partner does felony murder  |`|sB5fbE8saa	I believe so.

What the Democrats want is for late term abortions to be available to a woman if she needs them for medical necessity.  The Republicans, every time they push that bill to ban late term abortion, never put in a clause to make it legal to save the mothers life.  It is actually unconstitutional to ban it without the exception for the health of the mother.  The Supreme Court has ruled this already in the 90's.  But the GOP still tries to do it because it is used as a wedge issue to rally the unthinking knee jerk reactionaries.  The lies surrounding this issue are immense.  All of them having to do with this being an irrational emotional issue.  Just be happy that someone is fighting for you rights.  Because if a late term abortion needs to be done, that means you might die.  There is no use forcing you to carry it if both of you die in the end.  But that logic has never stopped the GOP.

He describes his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as "non-practicing Methodists and Baptists") to be detached from religion, yet "in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known." He describes his father as "raised a Muslim", but a "confirmed atheist" by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as "a man who saw religion as not particularly useful."|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Christian. :-)|`|AA12121752	Listen to the man himself    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=XKGdkqfBIC...|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	Now that's a loaded question.

True believers do not act in such a way the verse "depart from me I never knew you" is something they should ponder on.  I pray that Mr Obama will do the right thing not just for America   ( which is what some of his predecessors have done) but for peace in the world as a whole, I know that over the past few yrs America has become like Britain under Thatcher not very nice,as long as we're ok sod the rest --and we'll get rid of anyone not holding my views and beliefs attitude--it is time to join the rest of the people who share this world (USA is not the world it is PART of the world  it is time to remember we must share what we have to make peace with our neighbours who are different to us and to leave this planet a more peaceful and loving world when we leave it. This is the Christian belief and we grieve our Heavenly Father when we do not do this.

So when active duty reenlistments are high ( like they are now ) , that makes it hard for prior service to get back in.    When reenlistments are low, then it is easier for prior service to get back in.    Also, recruiters do not get any credit, for prior service.    They only get credit for new enlistments.    Sure there is a way to avoid all that, don't separate and reenlist while your still active.

They could care less that you offer the military much more than a fresh recruit but the recruits are easier to BS and intimidate, plus its less time and paperwork for a new recruit.

En 1936, a l'poque, le marchal Lyaute  encourageait chaque Fran?ais a lire ce livre afin de se rendre compte de ce qui allait se passer!La premire version de Mein kampf en fran?ais et de traduction intgrale(elles ne le sont plus) est prface par lui:   "tout fran?ais doit lire ce livre........"   Le racisme antismite battait son plein! Hitler tait un monstre en proie a dominer le monde!    Pendant le gouvernement de vichy le juif devint la bte noir des fran?ais et on l'appelait le rat!  De part son mode de vie en communaut, le juif a fait de lui mme son exclusion a cette poque!    La shoah a permis au monde de se reconcilier avec les juifs aprs l'armistice et la dcouverte des camps de la morts!  On les a plaint et on leur a rendu la terre promise a tort peut tre mais a vote majoritaire entre toutes les grandes puissances du monde!  D'ailleurs c'est la voix des fran?ais qui a t dcisive!    De nos jours le juif controle la presse,les mdias et est entr en politique! ce qui a activ le racisme contre lui!  Et la mauvaise conomie relative actuelle refait sortir le fait que le juif est riche, banquier et qu'il est responsable de tous les maux du monde!    N'oublions pas comme le faisait remarquer Hitler que le peuple juif a condamn le christ contre Barabas et l'a fait crucifier!  Et oui, encore une caricature!    Je respecte ce peuple autant que les autres et je suis bien triste que des terroristes soient mis sur un pidestal parcequ'on ne les aime pas!    La cause palestinienne est juste, pas celle du Hamas!

Hopefully your family will come around and realize this over time.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Fortunately, you do not have to worry about what to do.  It will not be your decision to "press" or "drop" charges.  If charges are filed, it will be by a prosecuting attorney.  If charges are to be dismissed, it will be by a judge upon motion of the prosecuting attorney.

108dd144b67a8cb2a13f084607bb9925aa	Presuming the late arrivals were due to the pregnancy, just be honest and say that you were having a difficult pregnancy and that made for some medical challenges.  All things being equal, if you were having difficulties then because of the pregnancies, you should have just told your employer then and filed for a Family Medical Leave protection.  Even now, though, if you indicate you were pregnant or had a medical issue that caused the tardiness, it's likely they won't explore too much beyond that statement.  It gets very tricky for them, legally,  to ask questions about your health (past or present), so as long as you can indicate you're solid now...they may pass over it.|`|474222dd96cd15ed831bbcf891fdbdd8aa	I would be calm, look them in the eye and shake their hand and thank them for the opportunity to interview with them and their company.

If they ask you a direct question related to your past with them, just say that was a very trying time in your life, a lot of changes occurred but that you are more grounded now. Don't elaborate further, let them come up with a line of questioning. But in all seriousness, they need people with experience and if you get far enough in the interview process  that your sitting in front of someone you probably have it. If you get the job, make sure you have a backup person for babysitter in case kids are sick. |`|tvoc41q4aa	Just answer them truthfully. The very fact that you got an interview again tells me that they want you. It is easy for a retail store to take an experienced employee because it is cheaper for them as there is no need to train you. You just have to be able to relate them to your pregnancy and make sure you don't make the same mistake. Also, find a creche for your twins. I am sure this will be a subject, because if I am your employer, I want to make sure you do something constructive so as to not make the same mistake again. Good luck.

I am pro-defense, and if that means we have to go to war, then so be it.    i support the second amendment    i am pro-life, no one should have the choice to kill a child just for convienience    i am for gays having rights as human beings, but dont agree with gay marriage or eliminating the military's "don't ask don't tell policy" the military relies on unit cohesion to function well, and allowing open gays would erode some of that.    I think that to blame global warming on human's actions is pretty arrogant. the earth's climate goes through normal cycles, we see it on a small scale with the change of seasons. just remember, we recovered from an ice age long before people drove SUVs...its natural for the earth to warm and cool itself over time.    thanks for the opportunity to share :)|`|9641e41e4359f10f749cb3fdf582a33aaa	i believe war is a sad horrible thing but if its neccesary, then we need to go into one.    i believe that abortions are a bad thing and that ur killing someone if u have one..imagine if u weren't here right now cuz ur mom had an abortion    i am not really for or against gay rights...i believe gays r wonderful ppl just like everyone else and they should have as much freedom as other ppl, but they shouldn't be allowed to marry     i believe that pissing away tax payer's money on dumb stuff and escpecially sending money over seas (something obama is happily doing) is the dumbest thing u can do right now    i believe that global warming is a total hoax...i mean how cold does it have to get for liberals to stop believing in global warming?    i am pro testing on animals...it is so sad and i try not to think of wut happens to the animals, but we have to realize that its them or us that we can test things on, and harming a human is much worse than harming an animal    i believe that it is ok to kill animals but ONLY for things we need, such as food, and that it is absolutly disgusting that some ppl hunt them cuz they think its fun to kill poor innocent animals, and that its disgusting that some ppl use them for stupid fashionable fur coats    i believe that obama's tax plan is stupid cuz why should ppl who work hard for their money and actually make an effort to go to school have to give up their money for other ppl who sit around? poor ppl can always go to college...ever heard of a student loan and a job?|`|fLH4ILzbaa	You are Libertarian.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	1.

Michael Steele served as Lieutenant Governor of Maryland from 2003 to 2007 under Governor Robert Ehrlich.    Steele was the first African American to serve in a Maryland state-wide office and the first Republican lieutenant governor in the state. At the time he was the highest-ranking elected African American Republican in the United States.      In 1995, the Maryland Republican Party selected him as Maryland State Republican Man of the Year. He worked on several political campaigns, was an Alternate Delegate to the 1996 Republican National Convention in San Diego and a Delegate to the 2000 Republican National Convention in Philadelphia that ultimately chose the George W. Bush ticket.    In December 2000, Steele was elected chairman of the Maryland Republican Party, becoming the first African American ever to be elected chairman of any state Republican Party.    So, no....nobody has "pulled" Michael Steele "out of nowhere".    So uninformed....so sad.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Well Obama was just a senate while Palin is the governor of Alaska.

Have some more kool-aid!|`|noo8vpvzaa	Steele has been working in our government FAR longer than OBAMA...No one outside of Illinois ever heard of Obama until 2 years ago    Just because you are unaware of someone's existence, that doesn't mean that they didn't exist until now.    1. Michael Steele, who was adopted as an infant, was born at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's County, Md., on Oct. 19, 1958.    2. He grew up in a family of Democrats. Steele credits his mother, Maebell, and Ronald Reagan with turning him toward the Republican Party. Reagan's pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps message recalled a trait Steele's mother exhibited after her first husband, Steele's father, died in 1962 of alcoholism-related liver disease. She refused to go on welfare. Instead, she went to work as a laundress earning minimum wage to support Michael and his sister.    3. One of the first in his family to go to college, he earned a bachelor's degree in international relations from Johns Hopkins University and a law degree from Georgetown University Law Center. Steele also spent a few years at the Augustinian Friars Seminary at Villanova University, in preparation for the priesthood, before deciding instead on a career in civil service.    4. After graduating from law school in 1991, Steele joined Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, an international law firm, based in Washington, D.C. In 1997, he left and worked briefly at the Mills Corp., a real estate development firm based in Virginia, as in-house counsel. He then went out on his own, starting a consulting firm, the Steele Group.    5. Steele rose quickly in the Republican Party, beginning at the local level in Prince George's County as chair of the Prince George's County Republican Central Committee from 1994 to 2000. Then, he was elected chairman of the Maryland Republican Party in December 2000.    6. Steele was elected to statewide office in Maryland, taking office as lieutenant governor in January 2003.    7. In 2004, Steele was tapped to speak at the Republican National Convention.    8. When Sen. Paul Sarbanes, a Democrat, announced he would not seek re-election, several prominent Republicans, including President Bush, persuaded Steele to run for the Senate seat. In November 2006, Steele lost the election to Democrat Ben Cardin.    9. On Feb. 1, 2007, Steele was named the chairman of GOPAC, a political action committee working to elect Republicans to office (Newt Gingrich once held the same position).    10. A devout Catholic, Steele is a member of St. Mary's Catholic Church in Landover Hills, Md. He regularly attends services with his wife, Andrea, and their sons, Michael and Drew.|`|fLH4ILzbaa	Steele has been around for years.|`|1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	He is well known in the U.S.    My wife loves him more than me.|`|IHIiyyCTaa	They' er so simple...|`|WoESqX8gaa	Heck no,Micheal Steele is a accomplished politician.Try again please.You realize Obama was a junior senator with 2 years devoted for his campaign for the presidency.You want to talk about someone who has never finished his term as senator.

They believe everything they see like on completely fictional movies like 'the patriot'.

What the Yanks don't seem to realise is that it was in-fact a civil war, between British against British colonies.

To be honest im glad we left you there an then, you've turned out to be such a crap nation which will ultimately destroy itself soon enough.
48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Actually, he is doing more than the law requires.  It is only illegal to conceal a weapon on your person or in a vehicle.  (Pen C 12025.)  There is generally no requirement that it be in a locked box (though that is one way to legally conceal a handgun in a vehicle), but it is a VERY good idea.  He is wrong about the "private property" exception, however, since that applies only on property he owns.  (Pen C 12026.)  The weapon is not loaded, but if the owner approved, he could also load it at the owner's place of business.  (Pen C  12031, subd. (h).)    However, legality aside, this may not be something that the theater owner would approve.  The police cannot do anything absent a law violation, but if you are uncomfortable you might think about discussing it with your employer.|`|JUN2QcqEaa	It actually depends.

This is how you're supposed to transport the weapon off of private property, so it's legal to do just about anywhere.

Da una parte folle di diplomati e laureati che non sanno una mazza di nulla...completamente ignoranti....e tra questi c' anche chi, grazie a forti raccomandazioni, riuscir ad occupare ruoli di responsabilit con l'unico obiettivo di decretare lo sfascio di quell'ufficio; dall'altra parte la carenza cronica di tanti mestieri importanti (calzolaio, idraulico, muratore, falegname, badanti, ecc.) e di braccia necessarie per l'agricoltura, per l'industria e per il terziario...braccia che oggi sono per lo pi quelle degli extracomunitari, per di pi anche tanto contestati da tanti cretini....|`|hgbcnPyRaa	No!  o meglio, non solo...  Essere colti e istruiti non equivale ad essere civili o capaci di effettuare delle rivoluzioni.  Sono gli Ideali, i principi e la voglia di cambiare il mondo che spinge una persona a cercare di realizzare queste speranze per il mondo.  certo i libri aiutano, ma bisogna vedere quali libri sono.  Un teologo, pur avendo studiato parecchio, non maturer mai, ideali di rivoluzione, ma di conservazione...    Io non sono un grande studioso, ma ho studiato parecchio anche da solo, e non solo sui libri di scuola, perch spinto dalla voglia di capire e conoscere.  Col tempo poi ho sviluppato i miei ideali di libert, giustizia e la voglia di cambiare cio' che ai miei occhi risulta sbagliato nel mondo.  Ma posso anche sbagliare, perch non  detto che quello che io reputo sbagliato, lo sia per tutti!    Bisogna oltre che studiare, anche saper osare.   Mi viene in mente un immagine, :)  quella di un guerriero, ma che non combatte con le classiche armi, ma con un bel testo di scienza in mano, e aperto come a simboleggiare uno scudo, e nell'altra la carta dei diritti dell'uomo, dove sono scritti i principi di libert, ugualianza e fratellanza.

La rivoluzione vera si fa con le idee e non con le armi. Un'idea diffusa dura molto piu' di un governo militare e questo la storia l'ha dimostrato ampiamente. I libri sono le armi delle idee. In ogni regime la censura e' richiesta necessaria per la sopravvivenza del medesimo ed e' proprio sfidando la censura con scritte sparse nella storia che grandi rivoluzioni sono state compiute.   Il senso della tua domanda pero' e' leggermente differente. La rivoluzione si fa dando cultura. Sicuramente le rivoluzioni individuali non si possono ottenere in altro modo. In realta' credo pero' che molte rivoluzioni sociali abbiano bisogno di una parte di individui che non abbiano compiuto una rivoluzione personale per poter essere massa-strumento (questa e' la mia parte pratica che parla! :P).  Sono comunque sicura che se quel padre e' riuscito nel suo intento sara' stato fiero del figlio. Dando cultura a un figlio gli dai le ali per sognare e i piedi per camminare sulla propria strada sicuro, realizzandosi come individuo. La realizzazione personale non e' affatto legata alla fama. Quindi se un individuo riesce a sfruttare gli strumenti che la sua istruzione gli ha fornito per realizzare le sue potenzialita' e il suo cammino qualunque esso sia, non sara mai un "nessuno"...sara' come dicono i Placebo "uno". Essere "uno" e' il fine massimo a cui ogni essere umano puo' tendere.    Xmas: che bella frase la tua risposta. Mi risuona ancora nelle orecchie. Complimenti.|`|1caf1752427229129db05c796c6546dbaa	chp!    Domanda eccellente!!!    le rivoluzioni hanno avuto sempre un grande libro come fedele compagno:  dal Nuovo testamento, al Capitale, passando per S. Agostino, Tommaso d'Aquino, Erasmo da Rotterdam, Lutero, Copernico, Galileo, Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Ghandi...  ( ometto i contemporanei come Gramsci o Giovanni Paolo II per evitare giustificabili polemiche).    sar anche per questo che le grandi proteste di cambiamento hanno visto studenti al fianco della gente...  Praga, Budapest, il 68 parigino, l'autunno caldo 69, Tyen ammenn 89...    Ogni vera rivoluzione si fa con il PENSIERO, che muove gli animi in un solo cuore.  il pensiero arriva attraverso le PAROLE...     E I LIBRI SONO FATTI DI PAROLE.    ....."Gi. Ma le parole voglion dire qualche cosa.    ? Figurati. Ed  proprio per questo che bisogna stare attenti a quelle che si scelgono. Secondo che uno scrittore adopera certe parole o certe altre, tu capisci chi . Prendi i compagni della guerra di Spagna: chi li chiamava rossi, chi lealisti, chi comunisti e sovversivi, chi patrioti. Ognuna di queste parole ti chiariva con chi parlavi, e veniva a significare una cosa diversa. Nelle parole che tu adoperi c' la tua classe e il tuo lavoro, quello che sai, quello che mangi, le persone che frequenti. C' tutto nelle parole.    ? Ma in un libro c' anche una storia, dei personaggi. Noi si diceva che dovresti parlarci di questo. Un operaio come me, se legge un libro, difficilmente sa dire la sua. Le parole le capisco. Ma succedono cose nei libri, che non sempre mi convincono.    Se non vanno le cose, non van neanche le parole, credi a me.    ? Ma ci sono dei libri che sembran ben scritti, e poi sotto ti accorgi che l'autore  d'accordo con quelli che ammazzano il popolo. Mica ha il coraggio di dirlo, ma ti pianta su una storia dove tutti di te se ne infischiano. Ti presenta un ambiente che non si sa di dove vengono le cene che mangiano e quel che consumano. Mai che si dica che senza la classe operaia questa gente non avrebbe neanche il bagno. Mai che si sappia che il mondo non finisce con loro...."

Ancora oggi in certe zone del sud i braccianti analfabeti sono detti "cafoni", e sono facile preda di chi li disprezza e li sfrutta anche per i propri fini ideologici e politici di conservazione del privilegio. Il libro  certo uno strumento potente, ed io non lo temo nemmeno quando diventa portatore di veleni: non mi spaventano gli storici cosiddetti "revisionisti" che negano l'olocausto, posso seppellirli sotto decine di altre testimonianze scritte, fotografate, filmate, sotto le voci di una cultura che ha anche il compito di purificare se stessa dagli scarti senza accendere fal, lasciando i fal a tutte le tirannidi in atto od in potenza che sempre ne hanno fatto uso, in senso stretto o talora in modo pi raffinato ma non perci meno brutale: penso a certo "editto bulgaro" di tempi non troppo lontani.  Mi rimane quel piccolo dubbio iniziale: la cultura ci rende liberi o quanto meno pi liberi; ma forse occorre andare oltre, maturare nuove consapevolezze,  al di l, forse, di quelle in parte offuscate o smarrite, non perdersi..

c7669ac697843ef21aded7aa1ad15f1eaa	Bene, ti rispondo con estrema certezza, essendoci coinvolto personalmente....Prima di tutto ancora il nostro Governo non ci ha dotato di giubotti antiproiettile comodi e indossabili almeno x il 70 % delle FF.di.PP. in quanto quelli che si hanno in dotazione sono pesantissimi e scomodi da indossare, infatti vengono usati raramente proprio x questo motivo. Secondo, causa il primo motivo e difficile nell'eventualit inseguire o mettersi immediatamente alla guida dell'auto causa le dimensioni abnormi che ha. Purtroppo in Italia la sicurezza sia del cittadino e sia di chi la dovrebbe garantire  ai minimi confronto agli altri stati europei e del terzo mondo........spero sia stato esaustivo, saluti Francesco.|`|39e1a65e7fe627710d900e92566d6179aa	I giubbotti antiproiettile sono di vari tipi a seconda della protezione balistica che sono in grado di offrire, ossia a quale tipo di calibro possono resistere (ad es. classe 1 che resiste fino a proiettili sparati con pistole cal. 9x19).  Per inciso, ad ogni calibro corrisponde la coppia di valori significativi, ossia qual' la velocit raggiungibile e quale l'energia cinetica dei proiettili di quel calibro.  Ci premesso, si usano soltanto in caso di prevedibile pericolo di conflitto a fuoco perch:  1) anche i pi "leggeri" hanno spessore e peso rilevante per cui sono abbastanza scomodi da indossare (specie col caldo) e non possono essere celati agevolmente sotto i normali abiti (in divisa li indossi sopra);  2) sono abbastanza rigidi per cui limitano i movimenti.  Dal momento che essi non proteggono la testa n il collo n l'addome che sono zone vitali, si valuta caso per caso se il rischio prevedibile compensi la scomodit d'uso e le limitazioni connesse all'uso del giubbotto.  In taluni casi si indossano ulteriori protezioni balistiche per la testa ed il collo e delle sorte di corti "grembiulini" che proteggono l'addome fino al terzo superiore delle cosce.|`|20787a76707df387c2969fc095e17866aa	lo indossano solo per andare in bagno perch qualcuno gli ha detto che bisogna stare attenti agli stro.nzi ch sparano!    cmq  davvero pesante e rende difficili i movimenti!|`|ccbc2d031b0161c2e121ce7c664e28e1aa	perche' usano lo scudoumano|`|d05e23a8fe7f4cdfb6ca427fcbf8c393aa	ha un peso increbidile, ed  proprio per questo, che essendo cos pesante, risulta a volte scomodo...tipo negli inseguimenti, o anche per il santo piacere di muoversi...  e poi non  cos frequente, fortunatamente, il fatto di essere "impallinati" mentre si va in giro..|`|42324f37c75bd84674cef7e6dc48a705aa	io non sono un poliziotto ma me ne intndo perche nelle filippine i miei zii tra cui uno in caserma ederle..a vicenza si quello americano...cmq nn lo indossano perche e pesante...limita i movimenti...e perche non sanno che proietile li trapassera in quel momento....cioe magari indossano un giubotto legero ma gli sparano un proiettile blindato allora non serve a niente ..o no ???|`|692dba7e84f5b51e5aab80e0f88af622aa	Non sono un poliziotto o altro, i giubbotti hanno un peso intorno al chilo e mezzo fino a 3 circa, il problema e che costano parecchio 600 700 euro, quindi penso che non ne abbiano per tutti contando che i fondi non sono sufficienti a sostituire neanche il loro parco auto.  naturalmente le mie sono solo supposizioni.

Just curious...why, exactly, do you support obama and, more importantly, the democrat idiology with regard to minorities?  I ask this because you state very plainly that you "know what side our bread is buttered on...and it's not the Republicans side."  I would really like to know.  What is it that the Republicans want that you don't, or vice-versa, with regards to minorities?    Thank you for that honest reply.  If Republicans didn't support it, there wouldn't be any "big money" for the democrats to spend on the "less fortunate." And I am assuming you didn't cash those two stimulus checks that Bush sent your way in the past year?  Unfortunately, the dems take advantage of the "less fortunate" by filling your head full of hopes and dreams and keeping you in a disadvantaged position where you need to rely on the government for support.  The dems just love this kind of "devotion"...it keeps them elected.  Wise up and get out of the ghetto mentality...Republicans are historically the more christian conservatives who give more of their money and time to those less fortunate.  They just don't go around bragging about it and using it as a tool to keep the "less fortunate" in a less fortunate position.
Cc9MEn9Caa	These modern day smarmy politicians talk about democracy old chap, but we all know we're being thoroughly shafted by the capitalist machine. Perhaps it would be better to be shafted by a Tzar of some sort, waving from a high balcony as his tanks roll by on the square below than to be told how much better off we are while some a*sehole banker "retires" with a 3 million pound handout. This democracy our "benevolent" government speaks of is no more than an effort to keep us distracted with plasma screens we can't afford while they sit around in the corridors of power talking out of their a*ses.

Next, we could recover the armed forces from Iraq and Afghanistan and deploy them to our own borders in order to put an immediate halt to illegal immigrants entering the UK.  Then, get rid of our unemployment problem by expanding the UKBA and sending teams of inspectors throughout the country to round up all illegal immigrants currently living within the UK in a massive search and capture "sweep" of the UK.  Once rounded up, they can be immediately deported to their home countries, along with the hundreds of thousands of economic migrants from the EU countries.  Next, get rid of all of the "positive discrimination" legislation which has been introduced over the past 30 odd years in the guise of "equal rights" for minority groups - EVERYONE should have a fair crack of the whip, but we should NEVER positively discriminate against the indiginous people of this country !!  Then, adopt a policy of "zero tolerance" to crime and "yob culture".  Where necessary, expand the housing capacity of the prison system by using redundant army camps (you know - the old missen hut ones), which can be guarded by the military who have not been deployed to border duties.  Obviously, there would be a zero tolerance policy towards prisoner misbehaviour or complaint and a complete banning of niceties currently enjoyed by prisioners, such as TV, playstations, snooker etc, etc.  Next, those "British" citizens who are decended from the more recent "tsunami" of uncontrolled immigration (ie: the last 20 years or so) should be required to speak English (fluently) and intergrate FULLY into the indiginous British culture, rather than (as at present) seek to convert the country into a mirror of their ancestoral homeland and swear an oath of allegance to the BRITISH country.  Obviously, failure to complete (or uphold) any of these conditions would result in immediate deportation.  Finally, there should be a requirement for all citizens to keep their religion where it belongs - in their hearts/minds, rather than constantly sticking it in the face of others, or using it to try and make themselves "more" of a citizen than others !|`|8c26794a87dbf74cd24ea326b3136147aa	The empire was a democracy.

Un discorso a parte va fatto per il Cavaliere : Il motivo della sua entrata in politica, non  un segreto per nessuno come le sue denunce contro la Magistratura , come si dice ? l' attacco  la miglior difesa, ma queste cose le sapiamo tutti , anche chi fa finta di non saperle ha capito la situazione.  Ormai una parte  della informazione cerca di non affrontare il problema ( tengo famiglia ) oppure solo superficialmente.   I tifosi pi incalliti del Cavaliere pare abbiano tirato le somme del suo modo di governare, molta pubblicit molte chicchere ,proclami tipo ventennio ma stringi ,stringi in mano non rimane nulla e cominciano a dileguarsi.

E impensabile che in 5 anni non siano riunisciti a stabilizzarsi ma anzi, con questa concentrazione di pecore cattoliche che ci affiancano rimpiango quasi gli anni della DC.  Pensassero meno a Berlusconi e alla inverosimile opposizione che sta cercando di fare il centro-destra e sono sicuro che 1/3 dei mali della maggioranza sarebbe sanata per via del surplus di energie mentali che si ritroverebbero.    Non  una critica alla tua domanda con la quale sono anzi totalmente daccordo, alla luce del fatto che  stato tra laltro lo stesso Enzo Biagi anni fa a svelare le confidenze personali che Berlusconi gli fece sul fatto di essere entrato in politica proprio per evitare i braccialetti dargento.

Abortion is just one of the religious doctrines they want the government to enforce as theocratic law.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I don't know, but I disagree with you, at least in political theory.  Obviously, the law is not our conscience, so Christians do not need to get abortions.    But in political theory, our government is a Constitutional one.  And Roe v. Wade was radical judicial legislation, which subverted State's Rights, under the 10th Amendment.  If you think this is not a big deal, consider the Civil War.    And remember the slippery slope argument:  Today abortion is legal.  If no one fights it, next it will be manditory.  And after that euthenasia will become legal.  And after that, euthenasia will be manditory.    Muse, that is no Christian dogma I've ever heard.

Questo per darti l'idea dell'obiettivit dei media comaschi.    Te lo dice uno che  comasco e che non legge l'Unit, visto che dopo qualche mese di lettura di tale quotidiano quando avevo 16-17 anni ne ho fatto carta da camino, come per il Giornale.  Gramsci e Montanelli si stanno rivoltando della tomba.  Ma a parte questo...  E' impossibile fermare la diffusione del materiale pornografico, oltre che improbabile fermarne la domanda. Inoltre dubito che si avranno indagini a tappeto, come per il file sharing: mi sembra un'operazione alquanto superflua e un po' demagogica. Se  una misura per proteggere i minorenni, meglio incentivare le conoscenze dell'informatica in modo che i genitori seguano meglio i figli. Inoltre credo abbia pi senso concentrarsi sulla lotta alla pedopornografia o su problemi dell'industria pornografica riguardanti l'et e le condizioni delle persone coinvolte, la trasmissione di malattie veneree e droghe usata per prolungare le "performances".  Mi sa tanto di ipocrisia: un po' come togliere le case chiuse e mettere le prostitute in strada, per poi lamentarsene.    Poi parliamoci chiaro sull'immagine della donna: il porno sono tette, culi etc. con il preciso intenso di ammazzarsi di pippe. La pubblicit (tv o giornali), il reality etc. sono gli stessi tette e culi, solo un po' pi coperti ma comunque evidenziati, con il fine di attirare l'attenzione e vendere il prodotto, per distrarre "ehi guarda di qui! Le tette!!!!"  Personalmente   pi osceno questo. E' pi osceno il terrorismo mediatico, le armi di distrazione di massa come Studio Aperto.

L'operaio morto sul lavoro muore (per colpa della mancanza di sicurezza, per una fatalit, per un attimo di distrazione) mentre svolge un'attivit con rilevanza personale, mentre un soldato che muore in iraq muore combattendo per un'idea e per una nazione e questo fa la differenza.|`|1EpNQXVlaa	il dato di fatto non cambia, un morto  un morto.  rispetto per i lavoratori e soprattutto tuela per le loro famiglie  ma un soldato, a differenza di un operaio sa di avere un alto tasso di pericolo in zona di operazione e non esiste soldo che possa comprare la propria vita, ma bens quegli ideali che ognuno di noi ha, ogni soldato porta cons il desiderio di vivere bene e cercare di aiutare il prossimo, il fatto che lo stato dia soldi in pi non  certo perche il soldato lo abbia chiesto ma bensi un meccanismo per invogliare  il predetto, sicuramente se non ci fossero soldi l'invio dei soldati avverrebe lo stesso, non so se l'operaio andrebbe a lavorare gratis, questa  la sostanziale differenza il soldato giura fedelt alla patria anche a costo della vita, l'operaio lavora per biisogno familiare.|`|RLbyYu1taa	Sicuramente sono tutti e due morti e la morte come dice il buon Manzoni parifica tutti sullo stesso livello.  Ma un morto in guerra viene ricoperto di lodi perch con il suo mestiere salva altre vite umane, un operaio morto pace all'anima sua non lo fa o meglio non lo fa direttamente.|`|4aefe53e1877640394c1d27922adf0bdaa	Come ha giustamente detto qualcuno, un morto  sempre un morto. Certo il soldato sa che il suo lavoro comporta questo rischio, lo ha accettato fin dall'inizio. Ma non diciamo che  un mercenario. Tutti quelli che lavorano lo fanno per i soldi, cosa c di male? La differenza sta solo nel fatto che l'operaio non dovrebbe morire per incidenti se tutto viene fatto bene e le regole rispettate. Il soldato pu morire per decisione di altri (il nemico insomma) anche se tutte le precauzioni sono state osservate.  Concludo dicendo che come  prevista una indennit per i militari morti in servizio, ci dovrebbe essere un'analoga indennit, magari grazie a forme assicurative, anche per gli operai (o gli impiegati, ecc) deceduti sul lavoro.|`|21b8a650acf7fc55ccfeda5e8a0b7259aa	Caro duch, hai solo 16 anni e vuoi fare gi certi discorsetti?

Portagli pi rispetto hai nostri soldati.   Ma conoscendoti, per te un soldato morto o un'operaio morto, sono la stessa cosa, entrambi lavoravano. Si,lavoravano entrambi, ma con una piccola differenza:  il soldato lavora, per salvare un paese e molto altro,  l'operaio, lavora, e sciopera, e scende in piazza con i no global e insieme a tutti quelli della sinistra, per fare casino e basta.

Certo  che l'operaio, se non lavora in condizioni irregolari o fuori legge, come sempre pi spesso vediamo la cronaca ci dice, non dovrebbe correre certi rischi e le morti dovrebbero essere fatalit, come per tutti gli esseri umani.

shZ4DtfUaa	Ciao amica mia. Posso dirti che sono d'accordo con Alex e Donatella?  Credo davvero che, ti sa vicino a tal punto di aver percepito il tuo stato d'animo e che si sa preso a cuore i tuoi pensieri. Sicuramente ha agito per benevolenza nei tuoi confronti e non per invadenza, vedila in questa maniera. Il solo fatto di aver chiesto ad un altro amico un qualsiasi modo pur di sapere come stavi vuol dire che tiene davvero a te.  L'amicizia  cos strana oggi, delle volte il nostro ego interiore non ci f vedere oltre il nostro desiderio. S che volevi trascorrere un momento della tua vita tra te e te, ma vedi il lato positivo del tuo momentaneo disinteresse per il mondo che ti circonda...il mondo senza di te non ha potuto roteare come sempre,facendo cos in modo di doverti cercare per farlo riprendere come ogni giorno. Delle volte basta una telefonata per ricredere in noi.   Tutti ti vogliamo bene,sappi questo.    Un abbraccio per te.|`|1iCZmWg3aa	Forse forse  stato un tantinello esagerato,per probabilmente questo  dovuto al fatto che conosce la tua situazione non troppo rosea...io direi "cerca di comprenderlo"alla fine era per il tuo bene,a modo suo te lo ha voluto dimostrare...magari la prossima volta non lo far...tranquillizzalo...|`|6Q9EKNmmaa	forse    a dimenticavo lo vuoi il Pampero?|`|L3nt3mZiaa	Non  stato assolutamente corretto, nel mondo di answer anche se reputiamo una persona carissima amica, resta comunque un mondo virtuale e confidare amicizie bhe credo sia giusto restino tali, questa persona ha sbagliato ha fatto sapere al tuo amico che tu vai su internet a parlare delle tue cose e potrebbe farsi di te una opinione diversa da quella che aveva, nel senso che poche persone vedono giusto confiardi in rete poich non si sa se dall'altra parte ci trovi realmente una brava persona, costui non si  comportato da appartenente alle forza dell'ordine  partito in picchiata ed  sbagliato secondo me, ti ha coinvolto quasi obbligata a parlare dei tuoi problemi anche nella realt, magari con un carissimo amico si, ma chissa anche che non vedi o senti da anni, insomma non  stato corretto e se fossi in te lascerei perdere e chiuderei anche perch potrebbe metterti nei pasticci veramente.... non bisogna mai dico mai per nessuno motivo per le forze dell'ordine e per tutti i dipendenti pubblici coinvolgere l'amore e i sentimenti nel proprio lavoro, lui l'ha fatto perch evidentemente prova dei sentimenti per te e non si  reso conto di sbagliare coinvolgendo se stesso per il lavoro addirittura chiamando questo brigadiere, ma stiamo scherzando.... a questo punto se proprio ha tutta questa confidenza bastava che venisse a cercarti a casa aspettare come per legge le 24  48 72 ore e poi chiamava questo tuo amico!!! un abbraccio|`|ULetsZBaaa	secondo me dovresti apprezzare il gesto, anche se un p invadente,  normale che una persona si preoccupi se sei in una fase molto difficile e particolare della tua vita (cm lasci desumere da quanto dici)|`|F99oG3FOaa	uuuuuuuu secondo me avvrebbe dovuto farsi gli affari suoi|`|ed308f5edaa51cebf04eb6f9a9eda6bcaa	Cara Bloom, secondo me dovresti cercare di comprendere ed apprezzare tale evidente preoccupazione.

Abbiamo avuto modo di parlarne gi tra di noi. Quello che ti posso dire  che secondo me dovresti "perdonarlo", nel senso che lui ha agito a fin di bene, per il tuo bene.

Comunque anche da parte mia posso consigliarti di non avere alcun risentimento verso una persona, per di pi un collega, che dimostra cos tanta attenzione verso di te.  Tu sola sai valutare fino a che punto ci si debba interessare dei tuoi problemi, ed il fatto che in questa particolare situazione avessi bisogno di stare un po da sola non deve farti condannare chi non si sia accorto di questo tuo sentimento ora, e ha cercato comunque di offrirti il suo aiuto.  Se non lo hai apprezzato, sia nei metodi che ha avuto nel rintracciarti e sia in ci che poi ha eventualmente fatto, parlane necessariamente con lui per evitare che possa ricapitare, ma non emarginarlo o colpevolizzarlo semplicemente perch non era al corrente del tuo stato d'animo.  Valuta quindi il livello di amicizia che nutri e conseguentemente coinvolgilo pi o meno intensamente nella tua vita, ma parlane apertamente e liberamente e se l'amicizia  sincera sapr capirti, comprenderti ed aiutarti solo quando serve e non solo quando ne ha voglia e soprattutto, conoscendoti meglio, non si spaventer pi.

Il secondo, l'atteggiamento di omissione, sempre distruttivo ma non visibile e quindi non direttamente imputabile.  E pensare, per, che la parte pi distruttiva corrisponde alla seconda, giacch la prima  creata da pochi indivudi che ne trascinano altri.

Tu sei rimasta amareggiata perch gli altri non hanno seguito il tuo stesso scopo, un po come se fossi stata tradita da coloro che pareva fossero motivati come te.  Ma ieri tu hai assistito anche ad un'altra manifestazione del genere umano che  voluta da alcuni per mantenere i propri interessi. Sto parlando dell'ignoranza, quella cosa che divide le persone e non le fa muovere con una sola intenzione ed una sola voce e che tanto paura farebbe a quei pochi che curano solo i propri interessi. Soru, ad esempio, lo ha dimostrato.  Ti ho dato una brevissima panoramica semplicente affinch non faccia la fine di tanti altri, che nel crescere si disilludono e lasciano poi correre le cose.

Grz per l'ascolto alla prossima.|`|gaCQrJkOaa	se la foto che si vede e vera con quelle bombe io ti chiamavo  la squadra artificieri................ un bacio ciao giorgio da Roma|`|51nCV9zNaa	Ciao Bloom;  qualche tempo fa si sono rivolti a noi dei commercianti con il tuo stesso problema. Erano stati contattati da diversi sedicenti enti di polizia quali carabinieri, polizia, vigili del fuoco, polizia sanitaria, del lavoro, della briscola col morto, del tressette senza i tre e della bocciofila in salita... e chi pi ha, pi ne metta... dopo alcuni accertamenti  emerso che, ovviamente nulla avevano a che fare con le organizzazioni di polizia o di soccorso cui dicevano di essere parte, ma altro non erano che societ con fini di lucro, spesso associazioni di categoria non riconosciute, che tentavano la vendita di un abbonamento ad un periodico mensile, con la scusa che i fondi sarebbero andati a sostegno delle forze di poizia o di soccorso (come se non bastassero le tasse dei contribuenti)... Quindi Bloom, quando li ti chiamamo rispndi in modo educato, come sono certo tu faccia, che non ti interessa e se la cosa diventa insistente e fastidiosa minaccia di andare dai Carabinieri perch ti senti molestata telefonicamente... :)    P.S.: se intendi esporre querela ti consiglio farla per molestie telefoniche, pur precisando i motivi della telefonata, lascia al magistrato valutare l'eventuale truffa. Il motivo  semplice, e serve ad evitare che ti querelino loro per calunnia, infatti mentre riusciresti in qualsiasi momento a dimostrare di essere stata contattata telefonicamente grazie ai tabulati del traffico, cosa pi difficile da dimostrare sarebbero invece gli artifizi e raggiri necessari perch il reato di truffa si integri (che comunque in questo caso sarebbe tentata). cos facendo invece tu chiedi che il colpevole venga punito per averti arrecato molestia, il che corrisponde incontrovertibilmente a realt, mentre se il magistrato ne ravviser gli estremi, sar lui ad indagarlo anche per il reato di tentata truffa (tra le atre cose aggravata, per dissimulazione dello status di pubblico ufficiale), che  procedibile d'ufficio.    Ciao a presto...    enfo75|`|wWFhYucaaa	attenta, le fregature sono sempre l, dietro l'angolo!|`|KiJee06Xaa	Bloom e' successo anche a me e mia moglie nel 2003, sono venuti di persona dicendo che avrebbero offerto una protezione in piu, e alternativa ai carab o la pol , erano 2 bifolchi furono arrestati dopo circa 2 ore ( sai al mio paesino ....piuttosto ti diamo le chiavi del negozio ...e gestiscitelo da solo con questi tempi.......che pagare la malavita )   denunciali!!!!!!!!|`|iLksq9scaa	Sicuramente  l' ennesimo tentativo per spillare denaro in modo illecito, millantando conoscenze o appartenenze a corpi e istituzioni, che normalmente non chiedono denaro in questa maniera.

L'unico Media qualificato a trattare le tematiche relative alla prevenzione e repressione di reati connessi in violazione alle leggi sanitarie vigenti  Polizia e Sicurezza Sanitaria che fino dal 1993, anno della sua nascita come Organo Ufficiale di stampa dell'Associazione Nazionale Funzionari Medici della Polizia di Stato, tratta tematiche di interesse generale che spaziano su tutto lo scibile medico e sanitario, col proposito di offrire informazione ed aggiornamento sia agli addetti ai lavori sia a quanti interessati alle tematiche affrontate.    Polizia e Sicurezza Sanitaria  realizzata in collaborazione con l'Unione Nazionale del Personale Ispettivo Sanitario d'Italia che riunisce il personale di vigilanza ed ispezione che svolge le prescritte attivit di prevenzione, verifica e controllo in materia di igiene e sicurezza nelle strutture sanitarie e nei luoghi di vita e di lavoro, di igiene degli alimenti e delle bevande, di inquinamento ambientale, di produzione, trasporto e commercializzazione dei prodotti alimentari, chimici e farmaceutici.    Polizia e Sicurezza Sanitaria vuole continuare a rappresentare nel panorama nazionale un luogo privilegiato di confronto con enti ed istituti sanitari civili e militari, parlamentari, docenti universitari, medici ospedalieri e veterinari, farmacisti, uffici sanitari, enti assistenziali e previdenziali, industrie chimiche ed aziende di settore; abbiamo per questo affidato la selezione del materiale pubblicato ad un qualificato Comitato Scientifico    Voil qui sotto c' riportato l'indirizzo della polizia sanitaria!!!!

5905e98f77879c2f6fe3ed966995972caa	Vai in questura, chiedi come comportarti.  Una segnalazione non guasta mai...prevenire  meglio che rimediare. Innanzitutto le forze dell'ordine hanno accesso ai tabulati telefonici e sanno da dove sia stata fatta la chiamata.  Poi non aver troppi timori: con tutta la gente che c' in giro per Natale non credo che questa persona si esponga per quelli che (permettimi) sono motivi futili come futile  lei.    Ciao e Buone Feste.|`|f155a51d7b9cddd02990cc30ee5ed581aa	si secondo me faresti benissimo ad andare dai carabinieri e sporgere denuncia. racconta come sono andate le cose e poi ti diranno loro cosa fare. per vai a fare denuncia subito!|`|9lYKelkDaa	a me fa piacere perche' nn ti sopporto|`|wGIroZQgaa	Vai ad un commissariato e racconti i fatti in un quello che si chiama tecnicamente "un esposto".  Poi torna a casa tranquilla...   la persona che ha fatto la telefonata aveva un numero coperto ma solo per te...  i gestori quel numero sono obbligati ad averlo e la PS pu richiedere il tabulato del giorno e dell'ora relativo al tuo numero. Non esistono pi telefonate anonime!|`|ug1mDe78aa	vai in questura e fai presnte quanto ti  successo|`|NVNX9Anmaa	Sono pi che sicuro che tu sai benissimo da dove proviene quella telefonata, quindi consiglio una denuncia cautelativa alla Compagnia dei Carabinieri raccontando il fatto e asserendo che nutri forti dubbi che a fare questa telefonata siano  gente senza scrupoli.

Per vai in questura non serve che denunci, parla e chiedi consiglio magari ti diranno cosa fare senza denunciare. La cosa importante  risolvere.|`|8jYjWw5caa	la situazione  molto seria, quindi io ti consiglio di agire con molta cautela.  o si tratta di uno scherzo, evidentemente di pessimo gusto, o si tratta di un caso di scambio d'identit (nel senso che quella storia  successa davvero, e ma hanno sbagliato persona) oppure sono 2 pazzi scatenati che in quello che fanno ci credono davvero.  se ti hanno chiamato al cellulare, anche se la chiamata era da un telefono anonimo, ti consiglio vivamente di chiamare il servizio clienti del tuo gestore telefonico, di raccontargli (senza i dettagli) che hai subito delle minacce e che ti serve il numero del chiamante (per ogni evenienza, nn cancellare la chiamata ricevuta). probabilmente l'operatrice/operatore nn ti dar il numero, a quel punto vai immediatamente al commissariato di polizia e sporgi denuncia contro terzi, fatti mettere il telefono sotto controllo e cerca di nn andare in posti isolati, o cmq la sera tardi, quando  gi buoi, cerca di evitare di camminare da sola.   ad ogni modo cerca di stare molto attenta, ma nn sottovalutare mai la situazione perch i pazzi esistono.  ciao e auguri per questa situazione.|`|cUeeAA4maa	E' necessario presentare, presso un Comando dell'Arma o Ufficio della Polizia di Stato, una denuncia ove sia indicata con la massima precisione possibile la descrizione delle molestie e i giorni e gli orari in cui sono state ricevute.  L'art. 127 del D.Lgs. 196/2003 "Codice in materia di protezione dei dati personali" ha introdotto la possibilit, per il titolare di un utenza telefonica che riceva chiamate di disturbo, di richiedere che il gestore telefonico:   renda temporaneamente inefficace la soppressione della presentazione dell'identificazione della linea chiamante;  conservi i dati relativi alla provenienza della chiamata ricevuta.  L'inefficacia della soppressione pu essere disposta per i soli orari durante i quali si verificano le chiamate di disturbo e per un periodo non superiore a quindici giorni.La richiesta deve essere formulata per iscritto dalla persona che riceve chiamate di disturbo e, nel caso in cui sia preceduta da una richiesta telefonica,  inoltrata entro quarantotto ore. I dati conservati in accoglimento della richiesta possono essere comunicati al richiedente che dichiari di utilizzarli per esclusive finalit di tutela rispetto a chiamate di disturbo.Pertanto prima di attivare l'A.G.  sempre opportuno presentare la predetta richiesta al gestore telefonico per acquisire in proprio i dati relativi alla provenienza della chiamata di disturbo, sui quali potranno basarsi gli eventuali successivi atti di indagine.  Ma non credo che una sola telefonata possa essere considerata molestia. Chiedi consiglio al Carabiniere di quartiere.  ciao    PS: la denuncia cautelativa esiste solo in ambito assicurativo|`|dew6Rtcaaa	denuncia cautelativa e anche subito! Comunque sicuramente in questura sapranno consigliarti. Dovrebbero mettere sotto controllo il tuo telefono, le telefonate anche anonime sono sempre rintracciabili, e vedrai che tutto andr per il meglio.  Al limite ti consiglieranno in questura; oppure, gruppo di amici cattivissimi e il problema si risolve alla radice.|`|ffXhXzAsaa	Cara, ho avuto esperienze di questo tipo e ne ho visto vivere da altri.  E per quanto non sia mai certo, ma secondo come hai descritto la cosa mi sembrano persone abbastanza "innoque".  Sai perch? Perch se  vero che vengono da "una certa zona", ed hanno parlato in un certo modo, ed hanno minacciato... beh, quelli che fanno veramente paura non fanno tutto questo: agiscono e basta, sperando di fare il male che vogliono.  Questi sono pi per le minacce, che poi si spengono come nulla.  Quindi, per quanto questo non ti tranquillizzer, probabilmente, ti servir comunque per farti un'idea della cosa.  Tu, se vuoi, dai pure la tua bella denuncia cautelativa contro ignoti (sempre che i Carabinieri ti diano retta).  Per il resto, organizzati in modo di non essere mai troppo sola, specialmente quando esci dal negozio la sera, almeno per un breve periodo di alcune settimane.  Ma ho una quasi profonda convinzione che tutto sia un "fuoco di paglia".  Ciao e in bocca a lupo.|`|f0f35c5b3abfd9eac09de8dcd6872709aa	Ciao Bloom...mi dispiace che al mondo esistano ancora tali imbecilli!    qualche mese fa ho ricevuto una telefonata identica! completamente identica. l'unica differenza  che i ruoli del ragazzo e della ragazza erano invertiti.    il mio interlocutore era un ragazzo e sapeva tutto di me:  - nome, cognome  - et  - aspetto fisico (disse anche: che sei massiccio non mi metti paura)  - macchina e targa della macchina    nella telefonata disse che:    - frequentavo per motivi di forza maggiore lo stesso posto XXX che frequentava la sua ragazza  - molti testimoni (non sapevo di essere cos conosciuto) mi avevano visto parlare in atteggiamenti intimi con lei e che lei stessa gli aveva dato il mio numero;  - le credeva ciecamente;  - non mi dovevo far pi vedere in XXX (ci dovevo andare per forza, guarda un p tu il caso);  - non dovevo pi parlare con la sua ragazza;  - mi avrebbe tagliato questo, squarciato quell'altro, ecc...(e descrisse nei minimi dettagli come sarebbe avvenuto l' "agguato"....roba da ridere);  - proveniva da un quartiere X notoriamente malfamato;  - aveva amici usciti di galera che non ci avrebbero pensato due volte a farmi a pezzi.    durante tutta la conversazione in sottofondo si sentiva la voce di quella cretina che doveva essere la ragazza e diceva: si  lui...io ti giuro che non ci volevo parlare ma lui ci ha provato, ecc.....    roba che in quel periodo ero anche findanzato. per di pi l'unica ragazza che ho conosciuto in vita mia che si chiamava come diceva era una mia compagna delle scuole medie che non sento e non vedo da 8 anni.    non mi impression per niente. ero certo che fosse uno scherzo. gli dissi: vediamoci nello stesso posto XXX (manco a farlo apposta frequentatissimo) tale giorno a tale ora.  non si  presentato nessuno, ovviamente!    comunque, siccome sei una donna (e in generale pi vulnerabile di un ragazzo), parla con i carabinieri di quartiere.    come ti ha gi detto qualcuno: un tizio che corrisponde a come si  descritto questo cretino agisce senza parlare.    Ciaoooo.|`|7EutKGlOaa	Metti al corrente qualcuno della situazione....puoi eventualmente far denuncia, volendo anche da anonimo si ritrova il numero del mittente dai tabulati a cui loro possono accedere....Se  uno scherzo tutto si risolver (ma io non gliela farei passare comunque liscia) altrimenti meglio che chi deve sapere sappia della situazione...meglio prevenire|`|g5o75QSPaa	Una denuncia a scopo cautelativo puoi farla, risolvi meno di niente per se vuoi puoi farti mettere sotto controllo il telefono, una mia vicina di casa lo fece.

Certamente ci vorr del tempo per fare i dovuti accertamenti, ma se dovessero succedere episodi simili o concretizzarsi le minaccie, si saprebbe quasi subito chi andare a cercare.  in bocca al lupo.

Ricordo pertanto il Giudice bambino , Rocco Livatino , i  famosissimi e sempre nei mio cuore , Giovanni Falcone e Paolo Borsellino , il loro amico responsabile della mobile Nini Cassar i suoi subalterni ed  in particolare quelli morti nelle stragi di Capaci e di via D'Amelio , il giudice Imposimato , il Giudice Pio la Torre , mi scuso infine per tutti gli altri giudici che ora non ricordo ma che non ho dimenticato che sicuramente , avendo anche loro sacrificato la loro vita all'altare delle istituzioni , continuerano ad avere un posto speciale nel mio cuore e nei miei ricordi , avendo vissuto in prima persona tali avvenimenti ed essendone rimasto sconviolto per la gravit e la violentissima sequenza degli avvenimenti.  Come si f a non reagire ad uno sproposito del genere , come si fa a continuare a rimanere affascinati da un soggetto del genere e soprattutto come si fa credegli.  Ieri, come tutti i giorni ero in treno , strapieno come sempre e come sempre in piedi in piattaforma con una ventina di persone e l'aria che mancava.  Sar stato per questo forse che ad un certo , sapete come vanno le cose , sicuramente per passare il tempo , incomincio a discorrere con due studentesse universitarie.  Non ci crederete ma secondo loro i problemi dell'Italia   erano dovuti esclusivamente agli ultimi due ani di Governo Prodi e malgrado io avessi diversamente argomentato portato ad esempio quello che hanno detto tutti ed in particolar modo dati e cifre , nonch esperienze dirette sulla lotta all'evasione e mercato del lavoro , hanno preferito rimanere in silenzio e non discutere , garbatamente pi , dicendo che loro avevano le idee chiare e che dopo la laurea ,. loro sicuramente avrebbero trovato lavoro .  A quel punto io ho concluso facendo loro i miei  migliori auguri per  un futuro radioso ma ho anche raccomandato di cercarsi , vista la situazione ,  un santo in paradiso .  E' incredibile come un essere , non so definirlo pi esattamente , quella cosa , piaccia ai giovani e li abbia talmente plagiati ancor pi dell'on Fini che indubbiamente  un ottimo oratore ed un abile politico.  E'incredibile  come per la battuta in  tv del problema del precariato dove unica soluzione sembrava quella per una ragazza precaria di sposare un milionario , magari uno dei figli del Berlusconi e cosa ancora pi sconcertante l'affermazione di non vo,ersi candidare nelle liste del PDL a Roma ma di voler votare Silvio alle prossime elezioni.

a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	That is not an entirely accurate question.  I know a lot of black people who are republican.  I know a lot of white people who are democrat.    Some people prefer democrats over republicans because democrats usually support public programs that give money to people who do not want to have to work for it.  This allows government to control most aspects of their life (Global Warming Hoax and the repercussions of that is one example).    The military also suffers during a democratic controlled oval office and congress.  Compare Carter to Reagan, Bush to Clinton, then back to Bush.  Under Reagan and both Bush's the military expanded and was able to defend our country.  Under Carter, my Brother was in the Marine Corps.  They were using antiquated weapons and howitzers from the Korean War.  Under Clinton, we had base closures and a reduction in force that nearly went to the level of malfeasance.    Remember Bosnia?  Pres. Clinton said we'd only be there a year.  Here it is 12 years later and we still have some troops there.  No one brings that up though.|`|L9LkdThjaa	Happy Me- Obama is far more white than black.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	They don't pay attention to history?

Even if its 5-10 dollar a week or month, thats not much, you can get that just by selling some stuff or doing odd jobs round the neighborhood or something, but attempt to work it out with them, this will help YOU in the long run. They cannot sue you if you are activily TRYING to pay them|`|3yrpDNavaa	Sure they can.  Just because you have no job, no property, and no car now, doesn't mean you will not have any of those in five, ten, fifteen years from now.  Once the creditor receives a judgment from a court, that judgment can potentially be enforced indefinitely.  As soon as you find a job, and the creditor knows, your wages can be garnished.    Note that statutes of limitation apply to debts.  So, if this law firm's suit against you was filed beyong the statute of limitations period for your state, then you may argue that fact in court in your defense.

Io non faccio parte di uno schieramento, voto dove penso che sia giusto votare, ma se vedo che Berlusconi fa cose sbagliate, ne parlo male.  Tu sei uno di quelli che qualsiasi cosa fa Berlusconi, obbedisce come uno schiavo, o hai ancora un cervello per decidere?    p.s:  vedo che ti hanno MASSACRATO anche gli altri...  peggiore domanda di questa non potevi fare, mi sa.  ma non  che sei un p masochista, e ti piace essere maltrattato?    p.s.2:  i pochi che hanno risposto a tuo favore, come al solito nei filoberlusconiani, hanno risposto sempre in maniera molto ESSENZIALE e decelebrata. ma possibile che non sapete mettere due parole sensate una in filo all'altra? Ma allora  vero che a destra ormai votano solo gli stolti?  Ecco le vostre risposte: "comunisti di merda!", "terroni comunisti", evviva berlusconi, prodi mortadella", "noi c' l'abbiamo duro e voi no", "berlusconi non ha fatto niente di male! (anche se non sapete cosa a fatto)"  ......  ma quando vi svegliate? cosa aspettate ad iniziare ad informarvi? vi stanno solo sfruttando per fare i loro interessi, non lo capite?  non avete visto che da oggi  aumentata il PANE, la PASTA, la BENZINA, e che l'inflazione  hai massimi livelli degli ultimi 12 ANNI!!!!  e l'unica cosa che fa il governo  la legge SALVAPREMIER...  e voi ancora a dire "ma berlusconi ci vuole bene...."    vorrei crederlo anch'io.....mi si strappa il cuore a pensare che chi ci governa, non si interessa dei nostri problemi......ma fino ad ora le prove vanno tutte contro di lui.....ed  una cosa davvero triste, sapete?    x murdok: alla fine sei stato pure divertente con la battuta sul pdl / pd, seriamente.  ma   1) io non sono comunista  2) beppe grillo non  comunista  3) potresti dire 1000 cose dici? ma non hai provato a dirne nemmeno una, il che mi fa pensare che fai parte di quella schiera di persone che non ragiona e dice. "sia lodato Silvio"  mi sa che tu vivi fuori dalla realta, ma non te lo dico per offenderti.

Hai idea del fatto che in Italia barche "a vela" di quelle dimensioni ce ne sono pochine (Berlusca a parte che ha un megayacht sia vela che motore di 48 metri, ma si sa pi sei piccolo pi compri cose grandi)? U ciccio, fai cos, posta la foto del veliero con Fassino sopra, cos se ne pu parlare, oppure astieniti dal dire minchiate please.   (forse ti confondi con D'Alema che ha una bella barca grande, ma  solo 18 metri poverinooo)  Gi che ci sei, chiedo a te e tutti i servi di Silvio presenti:  potreste postare la foto del vostro dio sulla barca insieme a suo delfino Dell'Utri, condannato in primo grado a 9 anni di reclusione per concorso esterno in associazione mafiosa?   Per quanto riguarda Grillo credo ti abbiano gi massacrato abbastanza, ma se sei un millantatore senza cultura non  colpa nostra. Un altro favore, ti ricordi nel 2003 quando Fassino rinunci all'immunit parlamentare per affrontare il procedimento per calunnia, da cui fu prosciolto il 30 gennaio 2004, e sfid l'allora presidente del consiglio, Berlusconi, a fare lo stesso e ad affrontare i suoi processi? Mi dici com' andata a finire?  Un'ultima cosa, guarda che tu non puoi dire una str(+)onzata e poi il giorno dopo smentirti come fa il tuo dio, qua le cose che dici andrebbero documentate.

Treviso: venti benestanti evasori totali  Uno aveva trasferito 500 mila euro all'estero, altri avevano barche da capogiro e numerosi appartamenti     TREVISO - Il fisco, questo sconosciuto. C' chi non vuole affatto pagare meno tasse, ma non perch le tasse siano ?bellissime?, come disse l'ex ministro dell'Economia Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, ma per il semplice motivo che non le paga proprio. In provincia di Treviso la Guardia di finanza ha scovato venti persone totalmente sconosciuti al fisco: cio che non avevano mai pagato un euro di imposta.    EVASIONE - Per possedevano barche da 600 mila euro, terreni, auto di lusso, appartamenti e ville. I militari delle Fiamme gialle di Treviso hanno approfondito la situazione patrimoniale di 111 persone che avevano acquistato tra il 2004 e il 2007 imbarcazioni il cui valore era superiore ai 100 mila euro. Nei controlli sono emersi movimenti di capitale in Italia e con l'estero di aperture di societ, e di propriet di immobili e di auto di lusso. Dei 111 controllati, venti erano sconosciuti al fisco: di questi undici hanno dichiarato un valore pari a zero euro, 14 invece quelli che posseggono da due a undici appartamenti, ma c' anche chi  risultato proprietario di 50 immobili a fronte di una dichiarazione dei redditi di poco superiore ai 5 mila euro annui. Tra le verifiche  infine emersa la posizione di una persona che ha trasferito all'estero oltre 500 mila euro per motivi non commerciali, mentre, per il fisco italiano, risulta essere, da sempre, un evasore totale.  21 giugno 2008       L'Italia  diventata una schifezza. Rubare  normale, non farsi processare  normale, votare chi ruba  normale, far star zitti i pochi giornalisti fuori dal coro  normale.   Ci mancava adesso che pagare regolarmente le tasse e acquistare legalmente un bene fosse da comunista.  Ragazzo, non so quanti anni tu abbia, ma  "comunista" mi ci fanno diventare se voglio un Paese onesto.

I strongly disagree with his belief that the Government can and should fix all the ills of the country.    While giving a man a fish when he is hungry sounds nice, in the long run unless you give a man the incentive to fish for his own dinner and the skills need to do so he becomes dependent on the Government for the fish and never wants to learn how to get his own. Why work when you can get it for free?     This is the Obama idea, give them the fish. You can come to your own conclusion as to the result of this belief system.    This is the only reason I do not like his policies. His race has absolutely nothing to do with anything.     One other reason, the Democrats are going to tax us to death.

What it's all about is the employees who have to put up with the second-hand smoke and the government says they shouldn't have to. My solution: Look for employees who all smoke, hang a shingle that says "this is a smoking Establishment" and everyone is happy.

Anche se fosse mi spieghi perch continui a parlare di Berlusconi e del suo passato.A che pro.La campagna elettorale  finita.Ti hanno detto che al governo ora c' la sinistra e che il nostro nuovo premier  ROMANO PRODI.  Non te la prendere ma spreca le tue energie per documentarti su quello che sta o non sta facendo questo governo.Documentarsi non sui siti o sui mezzi di informazione.Comprati la gazzetta ufficiale e studia le leggi che hanno approvato.Poi secondo tua coscienza morale al di l di un partito o un colore fatti questa domanda: e' buona come legge,serve al mio paese, chi ci guadagna,contro chi va e sempre secondo coscienza tua morale decidi senza influenze alcune se  una legge giusta o no.    Questo  fare politica.Documentarsi sulle leggi approvate e su chi le ha fatte.Dopodich valuti quale schieramento appoggiare.  Devi trovare cosa stanno facendo per quegli operai che dici tu.  Tasse governative, regionali, provinciali, irpef, iva, ici, tasse di possesso (bollo auto ecc.ecc.), inps, 8x1000, tfr, ticket sanitari, pi tutte le tasse comunali che quasi tutti i comuni si inventeranno per i tagli avuti.Aumento spazzatura,mezzi pubblici, parcheggi,grattini per strisce blu aumentati del 120% ecc.ecc.  Che dici lasciamo a fine mese ad un operaio o ad un dipendente d'azienda qualcosa per ....................... MANGIARE.  Pi tasse fai pagare e pi l'evasione fiscale aumenta.  DIminuendo le tasse la gente per non rischiare paga.  Si tratta di economia.Vedi altri Paesi.  Ho sentito gente dire no ma  giusto perch il nostro paese deve rispettare i parametri europei..... perch il PIL deve arrivare......  Ma che C A Z Z O se ne fotte un operaio che guadagna 1000 euro del PIL dei parametri di Maastricht.Ma stiamo scherzando?  Qua si deve fare qualcosa per aumentare i salari,per far scendere i prezzi ecc..ecc Che IPOCRISIA.    Dovete prendere il vizio di non dire per sentito dire o perch trovate qualcosa su dei siti.  Dovete informarvi sulle leggi che fa questo o quel governo sulla gazzetta ufficiale e secondo vostra coscienza morale dire se  giusta o sbagliata per voi e per i vostri cari.  Spero che tu non la prenda a male come fanno in molti che si infervorano.

ae975a0266c9557e6a44815f8fa1cf35aa	You forgot the Coast Guard.|`|AA12020119	depends on what you mean by training? Each have their pluses and minus', and there are so many different ones.    Army Special Forces ( before you get to their training you have already gone through Airborne and Ranger training.. Navy seals?    If you are talking about basic it is probably the Marines as theirs is longer, that is when you don't count Army Advanced Infantry Training!    Few people get into the Seals or the US Special Forces!    There are these: United States Army Special Forces   Underwater Demolition Team   United States Special Operations Command   United States Special Operations Forces   U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance   Red Cell   Air Force Air Commandos   Delta Force   Special Air Service   Special Boat Service   Frogman   Mark V SOC   Operation Anaconda   Canadian Special Forces Canada's JTF2   Z Special Unit   United States Navy Special warfare   United States Navy SEALs in fiction   DEVGRU.    The Seals may be the hardest, but they all have different missions to accomplish so it is hard to rate them.|`|Te8QZScKaa	I think that the Marines and the Navy Seals are the hardest to pass because they are the elite troops of the united States|`|E98BsiWHaa	Navy Seals.....Although the Marine Green Berets come close|`|e4644fd054c65854325113e11579d1e1aa	Obviously the US Navy SEALS - their training is physically, emotionally, psychologically and in all other means mentally exhausting.   (USMC Force Recon, US Army Rangers and Green Berets, USAF Para-Rescue are right there with the SEALS in all categories, but I've spoken to Recon Marines that say that SEAL training is the toughest - high praise coming from that bunch). But with the others, it depends on the individual, and what you mean by hardest.  If you mean most physically demanding, cleary the USMC and the Army; and they are virtually the same.  If you mean most intellectually demanding, then the Navy and Air Force (again virtually the same).  If you mean which one demands the most from you militarily, then it's the Marine Corps - all discipline and polish.|`|AA10968176	I think it is unfair to group special force groups like the Seals with regular military branches.     The Seals are awesone, without question. But, they are a special group with a special purpose. Only a select few are even given the chance to try to become one.    With that said, I think you have to ask this question about the groups that anyone could decide to join. Everyone has the same chance to join the Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, and the Coast Guard. Out of those, the Marines by far has the most difficult training. Twelve weeks just for boot camp...    Just my opinion.|`|KmTX0MCKaa	If you mean Basic Training, then Marines.    If you mean the hardest training in the Military, that would be the Army SF and although nobody knows what it's like, I would imagine Delta Force has the hardest training of any branch. Though Delta Force is a multi-branch thing taken from SF, SEALS, RAngers, etc. it's under Army Command.    So, overall Hardest:  Army    Hardest for the average soldier:  Marines    The SEALS are not a branch of the military. They are part of the Navy. So, their basic training would be for Navy. Their training doesn't even come close to matching SF training.|`|AA11525325	Green Berets are in the Army.

But I believe the Green Beret can no longer see that location over his shoulder.|`|MH1MDzrRaa	as far as basic training, marines no doubt....the army doest even yell at the privates anymore..the navy and airforce are said to be a cake walk by everyone ive talked to and your not a marine until after boot camp graduation...|`|NpJPuehfaa	navy seals.... but the marines are very close... its not just physically demanding, but also mentally as well... but if u are strong minded, you should get through it with no problem    PFC Starling USMC
6aSXs0vOaa	i wish i had the answer|`|575cb6b1cf5b6852adb2d2d72dec74dcaa	A term made up by people who do not understand ethics or morality.  A term made up by people who  do not understand what Peace is.  Their ideas of peace boils down to nothing more than, How big is my piece and how long will my piece last.    If you want to take a good look a a fine example of how we have evolved to this degradation into terms like global politics, take an objective point of view without bias toward any one side of any given issue at the point of discovery of the Americas and onwards in time till the present.   You will notice first came the explorers, then the traders and finally the soldiers.  From exploration to soldiers, there was something that broke down.  This same process has been used time and again in each step taken.  About a thousand years ago, Lief Erickson didn't have near the troubles that the last 5-600 years can show you.  This is the blueprint for humanity from my point of view.  We carry blueprint wherever we go in the world.  And global politics is nothing more than a debate on how to gloss it over.

bdaff1aefd0fc9f0124cfd06758eb166aa	    You don't come across as intelligent by the way you posted your question which leads me to believe that you are lying. You have misspelled words. Some of your sentences do not flow properly. If you are as wealthy as you claim I doubt very highly that you would be wasting your time in this forum. People that have any class and truly have money don't find it appropriate or necessary to make an attempt to brag about it. So good luck I hope you are able to obtain the wealth one day that you claim to have.    |`|K8Ca1sU3aa	I hope you don't honestly think the Obamabots care about you.

Right now, you all should just be "American".|`|5Xg2TuQDaa	Because they are BOTH at fault|`|g4Dxlklxaa	There are reasons for this debt on BOTH sides.     However, from my perspective, Democrats put it all on Republicans saying they're evil and selfish, then Republicans start citing history and try to convince Dems that it's not one sided. Typical to Dems, they ignore history and continue to point fingers and resort to name calling. Very sad we can't have REAL debates and REAL growth.|`|cWmx0J4jaa	The reason they argue is to how to spend the "stimulus" money. If the Dems srted it, then a bunch of tax cuts should get us back in order.    If the Repubs did it, we may need bigger gov't.  Personally, I think we need smaller gov't and tax cuts would generate a ton of new jobs. But, it all depends on how you think we got here and how we can escape really....|`|AA10317675	Because they are politicians!  That is what they do.  Point the finger at the other side.

He's waaay better than that.. As he points out often on his show..    Remember when he was offended because a caller accused him of "Only making 5 million dollars a year"? Yep..|`|52cGZS3caa	President Obama doesn't feel "threatened" by the likes of "Joe the Plumber" or "Rush Limbaugh". And, neither of them are "ordinary people", they have brought celebrity upon themselves with their nasty, racists rants and the President gives them what they are due - nothing (I'm not really sure why "Joe" is even mentioned) . btw: a man that has done what President Obama has done doesn't have any "need" to make himself "feel" bigger. In case you haven't noticed, he is the leader of the greatest super power on the face of the Earth!|`|4bb9634fc5a91b36fafd38e3fba80eecaa	look's like the insecure one is the one asking the question,you see , do you not,  that the regular folks are always insecure, fearfull, they do the fighting for the ones that pretend to do the fighting, and your last eight years proove it , they told you to go spend money, even if you have none, Bush told us this in 2002, read please, low interest rate, fill the credit card, he said, now 6 years later , your out of your house, your supporting a great war though, are your not,  it was a property grab back now, because now the more wealty can buy up some of those property, and others from all over the world, we got burned, and so we bomb , not nowing what we are hitting, family's, to fight crimnal groups,  you study them , you send small military groups when you are very shur, after the cia has been fully used, patience does not seem to be something we know nothing about, Greenspan,  everybody's favorite, dropped the interest in 2002, perfect for Bush,  and we went for it like fish to water, buy material goods quik, they say,|`|RD05jXYwaa	he is a socialists and as such he has no real power.   only the ordinary citizen has real power.   he is afraid of what he cannot control.   he must beat or destroy what he can not control.  tmm|`|bXl12I4Baa	No. his not is afraid from Americans? He is afraid from the republican politician. All republicans do not like him, because the big combines do not have any brakes on the taxes like bush use to give them. They may kill the man, like f. Kennedy. That is my warring at the present time. Mr. Obama is a very rare good president and it will try to help stray ting this country. Republicans lost the gold they had from bush and they are all lost. Did you see the Exxon gas co.? Last year 45.2 billions profits and all others in this country went to a hell?
XfhkQwKIaa	Apparently not. This speaks volumes of Obama's character or lack thereof. Daschle will get a pass just like the Treasury Secretary. I am seriously considering refusing to pay any more taxes until there is some intergrity in our tax system.|`|LqBIKJbcaa	it's a good way to round 'em all up.|`|Fyq5nK4waa	If the Republicans tried this we would be crucified.  Obama does it and he is the great one.      Since the President of the United States has no problem with his people not paying taxes, maybe Obama will be fair and eliminate taxes for us working stiffs.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Only if you are a republican.|`|9RXS67Mmaa	It's alright, they just "overlooked" the fact that they hadn't paid their taxes.    Overlooked, my rear end!    These folks do not believe in leading by example. It's not "do as I do", it'd "do as I say to do".|`|9hGIaDBkaa	liberals always assume the rules only apply to other people|`|LCqL6Z2laa	It's a perfect example of the corruption of Obama's administration.    Obama does nothing about this - this is "change" we can count on.|`|y37YQnpXaa	The democrats are just showing us that they can get away with anything.|`|hdcLCk8Faa	Sure it is a bad example, but when you are a Dem., character and lawlessness does not matter--or so they think.     Not only tax cheats but now lobbyists are OK, when Obama said there would be NO lobbyists in his administration. Lie   181 in his first 11 days.|`|gsKfSkJ1aa	" This administration will be the most ethical and transparent of all administrations" - Obama    ROFLMAO! What a joke    I remember when Clinton promised the same thing!|`|0eFcXyZ6aa	Yes, if the people of the united states would all claim exempt for one year and then refuse to pay maybe we could get away with it too,|`|VK0brk89aa	Where these tax evaders apart of Bill Clinton's OLD Staff?    Obama is keeping up with the Democrat Tradition...... LOL  All   losers.    If Obama had experience he wouldn't of had to hire them, he would have confidence in himself and hired others to do the job.

No.    Disgusted?  You bet.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Fear? Hardly. Laughable that anyone sees him as a credible source. Absolutely.|`|1amF7oNwaa	HE EXPOSES THEM FOR WHAT THEY REALLY ARE|`|0JL3Mg78aa	- Rush Limbaugh is obviously back on the illegal drugs again--he is a ranter with no purpose other than to scream about people he doesn't like.     - There are MANY conservatives who are better than Limbaugh, and more coherent.     - Those on the left are not scared of Limbaugh, they are disgusted with him, as are many on the right.|`|MoidAgwuaa	I know why I'm scared of him.     One time I snuck into his yard and peeked through his window. See, I used to have a huge crush on him. I watched him come home and start getting undressed. He took off his clothes, which was really sexy, but then... he unzipped HIS SKIN!!! He is a scabby purple alien-cyborg hybrid creature under there who smells like a diaper full of burned hair and baby food. Let's just say, my crush ended, and he still haunts my dreams...|`|c4b57b3534465ec39ec8b5c38862f872aa	Not frighten just annoyed.  Actually if you can listen to him he is actually amusing.  He would have been taken off the air long ago, if he had not been entertaining.  My problem is I take politics far to serious, His brand of nonsense just doesn't fit my style of political humor.|`|Oq8G5Cvlaa	They should embrace him because he is Truly an idiot!   One reason there is no bi partisanship!|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	Why do Republicans always assume that when you think someone is crazy as a loon, they are scared?  We aren't scared of Rush, or that other person, Palin, that we are supposed to be scared of at all.  If anything its Republicans who have a Chicken Little outlook on life.  You guys are scared to death of anything your grandparents wouldn't recognize.  Get over it, grow up, we have seen what you left us, if you weren't scared of that then don't expect us to be scared of a blowhard and a female blowhard.    There are intelligent, rational humans in the Republican party, why aren't they heard from with the same degree of intensity that the fringe element is heard from, some sanity would be a good idea about now.|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	We aren't afraid of him in the least. Obama has Limbaugh right where he wants him. Obama is holding the bait in his hands, and Limbaugh is walking right into Obama's hands. By the time Obama springs the trap, it will be too late for Limbaugh and all the Republicans who decided to bet everything that the stimulus would fail.|`|AA10690306	Afraid of Rush?  What are you smoking because He would want some of that.  Rush Limbaugh is a joke even among the Republicans.  His drug habit has taken his credibility long ago.  I mean he was convicted of having his maid get his Oxycontin illegally by a Republican prosecutor.|`|5Ys3GvpFaa	Because they know that if Rush gets his way, even more of the punks libs will get this trreatment:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CZu6nRRs...    This video shows how to play "baseball" with a punk lib.|`|LkR86Eb1aa	Limbaugh is the counter-balance to the pin-heads on the View.|`|12m9145haa	Uh definitely not scared. We just think he's a fool....and those who follow a fool.........|`|tAej7qsqaa	I find it funny that most people who dislike him has never even listened to him before.|`|QMzsM2fkaa	I'm not scared of that loudmouthed fat drug addict.|`|AA11086243	he's a good propagandist...     they are to be feared...
MIafHnKDaa	nope...he'd be hawaiin ...duh:P lol|`|iZA2KVjkaa	YA!|`|N9VN9bwfaa	It depends.  In the South in the U.S., most people consider a person Black if that person has any Black ancestry.  In one of my sociology classes, a student mentioned having one grandparent who was Black out of four grandparents.  She was no darker than I am and I have no Black grandparents.  Her hair was not any curlier than mine and no darker either.  But she had been tormented in school by other children who called her filthy names and treated badly otherwise because other people considered her Black.  Elsewhere, where people didn't know of her ancestry, she could have "passed" for White.  But Obama could not because his skin color is somewhat darker and his hair is curlier.  He is actually halfway between those rather silly classifications but in this country we make a big deal about this sort of thing.  That's a shame, but that's the way it is.  If we lived in Brazil, where there are more different classifications, he'd be called something other than the Portuguese word for "black" (which is "moreno").  In South Africa he'd get the middle classification, which would be an old-fashioned term no longer used in this country.  We don't have a middle term any more.  But when I was a child we did.  I think we ought to throw out all those classifications altogether and just say "Americans" but nobody listens to me.|`|AA10811674	Sure he would. I'm not the president and I still am white.|`|AA12021966	Obviously. What job you have doesn't change your race.|`|8FO52r0Maa	he's not even all black, let's not forget that he is 50% white|`|qOqm6j2Saa	Yes but next time he would run for President as a white guy|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	He was black before he was President, and he will still be black when he is no longer President. So what's the question?|`|wOcTPbf7aa	If he wasn't in politics at all he'd be white.|`|7pf2pGBUaa	yes, but us republicans would still be crying about liberals
e43b6e42489365436493bb48c6bb0ce2aa	If Palin is the best the GOP can muster, then they are in more trouble than ever!!|`|lU7jWzEJaa	I can tell that Palin is a woman.  That's more than I can say about Billary Clinton and Pelosi.|`|7mOfekBWaa	The republicans elected their first black national party chairman. I also hear that Louisiana guy Bobby Jindal being talked about. Though after Obama these moves seem a little...well desperate really. "If you can't beat him, join him" sort of thing. It's like they're saying "look we can elect minorities too!"|`|JKbvnwcDaa	Um...it's only been a few months since the Presidential election, which means that the next one won't be for four whole years...It is way to early to tell. Pretty funny how things change though, I mean before obama, there had only been one Democrat in office in the last 30 years.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	two words. RON PAUL.|`|zftm6qkKaa	LOL, how true. Believe it or not, Sarah and I were once married. On our wedding night I woke to the horse sounds she was making.     I turned on the light and said, "What the hell are you doing?" She said, "My daddy said that a man likes a lady in the day and a horse at night."    I said no sweetheart, I'm sure your daddy said that a man likes a lady in the day and a whore at night.    She said, "No, I'm sure he said horse." I just rolled over and let her continue with the horsey sounds.|`|YIWKPXokaa	Yes!      Dems for Palin 2012!|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yes, she is a great american.

AA10925759	Right where I live there have been a couple of idiot criminals.     One guy held up a bank and had the tellers fill up a bag from a video rental place. In the process the receipt for the movies fell out. The police went to the store, identified you he was and caught him at home counting the money.    These guys (one of which I knew from going to a bar) robbed a convenience store because they were depressed about having no money for Christmas. They robbed the place and locked them in the walk in refrigerator. So it being Christmas eve (they felt bad about it)they called the cops from their home phone and informed the police that there had been a robbery and that they needed to let the people out. Of course the police have caller ID.     My favorite one is one I saw on TV recently. This guy robbed this corner store but also stuffed a ton of snacks on him and in a bag and took off running. Turned out he lived really close by. They caught him because all the police had to do was follow the trail of snacks he dropped all of the way to his front door.|`|AA11124254	Yes... Absolutely.
q4EXFhV7aa	NO!! She ABSOLUTELY does NOT need YOUR numbers, ONLY her Drivers license. Further, if this person has stolen and used her cards, she needs to check her credit reports (all 3 of them) and make sure nothing was purchased in her name. If they use her credit card, they might use her SSN for more credit, work id, etc. She can dispute these items if she finds them, but she still doesn't need YOUR info to do so.|`|AA10671142	call the social security office and talk to them and tell them what happen. don't wait a.s.a.p. I don't know why she would need your social security number. I never heard that before. also she should call all the credit cards and tell them they her cards where taken and they are using them.|`|1UDDfDi6aa	Tell her to go steal someone else's social security card.  The fugutive is her new boyfriend and you or she have/has a serious problem.|`|0jmVA50Jaa	Simple.    Report the stolen card to your local Social Security Office.   Then ask for a new card/number.    Do it soon.
a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	It greatly depends on the crime they're accused of and if I really thought turning them over would change anything for the better, but on general principals, no. I've been on it in my past. Nobody turned me in.I was wanted for possession of drugs...personal use only. I got that taken care of a long time ago, but wasn't turned over by anyone. Shows you how little the police actually have to do in a large city, huh?  The reward they were offering for me? $25..hardly worth ruining a friendship over. But some of these clowns would rat their own mother for a buck or the supposed notoriety.|`|GbLmBcIoaa	If the family member or friend had committed a crime, even a bad one, but was no longer a danger to anyone, then No, I'd never report him.  I would still encourage him to right whatever wrongs he committed as best he was able.|`|gqoIfbH0aa	I'd report him or her.    I believe in justice and I would definitely report a friend, a friend is someone you can trust and obviously I cannot trust a murder/rapist/whatever got him on the top 10 faces in Crime Watch.    My family would be tougher, if it was an aunt or uncle I'd probably do it since it's just ethically correct, it would weigh on my mind heavily if they repeated that crime again and I had done nothing.    But if it was my mother or my sister... God forbid, I may try to help them.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	No.|`|btVNM1Djaa	if it meant getting a reward, sure|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	So your saying that if they were wanted for rape of child or murder you would assist them to flee?|`|IW8ryPjdaa	**** NO!!|`|HIn1p4OBaa	i wouldn't. not even if the reward is like a million bucks.|`|ec7704ff57fb3a8ea43c41b63bc84935aa	it depends what he/she had done, shop lifting no. anything else yes.|`|xzEPg0afaa	actually i wuz on americas most wanted and i got away|`|N63LMH5Qaa	i would help them|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	In a heartbeat.  As they would do to me.|`|R534McNOaa	Only if the REWARD MONEY was enough to take a sunny holiday!|`|RRFbDou9aa	Heck yeah; that would likely be a hefty reward. They're going to get caught some day anyway; might as well cash in on it.|`|0115b8162e3b4d1bdce5ffb45890b1d8aa	Friend yes. Family I would advise him strongly to go and see the police with a lawyer if need be in fact I would take him and then if he/she did not within 24 hours I'd regretfully shop him. He is either involved or not involved, If not he will have nothing to fear if involved  he will need the legal protections allowed in law. In both cases I would have many sleepless nights     Different treatment double thinking?  Yes! Blood is thicker than water family comes first but civic duties must be carried out. However if he belted Gordon Brown I would help him escape|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	I would turn him in as they could bring down the whole family or group of friends. Crime is wrong so any way we can stop it happening is a good thing.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	depends what they've done|`|AA11248279	Depends how much the reward is.|`|bQmMNG5vaa	If they are in the top 10 they must have done something quite serious so I would stick them in, I wouldn't want to end up in jail for helping them flee, with bubba sticking it in me.
di43MlSFaa	Yes, they must go through the swearing in process for a second time retaking oath of office and they do give a second Inaugural address to the public. They do have a traditional parade, but the size of festivities after the official Inauguration obligations are completed varies.|`|AA12021966	Yes. For any term that ends (ie. a 2 or 4-year term), an inauguration has to be held.|`|IWwM3Edbaa	he will be assassinated first|`|d8fBi1aNaa	Hell, he he couldn't do it the first time...oh, I mean wouldn't.|`|7c534f903b0e2ce66b61181c5752ace8aa	Yes, if any President gets reelected for a second term they will have to be inaurated again on January 20th at 12PM...    It has always been that way.. Recently, George Bush did his second inaugural speech..    It's interesting to see how much being President seems to age you..|`|fLH4ILzbaa	Yes, and if Obama gets re-elected, expect him to break his own record with the cost.|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Yes they do.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	Yes they will.|`|Wcjc8Au1aa	Yes, they have an inauguration after every election.  One of the most famous speeches in American history was Lincoln's speech at his second inauguration.

In WI, they don't ask for proof of insurance when they pull you over.  But in Illinois, if you don't have it and they pull you over, it is a driving without insurance ticket.  And that can be a lot more expensive than the monthly payment for auto insurance.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	You get a ticket for no insurance and they send it in to the DMV who will then suspend your drivers license for not carrying insurance.|`|R534McNOaa	If your a Guy they throw you in Jail but if your a girlie you get an invite out!|`|c07v7O80aa	Minimum - citation and probably suspension and requirement to show proof of some long term paid up insurance. Some places are towing for no insurance, either because it's expressly addressed in state law or because it can be done anyway, since you aren't legal to drive away in it without insurance.
73193e3b067ba4736d1fab4da3289625aa	I doubt you will get your money back but I would have your parent approach the lady and tell her you did not have permission to buy the bearded dragon and that she wants the money refunded. She wants not you...you should stay out of it from now on. I think she will say tough but if it was me I would give it back. Then again I would not have taken money from a child anyway which makes me think you wont see it again. She knows you aren't going to take her to court for $100 so I am afraid you have lost your money. But have one of your parents try to bluff it out of her...cant hurt to try. Oh and by the way bearded dragons are an Australian animal that has been smuggled illegally out of Australia where ALL of our animals are protected by law. We are not allowed to keep native animals unless we have a permit. So you people who think it is cute to buy bearded dragons or sugar gliders etc should think twice about supporting the importation of our native animals illegally. Sorry about the rant but it is important to know where these animals come from and not support the people who illegally obtain them from smugglers.
AA10690306	I don't know about having someone killed but I do know (and have read the documentation on) of at least 74 Americans that disagreed with the Republicans and "Disappeared" into the legal system for up to a year without being charged or being implicated in any crime.

With that analogy in place, it looks like the RNC is just putting a black guy there to steal some of that thunder. Your disparaging and overtly retarded remarks aside, it's rather pathetic to see a repeat act done so quickly after the first show. Nothing against Steele, but you can't help but think that this party that was- for all intents and purposes- owned in the past election is trying to revive itself by going for the charity vote.    Republicans only got 4% of the black vote this past election. To nominate a black man for chairman just screams "look we can be black too!"|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	What do you mean . . I am thoroughly enjoying the fact that white  Republicans were forced by circumstances to pick the one black man in their party to lead them . . .lol . . lol . . good luck!!|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I'm sorry, but I just find the actions of the Repubs hilarious. They are so desperate to claim back some of America with their transparent actions. Hillary was doing so great in the presidential race, so they dug up Palin - hey look folks it's a woman ! - well that sure backfired in their faces, duh, should have done yer homework first. Obama wins the presidency - hey look folks we got us a black man as head of the RNC !! It's just too funny. Never in a million years would this guy have gotten this position otherwise. Look at the Repub party and you see tons of old -white- men with stale rhetoric and policies that don't work for most Americans. Now they are scrambling to cling on to something they gave away due to their narrow minds and greedy ways. HA! too late suckers and sore losers.|`|Lc6o6w8Maa	Heres another question Why are republicans such sore losers? You had your chance in office and your party failed.|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	It's the pot calling the kettle black... on both sides.    However, I will point out that being called "token" is not nearly as offensive as being called a terrorist or a muslim because of one's mixed heritage...|`|wOcTPbf7aa	Because you can debunk any liberal argument and win every time if you debate well, so they decide to bring up pointless dumb arguments to get some support.|`|EULVtVDvaa	THANK YOU !!! I was thinking the same thing . I'm a Republican and proud that Michael Steele is head of the RNC ... oh and I'm white the horrors !|`|6Ch7vbKfaa	They always have and seem to always will act hyprocritical.  so much for "change"... nothing has changed.  It has gotten worse.|`|AA10317675	I am getting sick of the "oreo" comments!    Racism exists on both sides.  I personally know bigots - some who are Republican - some Democrat.|`|651a651e9e9b67965456fb9edd123aafaa	Well.. I've never called him "token" or made general statements about racism.. I think Steele is qualified for the position.. What I will point out, is that I think it's a little odd that Steele has soooo many supporters all of a sudden.. Nobody was talking about this guy 5 months ago..    I thought this part of an article I read was kind of funny...     "But the 168-member RNC clearly signaled it wanted a change after eight years of Bush largely dictating its every move as the party's standard-bearer.?"    Sound familiar to you?|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	because it is like this, Republicans said they were making history by nominating a woman as VP, Democrats did this 20 years ago. Republicans seem to have an agenda behind every move, they have a facade they are trying to build and it isn't working.|`|52cGZS3caa	Way to go Margie! Tell it like it is! I just LOVE it. Sounds like you are one of the very few adults here.|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	It's only an issue with them when it's convenient...which is, well, ALL THE TIME. When you imitate your leaders, and those leaders are masters of hypocrisy, this is what you get.|`|BHeBSGemaa	I think that you're making things up in your head. Less experience than a McDonald's manager? LOL come on now you can come up with something better than that. Also, I didn't see any dems crying racism when repubs elected steele.|`|fRCoMzXkaa	Experienced and qualified? Obama was a US Senator and had spent years in the Illinois State Legislature, if I recall correctly, Steele was a Lt. Governor (not a powerful position if you're not aware) and he failed in his bid for a Senate seat (by double digits).     Turnabout is fair play. If Republicans thought it was hilarious to call Obama an "Affirmative Action President" and attribute his election to "White Guilt" they should have known they'd get cackles.|`|vPPbV72Naa	You're generalizing dude.|`|tAej7qsqaa	I agree, it's just another case of double standard.|`|930cba9d43942421245e19d5d6f49bb4aa	cause the last leader of the Republican party didn't like black people....remember Kanye live?....remember Katrina?|`|jRXQ6kgCaa	Who's being hypocritical? We just think it's ironic that you got your arses kicked, then immediately put a black man in charge, when all the while Republicans have never done a DAMN thing for blacks! TOKEN! What's next, black shoe polish on your faces? Even McCain tried to be like Obama when he started to lose! Your affiliation is a JOKE!!|`|Yhxc1gs7aa	Don't get your panties in a wad there tinkerbell, wooper's right you are an irrelevant loser.
CZlUhRfkaa	Each state is different.  In Texas, your license plate will show us the vehicle VIN number, year of expiration on your registration, make of car and type (suv, car, etc), registered owner's name and address and who the lein is with if there is one.  Sometimes it shows the prior owner.  From that information we can usually then find whether or not insurance is carried and by whom and the expiration date.  From all of that we can run the registered owner and see if there is any local history and provided we can find a date of birth, we can find out any history on the registered owner such as driving history, criminal history, etc.|`|m5J36D28aa	If your mindset is to mislead the police, you're going to lose.|`|1vCoaf08aa	However much is on the car's profile.    They get so much info from your license plate.|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Not much, you would be surprised how behind in technology some public agencies are.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	If he runs the license plate before he pulls you over, all he'll get is information about who the car is registered to (name, age, address, prior record), and if it's been reported stolen.   If the driver isn't the registered owner, he has to run their license to check for a prior record.  You're supposed to have your license on you when driving.  If you don't, there's no way for him to know why you don't and he will probably cite you for driving without a license.  He can check the name you give him, but without a picture ID, he has no way of knowing if you're lying about who you are.|`|c07v7O80aa	Drivers licenses can be run for any state from any state. That doesn't mean they must accept that the name and date of birth or the number you give is actually you. Probably will, if it matches up with registration and your insurance card. If suspicious, No DL is arrestable, which allows plenty of time to work out who you are.|`|93M8Vccvaa	Registered owner of the vehicle and if there are any wants on the vehicle,ie. stolen or wanted in suspicious behavior. That's about all the computer will say because all they have to go by is LP on the vehicle.|`|n7u9i3xfaa	If you didn't have your liscence at the time, you would be in some trouble, believe me my sister got caught with out hers. My aunt was a cop before her death so I know a bit about this from her notes from university. Even if they had the information that you have a liscence, they would still ask you to show it. If you didn't have it I'm pretty sure that they would ticket you.|`|meMikD5maa	ve He would know  were you live  weather you have  or the vehicle have Had any tickets or you are a delinquent almost everything except  if  you are the owner  of this vehicle as far  as  your  license you would only  get  a warning  for  not  having it     :-)|`|qwaWd14vaa	Depends upon how much input to the computer s/he had before s/he pulled you over.  Usually the stop is for an offense or regular road check for registration, seat belts etc..  Why we ask for a license to see a match up.
spbqfjvbaa	You outprocess (which includes TAP , medical, dental, TA-50 turn in, & everything else for outprocessing), during which time you get your DD 214.  Make sure you get some extra copies notaries by JAG on post & keep your extra copies.  You'll need them for your VA Loan, GI Bill, & other Veterans Benefits, as well as proof of your service for civilian employment.    You will get your DD 214 before you go on terminal leave.  I did this when I ETSed from Camp Yongsan, Korea.  I was on terminal leave for 77 days & came back to the states to start back into college during that time.|`|AA10420446	When you time is up  you will get your DD214. Always Always keep it. make 1000 copies because when you look for a job get a new job or house loan . they like to see it.|`|V5AdMbgqaa	I seem to recall that you get it with your "walking papers" . . . after it's been signed by all.  I may be wrong but, I think that's how it goes down. It's been a while. :)  If you use benefits in the future, you will have to send for a certified copy. It's just TOO fun.  The copy you get at departure is just a copy . . . I think.  Good luck. :)    Yes! definitely what the guy above me said!|`|ubrYk78waa	You should get it along with your orders home.

a2rjzPYZaa	OMG 60-69!  Truth be told JFK was a better president after he got shot...no joke, it made him legendary instead of a mediocre president. His stint as pres didn't accomplish much. He cut taxes & wanted war with Cuba. He had a drug addiction, extra marital affairs, made a grave mistake with the Bay of Pigs debockle & got the US involved with Vietnam. People get caught up in the grief of losing a popular president, who really wasn't any better than average. Ask them to name JFK accomplishments & you'll know they bought into his mystique when they come up with nothing.  No real strategy; it was his youth, smile, lack of a 5 o'clock shadow & all the Kennedy bootlegging cash made during prohibition.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	What are you talking about? 1950-59 would have been the fifties.|`|fKFvzlzQaa	The 1960s were the decade 1960 to 1969.    I consider John Kennedy to have been a very good President.    The strategies that John Kennedy used to get votes were essentially large amounts of money from his wealthy father.|`|tDZMJue9aa	should be 60-69 those are the 60's and i dont know if it was so much he was a great president as it was that the country was fascinated by him and his family, and that was before he was shot, so when he was shot it made him this huge martyr yet he couldnt keep his pants up has this really odd family with this odd tragedy or jinx and i dont know what he did to get them to vote for him i wasnt alive|`|mBlcD6sRaa	60s mean from 1960 - 1969|`|AA11288277	I think they are actually referring to the 1960's.  I have however noticed that when people are talking about the 1960's the idea that they have in their head is really more like the early 1970's...big bell bottoms, "peace signs" and everyone getting stoned.    Kennedy was a much better president after he was shot.  Here's the thing Kennedy is being remembered more for his charisma than his ability (kind of the way a former junkie romances the drug).  He did set some things in motion, but never lived to see them through (the space race and the civil rights legislation come to mind).  Kennedy inspired the youth to turn out and vote, and the Catholics felt it was their duty.  In fact 98% of registered Catholic voters turned out and voted for Kennedy.|`|8aXimsjBaa	1960-69|`|ofP7bbX7aa	The public library has the answers.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	60s of course.

And yes, the majority of the country thought he was a good President. And it was definitely before he got shot.|`|4lINNvG5aa	Oh man!  I can't remember the '60s dude.|`|JhD0X6PLaa	the '60s. the 1950-59 was the 50s.   I wasn't alive for Kennedy's presidency, but from what I've heard from my family and learned in school he was a pretty good president, not super unbelievablely spectacular as the legacy he left behind would seem to indicate. he did some great things (moon landing) and as someone else said the nation was fascinated by him and his family, and there is a tendency to lionize him posthumously because he was asassinated. However lets not forget that he was the man who began to take us into Vietnam.|`|8TLEjhqaaa	1960-1969.  he was charasmatic and handsome.  haha.  um, he kind of representated change.  he wanted to go in and get rid of corruption.|`|yGXKYptjaa	The 60-70 time.  Although in the arly 60s the 'drug revolution" hadn't taken over the country and the Federal government hadn't started busing everyone around against their wishes.  It was funny that not one race wanted to be bused, so the Feds made it mandatory.  During the early 60s young people used to do as told and be more moral, then the drugs and the hippie movement and the "we're not going to take it" crowd against authority started.  All races were clean cut before then.  Have a much older cousin that went to Woodstock and "whoopie", not me. He ended up as a producer of about six different popular tv shows, but was from Mississippi and not a hippie when he grew up and could still ride horses and rope cows and fight cattle rustlers (but we used a nude VW to chase them).  Well nixon and Kennedy had a hard fought race and for some reason it took longer, they say for the votes to be counted in Chicago and thus say it was rigged by the Daley machine.  Most liked him and he was a Kennedy, complete media blitz like now.  Back in those days people took stuff like that serious and you didn't have the comics making fun.    It was a close race and history states that he was more photogenic than Nixon, young, Camelot and war hero.  Although they say he would have been courtmarshalled at he was not to have taken the boat out and it cost lives, but his dad had money.  Interesting read.  Without the drugs things would have changed but not as bad as they are today, remove drugs crime drops 70%.  Have a great 2009, 2010,..By the way are you in public school as I don't understand about what you mean when are the sixties, the 50s or the 60s.|`|SjTAVdcKaa	Mmmhmmm & the 21st century did not really start until 2001.    Generally, the "60's" refers to the latter half of decade when rock music, drugs & the anti-Vietnam War protests took center stage.    Kennedy, who's good looks & TV persona gave him a leg up, had won the presidency by a narrow margin, particularly in the Chicago, Ill region which his opponent, Richard Nixon - Ike's VP & a superb foreign strategist even then, could easily have contested, but didn't to spare the country the ignominy of a court battle for the presidency (Gore, you listening?).    Kennedy was a mediocre president with less than two years in office before the assassination. A couple of things stand out. He appointed his brother, Bobby, attorney general (can you say nepotism?) and reneged on a promised to help Cubans who invaded Cuba with his assurances of air support, which never came. They were slaughtered on the beach in the "Bay of Pigs".  Surprisingly, he did lower taxes tho'.    But the press, sensing a good myth-in-the-making, strove to create an American royalty which troubles us to this day.|`|AA11388462	1960 through 1969  I don't know, I was 16 when he was shot|`|OqctF1H3aa	the 60's means:1961, 1962,1963,1964,1965,1966,1967,1968, and 1969
AA11163314	Obama is saying what is popular.      This sort of thing sounds good even if it is really stupid policy.

If the registration is suspended over 6 months then the vehilce can also be towed.    If you have wrong registration tabs on your vehicle it can also be towed.  22651(o)(1)(b) and 22651(o)(1)(c).     The 22651 section of the Vehilce Code is the "Tow Authority" section.  This states when and why a vehicle can be towed.    Also, if ur vehicle is parked on public parking lot or a private parking lot where public has access to park (i.e. grocery store parking lot) and you dont pay a fee to park there (like a parking garage) then your vehilce can also be towed there if your registration is expired over 6 months.    Does this help?

25DwuEYlaa	Illegal Immigrant Gangs Commit Most U.S. Crime   Criminal street gangsmostly comprised of illegal immigrantsare responsible for the majority of violent crimes in the United States and are the primary distributors of most illicit drugs.    The alarming, but not surprising, information is revealed in a new report published by the Justice Departments National Gang Intelligence Center (NGIC), an FBI task force created in 2005 to curb the growing threat of violent gangs in the U.S. The NGIC teams up with state and local law enforcement agencies throughout the nation to enforce, study and intercept gangs and has published several reports documenting their activities.     The agencys latest publication has not been made public but a national newspaper revealed some of its findings this week. It says that up to 80% of crime in the U.S. is committed by gangs and that gang membership in this country has grown to 1 million, an increase of 200,000 in the last few years.     Additionally, gangs are the "primary retail-level distributors of most illicit drugs" in the U.S. and several are sophisticated enough to compete with major Mexican drug-trafficking cartels. Most of the countrys state and local enforcement agencies have reported gang activity in their jurisdiction and the problem will only get worse, according to the FBI.    In fact, a high-ranking FBI director said gangs have followed the migration paths of illegal alien laborers to avoid big-city police departments that have cracked down on their activities. An example is the notoriously violent Salvadoran gang known as Mara Salvatrucha or MS-13, which has spread throughout the U.S.to at least 42 statesand continues expanding.     In 2008 alone MS-13 members, all illegal immigrants with previous criminal records, committed atrocious crimes that received ample media coverage. In San Francisco an MS-13 gang banger murdered a father and son with an assault weapon because their car blocked his from making a turn. In Los Angeles an MS-13 member just released from prison murdered a high school football star as the teen jock walked home from the mall. In Maryland a 14-year-old honors high school student was shot to death on a crowded public bus by a Salvadoran illegal alien who proudly revealed he belonged to the MS-13.|`|UWL7Ncqtaa	my biggest concern and the one that has affected me personally is the plight of undocumented students who were brought here by their parents and are virtually in limbo upon graduating high school. i would like to see the DREAM act  reintroduced into congress and passed or at least some opportunities for them to change their status. going back home and attempting to enter legally is not a plausible and realistic option for these kids. we need to stop making crimes inheritable, these kids didn't choose this.|`|9LW97VxLaa	UK immigration is very bad, as it doesnt allow genuine student to play their part.

While I am studying in Uk for last 2 years and as 20 hours are allowed to work I just got part time job in vocation and holidays and when I apply for extention they give me 10 or 11 months visa and then I need to pay 300 visa fees and some administration chrges to my college to apply again. 300 is a huge amont for genuine student as I am just investing my family wealth not earning like other, but they just dont care they are blind.|`|AA11161283	Frankly, if you don't put in the time to read a book on free trade economics, which includes labor, then you shouldn't write on immigration at all.    According to free trade economics, free migration for the whole world would lead to the highest productivity, which in turn leads to higher wages and social spending yet you find far less educated people turning what economists say upside down by claiming the exact opposite here at Yahoo Answers.  Hmmmmmmmm?    The simplest way to understand free trade is to extrapolate.  For the sake of argument, lets say labor migration restrictions are good for the economy.  Okay, then lets have more of the them.  You could stop all labor from crossing state lines, then stop all labor from changing cities.  You could even stop labor from crossing bridges within cities.  Obviously, the more restrictions there are the more you approach the point of absurdity.     This proves that if trade/labor migration restrictions are bad nationally, then they are bad internationally as well.    Japan has no immigration, so to live in Japan, your parents must have had sex in Japan.  Is that really an economic rational just to simply have most of the world stuck where they are born.   Also, we live in a world where most  people are not considered good enough to immigrate, yet the same people are good enough to have 10 kids each.  What kind of contradiction is that?    The people here have never explained the rational for restricting labor from crossing the U.S./Canada border.  Most Canadians and Americans are indistinguishable, and it's just by a flook of history that the two counties are even separated at all.  It's absurd.|`|IMENWksEaa	The extreme unfair and foolish way that families are split up. It simply does no good for no one, and achieves nothing worthwhile, while creating even more problems for society and for those who are minors, citizen or resident family members. I have known individuals who have a good work record, good references, tax payers, married to a U.S. citizen after becoming a permanent resident. Some have children, and who's paperwork either expired, and they were trying to renew it, or something they had ran out before they could get the other paperwork finished, and they were deported. The spouses in both of these cases have to travel back and forth while working and caring for the children here. Children deserve both of their parents, and marriage partners should be together, it is a crime to separate families- parents/spouses forced into abandonment, and also a moral wrong. Also the information on a citizenship test at interview; all those details that most lifelong citizens don't know, are expected to be memorized almost perfectly by someone who is nervous about the outcome of their case, is really something done in a very unfair way. I have read somewhere that whether or not a person passes or not could depend on the interviewer themselves. They could be tricky or calculating enough to state a question that wasn't even in the study for the test, that they are pretty sure the person cannot answer.    * Deportation should only be for non citizen gang members, or those involved in violent crimes, sex offenders, thieves, drug dealers,drunkards with multiple DUI s, hit and run, etc, this is different . However, people who are working, paying taxes, taking care of their families, committing no crimes or immoral behavior could be allowed time to file their paperwork. They have to save money, it's at least $ 600.00 now, and is going up, to file for citizenship. The permanent residency, that comes first, has also become very expensive.  Edit * Wouldn't it be a lesson for the thumbs down on this one to think about if your family was one of those who were unfairly split up ? Unless you are 100% native American Indian, then you came from immigrants too. :)|`|WBwlKbLeaa	I have a huge issue with ILLEGAL immigrants, cant stand them and their mooching ways.

W had a DUI and more:      "THE HILL IS RETAKEN BY SMOKERS  By NINA BURLEIGH/WASHINGTON Monday, Aug. 21, 1995  Dick Armey and Republican Conference chairman John Boehner puff cigarettes, and House majority whip Tom DeLay often sports a wad of tobacco inside his lower lip.      When Democrats ran the house, the health and environment subcommittee office was a no-smoking preserve ruled by anti- tobacco crusader Representative Henry Waxman. Today the subcommittee is part of the domain of Republican Thomas Bliley Jr., a pipe lover who hails from the tobacco state of Virginia. Smoking is now accepted in the old subcommittee room, and congressional aides gleefully flick their ashes into a glass ashtray placed atop Waxman's picture."    "Bush flatly refused to answer questions related to cocaine, though he was eager to talk about the redemption that led him to quit alcohol at age 40."     "The Republican candidate for president acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that he was arrested for driving under the influence on Labor Day weekend in 1976, near his family home in Kennebunkport, Maine.     According to Canadas Criminal Code, Bush is deemed an inadmissible person, in violation of Section 19 (2) (a.1) of the Immigration Act of Canada.

CowgOqXTaa	As a general rule, until you purge the contempt - ie until you agree to go to court.    In the Federal system, and in some State courts, there is a limit - but it is long. 18 months in Federal courts, two years in CA courts for example.    Richard|`|j4CaE6zSaa	Civil contempt, a murky legal concept. Some scholars say it is too often abused by judges, to the detriment of those charged and their due-process rights.     In some contexts, the federal system limits civil-contempt confinement to 18 months. Some states have similar limits. But in other states, judges face few restrictions on how long someone can be held in civil contempt.    A judge generally can issue either a civil or criminal contempt charge whenever he or she feels that a party has disobeyed an order or has disrupted a proceeding.    In a criminal contempt charge, which is aimed at punishing bad behavior, a defendant is afforded the due-process safeguards of the criminal system, including a possible jury trial.    Civil contempt charges, on the other hand, are meant to be coercive, issued to force behavior such as making a witness testify, compelling a journalist to reveal sources or strong-arming a parent into paying child support. Because civil "contemnors" hold the key to their own freedom -- after all, complying will spring them -- they aren't given the same due-process rights as criminal defendants.    If someone held for civil contempt can't meet the judge's order, theoretically, the confinement should end. And while long-term civil confinements are unusual, problems arise when a court doesn't believe the person. With the party and judge at loggerheads over, say, the availability of funds, it is often the contemnor who loses, forced to remain behind bars at the mercy of a skeptical judge.|`|zAHeKvE1aa	You can be held in jail until your case comes to trial if the judge decides to do so.

The way I see it, she has at least one felony and one misdemeanor charge. The felony is pergury, because that form she signed for the police report is an affidavent (don't know if I spelled that correctly.) She knowingly gave false information on aform that clearly states that she has to tell the truth under penalties of purgury.

As such we should make other nations reciprocate with our labor and environmental laws. If they do not comply then we should refuse to import their goods.     This is a moral as well as an ethical issue. Many American companies would find that it would be easier to just stay here and hire Americans for the job.

Don't know much about the way things work do you!|`|qCmrtQe4aa	Interesting. I know that your question said, not the economy. But, here is a unique issue that I feel could be addressed. With the Market becoming unstable, and Obama even saying on his platform that we need to bring together Main Street( middle class)and Wall Street( top 5%). Recently,Bernard Madoff was found accountable in possibly the largest Ponzi scheme. He tricked investors out of $50 Billion dollars. He is presently under "house arrest" in his mulitimillion dollar penthouse. Ironically...... he is Wall Street. If a middle class person, stole a $20 dollar item from Target, they go directly to jail. How does Main Street meet Wall Street? Rules should be across the board. In his first day of office, he made adjustments on all senior members income. There would be no raises. He was making a statement by this move. He should make rules apply to Wall Street that apply to Main Street. Show the American people that what is good for one, is good for all. There is accountability. That would go along with his thoughts on restoring America's faith in America's government. Because it isn't one set of rules for upper class, one for everyone else. Best of luck. And if that doesn't work, go with health care. Discuss Hillary's previous work while Clinton was in office to make changes to children's healthcare reform. Maybe with her on staff, she can help further that initiative. Health care is necessary. Yet, Americans especially during this economic downturn, have to prioritize bills, and sometimes full cost doctor visits and expensive medicines are not in that budget. My grandmother almost died because she wouldn't turn up the heat and became severely ill. She couldn't afford it. She couldn't afford the doctor for her illness or her medicaitons.

Whats sad is that if your kids school receives any federal funding then the government requires them to provide the contact info that lets the recruiter find your children.    We told the recruiter that our children had ancestors in every war since the French and Indian wars, that I had a total of 21 years and retired as a Master Sergeant and that my husband has a disability from Desert Storm.  We said that we thought that might be enough for now and didn't see the point in our kids pumping up Haliburton's stock.|`|a884be02bfc60eb1130e1960c9c7b3cbaa	Tell them they're gay AND wet the bed still or just change your number. i know it stinks they can do anything to drag you kids off to phony wars, huh?|`|2wyDALHgaa	Have them join up and do their bit for your country.  Once the kids are signed up you won't hear again from a recruiter.  Guaranteed.  It'll work every time.|`|pwdv08hVaa	kids? 18 is an adult, or is your head to far up your *** for you to realize that?|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	Maam, I'm a Navy Recruiter. I receive school lists from the high school that I call. High Schools provide these lists in compliance with the No Child Left Behind Act. I also use a system that send me information of students that submit there information to military.com and other military websites. We also receive info from scholarship websites when people ask for information on ROTC scholarships. In this system it allows me to make notes. If a parent or a child says they are not interested and not to call I annotate that into my system and I just don't call anymore.    We are just doing our jobs. I just ask that you please not be rude to the recruiters. Its a tough, frustrating job and that just makes our day worse.  :)   I know you are probably going to really hate recruiters after I say this but sometimes we keep calling people that are extremely rude just to get on their nerves and make our day a little brighter by making someones elses a little miserable.    If you have problems with recruiters that won't stop calling just ask to speak with their supervisor and explain to him that the calls won't stop and you would like them to. Tell them you don't feel the military is an option you would like them to take.    There ya go secrets from a recruiter.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	Well...try unplugging your phone...but then again they'll just meet face to face when they go to school. Haha.    All in all if they want to join they'll join whether it's with your support or not. Kids aren't the only ones who join up.     If you really want them to stop calling tell them that you aren't going to allow your child to join and they'll drop it.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	you are sad if they asked them to call then you are not going to keep them from calling they are asking for them and its sad that you dont' want them fighting for our country. we have defended this country since the beginning of time and if we dont' we'll lose it so why be so mean. we all have to go one way other  and the fact they want to go is not of your business in some states now 17 is considered adult.|`|006d3fb083d9c813ff6736eb9009149caa	Yeah, when I turned 18 a lot of army, etc. stuff was mailed to my house and such.

Otherwise, let your kids tell them that THEY (not you) aren't interested instead of trying to control them after they are old enough to make their own decisions.  Better to have a recruiter call you so you can say no than to have a draft board send you a letter that you have no option to say no to.    Besides, most seniors have no idea what kind of benefits the military offers.  It is the job of a recruiter to give them that information.|`|SRT5rMSHaa	tell them to get out of your face and say NO!!!!!|`|AGQI3NuXaa	Use your brain. Here is how it works. Your kid will ( yes, they will) be given a sheet of paper from his/her school with instructions.    "If you do not wish for your child's name to be given to military recruiters within the area, sign this and return it"    Simple as that. If you can't follow directions deal with it.     Id be more worried about sex offenders calling my child ( if I had one) than a Service member. It is important for your child to investigate their options, maybe they want to serve. Don't be a stuck up leech, people need to man our military, why not your child? "Too good" for that??|`|s1ZxSkQiaa	Shouldn't that be your kids decision? Not to be rude but you can't force your children not to serve if they want to.     I understand it is frustrating to have something you don't like around you but if your children don't want to join that is all they have to tell the recruiter.     My parents don't like the military either however since I joined I have shown them a lot positive aspects of the Army.      If they don't want to join then have them tell the recruiter as such. However at least allow them (your children) to have the conversation.|`|6qxWQDBdaa	Get rich or work with the government|`|u6EJnaVpaa	Threaten them with friendly fire|`|KQL3tqS7aa	Tell them that your children are simply not interested.

Tell whoever is calling to quit calling them or you'll file a harassment complaint against them.     My b/f did this to them and it worked.

I had to do that because they wouldn't leave me alone. I even told them that I had health problems and they could care less.      They can't take no for an answer just one time, tell them about it.|`|d744df703c1bbfc38519fcf12e361265aa	When they call, they're just doing their job.

My mom finally saw it, and started signing it my Junior year, and they never called our house again.|`|KxxSxznLaa	Politely ask them to stop calling.  Also make sure that your kids aren't calling them.  My recruiter claimed that he got in trouble by a  parent who was upset that he kept calling his kid.

L9PpiE42aa	I think you handled it well.  If it should happen again, you should ever so nicely remind you boss that it's too heavy and you could possibly be injured should you lift it by yourself.  Labor laws don't specify anything about a legal amount you can be required to lift, unless there is a specific amount included in your job description. However, Workman's compensation does required that the employer provide any assistance or assistive device necessary for you to do your job safely.|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Most states are a right to work state this means that if you cannot do what your job describes the employer can let you go.  Although some OSHA regulations are in place to protect you, you might have a hard time defending yourself.  If the drive shaft was more than 50lbs you might have an argument but your best option is to find an independent lawyer who practices in employment law.  Chances are that the employer was wrong to do what they did to you but you have to prove it and at best you will get some lost wages back and a bad reputation unless you get a good lawyer.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	What could it possibly wieght? 60 pounds tops!

Had you been injured, your employer, under worker's compensation, would have had to pay all of your medical bills, time off work compensation, and compensate you for any permanent disability.    Obviously, preventing an injury is always the BEST choice - you did the right thing.  Contact OSHA  and let them advise you.

70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	There are two reasons for the wife gaining temporary custody at this time, from what I can gather from your details.    The first being, the court views accusations of any child abuse a much more serious matter than accusations of cheating.    Secondly, the ex-wife had witness testimony to the abuse.    If your father wishes to continue his fight, he may in fact need another attorney if he's dissatisfied with the one he has, and he's going to have to come up with some witnesses of his own to counter the accusations of child abuse.    The court can only rule on the evidence presented, that's just the way it goes. If your father can accomplish this, they will most likely share custody of your half sister in the end.|`|AA11124254	Get another attorney if you think that the attorney is wrong.  This is too complicated of an issue to be answered on here unless a family law attorney answers the question, ignore any advice except get a new attorney.

My question to the audience is..."  Pardon me, but I do think that your questions should be directed to your father, especially because you are concerned and your father is only telling you a thimble full.  And that "thimble-full" is not rational because of this question: "How or why would a rational man rely on one whom he considers an idiot to represent him in a most serious matter?"  The only rational answer to that would be either "that he does not really want to prevail or he does not want to share the truth, the whole truth, with you and would rather just glibly assign fault to the attorney."  Justice Cardoza stated: "An intelligent person intends the natural consequences of his actions."  If your father relies on an idiot for representation, then he intends the natural consequences of that idiot's representation.  If you want to help, and your father wants to prevail,sit truthfully with him and don't let him shrug it off, and go with him (why weren't you in Court to testify in your father's behalf?) and secure representation of a very good and very respected attorney.  Then all of you plan and execute.

Where a request is not specific and focused, Department staff will assist the requester in identifying the requested information, describing the technology or physical location of the record, and providing suggestions of how to overcome practical barriers to disclosure. The operational functions of the Department, its facilities, institutions and offices will not be suspended to permit inspection of records during periods in which such records are reasonably required by Department personnel in the performance of their duties. If the request requires review of numerous records, a mutually agreeable time will be established for the inspection of the records.   Should be directed to the office, division, branch, or section of the Department which created and has ownership responsibility for the desired records and be clearly identified as a public records request. If the requestor does not know which component is responsible for the desired records, the request for inspection should be directed to the Correspondence Control Unit in Sacramento for routing to the appropriate official.   Should sufficiently describe records so that identification, location and retrieval of the records can be achieved by Department personnel.   Is encouraged to be made in writing unless the request involves records which are maintained by the Department for the purpose of immediate public inspection and should be clearly identified as a request for public records.   The Department may refuse to disclose any records which are exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act. (See e.g., Gov. Code,  6254 and 6255.)   Physical inspection of the records shall be permitted within the Department's offices, institutions or facilities and under the conditions determined by the Department. Upon either the completion of the inspection or the oral request of Department personnel, the person conducting the inspection shall relinquish physical possession of the records. Persons inspecting Department records shall not destroy, mutilate, deface, alter, or remove any such records from the Department. The Department reserves the right to have departmental personnel present during the inspection of records in order to prevent the loss or destruction of records.   Upon any request for a copy of records, other than records the Department has determined to be exempt from disclosure under the Public Records Act, Department personnel shall provide copies of the records to any person upon payment of a fee (12 cents per page) covering costs of duplication.   A copy of these guidelines shall be posted in a conspicuous public place in each office, institution and facility of the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, and a copy thereof shall be made available free of charge to any person requesting such copy.

Uaci5YXWaa	Sort of.  You will get a tax credit.  So if you are due a refund, yours will be higher and if you owe no tax, you will get $500 back anyway.|`|30ad4662919fe0039d27aaea1639ebe5aa	Yes, Stimulus,One like Bush got|`|kOsJ63KFaa	No, that was Bush's plan that everybody hated him for. How dare he put extra cash in the hands of people who payed there taxes. Obama thinks he can do a better job of spending it than you can. But its for your own good! Don't you trust him?  I sure the hell don't. because I read 100 pages of his plan. Its complete garbage to say the least.
b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	According to the NYPD website, a conviction would bar you from employment, not an arrest however they will do a character background check. The best approach to fully understanding the ramifications to your situation would be the straight forward approach; ask the NYPD.     If you decide to be deceptive in your inquires, you are not likely to pass a character background check. Good Luck!|`|W9B6EJrWaa	Oh yes absolutely.  NYPD and NYS Corrections are FULL of crooks and criminals and thugs and drunks and they're as close and tight-knit as the mob.    If you're a felon you'll feel right at home working with those psycho's.|`|nfXbqCgZaa	Well, if the charge was dropped, your technically innocent.  However, the police department / corrections department will certainly be very interested in what the offense was and may look into it in order to find out the details of the case.|`|c07v7O80aa	It is likely going to depend on the specifics or why you were arrested and why it was dropped. Not a matter of specific hiring requirements but it's a background matter.
3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	It means, when you get your orders to your first duty station in AIT,    The Army will assign the new AIT graduates to fill open slots in units with upcoming deployments, before they assign them to other units.    It doesn't mean you Will be assigned to a Unit with an upcoming deployment.    It just means the Army will try and fill the manning charts of deploying units, before they fill the manning charts of non deploying units.|`|q3E1ouQvaa	If you find that alarming, perhaps a military career isn't for you.|`|XzStbSPnaa	YES SOMEONE DOES !|`|RvS5YcPQaa	You are gonna go where they need you.|`|91vuNupCaa	It means that you will be assigned to the most critically needed position which is usually with a deploying unit.    CPO  U.S. Navy (Retired)  1968-1990|`|UHBbSeesaa	it means you scored well on the asvabs!   You are looking at some sort of a 14 mos, you'll get clearance.  You will be responsible for others well being.  be confident, and remember ,   would you like to do what you are gonna tell others to do?|`|0683ccd6412eda6bd75ac2f24a0c357aaa	You agree to go where the Army tells you to. Standard regulation to be in a military contract.|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Exactly what you say. The army are made for fighting.    Even National Guard and foreign US ally equavalent are almost guaranteed active service in Iraq or Afghanistan..

gau0w8LMaa	They did mention it just never got covered by the media. Fox has put it out there before, but not enough people got the message.     The republicans in the house and senate have been stonewalled by Pelosi and the rest of the liberal party. They put Draconian measures in to block any republican bill from being introduced.|`|AA11600810	For the simple reason that Obama never mentioned a stimulus plan.  He just rambled on about what he was going to do.  Behind closed liberal doors though, there obviously were discussions that did not include the right.  In a word, sabotage.|`|cZypvAK8aa	The mainstream media never covered the GOP's ideas or plans. They were too busy promoting pro-Obama propaganda.|`|9pXKZ5udaa	The republicans did not want to win the election. They knew what was going to happen in the next two years and they didn't want any part of it.....Obama is the fall guy.|`|tDZMJue9aa	um m obama looked bad long before the gop's came to light after all obama is the great pork spreader and spender...he asked for more during his term of 2 years than mccain did in all his years ....you shoulda thought before you voted.|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	The GOP never had a plan . .they still don't have a plan . .they just are still bitter they lost the election. The GOP doesn't have clue what to do . . instead of being concerned about the country and its people . .the GOP is playing politics hoping that everyone fails. They are playing games with your life.|`|3GPYFB2xaa	Nazi Pelosi never even let them voice their plan.|`|1UDDfDi6aa	WHY?    Better to see what the opposition offers and then you have topics worthy of consideration and review.  And with this socialistic piece of trash offered up by the Dems, the Republicans have a whole slew of arguments that should be seriously considered by all Americans.|`|eafeb487799eda2a8dd4f1d8cb95f9c8aa	At the time of the election they originally thought the 700 billion already thrown at the banks would be plenty.  Obama wasn't talking about a trillion dollar stimulus during the election either.  Although he was talking about a lot of spending.  McCain always said he believed in tax cuts and Obama believed in raising taxes (except for people under a certain amount).|`|K5IOSGXAaa	That's because they didn't have a plan. They are sore losers and are going to act like the spoiled kid who didn't get the puppy. Ugggh.
ntuJzqycaa	I'm with Dina W.    Bombing a country into rubble, killing their children and raping their women is great for business.    Got Halliburton stock?|`|whE5OQ26aa	That's why there are so many problems in America!|`|AA11908435	It's not Ok to spend a trillion in Iraq|`|AA10482044	They were hoping to get 30 or 40 years worth of oil for it w. a friendly puppet government installed in Iraq.  When forced to leave Al Qeada will take over and they will have the opposite.  The State isn't supposed to spend the money it has gained from US taxes on the same private individuals and businesses it took the money from or it might as well not have taken it.  Spending it on social programs, pensions and welfare would simply stoke inflation and necessitate high interest rates.|`|KX1R4OQfaa	The war created jobs.. many of them    How many jobs is this new proposal creating?  Hardly any.        Obama just sent over 30,000 troops to Afganistan...  I think he understands the economics of war.|`|Sqp6HjtMaa	They can't connect the dots. They think it is totally irrelevant and unpatriotic to help Americans.|`|zBEzl2FLaa	cuz good things came out of the war in Iraq and the new "stimulus" plan is bullshit    When we went into Iraq we had two goals: get So-damn Insane out of power was the first and the second was to make sure they didn't have any WMD's.    We accomplished the primary goal of getting Insane out of power and Iraq is now a democracy.  The only reason we are still over there (and should remain there for at least 10-15 more years) is to make sure that the insurgents do not take Iraq over again.    Obama wants the new stimulus package to focus on shizz that is irrelevant to  what is going on with the economy (for example, new railroads that about 1/2% of the population is going to use). Also, increased government spending caused the Great Depression to worsen and I gaurantee you the government wasn't spending $816 billion back in the 30's and 40's. The only reason we ever got out of the Great Depression, was because WW2 meant that we needed to spent a lot of money to supply the materials needed for the war and we bought the materials from American companies.    did i elaborate enough for you??|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	The US has not spent a trillion dollars in Iraq.    So that kind of makes your question meaningless.|`|ctcCPMdCaa	They know that's true, but it would hurt their pride too much to admit that Bush duped them.|`|D6kwriPxaa	Because Republicans would rather give money to foreigners than to the average American citizen.|`|3M6GuYOzaa	cause it helps americans out :ooo so totally unamerican!|`|OqctF1H3aa	Common sense should tell you that both are wrong.
qWSle4i8aa	Megan... I guess he wasn't addicted to coke,but he did admit to using it.And of course he did obtain it legally?  Obama did admit to doing cocaine. The problem is Rush is an entertainer.Not an elected official.Shouldn't we hold our elected officials to a higher standard?|`|cDaxALCFaa	Because Rush's Addiction was more recent and is still in the news.  Obama's Addiction was when he was a young man.|`|HY1bH1Phaa	Idiots can only dwell on things they can't understand|`|SaxjkMbSaa	Because any criticism of the Obamessiah causes Liberals to get their panties in a bunch as they respond to any facts  that you offer  exposing any of BHO's many shortcomings  by hurling juvenile insults at you as veins bulge at their neck and little drops of spit fly from their mouth.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Just more hypocrisy from the liberal left.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Haha, great point!|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	They are hypocrites.|`|g0lKlQGnaa	Makes about as much sense as Algore cruising the country in his gas guzzling jumbo jet to teach us about global warming|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Obama admitted that?  Because Rush admitted his. . .  So your's is speculation, but ours on Rush is FACT.    And I don't freak out, unless Rush paints himself knowing more or being better than another.  He is nothing but a hypocrite, and should be treated just like every other human.  If I had been stealing oxycontin, I would be in prison.  Guess Rush loves our government and justice system when it works for him, huh?|`|K5IOSGXAaa	I think you been hitting the pipe, hater....|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	You mean Rush's very recent past and Obama's ancient history, right?|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	Well . . how come conservatives with all those values were not horrified that George W Bush was an alcoholic who was arrested for drunk driving . . .  I could care less whether Rush Limbaugh or GWB were addicted to drugs and alcohol . .but conservatives are the ones who claim to have high moral values . . so its okay for conservatives to be drunks and addicts but not liberals. Right. That is called hypocrisy.|`|EULVtVDvaa	1st off Obama was not addicted to crack ... I think he tried coke in college . I'm a Republican and not a Obama fan . As far as Rush ... yes he did have a Oxy problem but is clean . The Libs in my opinion are afraid of Rush because he speaks his mind and for the most part he is right . I thinks its pretty bad that our President would make a remark not to listen to Rush ..... I'm sorry but I will listen to anyone I damn please -|`|KF48OjyDaa	Because Rush has based his entire career on criticizing other people...he's a giant...reallly giant...enormously giant hypocrite|`|92gN7RVPaa	Obama wasn't on crack, so this question is irrelevant.|`|BQXg09m9aa	For your information..Obama has NEVER been addicted to crack. He'd done it but he's never been addicted...    Get your facts together missy, and sit back and relax and let us Democrats take over the stage, you hear me???|`|521978f4254c4b8f2b7244300239e951aa	I think you need to provide a reliable source to back-up your claims about both Rush and Obama.... (and I don't even like Rush!)|`|9bgBIzjFaa	Who is saying Obama's crack is in his past?  Look for yourself he's still on the pipe   http://www.flickr.com/photos/87719210@N0...|`|fRCoMzXkaa	They're not freaking out about it, they're just throwing in Republican faces when Republicans try to posture as morally superior (which is constantly).|`|AA10317675	There are plenty of examples of hypocrisy among liberals, but this isn;t one of them.    There is no evidence of Obama ever being addicted to anything but cigerettes.  Yes, he did experiment, but there is no evidence he got addicted.|`|9650396843d5fb5c87832f3226bd9287aa	Obama wasn't addicted to crack, or coke for that matter.  Cigarettes yes.    The buffoon Limbaugh was not only addicted, but acquired them illegally.    But, if they've both stopped, why does it matter?|`|tAej7qsqaa	Your right and it's funny how few people know this. He wrote about his drug use in his book, "Dreams from My Father."
0V1SkpiFaa	It works out to about $1.3 million a day, according to the CBC.    As far as a "small number of troops" goes, Canada has about 10% of the population of the US, which means that for the US to make the same proportional contribution in Afghanistan as we do, they'd have 25000 troops in place. The US actually has about half that.|`|pwdv08hVaa	how many troops they got there? a thousand? they aren't spending very much    still that is a very small number of troops
VxTYl48Caa	First off I do not hate anyone.  I believe in free enterprise, I believe that hard work pays off and big taxes don't help.  I believe in my constitutional rights and it isn't the gun that kills but the person who has it in its possession.  I believe that parents have the right to teach and raise their children not the school system. I believe that children should not be born before they have breathed their first breath.  I believe that people should be able to choose to kill and not forced by the freedom of choice act forcing medical employees to kill babies regardless of their beliefs.  I believe that radio and media should not be censored.  I believe we should not go crawling to a group of people who massacred our citizens and tell them we want to be friends.  I believe in freedom.  I believe in little government. I don't believe in social programs, free hand outs.  Somebody pays.  I don't believe I can balance my budget by charging more than me, my children, my grand kids and my great grand kids can pay in their life time.  BO is an opposite on all of these and I do not believe he will do anything but destroy this country, destroy our freedoms, destroy our military and destroy our economy.  He wants to take away our constitution, our free enterprise and turn us in to a marxist society.|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	I hate Obama because I am informed.      I understand who he is, his agenda, his policies, his voting record, and his experience.|`|G1sEBPQkaa	He's from Chicago. The culture of corruption. The only good thing that ever came out of Chicago was Lincoln.|`|6Ch7vbKfaa	Me - because I see him for what he is: a tax and spend guy who is naive and dangerous.|`|yprHJNHAaa	I see you have some outlandish comments.  Seems Obama is being blamed for the shape the country is in.  George Bush ALLOWED 9/11 to happen....had he listened to Sandy Berger and Richard Clark, 9/11 would not have happened.  Bush was on vacation...asleep at the helm.      As to the financial demise...Bush couldn't even manage a baseball team.  What a moron.  He started two wars and gave huge tax breaks...the just announced on the news that the 40 richest families in American gained financially these last 8 years. You NEVER give tax breaks with a war.  And Exon reported the highest profit...hmmm, I wonder why...Bush and his band of thieves in Congress were always giving the oil companies tax breaks...and money.      Do I hate or dislike Obama?  Nope...anyone who would step forward to try and clean up the mess of the last 8 years...well the republicans should kiss his feet!  They are part of the problem of the last 8 years.  I feel sorry for him.  No matter what he does....he will be wrong.        I bet half the people on this website don't know that Bush vetoed legislation to give health care to children...or that the republicans DO NOT believe in equal pay for equal work...yeah, that right...women should be paid less.  If you really want to know how horrible your elected leaders are...check out their rating at this website:|`|9bgBIzjFaa	Many unborn babies (like Obama could have been)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2CaBR3z8...|`|1UDDfDi6aa	I hate socialism and what it is doing to this country and the man is a socialist.|`|7kMKqLvGaa	He hung out with questionable people like ayers, wright and farrakhan.  I can't trust him.|`|8pKyzuy3aa	I love President Obama. Would love to meet him one day.|`|YDlfu6AUaa	Finding an honest Politician is like looking for a needle in the Pacific Ocean.  I dont' think ALL of them are corrupt just 99% of them are.    And no, I don't like Obama one bit to me he's no different than any of the others before him.  He dances to the tune of the same drummer only he sings a different song.|`|4zijn0cgaa	all the well informed because they are well informed.|`|mT6b7INZaa	When I think about Sarah Palin standing in the doorway winking at me, masturbation becomes joyful and so fulfilling.|`|ZzHE0lvtaa	That would be me and it is because he is an arrogant, self absorbed person who's ideas are going to hurt our country, if he implements any of them we may reach the point of no return.  Remember when you lose your freedom it is nearly impossible to get it back, it sure doesn't come free.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	I do.   I was going to give him a chance when he was inaugurated.    Then he closed Gitmo and lifted the ban on funding overseas abortions.  He did himself in on those two decisions right there.|`|52cGZS3caa	Most all of the kiddies claiming they listen to Rush when they are actually in school.|`|7mOfekBWaa	time to get some marshmallows. you're going to see a whole bunch of flaming.    obama 08.  >_|`|OqctF1H3aa	I dislike the man.

If they are being taxed more then there are less jobs on the market and more companies go over seas.    The United States is currently has the 2nd highest tax rates for business...  You wonder why our jobs are being outsourced and shipped over seas.  Maybe if the Democraps actually thought about tax cuts then this country would be better.|`|PHUdNRHnaa	No, it would tax cuts on everyone and cutting out government programs destined to fail (welfare, social security) Cutting taxes on both ends would allow companies more capital to hire workers and consumers a better chance to buy luxury items.

Daddy didn't hug you enough loser?|`|WBDsKwylaa	Mexico is so worried and concern about their people why is it only when they leave that Mex loves them, they are heros,etc,etc  and we are the ones paying the price for it.Mexico will never change as long as Mexicans just sit around day dreaming,wishful thinking,it will change but let somebody else do it.1 billion how about 825 billion ?|`|bzNjJbzQaa	does not make sense your question.|`|AA12374184	No, we should get all these mexicans out of here.

F'n Stupid people in charge in this country. There is going to be no-one left in mexico in 20 years or sooner and I figure americans can take that country over and in 10 years after the mexicans can sneak back over and then we can make a plan to put up a wall like the one in china. If we had a china wall this world would be much safer. Goverment loves that coke money and thats a fact.|`|BF7jcWxdaa	We have to do something. Have to get job at health dept.

93M8Vccvaa	Human nature. People see a cop behind them and almost all the time they think they will be pulled over for something.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	I'm thinking why is that, you're just in so much wonder of what you were doing that was bad. Something slipped your mind and you screwed up.  A lot of people don't enjoy screwing up.|`|c07v7O80aa	It's just one of those things. I don't think it's any particular guilt or fear. I think it's more the feeling of can't decide to drive on as they normally would, right along with the other traffic, or rigidly stay to the limit and look like they're too aware of the officer being there, and that sets up some stress. The officer is probably thinking, "Alright, already. I'll speed up so you can all get moving again."|`|74GedAO2aa	the reason people worry when a cop gets behind them is that they like to be good people and they dont like to get into to trouble at all|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Knowing that the gentleman in question belongs to one of the highest suicide, alcohol abuse groups, has a group mean IQ of 91, and....oh yeah, is heavily armed, rarely does much for one's serenity.|`|482c3c164b9ceae77a848c4b02f2704eaa	Most people get that way, I think fear is a normal human emotion.|`|AA11304359	Its because police are meant to be intimidating, their job and life depends on their scare factor.  It is dangerous for them to be in the position whereby someone (perhaps a perpetrator) is not immediately afraid of them.  This is because intimidation and fear is what puts them at an advantage, even if its to subconsciously persuade you to tell the truth.  Therefore when uniforms are designed for them (and they are designed) it is done in such a way to promote fear.  They wear their hats low on their heads to look menacing, their cars are painted to look authoritative etc.  The carry themselves in a no nonsense manner to immediately make you feel uneasy.  They tailgate you on the highway to sort of BULLY you out of the way;  even if they are not on the way to an emergency.      We usually feel uneasy around them because at their whim than can pull you over and accuse you of something that you have not done, or have in fact done inadvertently, and from that moment on, its your word against theirs.    What most people don't know, is that police CAN AND DO LIE to get their way and/or to get you to give up the truth.  They are allowed to lie as a means of persuasion.    I did pass a NJ state trooper because he was holding up traffic and everyone around his was afraid to pass him.  Well, I am a mature individual whom was doing nothing wrong, I wasn't speeding;  but he DID pull me over and gave me a frivolous ticket that I beat in court 2 months later.  And guess what?  3 months later, he pulled me over again; and I argued with him about his harrassment and he acquiessed right there on the spot and did not give me another ticket.    Oh Yeah  and    Bob H.  (see above) also has a very valid point.|`|xzEPg0afaa	cuz da police hates us and will alwayz be tryin to get us in trouble!!|`|YYpI9Md9aa	Because the police can make false charges  against you and you can't win. They can shoot you and cover it up.  I always keep a dozen doughnuts in the car for that possibility.    Actually you can have fun with the police when they start to pull you over. I learned them when I was a cop. Really messes them up.|`|qwaWd14vaa	Fear of the unknown.  What did I do or do they think I did. (Second guessing)  Also why police do not like to use sirens and lights on a call, one give the crooks an alarm of here we come, then the normal public panic, ever seen the panic it can cause, they drive in all directions to get out of the way or just stop in the road abruptly?   You have to laugh but it is a serious situation when people lose control and cause accidents all because you turned on your lights and siren?|`|4KlVkaDaaa	They carry guns, and they have unlimited power in the moment you have to deal with them.  That's usually unnerving.  You just hope they aren't corrupt.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	Because of the things that the cops do to people.     i.e. The Rodney King Case.

i0vcEyJtaa	He wasn't good at handling the Bay of Pigs invasion, which was a total failure. I have to give him credit in avoiding a nuclear war with the USSR, he ordered a withdrawal of the missiles we had in Turkey, so the USSR also withdrew their missiles from Cuba. He was also close to signing the bill to close down the Federal Reserve, which would have been a breath of fresh air, this central bank has been destroying us since their creation.|`|whE5OQ26aa	I could be sarcastic, but I'm going to be a man and behave.|`|ofP7bbX7aa	Yes, he was the first to use the media to get his message across because he had a hostile congress that would not support his programs.

He did not believe in a free ride for anyone.|`|AA10652652	He screwed up the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile crises.  He also expanded the Vietnam conflict.

He comes from a huge family of politicians and two Kennedy's today could still run office. Although Carolyn Kennedy didn't end up taking Hiliary's senate seat.

64SObnr5aa	The unemployment rate is not a good indicator of our economic health because as it stands now, there are significant area's that are ignored.  One of the biggest is the ones who have fallen off the unemployment rolls are no longer counted.    My college economics professor said that a far better and honest indicator would be the employment rate.      As of Dec 2008, we had 154.44 million people in our labor force  With another 80.58 million not in the labor force  Which does not add up, we have over 300 million people in America, the figures account for 235 million, what happened to the other 65 million? I am assuming they are not counting children and those above 75, but why not?    If we instead took the employment figure, December 2008 it stands at  143.33 million people employed.  December 2007 it was 146.29 million people employed  A drop of almost 3 million jobs in one year.  http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/emps...    Thus, by taking the above numbers, plus factoring average age of our population, our population growth, etc, etc, a very simple way of an honest snapshop of our employment health could be had that would be steady data year in and year out.    Seriously, we could get in a major depression and show an unemployment rate of 15%, but that figure is artificially low because of the way we fudge the numbers and the real figure could be double.    The employment figures are a lot harder to fudge, unless they do dishonest statistical gathering and change the definition of what is considered an employed person.  Such as lowering the number of hours worked, or even saying a person is employed for a whole year, even though they worked for only 6 months.    As far as the housing costs, I would agree with you, double digits.  I think anyone who takes on a huge mortgage now is foolish.  What people should be doing is their best to get out of debt, then in the future make a vow to never again be in debt.  Debt is slavery, it is the worst form of taking away your own freedom.  If the government acted the way we do in that regard, we'd hang our elected officials in a heartbeat.  Why do we do that to ourselves?  The answer is simple, because we have been programmed from birth that borrowing to prosperity is the only way to achieve the American dream. But that dream, for many, amounts to self imposed tyranny.     Peace  Jim    .|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Right now the unemployment rate is between 6 and 7 percent.  During the great depresion it was closer to 25% nation wide or higher.  I expect unemployment to rise way higher if the union supporting laws are really enacted, they might reach 30% or more.  And you are right homes will fall in value as people are able to pay less.  There is a direct relationship but I have no idea what it is.    It unemployment reaches those levels I suspect there will be more problems than the values of homes.|`|35ZJauLkaa	14.5% unemployment  35-45% on home devaluations|`|NnUAXyCGaa	Remember Carter?

Recessions generally last 10-11 months, but if the current Spending plan passes close to as is--Unemployment will be 10.5% year end and in some states 15%. Homes will fall another 10-20%, depending on location.    If a true Stimulus plan is passed, Unemployment will be in Mid 9% and homes will be down 4-5%, depending on location.    This Recession will last longer than normal as the Dems do not want a growth economy they want a Govt dependent economy--which is drain all capital from the private sector.
CnFU7cf6aa	(Don't confuse Taliban with alQueda)  In my opinion: never.  The idea of radical terrorism won't die as long as there are people to hear it and be influenced by it.

Also margie k...keep drinking that kool aide, look at this link and then say there's no Proof!    Obama's internet campaign started out innocently enough with basic e-mail networking , lists saved from previous party campaigns and from supporters who visited any of the Obama campaign web sites.  Small contributions came in from these sources and the internet campaign staff were more than pleased by the results.    Then, about two months into the campaign the daily contribution intake multiplied. Where was it coming from? One of the web site security monitors began to notice the bulk of the contributions were clearly coming in from overseas internet service providers and at the rate and frequency of transmission it was clear these donations were "programmed" by a very sophisticated user.    While the security people were not able to track most of the sources due to firewalls and other blocking devices put on these contributions they were able to collate the number of contributions that were coming in seemingly from individuals but the funds were from only a few credit card accounts and bank electronic funds transfers.   The internet service providers (ISP) they were able to trace were from Saudi Arabia, Iran, and other Middle Eastern countries.   One of the banks used for fund transfers was also located in Saudi Arabia.     Another concentrated group of donations was traced to a Chinese ISP with a similar pattern of limited credit card charges.|`|1bd85631073271d95decc164ad2f14a2aa	If this were to happen and the government would force "equal time," how would the government decide which candidates get to have some of that time?

After all the ACORN accusations, and the intense scrutiny President Obama's campaign, in general, received from the Republican Party, not a single charge has been made. Not one campaign contribution that was questionable was not returned. Not a single cent has been attributed to any overseas donors. What you have stated is an flat out LIE.  As far as the campaign laws stand, McCain and Obama had the OPTION of taking government funding. Obama made the wiser decision. He had far more people willing to donate to his campaign. That is usually the case with the winner. What you are suggesting is ludicrous. Sounds like sour grapes to me.|`|2810d5a41e887ab0439f9306db1c4680aa	Not really because then the government in power can determine who gets heard and who does not.

It should be part of their license requirements. As far as the contributions, your information about Obama is incorrect and in fact, a lie. You are pretty bright, don't mess it up with that nonsense. I agree with one answer that time limits should be set on campaigns though. And by the way, big companies etc. cannot just give huge amounts of money to campaigns, it is already limited. What is so amazing about Obama's campaign is the sheer number of SMALL donations by a huge amount of regular working Americans who believed in him and still do. The Repubs couldn't stand this fact and so investigated - and found nothing wrong. Sore losers.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	Last time I looked, this was America, and the GOVT does not "give" press time to anyone.

He's a fiscal conservative and that's what's important to me.|`|hdcLCk8Faa	You are not unless you are using liberals as your measurement. I also agree that I am waiting to see if Steele will push to his moderate leanings or push to bring back true Conservatism. If he moves left-I will fight him just as I did the last RNC Chair.|`|SFhITXHMaa	"...So that arab can be president?"-Not only are you a racist, you're also an idiot.

esOaJoqBaa	Warrant officers are experts in their field. They were all once enlisted men who were chosen as having great knowledge and experience in their MOS.They go through the same training as commissioned officers, but do not have a degree.   They rank above enlisted men but rank below commissioned officers, whom they still have to salute. Despite this most junior commissioned officers show a lot of respect to warrant officers because they have earned it.    Another of the primary differences between commissioned officers and warrant officers is that warrant officers are not in charge of many men. While have authority over anyone they outrank, they do not have command of anything more than a few men. They usually assist a commissioned officer in the technical aspects of their field, but are not in direct command of troops. A W-3 with 20 years in may only be in charge of 5 men in his office, while and enlisted man or commissioned officer with that same time in would have command over hundreds of men.|`|WJDJ2vIoaa	As with other services, like Army, the Warrant Officer is a technical officer specialist.  Click on the link below for more info.  Generally meaning, this person is an expert in the particular field of expertise.  You don't salute a warrant and the pay is better than enlisted.  However, Warrant's generally don't manage staff and generally do their own thing, keep out of the eye of the senior rank, etc..  It's certainly a good rank to hold, especially if you don't want to get into management as a regular officer or at the very least want to make officer pay.|`|cekZba0Uaa	A warrant officer is a formerly enlsited marine who shows he is an "expert" in his MOS, you become a Warrant Officer by putting in a package to your carrer planner and being selected as one.  Enlisted have to salute Warrant Officers, and and Officers, but not higher ranking enlisted marines.|`|oqOKavxHaa	A warrant officer is an enlisted Marine (i.e. didn't go to college, get a degree, and become commissioned) who worked their *** off and became an absolute expert in their M.O.S. (military job).    Usually they have at least reached the rank of a Staff Sergeant before they can even hope of trying to become a warrant officer.    Here is a link to the 2009 military pay structure    http://www.militaryfactory.com/military_...    In it you will notice three boxes.  The lowest one is starts with E-1 The E stands for enlisted.  The top box starts with O-1 and the O stands for Officer.  In between the two boxes you will see the W-1 through 5.  This is the Warrant Officers ranking structure.  It only goes up to E-5 and from there you can technically be promoted to an O-1 and up to an 0-4 although this is very very rare.    As an enlisted Marine you will be expected to salute all officers, both regular officers and commissioned as long as you are 1) Outside (and thus not wearing a hat) and 2) Are not in the field.  (Training for combat or in a combat zone).    Officers salute officers above them in rank, but enlisted men never salute other enlisted Marines regardless of how high they are in enlistment rank.  But they (enlisted Marines) do salute ALL officers.  Or else!  :-)    Hope this helps, e-mail me if you have any other questions.|`|VOyzSjEuaa	A warrant officer is neither a "formerly enlisted marine" nor is he "an enlisted Marine who didn't go to college or didn't get a degree".  Those answers are simply unwarranted and meaningless.    A Warrant Officer is simply a technical expert in the field.  I have a two friends who have become Warrants after retiring from the military as officers, only because they were offered active duty overseas and wanted to keep under the radar, but also continue to serve.
WBlgJrqlaa	Honestly, as most of them told it would take a minimum of 5 years and could take a real long time.. However, their are other ways of obtaining your citizenship to US without waiting for so long.. Taking into consideration, that you have clear background and have steady income with no criminal record, you could get this processing done within one and an half years.. All you would have to do is to approach immigration lawyers.. Getting a good immigration lawyer might take you a while to find, but is worth it.. Looking at your background and your status, immigration lawyers make petitions which would help your case move fast. Also, when required immigration officers would contact immigration lawyers and information transfer would be faster.. My friend from pakistan obtained his citizenship within 1 and an half years.. All I know is he had gone through immigration lawyers and had his processing done fast without wasting time...     All the best|`|1wb9rotSaa	I have lived here for 13 years and I still don't have my green card.  I  will prob have to wait until i am married. You can apply for citizenship three years after you have your green card.    Good luck :D|`|Oh3V69rVaa	Too long!!|`|f4x7V1sZaa	just marry an american|`|SawySuLRaa	You can wait as long as fifty years if you want to.

70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	You say, "mother-in-law," so I'm assuming your married.    When you marry, you inherent another family. Your mate's mother will ALWAYS be her mother. Try and learn to get along with her or you may not ALWAYS be her son-in-law.    Blood is thicker than water the majority of the time.|`|eu6UQElYaa	If her daughter is under the age of 18, then yes you should break up because at that point she's a minor and her mother has a right to say who she dates and who she doesn't (even if her mother is bigoted and racist, her reasoning for not wanting her daughter to date you doesn't matter at that point).   If she's over 18, then it's entirely up to her daughter and you two should just continue to date and enjoy your lives.  I'd suggest being nice to her mother (she isn't your mother-in-law if you two are just dating).  Maybe you'd win brownie points that way and prove that you aren't all those things she probably thinks you are.|`|9cpKYneZaa	Just be nice. You don't have to love her, just her daughter. And BTW, be good to the daughter as mom might be a psycho.|`|PY4BOTltaa	how old are you seriously that she is sneaking out to see you and your married to the girl... if thats the case get your own house but be polite to the mother in law or you will just confirm her sterotyping.|`|ZwJQg8yIaa	No way. If you love her, and you know she loves you back, then don't worry about her mom. Racist or not, she'll have to get over it eventually. Hope I helped. Good luck!!|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Sounds like the Daughter is a Minor and  she doesn't want her going out with anyone...    That does not make her a racist,  just a protective mother...  Also means if you are over 18 you  can be arrested...which I think is probably  the case...    Please do not mix up   "Lust with Love"    If you are a Punk in da hood...  Black/White/Hispanic doesn't matter  I sure wouldn't want my daughter going  out with any of them...
AA11494150	The US Supreme Court recognized handwriting as an identifying physical characteristic in the case Gilbert v. California. Gilbert was convicted of armed robbery and the murder of a police officer. A handwritten note used in the robbery, compared to his handwriting, was used as evidence in him in court.     They use something called a "Handwriting Exemplar" to identify patterns in your handwriting. Here are some examples:  http://www.ost.state.or.us/divisions/fin...  http://jjhandwriting.com/PDF/handwriting...    The officers themselves do not examine the documents. The form is sent to the crime lab, along with the forged document. A handwriting analyst examines the samples, compares them to the questioned document, and determines if they were completed by the same person.    Additional: Looks like someone gave the US Supreme Court a "thumbs down" for my answer. Whoever that was, please email me so I can send you the case law confirming my answer is correct.|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No,    they aren't trained in that field.|`|c07v7O80aa	Not really. The analyst section for that work is called Questioned Documents. They can often talk about consistencies or inconsistencies, but they can't really declare that this person made that writing. More often, if they render an opinion, it's that a writing was not made by an individual. No competent expert is going to conclude that a writing was made by a specific person by examination of the writing alone.     If there's a more definite conclusion, it's more often made by the combination of writing consistent with that of an individual plus fingerprints from the document, which are readily developed in most cases.    On the other hand, it is usually easy to detect a whole array of inconsistencies in a forgery, no matter how good the forger.|`|8PCriC7Vaa	Nope, but they have professional paid witnesses that are willing to say they can.|`|5f5749d37610dbd9abaec08095263c26aa	A handwriting expert can tell if two samples of writing were written by the same person ... so if one sample is known to be yours, the expert can match other written documents to that sample.      They can not just look at a single sample of handwriting and determine who wrote it.  They require two samples to compare with each other.|`|gDSJpRvTaa	Yes...End of Story...|`|D4jdJl7Oaa	yes|`|6y94LMmqaa	The police, No a hand writing analist yes!|`|nfXbqCgZaa	No, it's not really the police that do it, but a handwriting expert, but yes your handwriting can be identified.|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Yes they can. There is a whole science based on handwriting. It is very individual almost as much as a finger print. Only the very best forgers can fool experts and even good forgery is very difficult.|`|YYpI9Md9aa	YES- my good friend did it for the FBI until her MS got worse. She did it for us for fun. It is spooky.|`|xzEPg0afaa	not if u write in spanish!!|`|qwaWd14vaa	Not the police per se but the people who do the analysis of your handwriting.  See wikipedia-Graphology and Graphoanalysis.  Each stroke of the letters and words can be broken down into many categories of psychological interpretations analysis or recognitions.|`|e61e97ce7197ef3797fdc64f3b935342aa	No, it isn't the police that analyze Hand Writing. Its Forensic Scientists, specifically those who specialize in Hand Writing Analysis. Its a long and boring process but it is do-able and even if you try and fake your hand writing you can still tell. You can also tell certain things like mental states and other emotions too. Although this cannot be used for Forensic Purposes and is really more for the fun of it.|`|n1kLMYCeaa	Yes|`|dxPIPCESaa	actually im not even sure about that they might not because many people write the same and if they mistake u, the police will get in trouble noy u!|`|d8TGK92jaa	Yes they can, there is a whole science based on handwriting analysis. I can also tell you what mood you were in when you wrote it.

The UCMJ (military law) allows execution in a combat zone for insubordination, war crimes such as rape and civilian murder, or the murder of a US or allied soldier.
AA10719402	They used to track M1, M2, and M3 money supply to track inflation, but the Bush administration put a stop to M3 money tracking in 2006.    Now, the primary source of inflation data is the consumer price index.    M3 tracked repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve, but now there is no official reporting of that.  It was often considered the best way to determine the amount of money and credit being created.    Lots of people assume that government spending will increase inflation, but sometimes that money is already in existence overseas.. it is merely a lending of money that already has circulated into foreign governments.      Another thing to remember is that inflation more often occurs through the issuance of capital these days rather than cash.      Many many foreign governments hold the dollar.  Some peg their currencies to it.. some use it to buy oil denominated in dollars.     Inflation can come from any of these things.. not necessarily just an arbitrary printing of money.  Even if money is printed, it is loaned out to banking institutions who will hopefully then loan it out for growth.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	way to much

h31daXpqaa	if you cant afford a Visa how will you be able to take care of her when she gets here ??|`|T8nap2Pnaa	well, you would have to have physically met before you could file a fiance petition. so, she'd have to apply for a tourist visa either in Moscow or one of the several consulates there. by the way, Russia is infamous for online scams, so proceed with serious caution. for one thing, never having met this person, you can't even be sure this person is a woman, or if she is, much of anything else about her. so, if you buy a ticket, make sure only you can get a refund on it. the more money  you're asked to send, the greater the probablity this is a scam. if you doubt this, check out the Country Specific Information sheet for Russia at travel.state.gov and the embassy website.

3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Not so.    MLB is considered an anti-trust agency, thus doesn't get taxed.  In this, they have to keep the competition pure and clean.  The players using Steroids are violating that, thus causing MLB to be in danger of paying some serious penalties, as well as some serious taxation in the future.    I think it is in everyone's best interest to clean up that mess.  Because if they don't then prices for anything related to MLB will go up 2000%.  Don't be a fool - that will effect us all.  Employment, betting, revenue, etc. . .  It all comes back to it in the end.  So as long as they are considered anti-trust, the government WILL be involved.
