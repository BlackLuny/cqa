20090219205600AAArKzv	Social Science;Psychology	Can someone help me in my dilemma (social/art)?	Ok, so I've been asked to paint a door @ my school. He's considered to be one of the best teachers (which I can see why) yet I don't really know him, as I never had him as a teacher. I'm part of his newspaper staff as the (only) illustrator. So I guess that's how it eventually got to this(he wanted paintings on his door, I wanted to paint).   Here's the thing, I was told beforehand I wasn't gonna get paid. That's alright, I get recognition (I'm not one of those shining star scholars/athletes). Yet, now that I'm doing it, it just seems odd. I have already started painting, yet I feel I can't ask to not do it at this point. Originally, I chose to do it as a way for me to improve painting (I'm more of a pen/pencil guy), but I'm not really motivated, as I don't feel any real reason to do so. I think if I were to make it for the art teacher (on materinty leave), I'd probably be more motivated, as she honed my drawing/painting skills, in addition to introducing me to sculpture/printmaking. I'm not sure, it just seems to me (my self analysis) that because I don't have any true connection with him, I don't feel like giving a full 100% effort. Should I try to establish relations with him (he seems to have interests like me in music, philosophy, and ethics)? He seems a lot like my art teacher, both are pretty mellow, down to earth, very philosophic (which can manage to make me talk despite being introverted), and both are vegans, which is kinda ironic). Any advice?

They asked me if I wanted to come aboard. I replyed no. The one man yelled down for me to stay safe. Suddenly this man appeared. He has gray thick hair, with glasses, and a gotee. He asked me to follow him, I did. I entered this doorway, which has eletricty, and a stream of darkness. I was then on the ground, were people wearing suits were walkng by. It almost looked like a 1940,s enviroment. The man showed up again, and asked me if I wanted a ride. We eventually drove to this highway. I seen this green trees around. I asked him were we are going he looked over at me and looked back like he was really trying to get me somewhere quickly. We appeared in this darkness. He started to grow bigger, then he and the car vanished. I was just floating there. I then seen something appearing out of nothing. This window or opening appeared. Through it I seen green fields, with crystal clear rivers, with this golden light. The light then came through the window, and touched me on my shoulder. The dream ended. What could this dream mean???

20090219210342AAMjfKk	Social Science;Psychology	Does my son need anger management?	Both of my boys are living at home and going to college. My youngest son is 19 and he’s always been a really good kid. He’s never caused me and my husband any trouble whereas my oldest (21) has always been quite a trouble maker. As a matter of fact that’s the exact response I’ve always gotten from their teachers.             The problem is my youngest has these outbursts of rage. About once a month he gets in a screaming match with his father. Sometimes he actually gets vioent though. It rarely rarely ever happens but when it does it’s bad. As a matter of fact I can only think of three times that it has happened. In all fairness to him he had every right to be mad each time but the way he reacts is just really extreme. One of these outbursts occurred at school his sophomore year. The parent of the other child actually threatened to file harassment papers! The principal and his teachers all agreed that his behavior was very out of character for him.            A few days ago though he and his brother were outside working on his truck. They got into a little argument and the oldest one ended up pushing him. He just dropped everything and shot him the evilest look. It was like all the color just instantly left his face. It scared me it truly didn’t even look like him. My oldest son tried to run but he just pounced on him. When I finally got him off of him he was fuming. He just walked in circles with his fists clenched, breathing heavy. He was still furious then he starts crying!           15 minutes later he comes in the kitchen like everything is fine! I heard that the fit he threw at school was bad and the second one his father had seen but this was the first time I had ever witnessed it for myself and it honestly scares me.            Should I talk to him about anger management? He’s always so mellow and nice I almost don’t think they would even believe he was capable of getting mad.
20090219210741AA7Pklf	Social Science;Economics	Why does the US give so much money to foreign countries?	A rational person would think, "Okay, we're in a recession.  We need to shore up all we can so that WE survive, not (some) third-world country that has nothing."  Call it cruel, call it whatever you'd like but I think it's crazy.  And it's  BILLIONS of dollars, is it not?   For the US to even say, "Okay, last year we doled out $300 billion to foreign countries.  For the next few years, until our economy strengthens, we're only going to give foreign countries $100 billion."     1) Where can I find out the amounts we give foreign countries   2) Who votes on these issues and where can I find this information?  It sure as hell isn't real Americans voting on this issue.      The sad thing is, Americans don't care to do anything about it. The way I see it, those who are honest and actually pay their taxes (and their mortgages and other bills) are too busy working to care about doing anything about the way those in Washington spend money.

"A Turkish court sentenced five members of the same family to life imprisonment for the "honour killing" of Naile Erdas, 16, who got pregnant as a result of rape, activists said Monday.      In its verdict, a court in the eastern city of Van sentenced the murder victim's brother to life in jail for the 2006 murder to cleanse the family honour, the Van Women's Association said.      The girl's father, mother and two uncles were also given life sentences for instigating the murder, while a third uncle was jailed for 16 years and eight months for failing to report the murder in one of the heaviest sentences handed down in Turkey for such a killing."    http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/pregnan...       Honor killings are often ignored by authorities in countries where they are relatively common, and entire families are rarely prosecuted, let alone sentenced to life in prison. Honor killings are uncommon in Turkey, but they do happen in the eastern part of Turkey. I personally think that all people involved in organizing honor killings should be given strict sentences like the ones Turkey gave to this family. Honor killings are organized by families and are not a gender issue (it's not about males killings females) but both males and females organizing to kill females for "shaming" the family...

20090219214855AA3fM1g	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why are we lying to our children?	I cam across a book called "The Language Police" by Diane Ravitch (amazon link below).  In it, she references policies educational boards which, among other things, strive to de-emphasize gender roles in children's books.      However, the way they go about doing it is odd, to say the least.  In one passage, she describes some of the "guidelines" that schoolbook authors and illustrators must follow.  Among them:      Career women must be portrayed as doctors, lawyers or plumbers.     Men must be portrayed as secretaries, nurses, or in other support positions.      As an aside, the guidelines also "suggest" that the elderly must not be portrayed as feeble, but rather depicted as active (such as jogging, or repairing a roof).      Now, I'm all for encouraging girls to be whatever they want to be, but portraying women as plumbers?  By suggesting that ONLY women do jobs that even today are mostly done by men, are we essentially LYING to our children?  Why not have a submarine fully crewed by women to encourage women to learn nuclear physics?      More importantly, if the intent is to encourage girls to be doctors and lawyers (and plumbers), what exactly is the intent with the boys?  to relegate them to the secretarial pool?  jeez - why not say daddy is a burger flipper, and one day, Jimmy, if you study really hard, you can be one too?

20090219214221AAJkCgY	Social Science;Psychology	Am I too introverted?	Ok so at high school, I'm not very talkative. Most of the things I say are either (most often to least) related to wanting of help, "No", cussing, and asking of interests. I've read that introverts are well respected in other parts in the country, yet not really here in the U.S. @ school, most of the a****les sometimes pick on introverts, not really me, as I don't do anything out of the ordinary or have any odd behaviors. But the thing is, I don't hang out with the people at my school, and I feel that's holding me back. I usually fear social situations, which I believe to be the reason as to why I don't answer or raise my hand in class. I don't know many people other than from my school, and I think that's kind of a burden. I'd like to go to prom(only because it's once in a lifetime, in about 2 months), but as my school is one gender, I wouldn't know who to ask unless I ask for a blinddate. I'd hate to go stag, even though I'm introverted. I also believe I have low self confidence. How can I open up in time to meet new people in time without placing myself in social situations that would make me anxious?

It is just a gift/curse that I was born with. Other members of my family have similar gifts/curses.       No, I am not on drugs or alcohol. I am very serious on this!

It is funny in a way. Like I said it can been seen as a curse as well as a gift and for many years I have seen it as a curse, but now I want it back.      Please, if you are not going to answer seriously then move on to the next question because I need advice on this.      Let me thank you ahead of time for your time.

I don't get it most of the time I feel like I don't like him and that i'm fine without him but when this happens momentary spasm of my emotions happens what is it?
20090219215050AAkFDZK	Social Science;Psychology	I hate the world, and I hate humans, I never really understand them, I guess this is normal?	Every time I look at humans, all I see is weird creatures with clothes on, and ears,mouths, etc..And It's quite funny to me. I never really understood life, the Government, why money meant so much to people. I don't get life, at all. I see life as a video game, sadly: New game, (Being born) you progress through the game (Growing up) You get towards the end of it (Growing kind of old, get bored of your life) And just when you are starting to grow fond of the game, BAM! You die, game over. Continue?   How weird our life is, all we want is power, control and money, why can't we just live our lives worry free? Not having to constantly feel like we're being watched all of the time? If we don't pay to live, then we get thrown in jail. I think this world is bullshit, the sooner we all die, the better.   It's not hard to understand people, It's impossible.    Well, that's all I have to say, I guess.
20090219215359AAomyfL	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Need help interpreting a series of weird dreams?	Recently I've been having these weird dreams and I'm not looking for "you need a shrink" answers if you can't help please try and take it elsewhere; but for those of you willing to help here it is.       I was in this big big room that was in an L shape there were about 15 other people in the room and a teacher, a man, the only thing that i can accurately say about the man was that he had a low monotonous voice. He began talking about philosophy and the other people my age were talking about how they were going to leave, though I didn't understand why. When they left, the teacher went after them but I remember the teacher being a woman here, and then returning as a man-and repeated itself a couple times. I never saw the other people again. After some time had elapsed it was just myself and the teacher figure left. The first room-the top part of the backwards shaped "L" room wasn't particularly a color-nor was it completely inside- there were trees and greens. But the second part of the "L" was a TALL room completely white and huge, with a table and ladder in the middle. He asked me to paint the walls and i did and he was there too, helping at some parts, but mostly supervising from the ladder-hunched over-not in pain but in comfort. I remember i was painting the bottom part of the wall and specifically remember the colors of and orange-red and an aqua blue, but it wasn't uniform it was all kind of meshed together like it shouldn't have made sense, but it looked nice. Shortly after I went into the bathroom which was the bathroom in my real house-though the rest of the dream had been somewhere else- I looked into the mirror and turned the lights on. My eyes- which are typically a very bright blue im constantly being asked if they are fake- were all wrong. The pupil was all a white/grey colour and faded out to the bright blue that was mine. The only thing that i have to relate it to would be [as dorky as this sounds] when Viktor Krum in Harry Potter was under the curse and his eyes were so strange- almost wild looking. I knew, if by some weird instinct, like if there were a voice speaking to me, that it was evil. I automatically closed my eyes and felt something inside me push or expel the abstraction. [In the past ive had the real life experience of seeing an angel, and its polar opposite,a tall black figure in which i resorted to closing my eyes and praying until i fell asleep- so there are similarities between the two.] I looked out and remembered thinking I should leave, but felt the instinct to help this person even though it I knew it was detrimental to my well being.      The next night I had a dream that I was becoming something. I wish it knew how to describe it but it was something supernatural but it maintained human form- like a witch or a vampire- just something that had abnormal abilities. I found myself in a family that wasnt mine, but I felt that feeling of complete trust and not only that but adoration for my new family. There was 5 of us i think and they kind of let me try to figure it out on my own, except for my "new" sister. She was blonde, like really flourescent blonde, but it was beautiful, natural. She tried to teach me things. We were in a public place so she wanted me to try and make myself "feel" or "see" another place, but to make it look normal -being that we were in a crowd- was to fake like we were talking on cell phones or something where our hands could reach our face. I did and it worked. I don't know how but I was completely away from the crowd and remember feeling disoriented but not in a way that bothered me- a way that soothed me, pleased me, fascinated me. When I "awoke" so to say I was in a laying in a car. My "new" motherly figure and sister were gawking at me when the found me. they knew what had happened. Apparently my sister had been the only one in the history of well whatever we were that could do what I did; but they looked at me as though I had done more. they were amazed-though i didnt know why. All I knew was that I was excelling at being something other than just human.
20090219222150AAnXvcY	Social Science;Economics	Do you think it would help people and the economy if certain monthly bills be garnished like child support is?	to make sure people don't get behind on necessary bills, their paychecks should be set up to be automatically garnished. No more late payments, no late fees, necessary bills be paid first then the rest goes to you for extras?      And in order to do this, jobs will be created for people to handle the garnishments, paperwork, datework, computer work, working with banks, etc. This would help people not get behind in paying bills and this would create jobs for people.      Thoughts?

20070727225135AAluqKE	Social Science;Psychology	Why am I overthinking everything?... Do I need help?	In the past few months, I've realized that I have a super overreactive imagination, am a very negative person, a worrywart, and think about things that aren't possible. For example, when I'm alone in my room, in my imagination I can always see clearly a picture of what could happen, like the CIA all of a sudden entering into my room, or someone coming and killing me, or a explosion, or me dying unexpectedly, and the list can go on and on forever... This is making me very confused, especially because I have been trying to find if I have a disorder, and I KNOW that I'm do not have the mind of a normal person. I imagine the impossible thinks, whether it's positive or negative. I've comed to question this is because of me always wondering about my thoughts and my life. Every single day, I'm always questioning everything about life, and I always feel like I understand life more than other people do... I know it sound weird, but it's true.. What is this? I know this isn't normal. What is it?

20090219222521AA1QbED	Social Science;Psychology	My sister is insensitive. She doesn't understand me.I'm so sad. Help?	I quitted my job and now I'm unemployed. My elder sister called me criticizing my resignation. My sister lives in a backward countryside while now I live in a prosperous city. I graduated from college last year. I have a bachelor degree. My sister didn't receive any higher education. She thinks that I should not resign,  even I want to resign, I should resign after I already find a new job. But I want to tell her is that the salary was low and the job was extremely boring and I couldn't learn anything from my former job because I worked almost like a machine. I think I'm young and I can't spend precious time on a job that I can hardly improve myself. Moreover, I felt very bad when I worked each day right before I resigned. The former company I worked at is going down. I tried to find another job before I quitted, but I failed. And the damn bad feeling with the former work was worsening and I felt I would freak out one day if I kept working in that company. I want a relief. Now I'm reading books to improve my ability so it will be easier for me to find a job, at least better than if I don't read those books. I want to tell my sister all this but she is impatient and doesn't bother to listen to me. She is anger at me and she is insensitive. She has never tried to wear my shoes. So my family don't understand me so I feel so sad. They don't understand me. No one understands me. I'm so sad. Help

20090219221017AAebVgP	Social Science;Psychology	How can someone show originality when they are always being compared to one another?	It seems that people are always comparing one another so that you don't notice their differences. There are BILLIONS of people on this planet, which makes you think that some people might seem extremely alike. This isn't true though and comparing them just distracts people from how unique they are.   f.e. Katy Perry and Lily Allen are both strong-willed women singers that sing about things that are strange but are not at all are they alike. NOT AT ALL!

20090219132511AAiczyt	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What should I be classified as?	I believe in treating her as a lady.   I believe I should protect her.   I wouldn't mind if she made as much money as I do (would actually enjoy it).   I pay attention when she talks even if it is gossip (I dislike gossip).   When we see a woman testing the tenth man to see if he's the father of her child, I say it's irresponsible, one time, to voice my opinion, then quietly sit back while she goes on a tirade about how it's the mans fault, that they are irresponsible in general and I just let her vent.   When she and her one friend visit, I sit back and let them slam on men continuously and just stay quiet because they are drunk and I am sober and it will lead to being chastised until I walk out of the room.   When she has told me that her friends guy should be helping her with bills because he makes good money (she lives in free housing with a cap on utilities at $60) and I say why (the woman has two jobs paying under the table cash). She then retorts (seriously) because they have sex. Later in the week we go to her house and she's with a different guy and I just look at her and she shoots me the "glare", then tells me on the way home how it's the other guys fault for not giving her money and I am given the silent treatment for the night (which I sort of appreciate since she's drunk again).   I am doing all normal things like asking if she wants something to eat,    asking if she wants something from the store, wants more coffee, trying to get some conversation going during these "silent" periods to get communication going again.   I end up taking the blame for causing the "silent" treatment even though it's 95% of the time alcohol induced.   I have never used the words B or C or W during any argument while it's perfectly ok for her to call names.      OK, obviously, I'm searching for confirmation as I am feeling beaten down,,,   Am I a:   doormat   enabler   pushover   mysogenist      Please, feel free to add any comments      Thanks

I had to get my boyfriend to stop them from coming after me. Then my boyfriend decides to buy a new snake that is ugly looking with a rainbow body. This snake jumps at me and bites the bridge of my nose. It stays there for about a minute until I can get it off of me. Other stuff happened in my dream. I see a girl I don't really like and I believe she was hassling me and I ended up pushing her away and stealing her purse? I'm not really sure, this part of the dream is a bit of a blur.       But when I woke up, I noticed I had a lot of missed calls on my phone. Turns out my gramma is in the hospital and doing pretty bad. was this dream a warning?       Also, today... I looked in my snakes habitat and my snake just shedded. I've had this snake for about a year and whenever she sheds she does it in pieces. Today when I looked I noticed a huge piece of shedded snake skin. She did the entire shed in one go.
20090219173707AAJEDuN	Social Science;Psychology	Why do i feel like this? is this normal?	sometimes, i just feel so sad. like i'll just be watching tv and then all of a sudden i just want to cry, and often, i actually do. and i dont really know why im crying.   sometimes, i get so..idk like mad but in a weird way. like anxious, too. i feel like my blood is running through my veins really fast. this usually happens if i do something, and i wish i hadnt, and i am wishing i could go back in time. like if i binge eat. i just want to rip my hair out, and sometimes i pull it just hard enough so it doesnt rip out. alot of times my head even gets swollen under the hair like i get bumps on it as if i had got hit by a ball. i feel like i want to cut myself, but i never do because i did before, and my sister noticed the cuts. so i just smack my head with my hands, hard. or sometimes i make it really cold in the house and dont let myself get a blanket, like to punish myself in a way.   and sometimes i feel like i want to kill myself. no joke. like i just consider my options. when i was home alone one day, i was really tempted to take the whole bottle of tylenol, but then my friend called and i kind of changed my mind. but then i think about it, and sometimes i just really want to just do it. like i think if i was on a cliff or something, i might just step off because after i do theres no turning back. im kind of afraid to start driving because i dont trust myself, i think i might purposely drive off the edge of an overpass or something.   and i have like the lowest self esteem ever, i have like zero confidence. but you would too, if you looked like me. i pretend i have confidence though, and it is really not obvious how much i hate the way i look. i look disgusting. im short, only 4'11", and i weigh 100 pounds. i look short and fat like im a thumb, all stubby. i wish i was tall and skinny and pretty. people always make fun of me saying i have a big nose, and that REALLY hurts. no matter what, i am never pretty.   i have suffered from bulimia and anorexia, but mostly making myself throw up because i barely have willpower to fast for long. and none of works, because i am still fat, i will never be skinny if i dont try harder, but idk why i cant, i always binge and ruin everything.   i always try to control things, and when something happens that is not according to plan, i get really upset. like sometimes i am so surprised at how i have no control over my thoughts and feelings it all just pours out at once. like i have this schedule, that has everything in my life on it, and when to do everything, from 100 situps a day, to which days i will pluck my eyebrows. and last week, i fell asleep, without putting on the facial mask like my schedule said, and the next day when i realized it, i just broke down. i started crying and got so upset with myself. and then i freaked out because i didnt know if i should put it on that day, or if it was too late.

It isn't really unusual, but I never really heard this ever happening to anybody.    I had a dream about my crush that I didn't acknowledge my feelings to hardly anyone...and I ended up either dumping him or rejecting his offer in having a relationship. The reason why was probably his obnoxious and arrogant way of speaking. So I ended up humiliating him in front of my class, and the Dance team...which consists entirely of girls. The Dance team ended up stepping all over his jacket for being a "player" or an ***. I didn't really think he deserved having his things vandalized...so I offered to pay for the damage out of guilt. Well...that was what I said.   I only started to admire him...when somebody said he had thing for me a while back..and by the way...he's considered a pretty boy. We never get to interact with each other because we're somehow faraway from each other. Also...I find loudmouths intimidating and not capable of listening or having patience with reserved people.       I'm thinking that I really don't want to have a relationship with him...I believe that is what my dream is telling me...straightforward...but there might be other symbols or meaning I missed...which I'm not aware of.       Anyways, thanks.

My parents then took me out of my room and into the car and we went to a celebration of a famous persons birthday and lots of celebrities were there... what does this rather strange dream mean?

20090219223547AAsXJcO	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Been having these dreams ....?	Ok so I have asked before but only got 2 answers and would like a few more opinions on these dreams. I also have a new one to add to the sequence so I will copy and paste my original post and then throw the new dream in there. I will label the new dream in this post.      Ok so I have been having some dreams all related to the same thing /person. After I expain them I will tell you what most people will probably think they mean but I dont beleive they do in the slightest and thats why im looking for opinions on the topic.      Ok so first I should explain a few things. Back in november my fiancee left me. For a few weeks things between us were great and it was like we were still together in every aspect but she didnt want to come back to me. Things eventually declined between us and I eventually found out she has been in love with her ex this entire time and going back to him. I was always led to believe she had never been in love with anyone before me. We started dating when I was 18 and I turn 22 in a week and a half. I havent heard from her in about a month if not longer and the last time we talked I told her I want nothing to do with her cause she doesnt deserve the time or attention I gave her.       I also have been talking to someone lately over msn who I am extremely interested in. She lives about 20 min drive from me but neither of us drive therefore we have not met. Our first meeting is this sunday though.      Ok onto the dreams.      In the first one me and my ex were sitting on the couch cuddling and watching a movie. We werent together and it was kind of how it was when we first broke up. Eventually we started making out and becoming intimate. Before we got past the sensual making out stage she told me she wanted me back and things didnt work out with her ex. I told her that I had been talking with someone new who I wanted to be with and didnt want to go back to our old relationship. She got mad at this and left.       Right after she left I heard screams from outside my house and looked out the window to see what was happening. All this time I felt "quakes" like the way its depicted in movies when something big like a dinosaur walks. I looked out the window and saw a car and people in it trying to start it and get away from whatever was coming.       I never saw what it was coming towards the location but the entire time I felt it was big and it felt like a mysterious powerful force.       After that I woke up.      the other dream I had was basically just me and my ex fooling around. It wasnt just straight fooling around like with any person though it was the more intimate kind.    **** newest dream start****      Ok so I was dreaming that i was on my couch and from here I can see the door that leads to the apartment entrance area where shoes and coats are removed. I have cats so I always keep that closed so not to risk them getting out when someone enters. There is also a door right to the right of this door which leads to the main house. That door leads to a bedroom.      In this dream that door was wide open and I was looking out and watched my ex walk into the bedroom followed by her b/f and 2 other friends. I instantly jumped up and was like woh woh woh what are you doing? get out of here I dont want you in my house. She said something about it being her place to and I said Im theo ne thats paying rent and kept telling them to get out. They all went through the door that leads to the upstairs apartment and I went inside and sat on the floor where my couch should have been. She came in and walked over,sat down and hugged me and wouldnt let go. I remember thinking how odd it was and wondering why she was hugging me in the first place.       ****** newest dream end *********      I know that I have had a few more dreams with her in it lately but I dont remember any of them but I dont get the sense that they were about her as much as they had her there.      I am sure alot of people are going to say I still love her and want her back. I do still love her. We were engaged and had plans for life and she was my first love. I dont want her back. At one point she told me she believes I never truly loved her. Since then I have had a sense of freedom and felt good. I havent worried about her or cared if she was doing ok and I dont want her back. I dont even care if she is in my life or not.      As I said I have been talking with someone new who I am really interested in and there is potential for something there and Im looking forward to it.       I am just curious what these dreams could mean if anything? could they just be because my memories of her are so fresh? Could they be because she was my first love and relationship and the possibility of a new one with someone else scares me a little? Me and her were friends since grade 8 so I knew her long before we had a relationship. This other girl Ive only been talking to for about a month give or take.      I would really like any and everyones opinions on what they think these dre
