20090306163958AA2Fz7a	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	R&P: You all will probably dislike this artist.....[details]?	But what is your opinion on this kickass artist, Santigold? People label her as 'R&B', but I don't think she is. She is influenced by bands such as The Pixies and Blondie and genres such as New Wave. I heard one of her songs in Forever 21 at least twice, and I thought it was a pretty good song, considering the trash of today. She  is often compared to M.I.A.       'Creator' (This is the song that I heard in Forever 21)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXpZi4I4G...       'L.E.S. Artistes'    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCeZzW54a...

20090306163518AAc0hAo	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	The whole Rhianna/Brown incident opens up some old wounds for me?	I know what its like first hand & the moment I heard of it.  I said to myself 3-4wks tops and she will be back with him.  I don't know him personally and I already know his type.  He's sweet, caring, supportive,  a cuddler even.  Then there's a flip that switches as soon as u trust him completely,  then he smashes u down to size so u now ur place.  There was so many things he would do to me, he would tell me he would tell me he would kill my family, then he would tell me to leave, then I would walk to the door and he would say where do u think ur going.  I would scream from frustration and he would cover my mouth and my nose so I couldn't breathe.  He knew that UFC stuff, u know when they're on the ground & can hold u there by twisting ur limbs.  After it was over he would want to talk b/c he felt bad but I was so far away- my eyes were blank.  I couldn't speak, but he wanted to talk so that I could realize what I had done wrong & admit my blame.        That silly girl Rhianna is apparently saying she is partially to blame, she just young.  No matter what she allegedly said or did there's no justification -he an abuser & that wont change.  My ex never hit me in may face so that others could see, but he did so many other things I cant even explain -choking being one of them.  I hope she smartens up and presses charges.

20090306172300AAZLyPs	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Personal Training Joke-star if you like!?	Dear Diary      For my fortieth birthday this year, my husband (the dear) purchased a   week of personal training at the local gym for me. Although I am still   in great shape since my track and field days some 25 years ago, I   decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.      I called the gym and made my reservations with a personal trainer named   Damon, who identified himself as a 26-year-old aerobics instructor and   model for athletic clothing and swim wear. My husband seemed pleased   with my enthusiasm to get started!      The gym encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress.      Monday:      Started my day at 6:00 am. Tough to get out of bed, but found it was   well worth it when I arrived at the health club to find Damon waiting   for me. He is something of a Greek god - with blond hair, seductive eyes   and a dazzling white smile. Woo Hoo!! Damon gave me a tour and showed me   the machines. He took my pulse after five minutes on the treadmill and   was alarmed that it was so fast, but I attribute it to standing next to   him in his gym top and bulging shorts. I enjoyed watching the skillful   way in which he conducted his aerobics class after my workout today.   Very inspiring. Damon was encouraging as I did my sit-ups, although my   gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time he was around.   This is going to be a FANTASTIC week!!      Tuesday:      I drank a whole pot of coffee, but I finally made it out the door.      Damon made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air then   he put weights on it! My legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but   I made the full mile. Damon's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. I   feel GREAT!! It's a whole new life for me.      Wednesday:      The only way I can brush my teeth is by lying the toothbrush on the   counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. I believe I have a   hernia in both pectorals. Driving was OK as long as I didn't try to   steer or stop. I ran over the gym manager in the parking lot. Damon was   impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club   members. His voice is a little too perky for this early in the morning   and when he scolds, he gets this nasally whine that is VERY annoying. My   chest hurt when I got on the treadmill, so he put me on the "Stair   Monster". Why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an   activity rendered obsolete by elevators? Damon told me it would help me   get in shape and enjoy life. He said some other **** too.      Thursday:      Damon was waiting for me with his vampire-like teeth exposed as his   thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. I couldn't help being   a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. Damon took me   to work out with dumbbells. When he was not looking, I ran and hid in   the women's change room. He sent Cheryl to find me, then, as punishment,   put me on the rowing machine -- which I sank.      Friday:      I hate that bastard Damon more than any human being has ever hated any   other human being in the history of the world. Stupid, masochistic   gym-jock. If there was a part of my body I could move without unbearable   pain, I would beat him with it. He wanted me to work on my triceps. I   don't have any triceps! And if you don't want dents in the floor, don't   hand me the fricken barbells or anything that weighs more than a   sandwich. (Which I am sure you learned in the sadist school you attended   and graduated magna *** laude from.) The treadmill flung me off and I   landed on the nutrition advisor. Why couldn't it have been someone big   and soft, like an ice-cream salesman or a fireman?      Saturday:      Damon left a message on my answering machine in his grating, whining   voice, wondering why I did not show up today. Just hearing him made me   want to smash the machine with my rolling pin. However, I lacked the   strength to even use the TV remote and ended up catching eleven straight   hours of the Weather Channel.      Sunday:      I'm having the Church van pick me up for services today so I can go and   thank GOD that this week is over. I will also pray that next year my   husband (the bastard) will choose a gift for me that is fun -like a root   canal or a pap smear.

20090306174535AAq2Pva	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Should I be in trouble for this?	Okay so, the story goes:      I see a psychiatrist once every other week, I have some problems yada yada. Anyways I was just talking to her about how my week was going and told her I started seeing a nutrionist (bulimia)... and she asked me how that was going. And I said it was fine, I just feel like I've really messed up and its costing me like $300. And then she said she didn't realize I had to pay for it (she was the one who referred the nutrionist to my parents) and that she wanted to talk to my stepdad. I asked her about what? And she said just about me paying for the nutrionist and stuff... I said alright.      Anyways, next day (today) my parents are pissed at me for "complaining" to the psychiatrist that I have to pay for my nutrionist. Theyre mad because theyre having to pay like $1000 a month for all my medical bills and they think I'm being a spoiled brat for getting upset that I have to pay for my nutrionist. My mom's exact words: "Oh poor Shay, you have to pay $290 when we're having to pay the rest. I'm gonna just cancel your psychiatrist if your gonna keep complaining about us to her."      Should my parents be pissed at me? I WANT TO RUN AWAY I HATEEE THIS AND HOW THEY ARE.

20090306190019AAPGvaH	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I have something to share with the teens and young adults that use Y/A & I hope it's not removed, because it's?	fairly important...  And there is a question to it too.      I work @ a local High School and feel like these kids are almost like mine.   Well, today one student ( A 16yr old Junior) was taken off life support because she was declared brain dead.   A week earlier, she and many other teens went to a party that was out in the middle of nowhere. After the party, she got into a car that was specifically designed for 4 people, and she was the 5th, so with no seat beat on,  they proceed home, the driver ( we don't know if she was drunk) decided to speed to speeds upwards of 80 mph, where the speed limit was 50. She hit a bump in the road, lost control of her car, and it ended up in the on coming lane and was struck by more than one car. The girl without a seat belt was ejected from the car and struck by yet another car... For a week, her family and many many friends hoped for the best, But sadly, she never woke up.      And because of this girls' one bad mistake in judgment, she lost her life, and many others will never be the same.       So, PLEASE teens & young adults THINK before you do something !      My question is, do you think it would be weird if I attended the funeral?  I personally did not know her, but I know many of her friends, and I'd like to pay my respects to the family.
20090306173256AAxvYWw	Entertainment & Music;Celebrities	Bring Michael Jackson To The USA Project?	I know there are allot of fans who wanna see MJ in concert who cant afford to fly to London,      In the meantime we want to let him know how much we want him to perform in the USA.We need to prove that his fans in the usa have not gone anywhere and love him just as much as his overseas fans do   I believe that with your help we can make this happen, but we have got to get serious about it!       I am a team member for MJSUNIFC and we have contacted the L.A. Times since that is where MJ lives now and we want to place a full page add, and it will cost between $15,000 and $60,000, depending on which day of the week we choose. So our minimum goal is $15,000   I know it probably seems like a lot of money, but when you really think about it and break it down for what we are trying to accomplish it really is not.   All we would need to reach the minimum goal is an average donation of $5.00 from 3,000 fans. There are some Michael Fan Clubs out there that have more members than that in one club!       if you would like to help, please make donations to      MJSUNIFC   P.O.

20090306181759AA6nTU4	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Friend won't pay back money she owes me! how to do i deal with it?	Ok it started back in December when all our friends were out at a gig drinking.   We end up sort of getting separated because some of us ended up leaving with guys and others kept going to the bathroom or some had to leave early.   Anyways,   I went to the gig with my "best friend" before we even got there she had told me to bring my camera since she doesn't have one so we can take pictures. I then told her if she can carry it.   Once we were there we met up with our other friends and we were drinking and taking pictures too.   Then I and my "best friend" ended up getting separated.   She left the whole gig with some guy and I didn't see her for the rest of the night.   The next morning when we talked she told me that she didn't have my camera that before she left she gave it to another one of our friend to give it to me.   That one friend was also with another guy.   The "best friend" said that the other friend didn't seem that drunk.   When I had talked to the other friend she said she didn't remember anything about a camera. And that the "best friend" never gave her anything.   The guy she was with said the "best friend" never gave the other friend a camera also.      Since the begging the "best friend" said she would buy me a new camera.   Well she kind of had to at least the way I saw it. I did let her borrow it.      Now it’s been over 3 months and I still have not seen any money. I really need a camera now so I keep bugging her about my money and she won't pay.   She said I have to wait till April which is when her mom will get her taxes.   I’m getting piss. So are my parents.         What should I do now to get it back?   Should I talk to her mom about it? Have my parents talk to her mom?   Is it worth losing a friend over this?   Am only asking for $270! I don't understand how they can't come up with that after 3 months!      The "best friend" doesn't have a job by the way.

(a) going clubbing into the wee hours of the morning   (b) getting so high and/or wasted that you don't remember what happened   (c) going to see a movie and/or shopping at a mall with a few close friends   (d) a nice dinner out with your significant other (or a few close friends if you don't have a s/o)   (e) pulling an all-nighter...studying chem in the library, while talking with friends (a low pressure all-nighter, meaning there is no test coming up)      which one would you choose?      thanks in advance for all your answers. :)
20090306180946AAd2HxO	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Is it normal to find chemistry lecture to be...fun?	today I was in my physical chem lecture and I realized once again that I find it to be sort of entertaining.      one of my good friends is in the same lecture with me and we sit right at the front of the room. the lecture theatre has these soft cushioned seats so it's really comfortable. and the front row means that leg room isn't an issue. so we just lean all the way back in our seats and basically recline. this also angles our heads more upwards and gives a better angle to see the projected slides (on the screen). so basically, it's like leaning back in a movie theatre and watching a movie on a big screen in front of you...a movie about acid-base equilibria and the Haber Process.      I am a self-proclaimed nerd, but I think I topped myself today when I found physical chem to be more interesting than the average movie, which usually puts me to sleep.      so, is it normal to feel this way about chemistry lecture? is there any class that you're so interested in that you find it this engaging?      thanks in advance for all your answers. :)

The show "Trading Spouses" gives each family $50,000 but the mom from the other family decides how it is spent. I was just wondering if there is a legally binding contract that prevents the families from spending the money that is not the way the other mom meant for it to be spent. I just watched an episode where the other mom gave $2,000 for a piano and the rest of the $48,000 to the little girl of the other family to receive upon her 18th birthday. Are the parents obligated to spend the money that way (they were poor and could have used that money for repairs and bills)?

20090306172140AA2wg6n	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I think I made everyone hate me!!!! I tried to cancel prom!!!?	When I think of prom I think of a bunch people going and hitting on each other and then going and drinking and having sex. I don't care if there's going to be a prom, but I hate to see so much money wasted on that kind of activity. Today the prom planning commitee was having a meeting. I went in to the meeting and asked them if they would be willing to consider either cancelling prom this year or next year to donate the money to charity, or to maybe make prom a little smaller sot that the money could be given to charity or to the school which is short on funds. They instantly saw this as an attack and started listing reasons why this was impossible, and now I've been accused of trying to "ruin prom" and that sort of thing. I think a lot of people in school are pretty mad at me. Did I do something wrong? All I wanted was their opinion on the matter, it's not like I can force them to do anything. Out class raised way to much money for prom anyway. Do we really need a $5,000 party where all the kids who thing they're cool go and be inapproporiate with each other? Is that more important than our school running out of money, or children in foreign countries starving to death? We can't even spare a cent to help some other people?

20090306174135AABuaHx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	I'm 15 and my voice cracks and is unsteady when I sing, and I also have trouble with pitch. Is this temporary?	My voice has been changing for a good amount of time now. It is low, but still cracks and screeches, especially when I sing and try to hit high notes. My voice is also unsteady. When I record myself singing and then listen back, I notice that many times my voice seems to wobble or quiver. Lastly, I'm have trouble with pitch. I have a decent ear and can hum back any note, but when I try and sing it, it's really difficult to match it right away. Rather, I have to find it. My voice isn't doing what my brain wants it to do. I just wanted some insight on the topic. Will this resolve itself? Will my voice settle in a definite range? and will my pitch accuracy problems go away when my voice is done changing?

I have seen so many questions posted about them, the stupidest ones are:      "Should Tina Turner talk to Rihanna?"   "Should Rihanna go back"      Between 33%-50% of women are beaten by their spouses daily. Why does everyone make it seem like this is not typical.      Everyone says she should not go back to him, and she shouldnt.   But most women run back, and she a normal woman. She just has money and her life is exposed to the public. She is human.      Opinions???

Instead the person had a pair of discs on right under his shoes, and attached to those were the wheels, skate-board styled ones going sideways relative to his feet.      Is this something that's widely available now, or was this person just recycling a trashed board into something odd?  It literally looked like the discs the wheels were attached to were attached to his shoes too.      Just wondering.

20090306220315AA6HJEz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Irish Oldies - Rate 1 to 10?	Into a Belfast pub comes Paddy Murphy, looking like he'd just been run over by a train.   His arm is in a sling, his nose is broken, his face is cut and bruised and he's walking with a limp. ''What happened to you?" asks Sean, the bartender..   " Jamie O'Conner and me had a fight," says Paddy.          "That little jerk, O'Conner," says Sean,     "He couldn't do that to you, he must have had something in his hand."   " That he did," says Paddy, "a shovel is what he had, and a terrible lickin' he gave me with it."    "Well," says Sean, "you should have defended yourself, didn't you have something in your hand?"    That I did," said Paddy. "Mrs. O'Conner's breast, and a thing of beauty it was, but useless in a fight."          **************************************... **************    An Irishman who had a little too much to drink is driving home from the city one night and, of course, his car is weaving violently all over the road.    A cop pulls him over.   "So," says the cop to the driver, ''where have ya been?"   "Why, I've been to the pub of course," slurs the drunk.    " Well," says the cop, "it looks like you've had quite a few to drink this evening."    "I did all right," the drunk says with a smile.   "Did you know," says the cop, standing straight and folding his arms across his chest, "that a few intersections back, your wife fell out of your car?"   "Oh, thank heavens," sighs the drunk. "For a minute there, I thought I'd gone deaf."         **************************************...    Brenda O'Malley is home making dinner, as usual, when Tom Finnegan arrives at her door.    "Brenda, may I come in?" he asks. "I've somethin' to tell ya".    "Of course you can come in, you're always welcome, Tom. But where's my husband?"    " That's what I'm here to be telling ya, Brenda. There was an accident down at the Guinness brewery..."    "Oh, God no!" cries Brenda. "Please don't tell me." "I must, Brenda. Your husband Shamus is dead and gone. I'm sorry''.    Finally, she looked up at Tom. "How did it happen, Tom?"    " It was terrible, Brenda. He fell into a vat of Guinness Stout and drowned."       " Oh my dear Jesus! But you must tell me truth, Tom.    Did he at least go quickly?""Well, Brenda... no. In fact, he got out three times to pee."          **************************************...    Mary Clancy goes up to Father O'Grady after his Sunday morning service, and she's in tears.    He says, "So what's bothering you, Mary my dear?" She says, "Oh, Father, I've got terrible news.    My husband passed away last night."   The priest says, "Oh, Mary, that's terrible. Tell me, Mary, did he have any last requests?"    She says, "That he did, Father." The priest says, "What did he ask, Mary? "   He said, ''Please Mary, put down that gun...''          **************************************...    AND THE BEST FOR LAST    A drunk staggers into a Catholic Church, enters a confessional booth, sits down, but says nothing.    The Priest coughs a few times to get his attention but the drunk continues to sit there.    Finally, the Priest pounds three times on the wall.    The drunk mumbles, "ain't no use knockin, there's no paper on this side either!"

LOL i'm sure that it made perfect sense while i was writing it         Whisper      Something is detained from the outer layer.   Sometimes I feel it surging,   Singing deep within my veins.

20090306214215AAd7iP6	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	PLEASE HELP!!!!!!!! I need an answer?	I am writing a book with my best friend and we have come across a dilemma. One of our main characters is going to get married to another one and we can't decide who. The two people are Katie and Ali. Don is the one that one of the two have to marry. Here are the stories.      Katie and Don went out when they were teenagers for a short time, but Don was really immature and they broke up. Both of them still liked each other but Don kept nagging Katie and messing things up. But they are pretty much in love in a kind of love/hate way.      Ali and Don met when they were about 15 as friends and then 4 years later they met again and it turned out they had heaps in common. After a while they started to date and really liked each other. And they got on really well.      If Katie marries Don, then Ali won't be in the story much and Don and Ali's kids (who we have kind of created already) won't exist.      If Ali and Don get married then Katie, who is one of the main characters, will be sad and die alone. She will also fade from the story.      Please help, give us an answer- Katie or Ali, and a reason for your answer. Thanks in advance!! Please!

We still remain friends afterwhich. The break up was not those drama type.      Recently, I offer to help my ex move his stuffs to a new house and it was raining heavily, and we are both drenched to wet. He treated me dinner and drink.      I also accompany him to buy furnitures for his new house thus giving alots of good advises and he 's very happy with my idea of rearranging his furnitures.      When i was with him, he was staying at his old house and his old house is very old and filthy, thus his mood is always not good.      But now, things seemed to have change, his new place is new, fresh and comfy and I had gave him alot of good ideas regarding his new house.      Recently, he seemed to changed his attitudes towards me. He had became more affectionate and caring than before. He started to bring me out more often than before.      Last time , when we are dating, i always ask him to meet my mum but he always said no, but now he came down to my neighbourhood and meet my mum and said hi to her.      Is he into me again....?      What say you?   and what shall i do abt him?

20090306190711AAhM8lW	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Girls, this is the OTHER part to the story thingy, that cut off. :D?	I sat in my room the whole entire day. I grabbed my phone, and opened it. 17 missed calls; 1 voicemail. I listened to the voicemail, pressing my phone up against my ear hard. "Ash... I am so sorry... I didn't know... You didn't tell me... You never acted like it... Please, don't hate me... You're my best friend... Dakota said no... She didn't date "Emo" guys, apparently. That made me laugh. She thought I was "Emo". Anyways, I'm really sorry, Ash... I think... I love you too... When I hear your voice, my heart lights up. When you laugh, I can't help but laugh too. When I'm with you, I can't seem to be sad. I'm always... Happy. You're one of the most beautiful girl I have ever met in my entire life. You have a wonderful personality. I remember that day, when I was new in 7th grade. You were my first friend. Then you introduced me to our other friends. Now we're closer then ever. I'm sorry, I knew you didn't like Dakota. What was I thinking? I feel like a bastard, an idiot. I'm sorry, Ash... I love you..." his voice stopped, then the voicemail ladies voice came up again. I closed my phone shut, and layed down. Is he lying? Or is he telling the truth? I let out a huge sigh. I heard a knock on my door. "Yes?" I said, trying to sound as normal as possible. "Ashie, Jayce is here to see you." my dad said. "Tell him I'll be out in 3 minutes." I yelled, feeling nervous. "Okay." he yelled back. I heard his footsteps go down the hallway. I walked over to my desk, and looked for a small comb. I found one broken in half, and used it anyways. I fixed my hair a bit, and applied a bit of makeup on. I walked over to my door, and opened it. I tiptoed to the corner slowly, and peeked out to the side. Jayce was sitting on the couch, his face looked sad. I stopped acting weird, and walked over to him.    My eyes fluttered open. I looked around. It was just a dream? I grabbed my phone and opened it. I checked to my recieved calls. No Jayce. I laid back down. I couldn't cry anymore. If he doesn't care by now, he's not worth it. I bit my bottom lip. I got out of bed, and walked out the door. My mom and dad were sitting on the couch, watching TV. "Hey, Ashie." my dad said, smiling. "Hi dad." I mumbled. I dragged my feet across the floor and sat in the seat next to him. "So, your mom and I was just talking about you a few minutes ago... She said she saw you running back to your room and crying a few hours ago... Is there anything you would like to tell us? We could help you." he said, sounding concerned. "It's nothing. Just hormones." I said, standing back up. "Ash, I left your dinner on the table just in case you were hungry." my mom said, smiling at me. "Thanks." I whispered, walking over to the kitchen. I looked at the plate of food, and looked away. But then I looked at it again. There was a napkin with letters on it. I picked it up and read it. "Ash, I know I'm not your real mother, and you may not like talking to me about your personal issues, but I've been with you for 11 years. You're like my own daughter. So if you want to talk to me about it, I'll be reading in the study room until 11:30. - Mom" I stared at it. I stuffed the napkin in my pocket, and walked back to my room. At least someone cares.    I stared at the clock. 10:23. I sighed, and stood up. I opened the door quietly, and walked down the hallway. I stopped at my parents room, looking inside. My dad was asleep, but no one was on his side. I walked out to the study room. Just as she said, she was sitting on the chair, reading one of her boring books that she tells me I should read one day. She looked up, and smiled. I walked over to her, and sat on a small chair. "So what's bugging you?" she asked, staring at me. "Well... Mom... Did you ever get a feeling when you were younger, not that I'm saying you're not young, but when you were my age, and you thought you were in love with your best friend?" I asked slowly, staring at the floor. "As a matter of fact, I did. His name was Will. But I never told him. And you know what? He got married to this girl I hated alot after we graduated high school." she said, laughing. "How's that funny?" I asked, my face scrunched up in confusion. "Because what if I got married to him? I would never be here with you and your father, would I?" she said, her smile even wider. "I guess... But I mean... I want to tell him... And I did... But I don't think he... Feels the same way." I whispered, holding back tears. "Is this boy you're talking about that guy who always comes over? The one with the black hair, that is always incredibly huge, which makes you and him look alike? The one that always wears clothing tighter then people did in the 80's?" she said, laughing at her own joke. "Yes... His name is Jayce.." I said, hiding a smile. "Well hun, guys who wears tighter clothing then you isn't worth anything. So don't worry about it, okay? You have your father and me. That's all you need." she said. "Thanks..." I smiled at her, "I love you, mom."

Maybe they are going to show it at the beginning of DH, idk but seriously. And I know they cut Dobby and Kreacher, which in my opinion is not smart. Dobby has been cut since the second and he is such an important character. =[      Anything else going to be cut? Anyone have any ideas?      I just hate scenes being cut out! I think the movie is going to be great of course but still, the 5th one was disappointing for me; too many scenes cut out.  Give me the 5 hour movie! Not 2 hours of rushed scenes!

I am paying to see a movie based on the plot and content, not for the sex. If i wanted to see sex I'd go watch some porn. It's disgusting how now people think its fine to show such nudity. I was appalled by a movie i saw a couple weeks back, when I was flashed by a nude male body. It is disgusting. What happened to good clean movies that everyone loved to watch. I can't watch most of the new movies with my family, because there is sex in them. What happened to the movie industry?

20090306215216AAY2kc8	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Is this a flaw in Watchmen?	After having read the book recently and seeing the movie tonight, I noticed something that didn't seem right.  If Ozymandias was trying to frame Rorschach for the murder of Molech, why would he use a gun?  Ozymandias is the smartest man in the world, but killed Molech in a manner completely inconsistent with Rorschach's M.O.  First, Rorschach never carries a gun.  Second, a single bullet wound in the head is much to neat for a Rorschach job.  My opinion would be that Ozymandias would have used a different method for this murder if he wanted to frame Rorschach as convincingly as he was capable of.      Any thoughts are appreciated.

20090306215935AAumUvQ	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	How do I sing better?	Recently, I’ve been trying to get better at singing. I really enjoy it, but I’m currently so bad, I’m embarrassed to sing in front of anyone else. I really want to get better.      I have a very nasally sounding voice- whether I’m talking or trying to sing. I also sound like a girl when I sing. (When I say girl, I mean typical wispy and weak damsel in distress from a standard fairy tale- it’s not pretty… well, not from a boy lol)      Does anyone have any tips? I’ve tried some different stuff I’ve found online, but it all either doesn’t work, or makes me sound wispy, and more girly. Who knows, I might have been doing the exercises wrong; most of them are hard to understand.      I’m 20 now, so I don’t think my voice is going to get any lower at this point. I want to be able to sing higher songs anyway. My lower singing voice is nasally to the point where it’s creepy… and most songs I want to sing are fairly high anyway. I just really need some way to make my higher singing voice not so girly.      I have tried singing stronger, and it helps a little, but I usually end up having to force those notes out. From what I’ve heard its not good to force anything out.      It really bothers me. I sing along with songs preformed by boys. They still sound very masculine at that pitch, I just don’t. It’s not like I’m trying to sing soprano opera parts either… just mid to semi-high ranged tenor.      And I know I actually sound as bad as I think. I’ve recorded myself, and have very low expectations. I want to get better… at least a little… but I don’t want to pay for a formal teacher.      So now that I’ve babbled on… I’ll summarize what I’m asking…      How do I sing high and not sound like a girl?   How do I sing and speak less nasally?      Thanks

20090306223658AAiCq3n	Entertainment & Music;Television;Other - Television	What tv show is this clip / description from?	The youtube clip:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZQw62cxw...       A late 80s/early 90s TV show for children with puppets and a live human male      It had a segment called "flying pictures" where kids could submit pictures   and the man would show them all with a song playing (they were usually pictures of characters from the show)   "pictures, flying pictures, red, and yellow, blue and   green and white. Pictures, flying pictures, little shapes   go by. Flying pictures in the sky."      There was also a bunny named Leelabee who sang a song   "Everything grows in leelabee's garden and I think   I know why. 'Cause all the plants here in Leelabee's garden   Have tenderness and love. And higher and higher the    vegetables grow. Sweeter and sweeter the smell of the roses."      There was also a horse that the man talked to who was a   puppet. And two buzzards (ones name I believe was buzz) who commented on things   from their tree above. There was also a man they   went to see who taught how to draw a specific thing   that day. Such as draw two circles, one big one little,    and it would turn into a kitty as he added detail.      Most of the characters were puppets, but the main host was a real live person. Maybe a farmer.    I think he was dressed like a farmer, and he had all of these animals around him, which   I believe were on a farm. Especially since he used to go up to the fence to see the horse.         It was my favorite show, and it's driving me nuts. HELP!!! I've submitted multiple questions asking if anyone knew.      I can tell you it isn't the electric company, the imagination station, Lamb Chop's Play-Along - THE FLOWERPOT MEN      Eureeka's Castle - Binyah's Surprise Snuffle Puppet show;   Paperplay, Penny Crayon,       Because all of those were suggested, and it's turned out none of them were it.      I can tell you that in the southeast USA at one point in time it came on at 1 pm on what I believe was PBS.   I remember because it came on at the same time as Day's of Our Lives. I believe that would have been in 1990-1993 range.      I've looked for years on youtube, google, yahoo, asked here on answers. If anyone has anything that might be able to help me, PLEASE      Thank you in advance.   1 day ago - 3 days left to answer.   Additional Details   TEN POINTS TO BEST ANSWER.       (if you even have a suggestion of somewhere I could look...even if you don't know the name of the show. Or even if you've heard of or remember the show and can prove i'm not crazy, lol)   1 day ago      On RETROJUNK.com several other people remember this show. And they remembered the horse's name is buddy. There were also other songs.      He did have a song with the verse:   Buddy, Buddy   You're a real good buddy of mine      And this was perhaps part of the same song, or a different one:   Great day in the morning   Everything's all right   [. . .]   Now, I don't care if the sun don't shine   We're gonna have us a real good time   Whether sunshine or pouring rain   The bottom line is still the same   1 day ago      and no..sorry...it's not pappyland

I just watched Amadeus, and it portrays Salieri as an insane, evil old man, who was just a mediocre composer.       I have plenty of doubts about the validity of this movie, but in terms of his music what do all of you think?
20090307010812AAnH8sY	Entertainment & Music;Music;Classical	Could you play lute music on a violin (pizzicato)?	I played Prelude for Lute in D minor by Bach to a friend of mine, she liked it and asked me to get the Violin music (Of course this was ignorant of her, but I agreed to get it for her.) Now, of course the music I have is for the lute, so would I get her to play it bowed or pizzicato? And if pizzicato would it sound better as just normal pizzicato or "pizzicato quasi  guitara" like in  the 4th movement of Rimsky-Korsakov's Capriccio Espagnol?

When I texted Sunday he called back and asked me to see him/have dinner when he gets back from a trip in a week   4. I have since sent him texts and he has not responded.

20090306231724AA53VPA	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	A blind man walks into a resturant?	A blind man walks into a restaurant and sits down. The waiter, who is also the owner, walks up to the blind man and hands him a menu.       "I'm sorry sir, but I am blind and can't read the menu. Just bring me a dirty fork from a previous customer, I'll smell it and order from there."       A little confused, the owner walks over to the dirty dish pile and picks up a greasy fork. He returns to the blind man's table and hands it to him. The blind man puts the fork to his nose and takes in a deep breath. "Ah, yes that's what I'll have, meatloaf and mashed potatoes."      Unbelievable, the owner says to himself as he walks towards the kitchen. The cook happens to be the owner's wife and he tells her what had just happened. The blind man eats his meal and leaves.       Several days later the blind man returns and the owner mistakingly brings him a menu again. "Sir, remember me? I'm the blind man."       "I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you. I'll go get you a dirty fork."       The owner again retrieves a dirty fork and brings it to the blind man. After another deep breath, the blind man says, "That smells great, I'll take the Macaroni and chesse with broccoli."       Once again walking away in disbelief, the owner things the blind man is screwing around with him and tells his wife that the next time the blind man comes in he's going to test him. The blind man eats and leaves.       He returns the following week, but this time the owner see's him coming and runs to the kitchen. He tells his wife, "Mary, rub this fork on your panties before I take it to the blind man." Mary complies and hands her husband the fork back.       As the blind man walks in and sits down, the owner is ready and waiting. "Good afternoon sir, this time I remembered you and I already have the fork ready for you."       The blind man puts the fork to his nose, takes a deep whiff and says, "Hey! I didn't know that Mary worked here!"      "STAR IF YOU LIKED"

Also if I could name a few others I really despise Nirvana and I think Zeppelin is okay but overrated. I wish people on Yahoo can see the light and agree with me. The answer is obvious that Nickelback is the best band! Well I think they rock.       I appreciate bands like Green Day, Aerosmith, Metallica, Bon Jovi, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and Def Leopard. I just think there much better coordinate rock bands.       I must INFORM you, I'm not being sarcastic. I just have good taste in music. Nickelback fan for life.

20090227060732AA8GifJ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	How do I approach this delicate topic to my neighbor?	I live here in the Phoenix area and I am a single 34 year old guy which makes this even more difficult. My neighbor has a pool in their backyard (with no fence) and has a son who is 15 Chris and a daughter Lindsey who is 14 and in the 8th grade. Recently I am guessing the parents were not at home and Lindsey appeared to have about 5 girls from her class over, they all looked like 8th graders and I went to the backyard to my tool shed and they were all skinny dipping including Chris. I couldn't believe they were doing it. It was Lindsey, her friends and her brother Chris all naked. I ran back in the house. I dont know what they were thinking even though I am the only house there as our two houses are isolated. Why would they do that? How should I approach the parents? I didnt call the police cause it only happened once. I just couldnt believe I saw 6 naked teens out there. I being single and male dont want to get myself into trouble making any accusations. How do I hande this? Should I just ignore it or just tell the parents?

After seeing Watchman last night, something seemed a bit askwed with the conclusion. If your not familar with the movie... Adrian, one of the masked villains sets up a plan to blow up half of New York to unite the Soviet Union and The United States to a common enemy. The nuclear talks between united states and the soviet union presented a threat to humanity.      Realistic? A borderline yes. It is too brutal and inhumane to be the best decision. I just wanted some feedback for alternate solutions. I don't disagree with the decision (only if it was the worst case scenario)... but I feel like there was another alternative without killing 3 million innocent people.

It could be age issues or self-image issues or any number of issues :P    But whatever.      I don't think I need "encouragement" because either way, I'm d*mn well going to do whatever it is I *want* (within reason blah blah) and that I *can*. So... I think it's more about not wanting to feel like a weirdo. Not overwhelmingly worried about what the world thinks of me, but 'uncomfortable' or 'out of place' wouldn't feel too good, either.      Personally, I think I would get an occasional quizzical look and nothing more.

Do you think great minds think alike, or does Dr. Dre listen to Del in his free time? Either would be cool to me.       And I'm not even proposing this question for ya'll to bash Eminem's song, because even though it's kindof an Em-single song, I think it's alright. The way he says "Tahooe" makes me laugh everytime. If I had to pick one I'd rather jam too, I'd probably go with Eminem's song. Dre's production on top of the (*cough* stolen) sample is still supurb.

Yes most of the dancers on are professional dancers but most didn't appear on other another dancing show.

20090307123228AAkQ63Z	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What happened to the classic rock "sound"?	OK, so here is my thoughts.      Classic rock is one of if not "the" most popular genre of music, especially among those ages 35 and up.        You would therefore think that any band that wants instant fame would merely have to write their own songs and mimic the classic rock sound within these songs.  Everyone I know is always saying how they wish classic rock would make a comeback, do bands and producers not see that there is a HUGE market that is unsatisfied with current music?  By bringing back classic rock there would be a TON of money to be made.  All that is needed are      1.  songs that tell stories, actually makes you think about the meanings behind them and what the song writer was "on" when he wrote it.      2.  A singer with a raspy voice.      3.  A break in every song to allow for a solo which then links back into the song.      4.  All band members can play their own instruments.      That is pretty much it.  Seems like these record folks are missing out on a huge market 35 and up.  And it is funny since these people usually have better jobs and can afford to buy lots of cds.

20090307113416AAXkN8l	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Questions about the difference in chest/head/falsetto voice?	I've always loved to sing, but I never thought I was that good. One reason for that is that I'm an alto-a low alto at that. Recently, though, I learned that it was possible to extend your range, and I've been working on that.    When I reach the A/B above middle C, my voice 'breaks' and goes into this airy tone which I think is falsetto. But how do I know that the airy tone isn't my 'head' voice? I don't feel any break from going from my lowest note to the A/B, which makes me think I'm still in my chest voice.    Help?!    Also, I'm wary about posting a clip of me singing. I don't know, your always told that posting a pic. of yourself is a big no-no, you know, rapists and murders are always on the internet..O_o

20090307144856AAe2UQN	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	This week in review (joke)?	This week in news:   The woman attacked by a 200 lb chimpanzee has been transferred to a new hospital and is slowly recovering from having her lips, nose, eyelids, and hands ripped off by the enraged primate. When asked about whether the monkey was going to be put down, authorities said that all he needs is a good spanking.   Speaking of monkeys who need spanked, Michael Jackson has announced that he plans a comeback. In dire need of money after filing bankruptcy and having his Neverland Ranch foreclosed on, Mike has joined forces and become the new spokesman for K-Mart new “Blue light special”. Mr. Jackson is excited about getting boy’s undergarments half off.   Initial reports came in that the earth was only 48,000 miles away from being hit with a three mile wide asteroid, capable of killing millions and changing the face of the earth forever. At first it was thought to be nothing more than a close call, but as it turns out, the asteroid did in fact cause one casualty, as it hit and completely destroyed Joaquin Phoenix’s acting career.   Search and rescue for two former NFL players who were lost at sea after their boat capsized has been halted. Many people have wondered what type of boat the weekend fishermen took out into the water that day. Coast Guard officials only know one thing about the make. Due to the fact that the boat’s owner was a member of the 2008 Detroit Lions, there is absolutely no chance that it was a Four Winns.   The girl who had her feet severed at the ankle during a 2004 trip to Six Flags amusement park has been fitted with her second pair of prosthetic feet, and now at 17 years of age, has lived a normal life. This is exceedingly good news due to the fact that she was injured on a rollercoaster named “Superman”, and therefore was lucky not to be paralyzed from the neck down.   Initial reports are in stating that the new economic stimulus pack has allowed thousands to return to work. Unfortunately, most of these people are illegal migrant workers, as they remain the only people willing to return to work for $13.00 a week.   Revelers decked out in sequins, feathers, wigs and leather danced through the streets of Sydney on Saturday to the cheers of more than 300,000 people at the annual Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras. More than 130 floats and 9,500 people participated in the procession, which began as a protest march in 1978 by homosexual and transsexual men and women and has flourished into one of the world's largest and most flamboyant gay pride events. "I am totally in my element," said a transsexual who identified herself as Gummi Cat. "This is my first year being in the parade and I am absolutely loving it," he/she said from a carriage pulled by a man dressed in little more than a black leather harness. Sorry, no joke here. If that vision enough isn’t enough to make you laugh, nothing I say has a chance.
20090307144629AA3xyfr	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What's your favorite Indie song?

20090307144403AAALUBR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Could use opinions please?	I don't know which one to work more on.    I want to specialize in either singing or growling.      Here are the pros for each one.      Growling/Screaming:  I LOVE metal music!  I love how they growl and it's just amazing!  It sounds fantastic.  I am sometimes an angry person and I feel the need to scream!  (Look up Kyo from Dir en grey, listen to his vocals.  His range is amazing!  Which is how I became a fan!)   I can growl/scream a bit but very limited.      Singing:  I like singing because it's soo soothing and relaxing!  It sounds peaceful and sounds good as well!  I want to be a woman's lover and be able to sing to her whenever she is down or anything.  I can sing a bit too!  I have more of an opera voice but I want more of this voice:       http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6giOH0FHx...       My voice is too bass-y and I want a calm voice like his.           What do I pick?  What are you opinions on this?      please no insults -__-

20090307144559AAktaLf	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Purple fly (be sure to read the moral of the story)?	One day Billy was sitting in his 2nd grade class when his friend Tommy passed him a note. Righht as Tommy gave it to him the teacher yelled    "BILLY Come Up Here And GiVe me that note"    The teacher read it and yelled @ Billy to get down to the principals office right away.    The principal was talking very nicely to Billy before he asked him what the note said. Billy then told him PURPLE FLY. The principal then yelled"Get out of my school you little bastard!!!!!!" Billy then walked home and told his mom that he got kicked out of school. She of course asked why He said "Well.... Tommy passed me a note,teacher took the note sent me down to the principals office and then the principal sent me home"    "Well,,, what did the note say?"    "Purple fly"    "GET up to your room young man , your father will deal with you when he gets home!"    Billy went up to his room and kept thinking about what the heck PURPLE FLY meant. His dad finally came home and aked him what happened.    Billy said "well dad... Tommy passed me a note, Teacher took the note, sent me down to the principals office he sent me home and mom sent me to my room"    "Well son what did the note say?"    "PURPLE FLY"    "Get out of my house and NEVER come back you little brat!"    So billy left his home and became a bum.    Ten years later he was sitting in a ditch with another bum. The other bum asked Billy what went wrong in his life that made him become a bum.    Billy told his story" Well.. when I was in 2nd grade Tommy passed me a note,teacher took the note,sent me down to the principals office. principal suspended me, moom sent me to my room,and my dasd kicked me out of the house and told me he never wanted to see me again"    The other bum asked "what did the note say?    "PURPLE FLY"    "What the hell does that mean?"    Just as the bum asked that Billy saw Tommy across the street and said"Wel you know I never found out but there is Tommy across the street. Why don't you go ask him?"    The other bum got up to cross the street and BAM he got hit by a bus.       Do You Know The Moral To the Story?    .............    .........          .............    .............             ..............    .............    ..............       ...............       ........    ........    ............       ..........       MORAL: LOOK BOTH WAYS BEFORE YOU CROSS THE STREET!       ( I have absolutely no idea what Purple Fly means)

So I am going to be singing for the first time in public on the 26th for my school's coffee house (it's just a talent show pretty much) and the song that i am doing is untitled by simple plan (i am an alto-tonor) and me and my friend friends have our audition on the Wednesday and there is this one note that i can't hit in the song (it is a high d if anyone knows what that means i don't read sheet music that well). now we do scaled to warm up and i can hit the note then and i can even go from the lowest note (or any note for that matter) and hit that note almost all the time but I have only hit it about 3 times in the song and it is really frustrating and i don't know not to fix this. i am pushing a diaphragm and dropping my jaw and nothing. i need this fixed anyone got any ideas

20090307143901AAUzfNG	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	How do you decide which active EMG pickups to use?	Everyone knows that the most popular pickups by EMG are the active humbucker models 81 and 85.  They sound different from each other, but each pickup also sounds different in different guitars, and in different positions in the same guitar (neck vs. bridge, for example).  I see the 81 in the bridge position of most guitars, but sometimes it's an 85.  In the neck, it can go either way.  So, if I'm retrofitting a guitar with EMGs, how do I decide which pickup to use in which location?  What characteristics of the guitar and my intended goal would determine this?
