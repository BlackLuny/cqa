We just want to know some different ways to experiment with each other without getting any other people involved. We just want to experiment one-on-one. We are both girls if you haven't noticed. We are both 14 also. Please don't give us any stupid or perverted answers like "I don't know but can I watch" because we have never experimented before, and that's disgusting anyway. We have already tried kissing and that kind of worked out but what are some other ways to experiment with each other? Also have you ever experimented and how old were you and what techniques did you try.

I'm 15 and I don't want to sound like that kid that complains about their family and over reacts, but i don't know how much more i can take. My dad is an alcoholic, and my mom is just a controlling *****. In my family of 5 (i have 2 younger sisters) I'm put in charge of yardwork (which i don't mind) my grandpa's yard, and cleaning up after everyone in my family. This wouldn't bother me if it wasnt for the fact no one can clean up after themselves in my house and my mom makes me do the majority of it, none of my parents do anything. I need some place to stay but i can't think of one. When i was in 8th grade i was suicidal due to my dad's drinking, we don't really talk anymore. I can't stay with my grandpa because he always takes my mom's side, can't stay with friends because i don't want to mooch off their families, and i can't stay outside because its about 20 degree's. What can i do?

20090225125028AAEV8am	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would it be best to tell her?	Last semester this new young female chemistry professor taught one of my chemistry classes and initially I had a crush on her because I thought that she was cute. We become close because I was dealing with low self esteem issues and unlike other teachers she was willing to help me as a student by allowing me to talk to her and others on campus.  As a result I continued to make the dean's list and I got an A in physics.  However for some reason this semester even though I try to not to think about her she keeps running through my mind.  I even had two dreams about her.  As her student I dont want to have a dating or sexual relationship with her because she  is my teacher.  I also dont want her to get mad or hate me or avoid me outside of class if she feels uncomfortable with fact that I like her.  However I feel that I need to be honest and tell her how I feel because this crush has been bothering me the whole of last week to point where I cant even understand.
20090225124932AA9ZFUB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Well I cut it off with the single mom...was it the best choice?	I was dating a single mom of 2 kids whos 24 and im only 20 and i broke up with her just now for good cuz i dont want to be tied down at a young age and i want to enjoy myself before i commit to anyone, i want to enjoy my college years and not regret settling down young and i realized this after we had a 24 hour break up. So we talked things out this morning but i wasnt feeling it ne more...she tried using her little one year old son against me saying i walked out on his life and all this but I realized yesterday when i was single that i feel free and that i have the whole world ahead of me to settle dwn and next year im going to Arizona State and there will be plenty women there and i just wnt to live my life without worrying about someones kids. do i feel bad about the kid? yes but hell b ok. My dad kept telling me that by being with her would be a big mistake and it wont turn out good. I am not ready to settle down and i realized that yesterday. She was talking all this ish about me. I just dont want to end up marrying someone at such a young age and regret it because i didnt enjoy my time alone and college lif, she was a GREAT GREAT woman and keeps tellin me im gonna regret losing her and all that but hey there are plenty women out there im gonna meet without kids. everyone kept telling me this from the beginning and it took me a whole year of being with her and taking a 24 hour break that im not ready for that. Am I wrong for doing that cuz there are kids envolved? but they are not mine and i have to think about whats best for me

There is this girl I was checking out. She was with a guy, I assume he is her boyfriend. Okay, I know she saw me checking her out. So a few minutes later they both come and start working out on the machine next to me. I gave her some eye contact and a quick smile. After that, when they were both looking at me, I lifted my shirt slowly and flashed my chiseled abs for her. She sort of just stared for a second until she came to. Then just looked away really fast. Her boyfriend was just standing there like "wtf..." I want both male and female perspectives. I'd prefer female perspective though.

20090225125538AA1tclP	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would it be wrong to ask for a second wedding if you didn't like the first one?	When my husband and I married I didn't like the wedding. It was done on the fly by his mother and nothing was as I would've wanted it. I had no bridesmaids, no maid of honor- while my husband got to have a best man and groomsmen. Also we had some crappy reception in the basement of a church I didn't like. It was semi-embarrassing. Also it happened less than a month after I had our son, so I wasn't in peak physical condition either, if you know what I mean.    Not that I wasn't grateful for him mom planning it, but in the end it was a day I'd rather have forgotten and that wasn't how I wanted to remember my wedding day. So would it be wrong to ask for a second wedding since the first one was so awful?

20090225125735AAGiSaM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is your take on this?	My boyfriend, he is very protective of me. He gets jealous very easily. When I speak to another boy he asks what we were talking about.       My boyfriend is very good looking; with an even better body. Now as I said before he gets very jealous.       F/e: He got upset of how a guy was all over me and didn't want me to say the guys name. Kidding around, I said the name three times over. He than said, because I am very insecure about myself and he insists I am hot, that maybe he should go back to his old gf. He started saying how hot she was and other stuff about her and him. I got upset, and he than tried to make it right by saying it was just a joke.      We tell each other everything. Although we've only been together about 3 weeks. We know everything about each other. Now, yesterday I called another guy hot and many people heard me. What if they tell him? They would do that. Should I tell him before they do? Because I called many other people hot yesterday.       I'm just afraid he'll take it the wrong way. What should I do?         *He's Hispanic, and you know how they get/are with their women.      *I'm Hispanic too.      *He keeps thinking I'm going to leave him for this other boy.

We talk about everything, we do everything together and we have been sexual with one another for the past two years now. Im not seeing anyone and he isnt seeing anyone either. We have tried dating other people but the relationships never last. I have expressed several times lately how i felt about him. I have let him know that i was always inlove with him and just never knew how to tell him. He has expressed to me that he has feelings for me also but still only looks at me as a friend. So after him saying that i have backed off. I am totally stop having sex with him. I tell him sometimes im busy when he wants to hang out but still he insist on flirting with me. He always trying to be up under me. He still calls me and text me everyday all day!!! I dont know what to do or think. He tells me one thing but shows me another. I guess what i need to know is do you think he is scared? I dont want to cut off our friendship because he is a very good friend but if he arent going to be together i need to get over this man. We cook together, wash clothes together, have drinks together, take our kids out together, introduce me to the ex wife, and when i get sick he even tries to take care of me....Please help me understand why a man would do all this but still says i only look at you as a friend. Sometimes men can be so damn confusing!!! Any advice???

She has never moved out of my grandparent's house. She stays in bed all day. She works part time at a pet store. She holds a job for about 6 months an quits. She goes to the doctor all the time, even when there is clearly not ill. She finds reasons to go. She never finished high school because she got pregnant with my cousin. She has had many abortions (I don't know the actual number but I know it's more than 8). What is she going to do when my grandparents pass away and she has to support herself? No one in the family will take her in. I'm definitely not going to because I know she will never move out. Everyone has tried talking to her to get her motivated but she will try something for a week and then quit. She doesn't even have her own car because she won't save her money. She blows it all on cigarettes and doctor bills. What would suggest to our family to help her grow up? Help!!

I use to live my grandparents who fought verbally and physically (using other objects to throw at each other) and a mentally disorder aunt who denied of it. It was hell in that house for 4 years, and I wished I could have died then living in that torn apart house of terror. I cried somedays, and I felt like I was mentally depressed. I was hit by my grandfather, and threatened at times. I was at such a young age too (9-13) My mom and dad was working in a different state, and they wouldn't let me come live with them. I'm guessing they didn't want extra baggage (me) :( I'm 15 now and Im living with my parents for once, but they are discussing about me going back to that hell house. I DON'T want to go back, and they don't understand why. They tell me I was being rude to my grandparents because I don't want to talk to them. Any help please? I really don't want to go back ;(
20090225130455AAAlhPs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	In a world that truly wishes to rid itself of inequality, why are the following true?	If the world were to truly want to develop and foster a truly egalitarian society for all, why are the following situations still permitted under law (each by nature automatically exclude a certain group)?      1. If family services takes the children away from the mother and put them in foster care, the father is still required to pay child support, but not the mother. The mother is allowed at any point during her child's life to financially walk away from the child in the instances of abortion, adoption, abandonement, or seizure as stated above, yet a man is held financially responsible in each of them with the exception of abortion.      2. Laws passed specifically to protect women, children and infants (by nature excluding men).      3. The small business administration that doles preferential loans (funded by taxpayer dollars), specifically to women and minorities ( excluding against caucasians and men).      4. Shelters and organizations made for violence against women (often paid for by taxpayer dollars), which if you look in any city, you while find several for women, yet in Los Angeles, the second largest city in The United States, you will find none for men.      5. Custody awarded to women on a far more frequent basis than it is to men, even when the men request custody.      It would be possible to cite examples of inequality all day long, yet I have named a few of the more common ones and I am curious why these injustices are both, socially and legally acceptable by people who claim to want equality?
20090225125813AAweX0h	Family & Relationships;Family	I'm going to confront my mom and dad about my childhood? I was molested when I was little.?	I told my mom when I was 13 but she told me I was a liar and I never got any help for it. I don't remember who molested me but I know it happened. She was also very cold hearted to me as a child. I was singled out, kind of like the black sheep of the family for a very long time until my older brother moved out. My mom favored him and basically whatever he said went and whatever he did was ok. The only reason why my mom and I have a relationship now is because my brother wont talk to her because she cut him off from the family funds and my mom and his wife do not get along. It's like since my brother couldn't use my mom anymore he wanted nothing to do with her. I feel as though my mom took the frustration she had with my older brother out on me. Instead of punishing him she punished me instead. My mother is a very good manipulator/liar. My father is a sailor and was gone for a good majority of my childhood. He has no idea that things were the way they were.       Every time I have tried to confront her in the past she says that I am ungrateful because she has done so much for me. And by that she means, bought me toys, took me to school, fed me, clothed me, etc. It's not that I am ungrateful but I feel when you decide to have a kid (or open your legs) you have an obligation as a parent to provide those things for your children. I am angry because she puts the blame on me even though I was the child and she was the adult. She controlled the situation and I did not. I need to confront her because I feel as if its an important part of me getting over my childhood and not being so angry.      For people who have confronted parents in the past for things that they have done, what did you do in your situation? Any advice anybody can give me is greatly appreciated.

Long story short, i let him borrow my muffler(scarf) and he wore it and everything. It's been months and he still hasn't given it back. I told my friend to ask him to give it back and he told her that he wants me to ask him.....what does that mean? why is he making things so hard when i just got over him.         i know it was long, but thanks for reading(:

20090225130502AAMzzAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does she have a boyfriend?	So there has been this girl that we go back and forth, I like her and then she likes me but I have a girlfriend then she has a bf and I like her and it never seems to work out.      We have known each other for forever and friend zone problem never played in cause of the type of girl she is, she wants her boyfriend to be her best friend      anyway, last time we "had something" I chose another girl over her, cause at that time I felt the other relationship would be better for my point in my life, however over the course of a year that didn’t play out.      I know she dated a two different guys over the summer but broke up with them both and we hung out a little but I lead a crazy life and barely have the time to go see her when I do (which she doesn’t understand but that’s a different story)    We stopped talking a week or so after thanksgiving when I blew her off for a holiday party and recently started talking and hanging out again (spent all of Valentine’s Day just chilling and what not)      However, since around thanksgiving time, or maybe before, idk, she has been talking to this guy who lives more than a day’s drive away (friend of a friend or something).  Like from what I heard through the grapevine over the phone, webcam, things like that like at least every night      but when we hung out she didn’t mention him at all to me, even when I ask her things like "what you do with your free time" and she responds "draw, school and sleep" so idk      my working theory is she is but doesn’t want to scare me away with it or something OR she isn't, I am supposed to hang out with her tomorrow so hopefully ill figure it all out   So what do you all thing?

20090225130248AAMK2wv	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I cope with running over mine and my son's cat? I can't get over it.?	Yesterday, I went to back up in my driveway, and ran over something. Immediately, I thought it might be a cat, but doubted it. I've lived in the same house for 15 years, and its never happened to any of our cats with any vehicle. I asked my son if he left any toys in the driveway, and then I got out of my car and saw our Siamese cat, Stella (who we adopted about a year and a half ago), jumping around, going crazy, with her eyes bugged out, and (what I can only guess) were parts of her brain smashed out through her eyeballs, and blood was squirting everywhere. She was bouncing up and down and everytime she did, blood would shoot out of her and all I could do was scream and cry. It was a horrifying scene. It all took about 10 seconds, but it felt like forever. She finally stopped and died. God I hope it was just her nerves making her jerk like that. It was so greusome. My 6 year old son jumped out and saw it too and started crying, I ran over to him and just hugged and held him so he could not see her, but he had seen enough to know. He was very upset and so was I...to the point where I was screaming and throwing up in our yard. The cat was old I assume. The only thing that I can think of, is that she didn't hear the car, because of her age. My son...he is doing better now. He played a baseball game shortly after and seems to be fine. I wrote to his teacher to let her know that I would like him to see a councelor to talk about it. As far as myself, I don't have time to see a councelor. I'm a single mom and I work all of the time. How can I get MYSELF over this? I just keep playing the scene in my head over and over and over. I can't stop crying.
20090225130020AAnYgoW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband and I fight all the time now?	My husband and I have been together for 9 years. We have 3 children, and just found out 2 days ago that I am pregnant again. He doesn't want the baby. He makes me feel like I'm a lazy bit2h and do nothing, when that is quite the opposite. He is really into swinging and doing things sexually with other people. I am starting to resent him so much that I feel we should separate. He is far from supportive with this pregnancy, and I have just had enough. I do love him and I planned on staying with him for the rest of my life, but it looks like our relationship is going to end a lot sooner than I thought. Anyone have any advice? Thank you

20090128132250AANbHjM	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm so upset at my friends? Please help ?	I have been so depressed lately because I am constantly surrounded by two people who say they are my friends. The issue is that one of them is very self centered, inconsiderate of other people's times, and could possibly be a user. For example I invited her to my b-day party, she said she was going, the day of the party she never showed up so I called her to see where she was at and she said she didn't want to go anymore because she wanted to sleep. She does that crap every single time you go anywhere with her. She calls my friend in the middle of the night to help her with math problems because before than she had to nap and is now wide awake unconcerned of whether or not she is waking my friend up. Also she gets mad when ever my friend can't give her a ride home or gives her any food. Also when she found out a guy had sex with my friend, she said "why would he want to do you? wow I thought I would be the first person."       The other friend of mine I have known for a 11 years and I now realized that she will only talk to me when ever the first chick I mentioned and another chick isn't around. While she stands around me she always complains on where the other chicks are at and usually just about any small conversation we have, she calls me stupid.       I really want to get away from both of them but they are part of the group of friends that I have. So I would have to deal with it either way and I think it would get worse if I tell them that I don't want to be friends with them anymore. I really don't want to deal with it anymore and I feel so sad because I feel like they see me as a person that is below them. I can't be around someone who isn't treating me as an equal. I have no idea on what I should even concider doing. Please help?

20090225132046AAzOZzS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is being friends with this person wrong?	Basically, my mum used to be a psychiatric nurse. She nursed a patient a long time ago, a good ten years ago. Let's called the patient Amy. So Amy moved on and my mum is now no longer a psychiatric nurse. Anyway, Amy has now got in touch with me of facebook. I knew my mum was special to her because she's kept christmas cards from her and also I remember she made me and my brother little gifts when she was under my mum's care (I was just a kid back then).      She seems to really want to meet my mum, or at least speak to her, but my mum doesn't want to... probably because she belongs in Amy's past or whatever. Should I keep talking to Amy? I don't want to hurt her feelings. Also, she seems like a really nice girl. But it kind of feels like I'm betraying my mum by talking to her but I have reason to. I mean, my life is mine and mine alone and I can see who I like. It's not like I want to arrange a meeting with her and Amy.      How do I get across that my mum doesn't want to be in contact with her without hurting her feelings? Also, am I betraying my mum by keeping in touch with her myself?
20090128115604AA5kQ81	Family & Relationships;Family	How can you stop caring what an overbearing mother thinks of you?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship. Part of me doesn't believe in love..that it's just a silly human emotion designed by nature to get us to pro-create. I've never had a desire to have sex..again I think I'm kind of too good/intelligent in the sense that it's just carnal pleasure. Are these feelings normal?   I think society puts too much emphasis on relationships..what's wrong with staying single?   Granted, I am depressed, but I don't think this depression has anything to do with not being in a relationship. I'm in college and just stressed out about not knowing what I want to do with my life. I have an overbearing mother who is constantly telling me how I should have a good career.      I only really have one or two good friends. I have a hard time becoming close to people.   Growing up my parents always fight, so I don't really have a good relationship model to go by.

20090225130921AA6UCD6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is He Trying To Play On My Sympathy?	He sits and talks to me for hours about his past. He told me that he was molested when he was 11 years by his sisters 16 yr. old friends. He's told me all about the 2 years he spent in jail. He tells me about his current relationship with his live in girlfriend and how he's planning to leave her and move in with a friend because he can't take it anymore. She's controlling and possessive. He's experiencing erectile disfunction so we can't even have sex because he can't get it up, no matter what I do.      Why is he telling me all these things? He was soo secretive at first and now he's spilling his guts to me as if I'm his therapist. Is he trying to play on my sympathy to get me to feel sorry for him? I'm pretty sure he's vented to someone about this stuff before he's 30 something years old. Is he playing on my sympathy or how should I take him being soo emotionally open with me right now?

20090128120431AA9qyjA	Family & Relationships;Family	My mum and dad argue and it is horrible?	my mum and dad do argue quite frequently sometimes, they use to argue all the time, it has gotten better, but when they do argue, it can be very violent and just horrible, my dad had to get arrested once due to assault against my mum and sister, that night was horrible because i was the one who had to keep them away from hurting eachother, but i wasnt that successful they were both drunk and he nearly killed her! im scared it will happen again, so i always get scared when they argue, what should i do?
20090225131540AAljSPs	Family & Relationships;Family	Why so much trouble with my mother?	Sometimes, I find it difficult to deal with my mother. When I end up doing something wrong she keeps telling on me, a hundred times a day, that I'm not as capable as my friends and with my indolence, I won't be able to afford my life in university. She often shouts when I don't have zeal in housework, because she wants me to be a more practical, than theoretic person, as a keen bookwarm person  I am.    It's not that I don't like to commit in housework, but I think sometimes it's a waste of time, especially when I have other more important things to do.   I really get embarrassed when she shouts at me, by taking examples of my zealous mates that help their mothers and don't stand all the time reading or in front of the monitor.   I should admit that I am a bit unsocial to these types of things, but I think this is because I have more perspective as compared with some of my friends.    How can I deal with her and make up her mind that what I really need is working with myself, because a cruel world, whom I have to face with, crawls out there?    She still keeps telling me that I'm not liking at all to be "down-to-earth" and this is why I'll find it hard to succeed in some things in a year's time, when I'll find myself surrounded by strange people(in University). So, what's the best thing for both us at this moment, when only months keep us along?   I'll take into consideration your advice!

A friend of mine came down to visit, and she said I would get along great with a guy friend of hers. She gave him my number and we txted till 5am... We have been talking everyday since for atleast a few hours at night...      Shocker when he said he likes me, and I like him. We get along great, he have the same humor, we are really compatible, yadda yadda yadda...      ANYWAYS... when we are on the phone our convo will be great and we will be laughing and joking and just talking... but then we seem to run out of things to talk about... Or there will be a dead silence for a few minutes.... I dont know if its just me, but with my previous bf or friends, it always seemed like the conversation was a constant flow, we never ran out of things to talk about. We talked about anything and everything... And if there was a silence I didnt mind just sitting there, knowing I was in their company.       Have we just not gotten to that comfort level with each other yet? We havent talked really deep about anything, its just been about a week and a half. Should I just give it time...??       I'm just a lil confused, because I've never really had this problem of not finding things to say. Any advise would help! Thanks :)

20090225131843AA0DtMz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does it seem like this girl might actually be interested?	ever since my bitter divorce, where i was emotionally abused, cheated on, she got pregnant by another guy, robbed, and held my kid captive, i have had a hard time trusting in a girl liking me. anyway, i took this girl out for a date and she said she had a great time. she told me to call her. so later that night i text her saying i had a good time, hope she did too and hopefully we can do it again. she said thanks, i had a great time. so come 2 days later i called her and she answered. we talked for a bit and then i asked her out again. she said yes. we will be going out on our second date this friday. the only thing is i dont know if she will really go out with me. i think she might blow me off. girls, is it possible that a girl will text you back after you text them, answer her phone when you call, and say yes to a second date even if she isnt interested? how come im worrying that she will blow off the date?
20090225131051AAuR89W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Gentlemen, what does it mean when you make cheeky, sexual comments to girls?	What does it mean when guys make cheeky, sexual comments when there was no sexuality in the conversation beforehand? Example, we'll be talking online on a game (yes, we're both nerds >.<) and his character will be only wearing bubbles as an outfit.  I said, "Ha ha, nice bubbles." He responded, "Like to see what's under them ;)"      And don't just say that he likes me or not, go into detail. Is it "he likes you and wants to date you" or "he considers you an option but isn't actively chasing you". Think to girls in your life you've done this to and think if there was ever a time when you weren't interested in her and you made comments like this, and this number in comparison to the number of girls you've liked and made comments to.      So basically, I am asking what are the chances of him not liking me when he makes unprovoked sexual comments.      Oh, and also how I should respond.

20090225130909AAQs2Ev	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you deal with a mediocre marriage?	Let's say it's not great but it's ok.  There are no major problems, no rules broken, but you just don't really connect.  Day to day you get along, but there isn't any fire.        I've tried all the romantic stuff, I've tried helping around the house, I've tried scheduling dates, and we've being going to counseling for 3 months.  My wife doesn't want to talk about it but she seems angry about something and I can't seem to get her attention.      We've been married for 12 years.  It was fun a year before the kids were born, but after that she just wants to be a mom not a wife.

Ok, so I really like this girl and I used to talk to her everyday (usually the Hey, whats up deal). 2 years later, I hardly ever see her and when I do, either she or myself are the in a rush. I want to approach her again, but im the shy type. When I talked to her, i felt a sense of confidence. Now I feel that she's out of my league. I can't get her out of my head and wondering what kind of techniques I should try. Ive heard get her number or facebook/myspace/etc. But I feel it's kind of tacky to get to know her on that.      Plus, don't give me any jive like "Just talk to her!", Ive been telling myself that for the last 2 years. She is one of the most beautiful girl ive ever met and It's just really hard for me. I'm afraid I will lose her.

20090225131802AANaFU9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	We decided to go our separate ways............?	My ex and I were together for over 2 yrs and lived together for one.  Our relationship wasn't perfect or anywhere near it but I have been crazy about him since day 1.  So we broke up because we aren't understanding each other.  He says all i do is ***** and complain and i feel unappreciated and try to bring it up and all he does is get mad and never wants to talk about things.  Of course the tension will always be there if the problems arent resolved.  He says i accuse him of being a bad boyfriend because i complain but i mean he never compliments me, he never says thank you when i do things for him and for valentines and our anniversary i didnt even get rose or a kiss or anything.....when hes he acts like a complete dick and is never sorry...i feel hes my other half and i hate it when we're mad..and now that we split i feel terrible..hes taking it very cool but i miss him so much and wish things were different...i can honestly say i did it all to make us work but he was never willing to meet me half way.....ok another thing he was buying all kinds of new clothes lately do you think part of him being cool with the break up is that hes interested in someone else?

20090225131318AA4US8q	Family & Relationships;Family	What can I do about my relationship with my mother?	I'm 21 year old. I am a lot different than my mother. She's religious, I'm not. She's 'one of the girls', I'm not. During my teen years, after my parents divorce, I guess we really started drifting apart. She has two other children now (aside from the other two she already had) and it just sometimes seems she is rather apathetic with me.       For example, this week I have been trying to call her to see when I can come visit my siblings (ages 4 and 2). I ride the bus home from college where I am picked up at her job. She never seems to return my calls or act interested in me coming home. When I do come home, she insists I spend time with solely my siblings, any want of me to spend time with her and my stepdad seems tossed away.       What can I do to fix things? I have suggested we go out to dinner and what not to talk but she rarely asks me "How are you?". I ask these questions relatively often and am very interested to know how things are going with her.    I suppose what makes me jealous is all my friends up here get weekly calls and the occasional visit from their parents. They call to hear about their classes and what not. My parents do NOT pay for my college or anything so I really feel just kinda left out.      I understand my mother has a life but so does my grandmother and they talk on the phone rather often.My mom talks on the phone a lot , she just doesn't click over (call waiting) when I call her.

20090225130948AAuNKyP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Im writing a story about a kid  that moved to LA, how do you  describe a house in beverly hills,  LA?	We pulled up and stopped in front of this striking house. The gate opened automatically allowing us to enter. The yard was surrounded by black rod iron fence and we pulled into an interlocking stone driveway. Much different than what I had imagined. We all got out of the car and we looked at our new home. It was much nicer and one billion times bigger than our home back in New York.    “Guys go on and pick your rooms.” Mum said with slight enthusiasm. We ran to the bottom of the front doorway steps. There were actually like ten doors you could use to get inside this place. We climbed the steps to one of the ten doors and stood there looking at the entranceway, knowing that behind these doors is where our lives begin. I noticed two large white pillars in my peripheral vision and walked inside the house. We didn’t bother looking at anything else, except for the biggest bedroom.

Ok, so on Tuesday I noticed my left eye was red, and a bit swollen. My friends at school told me that there was gunk in my eye. I thought nothing of it until the next day. When I woke up, my eye was still red, and it was kind of crusted together. So, i went to School, because my parents are stupid,  and they sent me home. The doctor just looked at it and said " yup, it looks like pink eye".....but didn't really do anything to test it. They gave me medicine and eye drops. Now it is Wednesday, and my eye is less red, and no gunk, and it never really itched in the first place...WTF!!! My mom is telling me to go to school tomorrow, and my friends tell me, that they will make the teachers send me home!!! DO I REALLY HAVE PINK EYE????

20090128140605AAWA9WX	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Etiquette of maid of honor?	My brother is getting married in October of this year. I am a bridesmaid and his fiance's 2 sisters are both maid of honors (she couldn't pick between the 2). My brother's fiance knows that not all of us are well off so she told us to use our own shoes, they just have to be black. Well today I got an email from one of the maid of honors saying that she thinks it is a good idea that we get the same shoes and it will be a nice surprise for the bride. The 2 pairs of shoes she picked out were $65 and $58. I am a stay at home Mom and I find spending that much money on shoes that I will wear once non-sense (I am already paying $160 for a dress I will wear once!). Was it right of her to go around the bride's wishes and tell us that we should get these particular shoes when frankly, the bride doesn't care.       I already sent her an email saying that I don't think it is a good idea because of the extra expense and because it wasn't the brides idea.

It really bothers me in a way that I was not enough for her.       She had to sneak around my back and when I think of her laying in bed with another man I just don't want to touch her anymore.  I really wish I had not got married, but I have to move on and handle this problem with ease.   All I ever wanted I thought I had and now she shattered that.

I'm continuing to lose weight and diet.  I DO NOT! want to get ring cut off.  I am wondering if anyone else has had this happen to them or knows of additional things I can try to get it off.  Once it's off, I intend to give my finger a couple of weeks to adjust before deciding about getting my ring resized.

20090128140240AAWkEta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do women prefer fat or unattractive guys?	Ok, everytime I see a guy going out with a girl, the girl might be pretty, but the guy is usually fat, ugly or both. I'm a fairly thin guy (115-117 lbs) and people generally think i'm decent looking,  even though i don't see myself as particularly good looking. Why is that women prefer to go out with fat/ugly guys over decent looking/thin ones?

20090128143304AAIRsN4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I lost a friend because of my girlfriend?	My girlfriend and I have been pulling apart for a while now. Recently we've been closer, like we were before. We've been together for a year and 3 months. Well I have a friend, a girl I'll call N, and we got close. My girlfriend thinks I like her, and I do, as a friend... and maybe a little more... Our other friend, we'll call her K, went to the movies with my girlfriend... And told her she felt sorry for her, and bad for her because of what was going on... nothing happened... I'm not a guy that cheats. I never have been. My dad cheated on my mom and they divorced. I know how bad it hurts the girl. So my girlfriend came crying to me after their movie asking if I like her and if I want to be with her. If I want to stay with her, and... Today K told me about it (their movie night was about a week ago) And I brought it up with N who made it clear that there is nothing between us... She says we shouldn't talk or hang out anymore... I know it's probably best. My girlfriend will love it, so will K, but I feel so hurt, and I'm on the verge of breaking down. I hate that I lost someone so close over K's lies. Which my girlfriend still believes. I haven't told K or my girlfriend about my conversation with N. I don't know what to do...

20090128140124AAEEZKF	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I have a very bad past how can I make it better?	My current girlfriend and I have been on and off for 4 years now. When we would break up in the past it would be for a week or two but, when we did I would go out and meet a different girl. During this time I had sex with these different girls. It sometimes would only be one time but, then at some times it would be just casual. When my girlfriend and I would get back together I would no longer sleep with that girl again. (I did use protection) Now we have been straight for the past year with no break ups no getting into fights or arguments that would cause us to break up. The problem lies here. The different girls from my past would see us together now and have a comment to say about what we did or they would give my girlfriend a dirty look. Now i look like the bad guy in this situation, am I? I mean we were broken up when this happened and it never happened again so why should she be so mad at me? I totally understand the whole fact of me having sex with her and then with them and then her again I am putting her and myself at risk but, I stay getting tested and always use protection. I just don't know why she gets so angry at me even though I have not seen these girls nor spoke to them in over a year. Any advice???

My husband abandoned me and left after 6 months of our marriage as he was overly attached with his cousin.i have a gut feeling they r having an affair.  he now lives with her for the past 7 months.    Anyways he said he does not want me in his life. so after a lot of pleading and begging for him to come back to our marriage I agreed. I found out from one of our lawyers we could get an anulment on the grounds of non comsumation. So I filed the papers initially he agreed but now when the papers are ready he said he will not sign the papers as i have mentioned his affair with his cousin as a reason of non- consummation. I really don't know what to do.  My spouse is not cooperating at all. Has anyone filed a adultery case against their spouse ?can anyonme advise me how long does this procedure take in india (mumbai).

20090128141629AANWHQs	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Son's foster brother just passed away yesterday and I'm not sure how I should tell him?	I got a phonecall this morning, I was informed that My son's older foster brother (17) passed away yesterday from a drug overdose. I've never met him before, but I do know they grew up together from an early age and both lived with the same family, and my son has also told me about him.       I haven't told him yet...He's been so happy with life lately and I just don't want to break his heart by telling him the news. This is going to really hurt him and I know it, from what I know they were quite close until I adopted him last October and they haven't talked since then. Another point that might make things even worse for him is that his mom before me was a meth addict...He died from a meth overdose. There has only been bad memories with my son and his other mom, she was abusive and neglectful, and from what I heard would go insane when she wasn't high.      What would be the best way I can approach him with this, and help him cope with this?I'm a single mom, so I'll have to give all the support I possibly can. He's sensitive and he's also still only 14, I know this is really going to be hard on him.

Before my and my ex friend became not friend anymore, she told me that she was raped, but the problem I am having with this situation is that she didn't say no or anything. She told me that when she was drunk she was pretending to be sleeping to see how far this person she was with would go with her. They didn't have sexual intercourse I guess he was just caressing her. She said she was fully aware what was going on and she told me that she didn't say no or tell him to stop, but then the next day she told me that she was raped by him because he touched her. So would you say she was raped.

Then, awhile later (maybe half hour or so) he came back and gave me his number, saying he realized that I didn't have it - and we talked for a few more minutes.  I am kinda confused - I really like him, but it is hard to know what his intentions are.  Should I call him, and if I do - what should open up with? What do you think his intentions are?

20090128140920AAIGwN9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would lead someone to jump all over you about everything instead of having calm, rational discussions?	My husband is horrible about talking about something.  Everything can be fine in my eyes one minute and the next, I say something that he doesn't like (like my mother is doing this or that or that I was planning this or that) and he's down my throat.  He gets so mad right away about situations that could be resolved with a little calm talking.  It makes me crazy because it's usually really stupid stuff that he's super upset about.  How the heck do you deal with someone like that?  I usually end up getting snippy because I don't know how to be calm after he's gotten so mad so quickly.

20090128141035AAnz640	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would you do about this craziness?!?	Okay, here's the deal. Try to keep up as this can be absurd at times. My younger sister and her husband have been married for 5 years now. Her husband has a sister that is about the same age as me..28. Well, my step-dad who is 49 (my sister's real dad...we're half sisters i guess you could say) is SLEEPING with my brother in law's  sister!!! I know that is sort of confusing, but I am serious! My sister's sister in law is sleeping with my step-dad. Weird. Now, as an added little tid bit, my sister's sister in law is married and has a child. Her husband does not know about the sleeping around part...but everyone else in my brother in law's family does, minus his dad and nobody is happy about it. This all greatly disturbs my sister, who is pregnant and stressed out any way! I think she should write an anonymous letter to the sister in law's husband and let him know what is going on here. My sister wants to put a stop to all this but doesn't know how. She has tried talking to my step dad about how she feel and he told her, "either you're with us or against us. you don't have to be a part of our lives together." What do you suggest doing here?

20070119074807AA3KJu2	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What's wrong with good manners?	The concept of chivalry was born from the desire to help and protect those considered weaker. I am in perfect health and am stronger naturally than most guys that lift weights daily. (I only lift once or twice a week).      So, I give up my seat and open doors for everyone. Who knows who is sick that day or just finished chemo?      My wife has a big problem with this. She says:      #1: Only women are deserving. I say, why not be courteous enough to let anyone sit that feels they need to?      #2: That according other women chivalrous treatment is wrong. It's OK to stand or open a building door.      But, I should not open car doors for other women, help others with a coat, help others get seated, etc. These things should be reserved for her only.      I believe all people should be treated with good manners.      We've gone round and round on this.      How do I convince her that good manners are deserving by all, male, female, wife, UPS guy/gal, co-worker, or stranger.

Is it because they are so social and are approached by guys so frequently, that they learn to ignore and forget a lot of stuff?

I'm 16; This is my first girlfriend(16) and we've been together for a few weeks and I'm thinking about touching her butt.  I'm really nervous about it and I don't know what to do...      I don't know when to do it or how to really do it.  Should I do it while he are hugging? Kissing? or during a special time, like a dance..?      (There is a dance coming up and I'm not sure if I should do it there while we are slow dancing or not. Well should things like this be something done in private? )      Should I talk to her about it first? I don't even know how to bring up something like this in a conversation... how can I bring this up?      I do respect her and would really hate to ruin my relationship with her because I touched her... I don't know what to do...any help with first time experiences?

20090128140100AA8opVh	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is post-breakup regret natural?	After 3? years, we felt we should break up.   Her feeling was stronger in the end,   but I to was not completely happy with 'us',   and I would wish for more.   We both wanted to end it, but now I regret it, and wanted to go back.   She refused and told she is happy.      I am not completely happy with myself and insecure/low self esteem about my self, and I think this is what makes me want her back, as well as simply missing her and still like her.   And yet I felt tired of the relationship,   but now I feel terrible and want her back.         Is post-breakup regret natural?
20090128140125AAwtPmI	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friend is ditching me! Any suggestions?	Hi all! This is kind of a long story. My best friend and I dated for two years, then I wanted to move on, and we broke up, but remained very close friends. He has a new girlfriend now, which I was a little upset with because I KNEW something like this would happen because he did this when he was with me. He is with her constantly. I am not a huge fan of his girlfriend because she gets on my nerves, but I will hang out with her some of the time. But I miss the times that he and I just would hang out. Even for a few hours on a weekend or something. We are both adults here. But he never hangs out with me anymore. I have talked him repeatedly about this issue, and I just get brushed off, saying he doesn't have time and he "rarely" sees her. Which is untrue, he sees her on a daily basis. So I need help. Should I just suck it up and deal with having to hang out with her all the time, stop hanging out with him because it seems like he doesn't want to hang out with me? I am so frustrated!

20090128142135AAC6XTM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating with my best friend?	I know this is going to sound awful and it's wrong. I am married but recently I've been talking to my husbands best friend who is also one of my best friends. We talk everyday (online/one the phone/email). Our relationship had grown and we started talking about sex and touching. A few days ago we actually went further. We both felt very guilty about it and he said he realized that he really loves his girlfriend and wants to ask her to marry him. I feel bad too but in a way I don't want it to be over. We've still been talking everyday -- that hasn't changed but we're trying not to talk about sex. He has mentioned to me several times that we can't do anything again because it's crossing the line. My marriage is not good or I wouldn't have cheated in the first place -- and while i know I should have broke it off before I had done anything that isn't what happened.  While what happened made me realize I'm not in love with my husband it's seemed to do the opposite for him. I get confused because you would think he would try and stay away from me but he is the one that actually calls or writes me. Maybe he just isn't interested anymore.  I'm confused.  I don't need people telling me to end my marriage b/c I already know I should -- I'm more curious about what you think my friend thinks of me?  If he is still interested.

20090128143258AAzM7Hy	Family & Relationships;Family	What are some ways I can deal with being the family scapegoat?	My mom and I are the family scapegoats.  Everything and everything that can happen to my family is our fault in some way.  Several times, we've even found ourselves blamed in absentia.  My maternal grandmother leads the charge, but it also comes from my grandfather, aunts, and cousins.      If my mom makes a decision they don't like, it's my fault.  I "made" her make the decision somehow.  I remember them starting this when I was probably 7 years old and it's gotten steadily worse over the years.  I tried to speak out once and was soundly backhanded and told I was "ungrateful."      I have been choked, slapped numerous times, and issued more insults than I care to remember.  According to them, I'm brainless, worthless, and useless.  I have no applicable life skills aside from being a slacker and mooching off my mom.  They call my mom fat (something they tell her regularly), clingy, lazy, overbearing, and refuses to let me grow up.  My grandmother comes up from Florida and basically issues a polite command that we will have her over.  While she's over, if she doesn't get the information she wants to hear, she'll start sneaking to our bedrooms and going through our personal possessions.      I'm looking at moving out of state to put some distance between myself and the abuse.  In the meantime, I still have to live with these people in my life.      What are some ways I can deal with this sort of dysfunctional family type?

I recently sold a very rare Jar Jar collectable to be able to afford the operation and now I can't find a doctor to perform it. I have done the research, and with extensive surgery I can resemble Jar Jar. I believe this is what I need to turn my life around. I have been very depressed lately, because I have had a tough time finding a girlfriend. I have been wearing a Jar Jar costume as I walk around town and interact with others, but I feel it would be more effective if I actually was Jar Jar and not just wearing a costume.

I started going out with this guy Jan. 30th, It was great for awhile, and then I had sex with him, I don't know if it's just me or if it really is him, but everything he does annoys me, He talked about children and I may possibly be pregnant by him, But I asked him if he really knew what he was getting his self into and he said yes, then I ask him if he was going to get a job to help raise our child and he said yes but he didn't want a "career" and he didn't care if he didn't make that much... Which really bothers me because I have goals I want to have a good life without financial problems, His parents raise their kids and use them as money makers, they lie and act mentally challeneged when getting tested for SSI just so they don't have to work.

20070330105834AAISjcp	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Aide! Ma mère a quitté la maison?	Ma mèra a quitté la maison, il y a une heure. Il se sont mariés depuis 18 ans. La famille les voit comme un parfait couple. C'est ce que j'avais cru moi-même au début. Tout avait était changé les dernières années. Les conflits sont plus fréquents qu'avant et ma mère semble devenir plus fragile: elle s'énerve facilement et  elle n'accepte pas vite le regret, même quand elle n'a pas raison. Quand j'essaye de la calmer, elle m'accuse d'être à la coté de mon père. Elle dit qu'il ne tient pas compte de son avis, de ce qu'elle aime, même de sa présence. Elle est fachéé à cause de la voyage que j'ai fait hière avec mon père. Nous lui avons demandé de nous accompagné deux fois. Hier le matin, quand nous lui a redemandé, elle s'est éclatée et elle a dit que nous ne respectons pas son avis(qu'elle n'a pas exprimé). Mon père était faché donc je n'ai pas voulu lui demandé d'annuler la voyage. Aujourd'hui, elle a demandé la divorce. Mon père l'a ordonné de ne pas quitté mais elle l'a fait. Quoifair

20081106223028AAUNMHR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a right to be upset over this situation?	My best guy friend is now questioning his sexuality. He asked his girl friend (who he's in a long-distance relationship with) whether he can have sex with men, and she agreed that he can.   He says that he will always have an emotional bond with his gf, and that all he cares about is personality.      At the beginning of college, he had an open relationship with his long distance gf so he could have sex with other women. He would use the pull out method and asked the women if they would get an abortion, should they become pregnant. So he basically just used women for sex. This leads to believe that some part of him is very much straight...   so I'm thinking he's just bi.   We're in college..so I guess it's good to figure his sexuality out now.      He's not definitely going to have sex with guys..but if he finds a guy, then he will.      i don't care that he might be gay and I think its good that he's exploring...I just feel like he's using people and has used people.      He told me that it would be much easier if I had a dick, so then he could just do me. What a great complement.   He thinks I'm sexually repressed and he wants me to go to a sex shop with him to get some kind of toy.      Strangely enough, he's never put any moves on me.

Je donnerais une valeur aux choses, pour ce qu'elles signifient.   Je dormirais peu, je rêverais plus, je crois que chaque minute passée les yeux fermés représente soixante secondes en moins de lumière.   Je marcherais quand les autres s'arrêtent, je me réveillerais quand les autres dorment.   Je donnerais des ailes à un enfant, mais je le laisserais apprendre à voler seul. J'enseignerais aux vieux que la mort ne vient pas avec l'age mais avec l'oubli.   J'ai appris tant de choses des hommes …   J'ai appris que tout le monde veut vivre au sommet de la montagne, sans savoir que le véritable bonheur c'est dans la manière de l'escalader.

20081102200702AAaP4TQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Really missing my ex ):?	Okay we've broken up before and it was like the same thing, but we got back together after two weeks   its been almost two months since we broke up last, after 6 months of dating   at first, i broke up with him and it was a mess, i basically got turned against him and he wanted to get back together but I didn't want to   so for about a month, we just were in the middle I guess you could say   he was really hurting but I wasn't   well, then we kept on talking and kind of fighting, he was telling me he still loved me and I said that too   it was a mess haha and then one day he just said that he thinks we should stop talking   and he's really good at that, just stop talking to someone but thats my weakness   sooo i agreed and then after like a day, I gave in and crying, I texted him to please talk to me and how i miss him but he didn't reply   that made me mad so I forced myself to just quit him   I was strong for two weeks and this is the third week since I've talked to him and now I'm just going downhill   I've been dreaming about him every night, I saw him on halloween and he was with his friends, and he saw me and just stopped and made them avoid me   I texted him last week asking him if we were EVER going to talk and he didnt reply   it just really sucks because we were each other's firsts and so I know I have that emotional attachment to him   it just sucks but what do you tink is going through his mind?   does he still miss me? ughh   I just feel so helpless and everyting reminds me of him and I just want to cry ):

(none of this is bragging, it's jsut showing the complicatetness of the situation) I am what you would call a jock. I am one of the best players on my football team. I hang out w/ all the "cool kids" and I am really popular and all the lots of hot girls try to get to me. But I am not that kind of person. I like nice, proper, sweet girls, not sluts that are more popular than nice girls. This girl named Katie is my dream girl. shes funny, smart, kind, gorgeous, and best of all is religious and a churchgoer. Shes what my friends call a "loser" because shes hangs out w/ the "losers". apparently a loser is one who doesn't drink or party. I guess that makes me a popular loser cause i don't do either. shes knows i like her but she has a bf in her group of "loser" friends. how do i get her bc/ i know she's not that happy w/ him. what do i do? it's so hard bc/ we're both in a completely different group of friends but i know she wants me and i want her. what do I do? girls that know plz respond

20080706212019AAY2kI0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please help! I'm "lusting" for a player?	i don't know if i worded that but you get what i mean lol. at first i thought i loved him but the thing is i haven't actually talked to him for real before so people tell me it cant be love. Anyway, i see him in the hallway and when he looks into my eyes its like my heart just melts i know it sounds corny but its true. even when he's around a bunch of girls, he still looks at me and whenever i think ill see him in the hallway, i get really nervous and self-conscious. Then one time i was walking and he managed to get in front of me and purposely dropped his sweatshirt and had to bend over and pick it up right in front of me. But the point is, i fell for him in the start of the school year and now summers halfway over but i still cant stop thinking about him. I know he's a player-everyone knows it, but how can i stop thinking about him? my heart is aching because i don't see him anymore in the summer and when i picture him with other girls. (which i know he's with)

I don't know where his father is, because he has a bad drug problem and disappears every once in a while.  We aren't together and haven't been for while so I don't ever rely on him ever.  I am also not the type to EVER ask for help.  I can't stand when people ask for the single parent discount on anything.  Recently, I tried to get food stamps and they said I made too much.  I work 40 hours a week and get paid $10.00 an hour.  I am not even close to rich and more on the struggling side.  I just am curious how they can figure I made too much?      If I wasn't trying my hardest and just didn't have a job would they be more willing to help me if I was unmotivated?  The people I see that can work, but choose not to seem to always be able to get the help they need.  I am not trying to scam the system at all.  Just a hard-working mother...  any suggestions?

I enjoy drawing, painting and anything where I can be creative.      I dislike most school subjects except art class.      I am extremly messy and disorganized.      I dont like when people touch my things.      I am shy but love to be the center of attention.      I hate watching sports.      I like my clothes to match and my hair and make-up to be perfect.

20070707010914AA7lYW6	Family & Relationships;Friends	The death of a friend.?	My friend passed on almost a year ago and afterward, I felt really guitly.  We were really good friends in highschool, but went our seperate ways for college.  We tried to keep in touch, but never really happened.  I'm not feeling as guilty anymore, but still get really upset over little things like not being able to see her for our reunion, seeing people that look like her, ect.  I know I should try to think about all of my good memories with her, but everytime I do, it ultimately ends up a picture of her in the casket.  I guess what I am asking is when does it get easier, and what can I do to help accept the fact that she's not comming back?

My bf is catholic but only goes to church on xmas and easter. i was with him for 3 months on easter n that night he started talking about religion. he started talking about me being "the one"and i should go to cathlocism classes and we have to be married in the catholic church-I am christian UCC.all of the sudden he was saying we'd never live together b4 we're married and he's now waiting for a sign from god to have sex with me (what kinda sign exactly) which was strange bc we had talked about that b4 and he had said he was ready to have sex with me.I thought maybe he was just renewed on easter and it would die out bc this came outta no where.I went to his family reunion and met his priest.he said his priest had told him to join the seminary years ago but he didn't want to. I observed a weird interaction with him and his priest and then when I was introduced it was almost like his priest was shocked or disappointed that he had a gf.he broke up w me a week later no explaining. thoughts?

20070611121014AA6CaWJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Will things between me and my girlfriend work out?	I'm 15, my girlfriend is 18. We've been together since September, 06, so about 9 months. She recently told me last month, that she's moving to Texas. I was heartbroken. She thinks the relationship can still keep going until she graduates from highschool (She was in 11th grade this year, so she'd be a senior next.) in which case after she does so, she could move back to Virginia. I want it to work, but I want opinions.. We can talk on the phone anytime we want, we both have webcams, microphones, and AIM + MSN. I've asked her for all of her passwords to every thing she uses on the internet, as so she has been given mine, and I'm going to be talking to her mother once a week to see what she's been up to (to reassure myself on the factor of cheating)     I was wondering if people think this could last until June of '08 until when she comes back down to be with me? Neither of us have ever been so in love before.. I hope it works.

She is very close to me. I gave her the topmost preference for her in my life. I like her very much. This is not like love. This likingness is like something between a brother and a sister. She is very strong in her determination. One day she told that she would never love anyone. But suddenly one day she told me that she proposed to a guy in our college. I was dumbstruck by this incident. But that guy rejected her. They were very good friends before this incident and they became more good frnds after this. Suddenly I felt that my importance is decreasing in her view.      I told her one day abt all that I felt. Then she told that both are equal to her. I even planned to stop talking to her. But I am unable to do that. I dont wanna lose her.      Now whenever she tells me about him, I really feel something very bad, to be fact I am getting depression. Please guyz help me sort this problem out...      Please dont tell me to stop talking to her.

Apparrently, there's a 'mental barrier' that I must vault before my life can be normal again.  Should I date just to date?  It seems hollow to me.

Mas agora dessa ultima vez foi foda ... eu o levei pra cave do meu apartamento pois era uma fantasia nossa.Ele me colocou toda nua e eu apenas lhe passei os seios e boca la no dito cujo uma vez,ele me levantou logo e me virou de costas,me penetrou e quando tava ainda entrando ele tirou logo e gozou no chao... eu fiquei muito frustrada e imagino que ele tambem mas nao sei mais o que fazer..se eu toco no cara ele goza...

20090225080231AArkufJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Our 14 year old daughter currently lives with an abusive mom... help!?!?	I am the Stepmother of three children ages 12, 14, and 16.  They currently live with their biological mother in Washington State.  Their Father and I live in Idaho.  Unfortunately they have been enduring horrid living conditions.  The girls tell us that their mother sells drugs out of the home, leaves for days on end while she goes and "parites".  The eldest daughter of 16 is given so much responsibility and is under so much stress she is on numerous medications for ulcers and anxiety.      Recently the youngest of 12 told us that her and the 14 year old were allowed to spend the night at a boyfriends house while the mother was away from the weekend.  As a result the twelve year old posted on myspace that her weekend was weird and she felt raw.      We have called CSD and all they did was send them a letter telling them everything we told them.  They made no attempt to enter the house to see what the living conditions are like.  We call the child support office everyday and they will not return our calls.  Today the 14 year old stated she wanted to live with us, that she hates it there and would rather be with us.        So my question is:  At what age can you decide which parent to live with?  Is it even possible when the mother gets full custody?  Can you provide any website links we can use as a reference??      Any help or advice in this situation is greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance!

20090225075943AAnIxg9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I find out if my boyfriend and his ex are really just friends?	My boyfriend of four months and his ex girlfriend have been best friends since second grade. They didn't get together until their sophmore year of high school and they broke up right after the end of their senior year. Recently she begged him for us to double date. Her and her boyfriend, him and myself. We went and would up spending the whole day together. I was kinda akward. I mean she is alright but she is also sneaky as hell too. Recently he had my car while I was at work. He said he was going back home to clean up. When he picked me up from work he fessed up and said that him and her had went out to eat and shopping in my car. I ws pissed off. We talked about it and I truly believe in his heart that he didn't know what he was doing. (He is 21 and Im 26, Im his first serious relationship) The other night he was on the phone with her. When I came in the room and sat down to watch tv he slipped off to the bathroom and turned on the shower. It seems sneaky to me but then again, I don;t know. I don't really have any proof that they are cheating on me. How can I be sure? I have stated to him that I don't trust her. She is one of those that she doesn't want him but she doesn't want any one else to have him either.

20090225074615AAOL1j6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would someone act like this if they like you?	Okay there is this girl I really like. But I'm not sure if she likes me. I'm 15 and have never had a girlfriend I know its pathetic. She says she loves me but I kinda get the vibe of a tease. Like I say I gotta go she will be like I love you. And she always talks to people and says I'm cool.  She always acts like she likes me but seems like she i teasing, and then sometimes plays hard to get, like ignoring me or seeming like she is not interested. She is very beautiful and pretty sure she knows it, from the way she acts. I always feel like I am just not good enough because I'm just not good looking. I have people who say I'm good looking or average, But I think its cuz I look different then most people, I am 50% lebonese, and my mom was born in the states. I have dark black hair, and brown eyes, I know I have nice eyes. But the rest of me just looks different then the ordinary since I look kinda foreign.

My friends needed to put a deposit down for a holiday and they did, the first day i was ill. They TOLD me, i must give in my deposit and sign for the holiday as i'm the only one over 18. and that i had to do it today.   but i literally just woke up with about 1100 missed calls on my phone. AND they had come to my house and spoke to my dad.   they were quite rude, and said the deposit has to be done today.   I'm going to do it tomorrow, definately. even if im dying. But none of them seemed worried if i was ill aaaaand now theyve gone to the holiday people. SO, untill tomorrow, they may even book the holiday without me... lets hope not. But yeah, they dont have the right to be mad at me right??      :S:S:S:S:s
20090225075218AANXlSe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does it sound like a good idea I buy him a ring, and how do I find out his size without asking?	or ask in away he knows I'm not buying one? I think I've decided to buy my husband a wedding band on ebay. there's a few bidding ones and so far no one has bid on them and the shipping and handling is about $9. I also figure me buying him this shows my love and maybe he'll buy me a wedding band too, which I'd love. I think he has told me before size 11, but I'm not sure. If I look at his fingers is there a way I can tell? Maybe comparing to mine since I know what size I am in woman's? That or maybe bring up how my fingers are more swollen since I'm pregnant, than ask? Or mentioning about re-buying my old high school class ring when I go to Wal-mart since I lost my old one and then ask him his size? Any ideas on that, and what's your opinion of me buying him the ring?

My older sister is getting married in 2 weeks the problem the guy is a little old fashion ( the woman is to obey the man). They live about 2days drive from me and I am only seeing them about 2days before the wedding. My father was a little overbearing so I can understand why my sister is attracted to him but I don't know if this guy is going to treat her right. I think I should just leaveve her alone and let them work this out but she is still my sister. I have about 100lbs and 1.5feet on this guy(who has never been in a fight) so kicking his *** wouldn't be a problem I just don't think thats the right move, what should I do??

20090225075149AASv5W1	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I'm having a hard time getting back on my feet again...?	I had to leave my last job because it was very stressful and because of health problems. I'm better now but have had to move in with my parents and it is hard. I'm very emotional and they are hard to get along with. It seems that every time a good work opportunity comes up we get in an argument and it greatly effects my self esteem so that I feel too depressed to try for anything.       It's been a long time (a year or so) since I've been able to work full time. I wish so badly that I could live on my own first, then make money but I guess that's impossible. I've got to get out of here but I'm having a very hard time getting started anywhere to make money.       I'm only situation-ally depressed when my parents make things hard for me. Other than that I'm pretty happy. What should I do? I've had conversation after conversation with my folks but nothing is helping. I feel as if I'm in an endless dead zone that's going no where because of this verbal abuse and I don't have any temp dwellings to live in because I don't have any close friends since I moved.

20090225074533AAgVtaH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question 4 the girls?	I've known this girl for almost 2 years now, but i would say in the past 6 months though she given me signs such as...   - she calls my cell phone out of the blue   - she really wants to know what I'm doing   - she'll talk to me on the phone for hrs even if shes tired   - she’s asked me a countless number of times to go out with her for dinner/movie   - gave me her face book & msn password   (A lot of this happened during the summer until November-ish, she doesn't really seem to care as much anymore)      Here's where it gets a lil' odd (and I know im an idiot here). I met her online and even though were 3yrs apart (age wise) and we both live in the same city...about 10mins away by drive and she works a few stores down from me. We have never met once..      Since September even though she still seemed to care, things haven't been the same. During Christmas I bought her a present & flowers to show her how much I did care for her but before I gave it she told me she loves him. Let me add by the way, this ex b/f of hers physically hit her, raped her and treats her like crap. Obviously i'd be turned off by a girl who kept mentioning her ex b/f.   Shes been acting really rude with me as of late, one min she says I love my ex b/f, the next it's I don't love him (she blocked him off facebook) cuz i checked on her account.      If ur wondering if I told her I liked her. Yes I have told her I liked her but she’s being really wishy-washy. Shes already blocked me off msn, I have also cut contact with her.      My guy friends summed it up by saying, she will realize one day how much of a great guy who were, how much uve been there for her and how much her b/f was a jerk and will try to contact u again in the future. Do u believe this?

My husband is the victim of paternity fraud. his ex lied to him about being her child's father to obtain child support. how does it turn out (court cases) for both the victim and the mother who committed it? will my husband still have to pay child support for a child who DNA testing proved not to be his. Will the mother who committed fraud be charged with anything or will she get a slap on the wrist for it?      We have a lawyer and our case is pending, the mother and DHR are suing for arrears in child support that he stopped paying when he got the test back. My husband is suing to Set aside Paternity and Cease Child support all together.My husband has signed papers to ternimate parental rights but the mother will not agree, she wants money. Will the judge grant this for him without the mothers approval. I am very anxious to see what will happen. Thanks for any help.   We are in GA by the way.
20090225080024AAsKEvM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS please :) you're all smart. Do you think he is going to?	force himself to get over me? and if so, how long from your past experiences from a good breakup will it take him?      My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a year. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.   should i really just leave this up to him? Let him figure this out on his own adn give him space? But how long :(? and do you guys know of anyone that did come back to you? I asked him if there was someone    else just because i know how he feels and just couldnt figure it out   he looked at me and siad that he can't even think about something like that then I asked him how he would feel if I liked someone else later on and he said he wouldnt be able to handle it how much it would hurt   I have not called him or texted him to cry about it or beg back   im not that kind of girl at all & he knows it. I am giving him his space since he doenst even know himself. am i doing the right thing and   should i just wait til he contacts me when he is ready no matter how logn it takes?

Is there a way to explain it's one per couple without having place cards at each seat? Will people just figure it out? Will guests be grossed out by a bag of soil (in a pot) on the table? Thanks!!

20090225075949AAXVvMW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I ever get along with my inlaws? Am I holding  grudges that I shouldn't?	My husband and I have been married 8 yrs. we have four children. He has 2 girls 8 and 12  and I have 2 boys 9and 12, they all live with us. My parents treat all the kids equal whereas his parents only show attention to his girls. Example: at xmas my kids got nothing. His girls recvd 5 or 6 presents each from them. It was sad for them and I couldn't believe how cruel they are. My mother-in-law and I have always butted heads because she is always telling me "what I need to do ". I make it clear that I am an adult and will do what I feel is best with my children. She always tells my daughters they are sexy and gets their eyebrows waxed and nails done (really long ones),and buying them skimpy clothes, lets them wear makeup. She knows I don't allow this but she still does it. My husband agrees with me and has spoken to her but she still does it. Because of these things and many other things it is very difficult for us to get along.  Now it has been 2 months and some of  these things have stopped. She still tries to put her two cents in about everything and be nosy. I still have no desire to be her "friend". I'd rather just stay away. I am not mean to her, I do talk to her, but I don't sit there and chit-chat like friends.My  husband thinks I am holding grudges that I shouldn't. I just wanted to hear what others think. Should I suck it up or stay away. I hate having the stress and negativity in my life and that is why I choose to stay away.

20090225074246AA1S73h	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When is our Anniversary? My boyfriend and I have started seeing each other last August.?	He just got out of a bad relationship with a girl who he was really hooked on. (he finished it) We work together so I suggested lunch one day, he was talking about his ex loads, and from then on we've started seeing each other. (I fancied him since January and couple of times I felt the vibes between us beforehand but have not done anything about it as I knew he was seeing someone else.) It all started as a friendship, I wanted to be there for him and help him through all that. We've spent lots of time together, went out to restaurants, amusement parks, walks, bowling so I tried to keep his mind off things. And it worked! We are still together and growing stronger every day. My problem is that because of the circumstances I really can't figure out when is our anniversay is going to be? I mean it was the 1st Aug 2008 when we first went out for lunch but he was totally devostated about his ex girlfriend so clearly I can't count it from that day! The first time he told me he loved me was on the 10th January this year. Any suggestions? I mean it would be nice to celebrate our first year but when is it???

Ok so all my friends got a boyfriend be for me, so therefor I herd about there wild make out stories. And it I always hear, "oh he got aroused soooo easily" and after hearing all this. I just assumed that it didn't take much while making out to turn a guy on. Ok so a got a boyfriend, and we have been going out a while so naturally we have been kissing alot. Ok he has NEVER EVER gotten "excited" or anything. And he is always saying how attractive I am, so I know he doesn't think i'm not attractive. And he always says he loves kissing me and he always tries to kiss me. But is there something wrong with me or him? Cause he has never shown any sign of being aroused besides breathing a little heavy. But all my friends boyfriend get excited really easily when they are making out. I know this may be a absolutly stupid question, but i'm still young and just curious so please don't call me stupid or anything. Thanks for the help =)

20090225075436AAhokEb	Family & Relationships;Friends	Can he be more than a Best Friend?	I have been friends with "Andrew" for over 17 years. We live a few houses down from each other. There have been a few times that we have lost contact, but for the most part we have always been in contact.  Over the past year or so we have been spending a lot more time together. And in this time I have come to like him as more than a friend. And his actions speak that same, but when brought to him, he says "were just friends." but has told me before that he had feelings as well.    I have a two year old little boy. He says that that bothers him only because my son is not his.  I can understand this to a point but not completely. I have told him before that I am not looking for someone to raise my son. ( his daddy is not a part of his life) but at the same time I want someone who would be there for him if ever needed.    There was a time when things got a little "hot and heavy" and we almost had sex. But we didn't, and he later said the "were just friends" and said that sex would complicate things, which I agreed.  He said that he wanted to be in love, or at least be with someone before he did that. Well this weekend... We did "that". And now I am even more confused about us than ever.     On top of everything he is my best friend. And our friendship means the world to me. But to know that I care for him as more than a friend and have for sometime, leaves me confused on what to do.  And if i should approach it and how!?!?  Any advice would be great!!!
