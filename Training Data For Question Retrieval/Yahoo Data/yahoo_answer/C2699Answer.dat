UPFl0lksaa	Most jobs involving animal welfare will not hire you unless you are at least 18. However, you are probably old enough to volunteer. Get with your local animal shelter about volunteering. If you are a good volunteer and you stick with it then perhaps they will consider hiring you in the future. It is a great learning experience and will show you that working with animals is not always glamourous. Many things you must do to care for an animal does not involve interacting with the animal but it's environment.|`|6eIVEbHraa	well, i was a few years older when i started looking for animal jobs, but there are a few ways you can go.  You can try working at a pet store, cleaning cages and such.  Volunteer at a local clinic or shelter, get any sort of experience you can.  The more experience you can say that you have with animals, the more desirable you become for future employment.  Try looking in the classifieds of your paper, or craigslist, or any other sort of listings, its like finding any other job.|`|dYURXg3Maa	See if you can help out at your local SPCA. You can do lots of things, even just hold animals and soothe them.|`|gdCJgSv9aa	Try like a Kennel or a simple pet store with pet needs :]|`|26a5ec5f5668b197ac43fc5c516d3cbeaa	Call the local Animal Humane Society or PetSmart and see if they will hire you, or let you volunteer so you can get some experience.  Best wishes.

dB2vKArEaa	I am so sorry for you and your kitty.<br>  <br>  My cat died 5 years ago.  At first, I was overwhelmed with as much grief as if my best friend had died.  It has lessened over time, but I still miss him everyday (he was almost 18 years old!).  The thing is, don't be embarrassed by your grief, and don't listen when people say "It was JUST a cat."  She was obviously very important to you, and it's okay to be sad.  There's nothing to be ashamed of, and you should grieve for as long as you need to.<br>  <br>  Best wishes, sweetie!  :)|`|8013c50f82eeef46c6f78b4773f2eebeaa	I am so sorry for your loss.

Sometimes the cat will have a story why it is being adopted out, and  should you indeed adopt one and bring it home, you will get such a good feeling knowing you have helped this new cat and the cat will  in turn help you.  (You are not trying to replace the cat who died, you are trying to fill a void the cat left.)|`|7dd93714bdfe82e8d1fbff85058952b0aa	SORRY TO HEAR THE NEWS.

I am so sorry -- a pet dying of old age is bad enough -- a petr dying unexpectedly is worse.<br>  <br>  Did you bury your little cat or have her ashes in an urn?? Did you report that dog to the local animal control? The next being it attacks could be another cat, dog or child.<br>  <br>  It takes a long time to get over the death of a pet, especially one as tragic as this.<br>  <br>  See if your local ANimal Shelter has any greiving groups-- they are a safe, special place where people can freely cry and talk about their pets and grieve.<br>  <br>  You could also look for Yahoo Gruops that might be helpful.<br>  <br>  If you should ever get another cat, it would be best to keep it indoors.

IuYekkPVaa	Cats communicate with each other mainly through scent and body language.  <br>  <br>  Staring is seen as a challenge or threat.  Two cats getting ready to fight will stare at each other, in the hope that the other one will back down.  The reason that your kitten keeps looking away is to show you that he means no threat to you.  If you want your cat to feel safe and trust you, blink your eyes slowly twice and look away from him.  <br>  <br>  The web article below explains more about cat body language and has lots of interesting information that you might enjoy reading.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/cat_talk2.htm</a>|`|2fRQYgnnaa	Cats normally do not sustain direct eye contact for long.

Por ejemplo: hay perros que al ser golpeados y torturados pudiendo ser los animales más dóciles de este mundo, se vuelven agresivos y es difícil ayudar a estos pobres a que recuperen la confianza en los seres humanos, aunque existe el otro extremo en el que el perro es taaan consentido que se vuelve caprichoso y pueden ser tan (o a veces más) agresivos que uno maltratado. En el caso de los caballos, sucede casi lo mismo. Los gatos son animales independientes y por lo general son muy dóciles siempre y cuando se le haya  dado una buena sociabilización desde que tienen 1 mes de vida (su margen de socialización es más reducido que en el perro). <br>  Las aves...bueno, las aves de corral (pavos, gallinas, patos), pueden ser muy dóciles la gran mayoría de las veces pero también tienen su grado de tolerancia así que sólo hay que tener precaución para evitar llevarse un picotazo inesperado. Con las aves de ornato (en especial psitácidos) hay que recordar que tienen picos y garras bastante fuertes por lo que hay que saber manejarlos, pero casi siempre son muy dóciles (aunque existen excepciones, como el caso de una guacamaya roja macho que atacó al esposo de su due?a porque lo consideró un "rival de amores" -porque la due?a lo consentía mucho y nunca se separaba de ella).<br>  Bovinos: Las razas europeas son bastante más tranquilas que los cebús por ejemplo y eso se debe a muchas cosas, entre ellas, su origen (no es lo mismo enfrentarse a un tigre que a un lobo ó sufrir las sequías). Sin embargo, no hay que confierse tanto (sucedió hace muuuuuchos a?os. Nos cuentan que en la facultad había un toro de raza europea Holstein -la típica raza de los empaques de leche- que era el consentido de la facultad mientras fue peque?o, pero cuando creció y peso cerca de 1 tonelada, en época de apareamiento era incontrolable porque convivió toda su vida con humanos y por lo tanto, los consideraba sus rivales con las hembras. Debido a eso, ya no se pudo tener más en la facultad) .<br>  Cabras: Son animales super agradables. Tienen un carácter muy afable, pero aguas con los machos, en época de apareamiento.<br>  Borregos: Son animales un poco nerviosos de por sí y pueden llegar a ser agresivos por miedo cuando no se interpreta bien su lenguaje corporal. En época de celo tambien pueden ser agresivos.<br>  Cerdos: Las hembras y los peques son muy tranquilos (con excepción de los chillidos que pueden llegar a desesperar a veces), pero cuando se trata de los sementales es otro rollo porque hay algunos bastante quisquillosos que no les agrada que se curcen en su camino cuando van a ver a sus hembras, así que es mejor dejarlos tranquilos (son bastante fuertes, rápidos y pueden morder).<br>  Conejos: Son muy manejables casi siempre. Hay que tener cuidado nada más cuando se ponen nerviosos porque tienen patas muy fuertes y pueden ara?ar y lesionar bastante, por lo que se deben manejar adecuadamente. <br>  <br>  Creo que no me faltó ninguno. Como ves, todas las especies pueden ser dóciles, siempre y cuando sepas leer su lenguaje corporal y tratarlos bien.<br>  A mi consideración, por otro lado, tal vez diría que por docilidad, los ordenaría así:<br>  <br>  1.Conejos<br>  2.Aves<br>  3.Perros<br>  4.Caballos<br>  5.Gatos<br>  6.Cabras<br>  7.Borregos<br>  8.Cerdos<br>  9.Bovinos<br>   Pero, repito, es tan sólo un punto de vista personal ya que cada quien habla según como le va en la feria y tal vez alguien consideraría a los cerdos como los más dóciles y en último lugar pondría a los perros. Es por eso que realmente trate de plantear algunos pros y contras de cada especie, porque recordemos que son animales y al igual que nosotros, pueden tener días en que no quieren ser molestados y pasar de ser un pan de Dios a un torbellino sin control.<br>  <br>  Espero haber ayudado a aclarar tu duda.<br>  <br>  Hasta pronto!!!!!   ;)|`|wEaLDhdpaa	para mi.... creo k es el perro<br>  <br>  mis perros son muy dociles, todo depende de como lo trates|`|3d42e2c45504ca1fcc0f8acbfc89f2e8aa	El cuyo, cobayo o conejillo de indias.<br>  <br>  Se deja acariciar y es casi inofensivo.|`|9506593213dbd96ca86659dd7802a9ecaa	para mi  las iguanas, ya que tengo una bb y es bien  docil y se llama ignacio|`|9c6f84af2563e97f45b3a529c070b841aa	Yo creo que el perro, por eso le llaman el mejor amigo del hombre!<br>  Aunque también los hay muy fieros!|`|Ao639ZC4aa	mi marido|`|JCFqz29yaa	Para mi siempre el perro|`|ar5xsrf8aa	El hombre, jajaajajjajja, mas docil y domestico no puede ser.......lo mas<br>  Saludos|`|nDG3EEckaa	el perro pero también depende de la raza y el trato que le des si los tratas bien y con respeto casi toda mascota es muy dosil a no ser que tenga un instinto muy salvaje pero si son de cría no sacados de su habitad si son casi todos muy dosiles|`|6wab30hWaa	Para mi el animal mas domestico es el perro,tiene mucho aguante con la gente,y defienden a su amo.|`|DPq5a09Haa	el pez|`|FfEJJ78Oaa	el perro|`|GHmFpmfgaa	pienso que el perro, siempre he tenido perros y ahora que me compre un conejo el comportamiento de este animal es muy parecido al del gato, hace lo que quiere y cuando quiere mimos es cuando te busca, sin embargo el perro tiene un caracter completamente contrario|`|Kn1Oy7craa	1oEl perro<br>  2oEl gato<br>  3oEl huron<br>  (Lo leí)saludos|`|UhZ1mEydaa	el perro.<br>  son lo más dócil y además fieles.|`|d65459aed820a2724f39f0ae139e6056aa	el perro<br>  .|`|tEDe5gjRaa	Depende de para qué lo quieras. ?para un ni?o?

Y8Vy9cHsaa	Some airlines will let you. Call the airline. To bring a pet in cabin is usually around $100, and the crate or carrier has to fit under the seat in front of you. You may need a health certificate for the kitten depending on what state you're flying to.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Depends on the airline..many will let you have the cat in a carrier in the cabin to be kept under the seat...others only allow pets in the cargo hold.  Also, most will require paperwork or a "health certificate" from a vet stating the cat has had all it's shots and is healthly.  To get the certificate you will need to take the cat to the vet for a check up and shots..and it must be done within a certain time limit before the flight.  Call the airlines and ask all these questions.|`|3906f43b843cc7c4980882fdeb0526a7aa	I recently flew with a kitten and it cost $75.00.  She was in a carrier and I was allowed to take her on board with me.  (If I were you I would line the carrier with newspaper & take napkins and a baggie in case the cat poops during the flight you won't stink up the whole cabin and other passengers.)  You MUST inform the airline ahead of time, they all have different rules.  I was on Song.  I was going to visit a long distance freind whose cat had just died and mine had just had kittens.  He decided to take one of my cats little ones for sentimental reasons, so he paid for her. If it had been up to me I wouldn't have been able to afford it.|`|AA10078517	Yes. Southwest is the only airline that I know of that does not allow pets.  Most other planes (American and American Eagle for certain) allows pets.

For example: how much attention has she been givin lately, have u gone away for a few days just recently (like a vacation) which can sometimes cause your pet to act strangely, or do u live in an area or have a place to take her where she can have space to run freely and if not do u walk her daily, what are u feeding her: is her food affecting her diet and digestive system the wrong way if so change her brand of dogfood and absolutely dont give her people food!! if any of these sound familiar to u then its prolly just a behavior problem and with a couple of changes will over time be ok but if not and the dog appears to become weak stops, eating, doesn't want to have anything to do with u then u should see the vet because there is something wrong that needs medical attention!!

Chiedere ad un cane di non abbaiare, è come chiederti di non parlare... e visto la domanda forse qualcuno potrebbe anche chiedertelo!!!!<br>  Recentemente poi, la corte di cassazione ha sentenziato che l'abbaiare dei cani non può causare nessun danno ad un vicino, ma deve essere quanto meno denunciato da una pluralità di persone.. quindi la denuncia da parte di un vs vicino sull'abbaiare del cane, non può causarvi nessun danno..|`|pvQPBHcFaa	ciao consiglio prenditi un cane di peluche così sei sicura che non abbai.  ciauuuuuuuuu e bauuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu|`|0dnP9BKraa	Purtroppo l'esperienza mi insegna che più sono piccoli più fanno casino, i miei terranova ad esempio se abbaiano tre o quattro volte alla settimana è anche troppo !!!!|`|0HLasCxZaa	ma dipende mica tutti i chihuahua abbaiano sempre|`|80BPyMHzaa	addestralo!ciao!<br>  baci!|`|UcT0NSzuaa	mi disp ma nn esistono proprio e poi nn te li consiglio...sono un po cattivi...forse 1 po trpp|`|GygHIjrKaa	addestralo e nn abbaierà mai...!!!!! ciao n_n|`|LCN5rToxaa	Ciao Susy!!!!

Antes que nada asegurate de tener el control sobre tu perro, has que siente y que permanesca ahi hasta que tu le ordenes lo contrario, claro no exajeres y lo quieras tener ahi por horas , bueno con un minuto es suficiente, luego con una galleta o algo de premio incitalo a que salte a tomarla de tu mano, pero solo cuando tu se lo indiques solo cuando lo haga y si lo hace correctamente entonces premialo con lo que tu uses para premiar a tu perro (pequenos pedazos de manzana funcionan muy bien les encantan al menos a mi perro o zanahoria, pedazos pequenos del tamano de una uva es suficiente), repite hasta que lo logres no intentes hacerlo entender con una sola ves intenta esto unos 4 o 5 minutos luego dejalo descansar y asi incrementa el tiempo de practica hasta que estes conforme recuerda paciencia y practica en 2 o 3 dias tendras a tu mascota saltando solo cuando tu lo ordenas.... suerte.

NZpwMStLaa	Ah, é assim mesmo!!! Tenho um gatinho de 6 meses e peguei ele com 1 mês. No come?o, nós, aqui em casa, tínhamos vergonha porque ele soltava tantos "puns" horríveis, de doer... Mas, com o tempo, a nossa veterinária indicou que eu desse a ele a ra??o que ele mais se habituasse (Equilibrium - filhotes) e mantê-la com disciplina. N?o damos comida de gente para ele e ele saou deste probleminha... Quanto ao hálito também melhorou porque a ra??o também promete bom hálito nos gatinhos...

aP4bkYOCaa	18-year-old Calico likes to lick walls. She'll spend all day.. just licking walls.<br>  <br>  7-month-old kitten likes to wedge herself between the bed and the wall and run back and forth, a feat we like to call "monorail cat." She also has a serious thing for vegetables and begs desperately for lettuce whenever I'm making salads.|`|5FVyVS9vaa	Sleeps on her back with her feet sticking straight up in the air, even in my lap.|`|Yzjlxctbaa	My cat plays tag with me, lol. I don't know how this little game of ours started, but when she's in a rambunctious mood she'll run up to me and bat my leg, and then wait for me to go after her before she runs, and when I finally get close enough to just barely, quickly touch her with my fingertips, I jog away and she actually chases after me, grabbing/nipping at my ankles, nearly tripping me as I try to get away, lol. And no matter where she is in the house, if she hears the refrigerator open, or anyone rustling around in the kitchen, she comes FLYING into the room like her tail's on fire, lol. Not to mention she sits in front of, and stares intensely, unwaveringly at anyone who dares to eat in front of her, either until they're done or share some. NOTHING distracts her. If they share, they get a moment's reprieve while she gobbles the food down, and then she's back to staring at them intensely. And every morning, she has this routine where she eats her food, drinks a little water, then goes to use the litter box. After she's done using the litter box, she jumps out and runs around the house like a madwoman, like, "Relief! Woo hoo!" She also likes to lick things herself...like my shoes. Or the wall of her little playhouse. Yummy.<br>  <br>  Haha, and those are just a few of the things she does, too. :-P|`|AA10789534	After my cat poops he runs really, really fast from the litter box to my bedroom, then on to the kitchen.

You would never guess it was coming from her.|`|i3IpA2g5aa	This might not be that strange to other people that have had cats all there life but its a little strange to me, these are my first cats. <br>  <br>  My older cat likes to sing at night and I swear to God she can say "hello". I know cats are nocturnal. <br>  <br>  When my younger can was a baby she thought my husband's nipples were her mom's nipples and tried to nurse... a couple times. <br>  <br>  They both think my fleece blanket is their mother and paw at it and roll their eyes back into their head like they are in a trace. I looked that one up on the internet.|`|MOqn7C6paa	So many.....just one.......<br>  the weirdest thing my cat does is that his back feet will go off the ground if you tap him on the back.<br>  Does anyone else have a cat that does this?<br>  He will also sit like a budda (legs out in front while his head leans over to them),|`|1Zc4NZJsaa	My cats stare at people with their tongues out.

OaaJ7o9Haa	Ease up on the caps. Guppy ratios should be 1 male, 2+ females. Meaning 10 females. If you can't fit that, I suggest at least 7 so the females aren't all paired off for bullying.<br>  20 gal is pushing it for 10+ guppies and 6 zebras, but it is do-able.

Agora, constipa??o nesses bichos é perigoso sim, mas geralmente o tratamento é fácil e rápido, qdo ficam constipados, ficam com a barriga dura, ela pode até ficar um pouco volumosa...os hamsters, como n?o têm organismo especializado pra digerir alimentos fibrosos ou com muita água, geralmente costumam soltar o intestino qdo vc dá em excesso alimentos desse tipo, vale a pena vc oferecer frutas e verduras, mam?o, ameixa, folhas, e suspender momentaneamente a ra??o seca. Caso nao melhore, já li tb q uma ou 2 gotinhas de óleo de canola, soja ou até o mineral, q é usado pra esse fim, ajuda. O metabolismo deles é rápido, ent?o em pouco tempo vc nota melhora.

kv3d8wbjaa	Put the pads everywhere she has pooped (on the couch, floor, etc)  Don't leave towels on the floor and pick up any bathroom rugs, etc. for now.<br>  <br>  When she goes on the pad (hopefully just one) make a big deal about it.  Clean up the poop, but leave the pad so she can smell it.<br>  <br>  Remove the other pads, and gradually (very slowly, maybe over the course of a week) move the pad she uses towards the door (like 6" each successful time)  Then out the door.|`|pEId6a5uaa	bring her poop and place it on the pad....that will show her that she needs to go there, it may take awhile, she is only a baby...but eventually, she'll figure it out.

The crate method is the most effective.  Keep the crate near the door.  Keep the puppy in the crate at night, and although there will be accidents, he will do everything possible not to mess his own bed.  When you open the crate, have him go outside immediately.  During the day, only let him free in the house under supervision, but for naps and when you are away, put him in the crate, always going straight from the crate to the outdoors.  my pups loved their crate and even after they learned better bladder control, they would go to their crates on their own.  Good Luck.

AoSeHXeQaa	As far as potty training, your trainer is right there in the mirror :o)<br>  You can do it!<br>  <br>  The easiest way to housetrain a dog is to crate train him. This method takes advantage of a dogs natural dislike for messing in his "den" - where he sleeps. This means leaving him in the crate at times when you cannot watch him and correct him immediately (like at night). You need to put the dog outside right after he eats, right before putting him in the crate at night, and right after you take him out in the morning. Do not let him back in until he goes. Stay outside with him until he does something, even if it takes a long time, then praise him and let him back in the house.<br>  <br>  When you are with him, and can watch him, watch for anything that indicates that he is getting ready to poop or pee. Then say "NO", pick the dog up, and put him outside. Stay there with him until he does his business, then praise him and bring him back in. If he succeeds in pooping in the house, pick him AND the poop up, and take them both outside. Dogs tend to go in the same places, where they smell their own or other dogs poop. That way you are showing him that the proper place is OUTSIDE.<br>  <br>  Make sure you use some kind of enzyme product or wash whatever he went on, inside, so the smell will not draw him back to that spot.<br>  <br>  As far as aggression, you just need to correct the unwanted behavior.  With many dogs, a simple touch and "NO" is enough. When is the dog aggressive, and how does it act?|`|24CFl7sjaa	It's quite likely the previous owner has treated the dog like a princess and it now has an over inflated opinion of itself and has established itself as alpha. You need to go back to basics with this new dog and establish the ground rules just like you would a pup. You clearly have made a success of your own Pom and have raised her without her becoming a brat so you are in a good place to start sorting out the new one. Get some professional advice on a one to one basis to get some pointers to start with.<br>  Re the housebreaking, get her crate trained as a priority and work up from there, again think of her as a pup who needs to learn the rules. Also get her vet checked to make sure she doesnt have incontinence problems as soon as you can as this can be sorted out and could save you months of trying to unsuccessfully housebreak her.<br>  Good luck, I hope it works out well for you!|`|rBam2CiMaa	Well icant tell you about a trainer but pomarainiens(sorry if i speld it Wrong its not my specialty)are often agressive dogs they arent exactly the kind of dog that wants to be held oh and the poddy training believe me your stuck there|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You can find either local trainers or even Petsmart will have trainers available for lessons. Petsmart trainers will teach privately or in a group. They have potty training classes, and they do concentrate on socialization with both people and dogs. You will need to make trainers aware that your dog has socialization issues. <br>  <br>  Your dog probably has the little dog "Napoleon complex".|`|KxjUim7yaa	You do the potty training. Someone else might come it to help with social areas, but most of us do that ourselves too.
3zv2bbolaa	No, you can not. Registration is for the purpose of maintaining and documenting lineage in purebred dogs for the purpose of breeding and accurate recording keeping.|`|csDhZDvraa	Yep, you can register with just about any registry except the AKC(Purebred dogs only with the AKC), if you want to compete in things like Agility, fly ball, herding, hunting trials.<br>  <br>  There is no reason besides competing in sports for registering a dog. Their value is not lessened or improved by registering them.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No.  How do you if it is purebred at this age?<br>  W/o knowing the dam & sire names & if they are registered, it is impossible thru any decent registry.  I hope you have looked for the owners.|`|aCqSF87Raa	If you don't know the parent dogs (IE have THEIR papers and proof of bloodlines) then the AKC will not accept the dog for registering. Period.

LSynxvhcaa	There are different opinions on the answer to this question.  The general consensus, however, is that cats tend to age faster than dogs in comparison with humans.  I've listed some sites below that further explain this concept.  The second one says that "since cats reach maturity in approximately 1 year, that could be seen as 16 in human terms.  Then add about 4 years for every year your cat ages."
H06PtiIAaa	it can be done if they are the same size, in a large enough tank, and their is swimming space.<br>  <br>  blue tangs can go with a wide range of angels and tangs if kept in the right size aquarium.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	sure.. in a sufficiently large tank 125+<br>  <br>  tangs are cool with any fish that doesn't somewhat reseble them (certain angelfish, butterflys, rabbit fish etc)|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	tangs are pretty aggressive and they may fight.  but since they are different colors and different shapes, it should lower that chance.  also, if you give them a big enough tank, they'll most likely do fine with each other.  i'm not sure about keeping them in a reef tank though.. in my LFS, they have a purple tang in their big tank of corals- so i'm guessing its okay? i would look online to make sure|`|qeOlkRM0aa	Generally not, unless the tank is very large. Tangs really shouldn't be in a tank smaller than 100 gal.
PEPWFGNGaa	Collect it up and make a big pile in a corner where your neighbours won't have to see it when they look out of their windows etc ( people are funny about things like that for some reason) Leave it alone and it will compost itself then you could spread it back on the field after a year or so, sell or give it to your neighbours and use it on your own garden - it's great for tomatoes - if you throw seeds out they will happily grow on the pile while its composting ( same goes with rhubarb and potatoes)|`|nIskOkn2aa	You can compost it for fertilizer (if the pile isn't huge it does compost nicely!) but you don't want to spread it on anything except roses when it's fresh - it's just too strong and kills most plants.<br>  <br>  I also use it for filling holes and leveling low spots.  <br>  <br>  Using it on pasture when it hasn't been composted is the reason so many people have worm problems in their horses and have to deworm so often.  They're just putting the eggs where the horse HAS to eat them, without doing anything that will kill them.<br>  <br>  Our local sawdust guy will take the used stuff back; he composts it and sells it for mulch.  The local gravel pit will let you dump it for a fee; they compost it and mix it with topsoil for gardeners to buy.|`|AA11570905	Scoop it up and pile it in one place, it will eventually compost into good garden fertilizer.  I give mine away to anyone who wants to come and get it.  After a little while it doesn't even smell anymore.  If the horses are being kept in a small paddock it is best for their health to clean the poop out anyhow.  It is easiest to just make it part of your daily chores, if done daily it is not so much work.  |`|B6zl0AJDaa	Once it's dried out you can use it in your compost.  The BEST use for it though is for folks to land in a pile of it when they fall off their horses, 'cause once it's dry, it's soft.<br>  <br>  A pile of it save my left knee back in 1979 when I got bucked off and stepped on.  IF I had landed anywhere else in the arena, my knee would have been shattered.|`|QpElKY8Kaa	We get two barrow loads a day.  I import it to my house and apply it directly to my raised bed garden.  It doesn't have the ammonia levels of chicken manure so it doesn't burn plants applied straight into the beds.  The only drawback is, as hot as it was last summer, it dried out real fast and I had to water daily.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Its great to use as compost, but takes a while to decompose enough to be used as good soil. You can add organic matter (vegetable and fruit peelings, tea bags, etc) to the droppings as well, these will decompose with the rest of the muck and is safe to use. <br>  If you are willing to pay you can hire somebody to remove the muck on a monthly basis. <br>  <br>  |`|4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	Fertilizer!  Great stuff for roses and flowers.  I use it by putting it in a bucket about 25% full, then filling the rest of the bucket with water - this horse poop tea is great for your garden!<br>  <br>  When planting roses or bushes or other flowers, I like to take some clumps of it, line the inside of the newly dug hole with it, then line with about 2" of sawdust or leaves then put in the new plant.  The horse poop is too high in nitrogen - put directly on a plants' roots, it will "burn' the plant and kill it, but if you let the plant get the nutrients by water seeping thru it works really good.<br>  <br>  Fertilizer is the only good use for horse poop.  I dont' know if it would help in compost, but I bet it would be good used sparingly.<br>  <br>  If you have a lot of it, tell friends and neighbors, they'll take it a few buckets at a time for fertilizer.  it's better than the cow manure you buy in bags in the store as horses don't eat as many weeds as cattle do.<br>  <br>  When we spread it on the fields in fall, we spread it very thin.  It lays on the top of the decaying plants and through the winter is broken down and fertilizes the soil well.<br>  <br>  Got any "organic" gardeners or gardening groups in the area?  Tell 'em about it and I bet they'll come and get it.|`|CsC2xqM9aa	what i do is i have 2 paddocks i put the horses in there for a while until they have filled it with poop (it saves me mucking out the whole paddock) then i move them to the other paddock until the poop has broken down into soil by this time the other paddock would have been filled so i moove the horses to the other now clean paddock with nice grass and well over and over again.|`|f0fAx8vgaa	it can be composted for fertilizer,most people who have horses will clean all the manure out of the stalls and pile it so it can compost then afterwords they use a manure spreader to spread it onto the pasture to help the ground retain moisture better and add nutrients for the grasses.some even bag it and sell it for garden fertilizer.|`|yY6Aj1xpaa	Gardners love it for their vegetable gardens and flowers....however, the manure cannot be fresh as it will "burn" plants....a year's worth of composting helps it immensley.  Also, worm farmers love manure mixed with straw, shavings, or other mediums to raise worms in to sell.  <br>  <br>  Get your manure spreader going on your own pasture and spread that manure ... will definetly help next year's grass growth.  <br>  <br>  Also, break up any manure in your paster with a drag....helps the grass absorb the nutrients.|`|UFhrD7DWaa	we have a manure spreader that spreads it through the pasture for fertilizer. that way you don't have it all piled up in one spot because that is pretty nasty !|`|5kUxkun3aa	yeah compost. but rot it first. <br>  <br>  think years and years ago they used to mix it with horse hair and used it on walls.some sort of plaster...|`|3kT2PN1qaa	Fertilizer bombs LOL|`|5UFZryC3aa	  YES IT MAKES A GREAT SOIL BUILDER!! it will provide humuis for a tight soil,, and stabilize a sandy soil, .you can compost it if you choose it takes a while ,, removing it from the pasters will help keep the grass in better shape for horses wont graze where there's poop,, ,, theres a thing ,called a paddock vac, that will collect it  or you can use a lawn sweeper grass catcher  ,or as far as that goes you can just use the grass catcher on a regular mower!! |`|IMPvzBk1aa	It can be composted.  Ours is taken to a composting facility that opened up down the road.  We tried to do our own heap, but it got away from us rapidly due to the enormous volume our two horses manufactured!!  You need the right stuff to do it.   the other post claiming a pile will compost itself is utter nonsense. We couldn't get the pile turned over since we don't have the equipment to do it, and when the heap gets big, it's too much work to do by hand.  It has to be aerated with aeration pipes and  turned over periodically.  The heap can't be anywhere that neighbors can complain about.  Also, you can't let it pollute the ground water, which if rain gets at it, may happen from the runoff.<br>  We were hoping it could be spread on the field next to us, which is forest preserve owned, but leased to the farmer for crops.  Well, they only do no-till farming around here now (erosion control) so manure is not spread as fertilizer anymore.  We got so lucky when the composting business opened up.  We pay them a fee per cubic yard that we bring...we keep the manure in large garbage containers, and when all 10 are full, we haul them down the road and dump them there.<br>  I called every nursery and farm and waste removal service in the area and got nowhere.  We only have 5 acres, so we had too much manure to spread it just on our own land.  We do harrow the manure out in the fields, but everything that accumulates near the barn or in the run-in shed is composted.  Good luck!

4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	Beneful is NOT a good dog food, it is mostly fillers. Low quality foods like beneful, iams, and other purina products usually have corn, wheat, and by-products. <br>  None of the foods in your options are 'good', there are MUCH better commercial dry foods on the market. Out of the three good life would be the most acceptable.<br>  Sorry to not answer your question, but you are better off buying a different brand of food.<br>  I reccomend checking out this website:<br>  <a href="http://dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://dogfoodanalysis.com/</a><br>  Good luck!|`|vNR70lLpaa	neither of these foods are good.  try wellness or natures variety raw instincts.  you might pay a little extra but you're adding years onto your dog's life in the long run.  plus they'll love the food.  my dogs love them too.|`|sc7H3oknaa	Pro Plan all the way. My great Dane loves it.|`|bUtl3fDkaa	Beneful is horrible. Yes, it has pretty commercials, but that's where all their money goes: advertising, not into their product.<br>  <br>  ProPlan is a little bit better, but far from what I consider "good". (Comparing crap to crap isn't very conclusive.)<br>  <br>  ===<br>  <br>  Read the ingredients before you buy.<br>  <br>  Here is my "short list" of rules when I am looking at dog food ingredients:<br>  1) When I chose a dog food, I chose one high meat content. I want to see preferably at least 2-3 out of the top 5 ingredients be meat or meat meal (first ingredient must be!). Meal is simply the meat with the moisture removed.<br>  2) I want to see higher quality grains, such as barley, brown rice, and oatmeal, instead of seeing wheat and corn. Or an alternative starch/carbohydrate such as potatoes or sweet potatoes.<br>  3) I don't want to see any byproducts.<br>  4) I don't want to see a lot of fillers (brewers rice, beet pulp, etc).<br>  5) I don't want to see preservatives that are believed to be carcinogens (BHA, BHT, ethoxyquin).<br>  6) I don't want to see artificial colorings such as the Red, Blue, and Yellow dyes.<br>  7) I don't want to see added sugars (sugar, corn syrup).<br>  8) I don't want to see mystery meats (meats identified only as "meat" or "poultry".)<br>  <br>  Here is an article about byproducts:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=ingrd" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  And an article on what ingredients to avoid:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?page=badingredients" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodproject.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  There is no food that is the *best*, different individual dog may thrive on different foods.  What you want to find is the HIGH-QUALITY food that *your dog* does best on.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples of GOOD dog foods:<br>  * Artemis Fresh Mix<br>  * Blue Buffalo<br>  * California Natural<br>  * Canidae<br>  * Chicken Soup for the Pet Lover's Soul<br>  * Eagle Pack Holistic Selects<br>  * EVO<br>  * Fromm Four Star<br>  * Innova<br>  * Merrick<br>  * Nature's Variety<br>  * Orijen<br>  * Solid Gold<br>  * Taste of the Wild<br>  * Wellness<br>  * ZiwiPeak<br>  <br>  Or check this website; the 4, 5, or 6 star rated foods are all good foods. <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  Higher quality food may seem more expensive at first, but it evens out. The higher quality the food, the less fillers eaten (and therefore the less poop comes out the other end). Your dog eats more of a low-quality food to try to get the nutrition it needs, and most of the food just passes right on through. Also, higher-quality food will make your animals healthier, so you save money on vet bills in the long run.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  What *NOT* to buy:<br>  <br>  Stay away from grocery stores brands. They are low-quality foods chalk full of fillers, preservatives, dyes, etc.. (Grocery store foods are those like Beneful, Old Roy, Alpo, Pedigree, Purina, etc.)<br>  <br>  Beware "premium" foods. "Premium" does not always mean good nutritionally, and is not a nutritionally high quality food. Most of these foods have the same types of ingredients as grocery store foods, just a bit better quality of those not-so-good ingredients. (Premium foods are those like Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Bil-Jac, Royal Canin, etc..)<br>  <br>  Another thing to be wary of: A lot of vets will recommend what they sell in their office. They get profit from the brands they keep on their shelves, that's why they push it. Truth is, vet schools don't focus a lot on nutrition. It's not saying that a vet is a bad vet because he recommends those foods, a lot of vets just are told "this is good food", so they pass the message along without proper nutrition knowledge. Also, some dog food brands (like Hills) support vet schools, so vets have heard of it from the time they start college, which makes them think it's good as well.<br>  <br>  Hills company, the makers of Science Diet, are heavily involved in vet schools. "Hill's scientists author more than 50 research papers and textbook chapters each year and teach at leading schools of veterinary medicine" (Source of quoted section: <a href="http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/ourCompany/ourCompany.hjsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.hillsvet.com/hillsvet/ourComp...</a> )<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  "Big box" petstores like Petco and Petsmart rarely have quality foods.

As a former PETsMART employee, I understand your frustration of trying to feed your dogs wholesome food while not breaking your budget.  It CAN be done, but it depends upon which direction you'd like to go - a BARF-type diet or a high-quality processed dry food.<br>  <br>  Here is my blanket answer concerning dogs and nutrition:<br>  <br>  Dogs can technically live on an omnivorous diet, but any dog that lives wild, whether it is a feral dog or the dog's cousin, the wolf, will eat meat, fat and bones every chance it gets.  A wild dog's diet is comprised of muscle and organ meats, bones, fat, and they will possibly ingest some fibrous vegetable matter if they eat any stomach or intestine contents, which they usually avoid.  Aside from munching grass to help them throw up, dogs do NOT eat vegetables, grains or fruits - and most importantly, their digestive system is an extrememly harsh, short one, which breaks down meat, bone and fat beautifully but doesn't break down those fibrous vegetables and grains.<br>   <br>  If you want to give your dog the best diet possible, either feed him raw muscle and organ meats with raw bones, or at least get him a dry food that is meat-based (check out Eagle Pack, Blue Buffalo, Diamond, Innova, or any of the other great natural and organic foods out there) and supplement this dry food diet with raw bones and fresh (or cooked, if you must) meat and eggs.  A healthy dog will have no "doggy" breath, very minimal fecal matter (because his body is using what he's eating), healthy skin, a shiny coat and eyes, and will not come down with diet-related diseases down the road.  Food truly is the best medicine, and is far easier on your wallet than expensive medicines, tonics and surgeries that you'll buy from your vet to fix the problem after it's too far gone.<br>   <br>  Take a peek at this great website for unbiased dog food information:  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/</a><br>   <br>  Best of luck to you and your dog!|`|ecYNiE0maa	Purina Pro Plan is a good food..My Vet said Beneful is not good for your pet|`|2S0BkT7oaa	All the food you named is garbage SORRY! <br>  <br>  Try looking on <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a><br>  <br>  Feed High Quality dog food such as<br>  Merrick and Canidae<br>  <br>  <br>  Stay away from Commercial dog food brands such as<br>  Any product from Purina, Pedigree, Science Diet, and Eukanuba. <br>  <br>  Edit** You can't find a good dog food at a food store, period!

Next thoroughly, and deeply clean where she has left her droppings, or urine.  You need to get something like "oxo-brite" to kill any odor, because where ever she smells her droppings, she will return, to that same spot to make more deposits.  <br>  <br>  Also get a black light to show you where she has made said deposits.  Thus leaving her litter box as the only source of her odor, as far aas her droppings are concerned.|`|jmVbaKY8aa	first you can litter box train her or him put her in a room by herself with the litter box like a bathroom. tell your parents to keep the door shut of there room so she or he cant go in. and with the smell there is some things like<br>  <br>  Put a car air freshener in the bottom of litter-box.<br>  use litter like feline pine(smells like pine)<br>  `Spray the room with air freshener every evening be 4 bed or when you wake up what ever is best for u.<br>  there is litter that turns blue when wet so you know when its wet,<br>  go in there every 30 minutes or hour or when you get home from school(if you go to school idk how old u r) and scoop pee or poop.<br>  clean the litter box almost every day.<br>  you can put lids or tops sorta like a dog cage on top and it blocks the smell.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED|`|PWATxHoraa	My cat does the same thing. the cat picks a person and poops and pees on all of their stuff. well the vet told me that that is the person the cat wants to change the littler box. So if your mom were to clean the littler box everyday, the cat should go in the litter box. My cat happened to pick me. I started to change the litter box more often, and she has stopped. it could also be a female thing. If you also have a male cat, the female cat will sometimes not use the same litter box. weird, i know. So buy a seperate one for the female cat and show her where it is. I put my litter box by the food, cause they know where the food is, so they will learn now where the litter box is.|`|sNC1MaAHaa	The pet store sells litter box attractant.

Those are the three big food culprits.  Use chicken based cat food instead, or beef.  <br>  <br>  Put the box where she can easily reach it but which is AWAY from foot traffic. Cats don't want to feel like they're being chased out of the box when trying to use it.<br>  <br>  Close the closet doors, If she's ok with using the bathroom, put the box in there. But the hard and fast rule is to keep it clean (any time you see the surface disturbed, scoop the used litter out), and don't put the box within 10' of their food or water bowls.

4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	She is probably afraid of something with the clippers or scissors, possibly a bad previous experience. Have her used to standing still while you run your hands all over, having somebody comfort her and keeping her calm. <br>  If she seems confident and relaxed from that you can take the clippers/scissors and run them over her fur, not actually cutting anything but just running them over. After a while maybe turn the clippers on, let her listen, and praise her.<br>  Always remember to praise and reward your puppy, but be firm if she bites. Never let her get away with biting as this habit could spread to other people and even while not clipping.<br>  Best of luck!|`|lhbpBnBAaa	Sounds like your puppy is not well-socialized..she needs to be introduced to as many people as possible, and shown that being petted all over (head, ears, feet, belly, tail, hindquarter, EVERY inch of her body) is a positive experience. Feed her little treats as people are rubbing her. Another key point is do NOT let her get away with biting and growling and being a menace. If she does this one time and you just stop whatever you are doing, she will think EVERYTIME she begins to fuss she will get her way, making a very spoiled dog indeed.|`|a2OtmRWAaa	Keep brushing your puppy and touching his feet. It'll take time, but hopefully he'll get use to it. I'm a groomer and we always dread grooming puppies because they are so squirmy and scared of everything. I usually take the clippers, turn it on and pet the dog with it. Once he gets use to the sound and feel then I try grooming. If he's still really freaked out, then I go at his own pace. It's important that you don't wrestle him down and make him be groomed. You don't want him to become matted either so that's why you must at least brush him. If worse comes to worse, your vet can prescribe a tranquilizer to help calm his nerves. I groom dogs this way and it helps. I only recommend it in severe cases. Also, you may want to start out with just baths at the groomers so that way he can get use to all the sounds that go on in a grooming salon. One more thing, you may even try a mobile groomer. That way he's the only dog and he won't be around all the noise. It would just be him and the groomer. Expect to pay at least 20% more with a mobile groomer.|`|rMzEt909aa	You don't say how old your puppy is, or how old it was when it got its first hair cut?  But, it's possible someone nipped her with the clippers in her first cut, and now she is rightly afraid.  If you usr clippers on her, try just laying them (not plugged in) beside her when she's relaxed, and if she tries to get away, talk soothingly to her, and cuddle her. But, let the clipper lay where it is and do not put it in your hand. After she calms down, pick the clippers up, but just hold them, and pet her, and do not put them near her.  If you do this in stages, she will learn the clippers are not to be feared, and neither are you when they are in your hand. <br>  <br>  If you are cutting her hair yourself, then try maybe cutting her in steps.  Cut for 5 min, put her down and tiny treat and praise her, then after waiting a few min, put her back and clip some more.  She will soon learn cutting is not as stressful this way, and gradually, you should be able to do it all in one setting.  Just remember, as in any situation, dogs sense your nervousness and will react to it.  So, the more at ease you are when clipping her, the more she will calm down.  It takes lots of patience and love, but she will trust you more if you always try to do any method that will bring her the most calm and peace in any situation.<br>  <br>  Our little dog doesn't like having me grind her nails down, so first, I trim all her feet with scissors to get all the hair away from her toes and on the bottom of her feet, then I give her a break to run around for a couple min.  Next, I get her back up on the table, grind the nails on one foot, praise her highly, tiny treat and wait a few min. to do the next foot, etc.  This works best for both of us, and neither of us gets stressed out over it. <br>  Good luck and happy clipping!|`|7OrFHW4laa	what kind of dog is it some never get over the fear but don't give up have  it done by a groomer it is safer  how old is this dog|`|faa48NgOaa	san diego adoptable pets<br>  <a href="http://fuzle.info/" rel="nofollow">http://fuzle.info/</a>

I know "carpet" remover.Well, we are "Cat People" & have 3, ages 1 to 17 & any time they have an accident we use this,on the rug,the furniture AND the bed. It works better than anything in my life of having all kinds of pets has ever worked. It's not cheap, but I swear you won't be sorry you got it. And the Kitty probably peed on the bed because he or she has a bladder infection. They will pee in places they know you'll notice,so you'll help them get better. That also has been prov en by me over the years.Some times experience is th best teacher......I've found. Good Luck & don't be too mad at your Kitty, they're so Much smarter than we give them credit for! LOL |`|xlm20MZ1aa	Gross!!|`|49516892a30256a05c73d42ba16ec24eaa	I know this may sound gross, but my ex mother in law told me that douche would get the cat pee odor out. If it's possible to still find the powdered kind you mix yourself, it's better cuz you can mix it a little stronger. Hope I helped.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	First of all make sure there are no health issues.  I know when cats are ill, they will openly urinate on something that is personally yours as a means of telling you she/he is ill.  Obtain some "Oxo Brite" add this to the water as recommended on the label to wash your bedding, and also use this product to soak the pad. <br>  <br>  If you find that your cat has UTI, get some organic Cranberry juice concentrate, add one drop to the food, and also add a little garlic powder.  Helps with the healing.|`|0ef3O2m6aa	Ha ha, I have to laugh at the one who suggested the douche!  Actually it will work, a douche is just vinegar water solution and the best for getting out animal or other urine odor!  Cheaper to just mix up vineagar & warm water, dump it on the spot.  Blot it up with a good towel, apply weight to really get the moisture out & then dump powdered Borax ( or even salt) over the damp spot.  This will suck up additional moisture. When dry, vaccum.  You may have to do this a couple times.  I had a daycare kid pee on my NEW Temperpedic and this worked great!|`|UhVUgL8taa	Go to walmart or any store really.. You can get this spray that removes pet odors & kills the scent of urine... The stuff I use is called OUT! Stain & Odor remover... Or anything else you see there... I think most of the stuff works pretty good =)|`|53R2rc6Gaa	If your cats are urinating outside the litter box, its  usually either two things... a medical issue or more likely they are mad at you for not cleaning the litter box .. they are very clean creatures and do not like having a mess to go in, so they will then find another place to go.. and the smart ones (all of them!) will usually do it in a place they know they will get  your attention. Mine did it in the laundry basket once when I was a new cat owner... <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Maura|`|P1N8fetVaa	vinger and water helps with cat pee smell, after you soaked it how did you rinse it out? really vinger will be strong but it works. 
TyMThfrBaa	Just show them how responsible you can be! Do extra chores around the house. If you *really* are ready then ask if you can work out a deal with the local pound, or where ever you are getting your dog from and try out a dog for the weekend.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Research what kind of puppy you want. Find a breed that matches your lifestyle: activity level, grooming requirements, temperament, etc.<br>  <br>  Find a breeder or a shelter and do more research on that. Make sure the breeder is a good one and not just someone in it for profit and make sure the shelter does regular veterinary check up on their dogs as well as behavioral tests: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Fair/1901/chart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/Petsburgh/Fair/...</a><br>  <br>  Pool all of your info and present it to mom and dad. They may dig their heels in. Here's why: <br>  <br>  1) Cost: Well bred puppies cost anywhere from $400-$1,500. The cheaper ones from down the street stack up the vet bills. First month of owning a puppy means you're out about $1,000 for supplies and vet care alone. Then they have to deal with monthly fees for food, routine vet care, emergency vet care, grooming, and training.<br>  <br>  2) Time: Puppies are very time consuming. You have to potty train it, crate train, teach it correct manners, clean up after it, play with it, exercise it, feed it, etc. IF you are in school all day, then the puppy is left alone in the crate and isn't happy.<br>  <br>  Check out these sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wonderpuppy.net/1choose.php#wanta" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderpuppy.net/1choose.php#w...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://petcare.suite101.com/article.cfm/housetrainingpuppies" rel="nofollow">http://petcare.suite101.com/article.cfm/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Healthy-Dog-Food" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Choose-Healthy-Do...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petplace.com/dogs/what-it-costs-to-own-a-dog/page1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.petplace.com/dogs/what-it-cos...</a><br>  <br>  Other than that, pick up chores around the house, get a job, take care of neighbors dogs, anything you can think of to earn money and responsibility - don't forget to keep those grades at school up there!|`|dl1OOOT8aa	When I was younger I made a small business picking up my neighbors' dog's  poop. It was ok, I got to play with the dogs and make money. My parents realized that I really would take care of it. Now raising my first puppy is a different story!|`|1bmHTHFdaa	Have you and them take this quiz:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a><br>  <br>  it matches your answers with the best dog breed.

But my mom made me cry really hard once when I asked so then she softened up and now I am<br>  getting one next year she signed the contract! She made the contract! The only deal is that I must be responsible!|`|YUkKW6VRaa	you have to convince them to keep on telling them you are responsible enough to get a puppy. if they keep saying no, then be mature and take what they say..|`|eCVGvOBxaa	First off, don't whine a cry for one, she wil just think your immature and will want o get you one even less. Tell her that you would like one, and that your going to be more responsible. I think its a great thing that you already help with your mum, and why don't you try dog walking or helping out at a local rescue, to show how much your willing to care for a dog.|`|keXdF8wJaa	set up a contractial agreement and make sure it fufills your parents desire and set up a chart so that you can follow all the things your parents want you to do follow this for as long as your parents want to do.
adetUhXiaa	Have you ever seen how your kitty washes himself? Like all over and intensely?!?! God gave him a great licker and flexibility so that he may take care of himself.<br>  <br>   If you must, then i suggest getting a washcloth wet and wiping him down a little instead of the whole tub thing. He will just get stressed and you will just get scratched.<br>  <br>  The dust thing is like you going to a spa. He loves the powdery softness and the minerals that he's putting on his skin. He will take off the excess. Kitties are one of the cleanest animals. <br>  <br>  |`|o6BDapZjaa	Unless there's something in your cat's coat that he CAN'T get out, he doesn't need a bath.  Leave him alone, and let him take care of his own grooming.  Only if you see that he's not doing so should you consider bathing him, and even then, I'd only do it after taking him to the vet; a cat that doesn't keep himself clean usually has other, underlying health problems. |`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	"Bathing techniques what do you do to stop you from ending up in hospital?"<br>  <br>  dont bathe the cat. you were lucky, this time. he will be ready for you, next time.<br>  <br>  cats love the outdoors. they get dirty, they bathe themselves.|`|gU34xa9vaa	You should never bath a cat unless its absolutely necessary as it strips their coats of natural oils.Cats are able to clean themselves very well, as Nature intended.If there is something very dirty on him, sponge it with some warm water and mild soap and then rinse well with clean warm water,then brush or comb him. |`|Y8ssQvCKaa	I don't really think you need to.<br>  <br>  I mean, my cat is an eight year old, indoor/outdoor cat and I've NEVER bathed him. Your cat will clean himself off.<br>  <br>  If you really feel the need, go to a pet store and get pet wipes/dry foam shampoo. You don't have to actually get them soaking wet and use shampoo these days when there's pleanty of dry alternatives.|`|DQkoxa4Xaa	Leave poor pussy alone.<br>  He will clean himself without your help.<br>  He will lick himself all day long to clean himself.<br>  Cat's have no life, licking themselves is their one simple pleasure|`|5ef5912f6a90f654f9ff6a1087d77a18aa	Keep him indoors...no need to worry about bathing then...nor about MAJOR illnesses and vet bills that<br>  will be incurred from being outside.  I learned that the<br>  hard way.  |`|2vVT24V8aa	cats are excellent at maintaining themselves so they really don't need us to bathe them.  The only exception to this is unless they get into something that could be toxic to them when they groom themselves.  <br>  <br>  If you need to clean Bowie, try using unscented babywipes.  It's less stressful and will not strip his fur of essential body oils too.|`|SKmvuHMhaa	Cats don't need bathing at all. That's bad news for your kitty.|`|2AFAvLX0aa	The best way to do it is to demystify the bathtub for them.  Obviously they don't like water, and the whole experience is stressful.  When I got my kittens, they were in a bad way and needed some bathing early on.  Even though they were quite young at the time (6-7 weeks), they made their displeasure pretty apparent.  Bathing them often is not something I want (or need) to do very often, but I want to make the experience as pleasant (or at least not-unpleasant) as possible for everyone involved.  <br>  <br>  I try to feed my kittens at least once a day in the bathtub (they have pretty regular mealtimes).  This helps associate the tub with something they love.  Occasionally, there will be a bit of water in the tub...enough to immerse their paws.  Because I am not physically forcing them in the water, but because they go in of their own volition, and because they associate getting wet with eating (and getting a bit of love and attention afterward), it makes them a lot more tolerant of water when they actually need a proper washing.  It also helps keep their paws (probably their most consistently dirty body-part) a bit cleaner.<br>  <br>  It probably helps that I did this with young kittens...might not work on an older cat.  Who knows?<br>  <br>  NB:  Tolerant of water does not mean that they actually enjoy it, just that they don't get upset and remove skin.|`|WqnOwS5baa	Cats usually don't need baths, but I know what you mean about it rolling around in the dirt. Our cats used to only want to go outside to role in the flower gardens. If your cat gets dirty enough to need a bath you should use one of the following: dish detergent(it is really gentle on their skin and leaves no residue) or baby shampoo. Both are really gentle on a cats sensitive skin. Just remember, not all cats like baths so make sure you see how your cat reacts before you do anything or you may get scratched fom it scrambling.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Depends on the personality of your cat.  Some cats love water, others run like the devil himself was after them.  If your cat has a fear of water, it is best to allow a professional to do the job, otherwise you will stress the cat very badly.  Go to OnlyNaturalPet.com for some cat safe shampoos, and get some hands on information from people at the vets office or a breeder in good standing.<br>  <br>  A once a month bath could not hurt, but if your cat is a water lover, you may have trouble keeping the cat out of the water.

There is no point in asserting rights until you are sure they're really your rights.  There are two parts:  1)  are you legally disabled, and 2)  is your dog legally trained?  If the two of you don't meet the required legal definitions, then you're at the business' mercy.  All you can do then is ask nicely and hope they'll agree.<br>  <br>  Here's an article on determining if you qualify:  <a href="http://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/148" rel="nofollow">http://servicedogcentral.org/content/nod...</a><br>  <br>  And another on determining if your dog qualifies:<br>  <a href="http://servicedogcentral.org/content/node/154" rel="nofollow">http://servicedogcentral.org/content/nod...</a><br>  <br>  I'm assuming you didn't go through a regular program because they not only train their clients on how to handle access issues, they also advocate for them when that isn't enough.  <br>  <br>  That means you'll have to educate yourself.  There's a lot of misinformation out there.  Some of it can be quite appealing because it sounds really good, but can get you in trouble because it isn't true or legal.  There are certification scams that take your money for fake IDs, but these organizations are starting to run into legal problems of their own and businesses are starting to catch on to the fake IDs.  Faking, of course, is criminal in many areas and can result in fines or jail time so getting caught out with one of these mail order certificates is becoming costly for some.<br>  <br>  So google "service dog" and "public access" and read.  Then contact the U.S. Department of Justice (or equivalent in your country) and verify that what you have learned is accurate.<br>  <br>  Some good sites include:<br>  <a href="http://www.iaadp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.iaadp.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.servicedogcentral.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.servicedogcentral.org</a> (also has a forum for asking quesitons)<br>  <a href="http://www.adionline.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.adionline.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.deltasociety.org/ServiceInformationNsdc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.deltasociety.org/ServiceInfor...</a>|`|ydshiNrKaa	If it's a problem with your service dog, then I'd suggest contacting whoever you got the dog from and see if they can help.|`|j2Fkp5X2aa	I am assuming you are talking about access disputes when you try to enter places. It would depend on the place. Certainly if the dog is from a program then they should be helping you to sort it out.<br>  <br>  The best place for advice would be the department of justices ADA Hotline.<br>  <br>  The DOJ also produces educational phamlets on service dogs which you may be able to use to help to educate places which you wish to use.<br>  <br>  The DOJ has issued guidance saying that businesses have the right to ask three questions;<br>  If you are disabled<br>  If the dog is trained to assit you<br>  What tasks the dog performs to assist you<br>  <br>  If you fail to answer these questions to the businesses requirements then they can legally refuse you access. This has been upheld in courts of law. They also have the right to ask you to leave if your dog is behaving inappropriately, etc.<br>  <br>  Service dogs in training do not have public access rights under the ADA. Some states do provide very limited access rights to service dogs in training, but these are usually only given to dogs from programs, and/or for dogs with state certified trainers. Very few offer access rights to owner trainers and these are usually only for certain types of disabilities, ie. blindness, deafness, etc.<br>  <br>  Dogs do not have access rights only the person with disabilities does. The law alllows them access with a service dog to most places, but not all. It would depend entirely on where you are being refused access from.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to take action you will need to prove your dogs training and tasks in a court of law. If you have ownertrained you would need evidence of competition obedience titles, temperament tests, therapy dog tests, etc, as well as proof of tasks and how they help with activities of daily living. Your doctors would be required to testify to say how the dogs tasks are necessary for you to complete activities of daily living, and that you cannot complete them without the dog.<br>  <br>  You also have a responsibility to ensure that the dog is clean and healthy and is not a risk to humans in terms of transmitting diseases and the like. You need to keep the dogs vaccinations up to date, ensure that the dog is on a regular and vet approved flea, worm and heartworm routine, and is bathed on a regular basis, to ensure that it does not smell, and that it is brushed daily. <br>  <br>  Dogs must be trained to toilet only on command, and it is your responsiblity to ensure that this is done away from public places, and that you always clean up after the dog.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you look at Service Dog Central:<br>  <a href="http://servicedogcentral.org/content/" rel="nofollow">http://servicedogcentral.org/content/</a><br>  <br>  Without more detailed information it is very hard to give you any real advice.|`|WIFKeDBgaa	You still don't say what the problem is.<br>  Do you need directions on where to take him? How to enter the building? Bus, taxi, bike, car??? Does he misbehave in public? Do people try to tell you to leave public places?<br>  It kinda sounds like you either, don't have a service dog, don't need a service dog, someone sold you a "bogus" dog without instruction, you're trying to play your personal dog off as a service dog, etc.|`|AA11991096	What type of problem are you having??

WEM4Ldnfaa	El movimiento de la cola, es parte del lenguaje corporal entre los gatos, y si prestas atención no siempre la mueven igual, por ejemplo, cuando la mueven en su totalidad en forma pareja, sin levantarla, te estan expresando que se sienten a gusto, bien, contentos; por otro lado, si mueven mas la punta de la cola con respecto al resto de la cola, te estan diciendo que estan nerviosos, ansiosos, de mal humor, y si mueve la cola elevandola te esta buscando pero si la eleva y luego la inclina, está en celo.<br>  Esos son los ejemplos clásicos, hay mas movimientos. No todos significan lo mismo.|`|08SLvLRzaa	yo creo k es para expresar su estado de animo, mi gato la mueve mucho cuando le doy d comer (5 veces a la semana)|`|7ZOWjK7maa	ni idea|`|CT3lkrreaa	Esa kondukta la adoptan cuando estan molestos, verdaderamente molestos y lo dejan de hacer kuando estan dormidos, son muy elitistas y puede ke tu gato sea malhumorado........|`|hRDHBaV3aa	Creo mas bien que es como una reaccion del cuerpo para demostrar su estado de animo. Cuando estan enojados el movimiento de la cola es como de latigazo, fuertte, casi con la cola recta. Mover la cola es simplemente como cuando nosotross los humanos movemos nuestro pie, si lo has notado?? algunas veces por nerviosismo otras simplemente porque se siente rico, algunas personas mueven su pie para arrullarse antes de dormir.... creo que pasa lo mismo con los gatos.<br>  <br>  Ademas que la cola es parte de su equilibrio. <br>  <br>  :)|`|mbfO8jDwaa	por ke no tienen alas para agitar|`|A19EdtYKaa	bueno, que pregunta interesante.<br>  Yo podría pensar que los gatos siempre mueven la cola cuando:<br>  -Están en grupo, y al estarlo, ellos están teniendo un un vocabulario rico en se?as para comunicar su estado de ánimo e intenciones a otros miembros de la manada, a fin reforzar cohesión del grupo y coordinar sus actividades durante la cacería o durante el juego, si son caseros.<br>  <br>  - Pero cuando el gato se vuelve mas aislado, no usará demasiado este vocabulario, por lo missmo de que no hay con quien expresarse, a menos que se con su due?o y sea muy unido a este.<br>  <br>  Otro motivo, es que puede sentirse molesto o contento.<br>  Puede estar queriendo expresar que se siente amenzadao, y que pronto reaccionará de alguna manera...<br>  <br>  Basicamente es eso.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|91Lfaklaaa	Es por el estado de animo.

Un cobaye avant le premier vol spatial humain de Spoutnik.<br>  La?ka a donc fait le tour de la Terre dans son aéronef, affublé de tout un tas de capteurs qui ont permis aux scientifiques d'étudier le comportement biologique de l'animal. Une fois l'expérimentation terminée, La?ka a connu une fin tragique puisque les chercheurs ont fait exploser l'engin spatial. Ainsi, en apportant sa contribution à l'aventure spatiale, La?ka est devenue une sorte de légende.<br>  Dans les années 80, le groupe espagnol Mecano avait sorti une très belle chanson sur cette histoire (le titre : Laika).

Les versions qui subsistèrent jusqu'aux révélations du docteur Dimitri Malachenkov en 2002 affirmaient qu'elle était morte en consommant de la nourriture empoisonnée — qui avait été préparée pour lui éviter de souffrir de la chaleur lors du retour de Spoutnik 2 dans l'atmosphère — ou d'asphyxie à l'épuisement de ses réserves d'oxygène. Quelques anciens scientifiques russes ont depuis exprimé leurs regrets de l'avoir laissée mourir[1].<br>  <br>  La capsule spatiale se consuma le 14 avril 1958 en rentrant dans l'atmosphère terrestre.<br>  <br>  Malgré la mort de La?ka, l'expérience prouva qu'un être vivant pouvait survivre d'un vol en orbite autour de la Terre et subir les effets de l'apesanteur. La mission Spoutnik 2 prépara le terrain pour le vol spatial de l'Homme en fournissant aux scientifiques les premières données sur les réactions des organismes vivants dans l'espace. <br>  <br>  Voilà l'histoire de la chienne La?ka,  j'espère que ?a répondra à ta question!|`|oasqdF73aa	La?ka <br>  <br>  La première chienne de l'espace<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Le 03 novembre 1957, Sputnik-2 prend la route de l'espace.

My cats do it all the time and i LOVE IT!! haha<br>  its like a little massage.|`|QucEICKraa	Well, usually this means that your cat was taken away from her mother too early. What she is doing is kneeding. Kittens  kneed their mothers to activate the milk gland for the nipple to produce the milk. Both my cats do this too, just think of it as an act of love and she thinks that you are her mother.|`|SZdSFi1raa	My cats do it all the time. I think they are just showing affection.|`|TyXZ0ZEwaa	I wondered the same thing for the longest time and I actually looked it up once (and am too lazy to do again), but the gist of the reasoning was this:<br>  <br>  If you watch nursing kittens, they apply the same pattern of pressure to the mother's teat while nursing to stimulate milk flow. Some kittens/cats do the full maneuver on human owners, not only the kneading but also attempting to "nurse" the owner's clothing, blanket, whatever. It is a sign of attachment, the owner has become the "mother" of the cat or something like that. Most cats do this with their claws and that can get painful.|`|vMomNJ2Kaa	as I just got done asking this question.  My male cat kneads at me when I am in bed and trying to sleep.  After about pushing him away 3 or 4 times he will finally lay by my head and go to sleep.  Sometimes he will just lay there and watch me sleep.  He is very affectionate.  He also purrs very loudly when he is choking me with his paws.  Hee Hee Have fun, Lorie

Maybe your cat is depressed. It really can happen and if this is the case, there are many article/websites online that may help. You could try google'n it. Just type in "depressed cat." I got a lot of results. Another possibility is that your cat may just be very bored. Give her some good toys (find which ones cats like best). Then make sure you play with a lot on a regular basis. Even if she doesn't want to, persist at trying. But remember everything in moderation.|`|ZPpUrHzgaa	Buy it a kitten as a playmate|`|i1ABGqFyaa	give your cat " cat nip" on his or hers favorite toy and it will atract your cat to play with it.|`|rwxLHu5Faa	You could always buy an electric cattle prod.

Z0vILtdhaa	Everyone knows that dogs shed... why get one that will shed lots if youre only going to give it away when it happens? <br>  Try brushing the dog everyday (maybe twice) to remove any excess fur before letting him inside.|`|9wVYD8hvaa	And why would you wanna get rid of your dog?<br>  Because it's that "time of the year"?<br>  BTW, I bet your kids don't care!!!|`|ByYN3Wrcaa	My Golden was shedding lots a few weeks back and I used some Groomers Royal Jelly Shampoo on him and it made the shedding lighter.<br>  <br>  Do you brush him every day?

mpb07ADUaa	Can you afford two dogs? Not just the price alone, but feeding, toys, beds, collars/leashes and vet care? Can you handle training two dogs at the same time? <br>  <br>  Dogs are not toys you pull off a shopping shelf - they are living, breathing creatures that require responsibility, training, affection, attention, discipline and the best possible care. Are you ready for that? If you get two dogs, requirements and needs will be twice as much.<br>  <br>  Be happy that you're getting one dog, there is no need for two unless you are absolutely, one-hundred percent positive that you can afford all the expenses and train both dogs properly.<br>  <br>  I know it's not the answer you want to hear, but it's definitely something you should think about.|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	You don't want two dogs at the same time especially puppies.  They will bond to each other and not to you.  Your mother is a very wise woman.  Two dogs require twice as much training and can get into twice as much trouble.|`|LJ595i7eaa	well i have 2 poddles and at first i got 1 then a year later my mom said we could get another. i would stick to 1 at first though|`|hqXPkYOfaa	Just get one on Saturday, then buy her another one for her birthday/mothers day/Tuesday. Then cry if she tries to take it back. Good luck!|`|oECTru8taa	If you're getting them as puppies, you may want to just get one for right now. Puppies are a lot of work, especially with the housebreaking etc. Give it some time to see how  you deal with one puppy, & then decide if you're ready for another one.
yheNKIOVaa	nah neither one of them shed that bad. they are both great dogs but i would have to say i am leanin towards a yorkie...|`|eDySIDPQaa	Sorry, Yorkies do shed, poodles do not.<br>  <br>  on the other hand if you want a really good dog that does not shed and is very loving and intelligent and makes a great companion and good little guard dog, ...<br>  <br>  well, I think you know I am gonna say get a Min. Schnauzer, they do not shed, but do need grooming at least 1 -2 times a month to keep the coat nice..<br>  <br>  they love their humans, easy to train, very smart.,<br>  <br>  and alot of people with allergies do buy this breed, but all dogs get dander, but the Schnauzer does well in apartments, homes...inside dog for sure.<br>  <br>  they love to play, run, walk, jump, and will demand attention for its humans...loves to sleep with you..<br>  <br>  and they are impressive dogs, noble looking...and a joy to have.<br>  <br>  Fee them Nutro Max dog food, tiny bites, it has every stage of life for the dog.,,,,and is great for them, makes for less stools, great coats and never dry skin, which helps eliminate the dander problem.....<br>  <br>  but this dog food is great for any breed. not just Schnauzers<br>  <br>  go to www.americankennelclub.com and read all about any breed you are thinking about getting, bet you will like the in. Schnauzer best.  good luck on your choice/<br>  <br>  Breeder/show/handler  15 yrs Min. Schnauzers|`|0DLpxD6Taa	Both don't shed.|`|2beac8ed121b530e43b17263ea542505aa	Well what do you want from the dog? Poodles are very smart dogs. I bred all sizes of poodles. But the yorkshire terrier is a comic so what do you want? serious and smart or cute and funny?|`|b0eab9a2662878a336ef4222a69ad026aa	Poodles do NOT shed I know this for a fact... Google says that yorkies don't either. So there you go.. either one.  My experience with either breed has been good... I know ppl with both and they are all adorable. Good luck. <br>  <br>  Jena|`|hEQeTW64aa	If you dont want a dog that sheds go with a hairless breed becase all dogs, regardless of what you may hear, shed. Yes Poodles, Shih Tzu's, lsa Apso's and all of their mixes shed just like every other dog. The difference is you dont see it like you do with a Golden Retriever or Dalmatian. Poodles and other breeds like that have hair more like people hair instead of fur like a dog. So they do shed but you just dont notice it as much. Poodles hair actually breaks off and falls down into their coats, this causes matting, so while these breeds dont cover your furniture with doggy hair they do rack up bills at the groomer. When it comes to the two dogs you have chosen both of them shed about the same amount and like I have said wont be noticeable. You will have to make sure to brush both breeds weekly and I find that the Yorkie would probably be more manageable when it comes to grooming.|`|589535023cfe7c11b6a24a8212962f8daa	most all animals shed, skin, hair, fur, scales, what have you.  if you are allergic, get a special shampoo that will damp down the dandruff.  shedding can be managed w/regular grooming<br>  <br>  rainanijinskaya|`|Cxi1DNiMaa	Poodles shed.  <br>  <br>  The coat is so thick that it will matt and hold itself and the dander down.<br>  <br>  When you wash them, you will see the hair. The degree of shedding is nothing like many associate with other dogs. The degree of shedding is insignificant unless you are bathng them, and for me the amount is inconsequential.  For the past 4 months my poodle has had a 3 inch coat for water work in the field. There are no poodles hairs on the tile floor of my house.<br>  <br>  Yorkies and poodles are both good dogs. If the only issue is shedding, you'll do fine with both dogs.<br>  <br>  If the dog's personality is important, than use a breeder that temperament tests their pups.  <br>  <br>  There are many things to consider when choosing a dog breed. I won't speak about those, because you didn't ask those questions.|`|aZ7ItEp9aa	yorkipoo...|`|pQn6HhIXaa	There is no such thing as a totally non shedding dog....hair/fur is living and grows so it must die and fall out now poodles hair have a longer growth span as do Yorkies but they do shed and if it is due to allergies it is the dander that causes allergies not the hair.  Good Luck|`|rUFmqWtkaa	Terriers are a toss-up: sometimes you get a non-yappy, non-aggressive, sweet one that is easy to train, and sometimes you get a yappy, snappy, possessive and aggressive one. Poodles are always docile, easy to train and generally a more rewarding dog. Also more hypoallergenic.|`|sQ2LXqKfaa	I personally would pick the poodle. Terriers do shed once in their season of sheding.|`|udj68Wn9aa	I love yorky!  because hair is so beutifull .I can cut free style funny  ..beutifull..wonder.....I'm in Japan.In Japan ,Yorkshire is  sixth major dog in my country.usually  Yorky has no big voises.They have so cute  eyes and tales.We can leave with my dogs  in small house. our house are small because Japan is so small counntry ..So,little dog are major in Japan.|`|ykEa5IUoaa	I am a groomer and YES Yorkies do shed, I personaly prefer the poodle whatever variety they are easy to train, good for alergy sufferers however it is a sad misconseption that these dogs do not give off ant dander ALL breeds have some type of dander so choose wisley,,also poodles are soooo much fun to cut my ink we give her a mohawk in place of a top knot!!|`|zR3igBQJaa	None of these breeds shed. <br>  I have a Yorkshire terrier and for me they are easier to maintain<br>  than poodles.
EriFB7pIaa	These are maggots.  Where did they come from?  A fly landed on your food and layed its eggs.  They hatch into these larva- maggots.  They are pretty disgusting, one of my biggest grossest fears actually.  I will not go near trash barrells because of a bad experience with this haha.<br>  <br>  You need to get rid of this asap, as they will just turn into flys, and reproduce over and over creating more maggots.  I'd be very scared to open the drawer myself, so I know where you are coming from. <br>  <br>  If it were me, I'd recruit a friend with a tough stomach, or my dad.  Have a trash bag ready.  Put gloves on, and on the count of three just pull the drawer open and immediately dump the entire drawer into the bag.  Then I would take it OUTSIDE and dump it into the garbage.  Rinse it with the hose, and then lysol it/bleach it/ clean it with something strong.  Let it dry in the sun, and you should be okay.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|wr7YY4kJaa	Maggots, they are fly larvae. Take the drawer outside and shake them out, if you have to take the whole thing out and vacuum them up throw out the bag or dump out the canister. You need to do it before they turn to flies.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	they're probably maggots aka fly larvae. I doubt there are wax worms in your drawer.

aP4bkYOCaa	Are you talking about the foxes bred in the soviet union with the unique markings? If so, those foxes are not really available as pets. <br>  <br>  You might want to contact the USDA to find out whether or not foxes of any time are allowed as pets in Michigan/Oregon. 
LhXkUCcNaa	If that poor bird has been in that house its whole life it likely has some problems though they may be life-shorteners and not life-enders.  Smoke and other toxins are bad for a bird's respiratory system and it could be compromised.  Unfortunately there is often no way to tell with something like this.<br>  <br>  "Filth" breeds disease and it's possible the bird could have contracted some pretty nasty things.  If you're considering adopting this poor guy (and I have to say, I hope you do for the bird's sake) then you should really consider having him thoroughly checked by an avian vet first.  I would have at the very least, an exam and a CBC along with choanal and chloacal cultures for bacteria and fungus together with having him checked for parasites.  Unfortunately this is going to be a whopping vet bill.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you AND to that poor bird.<br>  <br>  Colette<br>  ParrotletsPlus<br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/ParrotletsPlus/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Parro...</a>|`|4n7pKGKJaa	Ally,<br>  <br>  You can report this person to your local SPCA. This could be a once in a lifetime bird. YOU yourself should take him to an Avian Specialist to get his nails, beak maybe wings clipped.|`|T3DMhdJgaa	Well if they original owner is taking him the vet, then there shouldn't be anything to worry about, unless she comes back and says he's sick. But there are ways to tell if it is sick for future reference. <br>  <br>  1. If he is on the bottom of the cage.<br>  2. If he isn't eaten or drinking for a while.<br>  and<br>  3. If his poop his watery.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped,<br>  True Horselover|`|fDiLHeVDaa	If you have a problem with this bird is being cared for then take it to a vet and call your local spca or animal control on her and take action.Runny poop is not a sign of illness considering they poop and pee at the same time from the same track so to speak.How ever signs of liver damage are yellowish type poo but that could also be a sign of diet.I would not just take her word on what the vet says I would take the bird and take it to your own avian vet to have it checked out. And as far as interior mold it has the same effect on your bird as it does you only worse because thier lungs are much smaller.Take the bird and cage clean cage well out side and rinse well.Then give the bird a bath. A warm shower is prolly massivly needed.If you have other birds in your home you will want to quarentine the new one for at least 30 to 45 days. Give the bird as many fruits and vegies as you can and no canned foods. Also birds can not have Avacado, Onion, Choclolate, caffine, and no CEDER at all in house around cage or anything.source of calcium is ground eggshell scrambled in eggs with no water or milk added.Do not give them any pit or stone from friuts or vegies.Change thier water 2 times a day as if you were going to drink out of it and change thier feed at least 1 time a day and clean the dishes so clean that you would eat or drink out of them yourself.This lowers the chance of bacteria.Your bird has no imune system so care on how you keep the cage dishes and toys clean.place paper on cage play top and in cage as they are naturaly a shredder.Give them plenty of chew toys and things to keep them busy.<br>  Hope all this has helped.<br>  Bratty
lr0q73T6aa	hey go to a vet asap has he had bad food?|`|aP4bkYOCaa	He's constipated. You can offer him some pure canned pumpkin- it's found in the baking isle at your local super market. If he's still constipated tomorrow, call the vet. There could be an even bigger underlying problem.
ff1Tgp3taa	When they are old enough to start eating solid food, about 3-6 weeks add a little garlic powder to their food.  Fleas do not like garlic.|`|fa729d3a3e5b2825b0d964405244fe5eaa	Check all of the kittens and mom, fleas aren't just on one cat.  There may be more on one as they tend to head for lighter colors.  <br>  <br>  I'm afraid on that small of a kitten, the best way to control fleas is with a flea comb.  Just sit and use it to comb through the kitten's fur.  Have a bowl of soapy water available to dip the comb into.  <br>  <br>  You can use soapy water on the kitten but remember that it has to be rinsed very well.  Mom will be cleaning the kitten's fur and any residue could make her sick.  And make sure that the baby doesn't get cold afterward.  They are so tiny that it doesn't take much to chill them.  So dry the baby off as completely as possible and then keep it very warm until it is completely dry.<br>  <br>  But make sure you check every day for fleas and wash all bedding every day in hot water.  <br>  <br>  It will be a lot of work but worth it.  At that age, they are so tiny, it doesn't take many fleas before they start suffering from problems.  Think of if you were covered in blood sucking parasites! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|yLN4NXTbaa	Typically at that age you cannot treat you kitten with any type of flea treatment. What is in the treatment is for a kitten who has an excellent immune system. That's why vets wait until they are 8 to 12 weeks of age. If you have a kitten this young you could try calling the vet and ask them the best way on treating a kitten that is two weeks of age for fleas. |`|BY6OSDSeaa	No, you can't. they are too young<br>  |`|86dfaca280cb2d0df491bc6cbc638812aa	No, that's much too young. If the kitten has fleas, take a wet washcloth and make the fur wet. Fleas don't like the wetness. Not all of them will go running off, but it'll help keep it from being eaten alive (something I have seen, and it is a VERY sad sight).|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Put a safe flea product like Advantage or Frontline on the mom, and the protection will pass to the kittens.  Both of these are safe to use on nursing moms (do NOT get an over the counter product from the grocery store or Wal-mart).  Change the bedding daily, and wash in the hottest water you can to kill the fleas and eggs in the bedding.  |`|AZCtkVmtaa	do not use a flea treatment or shampoo. use just plain soap and water as the chemicals in the flea treatments are toxic to a kitten that young. You may need to bathe your kitten every few days to rid him of all the fleas

AA10098963	I have been hearing that Frontline isn't working anymore.  But you must also rid your house of the fleas.   Fleas spend little time on your pets, they actually live in your carpeting, rugs, and furniture.  I had a terrible time with fleas this year--the first time in all my 53 years.<br>  <br>  My son's outside Rottweiler was brought in my house and he brought his fleas with him. I have had dogs for years and never experienced fleas in my home before. This was incredible...and not in a good way.<br>  <br>  I tried the bombs. No improvement. More bombs..still fleas. So then I went to searching the web.<br>  <br>  I read about Borax (in the laundry aisle of the supermarket). Sprinke it on your carpet and let it stand for as long as possible. I also read about table salt and also sprinkling that on the carpet and letting it stand. So I did both at the same time. I put it down at night, tiptoed around the next morning to get ready for work and let it set that day too. I then came home and vacuumed.<br>  <br>  By now I was too nuts to just wait and see if that worked by itself. So I bought some bug spray called TAT--real cheap stuff, available at the dollar store. It stated it killed fleas. So now that the carpet was nice and clean, I sprayed all the carpeting with TAT. I then took my little dog and stayed out of the house until the spray dried on the carpet (about 2 hours).<br>  <br>  This process worked. I am not sure if it was the Borax, the salt, or the TAT insecticide, but those nasty little creatures are now in flea heaven. By the way, the 3 punch round of Borax, salt, and TAT costs less than just ONE of the bomb treatements (that didn't work anyway).<br>  <br>  You have to remember to vaccum everyday though, even after it seems the last flea has disappeared. The eggs are tough to kill, so they must be vaccumed, and vacuumed, and vaccumed. The Borax/salt/TAT didn't affect my little 4 pound dog, who cleans herself like a cat. But it certainly affected the fleas. Flea free now for 40 days!<br>  |`|1xwyCxdUaa	Frontline does take a little while to work.  I know that I put some on my cat and he had his first flea a week later. <br>  <br>  Luckily, there was only that one flea and I also gave him a flea bath just in case.  So, you might want to try a flea bath. <br>  <br>  There are also sprays and powders you can use for your furniture and carpet.|`|AA10786427	I've found that over the past few years, Frontline's reputation has gone further and further down, due to the fact that fleas are evolving to resist it. Advocate is the best flea treatment I have found. It kills all fleas that jump on the cat/kitten, and prevents the eggs from hatching. <br>  <br>  They may however still be scratching because of the fact that they still have bites on them. <br>  <br>  If you want to also bathe them in a flea bath, there are safe brands about that you can safely use. You can find them in your local supermarket, just make sure they list that they're safe for cats. Pure lavender soap can also work well, however is more likely to give them a reaction. And be prepared for a lot of scratching! <br>  <br>  As you've already spent the money, the best thing to do is attempt to treat the area around you by vacuuming well, and washing anything they use as bedding in hot water. However, in future, try Advocate or Advantage.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4ca1e9ef3fdf5eff8a28678ed072ab9daa	Veterinarians will now tell you that fleas are becoming immune to frontline. It still works better then anything else but just not as good as it used to. I buy the spray bottle of frontline. Its supposed to last a month also, you apply it all over their bodies instead of one spot. I think it works better. It is the cheapest way to go for multiple pets it costs about $35 for a small bottle. I would bath the cats with regular shampoo (fleas will drown) and vacuum,vacuum ,vacuum until the frontline can be reapplied.|`|PxBWZnckaa	i love advantage but i have used frontline in the past with no problems. even if you don't treat your home, you must vacuum everyday and throw away the bag each time. also, make sure you don't bath your cats after you apply it for the first 24 to 48 hrs. or it will wash off. plus like others have said it takes time to work cuz the fleas are still in the carpet so they have to bite first . when i used advantage i vacuumed once a day everywhere in my house, furniture, moved the couch and bed and anything else i could, for a couple days and threw away the bag. i noticed a big difference in a matter of days.  |`|PWATxHoraa	all medicines take a while to kick in. frontline protects your animal, so once a flea bites your cat, the flea dies from poisoning. It works well on my 8 cats. 2 of which are outdoors. It also works on my 3 dogs. So, it just takes some time. but like others have said, you have things on your part to do as well.|`|yj8YgjJUaa	It takes a little while for it to start working, especially if it is the very first application.  Your vet can give them a flea bath which will help get rid of all the surface fleas, then be sure to put an application on as the flea bath will wash it off.  I wouldn't try to buy flea shampoo and do it yourself...the vets know what to use and what is safe for your cat.  I would trust them.  It is not expensive!<br>  <br>  best!<br>  <br>  I use advantage....all the vets I have seen recommend this for cats.  They haven't recommended frontline to me as of yet.  Advantage has worked great for my cats!|`|a8018396476d780598f1ae1e8a525a25aa	I would think if you treated all of them and they have them now, you might have an infestation.... get a flea collar and put it in your vaccum cleaner and vaccumm... check the kitty beds if you have any.... if you notice a big problem you might need to bomb the house... remember you do it once then 2 weeks later you bomb it again... just in case... also contact your vet and ask them about the product tell them you purchased frontline and put it on your cats and now they have fleas.. and see what they say  !  anyway i would call your vet to get any ideas....  from one cat owner to another..  Also talk to your vet about Capstar... it's a great product.... and starts killing fleas in 30 minutes.. |`|WRKSR1Znaa	Just because you may have something on your cats doesent meant they will completly go away. You have to treat your home, and really treat where they mostly lay. fleas are hard to get ird of once you have them.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Start adding a little garlic to their food, slowly increase the amount.  The fleas do not like garlic.  Personally I use garlic powder.|`|7a5Xlv7xaa	I have two cats - one indoor, one outdoor. Immediately after using Frontline, flea activity increased for a few days as the toxin took effect, as Frontline said would happen. I used a flea spray on carpets and upholstery and vacuumed every day for over a week. Cats bedding got laundered and changed every day, too. Both cats also received flea combings and I noticed fewer and fewer fleas each day, until after a month there were no more fleas. The outdoor cat had fleas on him for almost a week longer than the indoor cat and he continued to bring them inside. So, I checked his outside napping spots and sprayed there twice, with outdoor flea spray obtained at the vets. It's been over four months since starting these flea eradication treatments and I haven't had to repeat any, since the second month. I've learned that one remedy alone will not completely rid pets and their environment of fleas, but if one does a thorough job in every area where they are discovered, using the appropriate remedies for specific conditions, one can win the war! Perseverance furthers! 
ZJ2tem3baa	Are you applying the frontline correctly?  make sure you dont give them a bath 48 hours before or after application.  Make sure you only put it between the shoulder blades and part the hair so it goes on the skin and NOT the hair.  If it gets on the hair it wont work.  Make sure your cats are also within the weight limit for the frontline you are using.  It is possible for cats to still get fleas when on frontline b/c once a flea gets on them it takes 12 to 24 hours for the fleas to die.  If you believe you have done all of the above and your cats are still just covered in fleas, call the 1800 number on the box of frontline they will give you your money back.  |`|O3PueQfEaa	talk to your vet about an oral flee control|`|VpmzdCEvaa	Fleas only live part of their life on your pet (or you) basically long enough to feed (get blood) and then they jump off and make baby fleas. You need to use something in your home (carpets, etc) to rid the fleas. The safest thing is Boric Acid (20 Mule Team Borax) just sprinkle it in the carpets, sweep in and leave it. Dont use your Frontline more often than once a month.<br>  |`|vhK7lfkdaa	I would switch to Advantage. I heard that fleas have developed a resistence to Frontline plus and it is getting more difficult to kill them using this. <br>  <br>  Definitely switch to Advantage.

Have her spayed as soon as the kittens are around 5 - 6 weeks old.<br>  <br>  OR the BEST IDEA WOULD BE TO...find a friend who will foster her while she is PG and until she is spayed...

I bought my cats a plastic kennel (they don't live outside but one refuses to use the cat flap so sometimes has to wait outside until we open the door for her).  You can get some which are almost totally enclosed with a flap for her to go in and out of and are really snug and warm (put some old blankets/towels/jumpers in there.  Alternatively, perhaps someone you know could make a small wooden house for her and you can waterproof it with roofing felt.  When you feed her, simply move the food bowl closer and closer to the kennel and she will get the idea.<br>  <br>  Good luck - she is lucky to have you.|`|vhK7lfkdaa	I wouldn't leave her alone to have the kittens because then you'd end up having more cats around your house or have them aborted because that's just not very nice.<br>  <br>  Find out where your local humane society is or no kill shelter and take them there and tell them someone just dumped her off and she is pregnant. They'll be more than happy to take her and they'll make sure that the mama cat and her kittens will be found good homes and they will provide vet care, vaccines, and spay/neuter all the cats, and no one has to be put down.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	You allergy is easily treated by bathing the cat.

The thing with feeding her and keeping her around is that she will always exspect that now, and caring for a mother cat in birth is very difficult because they go off to have their babies in the most impossible places, and it would just be wrong to let a cat have babies that would too become strays. If you are against the abortion then I think you should be ready for responsiblity in the birth and then taking all the kittens to a shelter where they can get good homes, and where the mother can be spayed because if you let her have her babies and leave them as outside cats she will find another male to mate with and it is a never ending process.<br>  <br>  figure out what is best for you and the cat and go from there.<br>  Im pretty sure you'll do the right thing.<br>  <br>  goodluck :)|`|mpb07ADUaa	Have you tired contacting a no-kill animal shelter or a rescue group? The reason I would suggest taking her to a shelter or having a rescue group pick her up is because of your allergies - none of us should expect you to bring this cat to the vet to have her spayed/abort or to allow her to go through with the pregnancy, while having to either keep her while she recuperates from the spay/abort or while she tends to her kittens. After that, what will happen? Will you put the cat back outside after the spay/abort, or after she has the kittens, will you put them outside to or will you find everyone a home? (No way am I trying to degrade you or assume things, I am just making examples) <br>  <br>  Probably the easiest solution would to have her spayed/aborted as soon as possible, and to rehome her immediately. Could your friend take keep the cat while she recovers from her surgery?<br>  <br>  To sum it up:<br>  - Take her to a no-kill shelter or rescue organization where she can get care she needs and be adopted out or...<br>  - Have her spayed/aborted, allow her to recuperate in a designated room of your home or with your friend until she can go to a new home or...<br>  - Allow her to have the kittens, and be burdened with the responsibility to rehome each one of them as well as the mother. <br>  <br>  If you do nothing while the mother has the kittens, the kittens will begin reproducing as soon as they're old enough, as often as possible and you'll just have an even bigger mess on your hands. It's better to interfere. (I am not trying to pressure you, it's just the truth)<br>  <br>  It's really up to you. I am sorry you're in this situation, and I can completely understand that you cannot have a cat in your home due to allergies. A former friend of mine actually stopped coming to my house altogether because of their severe allergies to my cats - that was years ago, when I only had two cats. <br>  <br>  When a pregnant cat showed up at my house, we had her spayed/aborted. And I'll tell you why. First, we already had nine cats, and this cat made number ten almost instantly. We were not and still are not financially fit enough to care for a litter of 1-6 kittens, get them vaccinated, de-wormed and spayed/neutered before finding new homes (I could never send kittens off to new homes without altering them). And surely, this cat, who seems to be the age of 5-7, probably is no more physically fit than we are financially, to give birth to a [possibly another] litter kittens. It was not an easy decision to make though. <br>  <br>  It's a total shame that someone basically dumped their responsibilities onto you. I hope you find a solution, good luck.|`|Zb6t7bSnaa	dont do that... take her to the humane society or a no kill animal shelter.. look it up online and google to see where there is one near you... they will help the cat deliver the babies and keep them and the mother safe... please do not just leave her or take her to have an abortion...

And put in another litter box, someplace the baby cannot go.  They always like a spare, and sometimes it's just a matter of privacy.  Also, if the child is a female, this will have presented a territorial issue, since males will generally not impinge upon a female's territory with impunity.  He may be trying to engage her attention, and sue for permission to enter.<br>  If you haven't introduced them, you should, though they ought not to be left alone.

AGAIN...YOU NEED TO CHANGE VETS.|`|tzZtYcy2aa	A cat pees blood usually due to a urinary tract infection or crystals in the urine.  If it is an infection, the antibiotics should have been effective in curing it.  However, if it was crystals, antibiotics will not help.<br>  <br>  Usually after a cat has been treated for infection, there is a follow-up visit and another test is done to be sure the infection is cured.  Was that done?  <br>  <br>  One of the main causes of UTI and one type of urinary crystals is chronic dehydration.  Chronic dehydration is a problem in many cats that are fed a dry-food diet.  They simply do not get enough moisture in their diet and it has a negative affect on their kidneys.  <br>  <br>  You need to revisit the vet and have another blood test run.  Or take the cat to a different vet and explain the cat's history, and get a test done.  Find out what you are dealing with, first of all.<br>  <br>  If there is no infection, do not put the cat on antibiotics.  Some vets like to use them "just in case" but that is unnecessary and can be stressful for your cat.  Why stress out the cat "just in case?"  Use antibiotics only if there is, in fact, active infection shown on a lab test.<br>  <br>  If it is not infection, it is likely urinary crystals.  This can often be controlled by proper diet.  Proper diet for a cat is meat.  Raw meat diet is best but it is inconvenient if the owner is not home much of the time, and it is not something that should be attempted anyway unless you know exactly what you are doing.<br>  <br>  Next best thing to raw is a quality canned food.  Cats should have wet food only, and it should be grain-free, with meat as the first ingredient listed.  There should be no corn or wheat gluten in any food you give your cat.  Meat and water are essential nutrients a cat cannot thrive without.  They live and breathe, they survive, but they do not THRIVE on dry food or sub-standard canned food.  <br>  <br>  I feed my 6 year old male with urinary crystals nothing but Wellness and Evo canned foods.  He gets no treats and never gets dry kibble.  His vet wants him on nothing but Hill's dry S/D but that is never going to happen...dry cat food is what made my cat get sick in the first place and I care too much for my cat to feed him junk food ever again.<br>  <br>  Go to a vet and get a lab test done.  It is not that expensive to do right by your cat if you act quickly and do not let the problem get worse.  If labs come back showing no infection, treat the urinary tract issue with proper diet.  That is the best medicine.<br>  <br>  For cats with urinary tract issues, fish is not a good idea.  Feed chicken, turkey, lamb, rabbit, etc., and be sure the food label does not list anything called "by-product."
vOYuuLmgaa	Innapropriate urination breaks down in to two catagories - Behavioral and Medical.<br>  <br>  It is always a wise idea to rule out medical issues before treating behavioral. Unfortunatly, there is vet visits and money involved. If you are not seeing any other symptoms - vomiting, diarrhea, frequent urination, straining to urinate, bloody urine, lethargy, coughing, sneezing, increased drinking, change in apetite - then you may be OK to attempt to treat as behavioral first.<br>  <br>  Medical causes of innapropriate urination:<br>  Urinary Tract Infection, Urine crystals/bladder stones, kidney dz, abnormal kidneys/liver, etc. A urine sample can rule out/diagnose the majority of these diseases and illnesses.<br>  <br>  Behavioral:<br>  Cats are sensitive! Her new home could certainly cause enough distress to keep her performance "spotty". It is generally a good idea to keep a new contained to one room for 2 wks - if you did NOT do this, you may want to go back and start over - give her her own room, own box, and let her get accustomed to her space. <br>  Adding a box can certainly be useful.<br>  Many cats prefer fine-grained litter to crystals or rocky-textured litter. Some cats do not like clumping litter, as it sticks to the paws. She may just not like the covered box - try both and see what happens.<br>  <br>  You may want to invest in a feline pheromone spray to ease some of the anxiety while she moves in. Feliway is popular, and effective. it comes in a spray (if you choose to treat the box-area only) or a diffuser, if you are having more problems in say, one room. There are other medications and supplements, such as Vetriscience Composure, or Prozac - something to think about when all else fails.|`|e3u5EEgzaa	you could try a second litter box (an non covered kind). she may prefer one over the other. also, cats are very clean animals. keep litter boxes clean. what type of litter are you using? try getting another litter box and see what happens. good luck!|`|5wkeQLERaa	move the litter box to a different place.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Check for UTI, and thoroughly clean where the cat has urinated around your home.  If you do not thoroughly clean these areas the cat will return to make more deposits.  To highlight the urine areas get a black light.  Use something called "Oxo Brite" to destroy the order.
vOYuuLmgaa	Ugh - UTIs can be so frusterating.<br>  <br>  First of all, I agree with the first post - cranberry does have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help with the bladder inflammation. It will not in any way treat the infection, but it may make her more comfortable if you are able to get it in to her. The more fluids, the better. Find a canned food (the lower the ash content, the better), mix with water, and let her eat that.<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer to pill cats rather than use liquid - I think it is easier. Clavamox does come in pill-form, so you can get the correct dose, all of it, and not have to switch your meds. <br>  It is especially important to get all your doses in, all the time, especially with antibiotics. When you don't you just allow for resistant bacteria, which means longer, stronger treatment. If you can't get the meds in, you need to go back to your vet ASAP and let them help you find a solution.<br>  <br>  Pill Pockets do work miracles - I'm constantly surprised with what a cat will eat in a pill pocket, clavamox tabs included.<br>  <br>  Many cats with UTIs will always have problems with UTIs switching to a proper canned food (discuss with your vet) will help protect against future infections.|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Try and get her to drink as much water as possible.  More medication is probably called for, but more importantly is to know what type of crystals she is probably forming causing the UTI.  Struvite crystals will respond to acidification of the urine, and cranberry pills will work.  But oxalate crystals won't.<br>  <br>  You may want to discuss with your vet special dietary formulations that will aid your cat with UTI problems.|`|jUnFWPpuaa	Cranberry extract pills. They are in the vitamin and supplements isle at the drug store. Usually it is one pill a day for a regular size cat but you could call the vet and ask them about the dosage to be sure. There are also specially formulated cat foods that are supposed to help prevent UTI's. Ask the vet about that as well. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also if you are having trouble getting meds in her, there is also a product out that is called a "Pill Pocket". They come in several flavors like chicken, salmon, and beef. Salmon is the best for cats I think. It is great for getting them to take pills if they are the type that like to eat.|`|ff1Tgp3taa	Yes give your cat garlic powder, which will help speed healing, and also add organic cranberry juice concentrate, to her food as well. The cranberry juice will help strengthen the kidneys, and aid in keeping the proper pH balance. The UTI is caused by crystals that form in the cat's urinary tract and block the cat's ability to urinate.  This is all due to an imbalance in the cats urinary pH balance.

If he's vomiting blood that means he's probably had this infection for a while. Both of these conditions are life-threatening and your cat will likely die if not seen by a vet *immediately*. Bring a stool sample with you if you can when you go to the vet and this will aid in identification of any parasites.|`|5ZPzFoFpaa	Only a vet could probably answer that question.

JgC9a8m2aa	They are carnivores, so they should be eating meat. You can look into a raw or natural diet, but that will take some research and time to do (I like <a href="http://www.naturalferrets.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturalferrets.com</a> for info on that subject). If that's not something you're into, then you want to feed your ferret a ferret and/or a kitten/cat food. You need to find out what the person that gave you the ferret was feeding it. A sudden change in diet could cause some digestive problems. If you want to switch diets, that's fine, but you need to do so gradually by adding a little bit of the new to the old; over the course of 7 to 14 days, add more of the new and less of the old. You want to feed your ferret a kibble that is high in meat-based protein (at least 38%, but higher is better, except for with older ferrets), moderate in fat (at least 18%), and low in fiber (no more than 3%). It's also a good idea to find a diet that is low in carbs (30% range is average, but lower is better - kibbles lower in carbs will advertise as a low carb diet, if it doesn't say somewhere on the bag "low/er carbs," than chances are it's in the 30% range). You also want to stay away from foods that contain corn (can cause digestive problems) and foods that have fruits or veggies listed as the first few ingredients. The main source of protein should be from meat, so look for kibbles that list meat products as the first few ingredients. The better of the easier to find and cheaper kibbles would be Zupreem. A lot of people also recommend Totally Ferret and The Ferret Store ferret foods (found on <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com</a> ). If you have more money, look into Innova EVO (ferret or feline versions). Some of the better, but more expensive, foods would be ZiwiPeak Daily Cat Cuisines, Wysong Ferret Archetypal-1, and Wellness CORE cat food to name a few. Nature's Variety Instincts cat foods are also good and they also offer some freeze-dried diets that are worth looking into. It's also suggested that you feed your ferret a mix of kibbles. Ferrets can be very picky and unwilling to change diets, so if you're feeding them one food and that one food goes off the market, then you're going to have a heck of a time trying to switch them to something different, so feeding a mix of more than one kibble really is best. For now though, find out what the original owner was feeding the ferret and get a bag or two of that to work on switching diets (if you even want to switch).|`|aP4bkYOCaa	Ferrets can eat several diets. One thing to remember is that they are CARNIVORES so they do well on foods with high protein.<br>  <br>  You can feed ferret kibble, a raw diet of uncooked meat, or high-grade cat kibble. Avoid treats with lots of sugar, even if your ferret goes crazy for them, as sugar can cause ferret insulinoma.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	They need high protein/fat in their diet, from a quality meat source (NOT fish/by-product/ash/plant).  For kibble, it should be at least 35% protein and 19% fat.  If the ingredients have corn, plant, grain, fish, by-product in the first four ingredients, look for another food.  Then there's raw.  This diet allows you to control what goes into your ferret's belly (pro), but can be hard to balance (if you don't feed live/frozen prey).  On this diet, you can feed game hen pieces (bone and all), gizzards/livers/hearts, etc (should make up 5% of the diet), chicken frames/necks/feet, turkey necks, wings (turkey and chicken), beef, pork (though I'm iffy on that, for some reason), and for high protein boneless meals--hamburger, and I do feed some ground turkey as well.  Hard boiled eggs (crush the shell and mix in) is also great.  This diet isn't for everyone, and achieves balance over time.  Just a thought, though.<br>  Hopefully you have an ample cage, litterboxes, litter (I use carefresh), bedding (old shirts and the like), and toys.  Did the person you got the ferret from give you his health records?  Those are important, as is establishing the new fert at a vet's as soon as you can.<br>  Hope I helped and good luck.  email me if you have any other questions, I'd be glad to help!|`|KmiU0ogXaa	It is best to find out what the ferret was eating b4 you got it because you should change a ferrets diet gradually,,<br>  <br>  But meat <br>  like kangaroo mince and chicken mince raw<br>  Plain chicken<br>  <br>  Cat food is ok,, BUT MEAT ONES ONLY no fish.<br>  Also a ferret kiddle is avaliable at petstores.<br>  <br>  :]<br>  good luck<br>  they make great pets.|`|74438da54bfa00d5e2f084aa0dab5fecaa	They can eat meat and you can give them ferret feed.<br>  <br>  If you don't have any of that you can give them some cat food.

NFyddSd5aa	One of my cat occasionally "talks" and sometimes hisses in his sleep. I just let him sleep, it means they are in a deep sleep, and you should never wake a cat in deep sleep, as they do not get a lot of it.

Jguzosm2aa	Perhaps a rabbit? They're quite affectionate, and usually quick learners. No crickets involved (; If you've had an iguana, a rabbit is just a little step down, as far as diet goes. A container of mixed spring greens and a few vegetables will keep a single rabbit quite content. Pellet food may be offered in addition to fresh greens. <br>  <br>  Get a nice large cage, and make a few toys to keep him/her entertained. Boxes, baskets, shredded paper, dangling toys, chewable toys...all quite easy to make at home. <br>  <br>  Rabbits usually adapt quickly to being on a harness, so you can even take them out without worry.

French lops are absolutely gorgeous but pretty BIG rabbits with beautiful cuddly personalities. I currently have 2 mini lops (or Holland lops as known in some countries) they are the smallest of the lop breeds and have pretty friendly inquisitive natures.

An unfixed male, can smell a female in heat from miles away and will do anything he has to, to get to her and mate with her! Don't turn your back for a second!|`|gwUMipsUaa	We had a female dog spayed during her first  heat cycle, and she developed just fine.  Not saying that it's bad, but maybe you can find a vet who will do it sooner.  Most vets actually encourage doing it before the first heat cycle.

Wn3LGHTvaa	That is way too small for three turtles. Also, considering that RES are notoriously aggressive, I would not give them access to an expensive turtle.|`|O1VcREmJaa	That is definitely too small. The rule of thumb for aqwuatics turtel is ten gallons per inch. That tank is too small for just one turtle. Also you don't want to house different species together because they will be aggressive towards one another. Even same species tend to be aggressive as they mature because they become more territorial as they get older. Knowing that technically they should all be seperated. However as juviniles the two red eared sliders should be fine. No matter what though you need a larger tank. I have a red eared slider that is a little over an inch and I have him in a 75 gallon. At that size you dnt need a tank that large, but he will grow and once he's full grown technically my 75 gallon will be too small.
ZJV9iap5aa	I agree with Shalakoa^ but I know of an old maltese that was getting doggy arthritis and had surgery, who was introduced to a loud, yappy, hyperactive bijon who annoys it all the time.  They get along now but I see the older dog get really pissed sometimes and walk away sad when the bijon acts like a jerk during the older dog's daily routine stuff like greeting the people, lining up for food bowls, and lining up to go out the door or down stairs.  It snaps at her and steals the bijon's toys and snacks.  They both love me, the janitor who comes twice a week.|`|LeXzhxs9aa	well i dont think it is that cruel. because at least there not taking the older dog to the pound.<br>  And alot of parents buy a puppy wen there older dog is near the end so there kid/s wont start crying and get upset about it dying. |`|AA12273993	My doberman was a "Replacement" for my rottie. I wanted her to learn from my rottweiler in case she died and I did not want a replacement dog after she died because I would feel as if I was getting a dog just because i didn't have one. My dog started life with another dog because she was a "replacement" dog, the other dog ended up living a good 5 years after because he perked up when we got the puppy, unfortunately my rottie didn't.<br>  <br>  And just so you know I mourned she died over a year ago and I am still mourning, My doberman helps me through it. So no I do not think it is cruel, people deal with things differently.<br>  <br>  but thats just my opinion, your entitled to your own.|`|TRganQA4aa	I didn't set out to get a puppy when I had one of my German Shepherds that was 12 and in failing health - I was given one by a friend, and that little puppy (another German Shepherd) I believe gave my old dog a new lease on life. He started acting like a puppy and playing with it and the spark came back in his eyes - I took him to the vet and the vet asked what I did with Lobo - that this couldn't possibly be the same dog that we'd been giving HD meds to. As a result - I think he lived another year (most of it good) that he might not have had we not been blessed with that puppy. <br>  <br>  To me it sounds like they ignore the Labrador - I would agree with you in that case as they came out and said it, but if you get a new pup, not as a replacement - and still lavish your old dog with the same affection and love that he is accustomed to - then it could be beneficial for the old dog as well. <br>  <br>  What I think is extremely callous and immoral is taking an old dog to a pound because they could not care for it anymore, or afford the meds for it ( one old German Shepherd - he was almost 10-  we once adopted - the only medical issue it had was thyroid and that was the reason he was given up - thyroid tabs are cheap!!! - twenty dollars for a little more than a month supply - c'mon!!) or they got a new dog. That is not right and how do you think the dog feels after giving yo uyears of companionship? That burns my buttons!<br>  <br>  I have a 13 yr old Shepherd/Collie mix (she was 3 when my mom brought her home as a stray after befriending her outside the hospital she worked at - she had her taken to a vet and neutered - she was skin and bones - and people thought she had mange because her legs are a funny color brindle - rest of her is solid black - but she is a unique looking dog), She is 13 but she still loves life - can't see too well, but still plays with my 2 coonhounds every once in a while (she never was a big one for playing - she has to be in the mood - but she does believe in showing the other dogs affection) - but I would never get rid of her or put her down unless the vet said that if I kept her alive she would suffer. I could never just dump a dog because it is old or look for a replacement unless I felt it might do the other dog some good. <br>  <br>  I recently lost my beloved Dixie-Girl unexpectedly at the age of 9, about 3 months ago - and I wasn't looking to get a dog, but for some reason I went on Petfinder. I saw Reba's picture ( i had always wanted a Redbone Coonhound so I could name her Reba) and she had a video clip and at first I tried to talk myself out of it as I had just lost Dixie, but I went ahead and applied for her because Dale was looking sort of lost without Dixie and I knew Coonhounds are usually hard to place and it was a kill shelter so I went for it. I'm glad I did because she fit right in and it is like she has always been here (Dale and Shadow love her). I mourned Dixie but having Reba helped me and Dale get over it a little.|`|m0k4DwHcaa	Actually it is a good thing to get a puppy for a senior dog.   The pup gives the senior a new lease on life and a more active life for whatever time it has left.   When the time comes and the senior passes, the puppy will help you through the grieving process.   Of course, this  only applies to those people whose pets are family members, not to those who have a dog or a cat that is just a dog or a cat.<br>  |`|BwL4lv8uaa	i have an older maltese and i recently bought a new puppy but i did it for a different reason. for my maltese being around the puppy brought out the young in him again...he plays now and seems more energetic, hopefully this gives me more time with him! but for people buying new puppies to REPLACE their older dog is cruel. i would never ever advise doing that.|`|AjCxg8mFaa	I don't think its replacing the older dog. I got a new puppy about twelve months before the older dog died and the older dog had great fun with the puppy and taught him lot's of things. They played all the time and our older dog got a new lease of life. Our older dog could never be replaced. They are all individual and have their good points and their bad, as do we all. |`|614f441d409d6912be8c96b43fdac75daa	I would consider buying a new pup when my dog is old because I want her to know the pup and approve of my new companion, but people should never give up on a dog and count on its dying soon like you describe.|`|peQIh3Pgaa	I don't think it's bad. That's like saying that someone with a 5 year old child wanting a baby is bad. It's not. As long as they pay lots of attention to both dogs, it's fine!|`|xVgYZpQkaa	why??? if u try to penetrate into a dog's thought,I'm sure ur going to be happy to have a friend to play with.|`|EHF8yYwCaa	No, I don't think it's cruel.  <br>  <br>  Someone else mentioned that a young dog can sometimes bring new life into an older dog's activity.  Just like with people, staying active and mentally stimulated helps with an older dog's quality & length of life.  Gives the older dog a friend, a playmate.....assuming your older dog is welcoming of a newcomer, this can be a blessing for him!  <br>  <br>  I doubt an older dog looks at a new puppy and thinks "Oh dear, I'm being replaced."  Dogs don't realize their mortality the way people do, they don't understand concepts quite as complex as "I'm being replaced".  Provided the human still takes great care to treat the old dog THE SAME....give him attention and all the "respect" the veteran dog of the house deserves (put his bowl down first, pet him first, give him the prime sleeping spot).....he usually won't have ANY negative association with the new puppy.  <br>  <br>  I agree it's kind of "blunt" to just come out and say "My old dog's gonna die soon so I'm-a-gonna just get me a new puppy to replace him before he croaks".....but, some people are matter-of-fact like that, and it doesn't NECESSARILY mean they don't care for their dogs.  (Then again, selling one pet- the ferrets- in exchange for a new puppy IS irresponsible and probably indicates those people viewed their dogs as THINGS, not animals).  <br>  <br>  But I have family members who are mercilessly BLUNT....they shoot straight, say it like it is, and it comes off as crass & unfeeling to most.  They don't use feel-good euphemisms for unpleasant things...when a pet dies, they're dead....not "passed away, with God, or not-with-us-any-longer".  These people I know have a heart of GOLD and you have to look past the way things are said.  <br>  <br>  Plus, everyone deals with death in a different way.  Not everyone feels the need to "mourn" everything.  The Cajuns in Louisiana have a parade & a party when someone dies, to celebrate their LIFE and their passing to "paradise"!!  That's what I want when I die!  Some folks don't want the empty space and uncanny quiet that's left over when the old dog dies....they want to make sure there will always be the jingle of tags, the clicking of nails and the yapping at the door that accompanies the presence of a dog.  Just because a new dog is present after the old one dies, doesn't mean they don't MOURN the old dog, either....everyone mourns in their own way.  <br>  <br>  Nothing is "cruel" unless an animal suffers....and unless bringing a pup into the home with an old dog is going to make him suffer somehow, it's not cruel, IMO....|`|tB7QK6BTaa	No, I would not think the dog "Can tell it's being replaced"<br>  <br>  No, I do not think it is cruel.<br>  <br>  No, I do not humanize my pets.<br>  <br>  Destroying a dog because a person wants a different dog, now that is ignorant and cruel.  Getting a dog before the oldster passes is a normal enough thing for people who want to have continuity.  It also has the advantage that the older dog helps teach the youngster the house rules.<br>  <br>  Getting a dog right away when your current dog dies can have negative effects do to choosing a puppy with your emotions rather than your reasoning, so from that side of things getting the puppy a couple years earlier makes for a better choice.<br>  <br>  As to periods of morning and obligation to the dead, that seems to be a personal morality belief issue, and therefor has not 'right' or 'wrong' answer it is merely one persons 'belief'.  |`|jd5mOYfbaa	A lot of times a new puppy is a companion, not only for us humans but for the older dog as well.

Puppies get attached to the older dog, then it dies on them.  My parents did that.  It was kinda so the dog would have a younger buddy.  When the old dog died, the puppy was very depressed, so we ended up having to get another dog.  I think its kinda messed up if they give the new puppy more attention then the older dog, but I can kind of see how they would think that having the other dog would make the kids less sad when the old one dies.  I don't think people should be forced to morn.  I got a new kitten as soon as i could when my old cat died, I missed her so much and needed a cat around. I'm still sad about the cat, but the kitten helps cheer me up.  Maybe they are already mourning the loss of the dog even though he isn't even gone yet.<br>  |`|3zv2bbolaa	Many veteran dogs find a new youthful lease on life when a puppy is introduced to the household. They can become more active and playful and many seem to enjoy the new canine company. An owner must be careful that the young, exuberant pup doesn't annoy the older dog and it is important to make certain that the pack order is maintained, giving deference to the veteran dog. |`|kRO55DHyaa	I think that having another animal in the home helps ease the passing of a loved pet.  I don't find it cruel at all.  I don't believe at all that the dogs have any sense of being "replaced".  I do find it despicable when someone actually does replace the old dog by dumping it at a shelter or rescue after getting a new puppy because they felt that two were too many to handle or because they didn't get along.  <br>  <br>  I have four dogs in my home-the newest actually IS a replacement dog (he's going to replace our 8 year old Golden next year in pheasant hunting-she can't handle all the walking anymore because of her hip dysplasia) and we have already been in contact with a breeder for a 2010 breeding of another dog to replace her in waterfowl hunting.  She was very happy to accept the puppy into our home, as were our 7 & 12 year old dogs, and I'm certain that they all will easily accept the new puppy when the time comes.<br>  <br>  I have been there before, and I felt that the pets left living in my home really helped me cope with the grief of losing one...and besides, I'm not the kind of person who could actually deal with having only one dog in my home.

RNqHUNgEaa	they are following the breed standard. Traditionally some dog breeds did work that often caused harm to their ears or tails. Cart pulling dogs could get their tail caught in the cart and get injured, so they were docked. Some breeds, like those bred to hunt boar, could easily get their ears torn by the boar and so they were cropped.<br>  <br>  It's part of the breed history and a standard tries to make a dog as close to the historic breed as possible. |`|Bw18seFqaa	Originally it was to prevent tail and ear injuries in working dogs..  certain breeds performed tasks and they were at risk for those injuries.<br>  <br>  A tail or ear injury can be quite painful...  cropping and docking were less painful if done properly and at an early age.<br>  <br>  Since few dogs are actually used for work anymore.. today its mainly for appearance..  because certain breeds are expected to be cropped and/or docked.|`|wjwsFPMuaa	It's cosmetic and is written into some breed standards. I'm not against it either, i just find it very political to require something so cosmetic so a dog can be in the show ring, yet my Long-Haired GSD isn't registerable with the AKC. He's just as capable as any other GSD to do his job. The ONLY difference is coat. He's not any less purebred. Notice how they have long haird and short haired versions of the same dog in shows. I just don't understand why they can't do the same for other breeds. Smooth coated collie, rough collie, long-haird daschund, short haired daschund, wire haired daschund, long haired chihuahua, short haired chihuahua, miniature schnauzer, standard schnauzer, and giant schnauzer....it's all just too political for me sometimes. And frustrating too. Sorry..i ranted...but yes I do agree with you it makes some breeds look very refined. |`|mGzwEvQbaa	Ever see a Boston Terrier with full ears?<br>  <br>  Best<br>  <br>  thing<br>  <br>  ever<br>  <br>  <br>  Her tail was already done when we got her, so I couldn't spare her that one.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	In some breeds ear cropping was done to protect the ears; dogs in dog fights had their ears cropped as a precaution from having them bitten off; war dogs for a similar purpose. This, mind you, was a while ago.<br>  Tail docking was done for a similar purpose, though now most docking and cropping is done for cosmetic reasons and on show dogs due to the breed standard. Different countries/kennel clubs sometimes have different breed standards pertaining to docking and cropping and some breeds are penalized if they are docked or cropped.<br>  Hope that helps!|`|uTIgyCCHaa	To prevent injury.  Especially in working dogs or breeds that are prone to ear infections or broken tails, docking and cropping when they're young prevents chronic ear infections and tail injury that would result in docking later on (which at that point would be very traumatic for the dog).<br>  <br>  This site's got some great info on the subject of docking.<br>  <a href="http://www.cdb.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdb.org/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Josh O --<br>  Boston Terriers are not docked OR cropped.  Their ears stand naturally and they have short, corkscrew tails.|`|IBgEtWNPaa	I believe that a great majority of dogs are docked and cropped purely for aesthetic reasons, which I am against.  <br>  <br>  However, I do hunt with my dogs (spaniels) and having a docked tail is a great advantage while out on the field.  I have seen so many horrific tail injuries suffered from undocked dogs getting caught and tangled in the brush.  If a person is going to work their dogs it's much easier to have the tail docked when they're only a few days old and can't feel anything than when they're full grown and have to suffer having their tail nearly broken in half.  I do own 2 undocked spaniels and they are excellent hunting dogs in their own right, but the fact that they still have their tails does worry me when they're out in the fields and get into thick cover.<br>  <br>  As for cropping, I only know of one person who crops their dogs ears, because he works his dogs.  He hunts wild boar with his dogs and apparently the boars teeth and tusks can do some serious damage to flopping uncropped ears.  Every one else I've met only cropped their dogs ears because they want to fit some standard image, which seems silly to me if the dog isn't actually fulfilling its true purpose on the field.|`|TWfDAYK4aa	My opinion......cosmetic.  No other.  A Rottweiler without a tail, can look mean and intimidating, unless you are able to see the little stub wagging beyond that huge, commanding head.  Whereas a tailed Rott is a beautiful thing.  You know that dog is happy, you don't have to wait for the butt to wiggle, you see the tail.  <br>  In AKC standard, it state,  tail, docked one to two vertebrae, anything else is a fault, or in some peoples eyes absolutlely horrific.  Whereas, in Germany and other overseas countries they are not allowed to dock.  So all imports have the tail.  <br>  I personally own one of each.  I prefer the tail, but will have major problems should I begin showing in AKC|`|aQ4aoRVqaa	It use to and can still have some purposes depending. Various hunting dogs usually get their tails docked so they don't swish around the brush and make the game aware of their presence. And other times it is a breed standard. I personally am not too fond of it. I love floppy ears and tails, lol. :)|`|9K3JXVi7aa	Docking the ears is generally done on dogs that were historically bread for protection it makes the dogs seem more alert and focused|`|Jguzosm2aa	In breeds used for hunting, herding and fighting these procedures were to minimize injury by reducing the number of places a dog could be grabbed by another animal. Tail docking is sometimes done to prevent tail injury; hunting dogs and dogs which have to work in confined spaces are at a greater risk for tail injury, which is painful and difficult to treat. For strong, energetic dogs, tails are sometimes docked to prevent them from being injured by excessive wagging; while this may seem a bit more unbelievable, I've actually seen dogs draw blood from wagging their tails so enthusiastically. In long haired breeds, such as Yorkshire terriers, tails are docked for hygienic reasons. <br>  <br>  These days, tail docking and ear cropping are mostly for aesthetic reasons, and breed standards. It's simply tradition for some breeds, and many people prefer the appearance of docked/cropped dogs.   |`|t9Fxx75uaa	I think it's a thing for breed standard.  I personally don't like it.  Live and let live I say.  I like all dogs just the way God made em.

If not then keep it INSIDE until it has.|`|0egNQP5zaa	Just make sure that you don't stay out for two long, and give your puppy a good rub down when you get back.|`|8db586f91e5df0bb39b3ffce37310178aa	 Yes defineately,get him used to all weathers.Not too far at first though.I have always found frequent short walks when they are very young are best.Happy Puddle jumping! C x|`|0fuF2sHbaa	Yes if he's had all his shots, of course.<br>  <br>  Usually puppies tell you if they want to be carried. <br>  <br>  If he starts shivering or refuses to walk then pick him up and be sure to keep him away from any puddles because you never know what sort of parasites and chemicals can be lurking in there. <br>  |`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	Dogs are not made of sugar...they won't melt in the rain. ;-)|`|KgQ6DHWiaa	I think it is fine, as long as it doesn't get too cold. I did this myself when my dog was about the same age and some horrible fat women pulled over and proceeded to shout at me, claiming that my stroll down the street will ruin my dogs legs. I hate people who think they are dog gods! |`|lhbpBnBAaa	If you are being active and don't mind cleaning up the mess of wet paws, it's fine. Just be aware that he may not be able to stand the cold for as long, and make sure to dry him off well when you bring him back inside.|`|9qqzRTpDaa	Oh yea...Walk on!! best thing for him, or her...If it is a tiny one with little hair though you must get a sweater, otherwise it is a great thing. all other breeds are hearty, and their coats are sufficient.|`|laSBohonaa	yes because you have to build up its muscle 
3nJcHepoaa	Rabbits are GREAT pet you can cuddle them take them for walks and let the roam around the backyard (as long as its inclosed)<br>  <br>  Considerations of Buying a Rabbit<br>  <br>  Before you purchase a rabbit please ensure that you have thought carefully about the responsibility of pet ownership. Speak to your local veterinarian and other pet owners, and gather as much information as you can to aid you in your decision. Never buy a rabbit on impulse - owning a pet is a commitment, which should be carefully considered. For more information about pet ownership click here.<br>  <br>  Basic Rabbit Needs<br>  <br>  The following information is intended to provide a very basic overview of the essentials of caring for your pet. It does not cover every aspect of the care of your pet and we strongly advise that you seek further specific information and advice in order to ensure the welfare of any animals in your care.<br>  <br>  Companionship<br>  <br>  Rabbits need to be with other rabbits or with humans.<br>  <br>  Housing<br>  <br>  A rabbit must be provided with a good roomy hutch. A recommended design for a hutch is a cage divided into two connecting compartments. One compartment is for daytime with a wire mesh door to admit light and air, and the other is to provide shelter from wind, rain, or cold.<br>  <br>  The roof of the hutch should be hinged to allow ease of access to the compartments for cleaning purposes and the hutch should be raised off the ground and sited to catch the morning sun. A ramp or steps from the ground to the day compartment will allow the animals access to the exercise enclosure.<br>  <br>  The floor of the hutch should be designed to contain a litter of organic matter such as peat moss about 5cm deep covered with a thick layer of bedding straw. It is not advisable to use wood shavings from soft woods such as cedar and pine for bedding as the chemicals that they release can cause respiratory and liver problems in rabbits. The day compartment of the hutch should be fitted with a water bottle, hayrack, gnawing block or bark covered log, and an earthenware feeding bowl.<br>  <br>  The hutch should be situated in a sheltered position and should not face directly into the midday sun or in the prevailing wind. Rabbits are highly susceptible to heat stress, so in hot weather place the hutch in the shade and hang damp towels over the hutch to aid cooling. In very cold weather, place the hutch in a sheltered position and make sure that wind and rain cannot enter the hutch directly. To help keep your rabbit warm in winter add extra bedding to the hutch.<br>  <br>  A suitable hutch size for two rabbits is 180cm in length by 90cm in width by 90cm in height. The hutch should be thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed weekly and replacing the bedding straw must be done on a daily.<br>  <br>  Exercise Enclosure<br>  <br>  A strongly fenced enclosure should be built about the hutch to provide earth-contact exercise for rabbit. The enclosure fence must not only protect your pets from predators, but must prevent their escape by burrowing, or jumping. Inside the enclosure there should be some hollow logs and pipes, shrubbery, or rocky caves, to provide the animals with cover and protection. At night, or in bad weather, your rabbit must be locked up in the hutch.<br>  <br>  Handling<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that rabbits are prey animals and, as a consequence, many do not like being held as they find this threatening. If you do need to pick your rabbit up never pick it up by the ears, neck or hind legs. Always use both hands to pick your rabbit up and always use one hand to support the bulk of the animal’s weight at its bottom so that the backbone is supported. The best and safest way to pick up a rabbit is to grasp the loose skin on the scruff of the neck and press gently down until the rabbit relaxes. Whilst one hand is holding the scruff at the nape of the neck, place the other hand under the hind feet and rump. Bring the rabbit close to the handler’s body so that the animal is cradled in one arm. Rabbits that are not picked up properly can kick out and scratch the handler with their hind feet. You can give your rabbit affection that it will enjoy by stroking and patting it at ground level.<br>  <br>  Grooming<br>  <br>  Daily grooming is essential for long-haired rabbits to help keep their coat in good condition. Using a stiff brush, gently remove dead hairs, tangles and pieces of twigs, dry leaves or burrs.<br>  <br>  During grooming take the opportunity to check your rabbit's health and to ensure that it is free from external parasites. Also check the length of your rabbit's toenails and, if found to be overlong, have them clipped by a veterinarian or someone experienced in clipping. Daily handling and grooming is important in building your rabbit's confidence and for developing a friendly and social rabbit.<br>  <br>  Feeding<br>  <br>  The main part of a rabbit’s diet should consist of rabbit pellets, several types of hay (lucerne, meadow and oaten), grass and/or clover. RSPCA endorses the Peters range of rabbit and Guinea pig pellets that are available in |`|AA10356572	here is a picture of our bunny Marissa...<br>  <a href="http://www.picable.com/Nature/Animals/A-Sophisticated-Bunny.243569" rel="nofollow">http://www.picable.com/Nature/Animals/A-...</a><br>  yes they are good pets.. NEVER get one from a pet store - always look at a pet shelter or SPCA first.. they will also give you honest information on their care and sometimes they come with a cheaper cage.<br>  <br>  Marrissa lived in an 8ftx8ft run in the summer and small indoor cage in the winter.. but she died this summer :(|`|wZpahhHzaa	Rabbits can be good pets if you want an animal to watch and pet. Remember, they are prey animals so they will be a lot more skiddish than cats or dogs. Most do not like being held or in wide open spaces. They can also get hurt easily if you don't take care of them. If you get a rabbit make sure you get a lot of information on their care both from online sources, but from the pet store as well (go with pet rescue groups though, they will be more helpful in telling you what you need).<br>  <br>  I don't have a picture yet, but I have like one of those doggy pens. Its a "cage" that is really just the wall and no ground. I use extra carpet for the ground and boxes for the bunny to live in.|`|B8SMIOymaa	I think not. My cousin has a pet rabbit and all of them have ear munge.<br>  Ear munge is like your rabbit will become hairless, and make the ears grayish and it looks like the skin is going to crack. At that rate, its impossible to cuddle a rabbit. 
FcbRUYExaa	From what I have read about this fish, as incredible as they look. They are not native to the U.S, maybe some breeder will discover some way to stunt their growth or adapt them into our waters. But fish that are not native to our waters can cause problems if not regulated. Have you ever heard of animals becoming a problem when they are taken from their habitats and rreleased into another, sometimes they thrive and kill off other essential wildlife, sometimes they die or bring unfamiliar diseases not familiar to other water based life. Not to mention, their full grown counterparts (MUCHO larger than oscars) can become difficult to keep without special aquariums. <br>  BUT i am sure if you are dedicated and cant just be happy with some piranhas shipped from out of state... then fork over the money and get it approved... there are all sorts of sites for owners and their taste for exotic pets... fishy or otherwise.|`|nbtVuFVNaa	cus there be morons out there who have released them into american waters...it comes frm china and over here it can intermix with some of our fish destroying the fishes ecosystem...in the us not any more:P...but there is a fish that looks similar u'll have to raise it a bit b4 its ready to face oscars its the south american dragon goby (found at petsmart) tho ull have to bump up the salt in the tank since he is brackish, and he doesnt eat flakes..only worms only at night:D|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	I also like them, but being its a federal law that they are illegal...<br>  <br>  Last I saw, there was a guy in New York that had one. It was a family pet for 15 years. He bought it back before it was illegal, and basically, the law found out he had one. He was only charged 50 dollars for it, because of the way he took it. But it could have been up to 500 dollars. But that was only the state charge. Now he has to face the federal one. Regardless, the fish will likely end up dead by the end of it.<br>  <br>  Its not worth it. Snakehead fish are very peaceful in captivity. <br>  <br>  Its idiots that want to watch pure annihilation that ended up releasing the fish into the wild. And thats why they are now illegal.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	The reason they are illegal is because people were buying them because they were 'Cool'. But they had no idea the tank size and care they needed. So they let them go in local ponds etc where they started to breed and wipe out the local fish.<br>  <br>  So a blanket ban was placed on them.<br>  <br>  The same thing happened here in New Zealand with Koi. They were released in to large river system and have caused havoc. Being in possesion of a live one could cost you $15,000 fine or jail time now.<br>  <br>  Same thing goes with most large agressive predators, alligators, monitor lizards. Lots of folks want one, but wont commit to expense of keeping one for life.<br>  <br>  Ian
AA11887983	No.  Cats are always on top, and if they aren't it's because they don't want to be.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Not that I've noticed.  Cats don't have the hierarchical sense that dogs do.  Cats living together do not vie for the top spot.  They make their wants known on a case by case basis.
xT024KMsaa	Dogs wearing clothes to stay warm is no big deal- I do take issue with the dog in a pocketbook that is wearing a little polo, complete with popped collar.<br>  <br>  I have a dane (incredibly short coat) and will be getting  him a waterproof warmer as soon as I find one large enough. I prefer the ones that look more like horse blankets- more for the parctical owner than the fashionista, and many are for sporting dogs come with reflective strips and waterproof material outside/fleece inside.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sitstay.com/dog/supplies/servlet/CatalogSearchResultView?storeId=10001&catalogId=10001&langId=-1&pageSize=12&beginIndex=0&sType=SimpleSearch&searchType=ALL&resultType=2&searchTerm=CLHBF" rel="nofollow">http://www.sitstay.com/dog/supplies/serv...</a>|`|AA10356572	I live in Canada.... <br>  (ok okay in truth some parts of Canada are actually quite warm in the winter and dont even get snow.. but I know many Americans think we live in a giant deep freeze year long)<br>  <br>  anyhow buy the doggie a jacket! and make sure you have a dog house too.<br>  <br>  Is he a correct weight for his size? skinny dog will be colder|`|TaJWZ96paa	Just a thought: make him an area outside  with house like structure with a light in it for Warmth. You'll have to stand in the rain and cold to show him at first until he gets use to it.|`|1i8HiHHeaa	there's nothing wrong with a dog wearing a sweater or coat if you're concerned he might be cold! <br>  <br>  i have two short haired dogs who often get cold in these damp, frigid new england winters. each of them have warm fleece coats. they seem to love them & are always happy when i put them on. <br>  <br>  just make sure it fits properly & isn't a hindrance to the his' movement. if the coat gets wet, remove it & rub the dog briskly with a dry towel. |`|lhbpBnBAaa	Oh good grief. I have seen so much flack on here about dogs wearing clothes. Yes, if you are dressing your dog up as a fashion statement, that is one thing. But if you get it a sweater because the the weather outside is cold, it's fine!! It doesn't make you inhumane or cruel or Paris Hilton, it just means you don't want your dog to be cold. And just because you get your dog a sweater doesn't mean it has to be pink and have glitter on it. Just look around on the internet for medium-breed sized sweaters, I'm sure you will find plenty of variety.|`|m0k4DwHcaa	A lot of breeds have incredibly short fur with no layer of fat underneath.   They need warm coats for the colder weather -- they might also need booties.    My boxer wears a nightgown in the winter as she has little fur and no fat.   She shivers even in the heated house.|`|ixutx59Daa	Hey if the dog is cold get him a sweater or something.|`|CZTq72Kfaa	Cloth away!|`|IRfV2WF6aa	yes dogs can be afraid of rain, my dog is|`|Mx5Fo0Asaa	Well it's either put a sweater on your dog or it will continue to freeze. if your dog is big you can get a womens sweater and just put it on instead of paying big bucks for one at a store. I have a french mastiff and I am 24 years old I just put one of my turtle necks on her when it's really cold out and she is big boned. I live in Canada and would rather keep her warm then care how stupid it looks in -10 Celsius weather. |`|pGacaRuFaa	We now have a mini pin mix, and even with a sweater on, he gets a chill when he goes out in the wind. We are going to Petsmart this weekend to get him a warmer jacket. Boots are a good idea if there is snow and ice-melt on the ground. Ice-melt is toxic to dogs. I saw an article on how police dogs wear boots on the job to protect their feet, and bulletproof vests as well. Our pug got so attached to his jacket, he refused to go out the door in bad weather if I didn't put it on him. Don't let anyone rag you about dressing your dog up. If he needs it, put it on him. |`|AA10283080	Well my Great Dane has short fur and my small Chi/IG/Pug mix has short fur also. When I take them outside in the cold they hesitate because they are not fond of the cold either but I am persistent and don't allow them to chicken out because I'd rather them be uncomfortable for a small amount of time rather than to damage their bladders by holding it or going in the house. If we're going to be outside for longer than 10 minutes in the snow or freezing weather (I live in Central PA so I get some pretty bad weather sometimes) then we put on these fleece coats we got for them. Sure the coats are not the prettiest or the "manliest" but they serve a purpose. We also got them little boots to wear but unless we're going for a hike they don't wear them. Your dog may shiver and act afraid but you need to not give into it and keep making it go outside or it will never get over it's fear of the cold.
54GBWTgoaa	i cant state any facts or even give a real opinion as i have no clue what is going on, on the insides of crufts and the kennel club's practice!!<br>  all i have to go on is a documentary i watched about pedigree dogs!! and if all is true on that docu then i have a few things i disagree with, such as one breeder stating on live tv that he inbreeds his dogs and that looks are more important, and the health problems among the pug and king Charles caviler no one can deny.......left to be further investigated i think...the whole argument is rather ambiguous.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  your absolutely right, now i remember the difference between the working G.Shepherd and the showing one is huge, the showing one has a sloped back and hind legs that do NOT function properly..i saw them in the show ring and it doesn't look right when they walk...people may thumb me down and disagree with me but i ask them to go and look of health records and hereditary problems between working lines and showing lines before you say im talking crap!<br>  <br>  the working one:<br>  <a href="http://www.sapphireshepherds.com/images/About_us/3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.sapphireshepherds.com/images/...</a><br>  << and i have a female working G.Shepherd in my training classes, she has a straight back and hind legs in en- linement so she can actually do agility with no arthritis.<br>  <br>  the showing one:<br>  <a href="http://www.pcgermanshepherds.com/images/German%20Shepherd%20breed/small/international%20show/2007_Siegerin_Gina_Aquamarin%5B1%5D-30.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcgermanshepherds.com/images/...</a><br>  <br>  this article is very interesting and you should have a read of it ;)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/jemima-lewis-the-British-bulldog-is-overbred-and-overfed-588909.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/com...</a><br>  << i like when she says deformed cats look bad to british eyes yet deformed dogs win prizes at crufts <<< there IS truth in this!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  and what about the Rhodesian Ridgeback >>> the clue is in the name>> this breed gets problems with their ridge and actually a ridgeless puppy is healthier than one with a ridge...and when the BBC asked a ridgeback breeder/shower ate crufts >> she said "No, then they wouldn't be the ridgeback!" << exact words..i was so shocked...and some even said they put ridgeless puppies to sleep...im sorry but WE ruin dogs one way or the other...whether we overbreed or we just don't train our dogs  ... and i say WE because whether we overbreed or even attend crufts to support such a treason......WE are all involved... the pit is banned in many countires...again WE did this!<br>  <br>  and the basset hound with role after role of skin and shot legs with a long back now give the breed problems when older...

The dog has to live up to the breed standard or else it is excused or disqualified.<br>  <br>  To me from the quoutes it sounds like it is perfectly fine to be a back yard breeder.  It is alright to not to genetic test your dogs and breed any two dogs together without considering breed standard.<br>  <br>  I don't understand why people attack the people that show their dogs when there are some great people fighting to improve the breed and breed out these genetic conditions?|`|4rwouQHOaa	The RSPCA are one step behind PETA. They will do anything for media attention, including not setting up stall at Crufts to make it seem like "they care". Ironic it took people DECADES to pull out and say "this is morally wrong". And where were all those demanding change this time last year?<br>  <br>  Sigh...<br>  <br>  "There is compelling scientific evidence that the health and welfare of hundreds of thousands of pedigree dogs is seriously compromised as a result," - Then SHOW us this evidence. A one hour, one sided program highlighting the MINORITY of breeders who don't put the health of their dogs above wining isn't evidence.|`|vwC7klVVaa	I'm affraid that there are  dog showers and breeders out there who care more about looks that the health and  wellbeing  of the dog  breeds they stay they love.  . The RSPCA have done the right thing i don't think anyone who watch the BBC1 programme about some of the terrible practice used by breeds and allowed by the Kennel Club could not have been shocked and upset. The Kennel Club really need to sort this out . I'm sure there are lots of good breeders and showers out there.|`|7b4cd4909e3fddb3fc14d5677ec83183aa	well i have many chihuahuas and 3 of them are from top crufts breeders who sold there dogs to me because they were either fat or not good enough to show therefore they didn't want them, one of which was locked in a cage all day and only let out at night, she came home with me that day, i couldn't leave her there he also told me to use tape on her ears because they didn't stand up on there own, he said this is what show breeders do.  Well if this is what show breeders do they i think im against showing. I have been to crufts and enjoyed it very much, but to be honest that was the shopping experience not the showing etc.<br>  How can we stop back street breeders when top kc dogs are being breed in such away that is irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Good question, will be interested to see who agrees, all the best Maria|`|kWwgWSSgaa	It is not fair to say that the revision of the breed standards was totally reactionary as they were already tabled to be revised. The very biased BBC program just thrust the issue into the media spotlight.....<br>  <br>  In light of the Russell Brand/Jonathan Ross debacle, it's not surprising the BBC decided not to televise Crufts. Not a huge loss, as the coverage was fairly poor.<br>  <br>  Pedigree withdrew for financial reasons as it didn't want it's brand name associated with the bad press Crufts was receiving. The RSPCA? It had a stall a Crufts, but did not have a significant presense at the show.<br>  <br>  The Bulldog, most publicised in the media, does require an adjustment to its breed standard {subject to review until June 2009} It will not render all the Bulldogs being currently bred mutts, as responsible breeders would not deliberately breed unhealthy dogs & would breed with health, stability & function in mind.<br>  <br>  In some instances the breed standard may be too vague with less responsible breeders breeding fairly poor stock. The majority of the Group Breed Standard amendments will be fairly minor & when the review is complete should make if harder for breeders to breed poor stock & easier for judges to place the best examples of a breed.|`|3qeHMWW2aa	Now as you can probably tell I am a massive Pug lover!  I met one a few years ago and fell in love straight away.<br>  <br>  I have NEVER owned a pedigree dog before this point and i have to say I really thought long and hard before getting a pug. Pugs are obviously a prime example of breeding to the standards causing long term problems. <br>  <br>  Non pedigree dogs in general live longer and have less problems which is why it is much cheaper to insure a non pedigree.<br>  <br>  I do not agree with crufts at all. I think  a dog should be judged on its character and non pedigree's should be able to compete.  Just because a dog is pedigree why does that mean it is a better working dog/ better looking show dog?<br>  <br>  It doesn't!  Crufts is a wonderful idea but instead of writing specific rules on what dogs should look like, weigh, walk like etc why not judge the dogs instead of the breed?<br>  <br>  breeding standards incourage inbreeding and who are they to say what each breed should look like?<br>  <br>  I fully support the RSPCA in this one even though I have a pedigree dogs myself.  I really think people should buy dogs as companions and choose them based on the own preferences not because of how many champions they have in there blood or how close they conform to the breed standards.|`|66c8d4fa57df4db5b69f622f0f644b9caa	Firstly the RSPCA haven't pulled out of Crufts. They have decided not to take a stall at Crufts this year. The RSPCA is not the driving force behind Crufts.<br>  <br>  I saw the programme where he made these comments and thought I recognise hime but couldn't remember from where, I suddenly dawned on me where I had seem him.

dh8QUfywaa	you don't need to boil the gravel.  just do a complete water change, use a siphon/vacuum to pull detritus from the stones.  Fill with water and of course use something that will remove chlorine.  Filling a tank and leaving the water sit for any period of time does not remove chlorine.  You must use something.  Get some cheap live plants a gold fish and maybe some sort of live food, such as blood worms.  I have a blood worm culture in my gravel.  If you look hard enough, you'll see them. The culture is in balance with the rest of the tank and you wouldn't want to put the whole container.  Feed the woms to the gold fish.  The survivors will consume garbage in the gravel as it builds up and become future food, the plants remove CO2/add O2 and use the nutrients decomposing in the gravel to grow and the fish poos on everything.  You're creating a self contained biome.  The plants, gold fish and blood worms will culture the water, (After you've treated for chlorine) and prepare it for new tropical fish.  And of course test PH after about 10 days before spending any money on fish.  Take a sample to a fish store that tests water for free.  Most will do this.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Sorry about your fish.<br>  <br>  In hindsight, and for anyone else that has the same disaster, you should have done the 100% water change right away and the fish would probably have survived. But too late now.<br>  <br>  Dont boil the gravel, just wash it in water untill it's clean of cookie gunge. If you boil it (and have replaced the filter) you will need to cycle the tank again for the new fish. If you keep the gravel wet and just wash it you will still have some cycle.<br>  <br>  Letting the water sit will remove plain chlorine, but not chloramine. So it depends how your water company treats the water. If they use Chloramine then you MUST use water conditioner. If not, then 24hrs is enough to remove the last traces of normal chlorine.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Ian|`|SZOMVGBRaa	If your not using a water conditioner its no wonder they are dead. YOU MUST USE WATER CONDITIONER !!!! Letting the water sit won't evaporate everything that will kill the fish.  <br>  <br>  That's kinda scary that the cookies killed the fish, makes you wonder what they put in those things huh lol. You should just vacuumed up the cookie vs trying to pull it out. Its like a total DUH moment when you reach to pick up a cookie and it breaks apart. Haven't you ever dipped a cookie in milk before ? LOL  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and you don't need to boil the gravel but you should take it all out and rise it well, clean the tank and then let it cycle with the conditioner water for at least three weeks with one or two cheep fish before re-stocking. |`|BTzKG0raaa	I would clean the gravel again. Juss to make sure its all gone.<br>  and yes. its a good idea to leave for 5 days. even get goldfish to egt some ammonie into it|`|101bfea0cfc2e9bab98441d37836406eaa	Ah two year olds! Doncha just love'em?<br>  He was probably trying to give the fish their dessert!<br>  <br>  A cloth, as opposed to netting, type net (brine shrimp net) might have helped you get more of that cookie residue out, but if that would have saved the fish, there's no knowing.<br>  <br>  I would do the 100% change, but I would NOT rinse out the tank, decorations and gravel with tap water. I would also use a water conditioner rather than do the 5 day thing. I would also rinse my filter media in the old tank water, not tap water.<br>  <br>  My reasoning here is to preserve as much of your good bacteria as possible. The good bacteria (which are what cycle your tank) live in the gravel, on the decorations and in the filter media, and tap water will kill them.<br>  <br>  Preserving the good bacteria will go a long way to cutting your new cycling time down.  An investment in some BioSpira (fridge at PetCo), will also help cut your cycling time.<br>  <br>  I would do that and skip using a goldfish and go with the hardiest of whatever you want to keep to finish the cycle and test, test, test. I think the barbs are probably the hardiest of what you had in there. You probably know to add the other fish a few at a time, testing, and giving the cycle time to catch up, between additions.|`|AA11399195	No need to boil anything.Don't know how big your tank is but here is how i<br>  do i complete change on a 3 foot one.Remove all the ornaments plants etc<br>  Filter thermo.Turn off and remove heater first.Put a couple of sponges on<br>  the bottom of my shower for one end to rest on and prevent from cracking.<br>  Turn on shower and tip up to empty when getting filled moving the gravel<br>  with hands to get it cleaned.When the water is clear clean.Empty and put<br>  the tank back on stand.Fill with warm water boiled and mixed with cold.Put<br>  the heater in.You will after cleaning the filter replace the filter pads with new.Put in plants etc and have it all running.Put in tapsafe or what you<br>  use to deal with the chlorine.Put amount of Tonic in.Then i put my fish <br>  back.Never had a problem.So once your clean get your fish.

It really depends on the species and sex whether or not the bird is going to talk.  Cockatiels for example, the female doesn't usually talk or sing, just chirp or chatter.  I got a male from an egg, took him home at 16 weeks and began whistling 1 tune to him any time I could spare.  I also repeated words, like "peek a boo," "Where is big bird?"  "Give me kiss" Whatever you want.  Practice, record your voice, play the tape (or you can get tapes at the pet store).<br>  <br>  I also have a parrot, her brain is bigger and she talks, chatters and learned all fof this on her own by listening.

SZOMVGBRaa	Well my answer's gonna be allot shorter and simpler but its the best one.<br>  <br>  Albino Bristol Nose Pleco, the premier Algae eating machine. Stays under 4 inch's and is peaceful to all fish. On top of that hes got enough spunk to live with Cichlids of any type. Plus they are Cheap, Cheap, Cheap, about 5 dollars.  Do yourself a favor and get one. Best of Luck|`|oMmBhWK4aa	Note that there is no algae eating creature that eats all types of algae, so the best solution is to assemble a team of different algae munchers. My suggestion would be one true Siamese algae eater (don't be conned with other fish that look similar, like garras), 3-5 Amano (aka Yamato) dwarf shrimps and 2 otocinclus midget sucker catfish. Make sure your water quality is good for the otos as they're quite sensitive. As most tanks don't have enough algae, drop in an algae or spirulina wafer every few days. Since you already have snails, forget about more or else you could also consider a few nerites, which don't breed in freshwater.<br>  <br>  Avoid Chinese algae eaters (gets mean when older & soon prefers fish food over algae), pleco (most of them get way too large & poop too much). Certain sharks are good algae grazers but get aggressive towards other fish. Besides Amano shrimps, there are other choices but these smaller ones may end up as fish snacks and some like the cherry shrimp are very prolific breeders.|`|h6bJ8RVoaa	umm well, algae eaters?<br>  <br>  usually i would suggest otocinclus, these are small and cute suckermouth catfish and they are 150% peaceful... but they are best when with their group, 3 as a minimum...<br>  <br>  there are shrimps capable of tackling algae, such as amano or red cherry, but since you have kribensis which is chiclid, i'm worried that it may prey on the shrimp...<br>  <br>  so the last idea i can give you is american flag fish (jordanella floridae), these are small killifish, max size 6cm. they can be alone since the males are basically territorial (don't worry these guys won't hurt your other fish, they just defend their tiny area)... <br>  <br>  if i had another idea i'll add my answers.... good luck!|`|nbtVuFVNaa	go to petsmart and get 1-2 mystery snails or right next to them somewhere is a fish with the name alge eater:P its 2-4$...or if u go on the days ur local petsmart gets its shipment of fish u can ask if they have any crawdads...but thats only if u get a pleco:D|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Try a Bristlenose Pleco. should be readily available in NZ, stays small and actually eats some algae.

MzHwklzKaa	With a filter, you should get 2 Zebra Danios<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2 Leopard Danios<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  2 neon Tetras.<br>  <br>  That's it.  Those are your fish choices, and only 2 will fit in that tank.<br>  <br>  No goldfish.  Each one needs 20 gallons all to itself.  They grow huge, and poop a lot.  They'll poison a 1 gallon in a day or 2.<br>  <br>  Algae eaters also get huge.  They also poop and dirty the water.  They cause more mess than they clean.  Skip them.<br>  <br>  Don't change all of the water.<br>  Ever.<br>  Change out about 10% once a week.<br>  <br>  Throw away the 1 gallon.  They're death traps, even with filtration.  <br>  10 gallon tanks are really as small as you want to go.  5 gallons if you don't have the space, and you feel lucky.|`|1D8tMCYIaa	Well, with a 1 gallon, you really can only put 1 small fish in there.<br>  <br>  Algae eaters like plecos will grow out of that tank and they usually need tanks around 70 gallons so scratch that. I don't know about goldfish all that well, but they are too big for a 1 gallon too.<br>  <br>  If you really want some fish, read up on the Nitrogen cycle and fish profiles so you know what can live in a small tank and how big certain species of fish get.|`|AA11434640	A one gallon tank wouldn't work for either of the fish you mentioned. Honestly, I don't think it'd work for any kind of fish. It's a even a bit small for a betta...Bettas need at least 3 gallons and a heater (in my opinion)<br>  <br>  Also, the most water you should change at one time is 25%. Anything more than that will be stressful to the fish.|`|nHp8zzkjaa	No too small the tank really is not even big enough for one gold fish. a rule of thumb is 1 gal of water per 1 inch of fish and algae eaters have to have a heater just in case room temp gets too cold.|`|cRDFfjFBaa	The best fish for your tank would really be a Betta aka Chinese Fighting fish. You can only have one per tank but they are always colorful and easily taken care of. You could also have the snail in there to help keep the tank clean.  Gold fish really require 20 to 30 gallon tanks and would eat any snails put in with them. Algae eaters vary but even common plecos require at least a 10 to 20 gallon. A good site to look on with forums on setting up fish tanks is AquariaCentral.com good refrence site and good for beginners starting up their first tanks.|`|2Bb9GnCLaa	NO! The 2 goldfish would need a 30 gallon each AT LEAST. The algae eater would need a large tank, eg 55 gallons plus, depending on size of species... the snail would be all that could live in that small of a tank.|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Sorry but a 1gal tank is a death trap for pretty much ANY fish.<br>  <br>  A betta might survive, but the temp is a bit cool for them really.<br>  <br>  Do yourself and the fish a favour and throw the 1gal tank away.

There is only one vet that comes on here very rarely and even if lots of vets came on they wouldn't diagnose over the internet-it's not possible. there are a number of serious diseases that have those symptoms and without a physical exam and tests there is no way to tell.Even if by some miracle someone could diagnose your cat, it would still need veterinary treatment so really it wouldn't help. The best thing you can do is give your cat up to a shelter and hope it can be saved or if need be, euthanised. You certainly shouldn't have 6 cats if you can't even afford to look after one-it's irresponsible and not fair on the cats. Sorry if you think that's harsh but I think letting your cat get into that state (they don't get very emaciated overnight) is cruelty.|`|5RRMLzvzaa	Those can be symptoms of a lot of things.  The point is, even if we could figure out what it is, without your vet's help, you probably can't treat it.  Blood tests are often needed to diagnose the problem, and medicines or other treatments you can only get with a vet's prescription might be all that can help.<br>  <br>  I'm not a vet and don't know everything, but I do know there are several things that can have symptoms like that, such as kidney failure (which I know about as I have a cat with kidney failure).  A lot of the things that could be causing those symptoms are actually pretty easy to treat and the cat's life can be prolonged for a very long time (like years) with treatment.  My cat's kidney failure is pretty inexpensive to treat, too... costs me about $6 per month for her fluids, needles, and meds.  <br>  <br>  There's not much we can do to help, but your cat will not last much longer if she's not eating for sure.  To help with hydration, I recommend switching to an all-canned food diet (all my cats eat only canned anyway, it's better for them) and if she won't eat what you offer, try fancy feast - it's cheapest bought in the big box at walmart - and fancy feast is often the only thing that will entice a very sick cat to eat.|`|wDmNpO8Gaa	It seems that your kitty is sick, BUT since we're not vets here in answers we cannot help him.

Is your cat's gums and tongue pale? If it is, then your cat has a low blood cell count and you have to rush her to the vet immediately! Unfortunately, there is no cure for Feline Anemia, but your cat can get a blood transfusion which will last for a limited amount of time.<br>  <br>  Diabetes: The cat fits Lethargy, weakness, and maybe difficulty in jumping. Is he walking on his hind ankles instead of her hind legs. When cats have diabetes, they will have nerve damage to different areas of their bodies and a sign that he has nerve damage is the walking position. Also, is he urinating and drinking more than usual? That's another sign of diabetes because when cats have to urinate more, they get more thirsty and drink more, even when they are dehydrated..<br>  <br>  Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA): When the cat's body is using up energy from fat, the breakdown creates chemicals called ketones, which build up in the blood and urine. Does she have a fruity breath, having diarrea, and/or vomiting? If she does, then she may have this condition and in this case you have to rush her to the vetenarian pronto. If not treated, then she could fall into a coma and die.<br>  <br>  I do hope your kitty gets better. I'll post more when I get more information.|`|5XnypZkVaa	One thing that fits those symptoms is a tumor or cancer. If you don't want to lose your cat then take it to the vet.

n8jrLDblaa	The crate is intended to provide a safe 'den-like' environment for your dog when you are unable to supervise. Generally, the crate is used indoors....not when the dog is outside in the yard. Here are some crate training basics for you to read over. Keep in mind, crate training an adult dog will be a huge challenge for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.inch.com/~dogs/cratetraining....</a>|`|XKNQkwuGaa	u can use either one, just make sure there is enough room for ur dog to stand and move around so he will be comfy.i have a wire pen for my border collie that is roomy enough for her to be content until i come home. i keep it in my living room an she goes in for a few hrs when i go out or she will destroy my house.crates are for indoors so the dog will stay warm and have its toys and treats when u are gone and they will be safe.ur dog is older so he will have to get use to being confined in it so when u get one place a nice blanket and feed him his treats and toys in it and keep the door open all the time u are home so he can go in and out for snacks and quiet times.my b c was trained at a young age to go in hers and as soon as she knows i have to leave she goes and gets in it and waits for her treats. she will also go and nap through out the day since she is quite comfortable and this is her own special spot. it takes time for ur dog to adjust being locked in so try for short periods until he gets use to the pen and have lots of treats and toys to keep him busy and keep a radio or tv on for company. good luck|`|s76aC4G8aa	Crate training is training the dog to accept the crate has his home.  You don't just shove one in there and lock the door and leave, no you will cause stress and frustration and the dog can and will chew his way out of the crate to escape.  I've seen dogs do severe damage to themselves trying to escape a crate.<br>  <br>  Remember a dog should never be in a crate for more than 3 hours, and if you are using the crate outside I hope you don't plan on leaving him locked inside a crate with no protection from the elements like sun, cold and rain and with no access to water or bathroom breaks?<br>  <br>  I've attached a link on how to crate train.  With an adult dog it takes months for them to "accept the crate" without issues.  If done properly.|`|pGacaRuFaa	I've never had a problem crate training my dogs. I would keep the crate indoors, however. Wire crates cannot be used as a dog house. I use a treat to get the dog to go in willingly, and the first few times he goes in, I don't shut the door. The crate is where I always feed my dogs, because otherwise the cats steal their food. You can get dishes that attach to the cage wire, so the dog doesn't have to trip over them. Don't use a rabbit bottle for water, it could put his eye out. Make sure you have sturdy bedding and some chew toys for entertainment. After a while, all I would have to say is "In" and my dogs would go to their proper crates and sit inside waiting for their dinner. Our newest dog is still in the howl at night phase, but he is getting the hang of it.|`|2n0B4cY6aa	Crates are great...they provide a safe little den for the dog where they can go when your not about...for safety etc and also when they want time out.<br>  I would recommend getting a crate with a divider,like i have for my 7 month labrador so that as the dog grows so does the crate, if you get a crate too big then they tend to toilet in it, it should be big enough for dog to stand, turn around and lay down and thats it.|`|LxKGg6P7aa	Putting a dog in a crate is cruel.  Get rid of him to a safe, non-kill shelter. You can't cope, and he shouldn't suffer for it.|`|m0k4DwHcaa	I foster dogs for a rescue, so there are usually new dogs in the pack.<br>  All dogs are crate trained when they arrive, as I want to make sure they are all safe when I'm not around to supervise.   My own dogs will often just go into their crates to get away from the others into their very own space.   They all learn very quickly the crate is a place to get treats and quiet.    Just a caution about crates -- my basset got his tags caught in the wires and was in great distress when I found him.   I've gotten rid of the metal crates and use the molded plastic ones.<br>  c|`|AS3QGh4taa	I have a beagle puppy. He uses the crate to sleep in. To have a place of his own so he doesn't get on the furniture. Some ppl just use it until the dog is house trained, meaning he knows he has to go outside to do his business. Make sure no food or toys are in it. He'll get in an excited state, they should always be calm in a crate. Hope this helps.
Zv4tZ0tZaa	Try pinching her toes. if she doesn't respond to that, her spinal cord may be inflamed or broken. My parents just had to have one of their dachshunds put down because he couldn't use his back legs anymore. I would put her in a pet carrier and wait for the vet to open. DO NOT LET HER MOVE and watch that you don't jostle her back. It could be that this could be cleared up with steroids. Be VERY careful of her back.|`|hHbrRiefaa	It sounds like a problem with her back; either a herniated disk or muscle sprain.  It's a good idea to get her to your vet asap!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	It could be a lot of things but it sounds like a serious problem when a normally energetic dog suddenly isn't.

Cheep easy and you will never run out.|`|4360cf3c4091cff956ff8bf91dd7789faa	There isn't any harm done feeding kibble as treats, although your dog might like a difference from dry kibble. I know when our dog is anticipating dinner, he refuses his regular kibble as a treat. |`|fys4qM9Faa	No. It's actually recommended.|`|ATXFFFs3aa	I have been using normal canned dog food.

pDKm9Wmgaa	Have you changed this cat's diet recently? Is anything in his life different? Moved recently, loss of a life long companion, divorce? <br>  Cats, especially older cat do not handle stress well. <br>  Changing his diet, either to dry or canned, will not solve the problem. I'd like to know what the vet said the problem was, and the reason for the steroids. <br>  For a cat his age, bloodwork should have been done. A full chemistry panel, CBC (Complete Blood Count), and a thyroid panel, to rule out the obvious. Then the vet should have prescribed a bland diet of rice and boiled chicken. The rice helps bind up the stools while the chicken gives the necessary protein. Boiling removes the fat, which can make the diarrhea worse. If the steroids don't make an improvement in around 2 weeks, I would ask your vet for further testing, starting with abdominal x-rays. From there, if nothing shows up on the x-rays, a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen should be done. From there, a colonoscopy would be done. <br>  Let me explain the progression of these tests. <br>  Yes, the tests ARE expensive. And they get more expensive as you go on. HOWEVER; it will do your cat (and your wallet) NO GOOD to jump ahead in the progression of these tests. By jumping to the colonoscopy before doing the x-rays (as an example), you will be spending money on a test that the x-rays may have spotted the problem. By going in progression, your vet is ruling out what the problem is not. <br>  Also, if your vet is unwilling to do more than just prescribe steroids, you may want to seek another opinion. You will also want to seek the opinion of a Veterinary Internal Medicine specialist if your vet does not do sonograms or Colonoscopy. <br>  As long as he is eating, affectionate, and active, that's all good. If he becomes depressed, less active, or his appetite falls off, get him to the vet right away. <br>  Good luck. I hope you find the cause. |`|qOm71Iioaa	if he eats canned food it should be switched to plain dry, no milk, and a small teaspoon of sour cream usually helps any kind of stomach problems my cat has.|`|V5tu7q6caa	1st i would advice to talk 2 the vet...  the medicine dose might  not b suitable for him or anything.

Go to <a href="http://catinfo.org" rel="nofollow">http://catinfo.org</a> and learn how to feed your cat.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that the others on here that recommended dry food go to that site and read about how dry food will kill your cat.|`|T1Tjq0Ffaa	switch him to dry food, keep plenty of fresh water available for him.

In a way it is almost worse than losing your pet...he is my baby, and it is almost like you are leaving your son to go to school. i am afraid he will miss me too much, or what if he forgets me? I will miss laying in bed with him at night, pplaying with him, caring for him... even talking to himm. He has always been there for me - when somehing sad has happened I'll cry with him..a pet is the bet kind of comfort and love you can ever find.

The process of grieving the loss of a pet can be just as intense. <br>  <br>  The one thing you got and you will always have is his memories.  <br>  When you experience pain, its the bodies way of reminding us in a good way even though it hurts...<br>  <br>  I lost a hamster when I was a kid ~ today 30yrs later, I can still remember the way his nose twitched,  the smell of his fur, and the fact that at night when I went to bed ~ I put him under the covers with me and in the morning always found him on my pillow, his name was Fluffy.

I asked where she was and my mom and dad said we had to get rid of her. I cried for about 3 days and could not stop thinking about her.

Last month, I lost my first ferret, so I can totally relate to what you're going through. The ferrets (I have four others still with me) were the first pets that were "mine" and not just "family pets" and with everything involved in caring for them, they really are like my children. Losing Zoey (my ferret that passed last month) was probably the hardest loss I went through so far. She had been to the vets a few days prior, the vet gave me some meds, but Zoey just wasn't getting better, so I rushed her back a couple days later. I left her there feeling relieved, thinking that she was going to be ok, only to awake to a phone call at 8:45am the next morning from my vet saying that Zoey had passed in the middle of the night - thinking that she was going to be ok and not being able to be there to hold her when she did pass made losing her that much harder. Just like you, I still cry when I think about her. I'm so sorry for loss, it really is the hardest part of being a pet owner. You just have to remember the good times with Hans and know that because of you, he had a great life while he was here. I'm sure your Hans and my Zoey are up with all the other little ferrets causing all sorts of mischief and having a ball! =)|`|vdXokbmHaa	My cat misty, omg i loved her so much,  she was an outdoor cat and when ever my dad let her in the house she would run to my room sit by my door and meow till i opened the door and let her in... unfortunately she was attacked by another animal.... *tear* i miss her so much.

It's so painful to lose a pet..<br>  Maybe this poem will help you. I didn't write it, someone showed it to me. It really helped me.<br>  <br>  Just this side of heaven is a place called Rainbow Bridge. <br>  <br>  When an animal dies that has been especially close to someone here, that pet goes to Rainbow Bridge. <br>  There are meadows and hills for all of our special friends so they can run and play together. <br>  There is plenty of food, water and sunshine, and our friends are warm and comfortable. <br>  <br>  All the animals who had been ill and old are restored to health and vigor; those who were hurt or maimed are made whole and strong again, just as we remember them in our dreams of days and times gone by. <br>  The animals are happy and content, except for one small thing; they each miss someone very special to them, who had to be left behind. <br>  <br>  They all run and play together, but the day comes when one suddenly stops and looks into the distance. His bright eyes are intent; His eager body quivers. Suddenly he begins to run from the group, flying over the green grass, his legs carrying him faster and faster. <br>  <br>  You have been spotted, and when you and your special friend finally meet, you cling together in joyous reunion, never to be parted again. The happy kisses rain upon your face; your hands again caress the beloved head, and you look once more into the trusting eyes of your pet, so long gone from your life but never absent from your heart. <br>  <br>  Then you cross Rainbow Bridge together.... <br>  <br>  Author unknown...|`|jC7C2V6Taa	well, i lost my pet that i had for five years, i realize that its hard. I know what your going through and its really difficult. I guess my advice to you is to find something to do with your time, like get involved with some sort of club or hobby, or take up some sport. Just do something that will really get you involved with something that will take up your time and energy. That's what I did. Good Luck|`|DvoP2aawaa	Oh yes, I lost my cat in may, even though it was awhile ago, i still miss her big time.<br>  When she died we buried her in the backyard and planted a cherry tree over the grave.

Even if she's not, make sure that she's nice and settled before you try to handle her too much. <br>  <br>  Her behavior is indicating that she's scared, by the way.<br>  <br>  When she's nice and settled, and i mean REALLY settled, dont try to ruch it. try holding her for shot periods of time, not moving or doing ANYTHING scary. <br>  <br>  For the tank cover thing, i imagine it makes a noise (mine sure does) and like i said, she's just not used to it yet. Give the little lady some time!|`|htD82ij1aa	I have two leopard geckos and they don't to that, is it an adult, it sounds like it doesn't like being handled, where did you get it, it might not be used to human contact if the last owner just put it in a tank and fed it, not handling it.
01nMRPHVaa	Hey<br>  <br>  ****GOOD STARTER SNAKE CHOICES****<br>  Ball Python (also Royal Python) (<a href="http://reptilemania.net/ball%20python.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://reptilemania.net/ball%20python.jp...</a><br>  This is my personal recommendation for a good beginner snake. I have had several of these and have had very few problems with them. They tend to be very calm and rarely bite unless they are provoked. They are also fairly slow moving snakes. We would often let ours sit out while we worked in the house and it would just curl up and hang out (although you should never leave a snake unattended). I would recommend buying one that is slightly older (i.e. not a hatchling) because they are much more likely to survive and to eat well. Don't buy a wild caught snake, they can be hard to tame and are much less likely to eat regularly. These snakes eat mostly mice (but some prefer birds) and only grow to be 4 or 5 feet long. Just remember that this is a long commitment, because these snakes can live to be 30 years old if cared for properly. <br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kingsnake.com/ballpythonguide...</a><br>  <br>  Corn Snakes (<a href="http://fohn.net/corn-snake-pictures-facts/corn-snake-pictures/baby-corn-snakes-800x600.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://fohn.net/corn-snake-pictures-fact...</a><br>  These are good starter snakes because they are readily available and also stay fairly small. This also means they eat less food and require a smaller tank for proper care. These snakes are fairly calm and are generally very good eaters (in case you don't want to have to worry about tricking your snake into eating). They also can be kept in many environments, so they are less likely to get ill from an improper environment (but a responsible owner should try to keep them as comfortable as possible). <br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnakes/a/cornsnakes_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/cornsnake...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Milk Snakes (<a href="http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/stories/Snake/pueblan-milksnake-2.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://www.reptilesweb.com/images/storie...</a><br>  These snakes are small and easy to maintain. They require a dry environment with little light, so you don't have to worry about keeping up the humidity or turning the lights on and off. They do just fine with alternative heating sources, but you will need some light if you're keeping live plants. Just remember that milk snakes are gifted escape artists, so you need to provide a very secure environment to keep them from wandering away. "<br>  <br>  Care Guide:<br>  <a href="http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/snakes/a/kingmilksnakes_2.htm" rel="nofollow">http://exoticpets.about.com/cs/snakes/a/...</a><br>  <br>  ****POOR STARTER SNAKE CHOICES****<br>  Reticulated Pythons, Common Or Red Tailed Boas, Rock Pythons, Burmese Pythons <br>  While some of these snakes (especially the boas) can be quite tame, they are still quite large. A full grown reticulated python requires several people to be handled safely. Even if proper precautions are taken, there is little you could do to stop the snake if they decided to constrict. Plus, even if they don't usually bite, a bite from a snake that large is much harder to care for than one from a small snake. They also require very large enclosures and the food is generally quite pricey. <br>  <br>  Rainbow Boas, Emerald Tree Boas, Green Tree Pythons <br>  While these snakes do not get very large, they don't always have very good temperaments and could do a lot of biting depending on the snake. These snakes can also be very fast and hard to handle outside of their tank. <br>  <br>  These are just a few recommendations; you don't need to limit yourself. Just be sure to do as much research as you can on the snake you decide to get. Know before you buy what care they require and be sure you are able to provide it.|`|niztxto9aa	I definitely would agree that a ball python would be a perfect starter when looking for something that doesn't get to big and isn't to small. The first step is getting one that is a few months old and is eating well. Bp's like to hide so make sure that their enclosure has a couple hide boxes. One under it's basking spot and one on the cool side. Bp's can live comfortably in a 20 gallon tank for quite a while. They are very docile and for the most part will not show aggressive behavior unless feeding. They are very easy to take care of and do not require any significant keeping skills.|`|TnEtH1aUaa	ball python dude hands down best pet snake dont get to big and not to small|`|wZKb8egaaa	Here are some pretty docile snakes 5ft and below in length:<br>  Garter Snake (3-4ft)<br>  Hog Island Boa (4-5ft)<br>  Children's Python (2-3ft)<br>  Sand Boas(3-4ft)<br>  Blood Python (4-6ft)<br>  Ball Python (4-5ft)<br>  Corn Snake (4-5ft)<br>  <br>  All of these snakes (excluding the garter snake & children's python) need at least a 55 gallon tank, the blood python may need a tank slightly bigger.<br>  The garter snake and Children's Python will only need a 30-40 gallon tank.<br>  They all live between 15-30+ years so these are lifetime commitments.<br>  <br>  Good luck and please be sure to do tons and tons of research before you buy the snake you choose!|`|sSJ8zfebaa	dont get a ball python-look at all the questions asked on them-i have 6.they are a pain with feeding and shedding.corns are nice but my favorite is my california king.great eaters and they love to be handled.
AA11901352	Have you tested your water?  The air bubbles aren't an issue and won't rip the tail.  The tail issue seems like fin rot which is usually caused by poor water quality.  You need to remain on a weekly 25% water change.<br>  <br>  If your fish is turning milky color it could be the start of a fungus or even ich.  You need to test the water.  Look closly at your fish you will have to determine if it is the start of ich or a fungus.  Keeping the water quality high is important.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	its the kind of water try filtering it lol|`|JEaTBC8Vaa	Its your water quality. Fish do that when the water quality is bad. You need to check your water right now. Also if you have stress coat or aquarium salt add it to the tank as directed by the bottle. This will help destressify him. Then after checking your water fix the problem. I usually  do it slowly being the sensitivity of my fish(discus), but if you think that your fish can handle it then go and fix it! Good luck to you???????????????

Ours always come to the window with mice and we say good boy and thank you but you can't bring it in. Then when they've gone off again we just get rid of the present lol|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Toby loves you! He is showing you how much by presenting you with these gifts of dead mice that he slaved to catch. He's also showing off, as if to say "hey! look what I caught!" <br>  <br>  Tell Toby that he is a good boy and thank him for the present. You won't be able to stop this behavior because it is engraved deep within your cat's natural instincts.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	He's not scaring you.  He's bringing food back to the family.  It's a compliment.<br>  <br>  As for stopping it... I'm not sure on that, but it's a common problem, so I'm sure people have come up with solutions.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	He loves you. He's contributing to puting food on the table. It's his way to say thank you.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	Actually they are "gifts" for you.  I don't know exactly what the reasoning is but I know that he is trying to be a good kitty not scare you.|`|2cFnDkCkaa	my dogs do the same thing ok this is y any animal does that its because they love you and just want to show there appreciation by bringing an other animal to you for a gift|`|mzQhw8pLaa	He wants to show his bravier to you!|`|VRipScGTaa	i dunno|`|hCJ66msnaa	its in a cat's instinct to catch mice. the reason he is bringing them for you to see is not to scare you it is because he wants  your praise for doing something good. as for how to stop it i dont think there is a way to stop it. it is just what cats do and have been doing for a very long time.|`|Ov5nCTUxaa	its natural, cats are predators and will hunt mice, small rabbits rodents etc. he brings them home to you as his away of saying'' look mum im a good boy''<br>  <br>   sometimes he may not kill them but play with them, other time he may play then kill and eat it. its what cats do.|`|9PChI0Bxaa	He is not doing it to scare you. Your toby is just trying to prove to you he is a good hunter/gather and can provide for the family. Animals don't see us as human, but rather as a position in their social order. Basically, its a gift from him to you.|`|AG6LWcgRaa	its there ingstints. im not really a cat person but you could try and buy him some more toys to play with and pay him more attention, if not already more.  You can buy a toy mouse with cat nip inside and im sure he will loveee that :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped xx|`|gdxkIGhGaa	My cat used to do that to,he just does that because cats don't just eat food they hunted were they got it, that cause terratorial(excuse my horrible spelling) problems. Your land, to them, is there's, no other cat can come a get they're food.|`|HcboXOmjaa	My parent's cat does that too. And birds that aren't dead. haha. They do this because they want to show you what they did because they think you will praise him for it.  So tell him good job but make it clear to him that he shouldn't bring mice in the house.|`|pzhnKxxGaa	hes bringing them to you as gifts to show you he cares for you and that hes a clever cat he thinks that u will b happy and proud that he brought it in for you but unfortunately you wont b able to persuade him otherwise|`|86yjOpB5aa	he wants to show you that he is a real cat<br>  <br>  my cat use to do that all the time<br>  <br>  just tell him you proud and show him love and affection<br>  <br>  just keep him happy|`|0Rr93zbwaa	as you already know, it's a gift. but I read somewhere that it will hurt the cats feelings if you throw the mouse away in front of him. instead, wait til he walks away, and then dispose of it.|`|ByxEE8eeaa	He probably thinks he's bringing you a nice present. My friend's cat does that, then the mice run away and colonize his walls. I'm not sure how to prevent that.|`|Hz2ZRW4Saa	Its a present! My cats wonder why i am angry and not praising them. At least yours is mice, one of my cats bought a semi alive pigeon through the cat flap once! Feathers were everywhere!!|`|Cg0S7F2Haa	i think she is bringing you presents also they love to play with them its the natural hunting instinct in them|`|2vBmRcv6aa	He's just trying to  "chip in" because you bring him food all the time.  I have had lots of cats do that.|`|itViz7Gwaa	ur cat proberbly thinks hes doing u a favour by bringing the dead mice inside where u can watch him eat them <br>  <br>  i guess it sorta like with my dog she'll lick my feet thinking shes cleaning them|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Your cat is catching them for you. Your cat sees you as his master/mother and catches things so you can be proud of him. I have 3 cats and they all do this. They'll bring dead birds, chipmunks, mice, etc. and leave them on the front porch for us. It's so gross but they really don't know any better. Just make sure that when you let the cat in, he doesn't have something in his mouth. If he does, make him drop it first.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It's a gift. not kidding. he is feeding you. just say thanks !
Tem3NzE2aa	First of all, don't panic - you are doing your best and you obviously care.  <br>  Keep his temp up - 31 degrees + seems hot, but that is what it should be - use a heat pad/ wrap a hot water bottle/wheat bag etc.<br>  <br>  Keep encouraging him onto a teat - they don't take much - 2 or 3 drops, but every drop helps - immunity etc. It sounds as if the mother is happy with this - this is the main thing.  <br>  <br>  If all fails, remember he/she might have had problems internally that you can't see, but the mother can sense - really harsh, but very common that one of the little ones don't make it - don't blame yourself.  When you can, get a can of special dog milk formula and milk or bottle, just in case any of them need it later - better to be safe than sorry. Get the vet to check them all over + mum, who has done so well! (keep her liquids up too - and lots of yummy milk enhancing things for her!) <br>  <br>  KEEP YOUR HANDS REALLY CLEAN - risk of infection is high because of your (necessary) intervention.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! This is VERY hard when you are tired and exhausted. xxx|`|IgL5G0v3aa	thats about all you can do - is try to keep him warm and dry until the vet opens, you can tryto feed him with a spoon, but be careful not to let the milk get into his lungs, by spilling it down his throught. he will die from phenomia, jsut try to comfort him all you can, try to get him to nurse his mother, then go to the vet as soon as they open.|`|7j4IJi1Qaa	Stop giving him cow's milk.  Keep him warm, warm water bottles around him, wrap him up in a blanket, etc.  <br>  Your going to need to take him to an Emergency Vet. ASAP!

First of all, put the pup in a small box with a dry towel with a slightly warm (not too hot) heating pad. The cow's milk will hurt it, so do not feed it any more of that, but go to your local pet shop and get some puppy formula and a little pup bottle. Feed the little guy every 2-4 hours. After you feed him, you will have to rub him with a warm, damp cloth. You will also have to rub his bottom to help him go to the bathroom. It will be tough, I know, but good luck!|`|b887929b2ebc558a3765f2523821bd14aa	cows milk will kill him with intestinal upset<br>  <br>  <br>  Put malcolm on the mothers teat. and hope for the best<br>  <br>  get the litter to the vet in the morning|`|1i8HiHHeaa	keep him warm & try to encourage him to feed. don't give him cows' milk - he can not digest it! in the morning you can get puppy formula at most any pet store & you may have to supplement his feeding until he's a little stronger.|`|pfJorlTIaa	Honestly, there is not much you can do.  (You were talking about the 2 day old puppy, correct?  If so, not much you can do.)  You cannot bring him outside yet to get to a vet.  <br>  With 6 puppies, there is a chance (sorry!!) that 1 may die, but not always. <br>  In the meantime, try to keep him warm with a little blanket and place him right near his mother.  He may surprise you.<br>  He may just be the runt and fully survive and thrive.<br>  Best wishes with the little guy.|`|O6DSFJbTaa	No cows milk please.  Like the above poster said, try to get her to feed off the mother.  Best of luck to you.|`|20244512d33d2e4edb6c55c4bcd03bbaaa	take him to the vet|`|jxbNUjuWaa	I have been through the exact same situation twice. You need to hold him on the teat,hold his mouth open (very gently) and push the teat in his mouth for him and squeeze the teat  for him.. very slowly so the milk doesn't come out too quick.Don't give up on him.I took my little George to the vet and they insisted i put him to sleep, but i didn't give up on him and he survived! :) Pay extra attention to him and he will pull through i promise.

AA10859773	It's true that dry food is more difficult to digest than wet food.  And it may be true that digestion becomes more difficult as cats age.  I'm not sure about that.<br>  <br>  But it's obvious that the food you're buying doesn't agree with them.  Or maybe they're sick.  I would first check with the vet on this.  It could be a sign of illness or tainted food, especially if they're all doing this, and even more likely if it started around the same time.<br>  <br>  Also, many cats have problems if you change foods on them suddenly.  That may be the cause of the problems.  Were you feeding them the same food for a long time, and then suddenly changed it?  If so, it's best to go back to the old food and gradually introduce a new food.|`|nEuKwzcqaa	do they eat wet food? i gave my 20yr old chicken and prawns on a regular basis as well as giving her a choice of wet and dry food. keep a bowl of water and if you give milk make sure it is cat milk as normal milk isn't good for them at the best of times. my girl preferred water though. you could also try mixing the dry food with a little gravy to help soften it up|`|SBEnrRZPaa	Try giving them wet food or wet their dry food. You can also get "senior" food at the vets.|`|B7U9yrLqaa	Prob best to get vet to check them then try some tuna (In water not brine) and maybe soft foods.<br>  <br>  Might just be that their digestion or teeth isn't what it was!|`|AA11005497	DO NOT give your cats MILK. as cats get older, they actually become lactose intolerant. try mixing a very tiny bit of chicken grease with the cats food just to get it moist. if that doesn't work, then you will have to buy food for cats with sensitive stomachs, but do not give your cats milk unless you want them to get horribly ill. also if you use the chicken grease and it works, you will have to change your cats food daily, as chicken grease will go rancid.|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Cats digestive needs change as they are older, so this could be the reason.  Older cats are better with wet food, as it is not so hard to digest as dry food.<br>  <br>  If they keep throwing up though, I suggest you take them to your vet, as this could indicate a problem that needs sorting out.  How long have they been throwing  up for? It could just be that the food is too rich for them, but better to be on the safe side!|`|8cikAYp3aa	you can try making your own food for them.  I did it for years and it wasn't expensive or all that time consuming.. 2 hours or so on sunday and I had food for 2 weeks,    If I cant make food for them then I feed Blue Buffalo Wilderness.  Its a super cat food, a bit pricy but 2 cats eat for a month on 12lbs|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Cats do get fur balls now and then; and the fatty content or oil in cat food does aid them in their efforts to clean up after they clean up... Get it? Don't  worry your cats will not be amused. Like the Queen of England, your cats will not be the subjects of a joke. However, if your cats are not reluctant to eat their food, the food should not be harmful because getting rid of the fur balls is very helpful for you three monarchs.
SiPZHrn4aa	If you found them in Florida, no question they are eastern glass lizards (Ophisaurus ventralis).  Also, that description sounds right but they will get around 1.5 feet longer.|`|RkK673VHaa	your description matches both Island glass snakes (ophisaurus compressus) and Slender glass snakes (ophisaurus attenuatus).
CkecSp4Uaa	Honestly, your plan kind of stinks.  Being left outside unsupervised, even in a sturdy kennel, just isn't that safe for dogs these days.  And it sounds like this dog is only going to have about 2-3 hours a day of human interaction (being in the house with you while you are asleep doesn't count)...that kind of isolation leads to a bored, destructive, and even neurotic dog.  Not the kind of things that people looking for a new pet are going to be thrilled about.  With your proposed plan this dog would be little better off than she would be in the pound.  You say you think that leaving it oustide all the time without company is cruel, but that is exactly what you are proposing to do here.<br>  <br>  Dogs smell, yes.  However, the odor should not be that strong or offensive unless there is a medical problem and just stepping up the house cleaning should be plenty to avoid any doggy odor.  Houses that get a "doggy smell" to them are houses that are not kept clean, where the animal is allowed to make messes in the house which are not cleaned up immediately, and kept closed all the time (open the window when the weather allows!).  Hard flooring surfaces are best when you have pets because they don't trap allergens or odor the way that carpeting does.  With hard surfaces all you have to do is sweep up the floors every few days and mop once a week or once every other week.  For carpets, regular vacuuming (depending on how much your dog sheds, a heavy shedder might necessitate daily vacuuming but a short haired dog that doesn't shed much might only require weekly vacuuming) should do it.  If you are concerned about odor in carpets there are several powder products on the market that you can sprinkle on the carpet before vacuuming to help with pet odors.<br>  <br>  If I were you I would keep looking for another house.  One that will allow you to keep the dog inside with you.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Are you going to bathe the dog every day?  Leaving a dog outside in a kennel will make it stink, then you aren't going to want it in the house.  Keeping the dog indoors will cut down on the dog smell on the dog.  And as long as you keep your house clean and the dog clean you shouldn't have a doggie odor in your house.  Bathing a dog every day is bad for it's skin and coat.|`|jxbNUjuWaa	That's so good that you would choose your dog over a house, so many people when they move they just get rid of their animal as if it doesn't matter to them.. so i salute you :)<br>  I think it would definitely reduce the doggy odour if you only allow her in one room.. if not there's always air fresheners :P<br>  good luck :]|`|J9AvKefwaa	Well done you for re-homing a dog, hope it goes well. I own a rescued Bichon Frise, she only really smell if she rolls in fox do-do or horse poop! My mums dog (labradinger) always STINKS! Its because of her breed type, she is forever in the water... so she is always stinking. Not all dogs stink! They tend to stink more when they are wet or damp... <br>  <br>  You can buy deodorising doggy wipes to help stop dogs stinking so much! You can also bathe them. If you keep your dog off the furniture it will help stop doggy smells penetrating everywhere. You can also use stuff to deodorise the carpets if / when they get too stinking! But it really is just part of dog owning, dogs can stink! But then so can people! Rather have doggy smells than fags, beer and BO!|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	Anytime you have a pet there is always going to be some type of odor but in general, I think the odor your landlord is probably talking about is waste odor.<br>  <br>  Most landlords are against pets because the owners allow their pets to urinate/defecate in the home itself and that is the type of odor that is hard to get out of carpets etc but it sounds like you have pretty good grasp on that.<br>  <br>  You take extra precautionary measures to reduce just plain odor their are pet whips, anti-bacterial whips w/different scents, bathing your dog once a week will reduce dander and odor - there are also pet perfumes that you can purchase - basically, keep your dog clean as you would yourself then you really should not have a problem.<br>  <br>  When talking to your landlord, let him know that you will be making an extra effort by cleaning up after your dog, keeping your dog clean as well as your home that will give him a good indication that your not only responsible but that your care as well...|`|T8M356sjaa	There are three main areas that are usually associated with a dog being smelly- ears, teeth and skin. If your dog has any brownish material in her ears she may have a ear infection. If she has tartar on her teeth or veyr red gums her teeth needs attention. If her skin is dry or has bumps on it this may be the cause of the odor|`|66wioKCJaa	I think if you keep your dog clean and wash blankets and bedding regularly you wont have a problem.  maybe when you finishing renting get the carpets cleaned.  i dont think you will have a problem at all.|`|aGZig2ngaa	if you wash your dog, and her blankets/sleeping stuff regularly, I don't think you will have any problems.|`|aZi6BvBraa	If you leave the dog outside (during they day) it will be smellier then when you keep him in the house. Outdoor dogs are way more smelly than indoor dogs. Your dog is short haired - If you make sure you dry him off after the beach or after a walk in the rain and dont allow him to roll in stuff there shouldnt be a lot of smell off him. Wash him every two - three weeks with a doggy shampoo and wash his bed regulary. I dont know if your appartment is carpeted or if you have a hard floor, its usually the carpet that the smell would stick to, with hard floors you are fine.|`|ylQXC2Mraa	as someone that cleans rental homes I have run into all kinds of pet owners. I always dread going to the ones that had large dogs or especially cats.   however there is no reason you can't have a dog and be a great renter.  if you are planning to let the dog sleep in your room then simply buy him a cedar filled bed. It will cut the doggie smell and help with fleas.These need to be refilled about every 3 months.  Use one of the flea oil treatments for your dog and don't bath him more than every other week because it will cut the effectiveness of the oil.  also use febreeze in the house along with keeping baking soda out in each room. if there is carpet then only let him lay on small rugs that you can wash each week. if he is a couch lover then cover your couch with a quilt that you can wash each week. Moping with pine sol or some kind of pine cleaner seems to help also. Vacuuming each week with a fresh bag helps too. These are some of the tips that our good renters have given me.  Hope they help.  Good luck|`|iVQULHqYaa	Dogs don't smell unless they have a problem i.e. an ear infection, bad teeth or an anal gland problem.<br>  My dogs have always lived  in the house and slept in my bedroom. At present I have only one dog and she has not had a bath for about two years. None of my dogs have had regular baths, it dries their skin and makes them itchy.<br>  My house does not smell and neither does my dog. None of my dogs have ever produced an odour.<br>  <br>  After a muddy walk I clean her off with warm water. I don't use any shampoo. I wash her bedding every week and clean her bed with vinegar.<br>  <br>  If you leave your dog outside she could be attacked by other animals, stolen or abused. She could also disturb the neighbours. <br>  You must take some time off when you get her, however if you want her to be happy when you are at work leave her in the kitchen for some of the time as she needs to be independent.

You can use a turkey baster to remove uneaten food and poop.<br>  <br>  2 females would be a VERY bad move and you'd likely end up with 3 dead fish!<br>  <br>  In the long-term you need at least a 5 gallon fully filtered, cycled (that would be the nitrogen cycle) and heated tank.|`|AA11708471	When you did your research on this fish did you not realize you are going to need a 5+ gallon heated and filtered aquarium<br>  <br>   and male bettas cnt be mixed with other bettas|`|3WD4ItHXaa	It sounds like he may be ill to me. Take a good look at him and see if there is anything out of the ordinary; gills moving really quickly, cobwebs, spots, etc. If you notice anything, a good website that could help you figure out what it is is www.bettatalk.com. As long as you are cleaning your tank when you are supposed to, and adding the dechlorinator, he should be eating. Not having a heater shouldnt be a big problem, as long as the heat in the house isnt shut off or anything. Bettas dont typically mind the colder water temp. If he is sick, though it is good to give him a heater to speed up the life cycle of the parasite. As for a betta in a bowl, i have never had problems with mine being in a bowl, as long as it is kept clean. I would try to go with maybe a 2.5 gallon at least though if possible, and it is easier to add a filter or heater in this size. I wouldnt put betta with any other fish, especially in confined space. They are really aggressive and if they mistake it for another betta, they will likely try to kill it.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	u cant put more than 1 beta fish in a tank they fight and will kill each other even if ones a girl and the others a boy it just doesnt work maybe get another fish and put it in a tank or bowl next 2 ur other fish<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!!!!|`|bD7Yaatkaa	they will eat each other silly!!!!try getting a bigger tank thats why usually the fins are droopy. also try to add some fake plant life it may help.

sBn7D0h4aa	From what i've looked up and read on it most people just say to wait it out and over time the swelling will go down. Some vets will suggest doing a surgery but the surgery will probably be more painful for her than the hematoma in the first place and the surgery could be in upwards of $800.00 and personally I could not afford that. <br>  <br>  Also an alternative very cheap method that everyone keeps talking about with these ear hematomas is a leech treatment.

We've had one cat in rescue that needed his ear amputated due to the size of the hematoma, and the fact that it was neglected for so long.  They really aren't something to ignore.  There is no home treatment, and it is not likely to just go away.  It is painful, even if you don't think so.  Cats are masters at hiding pain, as nature created them to be both prey and predator.  <br>  <br>  There's really no reason for an 11 year old cat to *not* have anesthesia, not if the vet knows what they're doing, so that isn't a reason not to have it removed.  While I understand that there are financial difficulties, it's only going to get more expensive to treat, not less.   Have you looked into Care Credit?  Have you called your local shelters to see if they have a vet on staff who'll do vet care for the public?

Breeding is not a game... it's not a matter of just putting a male and female animal together. Mess with the wrong genes and breed the wrong animals and you could end up with some very sick babies. Do you know the mom and dad's genetic/health history at least three generations back? Pet store animals should never be bred, you know nothing about their health background. It doesn't matter if they seem healthy now or the vet gave them a clean bill of health... it's what's in their genes. There are more than enough small animals in shelters and rescues without more poorly bred ones being added to the overpopulation. There's a lot more to breeding responsibly than you might think.

Make sure you do get papers with your new puppy and don't buy a dog from a pet shop(they are often from puppy mills and not healthy). Look for a reputable breeder here. Poodles are great dogs, but the toys can become little barkers if you let them. Poodles are very smart, but they do need training. Also remember that they need haircuts every 6 weeks or so and that can get pricey. My mom actually learned to clip the poodles herself( we had 2 of them), but it took her most of the day to do 2 dogs, including bathing.

IuYekkPVaa	Pretty Kitty is correct.  On June 22, 2007, the California Appellate Court ruled that cities can prohibit cat declawing without violating State law. The ruling reinstated the ground-breaking anti-declaw ordinance in the City of West Hollywood, the only one of its kind in the nation. <br>  <br>  The AVMA seem to be opposed to banning declawing, so I think it will be a long time before it's completely outlawed in the USA.  In the meantime, the most effective way for people to show their opposition to declawing is to boycott the services of those vets who condone and perform it.  According to figures from the HSUS, declawing has generated more than more than $3 billion in revenue to veterinarians, so hitting them in their pockets is one way of getting the message across.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	California passed a law allowing cities to ban declawing.

I have never heard of a whole state banning it, though.|`|lPdCTyOAaa	I think it is reasonable for a state, county, or city to ban it.  <br>  <br>  But I absolutely oppose any declawing ban passed by Congress for the entire country.<br>  <br>  Such a law would be a violation of the Constitution (not that both parties aren't spending most of their time pissing all over the Constitution.)  <br>  <br>  According to the 10th Amendment, the Federal Government does not have the power to enact such a law.  However well-intentioned it may be, the Federal Government has absolutely no business in making these decisions.<br>  <br>  Personally, I oppose declawing.  I oppose the violation of the Constitution even more.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	I know of the ban on declawing in England. As far as I know, it is not banned anywhere in the US. I had a male cat declawed about 14 years ago. I didn't like the idea then but my wife insisted. After doing it, I swore I would never do it again. It is cruel.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	nope.. its not banned in any U.S. states - it really should be.  It is unnecessary mutilation.<br>  <br>  People are more worried about their furniture then the well-being of their cats.. its so selfish and so sad<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PK- when did this happen?!  I had absolutely no idea<br>  Awww!  You got me excited!!!!! =)<br>  <br>  Add> That is so awesome!  Thank you for sharing that with us<br>  <br>  I asked that question a few weeks ago (if anyone thought it would be banned in the U.S.) a lot of pro-declawers got mad and deleted it twice... i appealed it twice and I won both times...<br>  <br>  I hope that someday it will be banned in the U.S. and most of the answers that I received on that question hoped that it would be banned as well
UNFxjNHkaa	YES - we do have pet insurance here in the U.S. -<br>  <br>  I did have it at one point but it seemed as though they would never cover any injuries that my pets had!  I think its a scam and a BIG waste of money.<br>  <br>  And yes - there is a place for people to take cats who have low income - its called SPCA - usually if you make under a certain amount of money they'll spay your cat at low cost - and we also have PLENTY of low cost vets here<br>  <br>  Correct, there is no reason that people shouldn't bring their cats to the vet if they are ill because there are low cost vets mostly everywhere!<br>  <br>  **I'm sure pet insurance is great for many people - I just had a bad experience with it.  I was paying about $100 per month to insure all of my cats - and when one of my cats hurt their leg, the insurance wouldn't cover it.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Yes, there is pet insurance available in the US.  I often recommend it to questioners.  We have several groups who advocate cats but primarily, our SPCA and Humane Societies serve all domestic animal species.  The SPCA and Humane Societies along with several private organizations and vet clinics do offer low-cost programs for spay/neuter and shots.  In hardship cases where expensive surgeries or treatments are needed to save an animal, there are animal advocacy groups who donate and help raise funds to get the treatment.  Instead of one national organization, several groups are in alliance together and help as needed and as they are able.<br>  <a href="http://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/</a>|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	There is pet insurance here but I don't have it. When one of our cats needs vet care, we just pay for it.|`|cii9XShcaa	My animal's vet offers pet insurance and it costs approx. $50 per month per cat. I didn't get it since I feel it's more practical for me to save money from my checks each month than to pay $100 for my 2 cats.<br>  <br>  For treatment at my animal's vet, it's $39 for office visit. $12 for distemper. $130 for spay. Another $40 for use of laser during spay. $99 for x-ray. $82 for a 7 month supply of flea treatment. This is what I can think of now. This is for the vet I chose. It's more or less at other vets and in other cities and states. These prices are approx the same as the other vets in my area.|`|hCJ66msnaa	no we do not have pet insurance here in the us. alot of times if people are low income and they have medical insurance for them selves it does also mean u can get shots and things for your animals at low or no cost to you. there are other times they offer free shots at a special designated place where anyone can take there pets to get them vaccinated|`|Rw7gi86Naa	I have heard of people having pet insurance here. It is more common for expensive horses, rather than cats and dogs. I wouldn't buy my cats insurance... I don't even have medical insurance, lol.|`|AA10236694	Here in Mass we have a something similiar its called Optimum Wellness Plans at Banfield the Pet Hospital its affordable preventive care programs.|`|2MvI9cpTaa	Yes we have insurance for pets in the US.  Its all private and cost alot.<br>  But we do have it.|`|m16gf9mzaa	I've found pet insurance here in the U.S. is not particularly affordable.  When I checked into for my cats, I was looking at fees of $35/month per cat.  I decided it would work better for me to just start a savings account and put in a regular amount out of each paycheck.  So far, I still could not afford to treat a long term major illness like cancer, that would cost in the multiple thousands of dollars, but now that I have this cushion, we can do regular dental cleanings in addition to annual shots and blood work for the older cat.  And in case of emergencies, there is enough there to get some diagnostic testing done, and if I can't afford a very expensive treatment, then at least I would be able to afford euthanasia if it were called for. By and large the veterinarians I have dealt with have been reasonable about discussing the costs versus the benefits of any testing or treatment they advise.  I do not feel that they look down on anyone for not having endless resources, and help me to do the best I can for my cats.<br>  <br>   In this area, rural mid-west, the ASPCA does not have the funding to offer much assistance for low-income families.|`|YBcB0732aa	Some cities have low cost animal clinics.<br>  <br>  There are pet insurance programs like aspca pet insurance in the US( <a href="http://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aspcapetinsurance.com/</a> )

9da490e6a842233912a0d962ab56a194aa	Let him go ahead and get some real action. My cousin's dog was the same way...pillows, legs, whatever he could hump, he would. Until he got it on with my dog and ever since then he's calmed down tremendously.|`|024eb6ff5426af75833ed5da331c01ecaa	It is a very natural instinct for your dog. People are the ones that have problems with that and also are embarrassed when their dog does that. It is totaly natural, it can mean a couple different things, yes one I dont have to mention but the other is to become dominant. Just as dogs will smell each others butts the also hump dogs. you have nothing to worry about. If it make you or the other owner uncomfortable, grab a treat and call the dog. The dog will stop and you are rewarding the dog for coming to  you. It is a good way to have your dog learn to come to you because if the dog thinks he/she will get a treat when called and the dog comes then he/she will start to come everytime called and that is very important!|`|3da24aae45b0340fc1a35ee92121cd8eaa	u might want to get its nuts cut off or just spray him with water and tell him no|`|5eac1be1d66378b1d48c64cbd710949daa	well if hes already nutered ur SOL <br>  <br>  ha ha ha to U <br>  <br>  he just like to get GIGGY i guess <br>  <br>  once angain ha ha ha|`|AA12182930	Depending on your dogs age you might look into having him fixed (nuetuered).  Otherwise behavior modication is your best bet.|`|5ee828923160e00596a5dfc7521b736aaa	Swat him on the behind and tell him NO, he will learn that it is not okay to do that.|`|52b9af946761900bba83243870143121aa	He's just having a little fun... my puppy has a scarf that he humps all the time.. I tie the scarf to the ceiling fan, turn it on and watch my dog try to get it down so that he can hump it...  Its very funny.  He gets so tired by the time he gets it down, he usually wants to sleep on it.  Keep him busy and he wont do it as much.. LOL  Its natural for them to do that, but kinda strange to see.  I wouldnt punish a dog for doing something that is in their nature

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Was there anything that would have frightened her inside the box?  I once found a 7 inch long centipede in my cat's litter box.  I'm not sure but you may need to buy a different box to put her mind at ease. She may be stress marking.  Sometimes the slightest things will stress a cat-things we don't even notice. I would get a Feliway diffuser (available at pet stores) and set her up in smaller space for a few days with her new litter box and all her needs.  By keeping her in a smaller area, she has less options of pooping anywhere other than her box and she won't be as likely to be exposed to whatever's bothering her.  Finally, it's always a good idea to have the vet check a cat who suddenly shows strange or inappropriate behavior.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Your cat may be ill or perhaps needs to be spayed.

aYjF2SOKaa	Before this, were they drinking normally?<br>  If you've changed their diets at all recently, they may have been slightly put off by it. Either that, or they're simply not thirsty, they could be getting all the moisture they need from their vegetables.<br>  I would suggest you check for dehydration, gently pinch the skin on the back of their necks, and when you let go, is their skin elastic, does it spring back into place, even half a second could mean dehydration.<br>  If they appear dehydrated, you must see a vet straight away, as this can be fatal to small animals, however, if they appear fully hydrated, you could try giving your vet a call, just for some advice.<br>  Also, check their eyes closely, too. Are their eyes bright, and moist looking, with no obvious discharges, etc? As this is also a good sign of health<br>  :)|`|BSVFwbE5aa	There getting the water from the food your feeding like fresh veg <br>  food , straw <br>  <br>  they'll drink water when they need it I guess<br>  <br>  Well if it's too long maybe try putting a bowl with water in it and see if they drink .<br>  <br>  Or go visit the vet .|`|yZXcvyFHaa	they are getting al there water from there veg so i would cut down on the amount of veg so that they start to drink there water again but if you notes that after a few days they are still not drinking i would take them to the vets to get them looked at|`|AA11697703	they'll be getting water from the veg, we had the same concerns but they'll drink if they need it|`|wb2nQ5jUaa	If they are getting plenty of fresh veg, especially cucumber then they are probably getting all the fluid they need from the veg.<br>  If they look health and dont seem to have any problems then just keep an eye on them but I am sure they are fine.<br>  Mine used to drink water during the summer but not a lot in the winter.

Also make sure you wash anything he wees on really, really well with biological washing powder because if they can smell anything left over they'll just keep marking it over and over again.<br>  <br>  Try and get some behavioural advice or ask your vet next time you visit as are bound to be familiar with it as I think it's common.|`|oJDtCqCQaa	Marking his territory -
8i90ov0Gaa	Uhhh, how are you "hibernating" him? I brumate my snakes (similar to hibernating) by keeping them from 45 to 60 degrees in my garage for three months and in complete darkness. As soon as I bring them back in and warm them up, they are ready to eat. If you're just keeping your snake under normal conditions in its cage, that isn't hibernating. They only hibernate/brumate if you force them to, like I do. Just check your temperatures and it should be fine. If it isn't eating, it's usually because the temperatures are too low.|`|sWvhJmmvaa	You should really thank about leting him go he well be much  happer...

That didnt look like it was banned from where i was sitting!<br>  <br>  They'd probably train them how to hunt but without them hunting anything, maybe hide dead game in the woods and make it a game for the dogs so they can still use their hunting instinct but not kill anything..  Same with people who have working dogs, but the dog hasnt got sheep to herd, so they let them out in an empty paddock to run around a million miles an hour playing catch for for hours on end. <br>  <br>  I really dont know! Just a thought of how they would still let their dogs do what they are bred to do.<br>  <br>  Oh well after reading what John said and reading what deadgame said, now it makes sense..
f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Each cat will need it's own litter box.  They may actually share the boxes, but whenever you have more than one cat, it's important to provide the option of another box.  Stainless steel feeding and water dishes are best.  Cats who eat from plastic bowls can sometimes develop feline acne.  They can share food and water dishes unless one gets sick in which case you'd need to separate them and they'd need their own dishes. Make sure to provide plenty of scratching posts and try different textures till you find the post they like to scratch.  Also, look into pet insurance or set up an emergency medical fund for the cats.  Every cat owner should have immediate access to at least $200 in case of emergency.  As far as toys, my cats get a kick out of playing in big cardboard boxes and paper bags.  You don't have to spend a fortune on cat toys.  Cats are just as content slapping and chasing the plastic ring off a milk jug as they are playing with a catnip mouse from the store.|`|NMcFF0Iwaa	I have 5 cats from 3 different families.  They share 2 litter boxes fine as long as I clean them daily.  They drink water from one bowl, also have a "pecking" order for eating from the same bowl.  2 from one litter eat together, when they are done, another who was waiting patiently comes to eat, & so on.  Never a problem since they formed their owned system of eating. (I feed canned food). <br>  1. Food.<br>  2. Litter box & litter & cleaning out scoop. Small wastebasket with bags to put poo in.<br>  3. scratching post if not declawed.<br>  4. catnip, if you have houseplants, I feed once a week, they leave my plants alone now. <br>  5. Slicker brush or comb.<br>  6. It depends on how willing you are to taking care of your pet, teeth brushing is recommeded by my vet once a week.  Pet brush & paste. <br>  I have a nail clipper, but find they scratch more when their nails are clipped. <br>  7. Toys.  I have one who loves the rings off of gallon milk jugs to carry & swat around.|`|nEuKwzcqaa	make sure they have plenty of room with a few places they can sit and hide a little if they are nervous but not places to get stuck in. they probably will share litter and food bowls. have one bowl each to start with though. catnip is useful and a few toys.|`|mzQhw8pLaa	You give them milk with bread in food!Be caring to them,play with them and give food to them!...........they should need their own litter box and food bowls because if they share there will be a fight between them!|`|d6kekKgeaa	they should share the food and water bowl just fine. one litter box will surfise, but two is better (they like options) get a good supply of litter, as you need to clean the box daily and change the litter 1-2 times a week, cat's are very fussy when it comes to their boxes and if they think it's dirty they will find somewhere else to go.... somewhere you don't want them to. get a scratching post of some sort so that they leave your furniture and rugs alone. a squirt bottole is good for teaching them not to do things, but you can only use it if their currently doing the bad thing or they'll never make the connection. good cat food, get a couple diffrent small bags at first till you figure out what kinds they like, then you can stick with the one they like. some wet food poutches too are good, but to much wet food will rot their teeth, but they do need wet food for the neutriants it has that dry food dose not. get several diffrent toys, but not a ton, wait to see what kinds they like first. if they are over 6 months old cat nip is a good treat.... for some reasion it dosn't really have any effect on cats younger then 6 months. if they have medium or long hair a brush to help with shedding is good, but if they are short haired it's not really a consern. cats like beds, but buying one isn't truly nessesary, just make a spot in a closet that's always open or somewhere else they can hide and they will probably adopt a corner you never even thought of. :) cats are pretty self relyent. (sorry can't spell) when you first get them home set them each in the litter box so they know where it is and show them the food and water bowls..... that's all i can think of right now....

I feed 2x a day, equal amounts. Check the feeding chart on the bag of food. When changing food it needs to be done gradually. Buy a good dog food. Neutro Natural Choice Lamb and rice has always been a favorite of my dogs. Be sure she is getting the correct size of bites for her size of dog. Little dogs need small bites.  If this continues you may want to check with the vet. Also, if she is one year old, she is no longer a puppy, so no puppy food.|`|AA11372747	Sounds like you are open feeding the dog (leaving the food down 24/7. do not do this.

Vomiting for a puppy is fairly normal (learning how to do things we often make mistakes) and if she seems to be gaining weight normally and doesn't seem too skinny she should be fine.|`|37b12a31d268859c0025a890cf07e867aa	Believe it or not your dog could be a little depressed. do you give your dog enough attention? Are you rich... if you are maybe your dog wants to have a normal lifestyle then again maybe it is the other way. Don't switch dog foods i would suggest if you do switch dog foods to give him/her pedigree because most dogs like it and if you are really into dogs like i am they give some of the money goes to a no kill animal shelter. don't give it really expensive food.|`|AA10889713	Maybe you are feeding too much.  How about asking your vet?|`|3db3397ee3156210aeddc867f6d7c49eaa	YES the vomiting could be due to the change in food.  If you are going to change foods, you should mix the two different types of food, adding the new one little by little at each feeding.  Then eventually your dog will be totally on the new food!|`|fba132793e61d3af694c1b3ce87f8408aa	have u ahd her to a vet yet? thing is unless you put youre puppy on a schedule she will be like kids eating when they want, changing the food isnt wize either , her being so young, keep her on a puppy food for a whiile shes still growing, i have a chocolate/ black lab and she was the same way...till we gave her a schedule...now shes fine, usually when dogs have a upset stomach they try to eat grass, if it keeps up take her to a vet...good luck

The term is used for both feral and pet varieties. The domestic dog has been one of the most widely kept working and companion animals in human history.<br>  <br>  The domestication of the gray wolf took place in a handful of events roughly 15,000 years ago in central Asia. The dog quickly became ubiquitous across culture in all parts of the world, and was extremely valuable to early human settlements. For instance, it is believed that the successful emigration across the Bering Strait may not have been possible without sled dogs.[3] As a result of the domestication process, the dog developed a sophisticated intelligence that includes unparalleled social cognition and a simple theory of mind that is important to their interaction with humans. These social skills have helped the dog to perform in myriad roles, such as hunting, herding, protection, and, more recently, assisting handicapped individuals. Currently, there are estimated to be 400 million dogs in the world.[4]<br>  <br>  Over the 15,000 year span that the dog had been domesticated, it diverged into only a handful of landraces, groups of similar animals whose morphology and behavior have been shaped by environmental factors and functional roles. Humans did not take an active, intentional role in this process until the last few hundred years. As the modern understanding of genetics developed, humans began to intentionally breed dogs for a wide range of specific traits. Through this process, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal.[5] For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a few inches in the Chihuahua to a few feet in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called "blue'") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark ("red" or "chocolate") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth.[6] It is common for most breeds to shed this coat, but non-shedding breeds are also popular.

They bark when they meet strangers, like to pee everywhere when they are not trained. A very loyal animal to human. Although they don't have soul, but you can see through their eyes, very sentimental. They don't go to heaven, it has a saying in the bible. Who knows that dog will go to hell when they died. Therefore, i like dogs...but i don't rear them. It is too sad to see them died when they grow old.

All the food, toys, bedding etc is fairly cheap to buy
ZDFw8o1Saa	Ah... a sad story.  <br>  <br>  This mare will know you're leaving.  Horses are smarter than we give them credit for.  If you are sad they may not know exactly what is wrong but they will know that you are upset.  Last year I had to give up my first ever horse I rode to a person I didn't even know.  I had ridden him for three years.  It killed me.  It seemed as though he was unreachable.  You have the luck of probably being able to see this horse again.  I won't go into the details because he was very old.<br>  <br>  Also for the last year I have been training a thoroughbred colt but his destiny lies at the track... in Kentucky... a good 7-8 hrs. from where I live.  Over the Summer he went down for about a month.  letting him go was just as hard as letting the aforementioned horse go.<br>  <br>  Here's what I do when I have to say good-bye.  I spend as much time as possible with them firstly.  Before they, or I, leave I go into their stall and groom them all the while talking to them and reassuring them that everything will be alright.  Then I hug them.  I hold their head in my arms and talk to them as you would something more important to you than your own life, because that is what a horse is.  I tell them how much I'm going to miss them and blow into their nose so they will always remember my scent if we are ever to meet again.  Then you just pet them.  find their itchy spot and scratch it even if it messes up the grooming you just did.  Stroke their face and ears and neck.  And before you leave give them one good kiss as you would give your own child.  <br>  <br>  That is how you say good-bye to a horse.  I may sound crazy but is you came all the way onto yahoo answers to ask how to say good-bye then you love that mare everybit as much as I love my little colt and my old gelding.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|0j6btyZDaa	Im so sorry for you, I remember when I got my first horse, two years later my father sold her behind my back. -.- <br>  <br>  Keep a pic of her and take it everywhere.

If you ever see her again in the next two years she will reckognise you. However you need to say goodbye for yourself.<br>  <br>  You just want to go in and stroke her, maybe give her a carrot or apple. Hug her and then say good bye. Have a photo of her, that may help, but really it's something you'll come to terms with over time. Maybe ask the owner to keep you updated?|`|NOAwpvcTaa	The first horse I leased go sold, so I know how you feel.

7G0IyCltaa	To put this in perspective, I'm going to explain a little bit about taxonomy.<br>  <br>  Both the ring-necked and plum-headed belong to the same genus, Psittacula.  These are more commonly called ring-necked parakeets, and include the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria), the moustached-parakeet (Psittacula alexandri) and both of your parrots, the Indian rose-ringed, or more commonly the Indian ring-necked parakeet (Psittacula kameri manillensis), and the plum-headed parakeet (Psittacula  cyanocephala).<br>  <br>  What all this means is that they are very closely related, and could even interbreed, and produce hybrid chicks that could mature and reproduce (side note: a horse and a donkey produce a mule, which can never reproduce).<br>  <br>  There are generalities about the different genera (e.g. Psittacula, Amazona), and species (e.g. ring-necked parakeet, African grey), but each parrot is also an individual.  Usually, for the parrots that you have it's the opposite.  Most people say that the plum-headeds don't make very good pets, yet the the ring-neckeds do.  I don't think there is that much difference in intelligence, since all parrots are highly intelligent, it's just their individual personalities.  I have six African greys, which is a species known for its talking ability; however, not all of mine are good talkers.  Some have a large vocabulary, but remain quiet most of the time.  Others have a limited vocabulary, but say things like, "Hello" over and over.<br>  <br>  Perhaps, you can observe your ring-necked and discover what it likes to do.  If it likes to just sit with you while you watch TV, do that with it.  Sometimes, we need to do what the bird likes, rather than what we like, which then, in turn makes everyone happy.|`|V865IftIaa	plm heads r best pet around..theycan talk also..the breed is like this only

They are soooo pretty!<br>  Most fish will survive if you miss feeding. I went on holiday for a week a while ago and came home to all my fish still breathing! You could also get the fish to live to your timetable by leaving the light on while you're at work so it would be fed in the "evening".

Can you imagine the stench? Now fish poop way more than mammals do! All that poop gives off ammonia, and in an uncycled and unfiltered tank that ammonia will burn the gill tissue of the fish and ultimately kill it.<br>  <br>  I would suggest a Betta BUT in at least a 5 gallon fully filtered and heated tank - Bettas are tropical fish after all - that has completed the nitrogen cycle before hand:<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitrogen_Cycle" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/The_Nitro...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishforums.net/index.php?showtopic=113861" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishforums.net/index.php?show...</a><br>  Skipping the cycle will lead to you having a sick/dead fish and annoyed girlfriend!|`|an1b4pXxaa	Kmart or Target has 20 liter tanks with a built in light and filter for around $50 plus small heaters for about $15, if you get that you could have a few male guppies.<br>  Guppies are cheap and colorful and reasonably tough.

Ive enjoyed my course, i didnt find the NC hard but as the corse get higher it gets harder, im actualy behind at the moment. (It may have something to do with hanning online all the time lol)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Also to Ashley W if you look at the bottom of the page after the answers but above the links for diffrent countries it will say what country the asker is in if they are not in the same counrty as you, if it doesnt say anything they are in the same country as you are.|`|uec7RIhbaa	i did an NC at college after a pretty rough year where i had dropped out of school and been pretty gross for a while.  i did the NC to get back into some sort of focus and work - as someone who had been riding for many years, owned a horse and helped out alot at my local yard the NC was a walk in the park difficulty wise - it was such a fun year.  i got loads of experience and great lessons and there was tonns of practical and any theory was so easy it was laughable - but that was just what i needed.  i made some great friends and had a wonderful year.  we did a four day week, 3 lessons a week and (i'm struggling to remember completely clearly) i think 2 or 3 practical sessions at the yard a week. <br>  <br>  Basically, although i thoroughly recommend the NC course for a year of getting used to a college type lifestyle and topping up any skills you already have it's really very easy if you have any experience at all.  it's really geared towards people who had next to no knowledge of horses etc but that doesn't detract from the fact it's a great intro to further college type equestrian courses and all lessons are of course invaluable.  It doesn't pile on the stress and the writing and work to be done out of college hours is minimal.  great fun but be prepared - if you go on to do the HNC it's much less fun - much MUCH molre essay writing and theoretical lectures and classes and much less "hands-on" with the horses.<br>  <br>  Again, although i do say the NC was awesome for a real progression in a horsey career and a more practical way forward is to take up a working pupil position at a yard willing to pay for the BHS exams etc - in the long run a few BHS stage exams will look way better on your CV than the NC courses.  many yards also run the NVQ courses which are similar but more hands-on than the H/NC courses.  good luck with whatever you decide.|`|UZBl63blaa	in england its not a recognised qualification,waste of time if your wanting to do your instructors exam.

wF52XMxAaa	Either make great pets.  The sun conure is obviously more colorful, may be a bit more playful and beakier, and can be louder.  The brown-headed will be quieter and probably talk better.<br>  <br>  Not that I'd recommend getting either before they're weaned.  You might consider putting down a deposit on one and letting the breeder finish weaning them.  You might be able to go visit before then.<br>  <br>  A bird that likes you is important, but baby birds are seldom very picky.  They develop more definite tastes as they get older.<br>  <br>  see:<br>  brown-headed - <a href="http://brownheadparrot.tripod.com/bhpet.html" rel="nofollow">http://brownheadparrot.tripod.com/bhpet....</a><br>  sun conure - <a href="http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww25eiv.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww25eiv...</a><br>  feeding - <a href="http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww7eii.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww7eii....</a> and<br>  <a href="http://www.parrothatch.com/handfeeding-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.parrothatch.com/handfeeding-1...</a>|`|v6coHbIeaa	The truth is the Sun will drive you nuts if you get it they are  very noise . you had better check before you buy and see if you can stand it when it starts hollering.  They are load.|`|FJHU9PbUaa	We have a sun conure & he is amazing. Extremely happy wiht him. Got him as soon as he was ready to go as a baby & he is now 4yrs old. He doesn not squawk at all, which is really a big plus. He loves to go outside on our shoulders & is very friendly & socialable. The only negative is he likes my husband & me & doesn;t like too many strangers coming & going. He has been known to walk under the table when we have company & bite a toe of our guests. They are really one or two person birds, very good withe their own people. When we come home he knows the sound of our car & is yelling for us as we come in the door, very happy to greet us home.  He loves his bird ball & will retreive it for hours.  He has a poop post, which looks like a small wooden perch wiht a mat under it & he knows to make poops when we put him on it, so he never poops on anyhting else except when in his cage. We put him on it, tell him to poop, & he will, just like that.  Not really knowledgeable on the brown parrots but wanted to give you an idea of what sun conures are like.
eo0Uv7Wsaa	I wish I could help but I have NO idea! that's so werd. Try calling a vet and explain what's going on, that you don't have enough money to take him in but ask what you can do and what's wrong in his opinion. Maybe look it up on the internet, too. I hope your baby gets better.
b8VRlStoaa	This all depends on what kind of relationship you want to have with your dog. He is depressed and lonely as the maid has left on break. But he will eventually stop crying if you leave him and adapt to the situation. That is something we had to go through crate training our dogs. However now that our dogs are older and know the crate is just a safe place to sleep when need be, we usually let them have the run of the house, day and night. They can sleep with us or sit on the couch, etc. Its a personal choice. I've said it before and I'll say it again, Dogs are our most faithful and loving friends when treated as such.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Sounds like your maid should be given the dog.  Go ahead and give it to her.  <br>  <br>  OR, take over complete responsibility over the dog, as it is your dog, so it your responsibility.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Why allow everyone to stay miserable, if you know how to fix it?<br>  <br>   I gather your maid usually sleeps somewhere near the dog - and now the dog is alone.  Let the dog be near your family, which by the way is where it should be anyway if it's truly your dog.  When the maid comes back, you can restore things back to the way they usually are, and everyone will be happy.<br>  <br>    Dogs are pack animals - put yourself in the dog's place - how would you feel sleeping all by yourself in one end of the house, while everyone else carried on with their lives in the other?  He/she just wants to be with you - sounds like an admirable trait to me.|`|7DpmGblgaa	i would just leave the dog to it - make sure it has a toy etc with it or a blanket -is there anythin different with it than when your maid was looking after it?<br>  the dog will be fine if left to it altho i know it can be difficult to sit listening to it crying.|`|sQOXjKFNaa	It sounds like your maid deserves a raise!  Try giving your pet more attention. He is alonely.
Um8osMNuaa	You should take him to the vets and get his vaccinations now, you can worm at the same time. <br>  Pups need worming every 2 weeks until 3 months old, then again every month until 6 months old, then every 3 months for life, this ensures that your dog will be continually protected from worms. <br>  Even if your pup doesn't have worms he still needs worming to protect him from them.|`|FdcWPp48aa	It is okay to worm and vaccinate at the same time.|`|Okzc9Hl6aa	It's generally okay to worm and vaccinate at the same time, but your pup really ought to be seeing a vet at last once for a 'new puppy' visit and to get a fecal done- no point in worming if your pup doesn't have worms (he probably does) and most of the over-the-counter wormers are less than effective.
dGvKF19kaa	If you can travel up to the Lehigh Valley (Allentown), there is a great place called Camp Bow Wow. They actually have video cameras setup so that you can check in on your dogs online. Just google it, and their site should come up.|`|eDySIDPQaa	`1---the best place to board is always first with your vet, there you know all the dogs around your dog has been vaccinated...and if your dog needs medical care, your vet is right there handy<br>  <br>  2---next would be Pets Mart, they board and also make sure the dogs are vaccinated before allowing them to be boarded<br>  <br>  3--if you use a regular kennel to board, you are risking a chance of the dog next to yours not being vaccinated or sick.....or your dog being put in with other dogs, it has happened.|`|FdcWPp48aa	Do they have a Petsmart Hotel in Philly?|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	Ask your veterinarian.<br>   Often the vet techs moonlight as pet sitters, and that would be the best place for your dog anyway.  Many dogs do not do well in a large facility with changing help and transient guests.
xKHeYmQJaa	Well, it's spring time.  Mare's come in heat right about now.  Mine went through her first one this year about 2 weeks ago.  My filly, Zuzu, is 4 this year.  She pees constantly, and paces her corral.  She's even started chasing her yearling away from her.  Watch her backside for change of color, like with Zuzu, she's pink and during heat, gets really pink, you should also notice some engorgement (swelling) of her female parts.  She could be losing weight like Zuzu because she's active when you aren't around.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	The fact that she is losing weight points away from this being related to her heat cycles.  You don't mention whether she is also excessively thirsty, or whether she is urinating more frequently or just producing a higher volume of urine, which could be significant.  The conditions that immediately come to mind are Cushings and kidney disease.  Is she drinking larger volumes of water than usual?  I would try to estimate how much weight she's lost over what period of time, and note any other symptoms that could be related, such as the quality of her hair coat and whether it is shedding normally.  If the weight loss can't be explained by anything obvious, and if she is excessively thirsty in addition to urinating a greater volume, I would call the vet to discuss it.  She may need blood work done to at least rule out conditions like Cushings or kidney disease.|`|RloOJ43haa	Could these be connected? Almost certainly.<br>  <br>  How do I fix them? Call the vet. Your horse is clearly sick. It could be kidney disease, Cushings, or any number of other things. She will probably need some fore of treatment.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I agree with the others as far as being in heat.  However I have not seen alot of mares lose so much weight as to notice , like you do.  It may be worth a blood test just to rule out a kidney problem or infection...  Just a thought.. (I worry too much about my horses, lol.. that is what I would do). But if she is eating and acting ok, she probably is ok. If her urine is light creamy and thick looking, that is from being in heat. If its got a kind of brighter than normal yellowish tint.. I would worry a little.|`|XB0UpJsLaa	she is probably in heat. ( and you may think she's loosing weight, but it might just be her winter coat shedding) but if she truly is loosing a lot of weight I would call your vet.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	a horse at our barn , did the same but he also could simply not get enough water to drink.  he would drink 5-6 buckets a day...15 h.h., not in work, no weight loss.<br>  it was his pituitary gland....|`|So7lXdBKaa	is she in season / heat|`|ZDFw8o1Saa	If your mare seems to be straining to urinate and only achieving a small amount of urine then I would definitely have the vet check her out.  She could have a number of things such as a urinary tract infection or kidney problems.  <br>  <br>  There is also the chance that she is in heat and you've just not noticed it before.  If she's being nasty to another mare it could be a sign that she's in season.  This is about the time that horses have their first heat cycle (assuming you live in the northern hemisphere) of the year.  A good test for this is to find out if she shows particular interest in male horses (whether they be stallions or geldings).  Where I work we have over thirty mares so we have a lot of horses in heat usually all at the same time.  <br>  Also if her urine is pale and thick looking she's in heat, if it's thin and a normal color or thick and a normal color, I'd have a vet check her out.<br>  <br>  Thoroughbredtrainin'girl|`|LizOP9s5aa	The two may not be connected at all.  Excessive urination maybe because she is in heat, however I would try to get a sample in a clean container and have your vet check it for signs of an infection just in case.<br>  When was the last time she had her teeth done?  It could be she is loosing weight because she is not able to properly chew her food. Or if she is older she may have lost some of her teeth making it harder to chew her food.<br>  How long has she been loosing weight?  If its been on going I would think that she either hasn't been getting enough food or she has worms.<br>  Are you sure that she is loosing weight and not muscle?  Most horses lose conditioning during the winter due to lack of work.  However if she seems to be "off" in other ways may want to have a neurological exam done on her.  EPM is a protozoa that horses get exposed to when grazing as a result of opossums and other animals in pastures or defecating in the hay.<br>  There could be several things going on with your horse.  Its best to have the horse checked by a knowlegable vet to determine what is going on.|`|bXTQAGnDaa	I had a really old gelding that had cushings. It's a tumor in the horse that causes them to not shed their winter hair coat, have a really thick and long winter coat, and as it progresses it affects the digestive system and organs  and all sorts of stuff. He urinated a LOT and he was incredibly skinny even though I fed him a LOT of food. A lot of times when a horse urinates so much it is a sign of problems with the intestines and kidneys. You might want to have a vet come and check her out. Good luck|`|HL2EZrfGaa	u answered my question. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=As3t6XmgGnJa2kzBsU3591YazKIX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304053123AAlRK2i">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  she lives in Virginia :-) Id appreciate your help. and Does she have access to salt? if she has to much salt she would drink a lot more than normal. This would cause her to urinate more than normal. If she urinates a gel substance that would also mean she has had to much salt.
oSXRSKFSaa	the tempreture is to low it should be about 90-100 degrees in his cage.because i have a beardie and he is about the same age and he is really active because he his tempreture is 90-100 degrees.he is probably trying to hibernate.they are used to hot weather because they live in the desert.so just try rasing the temp.<br>  <br>          i hope he feels better.|`|6cbce34f6d81808399f7101c75d8526baa	What are those temps again and are they maybe in C and not F? 100-110 F in basking spot. Sad that you saw a reptile vet that treated you and your dragon that way. I would report him if it were me. Was there anyone else there that would have helped you more. I am thinking I would call back to see and make an appointment. You know he could have some parasites too from the pet store. He could have picked them up from another dragon or even crickets so that needs to be checked. Lay off the carrots too as it is an occasional food not a staple but mustard, collard, turnip and dandelion greens are great especially topped with some butternut or acorn squash. I still think I would find a vet that cared. Please check those temps. If they are right I am sorry just I am not familiar with centigrade temp readings.|`|3IUMh4Igaa	Your problem is your heating. 30 C is only 86 F, 35 C is 95 F, so that is really not hot enough. While adult beardies like a basking temp of 95 F, a juvenile prefers to have a basking temp of around 110 F. 86 F is fine for the cool side. At night you are pushing it by letting it get down that far, but it is barely safe. <br>   Also, he may feel a bit intimidated in that cage. Younger reptile prefer to not be in an enclosure that is too large. They have trouble feeling secure.|`|uNfWYSfJaa	If the basking spot is over 95 F then its TO HIGH the best temp for a BD is 90-95 F that maybe why it looks sick try to turn down the heat Hope this helps.
AGZtUc4Xaa	Lie, you can do it to us, you can do it to your kid.|`|QaKGlNBNaa	Who stabbed the poor pup?!?!??!?!?!? If your husband did this, than I don't think you should own a dog (NO OFFENCE AT ALL!!!!) Just lie, and say that he was sick, or somthing.... Poor poochie!|`|T56FU1izaa	Okay, so seriously, you'd like us to believe that SOMEONE stabbed your son's dog multiple times, threw it off the roof of YOUR house and it wasn't you?  Your husband thinks it was you, your kids think it was you, but it wasn't you.  Your husband thinks his wife is capable of stabbing a dog numerous times and pushing it off of a roof but it wasn't you.  Hmmmm.<br>  <br>  But going with that, the number one thing you need to do is change your whole demeanor so that you can make it so your husband doesn't believe you would be capable of such a horrendous crime.  Secondly, you need to seek out other suspects for this crime.  Who had access to your house?  Your dog?  I'm guessing a limited number of people have access to your home to throw a dog off the roof.  And whoever did this needs serious professional help right away!  Thirdly, you need to sit down with your four year old, who probably doesn't understand anyway, and just tell him his beloved dog has gone to heaven.  Don't go any further into the explanation, he doesn't need or have the attention span for details.<br>  <br>  And you don't EVER want him to think it was his fault.  No way, no how.  And if he needs some sort of counseling to get over this, get it for him right away.|`|th45yP4Xaa	Why would you want to convince your son that he killed the dog?
AA11709234	Pigs are VERY hard to give anesthetic to.  Sometimes it has to be done though.  They are prone to all kinds of anesthitic problems.  And they have problems that often need anesthitic like having the teeth/tusks filed.  Many pigs are NOT real helpful when you are trying to do something with them either!!!!|`|5657dabb07790f85827e1c0e8e02e5c0aa	I have an 11-year-old pot-bellied pig --- and she has been successfully anesthetized several times.  But ... I have learned over the years to be very careful about what vet I use.  Most vets aren't familiar with pot-bellied pigs -- and, once I find out they don't know much about pigs, even if they are willing to work on her, I go elsewhere.  (I have found out that, generally speaking, I know more about pot-bellied pigs than most vets do.)<br>  <br>  I take my pig to the vet every 6 months to have her hooves trimmed.  She has to be put to sleep -- because otherwise she throws a big hissy fit -- but I always insist that they put her to sleep with "gas" rather than with an injection.  They just put a mask over her snout long enough for her to flop over -- only about 30 seconds -- then they trim her hooves and she wakes up in about 5-10 minutes.  Gas is much less invasive on a pig's system than an injection.<br>  <br>  Several years ago, my pig had a serious internal disorder (bleeding vaginally from an unknown source) -- and I took her to the Veterinary School of Medicine in College Station, Texas.  Obviously, they had to put her to sleep "big-time" (rather than just with a whiff of gas) -- but they were experts and knew what they were doing.  She turned out fine.<br>  <br>  But -- bottom-line -- to answer your question, pigs will definitely tolerate anesthesia -- but a vet sure has to know what he-or-she is doing -- because it's totally different from putting dogs and cats to sleep.|`|7bdbac74cccef33e0925f1cf925a9fd7aa	hiya yeh i think its safe but to be on the safe side please check with the sspca ( Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals ) if you live in scotland or the rspca ( Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) if u live in england & wales if you need the address of your local sspca or rspac u can contact your local police office or look up your locla office of the sspca or rspca at www.yell.com and they will also give u door to door directions|`|c2616fa2cef1a90c56e4b404d0da1f68aa	Pig anaesthesia is problematic as they tend to overheat and develop Malignant Hyperthermia.  They are also susceptible to a lot of other anaesthetic problems, and so losing them is always a real risk.  Giving an anaesthetic is sometimes required but it is risky.
0d0706a200db4391c1ff8a757730735faa	Make Your Own Fly Trap<br>  <br>  A bit of Fly psychology. When a fly takes flight it always takes off up and toward the sun. <br>  That is why this thing works!!!<br>  <br>  Materials Needed: <br>  One 5 gallon bucket <br>  Screen, on old screen off a door will do <br>  Glue, something the consistency of caulking <br>  Bailing wire or twine <br>  3 lb coffee can <br>  Bait <br>  Equipment: <br>  Knife to cut the bucket <br>  Scissors <br>     <br>  Using your knife or box cutter, cut windows out of the side of your bucket all the way around. Flies will always move toward the sunlight so you want a nice open view.  <br>  Next, cut a hole in the bottom of the bucket.   <br>  Make a cone out of your screening. Leave a small opening in the top about the size of your little finger. This is where the files will enter the trap...BUT..they will NOT try to leave the same way. Place the cone in the hole in the bottom of the bucket and trim excess leaving enough screen so that you can clip and fold it back and glue it in place on the bottom of the bucket.   <br>  Now that you have your cone in place cut a strip of screen that will wrap around the inside of the bucket. Glue this in place. Cut a square or circle to use as a lid. Place this on with bailing twine or wire. You will want to be able to take the lid off and empty your bucket so that you can use it again next year.   <br>   Bait it!<br>  A good fly attractant is like an old sourdough start. Once you get it going, keep feeding it. Being a horse person I hang my fly traps on the corral fence and put a 3lb coffee can on the ground under the cone. The files come to the bait and when they take off they fly "up" into the cone and walk on up into the trap. <br>  <br>  At the beginning of the season I start out with a commercial attractant. There are several on the market. I add a little fresh dog poop from time to time. I also throw in some decaying vegetable cutting from the garden. What ever smells is the key. Be sure and keep water in your bait can. You don't want to let it dry out. <br>  <br>  Placement of your fly trap is important also. If it is not working well where you hang it, move it five feet. Don't ask me why this makes a difference. I know one year it works on this part of the fence and next year it wants a new spot.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are a dog person you may want to take a little extra time and screw three or four legs on to the bottom of your bucket. That way just find the freshest poop in the morning, set it down and before you go to work you will have captured several hundred files.|`|68e3866646abc4edcfe63dcfee1c4fa5aa	Well, if you mean a device to catch flies, you could go to your local tack or feed store, and they should have a few different traps that you can use.|`|85c0eae745de9e7a55980c67950b3cc2aa	you tack a gallon milk jug and cut the top off of it then place the top upside down in the bottum of the contaner. put water in and hang up. and just drill a hole in the top about the size of a fly. and this is not amde for horses flys or the big slow flys!

Has it been more than three days? You will usually see results in that time. If it isn't better in three days return to the vet and ask if there is something else going on. Was the ear swollen like with pus? Or like with a broken blood vessel and has filled up with blood? If it is from pus the antibiotics will take care of it. If it has blood then the vet needs to sedate it and drain it.

Most shampoos dry out a dog's skin, but this does the opposite.<br>  <br>  For diet, switch to a higher protein premium food, such as Canidae or Raw Instinct (made by Nature's Variety).  Both diets have high protein, none of the bad stuff (wheat, corn, soy) that cause skin problems, and both are LOADED with omega fatty acids, which are awesome for a dog's skin & coat.<br>  <br>  Check out their websites below, and see for yourself.

My family and I have also raised Pitbulls for sometime now. My Pyr. has all kinds of skin issues as well. If your dogs skin is dry try  giving her an oatmeal bath. Do not use everyday products you use on a human it further dries the skin out as conditioners that block the pores. You can try going to target or walmart and picking up a lotion however with Vitamin E or your other solution is to go to a farm store or petsmart and pick up what they call Pulvex Veterinary Ointment which is used to treat dry cracked skin in animals and a slew of other things. Start taking things slowly out of her diet to determine if its a food allergy, no human food. Every now and then a couple of eggs are good it promotes healthy skin and coat as well as tsp of bacon grease, or vegetable oil. You can also take you dog out on a lease to see if maybe it is the area she is using the restroom in that has some plant that is bothering her and causing the itching. I would also pick up some vitamin E caps from the petstore as well. Most if not all this stuff can be found at walmart. I tried taking my dogs to vets and found them only interested in charging me a hand and leg in the past, therefore I then decided to become a vet myself. So now im a vet student. Try these solutions mainly the pulvex or some aveeno dry skin non-methol or shea butter or cocco butter and they will most likely work.|`|ebc3c42d3b7d07804e7d88bfe6e7fd65aa	What we used to do, we used to put a tablespoon or so of vegetable oil in my dogs' food, it helped.

2baaa1694a5c1bc2803e566c6e0ff0c4aa	Catnip will help. Also, don't pursue her to try and coax her into being affectionate. Set aside a good chunk of time- an afternoon or something- and pick a good book or some other quiet activity. Sit somewhere where she spends a lot of time, and just ignore her. Being quiet and still, and not paying any attention to her will reassure her that you aren't chasing her to hurt her, and if you keep a little catnip toy or a treat next to you, she will eventually get curious and come up to see what it is of her own accord. even when she does, keep ignoring her, unless she initiates an interaction with you. hopefully, repeating this exercise a few times will encourage her to feel comfortable around you again.|`|6b7352123726385d404e7ac5813a4cd0aa	Is your cat a medium or longhair? Cats have a lot of pride and in my experience in raising cats for 30 years, females that have medium or longhair tend to be a bit more jumpy after being spayed. I have tried to figure it out and the best I can come up with is that they are embarrassed about the shaved spot. I coaxed Precious into letting me pet her (with catnip) and she did fine until I looked at her belly then she ran. Anytime she laid down, she would try to hide the shaved area. She did this very  until the hair grew back fully. Then she was fine again, just took her time for her pride to heal. lol Catnip might help. Sprinkle some on a towel then lay it in the floor. Within minutes your cat will be going crazy rubbing herself down on that towel. =)|`|a3e4db7bc0aa18e66a39e44371d7a206aa	Might want to think about a dog or a new cat.

Also, how long ago has it been since she was fixed? If it hasn't been too long (less than a month or so) she could be in some pain (or experiancing residual pain) You can always get toys that have catnip in them and just try to get her play with it (of course for some reason all cats love catnip, kind of like alcohol to us adults, makes us a little giddy sometimes :) ) You can also just pet her (don't just tap her head, it gets a little annoying sometimes) and don't forget the butt elevator (scratch the area of the back closest to the tail and watch the butt go up and down, cats love it!) Also talk reassuring to her, animals like to be talked to (they may not be able to talk back to you but they do listen) Just tell her, in your most reasuring voice, that she'll be ok, all the while gently petting her and rubbing her neck and scratching her chin. Just give her time.

The action you are describing is called the Flehmen Response, and is very common.<br>  <br>  In order to help them recognize these smells most efficiently they posess something called the vomeronasal organ (also called Jaconbson's organ).  This is basically a nerve center that helps send smell input to their brain, and is quite sensitive to various odors and other stimuli (researchers have suggested cats can also sense pheromones and even pressure changesin the air from weather changes with this organ).<br>  <br>  This organ is often located within small ducts/holes at the roof of the mouth, just behind the front teeth. The organ and ducts then connect with the nasal cavity. Thus, opening his mouth slightly enables the Jacobson's Organ to open up the ducts connecting to the nasal cavity.<br>  <br>  Check out these links for more info:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flehming</a><br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|686bab4ee4e8bd230ddd34b2163976f0aa	Well I was going to answer this but lunarkry answered this absolutely correct.|`|f9ff35302d5612c6365b273bf5ad09c3aa	well......shoes/sock (particularly leather shoes) emit a scent similar to feline sex pherinomes which is why cats will also lay/roll/rub on the shoes after smelling. (I actually read about this) After smelling sex pherinomes, many animals (especially males) will pull their lips back, exposing their gums while sticking their necks out.  I've personally seen cats, dogs, cattle (bulls), goats, deer, and elk do the same thing.  I agree, it is pretty funny and I'm glad the male of my species doesn't do the same thing.|`|6a15e3808f08ae0fa4d60379ad941b21aa	When they do that they are actually able to smell it better, at least that is what I've been told.

Animals don't really respond to odors we consider foul with the same digust that we do- after all, most dogs roll in things we wouldn't go near with rubber gloves, and most animals despise the smell of citronella, which we burn as candles.  So it's not likely he thinks the stuff stinks, he just is investigating it.

Si te das cuenta hay temporadas cuando el perro anda muy hiperactivo, que no lo puedes mantener quieto, es entonces cuando trae ese nivel de hormonas alto y con el cansancio del ejercicio se relaja. Con 8 anios de edad tu perro ya es un adulto, ya ha vivido aproximadamente la mitad, seria como un humano de aproximadamente 37 anios !!! y sin sexo !!! ,cruzalo, no seas cruel. Saludos.|`|iWs2i8otaa	en primera no creo le haga da?o y para que no te queden mal ve a una veterinaria si no te importaria tendras que pagar dinero para que te la cruzen y tambien es mas mejor en la veterinaria ya que con las personas ponte en sus zapatos al principio lindos luego donde los botan
JxS3QhdIaa	you mentioned that you washed out the fish tank you can only clean this with water you cannot use any type of cleaner or this will kill your fish if you already knew this then there are other reason also, do you do water changes?? i have a 30 gallon and i do water changes every week but you can do them every 2 weeks this will keep the water crystal clear and healthy for the fish!!!also have you checked the chemicals in the water??if you dont do water changes all the excess food ,poop and pee breaks down and rises the ammonia in the water which will kill the fish... if the pH is high it will put stress on the fish and kill them!you can get a tester for all that needs to be tested in your tank at walmart or your local pet store, i got mine at petsmart and it cost like 24$ and it will test everything!!when i got my tank like 5 years ago i didn't know any of this and my fish died off the same way, i never did water changes or checked the ammonia levels or anything ...now i have a perfect tank everything is where it needs to be and Ive learned alot about my tank and fish environments. i havent had a fish die since then! i hope this helps and if you need anymore information then email me its in my profile!!!!!|`|T3CV4E9caa	Are you giving the tank environment time to develop? What kind of filteration and airation are you running? Is the temperature right? Generally when you start a tank and get new fish, you should have the tank running for at least a week with all the filtration systems and everything. I actually had the same problem with my 40 gallon tank. I would buy bala sharks and they kept dying on me within a few days. I then got some hardy tough african peacock cichlids and they were fine. In fact later on they kept breeding like rabbits. I know its weird and it doesn't make much sense. I would actually try some cichlids. They are pretty tough. You could also take a sample of water to Petsmart and they will test and tell you what's wrong with it, all for free.|`|tLRkUXpZaa	You could have some metals in your tank like copper. Or it could be like amonia or p.H. or something.|`|f3e836dc199d638d33ddb139df8afaedaa	Are you trying to say 3 goldfish?
