I know this has been asked about a few times-- and I've read some of them to figure it out but these two are different from the other ones I looked at on here,   X+Y=5   X-Y=3   The teacher said something about lining them up to add and so I tried they already looked lined up so I just added.   Y=8   I know that's wrong, it has to be. But we never do problems with only uknown variables so I had no clue on that one.      2.)

I graduated from American high school and also have an Internationale Baccalaureate Diploma (35 points...not great, but above the international average by 1 point :D).   Anyway, I recently moved to the UK, but it doesn't seem like I will be able to afford uni at the moment...although things my change by May, who knows :D. I actually missed the deadline for Oxford/Cambridge because I wasn't aware that they had a different one...   So, let's say I take more time off before going to university (I took one year off for the big move to a new country). Is there anything I can do from here to this September, or from here to next September that will make my chances of getting in either of these two universities better, and something that would help me afford it.   Thank You :D   My current decision is History, but I might go with Archaeology, or even something further from that, Literature. I'm equally interested in all.

I have worked at this place (childcare centre) for 2 years and I have the 3-4 year olds (some are 2, these are the children who go to school in 2011)      I am concerned about one boy in the group. Here is the info...      - 2 years, 8 months   - Lack on attention span   - Seems to like music activities and cars   - Throws toys and thinks its funny   - Comes from an Arabic background, apparently there is minimal speech in Arabic, as well as English.   - Baby talks, e.g beep beep, baba, mama. These are pretty much the only words we have heard from him in the time he has been here (6 months)   - Likes to bottom shuffle   - Seems to be off with the fairies eg. You say something to him and its 'eh?'      Don't get me wrong, he is a beautiful boy but I'm concerned. My children in my group are at different levels, but not like this.      We had his sister at the centre last year and while her attention span was short, she seemed to be developmentally fine. But I'm concerned about him. I am going to talk to my supervisor about it. But what are your thoughts on this?
20090225032142AAJIte5	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Comment proof reading please !! 10 points :)?	I just want comment about Clooney's trip to Darfur and what his mission all about.   Here we are not getting a lesson out of Iraq war and Mr. Clooney wants and promoting for another war. If he is really looking for peace he should think of having that money and use it to build up Darfur and let both parties set together and come up with a peace plan that fits all parties’ requirements and over all benefits the Sudanese people.    If today US and big nations such as France and UK ...etc send troops to Sudan to fight and so, we just creating another war just like the one in Iraq, in the end all the troops will pull out leaving a country that lives in terror and fear .   78% of Sudan's people agree with the President Omar Al-basheer, 20% of Sudan's people will be the Darfur state that don't agree with the president, and the 2% who just lives in and out of Sudan but don't care about what's going on.   So Mr. Clooney would rather vote for war against Sudan just to save 20% of Sudan and kill 78%, what peace idea he is talking about!!?    If the war was the only option then how much money we talking about here that going to be spent in such a war.!! 15% of that money could save Darfur and build it and bring jobs to Darfur’s people and everybody lives happy, and still there is left over.   If Mr. Clooney really concern about Sudan's problems then let us go back and see that South and North of Sudan just ended war that lasted for over 20 years with simple peace talk. Here we can take a good lesson for us to look at it and apply it on Darfur's problem too.   I hope Mr. Clooney look at Sudan from an over view over all look instead of looking from a very narrow view , Sudan is a diverse nation in everything you could think of , languages , cultures , religions , race and nationalities .I just want say to Mr. Clooney it's very hard in very short period of time to come from first world country and living a luxury lifestyle of Hollywood all the way the to the most poorest country on face of this earth that rank one of the lowest 3rd world countries and to be more exact to an area that tribes have conflicts and judge them on how it should be done as far as what he call it "peace" which is in the reality consider door a "war" ,without knowing their history , how they think , what is their cultures is all about or even knowing their languages . It’s very hard. The only way out of this problem is to set down and talk. All it takes is chairs, a round table and thinking people that starves for peace.

20090225051653AAfa3jd	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Why don't people know the difference between hate and dislike?	More people tend to say that they hate something rather than just dislike it or bad qualities something has instead of just hate the whole thing. Would it be better if people didn't use the word hate? More people use it because they know it's a hurtful word. Do you try to be nice and if so what word would you use?

20090225045823AAo301O	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	I'm a social pariah at school :(?	Ever since I started second grade, I've been homeschooled, along with my older sister and younger sister.  Before I started my freshman year, however, my parents enrolled my older sister, younger sister and I into a small, Catholic school that's located in a very small, exclusive town that's thirty minutes away.  This town is infamous for being very exclusive, but nonetheless, my parents thought it would be a good idea to send my sisters and I there.  Almost all the kids have been going to this Catholic school their entires lives, so they're all very close, plus, they're all Catholic; I'm not; my sisters and I are pretty much the only Protestants in this school.   When I first started going there, I was extremely nervous, but I was nice and I tried to be outgoing.  Almost no one bothered to introduce themselves or get to know me, except one girl, who I'll call Katie (names have been changed); she was nice to me at first, but after a couple of weeks, she began to ignore me.  For the entire months of September and October, no one talked to me unless they wanted a piece of gum or they needed me to help them cheat; I did, which I regret now.   Eventually, I became "kinda-sorta" friends with the only other "outcast" in our class, who I'll call "Hannah".  Hannah used to be best friends with Katie, but now, her few friends are in the "other" freshman class.  In our school, there is the Geometry freshman class and the Algebra freshman class, and we only see each other during lunch.  Hannah is friends with the same guy I'm friends with, who I'll name Jonathan.  A lot of guys consider Jonathan gay, but he's really nice and I know he's not.  Jonathan is pretty much the only person who bothers to talk with me.  Hannah tolerates me, and only talks to me when she feels like it.    Jonathan and Hannah are friends with a girl I'll call "Lindsey".  Lindsey is a bit of a social outcast, considered fairly weird, and is part of the geometry class; however, she was nice to me when I first came to school, but now she hates me.  All she ever does is put me down during lunch, albeit in such a way that it doesn't seem mean, but I really know it is.  Hannah does the same to me to during lunch.   What I'm asking is, how do I deal with these people?  Why won't these kids accept me and like me?  People avoid sitting next to me at lunch, but when they have to, they sigh and roll their eyes.  What am I doing wrong?  What can I do right to make friends with them?  I dread school every day, and always make sure I have homework to do during classes so that when we have a free period, I won't be the only person with no one to talk to.  I wouldn't call myself depressed, but every other day I come home crying.  I've begged with my parents to send me to the public school in my own town, but they won't until my older sister finishes high school there, and her senior year is next year.  Any help you can offer?

20090225043957AA7qkRK	Education & Reference;Preschool	Do you wish you could go back to Kindergarten?	Don't get me wrong, it's great to get more mature and take more opputunities and grow and get noticed and stuff, but do you ever wish you could go back? Like, Kindergarten, playing Hopscotch or Duck-Duck-Goose? I know it may sound kind of stupid, but, like, you didn't have to worry about anything at all. I don't think you ever had to worry about combing your hair, because nobody would care whether you did or not, anyway. Dancing to The Wiggles, making a huge deal out of being able to count to 20, and spelling words wrong and people thinking it's cute? Lots of adults talking, and you don't understand hardly a word they're saying, and holding hands with everyone in the class. Nobody hated anybody. And, if they did, they didn't know what they were talking about, and they'd just make up like the best of friends before the next day even arrived. Sing, dance, out of tune, out of steps, routine, eat  messily and nobody would care. Don't you wish you could ever go back? Just think about it. Did you ever have to worry about relationships, commitments, career paths, financial descisions, and being rejected? Well, for one,, I don't remember any of that back then. Just think about it, it was so much easier back then. Don't you agree?

(biology)?	we have to draw a pedigree out of this song..    this is soo weird can someone please help me?      Clearly draw a pedigree of this man’s family.   Must be easy to see the relationships.          Many, many years ago when I was just twenty-three,      I was married to a widow, she was pretty as could be.      This widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair of red      And my father fell in Love with her. Soon they too were wed.             This made my dad my son-in-law--changed my very life!      My daughter was my mother because she was my father's wife!      To complicate the matter even though it brought me joy,      I soon became the father of a bouncing baby boy.             My little baby he then became a brother-in-law to Dad.      Well, that made him my uncle--made me very sad!      Because if he was my uncle then he also was a brother      To the widow's grown-up daughter, who, of course, was my stepmother.             CHORUS             My father's wife then had a son who kept them on the run.      And, of course, he became my grandchild because he was my daughter's son.      My wife is now my mother's mother and this makes me blue      Because although she is my wife, she's my grandmother too!             CHORUS             Now if my wife is my grandmother, well, then I am her grandchild,      And every time that I think about this, it nearly drives me wild!      Because now I have become the strangest case that you ever saw      As husband of my grandmother, I’m  my own grandpa!         CHORUS:   I'm my own grandpa! I'm my own grandpa!      It sounds funny, I know, but it really is so!      Oh, I'm my own grandpa!

I already posted this question but I didn't really get the answer I was looking for =[         I'm currently a freshman, I know I already made a lot of mistakes this year but I have the rest of High School to make up for it. Anyways, my GPA so far this year is a 3.9, not taking honors class but I'm taking a higher level math. I haven't done any extracurricular activities, or partake in a group. I am planning on doing community service, next month and for the rest of the school year. Next year, I will be doing 3 honors classes (IB Chemistry, Pre-IB English, Pre-IB Algebra2). My question is, even though i didn't do any extra curricular or community service, will I still have a chance?      I know i still haven't taken any of the standardized test, but I plan on succeeding in those next year, as well as doing my best on my grades and participating more on extracurricular activities and groups next year.      The only motivation I had on doing well academically well this year was UC Berkeley, and it isn't until recently, that I found out how important this is to me.      As I stated before, will it be possible for me to get into UC Berkeley even if i hadn't done any extra curricular activities? (I will do them next year and I'm planning to do something in the summer)      Also does UC schools count an IB diploma?

20090225053549AApMnid	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Repeating kindergarten with no academic issues?	At this moment in time, and for the next year or two, I have VERY few schooling options for my son (it' a question of where I live and not really negotiable for now). He started school early, has just turned 5, and is in kindergarten (having been in preschool since age 2). He likes doing schoolwork, is especially interested in math, reads fairly well  but not yet independently (makes mistakes). We use 3 languages, and he is highly articulate in all 3, and is attempting to learn a 4th (local language where we live) pretty much on his own, as well as getting along in basic Spanish (which he gets at school). At home, he asks for math and writing work ("homework") although, at this level, the school does not yet hand out any, so I give him pages off store-bought workbooks or things I print off websites. He will sometimes invert the direction of a letter or number, but adds and subtracts very well, is beginning to understand multiplication, and generally likes learning. At school, however, he is doing less and less. He will sit in front of a simple assignment, such as writing out his full name, poke holes in the paper, draw lines without actually finishing the work, etc. His coloring varies from careful and sensible (in the lines, right colors) to a black scribble.   His teacher is intent on holding him back (repeating kindergarten), stating that he is "immature". He's preoccupied (as are many kids his age) with who is or isn't his friend, and his teacher tells me some of the kids reject him because they perceive him as a baby. is the youngest in the class, but his friends tend to be older (mostly aged 6-9). I have asked him about what is going on at school, and his answer so far is that he is very frustrated (his own words). When I ask why, the answers vary, but involve being distracted by friends and being harassed by a couple of other boys. He also says that he knows how to write his name and his letters, so why can't he do it differently every time  - which he sometimes does, varying the inclination of the letters or adding curlicues. He also says he'd like more work with numbers.   I see no action on the part of the teacher to address any of this, beyond saying that she hasn't seen him do the work at school so it fails to be her problem. The school does not have a counselor or anyone who could really solve the problem, and switching schools is not an option in any way. I am looking through home schooling possibilities, but it will pose huge problems in many ways. I firmly believe that holding him back will be disastrous, as he is already showing clear signs of boredom.  Does anyone have any suggestions as to how to deal with this? I really want to avoid the most drastic solution, which is moving out of the country so I can enroll him in another school.

20090225054635AArdOVH	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Will I lose all my friends on leaving university?	I've been really stressed and worried lately, to the point where I can't sleep, because I'm due to graduate in a year and still haven't established a steady group of friends at university. I'm studying abroad from home and plan to stay here, but I've lost touch with nearly all my old friends from home and I don't have much family either. I'm really concerned that when I leave uni my friends will all leave and go their separate ways and I'll be left on my own. I find it hard enough at the minute, because people are flighty and unreliable and I'm worried that I spend too much time with my boyfriend and that pisses off my mates. I try my best to make time for everyone but it's hard to juggle that and get work done.       My bf is great and I love spending time with him, but I keep getting this niggling feeling that if we (god forbid) broke up, would I be on my own? Do I try my best to make time for my girlfriends but they're ALWAYS going out and I can't keep up with it. I'm a member of lots of societies, and they're good, but I haven't really made any proper friends at them, plus I'm often too tired to go to socials.      Can anyone help/advise? Is it normal to leave uni and lose your friends? I'm so afraid...

I'm the third generation to go to this particular school, my mom and grandfather both went. Ever since I was little I felt I had to as well. The thing is, I'm not happy here. It's a very large school and I have anxiety being around large groups of people. I don't even really know why I'm here, I don't particularly see my future coming from any of the majors here. What I really want to do is be a nurse and the community college in my town has small classes sizes and an excellent nursing program to become an RN. This University is so expensive, I already have thousands of dollars in loans and grants here. I've already dropped to 12 hours this semester but I want to drop more. I don't know if I can without it affecting my aide though. Should I continue at a University just so I can get a Bachelors or go to the community college and get an Associates to do something I really would love?

20090225063815AAw40l5	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Can you check my grammar please?	I feel that college is a necessity. It is a wonderful way to advance your career opportunities. College provides a wealth of knowledge. I believe being in college you become more responsible. It brings about more independence and it helps you mature in ways you never thought possible. However, college is becoming more and more expensive. There are grants, loans, and scholarships but tuition should still be lowered. College really pays off in the end. It takes a while to feel as if you have accomplished anything because there are so many classes unrelated to your major but staying focused you will see that there is a bigger picture. College is very challenging and demanding you have to stay focus and more importantly you have to be very optimistic otherwise you will give up.       Any suggestions please give them thank you so much   LoveYa

20090203150427AAvQNSy	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	How hard is it to get into LSE for an American?	I'm a junior in high school, so it's about that time. I live in New York and I would LOVE to study abroad.     I definitely want to rise into politics sometime in my life. Prior to that though, I want to either be a high school or a professor of history, a lawyer, a psychologist or work for the gov't (CIA, FBI etc.).     In high school, I've already taken (and aced) a college level world history class, half a year of psychology and a full year of business/personal law classes. I'm currently taking a college level American history class (which I had a 95 [out of 100] in last quarter) and next year I plan on taking college level European history, college level economics and college level participation in gov't.    Right now, I'm thinking about colleges including SUNY Buffalo, SUNY Binghamton, George Mason, Boston College and Rutgers, but my dream would be to study abroad for example at LSE.     How hard would it be for an American to do this?
