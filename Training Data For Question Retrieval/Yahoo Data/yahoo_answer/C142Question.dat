I have abdominal cramping/sharp pains atleast once a day for the past 3 days now.   I have a eye floaters, which i read could be hormones in pregnancy? Anyone else hear that or experience that?   For the past week i've also been noticing that my underarm hair as been growing faster, i have to shave every day, and no matter how much i scrub with soap and use deoderant half way through the day I feel like a smell, but no one else seems to think i do.. my boyfriend has not said anything,even when we lay together.. and he would...      My breasts feel full, but i don't know if that is one of my symptoms. I took a preg test at PPH 2 weeks ago came back neg. But that could have bee wrong right? Like it was too early.      anyone have these symptoms during early pregnancy.. i guess I could be 4 weeks to 6 weeks.
20090219124756AAFBcLW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possible pregnancy??	Alright ladies. My last period was Jan 18th (i have been having a regular 27/28 day cycle for a few months now). I ovulated the 3rd of Feb. But the last time my husband and I "made love" was the 1st. we have been ttc for about a year now. I had slight off/on cramps, Slight sore breast from ovulation until the day I missed my period (Feb 15th). So im about 4 days late and i dont feel ANY pregnancy or period symptoms and my cervical mucus is bone dry. once in a while I will get very tiny white clumps but ONLY when i look with a mirrior (SO sorry for the tmi.) could that be a yeast infection (no itch with a SLIGHT odor, nothing to worry about though). So I just need advice becuase I dont want to test until March 1st, to give my period time to come, im just SO nerves about this.

I have plotted Pregnancy Inquiry Count (PIC) vs. time since the 500,000 data point. Since then, I've collected 5 data points. I have used a regression forecast putting the 1,000,000th inquiry between June 25 and 27, 2009. The coefficient of determination is a whopping 99%, so this is serious business!! Whoda thought boinkin' rates would follow such consistency? There are minor fluctuations; however, the linearity of the regression is astonding!

I came on my period in january, but this month i've just had brownish light bleeding. i also usto suffer with anorexia so cannot stop looking at my tummy worring about it. i took a pregnany test about 4/5 days after new year and it came up as not pregnant, but that didnt stop me from worring. could i still be pregant. any answer will help, please!

20090219130505AAYhDan	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the chances of me being in labor?	(Thought I'd give this question one more shot....I sent it during the late hours before.)      This may be a little long but please help me to understand. I am pregnant with #3. My first two pregnancies were picture perfect and both of them were induced.      This one has been picture perfect until a sudden onset of braxton hicks. At 31 weeks, when I went in I was 80% effaced but my cervix was closed.      I was given the test to at that point to see if I was in pre-term labor and it came back negative.      Later that week, I lost the infamous plug and was put on complete bed rest. Things calmed down some for a while but have started up again.      I am now 33.4 weeks pregnant and for the past three days have anywhere from 4 -10 BH per hour from 1 - 3 hours in a row and then it just stops. Last night they lasted throughout the night and into the morning before slowing down.      The intensity does not change...it does not hurt and I do not feel any different than I have from the beginning of this process.      My doc. said to continue the bed rest and he will see me in two days rather than waiting until next week.      I'm just curious if one can actually be in labor without the intensity changing?...or what my chances are at this point for going into pre-term labor. (I have no warning signs and do not participate in any of the things that would cause it....so if it happened, I'd be one of those cases where they don't know the reasons.)      I hope this makes sense....I'm just curious...not stressed but want to stay informed.      Thanks for your help.      Additional Details   Amazingly, I only felt one contraction between my first two pregnancies before the glorious epidural. With both of them, I didn't receive the epidural until reaching 4 cm....that's why it makes me a little nervous not knowing whether they are just BH or other....so if you have the "menstrual cramps feeling" but it last for 5 minutes or so and then disappears....is that considered a contraction?
20090219134311AA9WIbN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Insomnia after delivery?	With my last 2 babies I have had a horrible time with insomnia for about 2 weeks after they are born. It is miserable to me because it just aggravates my already crazy hormones. I have pretty much just accepted that I will have to deal with this again (I am 39 weeks pregnant). I am wondering who else has gone through this, and what you do to cope. I am thinking I will rent some really great movies and read entertaining books.
20090219132957AAWakFA	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Afraid of Needles!!  How can I cope?	OK - I suffer from trypanophobia which is an irrational fear of needles (doctors are included in the phobia too) and I will either cry, jump up off the table or try to leave the room when someone approaches me with a needle.      Simply being in a doctors office will send my blood pressure sky high.      I'm 11 weeks pregnant and my doctor visits so far have been good because I knew what to expect from each one (although I did sit there and bawl when they drew my blood). On my second visit, they did the physical exam and I was fine except that my BP was over 160 due to anxiety.      Anyhow, my question is, does anyone know of any techniques that I can use to help control my fear? I don't know the root cause of the fear. With the glucose test on the horizon and more blood tests I want to be able to control myself.      Any tips or advice?

But her underwear were really thin and so were his boxers. She says that she felt his penis touch her inner leg near her vagina and was really wet. She told me that she had her period three days later, but is now 3 days late for her period and has a bump on her stomach. She has been experiencing heartburn, dizziness, lower back pains, and when she pushed on her stomach she feels like she is going to throw up, and and has been experiencing headaches, along with clear fluid in her underwear. Isn't it close to impossible to get pregnant from this?

On Wednesday, he and I were having a bit of oral. The only thing we did was kiss and he "made love" to my breasts. We were both in underwear but his penis was out because he got a *****. There was a time when things got a little more intense(not sex related) and his penis accidently went on my undies and where my vagina sits. He did get wet but I'm not sure if he got wet on my undies. He never ejaculated. I was wearing thin underwear that's made out of 94% cotton,90% nylon and 10% spandex. He did NOT ejaculate but I am worried if sperm mightve accidently went in me and if there might be a chance of me getting pregnant. I'm confused about ovulation and.  I don't know exactly when I ovulate. I am dead worried. Some people said that there a chance and some said that it's impossible for sperm to travel through underwear. Also, I got wet from the inside of my undies.   Sorry if this was long and disgusting but please help because I'm extremely worried...

I've been using a cheap internet strip-type test (not the type you buy in the stores), and I've been comparing the intensity of the lines.  Today was the day I was supposed to start my period, so I've been worried that I'll lose the pregnancy. I got a really dark line yesterday after about four hours of not drinking anything or going to the bathroom. Twelve hours later, I took another test with first morning urine and the line hadn't changed, if anything it was lighter.  I did get up a few times last night, and I had some water to drink about four hours before I took the test, and I also went to the bathroom at that time... Am I going to lose this pregnancy? My doctor won't even consider doing a blood test until I'm at least a week late. My last pregnancy ended in a missed miscarriage at nine weeks. Thanks.

Now he choses to either fall asleep standing up with his head on bed or on the floor.  If I try to move him to his bed he wakes up and moves right back on to the floor immediately.  Is it bad for me to just let him sleep there?

So my RE prescribed Clomid (he said progesterone alone would be insufficient). I am on my first Clomid cycle.

20090203052822AAlyPqk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	What are my chances of full custody?	I have 2 granddaughters that I have had for 8 months (2 years old & 10 months). Their parents divorced.The mother gave up full custody to my son to be with a man on drugs who soon got her on them (She is up on pending drug charges as we speak). She has just moved back in w/ her mother who is no better. My son joins the military and they both signed temporary custody over to me. He is is NY living in a 1 room apartment. Cannot manage his finances. Remarries a girl after dating 1 month, now going through a divorce with another woman staying w/ him now. He has recently been talking to his ex (the mother of the children) and is mad at me because I will not let the children stay w/ her over the weekend. I am not wanting to take the children away from their mother. I just want whats best for the children. He is telling me he is going to try to get them back and give them back to her. I really do not think that will happen, but what I am asking is how hard would it be to gain full custody of the children? I live in the state of Ga. I have had the baby since was 3 weeks old. She only knows me. She has maybe visited the children 5 times for a few minutes. My son has only seen them a few times. neither have never given anything to help out. Someone please help me.

Our little boy is 10 weeks old and I just wondered if this sounds like good sleeping habits or is he a poor sleeper?   We take him up to bed in his moses basket next to ours at 10pm. H usually  is awake for 2 hours till 12 then he may sleep until 4. He is changed and then he sleeps for about another 3 hours.   All in all we get about 7-8 hours of sleep a night and he wakes up twice in that time.      I just wondered does this sound normal for a baby of this age and also what age do they usually sleep for longer periods of time?

Only recently just after christmas, he started getting quite close to an old friend of his (female) who he knew years before he met me.    Now this friend has her own partner who she is always having problems with, and has her own place. Ive tried not to let it bug me but they are constantly on the phone to eachother!! Im not a jealous person, but i feel im reallllly being pushed to my limit.... let me give you a few examples.....   I took my partner out for a meal last friday, and who rings... his friend. They have a chat, and then he says, "oh you shouldve come, if we'd known you was at home, you couldbe came for something to eat with us".   Yesterday morning, (uk snowstorm) she called him at like 7.30am, to say shes not at work.... then when me and my partner go out to get some shopping, they are somehow on the phone together AGAIN and he offers to get her in a few bits, and asks her what she needs.... she only says 3 items, but then when we drop it round for her, she offers to pay, and he says dont worry... BUT IM THE ONE WHO PAID FOR IT IN THE FIRST PLACE! Now is it me... or is it just my hormones?? Please honest opinions.... They speal to eachother at least twice a day everyday, he goes to her house, he even went to her work once.   please people what do you think about this... sorry i know its long, really appreciated.

20090219165409AA4mP67	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How do *you* deal with unwanted (and often inaccurate) advice and comments from complete strangers?	I reached the end of my tether the other day. I was in the supermarket and some lady (you'd think a fellow female would know better) exclaimed "OMG you're huge are you having twins?!?!?" Me: "No, just the one" as nicely as i could manage, i was already having a down day.   "But you're so big!"   "Well of course i look big, i'm all of 5 foot nothing. Anyway, the doctor said i'm exactly the right size i need to be."   "Well your doctor's wrong"      WTF?      So now i keep a bunch of my doc's cards in by purse and when people start crapping on like that I hand one over and say "If you have any concerns or questions about my pregnancy i'm sure my doctor would be happy to discuss that with you." Shuts them up pretty quick.      (Sorry for the lil whinge-fest by the way)

My period was around the 15 but it's irregular . But always longer than 28 days. I had 2 ultrasounds done one at the ER said I was 5 weeks 6 days (they also said the heart rate was 112)and my due date was October 3. I had one yesterday and was told I was 8 weeks 3 days and my due date was Setember 27. I can't stop worrying about this and I don't want a abortion. I told my ex about it and he says he wants nothing to do with the baby if it's his. I have looked into doing the DNA testing while pregnant but finding a doctor to do it at a low cost is the hard part. Has anyone been in this situation? Who is most likely the father? Please don't judge me I already feel bad as it is. I'm just looking for some peace of mind.

20090203060024AAMg8KV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How can I attend my daughter's parent's evening?	The situation is; my daughter lives with her father and his wife. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks and we found it best for our daughter to live with her father to receive the best care. My daughter is 12.   I wish to attend her parents evening. My partner would come with me in my car and offer me support, which I would need.   However, my ex and his wife said that they already have times fixed to talk to my daughter's different teachers. I rang the school and they said that in the circumstances, it may be best if I only speak to one teacher for all the feedback as they can't arrange separate times for me to see my daughter's teachers.   I know I have a right to see each of my daughter's teachers to get a better idea of her progress and I don't want to just see one teacher. The school expects me to work something out with my ex. I have tried but he refuses to meet me half way at all. They just want to go along and see my daughter's teachers as if they were her parents, if you understand.   We have been to court and have had contact orders. We are due to return to court soon for yet another directions hearing. They frequently break contact and want me to be flexible yet they are not. When I have been unwell with anxiety, they see that as an excuse (and I only wish it was).   Does anyone have any advice as to what I should do about the parent's evening?   Many thanks

However I haven't had a period since Dec. 31 and I had a pregnancy dream. So I took the target brand of ept and both were positive. I think I checked after 10 minutes, but they weren't evaporation lines.  They were blue. So I took the easy digital and it was not pregnant. I took it again in the  morning and again, it was negative. I guess Target's brand was messed up. I am a little sad, which is silly because 2 kids should be enough. Anyone have similar stories?

I have babysat for a family 3 times now and they have an 8 year old boy. Last weekend I went down to their tv room to see what he was up to, and I found him sitting on the floor with his pants and underwear off, and the family dog between his legs. He was letting the dog lick his dink. He was actually erect.      I wasn't sure what to do! I probably made a mistake but I just went back upstairs. I guess I should have went in and stopped him, but I didn't know what to say.      Should I have gone in and stopped him? I guess I should tell his mom, but not sure how to. Later on, I thought maybe I should have stopped him. I mean what if the dog bit him?      Why would this boy be doing that?

Just recently I decided it was time to do some serious toning on my tummy.  I have been working on it for about a month now with great results.  BUT, within the last week I have had a weird pulling sensation, its like a dull pain that comes and goes where my c-section was at.  Its not all the time, it mainly happens when I bend over and pick up my son or before I start working out, after working out I don't feel it, its not until a few hours later or even the next day.   My stomach has really flattened up, I almost have no sign of a baby pouch any more, but I was just wondering if anyone else has noticed this after getting back in better shape.    Do you know what causes this?

He really likes avocado, peas & cereal but fruits seem like they do not sit well with him.  I eat meat now- (I've just been craving it like crazy since I got pregnant & have been nursing & hubby pays for groceries so it's just been the simplest way to ensure a balanced diet- but still lame I know)   anyway- I know that meat, especially factory farm meat isn't all that healthy.  I will probably feed my son some meat, but I would like the bulk of his diet to consist of fresh veggies, fruits, legumes etc.  I was just wondering if anyone knows of any sites/books/sources w/info on balanced veggie diets for growing babies & children.  I was vegan, then vegetarian for several years, but I know my diet was never completely balanced- so I just want to get my son started on the right track.  Of course I'm going to talk this over w/his doc as well- so no *helpful* suggestions such as "talk to your doctor," please.   Thanks : )

I took the minipill while I nursed for 11 months, then switched to Yaz in late November/early december. I was fine the 1st month but ever since then I have had a lot of nausea. I do not think its an unplanned pregnancy cause I have never missed a pill or period while on it, also I do not have the same symptoms as my first pregnancy save for nausea, actually this nausea is worse. Anyhow, I have also had a poor appetite and some weight loss tho I hear you often lose a few pounds when you stop nursing. I was wondering if it could be the pills. I have used different pills in the past with little or no problems. I knwo if I don't get better further tests whatever is needed, but I am a working mom of a 13 month old son, so you can understand why I'd rather skip that if I can esp. if changing pills would help the situation. Before I starting trying to get pregnant with #1 I took orto tri cylcen and had zero problems when I started taking them.

The cake has been sitting on the counter. It is store bought. After eating it, I wondered what was in it, like milk in the icing. Then sitting on the counter. I wasn't feeling well last night, but it's likely all in my head. The baby was moving a lot. I ate it around 12 hours ago.  I've felt him move a little today, not much. But I've been busy.  I feel fine.  I lost my last pregnancy, so I'm a little paranoid.      Do you think the icing on the cake could have caused a food born illness of some type from sitting on the counter for 3 days unrefrigerated?  There's milk in icing.

20090220092708AAKxPKm	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	4 Weeks, 4 Days in Early Pregnancy?	Here I go AGAIN!       I woke up this morning and had brown blood. It wasn't a lot...it came out in about 4 drops and then nothing else. After that I had the brown discharge as I wiped. Never red...no cramps.      Well I went to the ER (I'm sure they're TIRED of seeing me) and found out that TODAY, I am 4 weeks and 4 days pregnant. They did an internal and external ultrasound as well as an internal exam to test for bacterial infections and check my cervix.      The doctor said that she didn't see any new (red) blood and that my cervix was closed. She also told me that when they saw the pics from the ultrasound, they didn't see anything but that it was "far too early" to have seen anything right away. My HCG is at 75 (after a blood test). I have to go to the doctor on Monday to see where they are after that and if they have gone down...well, you know.      What do you ladies make of this? As of right now, I am resting in the bed, legs propped up and PRAYING super hard that this is viable.      Thoughts PLEASE?

20090203070952AAN1U95	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Has anyone dated a man with children?	My boyfriend and I have been dating for about 18 months. We live together. Their mother has decided to bail and the children will be coming to live with us when school is over in June. I love him and his kids. However, I am being realistic and know that this will be a big responsibility for me because I don't have any children. He and I have talked about married and have always seen that in our futures together. With such a huge responsibility coming up, do you think I have a right to ask him how soon it will happen now? I would never give him an ultimatum but I would like a time line. I will be living with him and being sort of a wife and mother to his children, so I feel I deserve the same level of commitment from him.   What do you think? How can I handle it?

They have 3 kids, 2 twin girls and a another little girl as well. The twins are about 3 years old, and the other one is a baby, about 9 months old. I'm going to meet them tomorrow, and I want to put a good first impression on them. I am not sure what to say, but I want to some how mention that I am a babysitter. Now here is the question, for parents, would you let me babysit you're kids? I am 13 and very mature for my age. If so, please say why, and if not, please explain as well. I love kids, and I know kids love me. Another question, when I go to meet them for the first time, how should I bring up the subject about me babysitting? I don't want to go to their house, then say "Hey, can I babysit your kids?". I want to be more like 'welcome to the neighborhood' and stuff like that. 10 points for the most helpful information(:

But now I am randomly getting sick (this doesn't happen to me, I NEVER get sick). And yesterday I started spotting. It's pretty light, but heavier than any other spotting i've ever had.

20090220085458AAtlmSB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Best formula for babies with reflux?	Hi, I have a beautiful 2-month old baby who was diagnosed with severe reflux. His pediatrician prescribed zantac, but that has not helped much. We switched to a hipoallergenic formula (Similac Alimentum) and although he was no longer having horrible episodes of reflux, the taste of the formula is so horrible he would eat only 1/3 of what he used to. I called the pediatrician, who told me to mix the formula he likes (Similac Sensitive) with the hipoallergenic one. My son is eating better, but his reflux came back with a vengeance. My pediatrician said there is little he could do and we should wait until he 'grows out of it". I can't just sit there and see by baby crying in pain.       Any parents who have been through the same? What did you do? Is there a formula that worked for you? I am tired of buying different kinds that do not work!

20090220093643AAEjrEf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Boundaries for parents (esp. in-laws) with your children?	I'm just curious about what kinds of boundaries other people make for their parents and in-laws concerning their children.  One of the reasons I ask, is that my husband and I disagree somewhat in one area.  I don't think it's appropriate for my parents or his to lay with our child and nap with him (he's a year old), since we don't even do this.  My husband and I haven't done this since he was a little baby (and only once in a while now), but I think it's good to teach our children that they can only be in bed with mom and dad.  It's a simple rule, easy for him to get.  It's not that I think either of our parents will do anything (of course!) but if he can be in bed with grandparents, then it gets extended to aunts and uncles... and then friends... and I just feel it's better to have a simple boundary.  And the same for baths.  Should only be IN the tub with mom or dad.  My FIL went in the bath with my niece when she was 3 - that would NOT be okay with me.  Hmmm... anyways, just wondering if I am a bit overboard (like my husband thinks! :) ) or if others agree.  I appreciate your input and look forward to different perspectives.
20090220093815AAPdnRS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?	Children with developmental and/or physical disabilities playing Little League?   I was wondering if anyone out there has a child with a mild to moderate developmental and/or physical disability who plays in Little League baseball in their area. My 8 year old son has multiple learning disabilities and some motor skill issues from being hit by a car a few years ago. You really wouldn't know unless you really interacted with him. I recently put him in our local LL Baseball league. I'm kind of worried because a lot of these kids have be playing for a while and my son is new so he doesn't really know how to play the game. But they are also very good at it with the throwing and catching. Some of them are also very competitive. My son takes a long time to learn sometimes and I worry that some of the kids yelling at him for making mistakes will start to get to him. He told me he likes to play when I asked him and his coach told him he did a good job at the end of practice. When I enrolled him I wanted him to have fun, but I didn't take into consideration the competitiveness of his teammates. I didn't tell the coach about his issues because I didn't want him to judge him ahead of time. But now I worry that I jumped the gun when I enrolled him. I don't know what to do. Does anyone out there have a child with these issues that plays LL? How was their experience?

My son ended up taking him to the hospital after a series of clumsy incidents.. I'm not really sure what to call it.      What I mean by this is the boy had:      hit the corner of a wall and somehow cut his face beside his eye      slipped outside and sprained his ankle, as well as landing with his arm on a stump, and it looking very swollen and bleeding internally (the reason for the hospital visit)      He had also knelt on a razor last night after digging through his bag. he didn't tell us until this morning and tended to it himself using one of his t-shirts.      somehow he also managed to stub his toe on a vacuum cleaner and tear the skin open, that bled for a few hours.      What I want to know is, is it normal for a 13 year old boy to be overly clumsy? (his mother says events like this are common and he has recently had an optometrists appointment and does not need glasses) Or, should he see a different optometrist or could something else be wrong?

My husband is in Iraq but is coming home on leave early march to see me and the baby for 2 weeks. My due date is the 28th, but i want to see if i can be induced early just so i have a little time to heal before he gets here. I really dont want to still be pregnant or not want to do anything when he gets home, because i havent seen him in over 5 months. Do you think if i asked my doctor and told her that i would like to be induced for this reason that they might help me out? I have not had many signes of labor yet, i lost my mucus plug a while ago and have some pain, but not much has happened. I would just really like him to be out so that i wont have to worry about him being too late and my husband not getting much time with him before he goes back to iraq. I see my doctor monday and im already registered with the hospital.

I was cleaning out my bathroom drawer today and realized that I had tossed it in there instead of the trash. Before I threw it away, I looked at it again and now it's showing a faint positive.      I'm going to test again, but I thought I'd see if anyone had any thoughts on this. Will it suddenly change like that? When I took it I checked it at 5 minutes, then left it out and checked again at 30 min just to be safe and it was still negative at that point.

20090220102250AArLyka	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Stay at home moms. how do you do it?	I'm a working mom, a teacher and as much time as i have off, getting off at 3:15 and occasionally having weekdays off for MLK day and things like that I still feel like I don't get enough time to spend with my 6 month old daughter.  I hate when I come home and I'm too tired to play with her as much as I'd like.  So I try not to work so hard at work but being a teacher that makes me feel guilty as well.  So since I can't give it 100%, I'd like to quit until my daughter and the next child I hope to have are older.  The thing is, my husband is a teacher too so I just don't see how we could afford it.  How do you all cope financially?  What do your husbands do for work if you don't mind my asking.  I'm not trying to be nosy its just it seems there are many stay at home moms and I'm wondering how they manage.  I don't demand a lot, I almost never go shopping for myself although i do like to go out to eat occasionally and by that i mean like twice a month.  I just want to live comfortably and be able to help my children out with college.  I also don't want to miss out on their babyhood.

20090220102624AAsakvf	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How can I make my 20 month old sleep in her own bed?	My daughter has always slept in her own crib in her own room until about two months ago. Although she wakes up frequently at night she did sleep in her room. She usually wakes up to drink water,or drops her pacifier or she just gets scared and wants mommy. Daddy won't do usually, I need to hold her for 10 min to half an hour to calm her down and when she falls a sleep I put her down in her bed again. But lately she just won't sleep in her bed, we tried everything. We read to her, sang to her, sat next to the bed, left a night light on, we even tried not doing anything. She cried non stop for 2 hrs and it was terrible for all of us. So that option is out. Now she sleeps with mommy every night, she does wake up a few times still but goes right back to sleep. She sleeps better but we had to kick daddy out. Any suggestions how to get her back to sleeping in her own bed?

I was due on the 17th and it is now the 20th of Feb. This morning I tested with and HPT and it was negative. Then at 8 am I had a sudden cramp and when I went to the bathroom I wiped some discharge that had a slight brownish tint with little red spots and regular discharge. I thought maybe it was my period starting so I put a tampon on and I went along my way to my Endocrinologist appointment I had scheduled. I had them do a blood test for pregnancy in case this was implantation( They do it thre b/c with thyroid problems you have know asap when you get pregnant b/c it needs to be monitored closely....but I won't know for a couple of days what the result it). Anyway, it is now 1:03 pm and the tampon had nothing but a tiny tinge of brown on it and I have no period flow at all!    Could this be implantation, or is it too late to have it? Mostly I thought it happened a couple of days before your period or on it...not after you missed your period.

I have been sitting him in this since about 4 months. I am now starting to think that he isn't wanting to sit still in it because he doesn't have very much room between his crotch area and his back. He is 26 pounds now.  I cant seem to find a weight requirement for this chair.  Either way, this chair isn't working for us anymore. The buckle is missing now and he can just stand right up when he is finished. GOSH! I also don't like that little plastic part over his legs that the tray snaps too. It wont come off.

20090219194030AA6MzlC	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Just want to know how your toddler acts around other kids?	My 18 month old son has been around other children before a few times in the past when he was younger and acted fine but he really hasn't been around many kids very much, he's been around adults more. But lately i've brought him around my friends daughter who's almost 10 months and the first time he met her he tried to make friends with her, he was even trying to kiss and hug her. She kinda started cryin cause he grabbed her toy and she started crawling fast towards him and i guess that scared him so he started running towards me and was crying and acting scared. Well past couple of times i've brought him around her when she starts laughing and crawling towards him he starts freaking out and crying and running towards me for me to pick him up. He even started becoming really tense and hyperventilating sorta and breathing hard so is this normal? Or do kids act like this at first if they haven't been around other children very much? He watches her and acts interested like he wants to play but then when she crawls towards him or trys to touch him he just freaks out.

20090203072619AACMNGS	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	My husband has no patience with the baby? Red flags?	When she is fussy (most of the time) and i ask him to pick her up, he'll like throw the blanket on her lap in a mean way if it's fallen off a little- he's never hurt the baby or handled her aggressively once he does pick her up, but i'm nervous about lesving them alone a little bit? sometimes i feel  like it's my fault because he can hear it in my voice when i'm frustrated b/c of her fussing (he's gone at work most of the time so i'm alone w/her all day and many nights) but i absolutely would never let her see that i was frustrated by whipping a blankie or the top of her swing around, ya know?
20090203085844AAqXjNP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	My future MIL has said "no grandchildren, ever"?	Isn't that a little weird? I have never heard of it before. She is an elementary teacher, likes kids, and had three planned sons of her own. I have been dating her middle son for many years, her oldest is married and she has told the wife to please not have any children. She told me the same thing when I asked about it, she simply said she never wants any grandchildren and hopes none of us ever get pregnant. Although she didn't forbid us, I feel it's strange that a MIL doesn't ever want grandchildren. I've also noticed she's very phobic about sex and pretends it doesn't happen... could this be why? Does her aversion to grandchildren seem odd to anyone else?
20090203080755AAZG6rK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 weeks pregnant and horrible sleep problems-help?	I don't know what to do about this anymore. I see the OB/GYN in 2 days so I'm going to talk to her, I just wanted to know if anybody had any perspective.       I stop breathing in my sleep. The reason is that my nose is constantly plugged due to being pregnant (OB/GYN says this happens sometimes.) I have a very hard time breathing through my nose during the day, and at night it's completely plugged so I have to breathe through my mouth. I sleep on my side and I will wake up GASPING for breath. It feels like my throat just fell closed. I literally just gulp in the air because I feel like I've been holding my breath or like I've been suffocated. This can happen 10 to 20 times a night. Add to that getting up 5x a night to pee, my husband's chronic snoring, the cat meowing, and sciatica- I'm having a really rough time here. I woke up this morning just bawling for no reason- I think because it's been weeks of bad sleep and my body has had enough.       Anybody going through the same thing? What can I do?
20090203073843AAHiDoW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Four-week-old ... crying it out ... a question!?	I have a four-week-old baby girl.  She doesn't cry all the time or anything, much of the time it's when she's hungry so we just feed her.  But other times she only cries because she wants held.  My first instinct is to run to her side any time she makes a peep.  If she's crying and it's because she wants held, I feel like I should hold her.      My husband thinks we need to just let her cry because we can't stop our lives for long periods of time just to hold the baby...  I'm afraid to do that because she's so little.  What if she hurts herself?  And her cries are SO sad.  It breaks my heart to hear her crying when I know all she wants is for me to hold her.      So what do you guys think?  Is my husband right?  Should I let her cry more often so she learns that we can't be there for her every second?  Or is it possible she could somehow hurt herself from crying too hard?      FYI: She is our third baby, but it has been over six years since I last had a baby so I kind of forget "the rules", so to speak.  Thanks for any input!      If you need more info, ask it in your answer.  I'll come back and check the answers and add details if necessary!
20090203073044AAMVBXI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anyone else have an issue with this?	Okay this is going to sound weird! But I'm 18 wks 3 days now, and talking with the babies dad. I cant tell if hes being funny/joking to get me going. Or If hes serious! Did any of you ladies have a problem with your spouse/partner wanting to wait the 6 weeks at least after you had your baby? Im really worried about labour, and healing and how long it will actually take. I really want to wait at least 2 months, maybe I am being unreasonable, But Id rather be safe then sorry I guess! and ive heard from some woman reading their posts, that sex hurt afterwards for a while or was uncomfortable... can you tell me why this was? Like not healed fully yet, stitches still, Or maybe had a c-section? Or is it just because you went from being dilated back down to your normal size? And then try having sex... Sorry im just curous... And (he would wait, I know but this is both our first babies, and I dont think he understands at this stage how hard it is on a woman's body and that you have to heal!

20090203081537AAaG1P6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Ladies.. Am too impatient I feel.. & btw, Whitney did u test today?	Well, am TTC.  I am supposed to get my periods on 5th or 6th feb. So was going to test on 6th hoping that i get preg.  But while reading through the question answers here, I thought y not try it today? So took a test today morning with the early pregnancy test strips. As per their instructions, I should get a result in 45 seconds but still have to wait 5 minutes for complete reaction. Now my results - didn't get anything in 45 secs except the dark control line. But after exactly 7 minutes, I saw a very very faint line next to control. Again after exactly 16 minutes on the same strip, the line got a little, very little darker than the earlier faint line.  So ladies, what's ur take on this?? Of course I'll retest on 6th. But thought ur suggestions and ur conclusions would be helpful. Btw, Whitney, if u reading this, whats ur result?? looks like we r in the same boat !!!

20090218080723AA6kOrn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Why is spanking considered child abuse?	I'm 21 years old, and I was spanked. From what I'm reading, my generation, and the one slightly before me now, thinks that spanking is abuse, but I don't agree. I think it's a good form of discipline, and a good reminder of who is in charge, and how far to toe the line. My parents raised 3 very well-behaved adults. When we were children, we KNEW better or we were going home, and if we went home, there would be some consequence.      I guess people think it's a fear tatic, but I'm not afraid of my parents, and it kept me in line and not acting liking a zoo animal in public places.      I'm not saying talking is not effective, because I've seen it in action.      But I don't think spanking is, "OMGZ EVUL" either like some make it out to be.      What changed?      Thanks.
20090220060412AAsHyxn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	As a parent do you want to teach your kids at a young age that its not easy making money?	I grew up always being reminded that if I needed new cloths or something to eat when we were away from home that we couldn't afford new cloths, or to eat out!        As an adult I still consistently remind myself what I can't afford, so I wear my cloths right out for years and rarely enjoy a good meal out.       I think its important your child is prepared for the real life, but I wonder if I really want to give my kids that fright to feel like their parents could possibly not be able to provide for them.  Its my job as parent to keep my kids cared for, and I don't want to doubt my ability to do so.        I feel as though its okay to make them believe they have to work for what they want, but not consistently giving them the idea we are poor.  I don't want to play a lie in their heads about our life status, but I just don't want them to worry like I had to about wither I could eat or get new cloths if I couldn't fit into my old ones or they got tore.       I was talking to a little girl the other day on the bus, and she was crying that her lips hurt.  I told her they were chapped, and she needed to get some chap stick. She admittedly said "oh, no my Mom can't afford chap stick" I knew this feeling all to well, and felt pitty that the child was so aware of this.      What do you think? Would you want your kids to have that realisation about money, like it runs their lives right from the beginining?       Thanks for your answers!

I know this is an opportunity that doesn't come up that often and I really need to take advantage of it, but I just can't help feel stressed about the whole situation.

I really think this month could be our month, even though we just started trying a few days ago =] The first day of my last pd was 13 days ago. And my cycles have been off since I stopped taking birth control back in Sept. So they've never started on the day I think I am going to. I noticed earlier today I have just a little CM.. does that mean I'll be ovulating soon? I always know when I'm ovulating because my CM gets really slick and there's a lot of it. I know sometimes, you can get CM confused with left-over sperm (gross, I know), but it wouldn't be resurfacing 2 days later, would it? I always notice it the next day. If I was to get an OPK, should I start using it now, or when should I? My husband and I decided to baby dance every other day for 3 wks, just to be on the safe side. Any advice??

20090203074156AA1xO9m	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is it ok to find your teen daughter hot?	This is not me as I do not have any kids.      My older friend is a very close friend of mine and tells me things that he would not tell other people.  We went out foir some drinks a few weekends ago and we were laughing and joking and had a good time.  I was like, "Who do you think is really hot?" and he is like, "Oh, my daughter, hands down".      So I stop and look at him.  First, I stop to assess how much we both had to drink.  It wasn't much.  Then he turns to me and says, "Hey man, you know I'm a family man and would never do anything with my kid.  Its just like that joke we had when we were in high school.  Someone has a hot sister and they say if she wasn't my sister I would hit it.  Its like that.  You have to admit, she is hot".      So I have to admit, she is very very attractive for 17.  Totally not my cup of tea as I date girls my own age and could not deal with the immaturity.  Yet if we are talking purely on just how pretty she is, she can stop traffic.      So I mean, He's a nice guy and I know he has nothing in his past where he was molested nor would I think he would do that.  So lets not go in that direction with this question... PLEASE.      This question is for a parent spouse... Would you be upset if you found out your husband found your daughter sexually attractive?  Even if you knew but he never told you?         This question is for the daughter...  If you found out that your dad was sexually attracted to you yet you knew he would never say or do anything about it, how would you feel about it or handle it?        Please indicate in your answer if you are a spouse or daughter,  Thanks!

20090220115831AACOL6D	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are the odds of this pregnancy happening?	Hi everyone, I posted a question 3 weeks ago asking "am I pregnant" after only the first month of trying.       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...       Anyhow it turns out that I am 6 weeks and 1 day pregnant after an early scan due to some minor brown spotting a few weeks ago.  The midwife and doctors seemed amazed that I was actually pregnant as I have what they called polycystic ovarys.  They said I should be happy I am pregnant and everything seems good, the babys heart was also beating away like a good one, it really was an amazing experience.      What are the actual odds of getting pregnant in my first month of trying when I have this polycystic ovary syndrome???      I hope this can shed some hope to any others out there who may suffer from this?      Any comments and realistic estimates welcomed

20090203080829AA54Eu8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Why is adoption so expensive?	My fiance and I have always wanted to have two children naturally, and adopt two. We would like to adopt from India. And we don't really want infants. We'd actually prefer to adopt two toddlers (maybe even siblings) from about 2-4 years old.   I always knew that adoption would be costly, but just recently I saw some figures on the web that said it could easily cost up to 35,000 for international adoption! That doesn't include the traveling fees.   Also, the adoption process can take months if not years, and you have to be willing to put up with often unreliable sources in the foreign country that can lose your paperwork and whatnot.      Does anyone out there know from experience or of a website I could go to that can show me how to go about the process, what the fees actually go towards, and (hopefully) if there is a more reliable and less expensive way to go about it?      Oh and my fiance and I are currently in college, and will be making a combined income of about $130-150 once we've got our degrees. So we Could technically afford the ridiculously expensive adoption fees I've read about, but we'd much rather find a less expensive way and use the money we'd save to put toward our childen's futures!

Hi all      Sorry, not the most delightful subject but I just wondered, as a lot of women suffer from constipation during pregnancy, I myself being one of them (I'm having to take Fybogel for a few days every week!), I just wondered as it's often a bit of a 'strain' going to the toilet and we do unfortunately have to push a little...is this a danger to the baby/pregnancy?      It's such an awful part of being pregnant, infact it's about the only thing that's making me feel pregnant at the moment as I have no other side effects/symptoms etc...but it's not a pleasant one and it can cause a great deal of pain!      Wouldn't like to think that straining to go to the toilet is doing damage, even when you've taken Fybogel etc, there's still a bit of a push required to get things moving.....      Thanks everyone! x

20090220063112AAgd44f	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Abortion guys read this and tell me how you feel after it?	As you know, a new administration has taken over the reins of power in america. No doubt, youu've heard much about the new president's promise of change . What you may not of heard of is that he heads the most pro - obortion administration in american history .          Consider this . Almost immediately after assuming power , the new administration realeased millions of dollars to promote abortion internationally . And the new administration is also pushing hard for the passage of a demon - inspired law called `freedom  of choice act` . One of the things this bill would do would do is repeal the american ban on partial birth abortion.      You may have heard of partial birth abortion . It is a very late procedure to kill a baby that only a few weeks from being born , and could easily survive outside the womb . It's one of the most hideous abortion methods imaginable .      Ther are six steps in partial abortion,      1) The abortionist spends to days forcibly dilating the pregnat mother`s cervix.      2) The abortionist uses forceps- a surgecal tool with sharp teeth that resembles a pair of pliers - to reverse the babys position in the womb by pulling the baby's legs down,rotating the baby's head so that it faces away from the birth canal.      3)Weilding the forceps, the abortionists pulls the baby's legs and body into the birth canal until only the head ,which is to large to pass through the cervix , remains in uterus.At this point , the baby is almost entirely delivered!      4) The abortionists then uses a different tool -a sharp pair of sissors-to puncture the base of the baby`s head,causing the baby to writhe desperately in pain.      5) Into the puncture wound the abortionist inserts a tube and then turns on the suction machine to hoover out the baby`s brain . This causes the baby`s body to suddenly go limp.      6) The abortionist crushes the baby`s skull and pulls the fragments through the cervix. The partial birth abortion is over.      I am posting this not to make people who have done this feel worse then they should but to warn other country that the new administration is trying to bring this into every country and as long as im around they wont bring it into my country .       I dont believe in abortion and never will but never really got emotional about abortion until I read this and it really made me sick.      I feel so sorry for america with there new administration because if they can do this then there capable of anything.      My question is how do you feel about this.. americans do you feel sorry that this is allowed and how would other countries react if this came into you home town?

20090220064528AA6cRAq	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Nearly 8 wks pregnant, feel so sick during work, what can I do?	I am nearly 8 weeks pregnant and over the moon, so is my husband, but especially the last week or so I've been feeling terrible!  Its really affecting me and I can hardly concentrate on a thing at work.  I feel so sick all day long, from the minute I get up (not actually been sick at all - yet!), I'm tired beyond words, can't sleep at night, my lower back is aching, then my upper back is aching, I can't eat but my tummys rumbling so eat something then I feel worse.  I know this is all just part and parcel of pregnancy, especially early pregnancy but I don't know if I can stand another 5 weeks of it - and that'll be if I'm lucky.  Has anyone got any ideas of things I could try please?  My midwife said the not sleeping and stuff is all to do with the raging hormones and it should wear off soon.  I really hope so.

20090220072411AAbIHeN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Differences between first and consecutive pregnancies in your experience?	A few questions on my mind...   1. Did you go into labor earlier with your second child?   2. Did you start to show earlier?   3. Were your symptoms throughout pregnancy similar to your first or quite different?   4. Did you make any lifestyle changes after your first pregnancy (regarding eating habits, exercise, etc) and find a noticeable difference in how you felt throughout/or how your labor experience went?    4. Did you choose the same/different route for feeding your consecutive children as with your first (breast or formula)?   5. If you did breastfeed, was it easier the second time around?      Anything else you want to add is appreciated as well...   Thanks :-)

20090220073410AA1CK6D	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Question about watery discharge, 35weeks?	I know the further along in pregnancy the more discharge you have, but for the past 2 days I have been having heavy watery discharge.  Just wanting to know how much discharge is too much and when should I start to be concerned?
20090220073428AAUO93k	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Pregnant but having period-like cramps?	I just found out yesterday that I'm pregnant. I've taken about 4 different kinds of tests just to be sure and they are all positive. I made an appointment with the doctor but they won't see me until March 11th (about 3 weeks from now). The last week and a half I have been having cramps that feel as if my period is about to start. And today they are much stronger...like my period is coming any second. My period would normally arrive in two days. ( I tested positive at 11 dpo). I talked about it with the assistant at the doctor's office and she said it is normal to have those cramps. But I am still very worried as I am surprised at just how exactly they feel like premenstrual cramps. Has anyone else experienced this? Is it normal or a sign of a miscarriage waiting to happen?    Thanks in advance for the advice!
