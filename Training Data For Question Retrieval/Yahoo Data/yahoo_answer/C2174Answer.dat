5wufIH1Haa	I really got into paper embroidery. It sounds hard but its SO easy! You just need cardstock and cross stitch floss, a punch needle, and things you want to add. The designs are made for cards so not only are you doing a craft that is quick and easy (for those of us who like instant gratification) you can sell, share, give these cards for ANY occasion. You'll never have to buy another card again and they are fun because you can add and do anything to them. I like to add different paper colors under it and shape them with ridged scissors.    Here is a link a book with patterns. Basically you photocopy the picture, punch the holes into a piece of card stock, follow the pattern to make the image, and glue to other card and and embellishments. Its easy!    http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-t...|`|ea3d6cd28eff550322ecdeca90a7475daa	How about learning to Crochet?  You can make clothing, scarves, mitts, etc.  The library should have some "how to " books, and the projects are small enough to travel wherever you go. Good luck.|`|znPMSh8paa	I WISH I had started scrapbooking when I was younger. It's probably one of the easiest hobbies to get started with. I can't think of anyone who couldn't do it; you basically need photos, a scrapbook to put them in, and some supplies to dress up the album- paper, adhesive, and perhaps some other embellishments and tools. You can get really fancy with it, or not. I list some of my favorite scrapbooking web sites in the sources so you can see some examples. Like I said, I wish I had started doing this when I was younger.    Photography is another worthwhile hobby.    Crochet, knitting, quilting, painting, sewing and other crafts are all fun hobbies too. There are a lot of possibilities. What interests you? If you're really interested in fashion, perhaps you would enjoy making your own clothes by sewing or knitting them.     Hope you'll find something you really enjoy.|`|JGpirCtLaa	Scrapbooking =)  I'm 19, I love it!|`|WQECudWkaa	aaawww, c'mon give quilting a try.   you are never too young, my great-grandmother started me off when I was about 4yrs.  then I could only thread the needles for her, but I loved it it, still do.

tmnSVMQsaa	If by "normal gameplay" you mean split-screen play on the same console, you can not play any maps that have tanks in this. The four maps that do not work for normal gameplay are seelow, outskirts, roundhouse, and downfall. I have tried to see if i could play these maps on split screen but there is no possible way, at least on the 360 and ps3 versions. As for new maps, Daniel Suarez, executive producer for Call of Duty: World at War has said that they aim to bring out two or three map packs out for multiplayer maps as well as zombie maps and add-ons. The maps will likely be downloadable for a price at the psn or for purchase with xbox live points similarly to the the cod4 map expansion packs. The packs are rumoured to be released around summer 2009.    Hope I Helped

AA10726404	I've never heard of his system, but I'll bet you $10,000 right now, that it is worthless.    See if there really was some clever math system of winning the lottery, then we'd be seeing all these stories on the news about an MIT Lottery Team that just won another big prize.    If someone really had a working system, they would keep it to themselves, and win plenty of money.  Selling the system would run the risk that the lottery would change the rules somehow to make the system fail.    But the fact is the lottery is purely a random event.  The numbers that happened last week, have no impact on what is drawn this week.  There are no 'cold' numbers and there are no 'hot' numbers.  It is purely random chance.  No amount of study or clever betting is going to make any difference at all.|`|ca986effbf18b1196b22a5154e020d6aaa	In spite of people telling you that any individual number has an equal chance of being drawn you will never see 1,2,3,4,5, or 6 in a row in your life time when you are trying to pick several numbers from the same pool of numbers.  This is because there tends to be a BALANCE TO RANDOMNESS when multiple numbers are being picked from a pool of numbers.  If all you are trying to pick is one number out of 53 than yes, each individual one number has an equal chance of being chosen.  This all changes when you are trying to pick multiple random numbers out of the same pool of numbers. Out of, say, a pool of 53 numbers, you will see numbers somewhat spread out from 1 to 53 within the range of the numbers of the particular Lotto you are playing.  The major Lotto games have you choose five numbers with a separate mega number.   This being so, your 5 numbers should add up to around 150 to 165.  Add up the last 100 lotto results and see what the average totals are.  Pick your numbers to add up within that range.  As your mega number use the number that is the most frequently one picked from the stats given on the lotto website.  For the California Mega Lotto it is  36.  Or just use any mega number as this is the case where any one number is just as likely to be drawn as any other number.  Good Luck.|`|ciDR2kpTaa	And all for the price of??
fPavekfeaa	The creature you are stealing control of is already "in play" since it is in the in-play zone and must be in this zone for unwilling recruit to be able to target it. Also unwilling recruit does not remove it from play and then return it to play under your control it just shifts the control of the creature to you. So no any "comes into play" ability would not trigger.    Under normal rules It would have summoning sickness as any creature which has not been under your control since the start of your turn has summoning sickness.     However, unwilling recruit gives the creature haste so it would not be subject to summoning sickness unless your opponent can respond by removing haste from it before you declare it as an attacker. However he would not be able to stop you from using any tap abilities of the creature as tapping a creature is always a cost and paying a cost can not be interrupted.|`|7XGa9zcdaa	Yes, it is considered to have summoning sickness on the first turn it comes into play under your control.

iYWHCNhCaa	My boyfriend got it, i think its pretty common!!  I would get a PS3, he has them both and rarely ever plays his xbox. The graphics on PS3 are alot better and more realistic|`|IlndnVyBaa	I am not exactly sure of the different kinds of xbox 360 and which one gets the RROD more, I think I may have heard that the elite one might get the problem more but I am not positive. I am probably wrong.    Anyways the general faliure rate is 16%. But if it does fail they will give you a free xbox live card and repair it for free, if you bug them enough I think that they will give you more stuff to compensate for your dissatisfaction. I think 360 is better because the graphics are better but the price is a lot lower. I think its worth it because they give you a 3 year warranty, unlike nintendo's one year warranty|`|vZdiZzBYaa	there is never a guarantee you won`t get RRoD. that chance is always there. i would just go ahead and get it.|`|7efLTsF0aa	In most places i know you have to send the X-Box away to Microsoft to get it fixed. I believe the error is less common on newer models and the elite version.    The 360 has better games imo, but the PS3 has Blue Ray and MGS.    I have a Wii and 360 so i'd recommend the 360, i've never had the ring of death|`|IDdnMfYFaa	It all depends on where you place it...  if you place it next to a heater, your chances are high, or packed tight against stuff. If you leave away from other things, also getting an inter cooler will help a lot.|`|AA10974251	I've had my 360 for over two years, and it has been great, no RRod.  Microsoft will fix it (eventually!) if it does go wrong, so you shouldn't be too worried.  The choice of games compared to the PS3 make it the best choice for me...and the graphics on some games are pretty much as good as PS3, certainly good enough - it's not all about graphics anyway, when you look at the range and quality of games, the xbox wins every time for me, but I guess it depends on whether you really want a game that is exclusive to PS3...|`|SNACHcceaa	Umm Xbox 360s don't all had red ring of death, uhh i had mine from a power surge, others get theres because of a heat problem. There's not much of a chance that it will read disks again but you could always try. I had to buy another one. |`|WCjy2c5haa	Right now, the failure rate is around 30%. All the models have about the same chance of the RRoD.    The PS3's failure rate is under 5% or something like that.    Most places have warranties like that.|`|VVC8dk5caa	i dont know|`|pNQTNacZaa	ok, just go get yourself a 360!  don't you realize how much better they are than ps3's?  you xbox live marketplace and what not!|`|db587d4501406a6e1fa3be81eb6e4a17aa	The Xbox 360 model that has the lowest chances of RROD is the Xbox 360 Elite for $399 (the Xbox 360 Elite is not RROD free). The Xbox 360 Arcade and 60GB 360 have a slightly higher chance of getting the RROD.    If you are worried about getting the RROD, I recommend to just wait until Microsoft starts shipping out 360's that have the newer chips in them, but until then, I recommend a PS3.    The Xbox 360's failure rate right now is around 15% right now, but it used to be 33% whenever the 360 first launched.

Remove the connection and clean all the corrosion, and ensure the connection is tight when reconnecting it.|`|0103b1a507155889458dda02bfeae782aa	You have a bad connection. Remove and use a wire brush on both connecting surfaces. This should be an indication that  the maintenance of all the connections need to be cleaned. All the batteries should be cleaned regularly to prevent bridge leaking across the poles. This is done by mixing baking soda and water and with a brush scrub the batteries, then rinse with water. Cart batteries are expensive to replace and this procedure will extend the life. Maintain distilled water levels. Remember these batteries are full of acid.  http://www.doityourself.com/stry/cleanca...  http://homeparents.about.com/cs/househol...  click on these for complete instructions

bf21744950a0e70ac2f2fa2a6a3f0708aa	Hello "JessiDo",    lol, I just learned that in my history class.  Back in the 1800's I think it was there was nothing for college students to do when they stayed indoors during winter.  Some guy created an activity for the students to entertain themselves and it was most popular with college students.  They played half court, and the net did not have a hole at the bottom lol.  Hope this answers your question and most regards to you as long as fate allows it! ^-^    Respectfully,  GrayFox|`|fccb192af4392213479ef0cf5ade519daa	Basketball is unusual in that it was invented by one person, rather than evolving from a different sport. In early December 1891, Dr. James Naismith, a Canadian physician of McGill University and minister on the faculty of a college for YMCA professionals (today, Springfield College) in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA, sought a vigorous indoor game to keep his students occupied and at proper levels of fitness during the long New England winters. Legend has it that, after rejecting other ideas as either too rough or poorly suited to walled-in gymnasiums, he modified a Mayan game and wrote the basic rules and nailed a peach basket onto the 10-foot (3.05 m) elevated track. In contrast with modern basketball nets, this peach basket retained its bottom. Therefore balls scored into the basket had to be poked out with a long dowel each time. Women's basketball began in 1892 at Smith College when Senda Berenson, a physical education teacher, modified Naismith's rules for women. The first official basketball game was played in the YMCA gymnasium on January 20, 1892 with nine players, on a court just half the size of a present-day NBA (NBA) court. "Basket ball", the name suggested by one of Naismith's students, was popular from the beginning.|`|6c84012ce67643573049f6576264c342aa	Basketball was actually invented in Massachusetts after a couple of kids started throwing a tennis ball in a trash can. They moved the trashcan higher and higher until they aimed up to shoot. They also used bigger balls. Hence basketball was created- wow that sounds like  a school essay.....tho it isn't lol|`|0eecaa6ce026993f7cceb785ef3d5eeeaa	wow rock on are u kidding ur wrong. basketball started by a gym teacher and he had a peach basket and had dodge ball and started making up rules|`|a99a062b410b084095999cb62d45d45aaa	I think it started when some person threw a ball and saw that it bounced and thus the basketball was made.

Vou comprar um PSP s para poder jogar este jogo em multiplayer ( o sonho de todos que s?o apaixonados por ele). Bem, este  um RPG de estratgia para console, para PC eu gosto muito dos jogos da srie Heroes of Might & Magic e dos jogos Civilization. Nos dois casos s?o os jogos mais antigos que me agradam, no HM&M eu gosto da arte -  um jogo de estratgia RPG fantasia, os cenrios s?o de regi?es negras, terras em fogo, tudo muito legal -, a jogabilidade n?o  de primeira e o jogo come?a um pouco lento; nos Civi eu gosto do esquema das tecnologias, mas preciso admitir que o jogo  um pouco limitado em termos de estratgia para vencer a batalha (normalmente a estratgia expansionista  a nica a se seguir) e que depois de um tempo ele exige muita aten??o da nossa parte, os cenrios s?o grandes, eu fico perdido.

Account sharing is NOT allowed.    You may not sell, transfer or lend your account to anyone else, or permit anyone else to use your account, and you may not accept an account that anybody else offers you.    Related Questions  Below are some related questions which may help you to further understand and follow this rule.    Why do we have this rule?    We have this rule for two reasons:        * Firstly, many of the accounts people try to sell are actually accounts they have stolen, so, by buying the account you are helping them profit from their crime, and encouraging them to do it more!      * Secondly, this rule is for your protection, as people who share accounts run the risk that the person using the account won't give it back, or that the person will break a game rule causing your account to be banned.    What about swapping my account with another player?    This is considered account trading, so it is not allowed under the game rules.    Can I sell the 'time' I have put into the account?    No. Under the game rules each account should only be used by one person. This applies throughout the lifetime of that account. In order to sell the 'time' you have put into an account, you would have to transfer or lend the account to someone else, thereby breaking the game rules.    My 'brother/sister/friend/other' borrowed my account and broke a rule and now it's banned: Please can you unban it?    Account sharing is not allowed, so if you break this rule and do so anyway you will be responsible for the consequences. The offence won't be removed because you shouldn't have let someone else use your account in the first place.    I share my account with a family member and/or friend, is that allowed?    No, this is not allowed. Sharing your account with anyone, including family members and/or friends, means that you are breaking a game rule and can lead to your account being banned.    I have seen an account for sale on Ebay, what should I do?    Please rest assured that members of Jagex staff check all known auction sites on a daily basis to ensure that no RuneScape accounts are sold via online auctioning web sites.    It should be remembered that all accounts (and items) remain the property of Jagex at all times, and we will not hesitate to remove such items from the game if we have evidence that rule breaking has taken place.    To keep RuneScape enjoyable for everyone please observe and follow this rule. We will not tolerate disruptive players, and if you break our rules your account is likely to be banned. Members who are banned for breaking our rules are not entitled to any sort of refund.

The minimum system requirements necessary to play Need For Speed: Most Wanted Black Edition are as follows.    *  Windows 2000 or XP  *  1.4GHz Pentium IV or comparable processor  *  256MB RAM  *  A video card with at least 32MB of video memory with DirectX 9.0c (or higher) compatible drivers, supporting one of the chipsets listed below.  *  At least 3GB of available hard disk space  *  DirectX 9.0c (or higher) installed  *  A DirectX compliant sound card  *  8X CD-ROM Drive    Although Direct3D is supported, this support is only officially extended to certain 3D accelerator devices. The following major D3D chipsets are supported.    ATI Radeon 7500  ATI Radeon 8500  ATI Radeon 9xxx series  ATI Radeon Xpress 200  ATI Radeon X300, X600, X700, X800 series  NVIDIA GeForce 2 (GTS, MX, Ultra/Ti)  NVIDIA GeForce 3 (Ti)  NVIDIA GeForce 4 (MX, Ti)  NVIDIA GeForce FX series  NVIDIA GeForce 6200, 6600, 6800, 7800  Intel 950/i915g  S3 GammaChrome S18 Pro    While Direct3D supports a wider variety of 3D accelerator devices, the behavior of Need for Speed Most Wanted cannot be predicted in these situations.

zpQ7gDlzaa	If you already have a PSP phat, don't invest in a slim one.  The only real advantage is the size.  If you don't have one at all, then I'd suggest a phat over a slim - less money and all the features work just fine.    The DSi, on the other hand, will have a significant advantage over both the original DS and the Lite.  It's supposed to have an SD slot and a channel-based menu (like the Wii), among other things.  If you're looking at upgrading one or the other, this one's the way to go.|`|cgdOMY08aa	psp way better!!!!!|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	I say get a DSi because the PSP doesn't have that many games to choose from.

PTovC2Dqaa	HERCULES  ------------------  HP: 450  EXP: 700    When Hercules is glowing yellow in color, he's invulnerable. When he stops to flex and admire his muscles, pick up a barrel and toss it at him. The hit of the barrel causes the yellow glow to go out, thus making him vulnerable for a short period of time. The trick is to throw the barrel at very close range, so that you can react with a combo of attacks as he recovers.    Once Hercules is back on his feet, RUN AWAY! His next moves are really devastating. Use the Glide ability to fly around the arena to avoid his ground attacks and when he charges like a bull. Notice that when Hercules finishes his spinning tornado attack with his sword, he gets loopy and might open to attack if he isn't glowing yellow. Dodge him until he starts to swagger, then use this opportunity to attack with several more hits.    When he's not glowing yellow during these attacks, you can end his rage by counterattacking at just the right moment. But it's very tricky to stand in front of a stampeding hero. It's safer to wait until he starts to glow yellow and admire his own strength once again. Then you can start the entire strategy over again. :)|`|vtJDHJDYaa	Sora fights this tricky battle alone. Hercules starts out glowing yellow, meaning he's invincible to your attacks. Just continue dodging him until barrels start appearing. When he says something like, "Hey, give up yet?"  he'll flex his muscles. Take this opportunity to huck a barrel at his head. This causes the glow to disappear temporarily, and this is when you should go in and attack.     One if the more noticeable attacks is when he tries to ram you. At this point, use the Guard ability to stun him. When he says, "Try this on for size!" run away or be hurt. He lunges and punches a lot, but a dodge roll should avoid this attack easily. He also jumps into the air and slams into the ground, causing a shock wave to radiate outward. Another attack he has is a spinning one in which he spins about the battlefield. Outlast this attack, and Herc will be dizzy for a bit.|`|bjmDAjnpaa	throw barrels at him to break his shield. once it's down, hack and slash away!     good luck!!

SEwqwjPkaa	I can't believe some of the answers you're getting. This is a completely legitimate question and from what I gather, you're looking for pointers, tips, and anything else helpful. Sorry for the losers who only reply with a "practice" answer. Sux. Anyway, I'm long winded so go get a nice cold beverage and sit down for this read...    The one member kind of got it right... you don't want to get too comfortable with the auto-aim in the SP campaign. This will definitely give you a handicap online in MP matches. If you can practice in SP mode without auto-aim you'll get better for sure. And remember, when shooting your gun, if an automatic like a LMG or other machine gun, use short bursts. Don't hold down the trigger and spray the bullets all over the map. This is only going to make you very inacurate with your shots. When you line up on an enemy, don't immediately shoot...follow his character with your sight for maybe a second to ensure you're going to get a clean shot, then fire. You'll also want to try altering the sensitivity of your controller. The more sensitive, the quicker the movement, the less sensitive, the slower your movements. See?    Another tip I found helpful...definitely make use of the cover in W@W. COD 4 weapons were much more accurate given the era but the weapons in W@W require much more precision. That said, you'll want to duck and cover when ever you can. Leaning out from behind cover to take your shot is going to result in many more kills than running across the map while trying to get off clean shots. In short, don't be a runner-gunner. Take your time, pick your targets carefully and remeber to watch your back.    Another good strategy is to use the buddy system. This is even something the die-hard-players at cod.com recommend. I always play Team DM with a buddy. Someone to watch my back while I watch theirs. Granted, this isn't the "real thing" but you never see the US Army Infantry running out into the open or through a door all by themselves. There's always backup. Heck, even the local Police Dept. gets this concept. Going into an occupied house?... toss a tabun or flare, then send your buddy in while you follow close behind, or vice versa. Even if one of you gets taken down, the other should get the kill. And if not, you both at least know where to go to finish the guy off who did take you out. When sniping, plant some bettys, and have your buddy watch your back. When you're low on ammo, switch positions and watch his back. This strategy often results in 30+ kill games for me.    One poster mentioned "not being predictable". This is a good point but needs some elaboration. Players like myself who know the maps fairly well and have been playing since the game launched will know what you're going to do before you do it... 7 times out of 10 or so. Most every map has paths which the majority of players ALWAYS follow. On Castle, for example, in nearly every match I've played, both teams make mad breaks for the house on top the with the wooden staircase leading to the 2nd floor. You know the one with all the paper walls...? Since most players know that most other players, especially newer players, will go for that room, we simply hang back a few seconds, then hammer the room with grenades to score an easy 6 or 7 kills right out of the box. Other maps are handled the same way by most. On Roundhouse there's always some idiot on the catwalk sniping just like there's always some one on top of the coal car by the staircase. Likewise, on Makin, snipers always head for the corner of the canal on the back of the map or the tower on the front of the map. Super easy kills and if the guy is really new, he'll usually go to the same place, or at least follow the same path after every respawn.    Next, be sneaky!!! Seriously. When you're walking into a structure with a wooden floor, crouch so you're not heard. Like myself, many have very capable surround sound systems attached to their consoles and if I'm in one of those structures, I'll surely hear you before you hear me if you're not crouching. Same strategy applies on maps with high grass or other types of chest-high cover. Crouching will keep your profile low and you won't stand out so easily. I often sit on one side of a map and pick off enemies who are standing up behind a crate, vehicle, etc. All they have to do is crouch and I would never see them. So...be sneaky!    Lastly, choose your classes well. Don't play the role of a sniper if you can't take a steady shot. Likewise, don't use a bolt action rifle if you're on a small/fast map. The time it takes you to load the chamber is all the time needed for the enemy to pop you. And use your perks to your advantage. Sniping...?...use bouncing bettys to protect unmaned entrances to structures or reachable windows. Playing on a map with tanks, use the Bazooka perk so you can help your team take down those ARMY-KILLIN' tanks. Playing on a map with lots of open space, use an advanced scope so you can take long-range shots and still be accurate. Driving a tank? Make sure you equip the right perk for the job so you can either reload faster or drive faster, depending on what you're most comfortable with.    These are just some of the rules I follow when I play. I'm by no means a great player but I hold my own and have never finished below 3rd in online matches.    Oh...and if you want to score points a little faster, stay away from Team Deathmatch. Play some headquarters or other objective based games to accumulate points in record fast time. With 5 points coming your way for every one of your kills and your team members' kills, you'll pile on the points and unlock the perks super-fast.    Hope all this helped!

Na vers?o japonesa de Donkey Kong, o personagem n?o tinha um nome - Mario recebeu esse nome porque o gerente de depsito da Nintendo em Nova Iorque, Mario Segali, era parecido com o personagem.

AA10185097	They're both really fun systems, but I'd have to recommend the PS3 over the X360 because the x360s seem to break down after about a year. I know this from experience. The 360 does have a lot more games, but it's pretty unreliable.    I got a 360 and a PS3 around the same time. My playstation 3 has never had any problems, but the 360 has been nothing but problems. I've been through two of them actually.    My first x360 died almost a year after I got it. Microsoft repaired it for free because it came with a 1 year warranty, but I had to mail it to them and it took a couple of weeks for them to fix it. After I got it back it lasted another couple of months and then died again.     After the second time my 360 died, I bought a new one since the first one wasn't under warranty anymore. I was really careful with the second one. I would only play for an hour at a time and then give it 20 min to cool down because I heard they die because they over heat, but the new one only lasted about 8 months (even less time than the first). It's at microsoft getting repaired right now. When I get it back, I'm selling it before it dies again and I'm never buying another one.|`|JjKUpJ6naa	360 is better i think, it has more games and many more people buy it so you always find everybody on Xbox Live!! PS3 i think will be more popular in next years, It use BluRay that is not popular so much and has less games than Xbox 360 ...|`|6wSmZrrsaa	360|`|MuRS4lo6aa	xbox 360 cus it has verry good graphics and also you get a dashboard. if you realy are going to get an x box go to:    http://xbox360.com    it should come up with everything you need|`|wNbep2ziaa	360 is better in my opinion.  Most people i talk to agree the 360 is better, but there's arguments for both sides.  360 is cheaper to :D|`|AA11786282	I always said PS3 sucked until I got one. There are goods to both. And of course 360 has more games all you idiots its been out for way longer. PS3 has some good exclusives and 360 has some good exclusives. IMO I would say PS3 because almost all games for 360 can be bought for vista, but not vise versa. Blu Ray is slowly becoming the new standard also. They said by the end of the year they are going to start fading out DVDs and they will be gone in 2010 just like VHS is now gone (as far as new releases go) So its good to go ahead and "be prepared for the future". I REALLY think you should get a PS3 over 360 but there are going to be "fanboys" on each side. So, just look into it and see what you think. But as Iv'e stated before I would go for the PS3.|`|a8eb523f1f34be04fb9b4d5c65f11847aa	360
RnhAWXHzaa	Don't make a clan name too long or else you will have trouble making names on your Tag, speaking of you didn't state whether this is PC or console. 2 words is a good limit, MoF6 is kind of long for a tag name (unless your playing COD) but Az or DoW has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  Also, Dogs of war sounds pretty cool. I like DoO and zero too.|`|h9aNv6PDaa	Crimson Masquerade

3qXV7VHPaa	As far as i know, you can't. I remember one time one of my EP wasn't showing anymore and when i've tried to play the game it said something like "looks you have uninstalled x EP, if you continue you will loose your lots/families/objects(?) " so i've clicked on quit and (re)installed that EP.But it isn't available for all of them for instance OFB ,if you uninstall, all  OFB objects disappear but not your lots/families(but don't take that for granted).

vbsNdIluaa	Well that really depends on the type of game. Role play games such as fallout 3 will have much more game play than a FPS such as Call of Duty.|`|7SIgFY1Faa	Yes it depends on the type of game. Online games are always going to be different because you don't always play with the same people.    RPGs can last over 100 hours (e.g. Final Fantasy) whereas action games tend to last about 10 hours. Personally I like games that last at least a good 20 hours but a game that has 10 fantastic hours (MGS4) will do for me too.|`|ckX5mGagaa	All games are infinite if they have online multiplayer.    Games like fallout 3 are limited, but they are always releasing new expansions to make your play-time longer!|`|xVMQx7dtaa	It depends on the type of game!    EG:  Fifa 09 can be unlimited but a game like resistance 2 shold give anywhere between 5-15 but a game like oblivion could be up to 50+|`|4NjkuKllaa	On average, taking into account all types of games on the new consoles, i'd say 15-20 hours to make it a decent, worthwhile game|`|iyVPXl9Waa	Far Cry 2 you will prob be grey b4 you finish that baby, i know as im in the middle of it and its longgggggggggggggggggggggggg for a FPS shooter but great game i must say..

ckX5mGagaa	The xbox 360 cannot connect to the internet wirelessly.    Your xbox should've come with a free ethernet cable. Connect one end of it to your 360, and the other to your router.  If it didn't come with one, you can buy them at the dollar store.    Now turn on your xbox, and test your connection for the first time! You should connect to xbox live!|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	The way that my friends connect to xbox live is that they have an ethernet cable connected to the 360 and their computer that has internet. There might be a way to use a wireless router, but i don't know how to go about doing that.|`|OYGPaNHvaa	It is exactly like your computer, plug in an Ethernet cord (like a bigger phone cord) to the back of your xbox, and run it to your router, or modem. If you are on wireless, then you might want to look into an 80 dollar wireless attachment for the xbox.|`|D20NAiRTaa	All of those solutions are ok, BUT this is the real solution:    First off you need to have the internet conntected. (Common Sense)    Then you need to have a Xbox360 wireless network adapter to put onto your Xbox360.    Here is the link:    http://www.play.com/Games/Xbox360/4-/719...    You can either connect up wirelessly or thorugh an ethernet cable.    You then need to buy Xbox Live.    Here is the link:    http://www.play.com/Games/Xbox360/4-/860...    You should now be able to connect to the internet.    I hope this is the best answer.     Thanks alot and glad to be of help.
WuhIoS1laa	When you say "memory" are you talking actual memory (RAM) or do you mean hard disk space (which is not memory)?    I agree that you should organize your downloads folder.  I tend to do this along the lines of how the in-game catalog is organized. Ultimately, organized for you may not make sense to someone else, and you might find my method weird.     I have four folders: Build, Buy, Body Shop, Defaults    Under build are folders like Walls, Floors, Fences, Doors, Windows and Misc.     Buy mode folders are Bath, Kitchen, Lighting, Garden, Furniture.    Body Shop contains Genetics/Eyes, Genetics/Hair, Clothing (and various categories of that), and Makeup.    Nothing in defaults, but the default replacement eyes, skin, hair and so forth.     I guess I'm not understanding the movement of subfolders to your desktop when you need them and so forth, or what it buys you. They still take up space in your hard drive, just in another location. Unless you are saying that your Desktop and Documents folders reside in different places on your hard drive.     If you didn't ever change the properties of your My Documents folder and use the wizard to move those files to another hard drive, then the answer is no - they are on the same hard disk taking up the same amount of space.    If you mean custom content loaded in memory, then you'd have to keep track of what item was in use in what house/lot/sim, and remember to put the folder back in the Downloads directory before playing a lot that might use the stuff you took out before.  Otherwise, you might see blue flashing things, default game objects, or funny missing things when you didn't expect it.     That sounds like way too much work!|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Yes, it's a very good idea and one which I often recommend people do.   I recommend that people do this no matter how new or powerful their computer is.  Oh, and my computer is now about 5 years old and it plays my games well.  Much better than many people's "brand new" laptops.  It doesn't matter how old the computer is, it only matters what is inside and whether the stuff in the computer will actually work with the sims 2 games.    I like to download items which are not just hair and clothing, so my downloads folder is probably set up a bit differently than yours.    For hair and clothing though, I have a subfolder called Hair.  Within this subfolder I have Male and Female.    For clothing, I have one called Clothes.  Within that is Male and Female.  Within those, I have it broken into age groups -- Elder, Adult, Young Adult, Teen, Child, Toddler.    Then, within those I have it further broken into the game categories -- Everyday/Formal/Underwear/Swimsuits/Athl...    But that's just an example.  You can do it anyway you want.  Keep in mind though that if you have any sim wearing clothing that is in a category which you end up pulling back out of the Downloads folder, the next time you see that sim they could be wearing some hideous Maxis outfit instead.  :-D|`|5ae78c43139db27c6f3f486f9941164eaa	Yes, I think that this is a good idea. But no, I do not know how to go about doing it. Sorry, but im not used to dealing with old computers like yours.
ln1o6rXvaa	yes you can without paying put the songs from rock band 1 to 2|`|ckX5mGagaa	Go to Gamestop/EBgames, and buy rok band 1, and also ask to buy a lisence to download it to your hard drive.    I think they give you a code or something, but you enter it and then you can use all the rok band songs in rok band 2!    But you have to buy it when you buy rok band, becaue if you rent it and do it you will be accused of stealing :(

The other guys eplained software, but if your havenig trouble it a head-set then here:    If it has one small jack, then you need to buy a cheap splitter from cuircit city or something. If it has 2 jacks (1 mic, 1 headphone) then just plug it into the back of your computer!|`|2iXOaVQoaa	Like Teamspeak, Ventrilo and Skype? Yes, you can.

HPvpldkXaa	You can distribute your creations through the 'Prize Bubbles' and the reward system on the 'Score Board.'  --------------------------------------...  First off, some items need to be unlocked by finishing tutorials, you might be able to skip them, but I personally chose to complete them.  So, you may not have the scoreboard or prize bubbles yet. But you can check for them under the popit menu and then on the third page of your tool bag.  --------------------------------------...  1. Open your popit menu and select the 'tool bag' on the bottom left  2. Move to the third page and select the 'prize bubble' which is found on the top under 'Basic Kit'  3. Place the prize bubble where it can still be accessed by the popit cursor  4. With the popit cursor, which can be found on the top left of the popit menu, and highlight the bubble and press square.  5. A new menu should apear. from here you can add your creation in the empty slot under 'Contents'. Leave the shareable thing as a check if you want others to freely use it as their own.  --------------------------------------...  Now for the score board:  1. place the scoreboard wherever you want the level to end. The Scoreboard can be found in the toolbag, under Basic Kit on the third page    2. press square. Now place the desired content in the empty slots.  --------------------------------------...  If you are still having issues when forging your levels refer to the tutorials. highlight the tool/item/sticker or whatever your being troubled with and press square and in the new window select 'tutorial.'  -------  You can access other game specific tutorials from the start menu, second from the bottom. Its called "Videos and Voice Overs."  --------------------------------------...  Let me know when you finish your level :)|`|tvu4t7t8aa	what little big planet?

mtOtD8EFaa	5th June 2009. This is the date stated by the OFFICIAL website for 'Sims 3' which I have listed below.|`|2f47a7fb887504f90dec5b605dd5f63baa	June 2: http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsIt...|`|7CsQzSGLaa	August 20, 2008 - Many PC gamers have been eagerly awaiting The Sims 3, the upcoming title from Maxis and Electronic Arts. For a while now, it's been known that the game would be released in the first quarter of 2009, but no specifics were known outside of that. At the German Games Convention in Leipzig, EA announced at their press conference that the game will ship on February 20 of next year. What's more, the title will also be available as a digital download on the same day that it is released to retail.
yJ3GpnXAaa	They're doing it to try and get round the Habbo rules.    On the Habbo site it says:  **You may not give away, sell or trade your Habbo account or seek to sell virtual items from Habbo for cash**    So, instead of selling the rooms/furniture (which isn't allowed), they are selling you a joke and giving you the room/furniture as a 'free gift'.    Before you even think about buying the joke, think hard about what will happen if you're found to have bought the furni.  It isn't allowed and you can end up in trouble, as well as the seller.
2OoSK35xaa	it depends on them, its the same way with the PS2, PS3 as well.  They determine what is easier for them.  Keep your memory stick and write them, they will send you a box to send it to them and fix it.

Either that or something is up with your connection in some way or another, i'm not sure how exactly though.

qLcZZEwRaa	i really want the updates   to so i can be spurs with Jermaine defore and Robbie Keane but im not sure how you get it updated.
K2h6M1xqaa	There are several ways to go about it. . .    Look up, "Rocks & minerals" or "Gems & Minerals" in the yellow pages for your area.  Most cities have at least one specialty shop which deals in rare shiny things dug out of the ground.  Sometimes there will be rock collector conventions.  Try hunting around on line; those places are super-cool if you're into gems.  --Private collectors and guys who trudge around in the dirt with picks and shovels will bring their treasure troves to a hockey rink in a flea-market kind of way to sell their stuff once or twice a year.  It's pretty awesome actually that such things happen.  You'll be walking around and suddenly realize you're in the middle of a fantasy novel but failed to notice because it happens to be taking place in a hockey arena.    You can also look for the local New Age shop in your area.  Usually, they have a selection of crystals, though the good ones are really $$$.    Museum gift shops generally have a selection of gemstones, and you can sometimes get a really nice one for not very much; science people value gems in different ways.  --I remember once, I bought a little bag of assorted gemstones for a couple of bucks.    Or you can always order packages of stones on-line.  --A friend of mine got into jewelry making to sell.  For a very reasonable rate, you can pick out whole selections of stones of all different sorts and qualities and have them shipped to you.  She had a lot of fun with that.    My own little bit of advice with crystals. . .  Clarity counts.  Internal cracks and flaws make them weaker.  --Most crystals will hold on to the energy patterns of everybody who touches them.  Unless you know somebody who can clear the stone, you're going to get a polluted rock.    Cheers!

It's for sale at Droknar's Forge, Granite Citadel, and Fissure of Woe (different sets of looks in each, and vastly different prices).    Unless you are planning on going Beastmastery or a pure damage archer build, you'll want the +1 stat boost on your mask to be Expertise.    And typically, the bonus on your armor should be the +Energy one. The only other one I see being of any real use would be + Frost AL, and that's only if you are going to do a tanking setup with Greater Conflagration + Winter + one of the Mesmer stances that increases elemental defenses.|`|ee569f9fc53b911e3456517551d307fdaa	Any 70AL armor.

zRgmJrVpaa	Alright heres what you do...     Make a list of the games bring the list to school/work ask people if they wanna buy any. But dont sell them for to much, and don't get cought.    P.S. Only sell to friends and try to keep on the down low, people will want to rip you off.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	they rip you off but that's how they make there money i suggest you buy an edge card and you get 10% for what you sell them and pay 10% less when you buy a used game it's only like 2 bucks and they send you magazines with all the new games technology and information|`|VWO9tW5eaa	not a lot cuzz they rip you off. trade them with friends|`|AZhh3af7aa	Call them and ask. If they aren't willing to answer then call a different Gamestop until you get someone who is. I've gotten quotes over the phone before and had to do this same thing.
OnFp4LIUaa	SOGEN:  The Standard is Sogen, a simple Field Spell that boosts the ATK and DEF of Warriors and Beast-Warriors by 200. You can get copies of Sogen from the Legend of Blue-Eyes White Dragon Boosters and the Kaiba Starter Deck.    GAIA POWER:  This might not be that useful, but many Warriors are EARTH Attribute, and Gaia Power boosts EARTH Attribute Monsters's ATK by 500 but Decreases their DEF by 400. If you're deck focuses on Defense then this isn't for you. Likewise, If you like this effect but your Warrior's aren't EARTH Attribute then there is one of these Field Spells for each Attribute.. You can obtain copies of Gaia Power, and the following Attribute Field Spells from the Spell Ruler Boosters and the Dark Beginning 1 Boosters.    DARK: Mystic Plasma Zone  LIGHT: Luminous Spark  WATER: Umiiruka  FIRE: Molten Destruction  WIND: Rising Air Current    SKYSCRAPER and SKYSCRAPER 2 - HERO CITY:  Something Else I Thought might be useful to you if your Warriors are Elemental Heroes are the Skyscraper Field Spells. Skyscraper comes in Cybernetic Revolution, Dark Revelation 4, and Duelist Pack: Jaden Yuki, and increases the ATK of your attacking Elemental Heroes by 1000. The Second Skyscaper: Skyscaper 2 - Hero City, lets you Special Summon an Elemental Hero once per turn from your Graveyard that was Destroyed by Battle. Plus - Most Field Spell Cards help your Opponent too.. This one's only for you!    Hope These Help You..|`|AA11442085	Sogen( http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/Sogen ) increases the ATK and DEF of Warriors by 200. The bonus is so little that it might be better to use The A.Forces( http://yugioh.wikia.com/wiki/The_A._Forc... ) instead.
zkscW8seaa	There is a Zero Suit Samus trophy, all you need to do is play as Zero Suit Samus through Classic Mode from the start. In order to play as Zero Suit Samus from the start however, all you need to do [on the Gamecube controller] is hold L and R while pressing Start to begin Classic Mode. When the first round begins, you will be Zero Suit Samus. Note that if Smash Balls appear, at least try to ignore them, considering you'll change back to Samus and not get the Zero Suit Samus trophy.|`|JS811Z4waa	you get it by beating classic mode as Zero Suit Samus. hold Z while selecting samus to get Zero suit samus play through Classic and win|`|ljTbR031aa	yes|`|1vHMkYwGaa	Yes there is i think it is up B or something like that|`|c05f7b5ac9dac7b4fd66be18be24349faa	yes there is.

mHWsuqjZaa	no not really. besides you have banned cards in your deck such as chaos emperor dragon, black luster soldier, last will, change of heart, and pot of greed. When you take those out it makes this deck even worse, i do not even know what your theme is for this deck. It's just kind of random. sorry to tell you but you would get killed by teleDAD, lightsworn, or zombies.|`|Hz0uAFl5aa	if you an organise that list into Magic Traps and Spells, I might be able to help.

But original cards have a shiny square on the lower right hand corner. usually fake cards have konami spelled wrong on the back, the are a ot lighter in color and the cards are a lot thicker.|`|07r3ldrSaa	There's a little holographic part on one of the bottom corners of the card.|`|mYKPFypraa	Theres a shiny spot on the bottom of the card, and the fakes are lighter on the back.|`|R2DXBNnjaa	Original Cards have a special smell which cant be found on fake cards, try sniffing them. Although its stupid , but its true.
oXFMmf0iaa	If ou haven't been doing this already, go to Jubilife City and go in the Poketch building. Talk to the manager (in a purple shirt next to the counter) and he will give you Poketch apps depending on how many badges you have got. I'm guessing you've got 7 as opposed to 8, so you should be able to get it. Keep talking to him until he gives you the marking map. This will allow you to track moving pokemon.     Now that you have the marking map, fly to Sangem Town and have some quick balls (can be baught at Pastoria City), some ultra balls and (depending on when you do this) dusk balls. Now it is possible to catch Mesprit in a pokeball but considering how long it takes i wouldn't if i were you ( i myself have done it). You also need a pokemon with surf and some max repels. Put the marking map on your screen and you should see a little icon (mesprit).     Get on you bike and ride between route 219 and sangem town, always watching the marking map. When youi see the icon getting nearer where you are, keep doing it. When you see the icon in the same section as you (should be sangem's beach/route 219) then go down to the sea and surf very close to the land. DO NOT go any further than 5 equivilent steps in the sea outwards. This will take you too far and into another route. Use a max repel and surf around in the designated area and hope for the best. I can't really explain it that well by typing so watch the video below.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ee1-2AU0k...|`|6OgkoKB7aa	when you will go to catch mesprite it will run away.you can follow it by watching mesprite in the poketch.but if you will fly and go to catch mesprite it will change its position.so just be patient and walk in the grass and mesprite can appear.|`|95009345a8832135fef8002fec62e6c1aa	Sorry...but you are going to be chasing Mesprit around for a while because it is a traveling pokemon.  Go to the Poketch Building and talk to the president to get the poketech app that will help you track it.  The building is in Jubilife City...if memory serves me correctly.  Make sure that you have pokemon that knows Mean Look at the top.  And make sure that it is the same level that Mesprite is or a little higher.  Carry a lot of Ultra Balls.  You will probably not catch it on the first few tries but you can chip away at Mesprit's HP until it is low enough to catch.  If you switch the pokemon out that knows Mean Look, Mesprit will flee.  Since you have no idea when Mesprit will show up you can't save before going after it so be very careful not to faint it.  Otherwise you won't be able to catch it.  This is the same for Cresselia - another traveling pokemon.
Z0I5Qvk7aa	Bethesda has said they intend to make more than one Fallout game which is why they acquired the license from Interplay. They are going to focus on the next Elder Scrolls game, but I assume after the next Elder Scrolls, Fallout 4 will start production. I'd say it will be at least another 3 or 4 years until we see Fallout 4, unless Bethesda splits into two teams, one focusing on the Fallout series, and the other on The Elder Scrolls series.

2728dfb022c14792863b78aafcfd0d23aa	Here are the minimum requirements for RE4.  So, yes, you can run it.  I would recommend shutting off the games high graphics settings, though.  Your card can handle it, but you're going to be bumping up against the upper limits of your card.  So, tone down the in-game graphics settings to make it run better.

d5928aef823e729cbef56cb2408fdda4aa	Yes, the first offical DLC was announced today. It's a cover story at IGN.com if you want to check it out.      Looks like a few new campaigns and the like. Didn't mention anything about new weapons/characters.|`|qgRibLytaa	yeahh hah.  there is one  and its on that  website they said below(:|`|91de20c91e1b0ea1a6448022652ff606aa	yes announced over at IGN.com should be some new campaigns for online, or co-op play, maybe more stuff who knows, should be sweet tho

kthrNyAdaa	well it depends on the style of player you are.    if you like to be in the face of an enemy you could try:    Warrior, Paladin, Druid (feral specialization), Death Knight (but you cant have one until level 55) Shaman (Enhancement)    if you like to stand back and cast magic you can try    Mage, Druid (Balance), Priest (Shadow), Shaman (Elemental)    if you like to stand back and keep everyone healed look at    Priest (Holy), Druid (Restoration), Shaman (restoration)    if you like to have a pet or minion take aggro for you:    Hunter, or Warlock.      you have to try out a few things if you dont know your playing style.  i have been playing games for a long time so i already knew that i liked being a caster.  so i chose a Night Elf Druid.    you will have to choose Alliance or Horde.  there is lots of arguement about which one is better and easier to play.  Blizzard really has designed it to be equal.  some just dont see that.    with a server choice, if you dont have any friends on one. i would try to choose and older realm, they have more players who have usually been playing a lot longer, which might be more helpful but that just my opinion.  if i were you i would not go pvp as a inexperienced player.  the reason behind that is because after you get to level 20 and start questing in contested territory, which in turn leads to you getting killed in the middle of your questing.    I play on Lightbringer.    my main is Clamor - Night Elf Druid lvl 80.    if you need anymore help dont hesistate to message me|`|9y1uYUm3aa	hunter/night elf/bolderfist|`|e9VM5SjRaa	Well this depends what kind of person you are if you are a support tipe of person i would sugest resto shaman if you are a damage dealing maniac and i mean that in a good sense :) the highest dps classes are hunters warlocks and mages, if your looking for pvp and bringing pwnage to a lot players i suggest a rogue as for races its really irelevant atm the difference is to small to spot,but i would tell you to chose a race you like as in you wont hate youreself for loging on such an ugly char :) Gl with that hope you find what you want   I played: 80 rogue               80 paladin               70 shaman                70warlock               70warrior              68hunter  Currently quit i hope i dont give in. :)  And btw if your just starting wow i would recomend this www.wow-levelingguide.Co.CC as a starting site, there are many features that will help you.|`|FH2rD2aUaa	hunter/night elf/bolderfist  the best pvp relm and its fun because there are so many people to play with and hunters are a good class to start with because there balanced out and u get to cghosse ur pet u want its a really fun class|`|gKgboHCaaa	When i played i was an undead mage becuase i didnt like being hit,but undeed are pretty much equally good in all things. i did pvp wrld to       P.S. its really your choice if youd rather have hoard or alliance

wyvSAhtZaa	A well-known amusement park company, Amusement Today, has ranked Superman Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England the  1 roller coaster in the world. Millennium Force at Cedar Point was at one time ranked best in the world, but now it comes in at  2.    My favorite would be Magnum XL-200 at Cedar Point. It also happens to be in the Top 10 best roller coasters in the world.    Kingda Ka and Top Thrill Dragster are among the best in the world, but they're just all about height and speed.|`|QuktVKL2aa	Kingda Ka. 456ft, 420ft drop, 128mph launch, you launch up to a 90-degree angle, twist to the left, then drop down 90-degrees with a 270-degree twist(not very sure) then travels up to a 130-foot hill and all done|`|4Na1Xc3Gaa	the john mccain  its at a nursing home in arizona|`|BovQKmBuaa	anaconda---kings dominion, virginia|`|gUS2LnzBaa	It has to be Millennium force, it is 310 ft tall which at the time it was built it was the tallest.|`|gaEspFcSaa	i woudl have to say millenium force at cedar point in sandusky ohio|`|x1ynqzniaa	Total at Ceder Point in Ohio.

That's why it takes a team of hundreds of people to complete a game in 1, 2 or 3 years. If you are really serious and dedicated about it you should look into C++ programming. Good luck!
nN9y3BtTaa	no they cant do that there  thats why it is called downloadable content

Actually, that chick below me is correct, however - once you do this, it kinda screws up your family - at least it did for me. They lose ALL their friends and lovers, as if they never even met... so if that's a big deal to you then don't do it.    Ok well now she's wrong. It DOES! It even makes sense - if you move your family to a completely new neighborhood - leaving behind the friends/lovers, how can they still be acquainted with one another? Yeah, exactly. This is the only thing that goes whack and like i said before, if it's a big deal to you - don't do it because ALL your friends/lovers will no longer be associated with the family you move (other than the ones living in the household you're moving)

I've been using a verizon headset for a long time and it's way better than the wired ones from Microsoft.|`|7OR2Pawzaa	if its got a mic than yaaa probably|`|SY3aYLMraa	It won't work.  They were designed to only be compatible with a 360 headset, due to the volume control and muting being on the headset as well.  Also, the jack is for a power supply.  If you are going to try it anyway, get the cheapest stuff you can for when you realise it doesn't work.

It was slow, moves were tough to pull off.  Whose the genius that says you have to input the buttons before you can do the trick?  With SSX, you did the tricks as you push the buttons.  With Dark Summer, you had to enter up, down, down, x, b, and then it does the trick.  Just game.    I also played E.T. and Dark Summit was even worse than E.T.|`|3vWpUXsmaa	Haunting Ground for PS2.

mmzWHE2maa	first of all you must have the game in one compressed folder (.iso type).  -if you don't know what is (.iso):  it is called "cd image" and it means that the cd or dvd was ripped as it is.    second, you must have image burner or just dvd burner program with image burning feature.    third, just burn the image file (usually .iso) into a cd or dvd.  when you finish burning the cd, then it is just like the company cd.    --the program for image burning called "ImgBurn" that i use for even burning PS2 games.    i may have drifted out of the question, but this is the only way to make the game "pops up".  hope that helped|`|8G3T0JJVaa	first you need software to disable the copyright stuff on the cd (slyfox, alchohol 120% etc)  then insert the cd into the drive and a blank cd into the second dvd drive  the software should automaticly disable the copyright protection (which usually doesnt let you burn commercial dvds/cds)  then using windows media player burn the contents of the cd to the blank cd

AA11850311	http://modthesims2.com  All content is free, and there are new items daily.  Everything there is scanned to be virus and hack free, unless of course it specifically states that it is a game hack or mod.  It is the only site I trust 100%  When you set up your account, you can have the site show you only items that are compatible with your configuration of expansion packs.  If you download and install the custom content correctly 99%+ of the items there will work.  The basics are as follows  Only get items that are compatible with your games.  If the item requires Pets, but you don't have Pets, don't get it!  It can seriously mess up your game at worst, or at best, just not show up in-game.  Custom Content must be placed in the correct folder    My Documents / EA Games / Sims2 / Downloads      Putting CC in your Program Files or on your desktop will not work.  Custom content must be extracted.  Putting .zip or .rar files in the Downloads folder will not work, you must un-compress those files.  Most files when uncompressed will be .package files, but sometimes they will be Sims2Pack files.  Sims2Pack files will have a round blue icon with a person or house in the middle.  These are most often complete sims, or lots.  You must double click on the blue icon to get those files to install.  Sometimes custom content requires a separate file called a mesh to be downloaded as well.  Creators should make a note of that, and provide a link.  (Custom content showing up as the same default clothing or hair style often means you did not get the required mesh)  The guide below has more complete instructions on installing custom content.  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...  Additionally, be extremely careful about getting anything from the Exchange on the official Sims2.ea.com website. The objects there are fine, as they are made by Maxis, but I would not trust any of the sims, and certainly not the houses. Anyone can upload anything and they are not checked for hacks. You could easily download something that you don't know about or want, and it could really mess with your game.    [EDIT] that error looks like Vista security, the most annoying, useless software feature I've ever seen.  What kind of program did you download?  Other than the patch from thesims2.ea.com you should not have had to download anything to get Sims2 to play on Vista.

If you look up chess as it was in ancient Persia or India, you will find VERY different names and how the pieces move.

AA11850311	Sims2 Double Deluxe has Sims2, Nightlife, and Celebration Stuff all together on one DVD disk.  If you buy Sims2 Double Deluxe, you'll be ready to play.  I have Sims2 Deluxe, Open for Business, and FreeTime, and I love them all!  Double Deluxe is only $20 right now, so that's a good price.  Sims3 was supposed to be out Feb. 19, but they just moved the release date to June 2.  It's hard to describe Sims2 and actually make it sound as fun as it really is.  It's a lot like an electronic dollhouse.  You get to build lots of houses and put them all together in neighborhoods.  You can make families to live in those houses.  The sims age, so if you start with one as a toddler, they will grow up into an adult, and then they can get married and have kids of their own.  You may want to watch some videos on youtube to see if you might like Sims2.    Here is how to find out what is in your computer  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    This is what should be in your computer to play Sims2 (Celebration Stuff is listed as SP4)  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    and here is the best site to get custom content.

J5KpCgeEaa	I have a PS3 and I love it.  The graphics are great and you can also use it as a blu ray disc player.  Also, you can go online wireless and play against your friends or anybody in the world.|`|1hNrgfMCaa	They both are great system's. However the PS3 has the best hardware inside of it. The cell broadband engine is the processor of the future, with 8 cores. Compared to the dual core processor that are in most of the computers today. The Blu-ray discs that the PS3 have are 5x as big as the dvd-rom discs that the xbox 360 uses, this means bigger world's, more enemy's to fight. Mainly alot more possibility of what can be done in a video game. The multiplayer is alot bigger on the PS3. xboxlive may have been the better of the two as far as network. Playstation HOME is getting bigger and better each day, with a 3D world to interact with.|`|8tB8wqGcaa	Xbox 360 if you want more games and to go on xbox live.  PS3 if you want blu-ray disc players and better graphics|`|PKULDaC7aa	I prefer the 360 because in my opinion it has a much better library of games. Some people will say the PS3 has much better graphics and some games that may be true but for most the graphics are very similar. Also, XBox Live is far superior to the PS3 online from my experience with them so if online is in the picture for you I would definitely go with the 360. One of the best things about the PS3 though is that it also plays blu-ray but since you can buy a stand-alone pretty cheap thats not really a huge selling point. Hope this helps.|`|CiKiWvZEaa	Look at it this way Xbox= more games and PS3=free internet they both have there share of problems I got a Xbox because Im a fan of Halo and all the good titles that came out for it like left 4 dead, gears of war 1 & 2, and mass effect.|`|BGL2qhv8aa	If i was you i would buy a PS3. It may be a little more expensive but its worth it.     PS3 has:  CPU with 8 cores.  Reality Synthesizer GPU (550MHz)  PS3 looks nicer. (My Opinion)  Blu-Ray ROM holds 50GB on every disc. Runs way faster.  Up to 7 wireless controllers.  15 mins charge lasts 30 hours.  75 foot wireless range.  Six-Axis  6 USB ports.  Camera Memory Card Readers.  Free Internet.

Yeah, it's a little more expensive, but it's better overall. I have both a 360 and a PS3, so my answer isn't biased. It's just that between the 360 and the PS3, the PS3 doesn't suffer from as much slowdown as the 360 does. Especially when the 360 is trying to play regular xbox games. Also, there's a lot less of a chance that your PS3 will stop working, as well. 360's Red ring of death is becoming far too common these days.     Not to mention that the PS3 has a built in blu-ray player, a spot for a HDMI cable, bluetooth support, and a free online network. You don't have to pay just to play your games online. Overall, I enjoy my PS3 more than I do my 360. It's more reliable than my 360 has been. Less freezing, less odd noise problems, just more reliable overall.

Because every summer, thousands of people ride that roller coaster and nothing bad happens to them.     So go to Canobie Lake Park this summer, ride the Corkscrew and have a GREAT time!!
KCAeFaEkaa	u have slow internet and its a big game|`|l4TvcMs7aa	Its a really big file. You could also have slow internet. Once i had to wait 12 hours for a demo to download.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	For starters, it's a 1.40 GB download. That's a LOT of data.  Secondly, a lot of people are downloading it right now because it was just released this morning. A crowded server means slower download times.  Thirdly, your internet connection might not be so great. If that's the case, you're download time will take even longer.|`|FPsMtmThaa	This morning mine took less than 30 min.. yours is taking long because there are probably 10 times more people downloading it at the same time.  It's just traffic man.. the more people DLing at the same time, the slower it will DL for you.  Remember, it IS Halo.|`|aTS9NoTNaa	Probably because lots of people are trying to download it at once which puts a lot of strain on the servers.|`|5DotQaQfaa	If a lot of other people where downloading it at the same time, the download time was slowed down thanks to that. Also, the speed of your internet connection and the demo's file size are to be considered in why it took a long time for the demo to be loaded to the computer. Finally, if the website's server has low-running speed, even if your internet connection runs at a fast pace, the download will still take a while.
AA11681100	I'm going to assume from your name that you have the 360 version...    And this just happens randomly in the game, unfortunately. It happens with Elder Scrolls: Oblivion as well. Both games are made by the same company, and run on the same engines. So there is not patch for it. It's just a fault in the programming that occurs from time to time. But fortunately it is kind of rare. (Though it seems to happen more in fallout 3 than it did in oblivion) Just don't forget to save as often as you can. There's nothing worse than playing for a few hours and getting up there on the main storyline only to freeze in a random spot and realize you forgot to save.|`|3erMfuhaaa	Well maybe you will benefit from this information.  The melting point of a solid is the temperature range at which it changes state from solid to liquid. At the melting point the solid and liquid phase exist in equilibrium. When considered as the temperature of the reverse change from liquid to solid, it is referred to as the freezing point. Because of the ability of some substances to supercool, the freezing point is not considered to be a characteristic property of a substance.  For most substances, melting and freezing points are approximately equal. For example, the melting point and freezing point of the element mercury is 234.32 kelvin (?38.83 C or ?37.89 F). However, certain substances possess differing solid-liquid transition temperatures. For example, agar melts at 85 C (185 F) and solidifies from 31 C to 40 C (89.6 F to 104 F); this process is known as hysteresis.    Certain materials, such as glass, may harden without crystallizing; these are called amorphous solids. Amorphous materials as well as some polymers do not have a true melting point as there is no abrupt phase change at any specific temperature. Instead, there is a gradual change in their viscoelastic properties over a range of temperatures. Such materials are characterized by a glass transition temperature which may be roughly defined as the "knee" point of the material's density vs. temperature graph.    The melting point of ice at 1 atmosphere of pressure is very close [1] to 0 C (32 F, 273.15 K), this is also known as the ice point. In the presence of nucleating substances the freezing point of water is the same as the melting point, but in the absence of nucleators water can supercool to ?42 C (?43.6 F, 231 K) before freezing.|`|KtsOtRiPaa	Hey, I have the same problem, everyone does. There are currently no patches to this. But it happens VARY RARELY. Nothing to worry about, but just make sure you save a lot. I save every time i accomplish something big or small. I am not sure why it freezes though. Make sure you get the new DLCs. Operation: Anchorage is finally out, and is sweet, even though it is very short. But at the end of this month, the next DLC called The Pitt comes out. And then at the end of March, the absolute bvest DLC comes out, it raises the level cap and extends the main story, its called Broken Steel.

IxNQwrKYaa	The board's power comes from the calling forth of spirits. The participant(s) get(s) the attention of these spirits and ask(s) them questions, whereupon the spirits respond by moving the planchette around on the board. Many people believe a person can call forth the spirit of someone who has passed on, or some other specific entity, but this has never been proven, to my knowledge. The spirit(s) who are summoned will often not have any singular identity at all.    Those spirits who do have identities will usually be vague, evasive or misleading about their names. This is because knowing their names can give the experienced summoner power over the spirits themselves, and the spirits can then be forced to do things they don't want to do. This is very undesirable to the spirits, of course, who want to keep their liberty and freedom intact.    The spirits who are summoned in this way are never good ones. Good spirits will not respond to this type of summoning. Sometimes the spirits who are summoned are neutral or mischievous, and will often simply give random answers to participants' questions.    Other spirits may be more powerful than these, and may actually have limited knowledge they may impart. However, these spirits are nearly always malevolent, and when summoned they may decide to take residence in the room or household where they are summoned. Sometimes they will even take residence in the participants themselves! Once they have taken residence, they can manifest themselves in our world of reality in real and very frightening, and in some cases very destructive, ways.    Depending on the power of these malevolent beings, one may be able to drive them out in a variety of ways. These spirits are very legalistic, however, and some of them may have the power to take up permanent residence in the room, household or person they have elected to haunt.    These spirits can only be gotten rid of by identifying the source of their right to be wherever they are, renouncing this right, and flooding the host with good spirits. They can then be forced to flee. Very powerful evil spirits may be difficult to exorcise even in this manner, but it is the only manner that has been proven to be successful.    Keep in mind that this is the way you get rid of the malevolent spirits once you have them. You cannot prevent their permanent residence by any means, whether by religious icons, garlic, holy water, or whatever, because the actual calling forth of spirits is what gives them the right to stay. The calling of the spirits will override any preventive measures you could use to prevent their permanent residence.    If you do call forth spirits to manipulate objects in the real world and divulge information, you are asking for trouble. My advice is, DON'T! No information received in this way is worth the potential risk of possession by evil spirits. Many lives have been completely destroyed in this way. Please, don't let this happen to you. If you are tempted to use divination devices to call forth spirits, get rid of them. Your life will be much better for it. - LJS|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	It is of the devil.

LMJVHOWLaa	The first company I have to recommend is Dow Chemical (DOW).  I have previously given a detailed breakdown of my take on Dow Chemical and that can be found here.  With the significant decline in the price of oil, Dow Chemical, as I suggested in my earlier post, should be doing quite well this quarter.      The second company I have to recommend is AT&T (T). The company, with its strong cash flow, healthy balance sheet and absolutely dominant market position is a perfect investment in times like these.  With the beating that it has taken over the last several months, the stock is currently trading at its lowest level since 2005, and with a dividend yield of over 6% and a P.E. of only 11 the stock is likely safer then Treasuries.    The third stock that I really like at these levels is CBS (CBS). The company will likely have significant advertising issues going forward but like my previous two recommendations, it is an absolute steal at these levels. With a P.E. in the mid single digits and a dividend yield well above 10%, its hard to believe that this company is even a blue chip, but it is.  With solid dividend coverage, ability to leverage up the balance sheet, and the ability to sell off numerous assets to enhance shareholder value its hard to see how the stock could go much lower.       The final stock that I have to recommend is the defensives stalwart Reynolds American (RAI). The stock is not nearly as leveraged up as Altria (MO) giving it increased financial flexibility when it comes to share buybacks, dividends and acquisitions.  With a P.E. of 8 and a dividend yield of 8 percent one is assured of above market returns for the foreseeable future.    By owning these names, investors will be able to own four companies with an average P.E. of 8 and a dividend yield of nearly 8%.  In addition, investors will know that they are investing in companies that make up the backbone of the economy and that provide essential services that will likely not be trimmed by consumers and businesses during a recession, even if it should be severe.|`|LPArdQtbaa	google?

It might be falling fast enough that puts will work well with it, or it might be rising.      Visa might not be green, but check it out.  V    MA is Mastercard    RIMM makes the blackberries.    LDK makes solar stuff    ESLR is Evergreen Solar - they also make solar panels.    AAPL is Apple Computer.  See if you can buy puts.  They are a risky way to make a extreme amount of money.  If the stock is falling, then puts go up in value, but don't hang on to them for a long time, they will expire worthless in a short time frame.  For puts to work, you buy them at say 3 months before expiration date, wait for the stock to fall $1, and then sell them right away.      Normally the put will have gained about $0.75 on a dollar stock loss, but stock call options will gain $.75 on a stock gain.    Of course the risk is that the put will lose value quickly if the stock rises, and the call will fall quickly in value of the stock goes down.    MMM  is 3M Corp.    I don't know how any of these stocks have done in the past 18 months.  In the fall of 2007, I had a much better idea of how they where doing, then I stopped tracking them.

You may want to sit down and use Beckett's even if they are on the high side and let the bidding start at xxxx.xx  As far as grading goes by the corners and the margin around the edge and the clarity of the card.  I got rid of all my cards in the mid 90's and the only ones that I kept were my charter membership cards in Tops Stadium Club so I really don"t know what cards are selling for.  Good Luck

There were 236 figures, a boardgame, and other games you could play with them...Most kids had a wall chart to check them off as they were collected.  These were from about 1985 -1988.|`|1umOKLqoaa	omg I know what your talking about. ummmmm omg I can't remember either. *gasp* no it's bothering me I can't remember.|`|7XGa9zcdaa	By little plastic characters do you mean miniatures?
