20090128201612AANo1f3	News & Events;Current Events	Where can I find MORE statements of GANDHI in support of the ARAB RESISTENCE against Israel?	Gandhi said in 1938:       "Palestine (which includes present-day "Israel") belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs. What is going on in Palestine today cannot be justified by any moral code of conduct.       Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home. It is wrong for the Jews to enter Palestine under the shadow of the British gun. A religious act cannot be performed with the aid of the bayonet or the bomb.       I wish the Arabs had chosen the way of non-violence in resisting what they rightly regarded as an unwarrantable encroachment upon their country. But according to the accepted canons of right and wrong, NOTHING CAN BE SAID AGAINST THE ARAB RESISTENCE IN THE FACE OF OVERWHELMING ODDS."       http://www.kamat.com/mmgandhi/mideast.ht...

20090128193002AA2DeXU	News & Events;Current Events	2009 Stimulus package passed today?	I read that it was passed, but I am alittle confused on what this means for us as individuals.     Local ews article says, "tax cut calls for a $500 break for single workers and $1,000 for couples"     What exactly does that mean? My husband and I are having a debate. He says we will be receiving checks, I said it will be a tax break over a certain amount of time. Meaning, they would not take as many taxes out of our paychecks. I assume that the $500-$1000 tax break will come into affect during tax file time. If you didn't pay in enough they will give you a $500-$1000 tax exemption, For Example; I paid in $600, but should have paid in $800. I wouldn't owe that extra $200 according to the tax cut because it falls within the $1000 allotted for my couple status.     Am I understanding right or is my husband right about us getting a refund check of $1000?

Cockpit Voice Recorder            Here is the transcript from the voice recorder from the Hudson River Crash starting after the bird strikes.             PIC is a Pilot in Command, SIC is Second in Command, you all know who Sully is.              SIC:  "Number two's gone, boss."      Sully:  "I know it!  What do I look like, an R-22 pilot (that's a baby helicopter a real egg beater)?  Just shut the f*cker down, boy.  Oh, and tell Departure that we need to come back in and land.  F*cking birds.. ."      SIC:  "Sheesh, somebody got up on the wrong side of his throne this morning.  You don't have to insult me just because I got my commercial helicopter rating in the mighty Robinson.  Oh, and by the way, sir, we're not climbing, if you even care.  Maybe your decision to take on that extra 5,000 pounds of fuel wasn't so hot, Captain."      Sully:  "One more comment like that and I'll make sure the union keeps you in RJ's for the rest of your miserable, short career."             Sully:  "SON OF A *****!"      SIC:  "Number one's failing, boss."      Sully:  "I can see that!  Am I a-f*cking-sleep?  Can I not read the gauges?  Am I not flying the plane here?"      SIC:  "I'm just sayin'..."      Sully:  "Goddamn Canadians, sending their f*cking geese down here every winter.  Why, if I ever *see* another Canadian I'm gonna punch him right in the throat.  I *HATE* Canadians."      SIC:  "Everybody does, boss.  Think we can make Teterboro or straight-in to 22 at Newark?"      Sully:  "Yeah, probably.  But f*ck Teterboro!  Let's go to Newark.  I've flown out of Teterboro.  Short damn runways...always a crosswind.  And their FBO's suck.  I'd rather land in the Hudson f*cking river than land at Teterboro.  Hey...."      SIC:  "You're not..."      Sully:  "Why not?  Maybe we can take out some sailboats with some prick Canadian snowbirds."      SIC:  "You ever land on the water before?"      Sully: "Plenty of times!  I got my seaplane rating back in 1946.  I think it was in a...Piper...somethingoranother, I forget.  Never mind.  It'll all come back to me. Pull out the Before Water Landing checklist and run it."      SIC: (flipping through the stack of checkli sts) "Can't seem to find one for that."      Sully:  "Fooled ya!  HAH!  There ain't one!  Just get on the horn and tell the people to put their heads between their legs and kiss...no wait, that won't sound good on on the CVR tape...make it, 'brace for collision'...no wait, make it 'brace for impact.'  Yeah, that's better.  No wait!  Tell them that out the left side of the plane they can see theIntrepid Museum, and that if they'd like to visit it, they'll be able to, this afternoon, like, in about twenty minutes.  Oh, and ring the stews and have them bring me a rum and coke.  If I'm gonna do this, I need a good stiff drink.  And have that one with the big **** bring it up.  If I'm gonna die, I wanna die drunk and with a *****."      SIC:  "Like your grandfather did?"      Sully:  "This is no time to make jokes, son.  I would really appreciate it if you'd try to take this situation seriously.  I'm f airly certain that my grandfather did not die with a *****.  I mean, have you ever met my grandmother?"      SIC:  "You know, if you pull this off CNN will be calling you the Hero Pilot of the Year."      Sully:  "F*ck CNN.  Liberal bastards.  All I care about is what the fair-and-balanced Fox News will call me.  I hope Fox News calls me a hero!"      SIC:  (sighing)  "They probably will too.  Nobody will remember *my* name.  It'll be 'Sully this'...and, 'Sully that.'  'Captain Sully, the big f*cking hero.'  Like you are the only f*cking one in the cockpit."      Sully:  "You're quite bitter.  You really are a helicopter pilot at heart, aren't you?  You know, some pilots wait their whole career to be called a hero.  I mean, Christ, I've only got two years to go to retirement.  That was close!"      SIC:  "We're not down yet, Captain Skygod."      Sully:  "I know, this thing gl ides pretty well, huh?  Dammit, no sailboats.  Oh well, let's see if we can buzz one of those damn sightseeing helicopters.  What's best-glide/engines out?"      SIC:  "Beats the **** outta me."      Sully:  "Vref?"      SIC:  "F*ck if I know."      Sully:  "Britney Spears' birthday?"      SIC:  "December 2, 1981."      Sully:  "Well, I'm glad you know SOMETHING!  Just gimme full flaps..."      [END OF RECORDING]

Not just for gasoline but for basic necessities like  fruits, vegetables, bread, milk, movie tickets, clothing, etc, etc, etc. Even food prices in restaurants continue to go up all the time.

The Israeli government has announced than any Israeli soldier should not fear prosecution for any actions taken during the conflict, and that they will defend against any allegation of inhumane practices or the like. There are many accounts of soldiers shooting unarmed women and children literally waving white flags, or of soldiers not allowing innocent men women and children to leave conflict zones making their deaths inevitable, or bombing highly urban areas where civilian casualties are all but guaranteed. Israel is saying this is all just and legal, and disregards any accusations to the contrary.       Forgoing any opinions or biases about weather it was right to invade or not, should the people responsible for these actions be punished and should their actions be denounced by the global community?      I ask because i have seen nothing to suggest that any of this has or will happen.
