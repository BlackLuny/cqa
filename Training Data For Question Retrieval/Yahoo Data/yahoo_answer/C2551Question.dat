I don't know a ton about cars, but i'd like to learn, i thought this might be something easy to do and from most of my searching on google it appears that most people deem this as a relatively simple task. I wasn't able to find anything on my specific model though so i wasn't sure if someone might be familiar with it.

20090221030345AAicNmX	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What lubricant to use for a sticky brake pad?	My car is scheduled in to the garage for a brake job in a few days. But on one of the 4 (back left) pad sets I think the pad is down to the back plate and is literally metal on metal (the pad back plate or screws are in contact with the rotor....which needs to be replaced along with the calliper anyways). It's only really driven highway miles, with a few stops that I can gear down for anyhow and barely use the brakes. The car still has good braking power since the other 3 sets are OK. Heating of the rotor/wheel set isn't a problem since I've checked it several times      I just want a lubricant that will minimize the grinding noise of that one particular brake set when the brakes are applied. I know that putting lubricant on the pad or rotor defeats the purpose of the brake but I just need a temporary solution.      I know I should just leave the car in the garage but I need to get to work for a few days or risk my job (and then I won't have money for the full four wheel brake job $$$)      What would be a good choice for lubricant to minimize the friction/ wear of metal on metal?

PLEASE HELP?	unfortunately i cant remember the size of the engine and its cold out and also 6 in the morning, too early to look but maybe you can help me.         my car just recently started overheating, really bad.  have a neighbor whose very well with cars and has been a mechanic his whole life so hes gonna help me with it but i would like to have an idea of what to do before we get started.         ok, the car is over heating and is getting air inside the coolant hoses, now right away i thought head gasket and a weekend of work. well i bleed the whole System for a good hour of stopping and waiting and turning the car off and cooling it down and what not, going through about 2 gallons of coolant. trying to get whatever air pocket was in it out. it didn't work. there still seems to be air getting into the engine. no white smoke comes out the exhaust and the antifreeze is still green. i also did a chemical check to see if the air inside the coolant hose was in fact containing combustible fluids or anything like that, CAME BACK NEGATIVE, so i don't think its the heads (thank god) although i checked all the hoses and fittings and everything runs great but the cooling fans will not turn on, with the heater on or air conditioning, or it being set to defrost mode. so i think there is a problem with the temp sending unit that i never noticed.      also the radiators top four bars gets warm but all the rest on the bottom are still cold? if i get all the air out and enough coolant to go through the engine Temperature drops and everything works fine for about 2 min, after that the car starts over heating again and im back to letting the air out. i just cant figure this out. im going to the junkyard tomotomorrow to get a radiator but i was hoping someone would have any info on this matter that could help me.      i figure i can try re-torquing the heads and if worse comes to worse replace the intake gasket with the head gasket. although i like to spend my weekends relaxing.       thanks       Dylan

I found a pretty nice one for $998 at a small used car lot, they said they'd take $700 cash for it. Is it a good deal? It is in overall decent shape, 166** miles, a little rust on some of the other parts.    If you have one, how does it rate for a starter bike? I learned to ride on a suzuki gz 250 and loved it. I would love to find a 250, but don't even know where to look for one. I just found a 2005 online, but its $2000 and a little out of my price bracket(up to 1400 including fees). So back to the 450... what do you think? Give me your thoughts.

The thing is I was having the brakes fixed yesterday, and I had to turn the steering wheel totally to both sides. Suddenly, this fluid starts pouring in HUGE quantities. I thought it was power steering fluid, because ir looked like oil. Anyway, when I got home, I hadn't loss any power steering fluid, so I got scared like hell and checked the engine oil. It was ok. Water maybe? Double checked, water level is ok and so is brake fluid. So what was that? How do I fix it? Should I be (more) worried?

The car has a small amount of shaking and kind of stutters as you slowly take off. It almost feels as if the power is cutting out.      The other day the problem seemed to worsen after I was sitting in a long line for the Canada/ Us border crossing. I noticed that the check engine light was on, and stayed on until I restarted the car some miles later. It has intermittently been coming on and off. I also noticed once or twice that the traction control system indicator came on and stayed on, it wouldn't go away even if I pushed the tcs button.    I think I may just have a dirty fuel filter, at least hopefully. Hopefully it isn't a transmission or other serious problem ( especially as the tcs light was on). Any ideas on what this could be? Thanks.

20090221050718AARLzhq	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What could be wrong with my cooling fan?	I have a 1996 Eagle Vision SE.  It has over 200,000 miles on it.  I live in Michigan and the temp was 14 degrees yesterday morning, when I first went out to start the car. Less than a minute after the cooling fan came on and stayed on the entire time i drove the car.  It would slow down, even stop for a a quick moment but start back up again. I started it up this morning and it did the same thing. The car did this one other time, but it only and that was a couple of months ago and it didn't do it more than one time.  I took it in and the mechanic said that he checked everything. The coolant, the fan...the car wasn't doing it then so naturally...he wasn't going to find anything wrong. Could it be that a sensor is going out or does it sound like it something more serious. The car runs fine otherwise, but the fan has me perplexed. Thanks for your input. I appreciate it very much.

I was looking around for a used car and came across this 2006 Brand New BMW 525i.  It is selling at a price that is equivalent to a used model of the same year.  The car dealership is a reputable car company in hong kong. The salesman told me that they brought in over 40 of these 2006 models in mid-2008.  Set aside the price, my question is, if the car has been sitting there for 2 years without running, will there be any damage to the engine as well as other mechanical and electrical part?  By the way, the car comes with a 2 year warranty, same as when you get a new car.    Your advice is much appreciated!  Thanks.

I have not been effected as of yet. My husband lost control of the car and side swiped an SUV on the highway and then a school bus rammed his rear end. We have heard absolutelty nothing from the county regarding this but the womans insurance company is holding him resposible for $4k worth of damages which was expected. We paid tickets that he reacieved for the accident and paid a little on the money owed to the insurance company but stopped as they refused to send us proof of what was owed and why. 6 months after the accident they had his license suspended. How can we go about getting this reinstated or getting him a license for employment purposes. We still refuse to pay the insurance company until we get in writing what is owed and why. When we spoke to them right after the license was suspended they said the woud reinstate if we send them 6 $100 checks and they said tehy would fax the itemized bill and what not which they never did.

It starts when cold and you can drive it to the store and turn it off and it will not start. A couple hrs later you can start it. It will start if you pull start it. Its a manual transmission. Any ideas let me know. Thank you

20090219173338AAxvPmV	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	Mobile Speed Cameras?	I was travelling along the M4 during the week and I decided to overtake a vehicle and so was in the fastest lane. I think I was doing around 80-85mph ish. I then noticed a speed camera van on a bridge facing towards me. I slowed down but I don't think i slowed down quick enough by the time i had seen it. Do they catch you coming towards it or after it? By the time i was going under the bridge, i was doing 70mph and after that too, but beforehand i was going faster. I couldn't break too much too quickly because an accident would have been caused otherwise seeing as i was in the fastest lane and there was traffic behind me. I didn't see any other cameras along the road or on any bridges so i don't think that means they were doing the average speed check? Or am i wrong? Ive only been driving a year and a half so im only allowed 6 points on my license and already have 3 thanks to another policeman with a speed camera gun on a quiet road, situated in a very dodgy place! that was a year ago though. If i do get a notice regarding this incident, can i appeal against it in anyway and if i cant, will i get the 6 points and lose my license? Thanks      P.S Does anybody know of an online site to check your driving convictions, such as to see what the driving offence was and the date of it? Because i have heard the DVLA are doing something like that now but i am not quite aware or sure about it. Thanks for all your help!

20090203094851AA718tD	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Mitsubishi	Lancer Evolution with Supra Engine!?	I want know if it is practical and affordable to install a (Toyota Supra Mk4) 2JZ-GTE engine into a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution, either VIII, IX or X. And would the Evo need a different or customised gearbox/transmission system to accept the additional power?      For those asking why, let me be brief yet informative:   +The Evo competes with Porsches' on the circuit   +Evo is perfect in almost every way but power is a let down   +Giving it a better engine would make it a serious contender      Lets point out that the Evo has a (4G63) 4cyl 2.0L engine pushed to the limit. It makes 286hp but emphasises more for torque 392Nm. It already has some lag from its single turbo and to increase performance significantly it would require a bigger turbo = more lag. Or twin-turbo = decreased power. Therefore, no room for sensible power improvement.      Now the supra (International model) has a twin-turbo 6cyl 3.0L, with 320hp and 435Nm. It has virtually no turbo-lag, a more reasonable performance and with more room for further improvement (larger turbo/exhaust replacement). I was told the 2JZ-GTE can be modified to have the same turbo lag as the 4G63 however produce roughly 400hp. Makes the "Green Hell" look like a playground!!      Here's some inspiration for this question:      "An engine swap remains one of the most cost effective ways to increase the power of a car." Torquecars.com      "If someone asks: can I fit an X engine in my Y car? The answer is yes but you should really be asking is it affordable and practical." Torquecars.com
