I'm not sure which generation it is. It's the small, boxy, thin one. I believe I got it about a year and a half ago and at the time, it was the "new" one. I hooked it up to the USB cord on the comp. today to sync some songs on it and to charge it. I had already sync the songs I had wanted to sync and then left it to charge while I was out running errands. I came back about 4 hours later and on the screen it says, "connected, eject before disconnecting." I did so and it is no longer connected to the USB cord, but it still has that screen on it and says the same thing. What could be wrong? What should I do? Thanks!

I already have an inclination towards one of them, but it would be great if you could give me your opinion (if you have knowledge about these cellphones) on one or more of these cellphones. You might as well just say whichever you think is the best.

I live in the PHILIPPINES and there is no way I'll get online with it. Hahahahaha.      Wii? or PS3?      Hmmm, in Philippines, Wii has been modified, meaning "cheap" games can be played. Hahahahaha. But with PS3? Hmm. Hmm.      I found out about this package: 18k pesos, Wii (US version, modified, brand new), with 30 games, 2 original controllers (nunchuck?), with case.      23.5k pesos, PS3 with 1 free game, and controller.      What do you think? Hihi. Thanks!            Plus! What games can I play with Wii and PS3 if ever? Suggested games? Thanks guys!      P.S. New question, is Canon Powershot SD1100 same with Canon IXUS 80 IS? Pleeaaase help! :) If not, what are their differences and which is better?      Well, according to Canon, they're just the same, Powershot is made in US and IXUS is Asia's counterpart. I'm battling with myself and with stress if I should buy the Powershot, because that's the only cheap camera I can find (e-bay.ph). No IXUS. Hmmm. Hahahaha. Waaaaahhh! Help! Help and more help!      Weeee..:)) Thank you all!      Replies, replies and more replies!      TWILIGHT fan here! Wooooo. Wanna watch the movie NOW!! Create the other books also NOW! Ok?      I want everything now.

20081114161441AAutqw4	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Help with syncing iPod with iTunes?	I've got an iPod Classic and iTunes. I know there is an option you can use for auto-syncing where everytime you plug in your iPod, it deletes your music and uploads your library from iTunes. I want it to do this, but I don't want it to do the same thing with all of my movies. How can I make just the music do this without the movies doing it, too? The reason behind this is that I've got a lot of movies on here, and I won't have the MP4's of them anymore if they get deleted from this. It took about a week and a half to convert all of the movies to MP4 and my iTunes library won't let me store them on there.
