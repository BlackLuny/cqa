969af41825bbf1c24b3050dc902ff2fcaa	El populismo de uribe los vuelve ciegos, y esos discursos de uribe que parece hipnotizando a las personas, uribe es intelectual pero para manipular a las masas y tener embobado al pueblo, supuestamente para el es mejor vender al país que defenderlo el dice que va cercar a a las farc para rescatar a los secuestrados eso es de locos no de un presidente o esta loco o no tiene sentimientos como va a acorralar a las farc para que ellos maten a los secuestrados, esta loco esa es otra prueba de que es paramilitar y si tienes razon las universidades publicas son las mejores universidades del pais, por que si exigen inteligencia en cambio en las universidades privadas de colombia exigen es vivesa o trampa en estas universidades privadas solo importa la plata los profesores son perezosos y simplemente pasan a los estudiantes aunque no sepa gran cosa, con tal de seguir trabajando los profesores son unos vendidos y las directivas de estas universidades y tienes razon tambien todo el gabinete uribe tiene la pinta de ser de universidades privadas, mimados y ani?ados con solo ver la cara del vicepresidente se sabe en que universidad estudio y las decisiones que han tomado no han sido muy convenientes para el pais, tratado de libre comercio se iba a negociar perjudicando a colombia y uribe feliz, contal de vender al pais el quiere convertir a colombia en una colonia gringa esto no es de estra?ar por que uribe siempre ha tenido dinero y se averguenza de colombia, asi que quiere convertir a colombia en una imitacion barata de estados unidos. Cuando un uribista mimado va  hacer una obra de arte,   NUNCA por que ellos quieren comprarla antes de hacerla simplemente son consumistas y no creacionistas tienen la mentalida de un narcotraficante que no le importa su pais solo le importa cuanta plata tenga para gastar, sin trabajo simplemente uribe vendio todas las empresas del estado para atacar a las farc solo sabe atacar a las farc y tlc y elogios para los paramilitares, las personas inteligentes y no tan ambisiosas de colombia se daran cuenta de lo que quiere realmente uribe con el pais.|`|mkHjSOgmaa	quepena con vos Atenea, pero puedo dar fe de que no es así, grandes círculos de intelecuales, de los mejores del país se declaran uribistas, incluso dentro de las universidades públicas, solo que nadie es tan bobo de arriesgarse a que alguno de los comunistoides en los claustros le ponga una papa bomba en la cabeza.<br>  <br>  Muchos de esos "intelectuales" que se hallan en el exterior, son personas que abiertamente dicen odiar Colombia, despreciarla y ser apátridas (me pregunto entonces con qué moral hablan, de hcho, pàra qué hablan) y los "intelectuales" de universidad pública sus "manifestaciones intelectuales" son siempre iguales:<br>  <br>  ?amenazar a sus detractores<br>  ?armar pedreas en extremo peligrosas<br>  ?muchos de ellos son marihuaneros<br>  ? Son personas que no escuchan a nadie sino que siguen sus absoltuas convicciones (tenía entendido que los intelectuales de verdad son abiertos al dialogos y no le van a la violencia)<br>  ?entre mcuhos otros hechos<br>  <br>  Esos son los intelectuales a los que te refieres???<br>  <br>  Intelectuales: muchos escritores que han decidido apostarle a Colombia, quedarse aquí y aportarle a la patria, científicos que siguen trabajando en Colombia, patocinados por COLCIENCIAS!! en el SISTEMA NACIONAL DE INVESTIGACIóN creado por el gobierno Uribe!!!!. entre mcuhos otros.<br>  <br>  Informate mejor, no juzguez a la ligera y nada, continua con el debate ;)<br>  <br>  Saludos desde Bogotá<br>  Ah! una cosa. Viva Uribe!!!  jejejej<br>  David|`|wQ6L3qf6aa	me uno a tu precepción que es muy real. Los uribistas estan en las mediocres universidades privadas, de donde a proposito han salido los corrupotos del país. Un estudio hace unoa a?os mostró que los politicos investigados por corrupción habian salido en su mayoría de universidades como la Libre, el Rosario, la Javeriana y el externado, santo tomas etc. Son los que han apoyado el gobierno corrupto y mafioso de Uribe. Y es obvio puesto que en esas universidades esta demostrado que los influyentes ponen a sus hijos y les comrpan los titulos, los promueven por influencias y dinero.|`|f37041135ac7ba0f643b90e148068b43aa	Me parece un signo de salud de ese sector de la sociedad colombiana.

Eso es realmente tonto, justamente los examenes o test son para darnos cuenta de las aptitudes y actitudes de la persona con respecto a determinada area, solo asi se puede "depurar" el numero de personas que entran a determinada carrera (y aun asi, en Mexico el numero de personas que acaban la universidad son la mitad o menos de los que entraron). Es ilogico querer darle a todos los estudiantes todo gratuito, se les da el examen y solo en base al esfuerzo de cada quien es como se determina quien sigue estudiando y quien no, ese es el gran problema del populismo, entrega apoyos y dinero sin pedir nada a cambio, ni siquiera un peque?o esfuerzo, no crees ???<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  En lugar de un pulgar abajo esperaba una respuesta coherente, no crees izquierdosita amiga ???|`|pmDbEEdjaa	Hace dos días recibí en mi correo "Atenea asked a question", con este mismo título, pero ayer cuando quise leerla, había desaparecido. ?Te la denunciaron? ?Habías escrito lo mismo?

Sigo con atención particular las preguntas y respuestas que se refieren a mi país, y por alguna misteriosa razón, el nivel intelectual de las críticas hacia nuestro gobierno (que no es realmente de izquierda, pero en la mente de los cazadores de brujas lo es) es, salvo honrosas excepciones, patético.|`|umtVrdgNaa	No, no es casualidad, sino que es normal, lo que debe caracterizar a un intelectual es la capacidad de critica y observar criticamente todos los fenomenos que ocurren, entonces es natural que, lo que transmiten los medios de comunicacion al servicio de los intereses del gran poder economico (es decir la prensa, radio y television en general, salvo que en Colombia exista algun medio alternativo -lo dudo mucho, ya que con los narcoparamilitares gobernando, al dia siguiente desaparacen a todo el staff- ) no les haga la menor mella, y puedan apreciar la realidad a cabalidad. <br>  <br>  Entonces como cualquier persona bien informada (no manipulada, ni enajenada por el poder economico) deben ser anti-uribistas.|`|898b56d4ded6b7f058a3dd39366c7cc5aa	Como ha sucedido en todos los países de latinoamérica siempre ha habido intelectuales comprometidos con las causas sociales.

Si luego de leerlos alguien piensa  que Uribe es bueno no leyeron entonces.|`|j0Jyurf7aa	Tu pregunta tiene un cierto aire elitista.<br>  Además, puede prestarse a una lectura distinta... En tanto si das por hecho que la gente inteligente, instruída, de alto nivel está contra Uribe, por a?adidura se desprende que las clases pobres, postergadas, incultas, que no han podido acceder a una educación que les permita mejorar su calidad de vida y que por ello solamente pueden y deben preocuparse por su subsistencia serían, entonces, quienes apoyarían a Uribe.<br>  Lo cual es decir entonces que el país real está con él, y el país de la torre de marfil le da la espalda... <br>  Como ya he dicho muchas veces aquí, no se debe caer en falsas oposiciones... Ni Todos, ni ningunos...<br>  Además, desconozco lo que significa el movimiento intelectual colombiano... te deseo de todo corazón que en nada se parezca a los mercenarios que tenemos por el Sur... a los que ha definido brillantemente Aquiles...<br>  Algún día te contaré cual es la definción de intelectual que se usa por estos lados... :=)<br>  <br>  Saludos... !!!|`|lUeBprhOaa	tu crees q por la fama son intelectuales!!!!! y tu crees q porq la nacional imparte la mejor educacion del pais...son realmente racionales en la vida real!!!!<br>  realmente te equivocas|`|lhdh4sYEaa	Es posible. En todas partes ocurre más o menos lo mismo. Los jóvenes inteligentes suelen ser de izquierda, pero en la medida que comienzan a ganar dinero, poco a poco se van acomodando al sistema y terminan exactamente donde Uribe está hoy, lamiéndole las botas a Bush.<br>  Por otra parte, Chávez dista mucho de ser un intelectual. Es un milico populista que llevará a su país a la ruina y arrastrará con él a algunos vecinos.|`|1fPcQiDeaa	No es casualidad, los intelectuales colombianos son muy inteligentes, es bueno que alguien se de cuenta de la realidad y la denuncie.

Son los medios de comunicación, que como ya sabemos los controla el Estado, en este caso el Estado de Colombia.   __La gente recibe una gran cantidad de propaganda encontra de cualquier acuerdo de Paz habiendo Satanizado de antemano a las FARC.<br>  <br>  Yo desde aquí no le veo salida al conflicto, ya que se ha colocado a las FARC entre la espada y la pared. <br>  <br>  Uribe y sus amos los EEUU solo les dan una salida, que es morir en batalla. Se les a dado el status de terroristas y esto no permite una salida negociada.  Ya sabes internacionalmente este status es una sentencia de muerte para aquellos que son se?alados de esta manera.<br>  <br>  Yo me encuentro en México... Y dejame decirte que los medios de comunicación estan volcados en contra de Hugo Chávez...  Es lógico que esto pase, ya que se afectaron los intereses económicos en ese país de la Televisora más grande de México ( Televisa ).<br>  <br>  Hay una total campa?a de desprestigio en contra de Chávez y las FARC.  Llegando al grado de convertirse en eco del gobierno de Uribe.<br>  <br>  Esto es una muestra de que los EEUU tienen metidas todas sus garras en América Latina para hacer que cualquier plan de paz fracase en Colombia.<br>  <br>  Sería ilógico pensar que el gobierno mexicano se convirtiera en alcahuete del gobierno de Uribe, por eso es que te digo que son los EU quienes estan ejerciendo una fuerte presión política a favor de su títere Uribe y en contra de los intentos de Paz promovidos por Chávez y las FARC.<br>  <br>  Es muy lamentable que esto pase, ya que es a todas claras muestra se vé que los Estados Unidos estan usando como campo de pruebas para su armamento convencional a Colombia.  Yo lo siento por tu País.<br>  <br>  Es muy posible que la solución se encuentre removiendo al presidente Uribe, y así entonces se podría tal vez empezar a encontrar una salida a los problemas de Colombia.<br>  <br>  Uribe lo a demostrado en los hechos que sigue al pie de la letra las órdenes que le giran desde Washington.<br>  <br>  <br>  ???

Inclusive con el tema de Chávez, tiene el respaldo del partido de Izquierda-El Polo Alternativo Democrático.

Las Universidades en Colombia son de nivel muy superior pero para el resto del mundo sobre todo en Europa no tienen mayor importancia.<br>  <br>  2. Porque una persona haya estudiado en X universidad no implica que sea una persona intelectual; (porque si a mí me lo preguntas Ardila Lule y compa?ia no son más que una bandada de oligarcas y culero.s).<br>  <br>  Conclusión: Tú pregunta tiene parte de verdad y parte de mentira, pero si hay algo seguro: Los que siguen a Uribe no miran a su alrededor.|`|H2EVG51iaa	Es muy sencillo responder el porque las personas de estas universidades tienen un pensamiento similar, no es porque sean de los mejores ni porque sean los superintelectuales o los mas inteligentes, la razón es simple, cuando sales del colegio la universidad es un total cambio y adquieres consciencia ciudadana la cual se ve siempre inclinada al pensamiento que se maneja en el ambiente en el que te desenvuelves, el pensamiento de la mayoría de las universidades publicas siempre va contra el gobierno, (sea cual sea, no solo el de uribe) porque hasta ahora no hemos tenido muy buenos gobiernos.<br>  <br>  No soy uribista pero tampoco anti-uribista, no pertenezco a ninguna de estas universidades estudio en una privada y eso no me hace ni mas ni menos intelectual  que tu.<br>  <br>  Respeto a los uribistas porque seguramente muchos de ellos tendrán mas o iguales estudios que las dos. <br>  <br>  concuerdo con Salamandra tu pregunta es arrogante ya que no solo estas subestimando a la gente que no pertenece a ese circulo y a la que no puede acceder a lo que tu llamas "Educación MUY SUPERIOR" sino que asumes que cualquier uribista lo es por ser ignorante.|`|Kz5RlzzCaa	hola mira yo estudio en la udea y tienes la razon es asi pero todo viene de una simple razon y es que el gobierno del presidente uribe a ataco muy fuerte la educacion publica es increible que menos del 5% del presupuesto nacional sea invertido en la educacion que es el pilar de cualquier pais, un pais no necesita que le den casas, comida o esas cosas un pais necesita educacion y lo demas lo conseguiran por su propia cuenta como dice esa frase tan sabia no des el pescado ense?a a pescar y eso pasa en colombia las eleccciones se ganan porque los politicos y sus grandes empresarios que hay detras hacen eso con las personas les adornan su vida un poco a cambio de un voto pero detras de esto estan los intereses de los mas grandes empresarios de colombia que son los que apoyan al gobierno de uribe, yo personalmente no me declaro anti-uribista y tampoco uribista pero no me gusta lo que se hace en colombia con la educacion publica, porque si tu miras los intelectuales que las universidades como de los andes que es una excelente universidad estan con uribe pero es debido a eso que este gobierno no le da el trato que se merece la educacion publica|`|duiynNdHaa	Yo. creo que los colombianos somos inteligentes por que tratar de vivir en un pais donde los derechos humanos vitales estan por el suelo hay que serlo....como ganarse el pan, como tratar de que tus ideales sean neutros, para no ofender a las partes y te hagan pedazos.....yo creo que uribe no necesita mension, o nombrarlo tanto, para que?  deja que el por su propio peso caiga.... algun dia colombia saldra de su estancamiento moral... no se que te refieres con intelectual los que tubieron el previlegio de ir a una universidad... pues no maltrates al pueblo bajo de colombia sesgandolos e incluyendolos en el clan Uribistas....viva Colombia Libre y Progresista.|`|enyiH0STaa	no es verdad|`|iO98Z2lZaa	no es casualidad, es que cualquiera con acceso a un poquito de información veraz sabe reconocer la clase de ser que es Uribe, y lo peor de la televisión colombiania es que nisiquiera les importa sus artistas recuerdo una marcha de actores colombianos en contra del TLC porque eso los iba a dejar sin chamba, lamentablemente mucho del pueblo colombiano no se cuanto, esta ipnotisado por los medios colomianos algo asi como lo que ocurre en USA donde FOX y sus similares se encargan de mantener en penumbras al pueblo de USA.

Para no ir muy lejos, el gobierno de su cacique chavez ya ha cerrado muchos medios de prensa por éstos no arrodillársele a su gobierno.<br>  <br>  Por cierto, en qué consiste la genialidad de fernando vallejo? <br>  <br>  Y por último, las universidades que menciona, son públicas, (soy egresado de una) y ahi es muy común que haya gente con el llamado ¨bicho¨ que consiste en que les da por ser contestatarios de izquierda, pero cuando maduran, sientan cabeza y se vuelven realistas. Claro, no siempre todos maduran.<br>  <br>  Si el afan suyo de ahora es por la amplia favorabilidad de Uribe (no en encuestas sino hablando con la gente en la calle), y náusea que producen la farc, piedad cordoba, carlos gaviria, o hugo chavez, sepa que se da por el hecho de que la banda de la farc en más de 40 a?os no han hecho nada en favor del pueblo que dicen defender (que ineficacia, no?) solo tragedias y porque ceder a la exigencia de los oligarcas cabecillas de la farc de despejar unos municipios para que puedan narcotraficar tranquilamente solo propiciaría más secuestros y masacres.<br>  <br>  Ojalá los que no se han percatado reconozcan que la unión es la que hace la fuerza. Ah, y tambien hay mucha gente inteligente que apoya a Uribe. No subestime a los colombianos.

Ahora hay más dinero en la calle por gasto del gobierno por lo que hay más demanda de  alimentos, un administrador debe preveer eso y tener suficiente para cuando se estime que ocurra; aquí no sólo no se tomaron las medidas para incremetar la producción sino que el estado invirtió menos sumado a que los empresarios hicieron lo mismo por desconfianza en la propiedad, por amenazas de todo tipo por parte del gobierno, por la inseguridad... muchos sencillamente se fueron. Y no es tan sencillo como dice el presidente: si no quieres estar aquí vete, no, antes de botarlos tenemos que estar seguros que no va a influir con el bienestar del pueblo. Pero la soberbia, prepotencia y orgullo domina el sentimiento y la razón. La otra opción que es, en vista que no hay, comprar a los de afuera no resuelve ni a la mitad porque a nivel mundial se vive este problema por crecimientos de países y por los estragos del recalentaminto global. <br>  <br>  ?Recuerdas las vacas que trajeron porque "ahora sí vamos a tener tanta leche que vamos a exporar"? En un aló presidente le reclamaron los beneficiados que esas vacas no daban sino medio litro... claro, eso ya lo sabían desde antes los que en verdad estan en el monte y conocen el negocio, aparte que muchas vinieron enfermas... más dinero y tiempo perdido. O no tiene buenos asesores a la hora de comprar o es un negocio. En conclusión ?QUE MALA ADMINISTRACION!<br>  <br>  Lamento que estés padeciendo, a parte de, lo de la gasolina.

En Venezuela, un presidente respondón y con impetus de dictador, dicen los oligarcas, mas igual que en Brasil, desde que asumió los menos favorecidos por la vida están siendo ayudados y MUCHO.<br>  -Por otro lado, cuando un gobierno de carácter socialista o humanitario asume, los capitalistas y la oposicion derechista SIEMPRE van a usar todos sus argumentos contra, inclusive de llamar a alguien de absolutista y dictador. El presidente de Venezuela puede tener el perfil de un mandón, pero al responderle a USA no mirandolo desde abajo, mas de igual a igual, se ha angariado un gran enemigo que domina la opinion pública global... <br>  Venezuela y Brasil han dado una virada, los pueblos que han colocado a esos líderes en el poder evolucionaron en sabiduria, cansados de votar en quien los roba y explota, de quien los domina y discrimina.<br>  Quien nada tiene, tiene todo a ganar con eso.<br>  Quien tiene mucho, teme perderlo. A veces ese mucho fué adquirido explotando, robando y matando, amenazando y haciendo cosas erradas, por eso son contra quien está dando luz a los pobres, porque como han surrupiado, TEMEN QUE LA JUSTICIA LOS ALCANCE.<br>  <br>  En Latinoamerica las cosas están claras. Despues de siglos de persecucion por parte del TERRORISMO DE ESTADO, nuevamente estamos tomando el rumbo de un continente autónomo y libre entre comillas. Digo asi porque en el dialogo e intercambio entre naciones, siempre los paises ricos y con influencia en los bancos internacionales hablan mas alto. <br>  Eso va a mudar si apoyamos las causas latinas y combatimos todas las injusticias del tercer mundo. Ahi entonces la luz iluminará este planeta, atrasado por los demonios materialistas...|`|3f5eb15885d8f8d420849a9e2adabc6faa	Bien tu no entiendes, cuando se dice "de todos" significan las obligaciones, la deuda externa, el esfuerzo y " de todos " el bienestar, la paz social, la educación, la salud, es solo para los políticos, ? entiendes.?, son democráticos el primer "de todos" es del pueblo y el segundo de los políticos y tu preguntas quien tiene gasolina, leche, arroz, el azúcar y todavía eres capaz de preguntar por el ETC.<br>  <br>  ? hay Dios, que ganas de preguntar lo obvio.!<br>  Pero por lo menos preguntas<br>  Suerte y lucha por un mundo mejor|`|442222871091aa0b5a9d02305c04585daa	Del gordo Antonini......|`|6yNHEzMuaa	Tambien de todos los venezolanos. <br>  Lo que sucede es que en ese pais desde que se monto en el poder un tal CAP comenzo en forma acelerada a desmontar leyes nacionalistas que favorecian en cierta forma el desarrollo de todos los que habitaban en el territorio d la republica. <br>  Ese CAP legislo por ley habilitante.<br>  Paso el tiempo y un  tal Giusti de PDVSA junto con otros apatridas unos Paquetico Rodriguez y su combo, Pedro Palma, Faraco, Teochoro Peckoff, los banqueros, Arturo Sosa, David Morales, A.

Uribe no volverá a invadir otro país militarmente, aunque tampoco Ecuador ni Venezuela moverán un dedo para sacar guerrilleros de sus países. Colombia no puede combatir a las FARC impulsivamente puesto que éstas atacarían fieles a su costumbre, cobardemente, no al gobierno sino a la población civil, la más inocente y las más débil.

Kb5ZJLQvaa	Sir, you could have somebody from the states (friends, family, or rear d) mail it to you. That way it can be packaged so it will not break versus putting it in your ruck/duffel where it may possibly break. As for how to keep it clean and safe, try to buy a hardened case for your camera so if you do drop it at some point it will minimize damage. For the laptop, either buy some canned air or get some from supply. Dust it off with that every few days and once in a while take it apart (or if you are not technically inclined get someone who is to give you a hand) and blow out all the dust and sand from inside. I have had my camera and laptop here for about 7 months and haven't had any problems with either one. One more thing, invest in a decent cooling pad for your laptop to keep it from overheating. I like to use www.newegg.com for anything I buy and they ship to APOs.|`|31d8c0ca03879295922dad03356637c4aa	as you know there is alot of dust in iraq so its hard to keep anything clean and working my advise to you is pack them in computer bags camera bags and bring electronical clean whipes and a lil brush to sweep the dust off.  we sent our electrical equipment to iraq but dont bring anything that to care too much about like a 4000 dollar computer or camera my husband broke everything atleast once but hes kinda prone to break stuff.  <a href="http://www.aberrationphotography.com/Site/intro2-673.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aberrationphotography.com/Sit...</a><br>  <br>  a laptop is great for keeping intouch with fam too and entertainment reasons.  we have a freind within the unit that is in to photography and he came to iraq with over 10,000 dollars worth the equipment and came back with awesome pictures so it is possible to do just a lil bit of a pain he will not ship his stuff so he carried it everywhere he is one of the few that they let get away with alot of stuff like that i dont know how he manages to move with his gear his ruck and all of his camera equipment but some how the skinny thing manages check out his site if youd like|`|Srfl38A3aa	those pelican briefcases are like tanks but I am not sure if they have ones that are not so huge.

NhcUB7g9aa	O.k. in order-<br>  <br>  1. Detection of crime & establishment of proofs<br>  2. Cautioning suspect<br>  3. Arrest<br>  4. Accused taken to nearest Police Station to where the offence was committed. Bail granted or remanded in custody.  Bail usually granted if Misdemeanor depending on varying factors like past offences committed of similar nature- likelihood of re-offending etc. (accused has presumption of bail)  That is - if doubt exists then bail must be given on benefit of doubt.  Remand (incarceration pending plea/trial) reserved for Indictable or serious matters.  Accused can still get bail for crimes like murder etc. provided he has paid a surety set by the court and/or has good antecedence with regards to living and community support i.e. cannot be a bum off the street or without a fixed place of abode.<br>  5.  Court hearing stages<br>  i  For Mention - Establish time to enter a plea or set hearing date.<br>  ii Hearing - Local or District court (accused has choice for minor matters i.e. Misdemeanor) Courts usually go straight to trial if a plea of not guilty or no plea in Indictable matters.<br>  Minor - Local Court<br>  Indictable - District/Supreme Court<br>  6.  Pleas of guilty - Court goes to sentencing stage.<br>  7. Trail  (not guilty) - Involves jury selection for  trial.<br>  8.  Guilty of Misdemeanor after pleading not guilty - Sentencing may be harsher.<br>  9.  As above if found guilty by jury.<br>  <br>  Defense = person appointed for the defense of the accused (Lawyer/Solicitor/Barrister)<br>  Prosecution = Crown Prosecutor/Crown Solicitor/Police Prosecutor who prosecute the accused for the offence committed<br>  <br>  10. Sentencing - judge can take into account all the accused past offences in determining appropriate sentence i.e. Fine/ Gaol or both or section 556A which is a section for Misdemeanors allowing provision of a guilty finding/offence proved by prosecution - however no conviction is recorded.<br>  <br>  The onus of proof always lies with the prosecution - not he accused.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps......  good luck!|`|PuxP6UzVaa	I don't know.

As unfair as that might seem, your friend would not be forced to deleverage his assets under the McCain proposal. <br>  <br>  There are, however, ways other than the McCain proposal that would permit the federal government to jump start the real estate market for principal residences, which is a benefit for all homeowners, and for all municipalities who rely on real estate tax revenues to fund elementary and high schools, police, fire and emergency services, and ultimately for the economy since 70% of the American economy's existence is derived from consumer spending.

He has a college degree, has worked in the community, which millions of Americans are doing, and he has voted present in the senate.<br>  <br>  Also, just look at all his radical associations, either he has a terrible judgement of picking friends or he is just like one of them. I believe the latter is true.<br>  <br>  In addition, he is not what he says he is. Obama's father figure mentor (in his memoir book, he refers to him as only "Frank") was Frank Marshall Davis, leader of the Communist Group USA, which makes him very dangerous for our country.

The FBI is already investigating CEO's going back 10 years, when the housing bubble started in 1998. They include, Freedie, Fannie, Lehman, Bear Sterns, Merryl Lynch, Washington Mutual and AIG. These are the people who are responsible of our money, banking system, and investments. And Obama has been receiving sweet deals from these same people.<br>  <br>  This is very serious!!!

We can see the intention by the "sample bias."<br>  If I did a poll, I wouldn't ask people at random because the odds are against my sample being any good. I would have to find the composition of likely voters and be sure my sample reflected as similar a composition as I could get. If media polls did that and made poor assumptions, the result would be wrong but you might think they didn't intend for it to be wrong. The thing is, each poll has a sample more weighted to Democrats than the previous poll. This makes it obvious they are deliberately inflating the results in the Democrats' favor. Last cycle ('04) near the end they were polling almost 3 times as many Democrats as Republicans then pretended they were SHOCKED when Kerry didn't win.|`|b34097e00cc43af49d3e428d9a0bbb58aa	Much of the polling is done by people who have an agenda.  The people that are doing the polling often aren't trained well and they interpret what the polled people are saying to fit what they want to hear.  That one poll is so far out of consistancy from the others is revealing that the poll or the people sponsoring the poll have a political agenda and the poll is not genuine.
AA10344136	It's brazenly evident CNN is pro-Obama and I'm stunned at how propagandist CNN has become in featuring "news articles" that promote Obama and discredit John McCain.  <br>  <br>  CNN is a disgrace to everything American news journalism stands for.  <br>  <br>  I can say that with certainty because I've seen the proof: CNN's main page features a very large pro-Obama campaign advertisement.

He got us out of Clinton's recession, got us through 9/11 and freed 50 million people, creating democracies in the Middle East for the first time in history.

If he had not cut taxes and pulled the economy out of Clinton's recession, the deficit would have been MUCH higher. You guys really need to learn, live and love this FACT. Cutting taxes promotes business which increases revenue. Raising taxes, in fact, reduces revenue.<br>  <br>  Actually, yes. Up until two years ago the deficit was dropping rapidly, even with the war, because income exceeded expenses. In fact, if the economy had remained strong, the federal budget would have been balanced and we'd have started paying off our creditors. Then the economy slowed and income dropped off.

bQLQdRBZaa	Tax cuts for the wealthy, no. There's no evidence supportingthe claim that this actually creates economic growth. To be fair, though, it's nevr been done in he way the economists suggest it stipulated.  Their argument stated that tax cuts for the wealthy could help the economy IF the money were (required) invested in NEW capital investment (not just in stocks, etc.--in new facilities, equipment, etc.) The "Bush tax cuts" and similar measures have never included this stipulations.<br>  <br>  Tax cuts for small business are another matter.  There is overwhelming evidence that such tax cuts, along with a number of other  strategies for supporting and promoting small businesses and entrepreneurs, are the #1 best way to create new jobs and economic growth. Thre's data going all the way back to the 19th century and it's virtually unanimous on this point. NOTE: emphasis on small/medium sized firms. Large corporations can and do play valuable roles in the economy--and are essentialin some industries. But they are NOT good at creating jobs or high levels of economic growth.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Actually, the 2003 tax cuts resulted in years of growth and the creation of over 5 million new jobs. It is only in the recent economic dropoff that unemployment has risen.<br>  <br>  Cutting the tax rates on businesses and on capital gains (supply-side tax cuts) stimulate job growth and investment. This has been proven to hold true each and every time it has been enacted. The historical evidence fully supports it.<br>  <br>  Kennedy's tax cuts in the early 1960s. Reagan's tax cuts in the 1980s. Even Bush's tax cuts in 2003.<br>  <br>  Business and investment are the engines that drive the economy.|`|LFE0e8Qdaa	Yes.  Government revenues also rise when taxes are lowered.  So, Obama will raise taxes, spend more, take in less, and redistribute wealth.  Giving money to poor people is throwing money down a rat hole.  Like spending more on education, there is absolutely no benefit.  Many poor folks who've won the lottery are poor a few years later, poor people are poor for a reason, they make bad decisions.  Government policies won't change that.|`|AA11105711	Actually what the evidence suggests is that cutting taxes for the wealthy only gives them more money to invest overseas to further accelerate the loss of American jobs.  Cutting taxes losses jobs not creates them.<br>  <br>  |`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	-Yes.<br>  -Yes. It's happened every time, without exception.<br>  - Our tax cuts kicked in 5 years back, not 7.5. In that time period, we have seen GDP increase, real wages increase and unemployment steadily fall until the post '06 crash. A market turn down was a predictable (and WAS predicted) follow-up to a DNC Congressional takeover. Markets are predictive. They "react" to what they expect will happen down the road. Electing Democrats is a promise of higher taxes and more balks to commerce so markets turn down every time.<br>  -Historically, tax cuts have always improved the economic curve. There has not ever been even a single exception. <br>  What do I mean by the curve? Let's say things are crashing fast. A tax cut might not be enough to turn it around into growth but it will ALWAYS in the very worst case at least slow the fall.<br>  It works in reverse, too. Increasing taxes in a boom doesn't always reverse it into a fall but it does ALWAYS, without exception, at least slow the growth.<br>  Bottom line: cuts always help, increases always hurt. No exceptions. Never.|`|IDZTtipeaa	Perhaps we should ask someone like Paul Krugman, recent Nobel Prize winner in economics.  He has written several books and, over the past several years, has been sounding the alarm about the current events.  He predicted the bursting of the housing market bubble and the subsequent fallout.  He predicted that Bush's tax cuts would not create jobs and could actually lead to a recession.  Of course he was written of as a typical blame America first liberal who wanted Bush to fail.  Too bad he was right and we didn't listen.<br>  The bottom line is quite simple.  Trickle-down supply side economics does not work for the majority.  It benefits a wealthy minority.|`|NzKNNFwIaa	Until the past several months, the US has experienced overall job growth.  High energy prices recently really hurt our economy and the job growth and of course, the subrprime mortgage mess which was caused by the Dems compassionate idea of extending mortgages to lower income families (unfortunately, many of these loans were not affordable to them in the long term).  If you look at the history of tax cuts, they do lead to increased economic growth as well as increased revenue (which really makes me wonder why the hell Obama wants to raise the tax rates).  Higher tax rates leave fewer dollars for employers to expand their business and hire more employees or give their current employees higher wages.  |`|5vVMsmkqaa	It helps if the companies receiving these tax breaks are understaffed and NEED to create new jobs, but companies aren't just going to create jobs because of them.  Business owners aren't going to hand out raises because of them either, which means all the money being saved is being saved by the owner himself, not anybody else.<br>  <br>  I've asked a similar question and the Cons say the tax cuts DON'T and SHOULDN'T guarantee that they'll create jobs.|`|AA11634870	For the wealthy no, they either support the stock and bond houses more or maybe increase their purchases. For the small business person yes it does. both Democrats and Republicans know this. It helps create more small businesses and encourages growth in job creation. Most economist feel anything that helps business helps the overall economy.|`|q8UshwzZaa	once and for all<br>  70% of the american economy is the CONSUMER<br>  you hurt the consumer, you hurt the economy<br>  you help the consumer, you help the economy<br>  <br>  will the republicans ever pull their heads out long enough to learn this?|`|60e8cb6c9ed3b74042e0a7c0b6b47989aa	No.  Demand for products increases jobs better, which means you need to make sure there is money, directly, in the hands of more people who will buy those goods.<br>  <br>  Trickle-down has long been discredited.  We don't need to go back to the more draconian top tax brackets (90%+), but there needs to be a balance between supply and demand.  Trickle-down economics is merely a tool to bamboozle people into supporting giving rich people more money, at their own expense.<br>  <br>  The only reason why he haven't seen a downturn previously is because the system was propped up by substituting the balancing of demand with easy credit and debt instead.  The credit card has finally maxed out.<br>  <br>  Small businesses, on the other hand, and I mean truly small businesses, do help to generate jobs, and since most, when they are small, operate on very narrow margins, tax cuts to them would help them to stay in business and to be able to offer jobs.<br>  <br>  A lot of people will say "tax revenues, overall, grew after tax cuts..." but tax revenues grow, overall, if you leave the rates alone, so the question is, "Compared to what?"  Do they grow MORE than they would if taxes were not cut?  No, they don't.  When Kennedy cut the taxes, the top marginal rate was over 90%.  It's a big difference cutting from 90% to 60% or so versus cutting from 39.6% to 35%.  The architect of Kennedy's tax cuts was vehemently against "supply side" cuts, and said the evidence was overwhelming that further cutting had almost no economic benefit.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Well I can't say much about what tax cuts do for the Wealthy but I can say from owning a small business for years. The tax increases put my little business in a position where raises were less and at one time I was paying 100% of the employees insurance program which I had to cut in half.<br>  <br>  These cuts were not done to put more money in my pocket but to keep the product prices competitive and pay all the additional taxes.<br>  <br>  It's more than Income Tax on the company. All taxes went up. <br>  Tax on Inventory, Tax of Sales, Tax on Property, Tax on the Utilities, and on and on.<br>  <br>  My accunting cost went up 25%. Just to account to the governemnt for all these additional taxes. Accountants don't work free.<br>  <br>  This put my company in a no growth situation.<br>  <br>  That is my EXPERIENCE.<br>  <br>  If you don't blieve it then get out there and start a small business up and then you will know.|`|Zyvl0iHvaa	Well there is proof that higher taxes sends jobs overseas to countries with lower tax rates, that is all the information I need to know.|`|gh7mVCCfaa	There is a positive correlation, but when I poop the smell in the bathroom increases.<br>  <br>  See how positive correlations work?|`|MEReSvZeaa	Yes, it does, and yes there is proof.<br>  <br>  When Bush cut taxes, federal revenues for 1040 forms went down, and revenues for payroll taxes went way up.  This is proof that people paid less, corporations paid less, and more people were working and contributing to the payroll taxes.|`|krAlopvsaa	It worked when Kennedy did it, It worked when Reagan did it,  I believe it worked when Bush did it.<br>  <br>  Bush was faced with higher energy prices than the 1970's, the 6.1% unemployment would be a banner year in the late 70's.<br>  <br>  He is also faced with a housing buble.<br>  <br>  BOTH OIL AND THE HOUSING BUBBLE ARE INDEPENDANT OF TAX CUTS.

Portugal fue una de las naciones que no se plegó al bloqueo, razón por la cual Napoleón buscó una alianza con Espa?a para invadir a Portugal. Cuando Espa?a se negó, en contra de la voluntad de algunos de sus generales, el mismo Napoleón comandó las fuerzas que invadieron Espa?a y derrotaron al ejército de este país. También derrotó al ejército inglés que vino a la ayuda de Espa?a. Finalmente conquistó Portugal en 1807 y en 1808 colocó a su hermano José en el trono de Espa?a, dejando Nápoles como una monarquía manejada por su cu?ado, Joachim Murat.<br>  <br>  Tras la partida de Napoleón, el pueblo espa?ol se rebeló, iniciando la guerra entre las tropas francesas y las espa?olas (apoyadas por Gran Breta?a), teniendo un papel fundamental la lucha de guerrilla. Este conflicto supuso un gran desgaste humano (se ha estimado en 300.000 bajas) y económico para Francia. Se calcula que el 10% de las bajas tanto del lado espa?ol como el francés ocurrieron durante los dos sitios a la ciudad de Zaragoza, entre el 15 de junio de 1808 y el 21 de febrero de 1809. Por otra parte, Austria rompió el pacto con Francia y Napoleón se vio obligado a comandar sus fuerzas en los frentes del Danubio y Alemania. En la batalla de Aspern-Essling (21 y 22 de mayo de 1809) cerca de Viena, Napoleón estuvo a punto de perder su ejército, sin que el enemigo tampoco lograra un triunfo. Tras una tregua de casi dos meses, nuevamente se enfrentaron ambos ejercidos, pero esta vez el ejército francés derrotó al austriaco en la batalla de Wagram, el 6 de julio de 1809.<br>  <br>  En otras palabras se quedaron con las ganas de regir a Espana; quizas por eso.|`|7ba46c28496ee99b633e425eef289005aa	Los franceses no odian a los espa?oles.

0jhzFOV8aa	Whatever source you go to, never forget the most important rule of journalism, consider the source.<br>  Commercial broadcast media are hysterical, extreme and narrow because they need viewers to sell ads. They are driven by viewership and have devolved to pandering like a reality TV show. I'm sorry if I sound like I'm exaggerating when I write that, but that is my perception. I was in PR for 10 years, I know something about spin.<br>  <br>  While keeping in mind the liberal bias, I find PBS credible and less hysterical.

You can find them by googling "adopt a soldier". Some have requirements such as sending x amount of care packages per month, others just ask for one letter a month. Its really up to you. There are many where you can pick the branch of service, if you want to have just one soldier, or a whole unit. No matter which place you go through, it's great of you to want to show your support.<br>  <br>  The one that I went through you are only required to send one letter a month, but you can send as many care packages and/or letters as you want. They only ask that you email the company once a month to keep them updated, so they know you are still actively mailing stuff. If you don't, they take your name off and put your soldiers name back in the pool for re-adoption (this way he or she isn't left out in the cold). They take your info, and in about 5 days, they send you the name, address, rank (if any) and how long they are going to be over there for. The one I went through is not a dating service. I made sure of it before I joined (I'm married). I've only had mine for less than a month, already I have sent two letters and a bunch of care packages.

JDAbWnJraa	It probably isn't a good idea at all, but neither has 7 1/2 years of being an openly divided country been... <br>  <br>  Seems that nobody learned the lessons from Somalia. The Somali militias targeted the helicopters so heavily with RPG's that day because they knew that if they could bring one of those birds down, they could tie up the Rangers on the ground. And the longer they could tie up the Rangers, the better the chances they had of drawing blood. If they could draw blood, the American public would lose their stomachs and the American troops would leave the country. So they threw themselves in front of our troops by the thousands, down narrow alleys, in order to exact some casualties on the Americans and Oops.... what happened???  Exactly what I just described. The public cried and Clinton pulled the troops out.<br>  <br>  So you see, the insurgents in Iraq and Afghanistan have not fought us, nor do they really need to. All they have done is made sure that they rack up a couple of American casualties here and there so that the American people will lose their stomachs, start protesting and the troops will leave those countries. The insurgents celebrated a long time ago, when the Cindy Sheehans of this country started getting all the media coverage, they've just had to maintain the status quo since then.<br>  <br>  To quote my Father, a Vietnam Veteran, "We (the military) didn't lose in Vietnam, we won every single battle on the ground. Washington lost Vietnam."   And more than that, the American citizens sitting on their comfortable collective azzes back in the states, who could not stand together and present a unified resolve to the rest of the world, lost and will lose the war.|`|AA11600810	Yep and I'm damn proud to say I didn't vote for him.|`|AA10240928	I heard we spend $65 billion a month in Iraq.

If Bush or McCain were in office, the scenario would be the same. They no longer want us occupying their country and want us out, the sooner the better. And by the way, Iraq was NEVER a seat for terrorists, nor is it where Osama Bin Laden was or is - and please remember, he is the one who orchestrated 9/11 and the USS Cole bombing, the 1993 bombing of the WTC, among other atrocities.|`|aFC72tLZaa	They are heroes.  You should have seen his speach.  What he is not letting them know is how many troops will stay there.  He gave them a figure of 50,000.  Come on, don't be so dumb.   You republicans are sorelosers.  Did you actually want to elect an old man who admitted he had no knowledge of economics, and picked a former beauty queen as his VP?  Who didn't know the countries that make up North America? Their macsot was Joe the Plumber who talked about MCain behind his back.  I think the fact that Republicans are just sorelosers and their lack of intelligence is overwhelming.  Who is this Michael Steele guy?  He is really getting annoying.  He told the republican party to get their heads out of the sand.  Rush would be a better GOP leader.|`|8840f90d1236990da5c34043fc11245faa	Bush went to Iraq to get rid of Saddam the jobs done so why they hell are the soldiers still there.|`|bc31594d662102e5c53e9da54ca5195baa	Well. First of all: We're not pulling. We just pull the vast majority<br>  of combat troops. That doesn't mean we won't leave anyone behind.<br>  50k US troops (most of those actually combat units) is still quite<br>  some presence for a bunch of terrorists. We just sell it a bit more<br>  comfortable for everyone. The Iraqis need a perspective without US<br>  forces around the block and that's what we are giving them. Setting<br>  diffuse dates in a distant future just creates more mistrust if we ever<br>  plan to leave. Pulling the troops is a delicate thing that needs to be<br>  balanced carefully. Too many is wasted and not good for the local<br>  "moral" and too few is bad for Iraq's stability.|`|7idyT7Obaa	you're a retard, and perfect example of why people who have never been in OIF shouldnt be allowed to make any choices about it.<br>  where to start: iraq is full of insurgents, not terrorists. there is a difference.<br>  finishing the job? you mean getting iraq under control? that will NEVER happen, since they are people who have NOTHING except their radical religion and dont care if they win today or ten thousand years from now<br>  staying there is HURTING the us<br>  btw, here is a PERFECT example of how much 'hostility' is going on in baghdad right now<br>  <a href="http://minx.cc/?post=283568" rel="nofollow">http://minx.cc/?post=283568</a><br>  <br>  look at it this way. Say you're talking to someone and you tell them "the grass in japan is red" based off an opinion you gathered from watching the news, and they tell you "no its green, I was just there for 16 months"...dont you think that there is a 99.9% chance your wrong? now lets apply that to OIF: i was there, you werent. dont you think you're opinion of"finishing the job" "things we've done being reversed" and "obama treating the troops like losers" has a 99.9% chance of being wrong?<br>  as you said, people like me are "heroes and winners"...and last i checked, heroes and winners aren't wrong.|`|7n523JW1aa	You don't get it. In order for a central government in Iraq we are pulling out slowly and deligently. The reason it won't be until March 2010 is because the Coliation forces are still helping build a Central Goverment. Then by the time we leave Iraqi Government will be able to take care of themselves and handle the insurgents in Iraq.|`|vdInjvzXaa	First of all, I don't even know you....but god damn are you retarded?  Little thing called the Status of Forces agreement signed by our government and the Iraqi government, Months ago while George W.

Have a nice life.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	This "question" is so full of poor assumptions and outright incorrect information that it is not even worth answering.<br>  <br>  Here's a hint...only COMBAT troops will be leaving.  There will still be over 50,000 US troops in Iraq as well as US military bases.<br>  <br>  Check your information next time.|`|LXpQp7Hbaa	No, it isn't.  From a military objective point of view it is telling the enemy that if they will just wait until a particular date they can have the disputed objective for free.<br>  <br>  Getting out?  Okay!  <br>  <br>  Announcing the date ahead of time? <br>  <br>  Asinine!!!!!!!

In addition the main stream media supports all the Democrats lies, so people watch it on TV and say this must be true, the reporters wouldn't lie.|`|LhH6OYpXaa	You mean lies like "I was opposed to the Bridge to Nowhere" and "I fired Monegan because of a difference in views on finance"<br>  Those kind of lies?|`|RD05jXYwaa	it isn't a lie if you drink the coo laid.tmm|`|lLEOTZEsaa	Because he is a liberal.

Instead we laugh it off and take care of business.  What is more important?  Obama sat on a SCHOOL BOARD with Ayers or that he can help this country get back on track.  Listen to McCain and Palin.  Their whole campaign consists of bashing Obama.  Have you heard one single thing that they can do for you personally.  Well, I hear what Obama can do for me all the time and that is why he has my vote.<br>  <br>  BARACK THE VOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|R1eLAwCfaa	Actually I think he feels "compeled" to refute the ridiculous lies spread about him (although they don't really seem to bother him much) even though he knows, not so deep down, that most Americans aren't as naive/ intentionally ignorant as you  apparently are..|`|gLMhG9fVaa	if obama told the truth, we would find the truth about him and he doesnt want that cuase he has things to hide, he has sealed his college records .. and cant produce a birth certificate to oprove he's a citizen of the USA|`|d1a2d96d28c063a31c38d6ccbb050904aa	He lies because he is a politician...all of them do to get elected.|`|TtZhVhldaa	The same reason McCain does, and bush, and both Clinton's.

If not you're as dishonest as those you criticize.|`|1469c060bcbe727c457ec792ff3dc9b1aa	Have you people forgot that we live in a country that impeach people.If Obama do something wrong he can get impeach.some of you people are dumb as hell stick to the issues I am so tired of this McCain has 9 houses and 13 cars but it is nothing wrong with that He is friends with Liddy it is nothing wrong with that Sarah Palin husband belong to an anti american group but I guess it is nothing wrong with that.Her 17 year old daughter get pregnant out of wedlock nothing wrong with that.They can scream out kill him in a rally but it is nothing wrong with that McCain was part of keating five nothing wrong with that Palin abuse her power and of course there is nothing wrong with that Don't throw stone when that candidates you support don't have there sh*t together
v1zyfea5aa	First, to GDSP, I'm offended.  Second, the lib dems have kept AA in darkness since the Civil War.  Some are getting smarter.  <br>  <br>  Yes, and to all those who don't get it yet, the market always reacts and discounts news before you know about it, so the entire fall has been in anticipation of obama.  Now that he is in, it is accelerating.  If this man isn't impeached or better, declared ineligible quickly, then we will have disastrous results.|`|0k5aCj6Vaa	They can, but what on earth good will it do?  I'm sure the media and others will say it started before Obama, but it DID NOT start before the Democrats took control of Congress.|`|V4BaRBtnaa	No, Democrats told you Neocon numbskulls so, over and over again. The President is simply trying to fix the mess the Bush and his Neocon cabal created.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Sure- as soon as people start voting for them again- sometime after 2024 !!!  :)|`|c6eCojEhaa	As much as I disagree with Obama's plans at rampant spending and increased government programs, I hardly believe that the market's continued decline can be blamed on him and the Democratic party.  In case you didn't notice, the economy was steadily sinking long before Obama took office.<br>  <br>  So no, Conservatives should not start saying I told you so.  Especially since it was "so called" Conservatives that spent our government into a $10 trillion debt.  They really don't have a leg to stand on.  You can't be silent when Bush does it and then complain when Obama does the same thing.  <br>  <br>  So in conclusion, the nation and its people are screwed and have to ride this storm out thanks to government ineptitude and mismanagement from every direction.<br>  <br>  Next time vote Ron Paul.|`|jgRRsG8Daa	I should have thought that they are already saying that.But then throughout the world,in  every democratic country,it is almost as it is<br>  the opposition party's bounden duty to say "We told you so" to the <br>  electorate who dumped them.|`|aFC72tLZaa	Yeah, he really inherited a mess.  Wait, you think he did all this after 37 days?  If you do, I hope to meet you.  I never met a person from Jupiter before.|`|vjfdhhSDaa	Yes and no , I would like to say wholeheartedly yes but then i would be stooping to their level by saying ,Nah , nah , nah , na I told you so.|`|AA10320674	We already did they still don't get it there is no help for the blind|`|WTHTVJN6aa	Yes, indeed!!|`|r2JPcUN8aa	They can certainly say anything they want.  But that does not mean it is true or there is any basis to it.  And since the "conservatives" are now a regional party of southern white men, no one is listening anyway.  BTW what economist not anticommunist do you get this information from?
Iot11b2jaa	Barack Obama is a GQ man.|`|AA11963685	Wow.  Lots of sour grapes in the answers to this question aren't there? lol<br>  <br>  He's attractive, he's young, and he knows how to dress.  A triple threat for the cover of any magazine - now add "President-elect" to the mix.  It's a no-brainer.  We're going to see a lot of personal coverage of the Obamas, just like we did the Clintons, and the Kennedy's back when.  Americans like their image and there is no reason they shouldn't.<br>  <br>  Except for those sucking on those God awful sour grapes.  Maybe for them - not so much.|`|avlFGsMAaa	We voted for the Celebrity Barack Hussien Obama....  <br>  <br>  TMZ is on his trail... and all th at.. <br>  <br>  FUN TIMES AHEAD!|`|XRy6waLnaa	Obama looks like Abe Lincoln<br>  <br>  skinny as a rail with a big wart on his face<br>  <br>  yeah..he sure looks weird|`|Z9jtdw17aa	I didn't vote for him because he is a fashion icon. I voted for the policies and problem-solving style, for the advisors with whom he surrounded himself, and the tenor of his campaign.   I'm really really indifferent to his image on the cover of ANY magazine.<br>  <br>  Further, I think this question is misplaced.  It should be in fashion or journalism, rather than in elections.<br>  <br>  Now, with all THAT said, I think he usually looks presidential, as is appropriate.  I really appreciate Michelle Obama's sense of style.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Sounds like the media is trying to manufacture an image of Obama in movie "mythical" terms.  Not very good journalism. <br>   <br>  Where are  the criticisms and probing investigations looking for even tiny  inconsistencies and any possible corruption?  Isn't that what journalists are supposed to do?  Why did they suddenly stop doing it?<br>  <br>  Only two possibilities.  Either they will forever give Obama a free ride because they support him, meaning they will cover up any wrong he does and we'll never hear about it.  Or they are building him up so they can tear him down later and sell papers that way.<br>  <br>  I guess that the former is more likely than the latter.|`|dfG7DZ6yaa	I love it. Obama has a very beautiful face. I just love his sincerity that oozes out of him. He is the best president ever and yes Michelle must be very proud of him indeed. Obama is great.|`|n66Zq4Wiaa	HIs undeniable swagger merits the likes of a front page spot on GQ ... but he does seem to be on EVERY magazine I've peered at in the check-out lane ... lol ...

Lets just hope he can govern as well as he looks.|`|UBVDXsyuaa	wow like omg, I am like so impressed, not.|`|oIGOQDkSaa	He's not a GQ. They wanted to sell magazines.|`|Vk4A8TYraa	I thought it was my program from the Cleveland Zoo.|`|lYgBVmkraa	So he happens to be young enough and attractive enough to be on the cover of GQ.  This hasn't been true of a President since Kennedy.  Some presidents were attractive when they were young, such as Reagan, but were old enough to have lost their looks by the time they became President.  So, he's young enough and attractive enough, and GQ chose to put him on the cover.  And this should be held against him....why?|`|TnwHK2Icaa	i think its cool. but I was an Obama supporter throughout the election. plus he is one of the best looking presidents we've had, and one of the youngest |`|oq3rq2gcaa	President Obama Rox... I think its great like you|`|X52J2fvMaa	Congrats for him....I'm glad to see that all that money he got from his campaigning went towards something benifical.  |`|57HPxBKYaa	disgusting, no birth certificate, go back to chicago and your thugs.|`|FzbK0Prpaa	oh la la|`|DTIi41vraa	Who cares?|`|Q5I4Yi61aa	I didn't realize his ears were so big.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	His face sells magazines so you'll see him all over the place.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	He's absolutely gorgeous...a fine example of a handsome gentleman, which is what GQ is all about.

All the while, Bush was trying to put missile defense bases in Poland and the Czech Republic (their backyard)....Weird.

LOL|`|0eFSeap5aa	Do you have some reference that we might verify your claim?<br>  <br>  I find it unlikely that Putin would deliberately insult the incoming president of the U.S.  Putin is no fool and would like the US and Russia to have a good working relationship<br>  <br>  Phrases often don't translate well from one language to another.  This could be someone's misinterpretation.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I haven't heard that one, but I won't be surprised to hear many comments like that.  Some of the leaders we have icy relations with are going to be testing him.  I doubt Obama will show the backbone to quell such comments.|`|bTguVXMjaa	If it's true, Putin told us more about himself than he told us about Obama.

If only the tables were turned, right?  Don't get too butthurt though, Democrats can be just as hypocratic... which maybe means we are all a lot more similar than we think?<br>  <br>  Vladimir Putin did not say such a thing, that's something newsworthy, and theres no media that says he did.  If you google your phrase, the only relative thing that comes up is THIS topic.  Limp-wristed?  I mean really.

AA11867354	Depends on how much they look. <br>  <br>  They will have the same questions we ask as we read history. Sometimes we have to search for the truth as many will gloss it over. The common denominator among  scholars of history is that they regard the accounts as part  fiction handed down by various individuals. The usual questions raised by doubting scholars are: Might their beliefs have caused the writers of the history to embellish actual fact? Did the politics of the early people community cause them to edit or add to the' story? Which parts of the history are likely to be straight reporting rather than myth making?<br>  <br>  People raised in an atheistic or secularized society believe that most of history that we are handed—are book full of legends and myths. Still others are appalled by what they read and believe all of  it. History of bloodshed, oppression, disunity, and ungodly behavior. Such individuals see no reason for paying any attention to writings held sacred elsewhere Even now in different countries if you read their history books of say World War 1--you will see a difference in their view of who did what and the most  for what reasons -with just some universal  beliefs accepted. <br>  <br>  Some will talk Bush Down and some Up. Basic history taught in school will sidestep much as a rule usually (too conversely--like religion and evolution--many avoid most of it in schools).|`|50e4ff35eca1b414ab4d2b69cbd101fbaa	He will come out a lot better than most people think.

He is guilty of war crimes, illegal wiretapping and torture.  You see Republicans, you're just sorelosers.  The best one had to win.

HOWEVER--historians geerally take a different view than what we use regarding current/recent public figures. And it is NOT ideological or political.<br>  <br>  For example: most historians do not like NIxon--bt rank him as a fairly successful president. We do respect Hoover-but regardhim as a failure. Carter and Woodrow Wilson are admired as idealists--and viewed as lousy presidents.<br>  <br>  The common thread is results and outcomes. Woodrow Wilson was brilliant--but he couldn't work effectively with Congress to get his ideas implemented. Same with Carter insome ways. Nixon,on the other hand, got things done--and they worked. Same for FDR. He's considered among the most successful presidents becaus ehe was able to get results.<br>  <br>  By that standard--Bush is an abysmal failure. He did get theIraq war resolution--and it turned out he was flat wrong about Iraq being  a threat. His economic policies --well, you see theresults.  He failed to get rid of al-Caida. He did not get his plans for health-care, immigration,, or social security reformed implemented.<br>  <br>  That's how historians rate presidents: did they get things done and did those things work.  Not How, or why (much of the failure of Hoover's administration was NOT his fault). IF a president wants a thumbs up from historians--they get results or else. Bush didn't. Simple as that.|`|MOYZCFKyaa	The only reason the Bush Administration looked really really bad in office is because th media is so liberal. History will treat them well.

He is the President-Elect!  The country voted for him, and now everyone will have to accept him, regardless of whether or not you like the man or agree with his policies, there is no cause to bash him for reasons like he hasn't brought the troops home yet, or the dow plunged again. (both of which I have seen on here)  You don't have to like the man, or agree with his policies, but he has been elected, and it's time to put up or get out.  He is not Hitler, he is not the Gestapo, he is not a socialist.  Give him a little time to prove himself before you defile him.  Personally I am so thankful he has been elected, I think it was the only thing that could repair our standing in the world at all, but regardless of whether or not you agree with me nobody has any right to bash him about things he has no control over.  If you disagree with his policies, that's different.  But can't we all give the man a chance?  YES!!

The people who come up with it are simply ignorant of how their own government works.|`|a9fm2ozMaa	16th amendment to the constitution: The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration.|`|XeF4PO6baa	There is no law.  And yes, imprisonment without charge is illegal.  Technically, the IRS isn't even a government agency.  But when the cops come to your door to arrest you for tax evasion, see if they care about any of that.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	There is no law like that. But, unless you want to be in jail-you pay. Remember, the gov't is king and we are peasants and have no rights. Look up Ruby Ridge and Waco-the FBI came packin' for them and shot them dead...so we pay taxes quietly and keep our mouths shut. yikes!|`|K2ecmzInaa	The Constitution says that the Legislative branch has the power to levy tax.

It's this way every election. Both sides. Every single time. You want the truth? I think this year has actually been pretty quiet compared to some I've seen. But this is just the nature of the beast. The smart voters are the ones that are not party members and can look past the b.s. and mudslinging to see what the candidates feel about the issues, and nothing more. |`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Yes it is. We all (myself included) want to believe that we live in the most extraordinary of times, but careful studies of history show our problems are not new. I think the reason we believe that it is so much worse now than in the past is due to expanded access to information. As technology advances so to does access to others. By being exposed to almost an overload of opinion it gives the impression that people have become more virulent when in reality it has always been this way regarding certain subjects like politics and religion..|`|trMsK86jaa	No.<br>  <br>  Anger leads to hate, and hatred is by no means normal.<br>  <br>  *watches people accept anger and hatred as normality*<br>  <br>  Well, i've lost - you've all been brainwashed into accepting the engineered status quo.<br>  <br>  Congratulations.|`|0RvtrkYOaa	I think it's been slightly friendlier between the two candidates this year.  However the radical left liberals and right conservatives need to go.|`|VlOr2IUTaa	From my perspective, I think that this election is a bit more aggressive and dirty than past elections.  The fault does not rest on the shoulders of one party in particular.  You can say that Obama is friendly and playing nice, but your kidding yourself.  McCain is attempting to fight just as dirty, he just sucks at it so it is more obvious.  They are both playing dirty, don't kid yourself.  <br>  <br>  What is surprising to me is that the general population is so caught up in supporting their candidate, I have seen more hate speech and hate crimes arise out of this election (on both sides).  Even look on Yahoo Answers.  Both sides are calling the other side morons, ignorant, or stupid.  Why?  Can't we have a difference in opinion without name calling or pointing fingers?  <br>  <br>  I don't agree with either candidate. I don't think that either one will do a good job as president.  Consequently, I am voting 3rd party for the first time in my life.

In might take over a decade of intelligent leadership - a.k.a, Obama and the like, for the people to come together again. |`|6L1YwoWdaa	Yes it is.

Plus, it takes weeks to get everyone up to speed so they know everything that is going on in the world when the two administrations pass the power between them.  It's a fairly lengthy, complicated process to assume presidential power, and definitely not an easy thing for a person to do.  One missed detail could literally mean that people die, especially when we have soldiers keeping the peace overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|KTM5JEkLaa	Because the 20th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution establishes the date of the inauguration as noon on January 20th.  This moved it back from March 4th, which gave plenty of time to count ballots and cast the electoral votes, which became less needed due to advances in voting.

Vrs3mid6aa	First off, just so you know, the only legal recourse this guy has is to take your boyfriend to small claims court and prove his case. <br>  <br>  Have his boss call the cops to issue a citation for criminal trespass, that way the next time he comes to his job, he will immediately be arrested. Go to court and file a no contact order, in the paperwork, he will need to explain the harrassment, threats and why he feels his life is threatened. That will not be hard since the guy is basically insinuating he will use the gun against him. Once the no contact order is filed, they will both have to appear in court, and your boyfriend will need to prove his case. DO NOT LET HIM SKIMP ON THE DETAILS! Bottom line, it doesnt matter if he is being serious, he's made threats of deadly force, which qualifies this as a serious situation. Don't let him shrug it off, I'm telling you from experience, these situations are nothing to play with.|`|KBRCOa6vaa	Contact the police they may have an officer contact him, this may scare the guy off. It could piss him off more though, I'm guessing he's not serious.

Watch out for poison oak, sumac and ivy though or nature will have it's revenge.  This is really one of the most dumbest (no a single would not work on this one) ones I have heard but I am sure that the UN will get involved, they will add it as a supplement to the Kyoto accords and then the EPA will do a ruling that we can't wipe without twenty copies of a form made from trees they kill to save the environment.

When are people going to understand that marriage is about love and not gender? They claim to protect the "sanctity of marriage" but honestly some couples take longer to divorce than they last as a married couple (ie Britney Spears 24 hour marriage). Then you have people that say "oh then why can't I marry my dog I love my dog too!" (this is probably the dumbest excuse yet).

It is referenced in the Bible, and it is also cited as one of the possible downfalls of the Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  Today the societal norms have come to accept homosexuality as somewhat normal even though a large portion of the population still considers it and abnormal behavior. <br>  <br>  However, through a well organized campaign through education and mass media, people who have the nerve to express their opposing views on homosexuality are branded as homophobes and bigots. <br>  <br>  The next to follow will be the societal acceptance of sex with minors.  An organization called NAMBLA (National Man Boy Love Association) has been in operation for years and exists for the sole purpose of legalizing sex with minors based on mutual consent even though the minor in question may not be emotionally mature enough to understand the consequences of consent.<br>  <br>  Now many of you may think that would never happen, and are appalled at the thought of grown people having sex with minors but just remember, homosexuality was viewed in the same light only 50 years ago.<br>  <br>  So all of you kids in your 20's who think homosexuality is normal, remember your stance today when people want to start having sex with your grandchildren.|`|UXKMNkdgaa	Because most people think they are sick freaks.|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Because right-wing religious nuts have invested tons of money to assure that this will never happen.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	Because a 2000 year old collection of books doesn't mention the idea of one man marrying another man.|`|r6JskEtxaa	Because the bible said no.

If a baby is still alive after an abortion he voted in his state that you are allowed leave him/her alone on the table to die.  He said not doing so would endanger abortion rights because you would otherwise be admitting that the baby is a person.<br>  <br>  He also has said he will appeal the partial-birth abortion ban as soon as he gets into office.   The procedure is the killing of a baby after birth is enduced and the baby is beginning to exit his/her mother. <br>  <br>  Finally, Obama is praised by NARAL.|`|TYW2OQM5aa	He's pro-death.  <br>  <br>  You can call it pro-choice but society has just coined that term to make it an easier thing to support. <br>  The reason we're ok with calling it pro-life is because you know that if you don't kill it, a life is what you will get. <br>  I guess you could go with anti-choice, but then you'd have to ask which person doesn't get the choice, the one waiting to be born or the one that already has. <br>  <br>  |`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	obama is PRO-ABORTION.  To an extreme.  His beliefs on abortion are even too radical for most democrats.  He voted AGAINST the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act in Illinois which would have given babies born "accidentally" as a result of a botched abortion basic human rights.  The babies are taken to linen closets to "finish" dying alone in a HOSPITAL where they could be saved, but you see, they're not supposed to have lived anyway so they just let them die.  He voted against a bill that would have required to doctors to preform life-saving procedures on these babies.  He wouldn't even call them babies.  He uses the term "pre-viable fetus".  Which the baby cannot actually be because the definition of a fetus is a developing mammal or other viviparous vertebrate, after the embryonic stage and BEFORE birth. |`|fs41Tho8aa	Pro choice,,he has never flip floped about this issue..unlike McCain who wanted to make a the health of the Mother exception to the GOP platform in June but decided to go against his own words as displayed in the 3rd debate|`|7ccf6629153f5dc1724e3cd5d9ff7194aa	Choice..and you should thank goodness he is going to win, because Mac and Palin are for the reproductive rights....of Rapists.! You would not be able to decide if you wanted the rapists child, you WILL be forced to bring it to term.|`|mGZCXPbTaa	Obama is Pro-Choice but follows the same idea that Bill Clinton voiced and many dems believe...Abortion should be legal and RARE.|`|dA4gShdVaa	He is pro-choice.   You should never vote for someone based on one issue though...especially this one since Roe v. Wade won't be overturned anyway.  It's really almost a non issue.|`|VtXvmOIXaa	He is pro-choice............which does not mean pro-abortion which is the way republicans like to spin it.|`|b70cNqyqaa	Obama is pro life. YOUR life. <br>  Also consider this: If you find yourself  with an unwanted pregnancy, you have a CHOICE of wether or not to terminate the baby's life. <br>  That makes YOU a killer, not the Supreme Court. YOU don't have to kill your baby. Remember, there are other options.<br>  Have the baby, give it up for adoption ; just say no, birth control methods, waiting until wanting to start a family, not having an affair with some other man when you're married, not having sex with a man who is already married and just plain raising the baby, like a responsible person . <br>  <br>  There is an ugly smear campaign going on in America, so be careful, check the facts,|`|AGssYf9Gaa	I believe he is pro-choice...up to a point. I think he said something about after a certain time period(of pregnancy) that he would not agree with it being a choice.<br>  Here is a link for you..|`|ntFwCIcKaa	He's a democrat so that makes him pro-choice. period.<br>  <br>  In fact, he fought against legislation which protected babies that actually SURVIVED late term abortions. nice.|`|jrdtQi04aa	He is pro choice.  He is also pro education to try to stop kids from getting pregnant in the first place.  |`|AFqZEOlRaa	He's pro-choice.  He would like to cut down on abortions by increasing education about pregnancy and how you get there and make birth control pills available to more women who need them, as opposed to McCain who wants insurance companies to pay for Viagra but not birth control pills.  <br>  <br>  And ignore all the rants you will get about him voting against protecting babies born alive after an abortion.  If you check it out, you'll see that that law was already on the books, but some people were wanting to take away the provision for abortion in case of danger to the mother.|`|AA11284831	He supports a woman's right to choose.  He does not believe that abortion should be the first or only way to deal with unwanted pregnancies, but feels that prevention of unwanted pregnancy is far preferable to abortion in all cases.  He supports common sense education and easy availability of birth control to prevent the spread of disease and unwanted pregnancy.
7n523JW1aa	Nope. I was deployed first to Camp Pendelton then to good ol' Iraq|`|6PBGAp7Raa	being deployed means you are in country somewhere else, like iraq or afghanistan. you would be stationed at a military base. not deployed unless it is in a foreign country and you are on a tour of duty.|`|JIwbiE8kaa	I am currently deployed...and from San Antonio, Texas.  My family is there.  I am an Intelligence officer and I love my job.  Being deployed is not as bad as you think, it comes down to having a supportive family.  This is not my first deployment.|`|k76mr7rKaa	I think you have your terminology wrong...<br>  <br>  You might be thinking of being stationed in San Antonio, TX.<br>  <br>  Best I can remember the last ones deployed there was while Mexico and the US of A were at war...
4v1keWo1aa	I don't have time to ponder that right now.  Got to go to eBay and get me some of those Sarah Palin outfits--she did say they were gonna sell them there, didn't she?|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	No.  Sarah actually energized his base.<br>  <br>  What brought McCain down was the fact we are in a tough economy right now and his party was occupying the white house.  He was unable to distinguish himself enough from Bush.|`|naMQOSv7aa	Yeah because They All Think McCain would've died and we'd have The Alaska Lady for president.<br>  And she can see Russia from her house...|`|AA11828439	The hammer.|`|AA10329269	I don't really think so. I think initially she helped bring some excitement to the campaign - which it was totally lacking before. But her presence alone (and bad interviews) couldn't keep the momentum going. McCain is just a terrible campaigner. And it doesn't help that his ideals are iffy.|`|bMiMBc1haa	No, I wouldn't have voted for McCain anyhow.  He spent too much time saying he supported the Pres and the country was going in the right direction.  Then once he was in the running for the GOP nomination, he changed his tune.  Nope, I would gave voted for my stupid cat before I voted for him.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Palin...nail...I'm sorry, I started thinking about something else.|`|mjBtGTyUaa	No, Sarah Palin was not what brought down the Republican ticket and it's despicable that some Republicans are now turning her into a scapegoat.  ANY Republican would have had a hard time this election cycle because of Bush's strong negative numbers.  Throw the economic fiasco into the mix and people were just itching to blame the Republicans for that, too.  Sarah Palin was outside the fray of Washington politics so there's no way she can be blamed for any of this...the Republicans did themselves in.|`|VgOCLskYaa	I'll bet you were an Obama supporter and would have voted for McCain if he had not selected Palen. NOT|`|da497b496d860db69805aee850404dcdaa	It was a "landslide"  in terms of electoral votes which is deceiving.<br>  Much, much closer in popular vote terms.<br>  <br>  Palin was such a poor choice, she did nothing but hurt McCain. McCain would have had a much better chance with someone more qualified and distinguished.|`|9op65iQVaa	I was all for Obama all the way....but, I can see that she drowned him.  It would have been a closer Race but......She sucked!!!|`|ZAgzt0DWaa	You betcha!|`|Wv592rOqaa	Yup! x's 10|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Obama won for one reason<br>  <br>  He was not a republican<br>  <br>  This election was a no win situation for the Republicans|`|Ue7MCJhqaa	Partly but she will be used as scapegoat..The current Prez is the real nail in the coffin but of course their party is not going to admit it...|`|yd2SP7d6aa	I don't think so but neither did she really help.  The Republican party put up some turds as candidates this year and given the economic conditions, Iraq situation (with the blame always following on the party that controls the Presidency), it was amazing he did as well as he did.  <br>  <br>  Just as the Dems were as spiteful as they could be to tear down Bush's approval rating, expect a similiar tactic.  If Iran is allowed to build a nuclear faciility, expect Republicans to nail Obama to the wall.  If gas prices / energy soars under the Obama administration the Republicans will nail him to the wall.  If Obama tries to bring Universal Healthcare to Americans and the middle class get 'taxed' to pay for, expect Republicans did nail him to the wall.  Good times ahead Dem's.|`|ZEpHcke7aa	You wish, without Sarah he would have been lucky to win his own state. She'll be back. <br>  SARAH 2012, first woman POTUS!|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	No it was not. This election would have been an uphill battle for any Republican candidate. The simple fact is that majority sentiment was just not on their side in this election from the start. The biggest drag on the Republican ticket was not Palin. It was McCain.|`|TqiR4lZlaa	You betcha|`|18I6loFTaa	Yes but like you said ,America didn't want any more of the McSame!<br>  New Tax on healthcare?<br>  Giving tax breaks to companies that leave America ?<br>  And call Americans that lose there jobs overseas , Whiners?<br>  <br>  And a special thanks to Hillary because if not for these people we would not have a President Obama today!!!!|`|0ZAFuyATaa	yes what a idiot |`|DC4Civrvaa	Yes I do.  In the beginning I thought that because she was a woman and Hillary was out that it would help him get those women voters who were looking forward to seeing Hillary.  But boy was I wrong.  The next day after news got out that she was his VP oh lord it was all downhill from there.|`|5e7ce1410439b59df8ff094631f563a1aa	yes...|`|6c9CyuX9aa	It's possible....there are folks who just would not have been comfortable with a woman in that particular office.  Lokk how they reacted to Geraldine Ferraro.  You may be too young to remember her but I think Margaret Chase Smith would have made a heck of a President!!!|`|c6848eb483a5f1ebce26d98a8f25be32aa	yes|`|11UkwCyHaa	Not at all.  If it wasn't for Palin much of the Evangelical Right would have stayed home.<br>  <br>  The "nail in the coffin" was the stock market crash and the economic crisis.<br>  <br>  j|`|8847b47570a9b24b6cc112fba95a52e3aa	McCain won the womens vote. Palin took a left leaning must disliked McCain and got the Conservative base out to vote for him. Lefties are clueless.|`|6hl64WCpaa	Yes, Apparently they thought that we Hillary supporters only supported her because she was female.  They did not give us a qualified woman to rally behind.  She was a huge joke.|`|etKzA9lKaa	yes i do, if mccain could relate to moderates he would have done alot better especially with hillary supporters!|`|3CkLZTVLaa	Possibly.  The fact that he's Republican didn't help either.  He's from the same tree as Bush/Cheney.|`|PO0RdP4baa	If McCain went and hired someone like Bloomberg, then I probably would've considered voting for him.  The fact he made such an obvious political hiring to pander to the evangelical right was such a turn off.  Palin is a joke, and judging from internal Republican party discussions, they hated her as well.|`|FYdKoA4Paa	i think it was Joe the Plumber butt.|`|LzJMaw2Iaa	Yes and no.  My boyfriend's sister lives in Alaska and there are a lot of people that are upset because the rest of the country failed to acknowledge ANY of the good she's done as governor choosing instead to focus on all the reasons she's make a bad VP.  Not that people were going around making up all kinds of horrible things about her, they simply chose to focus on all the negative stuff.  And McCain let them.<br>  <br>  Everyone kept talking about why she shouldn't be VP and McCain showed on interest in discussing with she should.|`|pHKwvQzAaa	It was not a landslide first of all...second, no she didnt bring him down. Most undecided voters are women. When Hilary Clinton was running, the Democrats had the support of most women voters. When she dropped outta the race, the women were undecided and Palin got the womens votes.<br>  By the way...Palin is a real person with a real family. That is who we need...who the hell is Joe Biden? He wasnt even talked about...he was just "The white man running for Obama's VP"|`|ijCyszbVaa	Pailin was the nail in.|`|ilsHl34faa	It was for me, if he had picked Mitt Romney, he would have had my vote, and I'm sure a lot more votes as well.|`|UhJmR3bYaa	The real nail in the coffin was when the economy and wall street started to melt down, McCain's response was "The fundamentals of our economy are sound." That's not the kind of response people want to hear when they're losing their jobs, homes and bank accounts.|`|VWXXmL74aa	Yeah she ruined him|`|AA11326235	Yes.  It took away McCain's claim of being a maverick and showed him to be pandering to the evangelical base and disenchanted Hillary supporters.  If he had picked Pawlenty and ran a more positive campaign he would have made the election much closer and perhaps won.|`|srJD56noaa	It wasn't a land slide by no means yes he got more electoral votes but if you look at the numbers each state was like 50 / 50 almost so he barely won most states expect for the typical blue states<br>  <br>  I do however think Sarah Palin was a poor choice for VP|`|kAyF2fm0aa	yes. I couldn't fully support Obama or McCain. But McCain was a little closer for my Christian values. But when he put Palin on the ticket, it was over.|`|DGKaMDmdaa	I think McCain would have won had he not been with Sarah Palin, there was too much controversy around her, it took away from his political campaign. |`|dbf34ff38c532999837d513078fa22d0aa	Sarah Palin is 10 times more qualified than Obama to be president.<br>  <br>  Nice try, though, you've been watching too much SNL.|`|Jn4FkMRmaa	Bush was, I think Palin helped the ticket do as good as it did.|`|jsCe1eHgaa	Yes, absolutely.

Just the opposite.|`|YQjTSpXOaa	I don't think so that he is fit to lead, cause he as been tortured in prison, & sometimes that reflects on the mind, & he tends to be foggy<br>  & underachiever, so I don't think he will be fit that's why he picked the running mate.|`|lJHVi1J4aa	Yes, I do.  As Joe Biden said during the primaries about Obama,"The presidency is not something that lends itself to on-the-job training."|`|4XQw0oT4aa	no...he chose Palin for his vp|`|qnURfWqdaa	yes.....|`|0wdEcNk1aa	The thing I see is a man who might not even be able to survive the stress of a presidency in these times. That would leave Palin as our president. What an abhorent thought!|`|a2V6lK04aa	He seemed very short-tempered. The biggest thing that worries me about John is his age and I'm just going to flat out and honest, I wouldn't feel comfortable at all with Sarah Palin taking over as president.|`|b538976641cc2a50041772f307796f66aa	At least the people who voted for him in Republican Presidential elections do. |`|v6WHh9POaa	He is not fit to lead a line of seniors to IHOP.|`|zXq4NYXvaa	McCain is a hothead and his policies suck!|`|HOTDwmEoaa	Lead what?

Barrak lacks with hardly any experience. We need a wise leader not someone who just happens to be able to give a good speech. John is a veteran and has a good grip on foreign policy where as Barrak does not. Who really believes that Obama will be able to cut taxes for 95% of the poeple anyway. Also if Obama wins and insittutes his new healthcare program that will be a major step in moving our goverment to becoming more socialist.|`|KjqGgJmvaa	Very much screwed. McCain is proposing the same crap Bush proposed which got our economy screwed up in the first place. It's time for a change. Stop with the old hags. I believe Obama can actually make America a better place.|`|pTBhq0rHaa	no he is not. He is another Bush, and look how far he has gotten us. Further in debt. We are boderline for depression.

And a lier. His wife could not trust him so why should I? I hated the stupid looks he gave Oboma during last nights debate. I don't think he is of good character. I think is is childish and a lier. I so hope Oboma wins. It is time for a change. And Oboma is fighting for us "the little guys" that pays our government wages. GO Oboma and win the election. You will do for us. |`|hJuJj9lKaa	Yes, I think he is fit to lead; Palin is just as fit to lead as Obama.|`|eYgmCRKoaa	Yes.

I am sure there are many more skeletons in his closet that Daddy covered for him. |`|BBhFuhbaaa	He does'nt have to.<br>  W's wife killed her ex- boyfriend with her car. Nobody cares about that|`|W6QGI5qYaa	This is even more irrelevant than Dems claim Bill Ayers is.|`|0xvCm0B1aa	Who cares?|`|e52Wy71Laa	Someone is wrong on the Internet!<br>  <br>  * Michelle Obama's thesis has been released.<br>  <br>  * Hawaii's (GOP) governor (who spoke at the RNC praising Sarah Palin) did not order Obama's birth record to be sealed.<br>  <br>  * LA Times has said why they won't release the tape: the source only showed it to them on the condition that they not release it.  If it's a coverup, they botched it horribly -- they PUBLISHED THE STORY.  And if you believe the story they wrote, why don't you believe them when they say why they won't release the tape?<br>  <br>  * Ted Kennedy was in a car crash that killed a woman, and he handled it very badly. In 1969.  So no, I won't be voting for him for president in 2008.|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Don't forget about all the planes he crashed because he was "irresponsible" and "aggressive".  |`|0Y6CqSliaa	If you injured or killed someone in an accident would you like to remember it every day? I would feel so guilty if i did that, that i would just never talk again.|`|K6KeN7sgaa	To the first responder - There's no "cover up" by Ted Kennedy -- the poor man has been crucified DAILY for the past frikking 40 freaking YEARS by the Screaming Reichtwingers. Crucified for an ACCIDENT which he has dealt with on a personal level every single day.<br>  <br>   "Cover up?" Gimme a GD break.<br>  <br>  And to answer the question - it's been covered up because McCain is receiving special treatment. Which is totally BOGUS.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah - and what the other poster just said. "Ted Kennedy is not running for President."|`|UQlfW4sAaa	Because that's all the Republicans are good at; covering up things. Just look at the record of G.W. Bush. <br>  <br>  Oh, and btw; Ted Kennedy is not running for president!! |`|LqnRc6p6aa	he's doin a great job, im too lazy to read all you typed, and i'm too lazy to click on the link, so as far as i'm concerned he's covered up the crash brilliantly.|`|iWLeHnlnaa	Another good reason not to trust the guy!|`|YRrGv82Zaa	Oh yes we are being duped by all our senators.<br>  The scoundrels the whole lot of 'em.<br>  <br>  Oh we are in perilous times! Save us !<br>  <br>  Oh get a grip.........McCain is not covering up.. The Navy refuses to release the info as it does not fit the guidelines necessary for emergencies or of value as a story...<br>  <br>  We live in a litigious society. So lawsuits are always on the table.. <br>  Stop insulting the Navy.|`|AA10251487	All you have is a wreck from 1964?  <br>  <br>  Speaking of cover up, why isn't the LA Times releasing the video of Barak toasting the PLO operative?  Things that make you go hmmmmm!|`|AMTYPir7aa	maybe because obama has decided to seal all of his records from forever and refuses to show his birth certificate. sounds ok to me all fair in love and war.|`|8po0AtQBaa	Heck, the man couldn't fly a plane without crashing it.  What would be the difference with a car.|`|lMR4PpATaa	Maybe he should get some advice from Obama.  He seem to be an expert at cover-ups.|`|Fmt0ZWlbaa	McSame<br>  <br>  same with Bush and the death of a black girlfriend|`|o7WAplhBaa	car crash?<br>  ayers? Wright?<br>  you choose|`|Fx2lB9LYaa	because it is all he knows covering up things
4iAMrHd1aa	Here's what Obama was thinking:<br>  <br>  "Oh CRAP!  Now they will expect results!"<br>  <br>  |`|AA11775891	He had just lost his grandmother the day before! That's one reason..another reason is that he was probably TIRED. He had been campaigning every day & traveling so much. He was even compaigning the same day of  the election. It had been a long day for him!<br>  <br>  Glad he won, but he needs prayer for the large task ahead.|`|AA11529840	Better question... Why did Obama choose Rahm Emanuel for White House Chief of Staff?  <br>  <br>  Dude is a Clinton crony from back in Chi-town.  Glad to see Obama's bringing his boys too.|`|be11cb96baef392bd3e54edba808e5e6aa	Uhh......his grandmother who helped practically raise him just died before she got to see him become president....I'd be a bit sad too.|`|mIO4q7Nsaa	Exhausted, and thinking of the exhaustion to come.|`|rnq9p4bKaa	A light appeared & shined on his face & he realized he's just not up to the job!|`|quUiaHeSaa	His grandmother passed away the other day|`|9BeUbORtaa	Perhaps less sullen than exhausted. |`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	Could be that his grandmother died the day before, and none of his family (besides wife and kids) were alive to see his historic win.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	So someone else noticed that too.  I immediately thought he had a twinge of conscience - looking at the adoring crowd and knowing that there is absolutely no way he will be able to make good on his promises....that they've been duped, and that his agenda is something completely different from what they expect.<br>  <br>  Giving him the benefit of the doubt, however, he could have been thinking about how his grandmother didn't live to see this.  In either case, the above statement about his agenda remains true.|`|AA11166769	Actually, he looked quite happy. Perhaps you're mistaking his look of dignity with a look of sullenness.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	I think what you saw was exhaustion mixed in with relief.  Then you also have the potential worry over his future.  |`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	sullen?  I don't think he did.  Just because he wasn't grinning from ear to ear doesn't mean he was "sullen".|`|tkX8VMDSaa	Being a Nurse I could clearly read his face. How much he would have loved the share this moment with his beloved Grandmother. At least she saw some of his tremendous successes.<br>  <br>  His Grandparents must have had enormous strength to raise him during such ugly times in our country.<br>  <br>  He was the Orphan among the attendees. Michelle had her Mom, Joe Biden his.  <br>  <br>  Even McCain still has his Mom. <br>  <br>  |`|to5BW9Apaa	sullen? the man looked wore to the bone. they had to be tired after all the cross country campaigning they did in the last week. plus it was after midnight...AND his grandmother just died before he reached the pinnacle of american politics. what a great moment for him and america. too bad she missed it.|`|c3vPZfghaa	Just realized that he now has to deal with Bush-recession.<br>  Throw that on top of a death in the family, and it might not make someone such a happy camper.|`|1RTwcBXraa	Probably cuz his wife had been on his case for not noticing that awful ugly dress she had on lol!|`|Wucoda6taa	Because he knows he won't be able to fix this economy.|`|AA10091004	THINK ABOUT IT. <br>  HIS GRANDMOTHER JUST DIED AND WASN'T ABLE TO SEE HIM WIN. WOULDN'T YOU BE SAD TOO?|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Tired from all the campaigning.|`|AA12306514	He knows he didn't really EARN the position. 
Wv592rOqaa	I agree with you.  I do not think McCain wanted to win this race and if he did why of all the qualified females would he go literally dig out Palin? Even conservative folks who wanted to vote for McCain changed their minds.  <br>  <br>  Oh well this is probably the best public paid ride she will ever experience.  |`|XyN99Pizaa	i think your right...it didnt seem like he gave it his all..maybe he knew that he wasnt gonna win...who knows...but i hope he retires too and enjoys the rest of him life with his wife and kids!!!|`|5e7ce1410439b59df8ff094631f563a1aa	I think he was tired and worn out from all the negative campaigning, so he just wanted it to be over...|`|AA11348933	I think he did.|`|3tuwWidiaa	I think he did, but I think he never found someone (like Rove) that knew how to get him there.|`|7168489851f4e0697aa6485de16a2551aa	I think McCain did want to be President, but once again his party's leaders hung him out to dry. I think if McCain wouldn't have picked Palin and would've been himself instead of what the Republicans wanted him to be he would have done far better. He fell into the same trap Hillary did by trying to listen to too many people and trying to appease what he thought his supporters wanted instead of sticking to himself.  I am still not sure he could have beat Obama but I think he would have had better results.|`|Tue5oCljaa	I think he did.  Any of these people that ran had to be heartbroken when their campaign came to an end.  The disrespect some of them were shown for running when their campaigns faded was horrible.  It took a lot to pour your heart into something for so long, and then have to let it go.  I hated to see some of animosity that people had to show every time a candidate dropped out.  If any of you saw CNN run that piece on "I had a bad day" after the primaries you know what I mean.  I was floored.  That was one of the tackiest things that could have come from a  major network.|`|4J6PDbdOaa	If he ran his campaign like he gave his concession speech, he would have won. Sadly he had to go negative and dirty, and it really backfired on him|`|ofliWHcmaa	at first but after a while he got frustrated he is really old anyway he did a ok job he's just partly 2 old and should go back and stick with his other job|`|4614168d116b773eafe0008b34f0822aaa	Of course he did. He hit 7 states campaigning on Monday. He wouldn't have done that if he was old and tired. |`|Ih9tjTXTaa	i totally agree|`|RKHHvVNFaa	I agree, Palin scares me! <br>  Hey, it is what it is. <br>  OBAMA 08<br>  YES WE DID!|`|C4QlKukUaa	I think he did, but he tried to run using the Bush Playbook, when that didn't work, he borrowed Hilliary's, when that didn't work,  used Sean Hannities tired stupid script, when that didn't work, he thought he get himself a Hillary wannabe, when that didn't work we  tried to establish a fake real people connection, using Joe the Plumber as his "Role Model",<br>  was he serious??  Who the heck wants to be the "Joe the Plumber" average guy?  <br>  <br>  It was the silliest campaign I have ever seen or heard of. Which he could take Sean Insanity and Bill O'liar with him wherever he goes out of the public view.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think he wanted to be president, but he wanted it in the wrong ways.  He is nearing the end of his career, and I think he was looking at two things.  The first is maintaining Republican power, and the 2nd was getting to a coveted position at his age.  He knew that this was his last change to reach the presidency.  But what he didn't realize was that his mistakes such as picking Palin and running smear ads was not the way to do it.  He lacked integrity.  Had he picked a different VP, and run ads with more purpose rather than negative means, then maybe he would have won.  But also remember Bush was part of the problem.  When your current president does poorly in office the last 8 years, many will be frustrated and likely turn to the other candidate.  So I think he wanted to win, but he didn't want to do it with the right attitude and it showed. 
bmWNArhkaa	OOBBBBBAAAMAMMMAA BATTTCHH :D|`|UFfsdHbyaa	I believe MCCAIN will win.|`|13sJZdacaa	i think Obama (*fingers crossed*)<br>  and why did you say "don't say who ever you're voting for"...but then put that you're voting for McCain??<br>  well in that case.....<br>  OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA OBAMA<br>  :)|`|H46nNTOOaa	Obama
AA10164318	Fox has quit feeding it's live programming to the news feeders.  <br>  <br>  This is not the first time they have been caught.  They were caught planning their coverage of the 2004 Republican convention with the organizers, to play down some people and play up others.|`|XdFFUeK8aa	Here is empirical proof that Fox is not objective. After each of the presidential debates, they had a text-in poll to ask viewers who won. Each time, it was McCain 80% - 90%. Say what you will about McCain, that is obviously an extremely unrepresentative sampling. And there is no possible reason for that except that Fox is putting out material that appeals primarily to Republicans or conservatives.|`|hcWlWhCIaa	Messy that is not what this guy is saying. <br>  <br>  All media is biased to a certain degree. Fox isn't innocent. Niether is CNN or MSNBC. Watch C-span if you want non-biased.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Rasmussen did a study earlier in the year when compared media coverage.  Fox came up with the best results as least biased.  MSNBC was worst.  CNN somewhere between them.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|182UIiCwaa	FOX Leans to the right, MSNC, ABC, NBC, NY times, and some others they are anchored to the left. See the difference. FOX lets peopl come on have a honest conversation on both sides. The will ask hard questions of Republicans. When the dems show up on the other networks it is always so whats your favorite cake, did you go to a movie recently. What is it like when you go grocery shopping. See the difference. Sean Hannity had McCain on a couple of times and every time he asked some hard questions about his policies. McCain/Finegold, Mccain/Kennedy. This is why Right wing talk radio does so well the ask real questions and entertain us with the facts. Liberal radio can't do that. That is also why liberal radio will never debate with Conservative radio cause they can't debate. They have no facts about what they like and most of the time they are wrong and history will prove that.|`|ba5ed5efc0a430ba83c52b6ed0224188aa	  I have proff that other station make Obama look better.  They play all of his sound bites without editing them.  Unfair to fox news because without editing they are shown to be unbalanced.<br>    You forgot to show how fox leave out parts of a show to prove their points like how they said nobody could find out about Obama's college years when in fact he was president of harvard review as their first president.  He also hanged out with the conservative crowd in college not radicals.  Opps|`|PPVd25fDaa	FOX leans to the right, but MSNBC is the longest running leftist infomercial in history.  |`|01tUiAEVaa	wow! look at poll numbers! 40% negative coverage of each candidate!|`|qWNcOhJJaa	Go to the PEW research center and you'll have the proof you need|`|t3QAaSN9aa	I don't think Fox even really tries to hide its bias, despite their "fair and balanced" nonsense.  They have staked out their targeted demographic and they gear their appeal to right-wingers.  It has served them well.|`|YkZeA3Jvaa	Look at Fox News as equal time for Conservatives against all the rest of the television networks, which don't even hide their liberal bent on things.
z6OePRCMaa	Put a whole lot of mysterious nonsense out there just to keep them busy and drive them crazy and tie them up chasing after nothing.  Would actually be kind of fun.  Spy away people!

After that, when I am finish with my business I would come up and go to that person and ask them what they want. I don't want this problem to get bigger and try to tell my parents about it. First of all when parents get involve with kind of interaction their mouths can't stop and they will keep their mouths open and try to make a long speech or a sermon then after-wards they'll make it even longer. So my advice is just try to solve in your own positive very ethical knowledgable person. You know what to do, you what's right and bad thing to do. |`|ZmDOvzJWaa	I would be really annoyed and i would tell my parents and talk to the person who was spying on me and ask them why they are doing it and tell them to stop!|`|ZfryRB7laa	We are all spied upon, haven't you ever heard, Big Brother is Watching You.

There must be a reason why they don't if they are TOO LAZY then more than likely they were TOO LAZY to actually make a good decision on who to vote for.

Obama and Biden still have the moral high ground.|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	It may be on par, but I'm voting McCain/Palin and was OUTRAGED at a plot to kill obama.

And maybe Fox News looks like it's giving it alot of attention when you compare it to the Liberal Media (CNN, CBS, ect) who give things like this NO time.  |`|lklwmGh6aa	I think either one is horrible.  This election has been scary.  The amount of hate and violence that people have expressed is surprising.  I can understand being passionate, but there is a huge difference.

Joking about death certainly isn't the same as planning murder, so I suppose that planning murder is worse and I would agree with your assessment.<br>  <br>  However, I do think that joking about the death of any public figure is reprehensible and not defensible.  The fact that in Latin America they do this does not make it okay.  In certain Islamic courts they cut the hands off of thieves, that doesn't make it okay to do it here.  We have lost whatever small shreds of dignity that we once had as a population and the willingness to condone, even by comparison, these types of acting out is a major cause of the downtrend.|`|SWkaGJpgaa	Those are all things that idiots do.<br>  <br>  I won't accept any "cultural" excuse for it, either.

AA11424947	Let's answer all of your questions:<br>  <br>  "Is it fair to call Obama a communist when he's obviously [a] patriot who loves his country?"<br>  <br>  Of course it's not fair to call Obama a communist, but don't expect McCain supporters to be fair when they know McCain is going way down in the polls. Expect them to become more hateful, like the people you see in this video:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/savp/evp/?loc=dom&vid=/video/politics/2008/10/17/racist.obama.newsletter.kcal" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/video/savp/evp/?loc=d...</a><br>  <br>  This video stands as proof the degree of racial bias being perpetuated by some McCain supporters, and they remain in total denial over it while employing Machiavellian tactics to get another liar into the White House.<br>  <br>   <br>  "And what of the socialist remarks? Do people want to irradicate socialism in this country?"<br>  <br>  The McCain supporters making remarks about Obama being a Marxist are the same ones saying Obama is a terrorist, arab, and Muslim. I think that sums up their education, yes?<br>  <br>  <br>  "Calling Obama a marxist...racial undertones?"<br>  <br>  YES. Marxist, Muslim, Communist, etc. all means the same thing to these people. They think most Americans are fearful of these words. So, like the BUsh politics they've all learned so well, they lie and associate Obama with the things that are too easily considered "anti-American." <br>  <br>  Joe the plumber has no time to read Marx. <br>  Joe the plumber only learns he's supposed to hate Marx. <br>  Joe the plumber is a hypnotized parrot.<br>  Most answers here are from Joe the plumber.<br>  <br>  <br>  I am NOT Joe the plumber.|`|ss0vy4tFaa	it's got nothing to do with race<br>  <br>  a commie is a commie|`|6L1YwoWdaa	He's Black so there must be right?

If you do not do that, don't blame whitey. It's your own damn fault.

McCain came across with a full resume' vs an empty suit.<br>  <br>  Time and again McCain effectively explained his positions and took many points for his contrasting himself with Obama. If you didn't know about many of Obama's radical positions and associations, due to Big Media covering for him, the public is far more aware NOW!<br>  And Obama...after many of McCain's answers...all the messiah could do was to sit there, looking away, with a broad grimace on his face....Why? Because he had no rebuttal for the truth. <br>  Obama again used the Big Lie to try and turn aside the facts presented by McCain with no way for the average listener to respond or check the facts.|`|1ca97aeb1adb840d4eb477bdf71f8911aa	McCain, Obama stayed on defense and said nothing of substance other than his talking points.<br>  <br>  McCain actually addressed some of the issues Obama has been on the wrong side of and Obama did not respond with satisfactory answers.<br>  <br>  The Idea that Obama won by sitting back and saying nothing new is degrading to all past and future debates. Obama did win the first debate, but the last one was all McCain's|`|AA11827582	Obama...<br>  <br>  Why? Because McCain lost it when he admitted that the only reason he was running a negative campaign against Obama was because he wouldn't do the Town hall Meetings...<br>  <br>  it reminds me of when I was 6 and my sister was 8 and she pushed me down the stairs, when my Mom asked her why, she said because I would not play barbies with her...<br>  <br>  I don't think the country can afford to elect an 8 year old for president!|`|zXq4NYXvaa	Obama, easliy.

McCain just came off as grumpy, nasty, and desperate.  <br>  <br>  Even still, the American people are set to lose, no matter who won last night.  Who is talking about the important things?  How are we going to eliminate poverty?  Forget about winning the war in Iraq, how is our country going to be at peace?  Why are we focused on just the minimal question of creating jobs, but how is our country going to prosper again?  |`|YCL50xgnaa	Obama won by remaining calm & collected, restating his positions and trying to steer clear of petty bickering.  McCain presented himself as an old, patronizing, complainer, which I think will further alienate him from thinking Americans, and those truly concerned with putting a 'doer' rather than a whiney, rickety, angry, curmudgeon in the White House.|`|KjqGgJmvaa	Obama won in my opinion.

SU8Dv2ZAaa	Despite the arguments that some people present that the invasion and occupation of Iraq is illegal, which it's not, it doesn't really matter. For something to be "illegal" there has to be someone to enforce that law, and who is going to step up and force the U.S. to abide by it? The super powers can do just about anything they want.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	The simple answer is that the Gulf War of 1991 had never officially ended.  It was only at a cease-fire.  Saddam broke the conditions of that cease-fire repeatedly, and coalition forces were justified to remove him at any time over that 12 -year period).  It was the same authority that the Clinton Administration used to fire cruise missiles into Iraq.  That didn't constitute an act of aggression because of the cease-fire rules.  Same thing with the Iraq War.  <br>  <br>  Additionally, there were over 12 separate UN resolutions against Saddam Hussein, and the final one authorized US action.|`|vddPsXzIaa	How would Americans liked it if NATO or whatever started to bomb their infrastructure and industry to save Native Americans from ethnic cleansing and such massacres like Wounded Knee in the 19th century? And after that took all "Indian territories" under international control and deployed KFOR there? In ten years they would say that further being within one state is impossible for Americans and Native Americans and "Indian territories" would become independent. <br>  <br>  Here you can see that the war in Iraq is obviously an aggression. As well as in Serbia.|`|QdNuoS52aa	i would like for someone to show me where the law is that determines when war is legal or illegal.|`|lIBEhSrwaa	well for starters it's not a war of aggression, as a matter of fact it's not a war at all, that has been over for quite sometime.<br>  <br>  second the US Senate,and House authorized us to be there, that's all the legal justification we need, but there was also several UN resolutions that Saddam repeatedly ignored. if you need sources for the UN resolutions you have no idea what your talking about anyway same goes for the Senate, and House votes.<br>  <br>  Where do you come up with your terms for war? all you need for a war is for one party to go to war with another. all the treaties, and agreements are only valid if everyone continues to abide by them. which Saddam clearly did not.<br>  <br>  However i can see that no matter what anyone says you will only disagree with facts that don't agree with your preconceived notions. so unless i agree with you you will just dismiss what i have to say anyway. typical of the blind followers of the Anti-War Movement.|`|YePcg0bHaa	As legal as the War of Northern Agression was in the US in the 1860's: its not.|`|CJzqy0phaa	those with the biggest guns make the rules|`|agu6pVK2aa	I'll take a stab at this.<br>  <br>  Essentially, if one nation feels that an attack is imminent, they are justified in attacking themselves., out of self-defenseCase and point: The 6-day war (Yom Kippur War). Israel laid out a set of things that they would consider to be acts of aggression, even without them being specifically acts of violence. Then Egypt crossed too many lines, and Israel attacked and was justified. (Why wait to get punched when you know there is about to be a fight?)<br>  <br>  Skip ahead to 2003. With Saddam being uncooperative with UN inspectors, the US was able to you Casus belli to claim that they felt that an attack from, or linked to, Iraq would come unless an attack was made.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT*** <br>  <br>  Um, I even cited where this has happened and been decided to be legal with the case of the Yom Kippur war. Just because you say it was illegal doesn't mean it was.<br>  <br>  **EDIT**<br>  <br>  Abraham D. Sofaer identified four elements for justification of preemptive war:<br>  <br>  1) The nature and magnitude of the threat involved <br>  <br>  2) The likelihood that the threat will be realized unless preemptive action is taken <br>  <br>  3) The availability and exhaustion of alternatives to using force; and <br>  <br>  4) Whether using preemptive force is consistent with the terms and purposes of the U.N. Charter and other applicable international agreements. <br>  <br>  Of those for clauses I see only one possible (Number 3) which is shaky. The first and second deal mainly with perceptions. The US felt Iraq was a threat, and that great harm would come by innaction. On points 1 & 2, George Tennet said that it was a "slam dunk" that Iraq had WMDs, which in the hands of terrorists would pose a huge threat to the nation. On point 4, as I have pointed out Israel already demonstrated pre-emptive war as a means of self-defense, thus we have precedence. The only possible requirement not meant would be number 3, but the question then becomes "were all alternatives exhausted?"|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	That would probally be the UN Security Council Resolutions<br>  <br>  That created the UN authorized Multinational Force in iraq.<br>  <br>  UN Security Council resolution 1546 (2004)<br>  <br>  extended by<br>  <br>  UN Security Council resolution 1637 (2005). <br>  <br>  and extended again by<br>  <br>  UN Security Council resolution 1723 (2006).<br>  <br>  and extended by<br>  <br>  UN Security Council resolution 1873 (2007).<br>  <br>  |`|AA12392755	Since there isn't a "US war of aggression" against Iraq, it can be neither legal nor illegal.
Ot7PJrddaa	I think the war ended more because Eisenhower didn't want to escalate the war the way the commanding general was arguing for.  Also when Stalin died (about the same time as Eisenhower becoming president) the Soviets had less of a reason to continue the fight.  Last but not least China was running out of resources to fight the war and they bore the brunt of the opposition in both manpower and material - the combination of these factors led to the end of the war.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	The Korean War just sort of petered out.  Everyone was ready for a cease-fire.  Of course, the war is "technically" still going on since there is no official surrender or armistice, which is why we have 50,000 soliders perennially on the DMZ.  <br>  <br>  The US accomplished their primary goal of containing communism.

There  was never really an end  to it because  even to this  day   the  north koreans are  still  at  war with the  south  koreans. with the  two main protagonists held apart by treaty and  mine fields. Its thought that if the cease fire agreement hadn't being  signed  nuclear weapons would  have been used  to alt  the chinese  armies  that  had moved to help  the north koreans. This would  have most likely caused a  3d world  war because  the russians  who  where  allied to both china and  north  korean  would have retaliated by  using  nuclear weapons against the  Un forces  in  south korea.|`|D8MGUoUpaa	Their were many reasons.

Bush just wanted to save face, that's all and it cost the country.

It is the basis for such statements as "Judge not, least ye be judged." People tend to see in others what they do not accept in themselves.<br>  <br>  Freud seems to be the first to use the term "psychological projection" and so it is often referred to as "Freudian projection". The key to this is the hidden trait in Self that one sees in others.<br>  <br>  For example: the person who hides their own aggressive tendencies may then see other people acting in an excessively hostile manner.<br>  <br>  In some cases the trait is known to Self, but hidden from others, such as the person who is cheating in a relationship who then believes (or acts as if) that their mate is cheating.<br>  <br>  Since Projection is part of the subjective reality of a person, it can seldom be determined by the person doing the projecting. The reality check usually requires the intervention of an outside source.<br>  <br>  The most common example is the Projection (assumptions) that take place during acute Romance. The person feels an emotion similar to Love and fills in details about the partner with Projections of their wishes. This tends to continue until outside information (usually from others not involved) overwhelms these false projections and the Romantic partner is seen for who they really are. At this point the Romance rapidly fades.<br>  <br>  If you personally want to know if you are projecting and not perceiving reality, investigating your own motives is the best place to start. An honest friend can be of great help. If one is not available (or will not take a chance of putting your friendship on the line), a professional councilor can often help.|`|GHusBLjgaa	Not the US just Obama, you see in Obama I do see the 2nd coming, the 2nd coming of Jimmy Carter, and it was Carter complete incompetence that gave us a great man and a great President in Ronald Reagan.

However, Obama has done very little to show that he's up to the job that lays before him...so while we're definitely not hoping, we are in a state of (scary) expectation.<br>  <br>  It's a little like going in for a root canal.

AA11334116	Totally, McCain is just bitter because he does not have the same grass roots support as Obama.|`|bwEVh8qmaa	Absolutely.  So, instead of using public funds for his campaign, Obama elected to use private fund raising efforts; and McCain disagrees with this.  I don't get it; isn't it better to use my money than to use your money for my purposes?  Do I have it right?  If not, enlighten me.|`|598fac7b695aab3b03ad03f66442a74eaa	This is just one more example of something Obama said he would do then conveniently changed his story.

Citizens in record numbers have given him donations.|`|4iAMrHd1aa	Obama is the first candidate ever to opt out of the public finance system.  He's going to end up spending well over a HALF-BILLION DOLLARS to get elected.  When you consider that McCain is fixed at the public-finance level of 84 million and cannot legally spend more, it's clear that Obama is going to win just by outspending McCain, regardless of all other considerations.  <br>  <br>  The real danger is what happens in 2012.  From now on, all candidates will be forced to opt out of public financing in order to compete.  The system set up to keep spending down after Watergate is now obsolete due to Obama opting out.  There are no more limits on spending.  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself this: how can anyone govern independently when they owe a HALF-BILLION DOLLARS to the money-men behind them?  It's impossible, and that goes for any Republican or Democrat.  That kind of money guarantees corruption.  Even a saint would be utterly corrupted after having to raise that kind of money to get elected.  It requires politicians to "sell their souls" by promising all kinds of quid pro quo paybacks to the rich donors.  <br>  <br>  In other words, the more money it takes to get elected, the more the president is owned by the rich fatcats who bought the office for him.  That's what we have to fix.<br>  <br>  We should mandate that in 2012, all candidates are REQUIRED to use public financing, for the sake of democracy.|`|rXyccWjQaa	No he's stating the facts, FEC will conduct investigations on Obama's donations after the elections, For his sake he better hope he wins this thing...|`|LxdiTYE8aa	Yes, but when the ship is sinking strange things are said and done.|`|bAoOEzXtaa	it's all over for Mccain........waaaaaaaaaa.waaaaaaaaaa,wa...|`|31EiBJIvaa	They are peobably looser than some one who is tighter.!!|`|Svanlzg7aa	Obama is the one who stated if McCain takes public financing so would he.

His administration passed an historic tax cut based on dramatic cuts in marginal tax rates and began a massive defense buildup. To help compensate for the tax cut, his first budget called for slashing $41.4 billion from 83 federal programs, only the first round in a planned series of cuts. And Reagan himself made known his desire to eliminate the departments of Energy and Education, and to scale back what his first budget director David Stockman called the "closet socialism" of Social Security and Medicaid."

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Obama's whole campaign has skipped over budget realities. There is nothing new here. One of my biggest complaints about Obama is his lack of substance. He makes a habit of not really answering questions. When asked something difficult he tends to change the subject, gloss over the issue, try to rouse support with platitudes, or blames the opposition. This format is exactly what Obama has shown he favors. One where he is complete control, looking at teleprompter and staying on message. It was just a self serving infomercial. Nothing more, nothing less.|`|dyV9MPhDaa	This article just proves further that Obama does not walk the talk.<br>  Or even come close to saying the same thing month to month.|`|gzjWQo1eaa	There are alot of things skipped over in everything Obama says and does, his past has a lot of blanks in it as well. |`|944b14f23dca16304ce58a5d55e2a97daa	The irony here is that Yahoo news is liberal media in the tank for Obama|`|U3wrQ8Q2aa	do you think mccain tells the truth and nothing but the complete truth?  mccain will also have to figure out where to cut costs and get money for the programs he wants to promote.<br>  <br>  don't kid yourself.  |`|yVufZOG5aa	okay the man wants to money into healthcare and homes families and education where do you want it to go in the gov. pockets give me a break do you even care about ur self |`|7DAIw6XTaa	Not true.

If I were the editor that wouldn't have gotten past me.

You should have watched it for yourself. <br>  <br>  **Edit** well I can hardly take anyone serious that uses "the guy makes me ill to look at" as an excuse to not watch it. If that were the case I'd never listen to anything McCain has said, If you'd have watched it your questions would have been answered.<br>  <br>  Their so called facts are ridicules, he never implied that premiums would be lower, merely that the over all plan would be more affordable. <br>  <br>  The so called tax spin the tag is simply 1 line , there is no "spin" on it had you watched, you'd have seen and heard the rest. Also, had you read both candidates plans you would see that BOTH leave debt however Obamas leaves considerably less debt. There is not a candidate running that has been able to promise no debt. <br>  <br>  The so called spin / facts about Iraq aren't relevant to one another .... <br>  <br>  This article would have held more weight if the spin/facts were more directly related. <br>  <br>  In any case it is proof that some of you would rather let the media make your minds up than to check facts out for yourself. I might not agree with much of anything McCain says BUT I listen, every chance I get to all sides so that I am not only half informed.<br>  <br>  Rather then trying to be witty in your "comebacks " at people, you should read it again and actually see what it is saying, better yet go and look and all the plans from all the candidates. <br>  I don't need to defend against a poorly thought out and written article.

Otherwise he wouldn't stand a chance.  If people would do a little research instead of depending on the media to tell them who to vote for, this would be a landslide in favor of McCain.

These two will be able to deliver. Obama is a wonderful talker, but the only change we will see under his administration is a change for the worst. I don't believe that McCain and Palin are best thing since slided bread, but they will fight for what they said they would. Obama will not veto bills from his party even if the bills go against what he has stated in his speeches. I want someone in Washington that will say no to lobbyist and say yes to smart spending. We need less government run programs to work as enablers for the poor. Obama wants to give you a hand out disguised as a hand up. He knows that the system he has in mind will only let you make one step up and then you are all alone destine to fall back down. This is how "BIG GOVERNMENT" keeps you dependant on them.<br>  <br>  Some of Obama's favorite words are "I will fight for...." His idea of fight is present it to the Democratic majority congress for them to strike it down. Then he gets to say "I tried to fight for .....".<br>  <br>  His other favorite words are "I will fix .......". HOW? He never tells us how. McCain has told us that he wants to cut funding to some particular government run agencies or organizations. Obama just says "I will fix the economy". McCain has said that he would tax our employee medical care to raise money for government while Obama says he will FIX health care and reduce taxes. Where is the money going to come from? Do you think that congressmen and women will pass a bill that says any one making over $250,000 will have to pay more taxes? NO THEY WON'T! The reason is simple, most of them make that amount or more and every lobbyist on capital hill is well above that range. There will be no taxes raised on the $250,000 people. That means those of us that fall below that mark is going to pay the price. Higher income tax, taxes on products we buy, and taxes on services. Now if this is not enough reason for you to vote for McCain, then you must be very, very rich or completely lost. Either way, you want mind Obama because your rich and will stay rich or you are too lost to know what is going on. Oh, by the way, I hope that when you heard Obama say that he was going to "spread the wealth" around that you know that does not mean that everyday people are going to see that money. It will be going from one rich man's bank to another rich man's bank.|`|ITOdbpEyaa	THE YOUTH VOTE FOR THE GOP SHOWS SOME CARE MORE FOR COUNTRY THAN A HANDOUT LIKE THE WORTHLESS LIBERALS  WANT .

That said, that makes it nothing different than a birth defect. People are born with heart defects, lung defects, even mental defects (retardation) etc., and being gay is simply a brain-wiring defect. Something formed wrong in the development of the fetus.<br>  <br>  Also, we as a society recognize that there are some people who are attracted to kids, animals, and dead bodies. But we do not accept or condone that kind of sexual behavior. Our society recognizes that people attracted to these things have something wrong with them - I believe the same should be said for gays. There is simply something wrong with them. Our medical profession should be encouraged to address this deformity, and study it in order to be able to fix it - much like how they have studied and learned to fix other birth defects.|`|Xzs6X7sZaa	This proposition is not on my ballot, so I won't be expressing an opinion on it this election year.

It is not a religious issue. There exists something called 'freedom of religion'. This means the freedom to follow a religion and the freedom to not follow a religion. You're drawing a parallel between the religious definition and legal definition of marriage. You must not do this if we are to enjoy freedom of religion. A Yes vote on Prop. 8 is denying a right; the right to marry (I think that's even the title on the ballot. It's quite accurate)<br>  <br>  You use the majority of voters as a reason to deny this right.  What if the right of blacks to marry was put on the ballot and denied by a majority of voters? Should this also be respected? This is why there are Supreme Court judges, to protect injustices perpetrated by the majority of the populous on a minority. This is against the California Constitution and will be reversed once again. People who collected signatures to get this unconstitutional PERSONAL belief on the ballot only wasted taxpayer dollars. <br>  <br>  If you put this abstractly, the rights of a minority of the populous are being put on the ballot and voted on. This is a horrible practice and truly unjust. Tolerance is a large part of a democracy. You must learn to tolerate the PERSONAL decisions of others, as others do yours.<br>  <br>  I am heterosexual. That homosexual couples may marry does not harm me as I can continue my life just as before they were allowed to marry. Do not try to fix your PERSONAL views on others.<br>  <br>  P.S. This whole deal with legal suits against priests and what not is entirely false. California law affords priests (etc.) the right to deny marriage to any homosexual couple or heterosexual couple. This proposition won't change that.  Nor will it change California schools' curriculum either. All these field trips you speak of MUST be authorized by the child's parent or legal guardian prior to it happening. So, if these kids attended these gay weddings, then their parents MUST have been okay with it. Also, any other teaching of marriage (gay or straight) requires a parent's consent as with all other slightly controversial matters. Email the California Superintendent of Education for confirmation on these issues. It is current law --the passage of Prop. 8 WILL NOT change or alter this.  Pay attention to current law.<br>  <br>  Keep your PERSONAL beliefs on religion to yourself and respect the PERSONAL choices of others. We live in a supposed democracy of tolerance and justice. Deal with it.<br>  <br>  P.P.S Again, Joseph H, that a majority of Californians (voting) approved to deny a minority of the populous Constitution-granted rights means nothing if the proposition's intent is just that --unconstitutional.  This is exactly the duty of Supreme Court judges.  Otherwise, anyone with enough signatures could change the law according to how they see fit, and in the process disenfranchise a small (unpopular) sector of the population. It is a beautifully crafted governance of checks and balances. Let it perform as intended.|`|73hsvCU0aa	The 'field trip' was instigated by the parents of the children, to celebrate the union of a beloved teacher.<br>  <br>  Who says marriage is between a man and a woman?

Yahoo is a private organization and may control speech within its network as it sees fit.  Only the government can violate the constitutional right to free speech.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	All freedoms have restrictions and responsibilities.

Since no charge has been set it is impossible to prove you have been imprisoned for what you said.<br>  <br>  The Digital Millenium Copyright Act, sponsored by several including Hillary Rodham Clinton, has also been used to gag people, in particular Professor Edward Felton who was going to deliver a paper on croptographics to a conference with the topic the digital watermark on music.  The RIAA threatened to sue him under the DMCA and he withdrew his paper.  Someday the Supreme Court is likely to hear his suit against the RIAA and the DMCA which effectively abridged his freedom of speech and perhaps a really bad law which has ruined several lives and kept linux users from playing DVD movies will be struck down.<br>  <br>  There is always a time between one of these brain-dead laws and the application of the constitutional right where people are adversely affected.  <br>  <br>  So right now, you have freedom of speech, but you might find yourself under one of the adverse effects of laws passed for special commercial or political interests if you choose to exercise it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now as far as Yahoo Answers, it is NOT a public site.

zKM9P2kYaa	no you have to be 16|`|hWsNrDNUaa	You can get a provisional license at 16 (which means you have certain restrictions on it in the beginning).  When you get a license, you get it with a stripe across the bottom that reads "provisional until age 18 in 20XX" and under that you have another strip that says "age 21 in 20XX". Or something like that.<br>  At 18, all restrictions are lifted and you get FULL driving privileges.<br>  <br>  ::EDIT::<br>  to add on to what Steve said... I believe you have to have found an driving instructor and have that person sign a form for you before you could get your permit.  After getting your permit (written test) you have to have it for at least six months (up to a year before it expires) before you could take the road test.  In that time you have to complete at least 6(?) hours of driving with a certified instructor and at least 50(?) hours driving under adult supervision.|`|70e9d9eee37ee3f1f4008f4ae6b92dc8aa	No, that's not true.

I don't need someone to lead me around and think for me.|`|XeF4PO6baa	There's a difference between being "for" gay marriage and being opposed to a Constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman.  Most of the people you listed believe that marriage laws should be decided by the states and not by the federal government, not that gay marriage should necessarily be legal.  Others, such as Ron Paul, believe that marriage is inherently a religious institution and as such government should have no role in it (which is the view to which I ascribe).  Marriage should stay in the church, and there should be no legal recognition of it (as it was up until about a hundred years ago).|`|izXIAxXGaa	I don't know what part of the country you are from Health Nut. You are not going to like what I am telling you here.<br>  This is only the tip of the iceberg. Do you remember Bill Clinton asking for a "national mandate"? And have you ever heard candidate Obama and President Obama talk about a mandate? That is the mandate- gay marriage legalized as a national mandate. There is also a referendum to prohibit adoption agencies from discriminating against prospective gay parents as well as a quota system whereby adoption agencies will be required to allow X number of gay and lesbian parents to adopt at every agency in the country, similar to affirmative action in the work place.|`|kiyVz23Jaa	Makes me feel that some people have strayed away from their religion and have given in to and accepted the fact they their right to freedom of religion along with religious views have been stolen.<br>  <br>  I don't agree with Gay marriage.

Did he apply for foreign exchange student money? Is that why he is hiding his college records?

Why is Obama being so cruel as to not produce these things?

His infomercial has NOT calmed anyone down, but shown to what length he will go to do so WITHOUT being transparent and producing the documents that he must have.

They were an extreme right-wing group.<br>  <br>  The fact that the word "socialist" appeared in the title was merely a ruse to appease "German only" workers. There was nothing socialist about them and they detested communists.<br>  <br>  They controlled the private ownership of guns to eliminate the possibility of armed resistance.<br>  <br>  Calling the Nazis "liberal" is just about as wrong as you could get.|`|bjmmAwo6aa	Your question is grammatically incorrect.  It should read:  IS there a link ...<br>  Actually it is the Republican Party whose policies are being manipulated by the "religious right" and those types of groups. The Constitution of the United States clearly cites "the separation between Church and State". These religious groups, do not believe in this fact, and wish to clearly involved the church in the state. These same groups do not approve of certain books and literature being taught in schools and have been fighting the states on "content" of literature throughout history. In the 1920's religious groups took over state legislatures in the southern states and banned certain literature and the theory of evolution. They had book burnings, where they burned Huckleberry Finn, because the book depicted a white person and a black person being friends. In theory, they were censoring what children could learn. They only wanted the state to teach what values their church approved of. In banning the theory of evolution, they stopped the teaching of not only evolution but also biology and many of the sciences. The South is still recovering today from the effects the religious attack on the sciences. In short, they wanted to control what was being taught, wanted to close young minds to the truth. They only wanted their truth to be taught. The image of book burning and control of knowledge and information is exactly the same thing the Nazi regime did. The Republican Party is on a dangerous course by supporting and being manipulated by the religious right. Do we want public schools to only teach what a certain religion dictates? Or do we want a free society, where educational institutions teach the clear, uncensored, objective truth.|`|AA11086243	you mean people that want to hold people without trial and torture them?<br>  <br>  Guantanamo? what?<br>  <br>  many people favor gun control... to assume they are all Nazis is quite a stretch, since the vast majority have no history of favoring holding people without trial, murder or torture...|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Their reasons for gun control were different.

What about the textile and furniture industries and shoe industry that are no longer here because we import all of that stuff from China, Mexico, Taiwan, Sir Lanka?  Every industry is suffering. Republicans have always been about big business but not about big business giving jobs to the people of the United States, they are interested in the money that big business makes. Isn't it funny that the oil industry has made the largest profits in history over the last 8 years and the Bush family has all of their money in oil? You think they are worried about the little guy? If McCain has been so worried about the little guy in America then how come he voted 90% of his votes with Bush? Now he is saying he wants to change things around? Why didn't he feel that way before?  Hell, the Republicans pushed through a 700 billion dollar bail out to big business. They say it is to get the economy flowing again. Why didn't they give a half a million dollars to every adult person in the United States which if you divide 700 billion by the amount of adult people in the United States we would have all gotten that sum. I think that would have boosted out economy a lot better than giving it to large companies that obviously don't know how to run a large company or they wouldn't have been in this problem in the first place. The Republicans have been in office for 8 years and none of the things that are happening are a surprise to them. It has been planned for a very long time. Now they have bought shares of our private banking sector. So now the government owns part of our banking system. Bush is pushing through everything he can think of at the last minute. The war in Iraq costing us 11 billion a month is making big money for Bush , his family and all his old croonies. We have been a nation of fools. We sat back and watched as Bush gave away our country over the last 8 years. Samuel Prescott Bush, George W's grandfather, laundered money for Hitler in the days before and during WW2. Hitler told him that the only way to run a country was to make the people of that country very afraid, afraid of their own country as well as others and to keep them at war because war makes good money for the top people of that country. So, isn't it funny that both Bush Sr. and George W. put this country at war as soon as they got into office? They knew what they were doing. It was all planned. Not to mention the personal vendetta that the Bush's had against Iraq because that country would not sign the contract that all the other mid-eastern countries signed in 1984 and that was to give us their oil and we would make them very rich and they would buy our debt. The only two countries that would not sign this contract was Iraq and Iran. Yes, the Republicans want big busniness to make more and more money becuase it makes the all the CEO's and company management of these greedy companies richer and richer and all the jobs are sent to other countries where they don't have unions to protect the people. We have all been sheep following along with letting the rich get richer and the poor get pooer. I think it is enough. Obama is not going to get rid of the coal companies but he may see to it that the actual coal miner makes more money and the actual big shots of the coal companies pay more taxes and make less money. That is his plan for all huge companies. He wants the jobs to stay in the United States where they belong and the big companies to do well but what company needs a 500 billion dollar profit and doesn't even hire United States people but sends all of their work to China and other countries? We are tired of seeing these large greedy companies run our country and make billions in profits. And if they don't then it's boo hoo and the Reppulicans go in and bail them out. It's enough to make me sick and we just sit back and let it happen? I think not. Wake up America! Who makes all the big money? Is it the average coal miner?<br>  |`|AA11458923	Work in factories that build wind turbines.

AA11163314	I really find it hard to be completely for or against either side of the issue.  On one hand I feel that we need to enforce the law - but on the other hand I do not want to punish people who simply want to be Americans.<br>  <br>  I see the situation as two separate but inter-related issues:<br>  <br>  1) Illegal immigrants (people who came here to live permanently)<br>  2) Illegal economic migrants (people who are only here for the money and feel no sense of loyalty or obligation to our society)<br>  <br>  The first groups needs to be treated with compassion while the second group I have no sympathy for.<br>  <br>  BTW - I feel that the only way we are going to get the immigration situation under control is to make employers liable for any illegals they have working for them.  (However the government would be required to provide a system where an employer can verify status.)<br>  <br>  |`|AA11702773	no, because the subsidies like education and health care are too expensive and harm services for our own people who pay for them.  Also, illegal immigrants are primarily of an economic class that pays less in taxes than it takes in services- whether for themselves or for their eventual children, while our entitlement systems are already failing for those who paid into them all of their adult lives.   This is why every developed country in the world limits the number of poor immigrants it takes.   Amnesty would be allowing those who cut in line to benefit, which is bad policy, as well.  We have to respect the rule of law, or we will encourage even more to come illegally.|`|2Hlctljgaa	no|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, they are here illegally, the cost to remove them is too high for what it is worth, and they wouldn't voluntarily leave en masse.  So... we're stuck with this illegal population of several million, meanwhile, most of them just want to work.  It is beneficial for us to treat them as regular working class citizens, so I say we legalize them.  At the same time, any plan to grant them amnesty must be accompanied with a strong and serious policy to keep future groups of illegals out.|`|AA10847421	No they broke the law.

It's kinda like the "bailout"...nobody wants to do it, but the professional economists agree it is necessary.<br>  <br>  As of now, we have a huge population of people who live as "criminals" mostly in poverty... they're living and working in our society "under the radar", with no access to insurance, they have fake id's, ...they are a very disadvantaged group of people and by keeping them in this condition we raise the crime rates, disease, drug use, illiteracy rates.<br>  <br>  If the otherwise law abiding illegals were given amnesty, they might not work under the table and start contributing some tax dollars instead of just being a drain on our economy.|`|cb55c53480fb7b57fae8733bf5e62f5daa	NO -- -the Hispanic population is exploding in the USA <br>  In 1990 the Hispanic population was 9% <br>  In 2006 the Hispanic population was 14.8%<br>  to put that in  perspective with other people in the nation <br>  The African American population was 12.4% of the population in 1990<br>  In 2006 it was 12.8%<br>  we gave amnesty to over 3 million illegals in the 1970's, now it's approx. 20 million, if you give these amnesty, what will it be in 10 years and is this fair to other people around the world that would like to be a citizen of America<br>  It puts undue pressure on all the states finances, causing tax increases, look at California, it's going bankrupt<br>  But the Democrats want this , because it's 20 million more LOYAL voters for them in future elections<br>  how can I make this statement, well the Hispanics will know that a Democrat president and Democrat congress gave them amnesty and will vote Democrat to help others get   amnesty in the future|`|6B1sxgtOaa	NO!

It also won't stop some people from being racist even if Obama turns out to be an incredible president. Too many people are set in their ways and some things never change.|`|cbb4e4c8f0eaf193e8071782cd48f149aa	Of course not. There has been a whole industry created that relies solely on playing the race card. Are you saying you want to put Jesse Jackson and his demented evil sidekick, Al Sharpton out of business?

ewIELhBiaa	I think that yes if this next 4 years doesn't produce some progress for our country then it will be difficult for the next minority to be elected. <br>  I think this not that 1 person can represent an entire race or that is should. I say this because there to far more bigots and people who would group an entire race together rather than to base the failure on the person at fault. We have to realize and we all seen it during this race and since that society hasn't truly come that far when race is a factor it's just more secretive. Believe me I have seen it a lot since the election and have been affected by it since. <br>  I do think we will see change of course it's unrealistic to think that everything will be done but I do think that we will see a positive change in economics and our industry which will improve the job nmarket.|`|6cF1n1GLaa	Well, firstly I did not vote for Obama (or Macain). But, I think that it will not get worse than it is now. Also, now that I listened to his victory speech, he does have a point or vision of restoring USA. I will grant him my vote, if throughout his presidency, he will not engage in a military conflict with any weak country just because he can. This will indicate to me where he puts his energy. And if he does at least 25% of what he promises, he will get my vote in 4 years.|`|t2LZIUClaa	Each person are their own Person. <br>  <br>  No two people are alike or do things alike.<br>  <br>  So Judging on by another is not wise. <br>  <br>  If Obama does not treat all Americans the same. If He shows Favorites or special treatment for one group over another,  he will be a hypocrite and wrong.<br>  <br>  Obama made promises, which probably never intended to keep.<br>  <br>  The American people need to hold him accountable for them any how.<br>  Since he did by playing Americans lives, their minds and their hearts, and their needs. He was Atonement that he would attain them and give them So he better give the people what he promised. Health Care, less taxes, better jobs, education, and better wages. Those are the promised he must give. Do not settle for less and do not take excuses.<br>  <br>  Mr Obama always has excuses and always blames someone else. It is time he is held accountable.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|NmsBFeNJaa	I honestly don't think that Barrack Obama(whom has already been elected, by the way) can influence all minority races and whether or not they will be able to secure presidency in the future. If anything, he is making it easier for those that come after him regardless of the choices that will be made in the next four years. Do you think that George W Bush has ruined the chances for every white man to run for president after him?<br>  <br>  Why would someone judge an entire race of people based on one person within that race?|`|vc03UAeXaa	1) Every white person that has been elected and broken their promise (read: every politican ever elected. EVER.) didn't have a problem getting elected the next time around<br>  <br>  2) I would hope that the American people realize his failure (IF it happens) is attributed to HIM, not his race. (I don't hold much faith though, key word there: HOPE).<br>  <br>  3) He can't execute his promise, the executive branch doesn't have the power to do a majority of what he talked about. What he is going to do, is present ideas to the congress and pray they pass the laws he wants.|`|yehJu1Awaa	Every president say what he will do for our nation and sometimes it happens and sometime it don't. I have faith in him and I do hope that he can fix what Bush has messed up as far as gas, war and so on, but no matter what race he is I truly don't feel that if he fails to do what is set out for him to do for this country he will mess up for minority's in the future who want to run for president.|`|NEWbh3Plaa	I agree with you.  I think he has a little higher standard to live up to now that he going to be our next president.  If he doesn't do everything he said he was going to I think it will be a long time before the American people elect another minority.  It is not right, but thats how it will be.  |`|wlu7qJMkaa	Well, considering he's not even in office yet, I think we should give him a year or so before we start seeing improvement.<br>  <br>  I actually don't think it'll have significant impact. There have been horridly stupid white guys in office for years, and we still keep electing them!|`|yUuaIrS6aa	I don't think people would tie Obama's failure to his race.  Those who were racist didn't vote for him anyway (note: that's NOT the same thing as saying you're a racist if you didn't vote for him, so...)<br>  <br>  If he fails, I'll blame Democrats, not race.|`|0d47360398fbfbe302ba1e0efed96bdbaa	I think he emulates JFK, hopefully his presidency won't end the same way.<br>  And I am sick of the discussion about his race. Have people forgot that he is also white?<br>  I have no doubt that he'll do a great job.|`|CU2yBIpeaa	not at all, look at every white president, they didnt live up to anything, they still get nominated for 43 of the 44 presidents|`|VRL8aZo7aa	No, there are plenty of self-hating white people who will vote for any non-qualified minority over a qualified, straight, white male.|`|XN0cYCATaa	You know I am so Happy that Millions of Young African American Children can wake up in the Morning and say to their parents "Mommy, Daddy, I don't have to have the only thing to look forward to in my life is being a Rap Star or a Sports star, I can be anything I want, and for that only I applaud his becoming President if only for that.<br>  Now That being said I am afraid for this country for the radical left socialistic views that Obama represents, and I hope the price that is to be paid for this sensation that African american children have is not too high.<br>  For I fear it will be.|`|pOJ8G7Sgaa	That's doubtful because most people think of overall substance before they think of skin color.

Lfl2yG5Zaa	Ikutan berbagi ah, Bro...<br>  <br>  Pancasila adalah ideologi yang juga berarti suatu sistem ide yang dijadikan dasar Negara Kesatuan Republik Indonesia. Sebagai prinsip dasar negara yang diharapkan menjadi "basic belief"; ataupun "way of life" sudah pasti dibuat sesempurna mungkin jadi tidak harus dirubah dari waktu ke waktu, kalau bisa sistem ide ini memang dibuat sekali tapi sudah bisa mencakup periode yang selama-lamanya dalam kehidupan berbangsa dan bernegara Indonesia. Tantangan dari<br>  para penyelengara pemerintahan maupun rakyat Indonesia adalah untuk merealisasikan mimpi atau impian konsep dasar Pancasila yang telah diletakkan oleh para pejuang kemerdekaan ini menjadi suatu kenyataan, bisa terwujud dalam penyelenggaraan pemerintahan maupun terwujud dalam tata masyarakat bangsa Indonesia secara keseluruhan.<br>  Jawabannya pasti ada yang sudah dilaksanakan dan ada yang belum, tapi kalau mayoritas jawabannya kita "belum" pada pertanyaan diatas, berarti penyelengara pemerintahan maupun rakyat Indonesia belum menjalankan prinsip-prinsip ideal dari sila-sila Pancasila sebagai dasar NKRI yang tertera dalam preambul UUD'45 yang seharusnya dipatuhi oleh para penyelenggara NKRI maupun seluruh rakyat Indonesia. Ini adalah tantangan kita semua sebagai bangsa yang dari waktu ke<br>  waktu harus melihat tingkah laku kita apakah sudah mengacu dengan perilaku ideal yang dicantumkan dalam Pancasila. Apakah peraturan-peraturan, undang-undang, UUD'45, kesemuanya telah punya benang merah dengan prinsip-prinsip Pancasila?<br>  Yang lebih penting lagi adalah apakah pelaksanaan dan perbuatan para<br>  penyelengara Nekara maupun rakyatnya sudah bersesuaian dengan benang merah.<br>  <br>  Mdh2an bermanfaat ya...|`|5yXbn5aKaa	soalnya penerapannya gak benar..|`|2a7d9badd96c9006c7c73cf7b3fe1775aa	no offense, tapi Pancasila ditulis oleh orang-orang tua beberapa dekade yang lalu, wajar saja tidak memberikan hasil yang terbaik bagi bangsa di zaman modern seperti saat ini|`|6Md7JL83aa	setuju dg penjawab terdahulu kecuali jawaban dari "dan".

Obama has promised things and promised things, without thinking about the consequences. his "sharing the wealth plan" is really just giving people who dont even try money from people who have spent their whole lives giving it their all. People say the fact that his polls are going down is raceism, and conspiracy, however its really just his bad planning. I do believe that quite alot of people who said they were voting for him aren't though, however, because of his race. Whatever happens, we'll find out tomorrow, but remember florida in 2000, bush lost the popularity vote, but he still won the election. so this won't completely determine it. whatever happens, I hope our new president will lead our country to a better future. whether its Obama, or McCain. <br>  <br>  however.. i'd honestly rather it be McCain.

Mccain kept falling into Obama's traps in each debate. Mccain's a patriot but I personally feel like Obama would be a better leader. He's more of a clear speaker than Mccain.<br>  <br>  The heat of all these debates seem really silly but it's really interesting. Makes me want to read the book War and Peace.<br>  <br>  The title Commander and Chief is a heavy burden and I feel like our current conservative president has failed in many ways. I pretty much want to see what's going to happen with the house of reps becoming liberal and a liberal president.<br>  <br>  Plus I think most "minorities" would become highly angry if Obama does not get elected. "That would be racist." That would be all over the news. I don't want to hear that crap.<br>  <br>  Either way it goes. I can manage and adapt on my own. It seems like Obama's plan will really benefit my future. I just hope this nation doesn't deteriorate like it did.|`|I8Xwe16Kaa	Obama because he wants to bring our troops back ASAP whereas Mccain wants to write another episode of the Vietnam War. <br>  <br>  This is not a beauty pageant where we have to get a victory, this is life and death and thousand of soldiers and civilians are dying in Iraq every day.|`|UFfsdHbyaa	MCCAIN cuz I believe he is a good ruler and more suitable as president.|`|w8eTVfiaaa	mccain.. experianced and war vet.|`|rMn7OOCXaa	I didnt vote, because neither deserved one, both voted for Amnesty and Bailout, for starters.  Voting for 'the least of the evils' is ok once in a while, but not every time<br>  <br>  At some point, they have to fear that being 'just a tiny bit less offensive' is not what it takes to get a vote - voting 'the lessor of the evils' assures that there's no consequence for misdeeds<br>  <br>  Republican base and Independents were totally against Amnesty and Bailout - who the heck did the republicans think they were?  Bush was a disaster<br>  <br>  I'm not happy about Obama, but mccain can go to hell|`|AA11812857	Obama<br>  <br>  First reason is that I just feel that the republicans had their turn, for eight years, and its time for a fresh start with a different party and since only two parties have a chance at the White House, I picked the party candidate that was different then the one leaving. So, in a sense, I just voted against having another president from the same party as the last president. Second reason is that Palin scares me. Here is a woman who believes dinosaurs lived with man a mere 3 or 4 thousand years ago (as if The Flintstones was a documentary) despite all the evidence to the contrary, has attempted to ban books which tells me she is dangerous to democracy, at one time held the well known opinion that Alaska should be allowed to secede from the US, has publicly made it known she has absolutely no idea what the vice president does, has a very limited education, and is basically abut as smart as Brittney Spears with about the same level of intellect ( <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/sarahpalin/a/palin-top-10.htm" rel="nofollow">http://politicalhumor.about.com/od/sarah...</a> ). Because McCain picked her as his running mate, I believe america can ill afford having a president that makes such horrible decisions before he is even in the White House and all to appease the religious conservatives and perhaps appeal to women voters, which hasn't worked well.|`|z8FC2wGMaa	For the sake of the rest of the planet Americans,  Please dont tell us you made the same mistake again like you did with Bush.

Neither of them likes white people worth a damn.<br>  <br>  This goes on all over the world and in many countries there is much worse prejudice than in the US - some of it institutionalized and even part of their laws.<br>  <br>  Frankly, Obama is NOT the "best" of anything on this subject or any other.<br>  He has been divisive and has used race as a weapon in his campaign.<br>  Many of us are sick and tired of being called racists.<br>  No, we won't forget having been repeatedly insulted and marginalized.<br>  Our votes were based on the issues and we still don't think he's qualified to be president.<br>  The only thing he's great at is dividing people for his own political gain.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	why are some black americans so racist against McCain?

Bush said he would take the war to them, so that our people would be safe here.  Have there been any attacks on this country since 9/11?

Also I think the only reason that he wasn't killed by his captures is because he was the son of a senator and was born with the silver spoon and he also said "this will look good when I run for office"(like that song "Fortunate Son") wand its pretty bad when your fellow veterans are discrediting you.

I liked the words he used, and i teared up when he said- Its not your fault its my fault.." something like that... <br>  <br>  Hes a really good person, I just think Obama will do a better job :) |`|tPMNAFbsaa	I can't believe I'm saying that right now but I have to admit that it was a great great speech. I give him my respects for it|`|7o3DMzXQaa	i never thought badly about Mr. McCain and truly believe he wants this country to thrive
TpCOkrWXaa	I give him a while longer. He's old, but there are a LOT of people that have lived longer than he has. Plus, his mother is in her 90s right now. And I'm sure that if he was elected president, he would be given the best doctors for any illness, just to keep him alive. No one would just let him die. Lets have some respect, don't talk about someone dying like its funny.|`|lU7jWzEJaa	Why do people always talk about him dying?  Can you really not think of anything better to talk about?  That's like me saying, "How long until your grandma dies?".  Not very nice is it?  And I would have LOVED to have Palin as our president, especially over Obama.|`|LxxrrKn9aa	nothing more than 1 term.|`|IrBJ5ARDaa	A guy like McCain will be around a long time.

Since he lost he will probably croak tomorrow in his sleep. LOL!|`|pLjiZ7WWaa	The reason you don't like Palin is because she values another life over her body. It is a womens right to choose if it pertains to her body but not when it pertains to a life of another individual. Therefor Abortion is murder and definatly wrong.

Should be ashamed of themselves.<br>  <br>  And for people like Ghost of Tom Joad, you seem to be missing the point of all of this. Besides, the plague was spread by the fleas, rats were merely carriers. As were dogs, cats, humans, etc. By your logic we should not feel sorry for human suffering because the species is responsible for atrocities, mass murders, Spanish flu, etc. That rat by its own really has no intention of hurting you, doesn't really know it's causing trouble and can't be blamed for what it is. The rat on its own wasn't responsible for the plague either.<br>  <br>  Kill them if you must, but to torture a living creature to death is sadistic and wrong. That it's a rat has no bearing to that very mantra.|`|wexMFhANaa	Sorry I couldn't watch the video but when it comes to any kind of animal being tortured it is absolutely inhumane and disgusting. I'm assuming by the comments that it's a rat? I used to have a pet rat and they are very smart creatures and very lovable. That's so sad. I wish death upon these kind of people who torture animals.
AA10709853	a good chance?  No.  a chance?  maybe.   you would NOT be permitted to attend college course until you hit the Fleet.. so not at all during Boot and A school.

PQntl3JXaa	dloc is right weed does u no harm. just because the gov says its wrong does not mean sh@#. killing a unborn is ok, at least that's what the gov says. its a woman's body she has the right. but u dont have the right to smoke that kills no one. indeed we have such smart people in office.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	It definitely can kill you.  Do you think the smoke is harmless?  It does affect your brain cells too.  As for the immune system, that's debatable but anything that affects the central nervous system can compromise the immune system.<br>  <br>  It can't help study habits, it will make them worse.  I think you are trying to find ways to justify it and it's just not there.  I don't think indulging a bit on the weekends will do anything more than those who have a few drinks but to think of it as helping you is only misleading yourself.|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	1 no. that was based on a badly executed study on monkeys in the 70's.<br>  #2 no. There has never been a single death attributed directly to marijuana.<br>  one thing it does is allows you to focus on and work with details. It can make mundane tasks tolerable. It makes you happy and unmotivated. Whatever talents you have will seem more fluid to work with while buzzed, but don't expect you've somehow become talented in areas that you have no aptitude for. You will not want to drive or fight. You will also feel like a pizza disposal unit, munchies!<br>  Go to www.jackherer.com this is one of the best sites around.<br>  THC stays in your system for about a month because your body does not see it as a toxin and therefore makes no effort to deal with removal. It is also very compatible with brain and fat tissue, in fact, your brain has specific receptors for THC that serve no other purpose according to a DEA study done in 1989.<br>  |`|zUkviN4Taa	Yes but the great thing is so does just about anything els in the air. <br>  2) There is some research that indicates pot temporarily blocks t-cell function and may suspend human immunity. The research is still a bit shaky at this point. Ironically though marijuana is often prescribed to AIDS patients who are dealing with nausea, weight loss and verve pain. So apparently it can't be that horrible of an effect on the immune system. <br>  <br>  For me it actually helps me focus. I had Attention Deficit disorder so ye pot does actually help me study better. I actually went to school every morning after having smoked it and I did very well in school. |`|Jx3FmfY3aa	1. No. Not only that, some studies have shown marijuana to have neuroprotective properties which can actually reduce brain cell death in certain cases.<br>  <br>  2. No. There have been studies that shown massive amounts of THC (1000s of times the normal dose) can somewhat impair the immune system in animals, so there is some truth to the myth.|`|9cpKYneZaa	1. Probably<br>  #2. Probably not.<br>  <br>  As far as effects. No it can't kill you. It will not improve your spelling if you're high.<br>  <br>  It can do other things to trick your brain.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is stay off drugs. But that's just a suggestion.|`|hLQrQ1bbaa	more like slow your brain cells, don't try and convince your self that weed is good, in the long run it is bad|`|uhjsrEsHaa	1. None of the medical tests currently used to detect brain damage in humans have found harm from marijuana, even from long term high-dose use. In a recent, carefully conducted study, researchers found no evidence of brain abnormality in monkeys that were forced to inhale the equivalent of four to five marijuana cigarettes every day for a year. The claim that marijuana kills brain cells is based on a speculative report dating back a quarter of a century that has never been supported by any scientific study.<br>  <br>  2.There is no evidence that marijuana users are more susceptible to infections than nonusers. Nor is there evidence that marijuana lowers users' resistance to sexually transmitted diseases. However, the recent finding of an association between tobacco smoking and lung infection in AIDS patients warrants further research into possible harm from marijuana smoking in immune suppressed persons.|`|E5pAvlmPaa	First off, no it does not kill healthy brain cells. Marijuana does kill brain cells but they are known as "glioma" cells, or brain cancer. These tumor cells develop from glial cells in the brain. Marijuana kills them because THC binds to them and causes them to commit cell-programmed death, or apostosis. The cell then kills itself, ending its cancerous growth. THC is actually shown to have neuroprotective properties, protecting neurons from damage and reducing the rate of diseases such as Alzheimer's. THC is also shown to stimulate nuerogenesis (the growth of new brain cells) in the hippocampus. The growth of these new neurons is shown to be linked with curing depression. However, marijuana is shown to have a double effect on depression, either helping or aggravating it depending on relative doseages.<br>  <br>  To answer the second question, THC does bind to and partially activate the CB2 receptors found mainly in the immune system on white blood cells. THC has been shown to calm the autoimmune attack on nerves caused by multiple sclerosis. THC also seems to reduce the autoimmune rejection of new organs found in transplant patients. Evidence shows that THC may have a slight suppressive effect on the immune system, but new studies show that it might actually stimulate the immune system to work more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Either way, marijuana will not kill you or your brain. The long term side effects are minimal and not permanent. People have been using it for thousands of years and any serious health concerns would likely be evident.<br>  <br>  Oral ingestion or use of a medical vaporizer negates the health risks of smoking and these forms of administration are completely safe.|`|AORmAac3aa	It does ALOT for you...It KILLS your brain cells. Isn't that enough? No? OK... If it is killing your brain cells how would it be possible to help you on quizzes and tests that require more use of your brain? It's a drug an illegal one. If it was good for you and helped people then don't you think it would be legal and on the market and everyone would be using it??? Stay away from it.|`|BV3Phrdzaa	studies have shown that weed doesnt kill brain cells and it doesnt kill your immune system either. the main effects it has on u r that it may cause u 2 forget things easier and it causes u 2 be hungry happy and sleepy. also studies have shown that there hasnt been any deaths from weed|`|FYdKoA4Paa	#1 yes. years of smoking pot has made it clear to me that playing video games and watch movies is a good life. <br>  <br>  #2, no, well, if you get strep throat it can make it worse. but that goes for anything you smoke.
s3E3KfBsaa	You really need to take some sort of government course and learn how things work. Your ignorance is really shining through.|`|VUoVmYZ0aa	I'm pretty liberal, but lets analyze this...well, think about it, the last 8 years have put him in a bind, they have little physical evidence that they are terrorists, however most of us are pretty certain that they are terrorists, so releasing them isn't an option. There is no way that releasing them will do any good to society because even if they didn't hate us then they probably do now and would go to join al-qaeda...that's bad. The ones we have strong evidence and even confessions from are tortured prisoners and torture is inadmissible in the US court system so we have to re-do the entire investigation and i really don't want to release them on bail, and lets not forget that a civilian judge might not allow a second investigation and may order the prosecution to hold the trial on what little, flimsy admissible evidence there may be (if there is any)...it is a travesty what we have done to them and if we could go back and do it right i'm pretty sure nobody would object, but seeing as we can't we just have to do it to future captured terrorists and hold the current ones as is. Lt's a double standard, but there's no other way that DOESN"T risk the LIVES of Americans EVERYWHERE.<br>   If only the last 8 years hadn't happened...|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Just because he isn't going to pursue them doesn't mean someone else wont.<br>  <br>  I think he realizes the gravity of the situation he is being put into and has larger issues to focus on.<br>  <br>  War crimes and crimes against humanity don't have a statute of limitations.|`|25faf33e24f40cd4a39b1314c62123a4aa	He will be the "typical" politician. He is already back pedaling on issues. I can't believe people elected a president with little to no real experience at a time of failing economy. It would take the best of experience to bring this around now. People stayed so pumped about "making history" that the real issues never came forth. All we can hope for now is that he surrounds himself with the good experience of others and is able to maintain this country for 4 years.|`|ee7afa2284dbb71d60c6d9445eb13af8aa	No, how could he? There are no charges to pursue. Aren't you the same guy who cannot cite any constitutional law giving these Gitmo terrorists rights? They are prisoners of war and have been treated more fairly then they deserve. You want them here in the U.S. so the ACLU can turn them loose into our society. You and Bill Ayers should sponsor them as good citizens. How's that for a plan?<br>  |`|5hxWSezPaa	I love it!  "Lefty Progressive"!

How come Japan also has one of the lowest crime rates?<br>  <br>  America has a culture of death, fear, and complacency...fueled by consumption. <br>  <br>  Time traveler: I'd also like to point out that America is one of the most prudish nations. Japan and Germany take the prize for being the most perverted countries. You can buy school-girl's panties and beer out of vending machines on the streets of Tokyo.

"Familiarity breeds contempt". What she meant is that when we see something often enough, we begin to accept it as the norm. As the medias continue to seek things with even greater shock value to boost sales, the norm slides ever downward. I see it in my own kids (now grown) They accept things as normal that I have a cat fit about...and they say I am old fashioned. I say they have been brainwashed. I suspect my mother felt the same way about the things I thought were cool....like Elvis for example.|`|CVVl4U4caa	No, its their own fault plus their parents.

I6nopGJJaa	Dictadura, forma de gobierno en cual el poder se concentra en una sola figura (persona), pueden ser autoritarias, totalitarias, facistas y una combinacion de estas ejemplos bien conocidos<br>  Autoritaria: Weinmar, Alemania<br>  Totalitarias: Stalin, Fidel, Somoza<br>  Facistas: Mussolini, Hitler la lleva hasta las ultimas consecuencias.<br>  Otro ejemplo de combinaciones anteriores fue <br>  El Generalisimo rafael leonidas Trujillo, terminando en una Dictadura Constitucional.<br>  Suceden, por grupos, golpes de estado, grupos militares (en fin una pandilla x asi decirlo) El pueblo debe pensar y vivir como le es dictado.<br>  Democracia:Forma de gobierno directa o indirecta por el pueblo un eufeminismo de democracia se entiende por "Libertad".<br>  Aunque hay controles que en algunos casos son convenientes para que no se forme la Anarquia hay otros controles que tambien son excesivos y con los cambios de constitution o partidos se van probando los sistemas, leyes o resoluciones que ayuden la democracia mas plena. Un ejemplo aunque no es perfecta la democracia de los Estados Unidos es el espejo del mundo, aunque se hagan marcha protestando en contra del sistema politico de lo que hoy es la potencia mundial. El pueblo puede pensar y actuar libremente de acuerdo a las reglas de juego.<br>  Tambien hay grupos afines, colegio electoral(se supone sea imparcial) grupos politicos o de interes (comerciales, militares, etc)<br>  No te pude conseguir el cuadro comparativo pero dejame descrbirtelo un poquito:<br>  Las democracias son mas estables socialmente con el goce de libertad, "hacer lo que uno quiera mientras pueda y tenga con que hacerlo". El pais que la promueva sera prospero o va en camino de serlo.<br>  Las dictaduras parecen ser la antipoda de las democracias y duran anos pero no por eso son estables en libertad (en algunos casos hay ciertas restricciones donde se vigilan los opositores o se le esconden o desaparecen) hay control ferreo no solo local sino nacional y se discrimina mas a los nacionales que a los extranjeros.<br>  La Politica interior es muy diferente a la exterior pero a expensas de la anterior. La Politica exterior es el escudo y defensa de su dictadura en contra de su o sus enemigos para que nadie la haga tambalear y seguir en el poder por la eternidad si le fuera posible.<br>  Tanto en la Dictadura como en la democracia hay sus ventajas y desventajas.<br>  Si me das a elegir me quedo con la Democracia, no es cuestion de ricos y pobres sino de dignidad humana y pensamiento libre. <br>  La decision de las personas sera de acuerdo a como le toque bailar.|`|nDENlr0kaa	en la democracia el gobierno le teme al pueblo en la dictadura el pueblo le teme al gobierno.|`|iGHCflgoaa	Haz tu tarea!|`|fa83811f1c8efc3d346550599d36f12caa	Para el pueblo que debe sufrir a sus gobernantes dictadores o democráticos no hay mucha diferencia.<br>  <br>  ::

Dr6nCsZ3aa	Yes, as long as they are not on parole for a crime that included alcohol.|`|AA11622716	Alcohol is subject to state regulation, not universal laws.  I don't know of any states that prohibit a felon from serving booze, but I do not know every law in every state and country.|`|uSeApMt9aa	Yes. In fact i know a few rehabilitated felons that are bartenders.
AA12109395	Since you are paying court - ordered child support and you are talking about a permanent move, you can petition the court to prevent the move to recognize your rights for visitation.  Look at the original order, there may even be a clause in the original order that says she cannot leave the state permanently with the child and by doing so would be violating the order.|`|AA11622716	Unless there is an order prohibiting her from leaving, she can leave.  If there is no such order, and you want one, you can apply to the court to get one.  Most courts would still allow her to go but would order few visists for longer periods, such as for vacations.|`|Dr6nCsZ3aa	NO. She can not move out of state with your child without your permission.
MRasxuTZaa	You have a work visa, right?  Unless another company solicits your employment and it is adjudicated as approved you will have to return home if the company that you now work for no longer needs your services...or get married and adjust status that way.  Good luck.
014NXPfFaa	It probably wont prevent you from joining, but it will likely have an impact on your security clearances - especially if you have a job that requires top seceret.  It's very likely that it will be in your personnel file at your old job, and your previous employ will share that with the investigator...  The military and social security numbers go hand in hand, so if they have any reason to think they can't trust you with knowing that info, it would cause problems...|`|htaxf1jJaa	nah, as long as you don't have a perminent record you're fine.|`|k76mr7rKaa	It might come up when they do a background check for the security clearance, but other than that I can't see that affecting your enlistment.

I would not want to offend when using it in a personal way. I did use it in the past to describe a friend, thinking it was cool and have since lost that friend, which I regret. It felt exotic to me and I liked the sound of it, but I think my friend did not. I put an "a" rather than an "o" at the end, which the spellchecker would not let me do here. To be fair we did have other differences but I really was fond of her and thought we'd always be close.<br>  She was polite about it but in retrospect, I think I blew her away.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	Mulatto is no longer a proper term to use.

t0wOxpPuaa	well i am not sure if 25 percent would be appropriate but there will HAVE TO BE some kind of agreement to replace the millions in population when it comes to every first world country ( and each one of the 25 biggest cities in America ) . just Italia for example its expected to lose as much as 40 percent of its population in the coming decades , which of course will lead to all kind of problems . there is a province over there in which the major started offering 10 000 dollars to all which would have a Baby , try to explain that to the typical u know what and their brains would blow up !, they just would not understand it . <br>  <br>  <br>  what i personally would offer as a solution is to start giving visas to every person which lives in the Brazilian rain forest and every place like that which needs to be protected to go to the first world countries , this would create a win win situation in which everyone would benefit . <br>  <br>  also i think u make an excellent point when u talk about how there is free flow of the Americans from one place to another even though not everyone in the States earns the same .<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT :  i just wanted to comment than in reality moving people from one place to another IS NOT equal to over populating the planet , plus as i already explained the world population is declining in more than one place leaving behind an elderly population in more than one country .... it is also important to mention than as the immigrants integrate into their new home countries the same would start having less children obviously .|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	Great, which sub Saharan African country are you going to as part of the 25%?|`|xagIY1Quaa	No not interested.  That's why we started our own country--to make our own rules.<br>  <br>  Next.|`|2dqQQg41aa	Lets just say for fun that we try your program for ten years.<br>  <br>  And lets assume that nothing else goes wrong - like maybe running out of gasoline, water, space, land, food, etc.<br>  <br>  It will mean that the population of this country would have to grow at least by 3.1 million new immigrants per year.  And immigrants breed far faster then naturalized citizens - about 3+ kids per woman.  So the total impact of your idea would amount to at least 4.5 million per year.  Now we are up to at least 45 million more people here in only ten years.<br>  <br>  If your plan continued for 30-40 years it would likely mean a doubling in this countries population to over 600++++ million as the growth compounds.  That would be a great legacy for your kids huh?<br>  <br>  Just a few pesky little details.  As it stands right now we have the highest rate of population growth EVER IN OUR HISTORY and its virtually all due to immigration.<br>  <br>  Where will we put them?<br>  How can we feed them?<br>  How can we educate them?<br>  How can we provide energy?<br>  Where will the jobs come from?<br>  Who will provide medical to them?<br>  Where will the funds come from to provide sewer systems, landfills, roads, etc.<br>  <br>  The real problem is that most people and most countries cannot see past their own petty wants and needs to overpopulate this world.  The only way to stop this is to:<br>  <br>  1. Stop all immigration - when people realize there is nothing special about breeding and there is no place for the ones we already have then they "might" wake up.<br>  2. Spend the money that immigration costs taxpayers and send birth control to all of those idiotic people who continue to breed without any ability to feed the ones they already have.<br>  <br>  EDIT - <br>  Everyone should read the articles to see just how stupid this question really is.  But the best points are made from the people making comments on the stupid articles - almost every one points out how stupid they are!!!|`|AA11600810	You throw all this out there and then say don't cherry pick it?

Marijuana is actually legal federally to possess but illegal to sell. If your marijuana has a stamp from the ATF (which is literally impossible to get) then it can be sold and possessed. <br>  <br>  However, numerous state laws outlaw both the possession and sale of it. <br>  <br>  Cocaine is illegal because it kills. Any questions?<br>  <br>  Sure, the government should stay out of people's lives. But the laws are on the books for a reason. And yes, the government does care about the citizens. Which is why cocaine is illegal.|`|4f3cjyw7aa	Well, under the Interstate Commerce Clause, congress has the power to regulate "interstate commerce." (Note: the ICC is in the Articles of the Constitution, not in the Bill of Rights) With the New Deal era of the 1930's, the Supreme Court, which was packed with New Dealers, allowed congress to regulate growing crops because they had the possibility of ending up in interstate commerce, therefore the drug laws are constitutional under the Interstate Commerce Clause.<br>  <br>  Love it or hate it, that's how we got where we are.|`|AA12361841	cocaine can kill u and there is no way they can make money on either.

Claiming that 'Bush kept us safe" is a joke. A joke that cost us trillions of dollars and, more importantly, thousands of lives.|`|0eFSeap5aa	No, Bush was not a good president.  This economic mess is directly caused by policies of the Bush administration as well as the actions of those boneheads at the fed, Greenspan and Bernanke.  Mr Bush's predecessor as well as several iterations of Republican and Democrat Senators and Representatives are also to blame.<br>  <br>  Obama is currently dealing with problems not of his making.  The larger even worse problems in our future are or will be the fault of Obama as well as those feckless thieves in Congress.  It's ok to still blame Bush, we can't really blame Obama until his policies blow up, which they will.|`|fsGfQALoaa	The economy is by no means immediate.<br>  It's going down from momentum, not Obamentum.|`|AA12069128	He will go down as one of the bottom five when looked back upon by presidential historians!|`|c8d511b57b38b8ff3a19d1b90168fef3aa	Yes, he was really that bad - why do you think we're facing all the problems that Obama has to clean up?|`|xggSASTwaa	you cant blame that on obama, and you must be one of those folks who thought he would change the whole country the minute he stepped into office??? It would be the same with anyone, the job losses and the stock market were already estimated at this number for this time of the year long before Obama started to run for president. So now you need to realize what kind of man Mr president must be to take on a fight that is sure to be lost before it can be stitched back up. Don't be impatient, trust me. These things take alot of time to fix. Maybe even years. The good news is: our president knows what poverty is like, unlike all the others who grew up with a silverspoon in their mouth, he can relate to those who are struggling and he will not let them down.|`|b21fc34917b458cf7b37456bede7feb9aa	How many times more will we see the government is taking everything over. Are people this stupid and do they never listen. Obama has to prop the banks and auto and whatever else is falling to keep our economy going. If the government does not do it, who will. Answer no one it falls and we have a great depression number 2. So. He said they are not taking complete control is not for it, just to help and them to pay the money back when they get going. If auto places close what a mess that will be. Thousands and thousand and thousand loose jobs. people who make tires, car part, batteries, people who change oil, you name it. Service stations will go out and because doing no repairs on those cars, it is a domino affect. Every business is connected to another. Get it yet????Thank God Obama is doing this to keep us from tanking. We will hear more plans and more bail outs till they can finally float and people loosen up the money. Hang tight, we will get there,|`|DiDCG9UBaa	I always rated Nixon and Reagan as the top two (worst) and figured Bush was just a bumbling idiot. In hindsight I realize he was President during the worst attack on American soil, started a war for absolutely no reason, and left office by giving us a depression. Yeah, he is the worst.|`|C2HHfun2aa	In less than two months Obama has spent $2 trillion in deficit spending which is twice as much as has been spent on the Iraq war so far.<br>  <br>  That $2 trillion is more than the entire federal government was in 1982. If we spent a million dollars a day since Jesus was born today we still would not have spent $2 trillion.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Yep, he was bad.<br>  <br>  You have listed a bunch of correlation.  Unfortunately for you, correlation rarely equates to causation.|`|qHg0c9r4aa	Bushes past doings are the only doings that have gotten us where we are at today, is that really that hard for people to understand. Try having you're own thoughts instead of using what the tv tells you.|`|aXSjRwEVaa	Yes|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	Fact is, so many of the empty minded liberals that haven't caught on yet that the media is biased and has been hiding much of the truth from them, they won't change their mind. They are stuck on what the democrat party has told them to think, they believe CNN, they have no drive to find the truth, they have no conviction, they only want to believe what they do and shoot their mouths off about it.....even if it is a lie and not supported by facts.<br>  They have no clue what Bush actually did, and won't give any credit for what he tried to do. It doesn't matter that many good initiatives were blocked by a politically selfish and partisan group like the democrat party. They've been unsophisticated, uneducated kool-aid drinkers from the start which is where Obama got most of his vote from.<br>  When for instance have any of these little mush minds dared to question just what Obama is doing to freedom and liberty in America... for the supposed purpose of getting us out of the recession ?<br>  He is intituting a plan that doesn't do anything that has been proven to work. Like the stubborn and idiot liberal crowd, its been a push to try once again that liberal policy could work in America....only problem being its not working and has never worked in the past.<br>  Just how far does America have to sink before these idiots learn ? Just how bad does the American citizen have to suffer before we have the right to walk up to DC and physically kick these losers out of office for they do not represent the country or the citizens of it for the most part.<br>  Socialism had destroyed almost every country thus far, and America has always stood out from European countries because we refused to give up our ways and become subserviant to them.<br>  Bush did a decent job, the economy went to hell on the democrats watch. They assumed control of 3 major chairs....in banking and housing included, along with the Congress. That's when the economy sank. Talk about an attention deficeit disorder....I guess the libs forgot that we had 6 good years under Bush before anything bad happened, and truth be told, the economy was starting to shrink under Clinton in his last year.<br>  But look at Obama....took over and the economy has plumetted, the Market is down 4000 points + from his election, people are losing their jobs, their homes and unemployment is up. We have socialism being forced on America since most voted against this bail out junk...but congress still did it. Time to wake up people, Congress is the enemy here.|`|UqLEMXAgaa	Bush left Washington with the same principals he brought with him.<br>  Eight years did not change "W".<br>  <br>  Bush was not a good President.<br>  <br>  None of what you see happening in the world is the fault of President Obama.<br>  <br>  Spending a trillion in America is better than spending it fixing someone else's country.|`|R5RHMIYQaa	Truely, Bush was that bad, although, Obama may be worse, I don't know yet, he hasn't been in long enough to tell.  But, yes, you are correct, the Dow keeps falling.  Obama is looking more so and more so socialist and communist to me as well.  To much government control, I don't like it.|`|AA12378902	Barack Obama has been President for just over one month ----- yet, you're already passing judgment on him!!!   As far as great economic growth, it was big corporations and rich folk, not for everyopne.  We were attacked on 9/11 on HIS WATCH!!!!  He was the worst of all Presidents!|`|aroO5qPTaa	bush sucked donkey ***<br>  case closed.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Under Bush we had (the first 6 years) declining real wages (al the economic growth went into the pockets of the rich--none to the people who did the work)<br>  <br>  Bush caused the needless deaths of 4000 Americans in Iraq--and REFUSED for 7 years to attack Al-Qaida and the Taliban--who are now stronger and a bigger threat than ever. And--have carried out numerous attacks successfully (Madrid and London being two examples)<br>  <br>  We did not "win" the Iraq war. One does not win an immoral butchering of innocent people. One can only stop the butchering. That is not a "victory."<br>  <br>  Economic growth the first 6 years of the Bush administration was lower than under Clinton. And while the conservatives were making money on the stock market, Americans were losing their jobs to China, their health care to rising costs,  and their retirement pensions to corporate greed and dishonesty.<br>  <br>  We are now feeling the really bad effects of Bush's policies. And the unpatriotic conservatives who choose to still defend Bush know it. They still haven't gotten the message: he will not be excused. Neither will the people who betrayed America by supporting him.
BrjZhySIaa	Sorry Ben.... I am responsible for your sole 'thumb down'.  Twas an accident.  I'm with ya.<br>  <br>  <br>  But to answer the question....<br>  <br>  It's because the Obama administration has a hidden agenda that leans toward integrating America into the future one world government.  And they can't have someone who works in the best interest of America at the helm.  <br>  <br>  See, the idea is to break down America's economy through hyperinflation in order to force the population to accept the New World Order.  <br>  <br>  Look no further than what the globalists' godfather, David Rockefeller said:<br>  <br>  "This present window of opportunity, during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world order might be built, will not be open for too long - We are on the verge of a global transformation. All we need is the right major crisis and the nations will accept the New World Order"|`|AA11702773	Thanks for the link.<br>  <br>  Describing the completely whimsical manipulation of fiat money as a natural standard with gold restraint on money an 'artificial' restraint, as if by nature money should do whatever some private group wanted, seems a bit rich.<br>  <br>  His statement noone is seriously discussing a 'super IMF' is a bit odd given this week's statements by the EU that they will be lobbying the US in particular to give sanction authority for regulation of OUR banking system to the IMF.<br>  <br>  I wonder if he didn't know about that or if it just slipped his mind?|`|ae54718496dc216dbde0762324f5ee8caa	Ron Paul appears to be a wise man, and a man who wants the best for America, like freedom, and a strong nation through capitalism, and it's proven that Capitalism works to make strong, healthy economies.<br>  However, as to Obama, it's obvious he does not believe in economic strength for we the people. Every move he has taken thus far can be considered SOCIALISM, and he is trying to take over America, to rule it's citizens, to de-class us, as rich, middle-class, and poor to COMPLETELY poor, making us COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on Government for our livelihoods.<br>  He has interfered by taking control of an entity of government, called the Census Bureau! Why do you think he broke the Constitution and do this?<br>  <br>  To have PERSONAL and PRIVATE information about the public, to know EXACTLY where you are, how you live, whom you associate with, and keep TABS on who is on his side, and those who are against his policies!<br>  WE ARE IN MF TROUBLE, Americans! Big Brother, The Man, any name you choose, is SPYING on us!<br>  <br>  I believe Barack Obama is moving very VERY quickly, not to save American, and world economy, but to OWN this country, and to erase those who would have a voice to contradict his leadership...I am stating this as softly, and directly as possible, but if you want intense, here it is....Socialism is the transition from Capitalism, to COMMUNISM! DO YOU UNDERSTAND, American poor? You voted a controlling tyrant into office who wants to make us slaves!<br>  <br>  Barack Obama-"We must do more to put people back to work, and get our economy moving again," the president-elect said. <br>  <br>  He said his economic priority would be a two-year, nationwide effort to "jumpstart job-creation in America and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy". <br>  <br>  Ageing public infrastructure would be rebuilt, Mr Obama said, adding that his administration would look quickly at developing and building sources of renewable energy, such as wind farms, designed to "free" the US from its "dependency" foreign oil. <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7743571.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7743...</a><br>  <br>  Do you know what kinds of jobs these are America? HARD LABOR jobs, with a LABORER's PAYCHECK! Also, Obama wants us to mine coal, labor work, with a laborer's paycheck.<br>  <br>  Yes, work is good, we should have jobs, we should earn our way of life, but these labor jobs Obama wants us to have, firstly will not last but for two years, and HE is the one paying the checks out to the Laborer's, NOT any Company. Your boss will be the Government! When the labor is done, you're out of a job AGAIN...except I have a strong feeling he'll come up with another for you, and another for your family, and another for your friends, and all will be labor, and ALL paychecks will be from the Government, and the rich will no longer be rich because Obama had taked every dime out of them to pay for your labor check, because the Government makes NO money people! They get money from the WORKING CITIZENS! The rich will be paying your health-care, as well, so, where will the money to run a country come from when the rich like Bill Gates, Bill Cosby, Hollywood elitists, etc. have no more to give? You see, Obama and his personally chosen administration will take the businesses every successful American owns and put it under their control!!!!! The rich, if they haven't already escaped the country, will be digging ditches, mining coal, and waiting in bread lines just like the rest of us. Their money will be GONE eventually.<br>  <br>  OPEN YOUR EYES I BEG YOU AMERICA! Obama and his government have already taken 40% control of two banks, with our monies in them...<br>  <br>  The problem with Socialism, is that eventually the Government runs out of other people's money- Margaret Thatcher<br>  <br>  <br>  The leading plan right now is to create a huge "aggregator" bank to buy bad loans and money-losing securities from troubled lenders to keep them from failing, a gambit that likely would cost taxpayers at least another trillion dollars, and probably more. Approval of this could be the single most expensive decision the new president will make in his entire term.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB123276584057512533.html" rel="nofollow">http://online.barrons.com/article/SB1232...</a><br>  <br>  and, "This administration continues to strongly believe that a privately held banking system is the correct way to go, ensuring that they are regulated sufficiently by this government," White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said when asked about nationalizing the banks.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.howestreet.com/articles/index.php?article_id=8711" rel="nofollow">http://www.howestreet.com/articles/index...</a><br>  <br>  Please folks, answer me this?

We now know that wasn't true!<br>  <br>  Hear Rep. Gregory Meeks, (D) New York say:<br>  I'm just pissed off, If it wasn't for you (speaking to the Republican regulator who informing Congress of the problem) I don't think we would be here in the first place, and now the problem that we have, that were faced with, is maybe some individuals wanted to do away with GSE's in the first place, you've given them an excuse to have this forum to change the direction of GSE's had...which they have done a tremendous job...theres been nothing that was indicated thats wrong with Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac has come up on its own"... he goes on to question the competancy of the Regulator, and says he's upset with him, and accuses the Regulator of maybe giving a reason for heart surgery, when a person doesn't need it..." This statement, wasn't true either...both of these Congress leaders were either lying, or just plain stupid, and do not understand economics. If the truth is they were lying, this means these Democrats are criminals, and have no concern for the taxpaying citizens, and if the latter is true, that they don't understand economics, then our leaders are more than incompetent, they are a DANGER to our Country! THESE DEMOCRATS BANKRUPTED our BANKS! They STOLE the American people's MONEY.<br>  <br>  <br>  Obama and the Democratic controlled Congress are robbing the American taxpayers twice, claiming America is in massive trouble, blaming the banks, rich executives on Wall Street, George W Bush (who along with other Republicans tried to stop the Dem. Congress from forcing banks to give out the loans), the war in Iraq, and anyone, and everything Conservative. They are purposefully scaring the people into believing that Republicans, the banks, and the rich started the recession, and ONLY Obama can save us from total disaster! They did a good job at lying, keeping the stupid, stupid, got their vote, stopped We the People from doing anything more than basic complaining of having to pay to save our country! People, the EXACT SAME Democrats that put us into this recession, YOU Liberals re-elected, and now WE ARE ALL headed STRAIGHT to DEPRESSION, and Obama's promised tax-cut check of $13 a week, isn't going to get us out of THIS mess.<br>  I want Liberals to LOOK themselves in the mirror, and ask themselves, "is receiving money I didn't earn, a promised "tax-cut" for non-working, non-taxpaying citizens by Obama, stolen from my American countrymen and women who labored, and sweated for it, but were given no choice to give or not to, worth the loss of FREEDOM, our Constitution, Bill of Rights, the massive slavery to come, was it worth all the hardships, struggles, sacrifices, and deaths of our forefathers who fought for Freedom, and Liberty, to let it all end for $13 a week? Is $13 a week equal to the price of your soul?<br>  <br>  Naivete in NO excuse! The information has always been available! Barack Obama himself told us before he was elected, hes going to MAKE Taxpayers share the wealth... Taxpayers have ALWAYS WILLING and HAPPILY PAID FOR EDUCATION, FREE for ALL up to 12th grade, free libraries (that's LibRary Libs, not LIBARRY, ok?), and college loans. I guess welfare lifers, and Liberals of today, don't like that kind of free. Education: one actually has to read, and study to use it in life....oh my God, that is WORK! The evil word...Ask yourselves Libs, wait, stop, hold on...They can't.<br>  <br>  <br>  Liberals don't understand what the F I'm talking about, even if they can read.

That's the fundamental objection to capitalism. I don't want to compete, not because I don't want anybody to hurt me, but because I don't want to hurt anybody. We're all capable of so much better. I bet you could write a rough overview for the perfect utopian society if you just kept reminding yourself all the way through, "I don't want to hurt anybody." Try it sometime. Prove me wrong... and when you prove me right then ask yourself, "If that was so easy for me, what kind of people came up with this capitalism thing?"|`|qbQF1AQGaa	Whatchootalkinbout Willis?

Capitalism is good for producing 'stuff'.  It has nothing to do with producing any direct social good or social justice.  The market can and does produce useful articles....has anyone said that it doesn't?  The 'market' also produces toxic waste products that for generations were simply tossed into the nearest river, dumped on the ground or allowed to drift off into the air.  Without 'government intervention' that would still be the case, and in some parts of the world it still is.  Some products are harmful or adulterated or dangerous. Restricting the 'freedom' to poison, shock, burn or sicken the public isn't exactly a bad idea.  It's a darn good idea.  I have to reject your entire premise.  Who says 'democrats' chose some kind of 'least freedom' and 'most government intervention'?  This is a classic strawman argument...are we now suppose to argue FOR  loss of freedom and government intervention?  Way too much right wing radio, bro...way!

All I have read for months is that the Republicans were racist and fought the Civil Rights Acts and then used racism to take the South from the Democrats.  Are you now admitting that the truth is that the Republicans actually did support the Civil Rights movement against Southern Democrats which destroys the other fable that the Republicans pried Southern Democrats away from the Democratic Party because of racism.  Civil liberties can be taken away much more easily then civil rights.  Rights are things in the US which are granted by the Constitution while liberties are granted by law and can be revoked by law.  It is unusual for a liberal to admit the facts are actually correct and the propaganda they state is just fictional stories they use to sway people.  The Republicans could use their promotion of the civil rights movement to get racist Southerners to leave the Democratic Party because the Democrats didn't support the civil rights movement seems to be a rather strange accusation.  The primary reasons for the Democratic Party losing the South was because of economics (Southerners are not in love with labor unions and felt the Democratic Party was giving in too much to the unions headquartered in the North East) and secondly because of the war in Vietnam which Southerners fought in at almost double the rate of there population and did so believing the words of John F Kennedy a conservative hawk that communism must be fought by any and all means regardless of the cost.   The South did not leave the Democratic Party the Democratic Party left the South.

9a65d9649ac752ad9b4eb1c1b2ab2804aa	In a word, no.<br>  <br>  Theoretically, escort services offer only companionship -- not sex.  That is why they are legal.  In practice, many (but not all) escort services are really fronts for prostitution.  However, paying for sex from an "escort" is just as illegal as paying for sex from a prostitute who does not hold herself out as an escort.<br>  <br>  If you are "desperate to lose [your] virginity," I would advise you to either go to a jurisdiction where prostitution is legal (e.g. a legal Nevada brothel), or form a relationship with someone who is not a prostitute.  Whatever you do, and whoever you do it with, use a condom.  HIV is far less pleasant than being a virgin.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Don't be so desperate.

Mhm3J5g0aa	Because Feminists can't make up their mind ?<br>  When the move started, it sought for equal pay, equal treatment and power for women to be equals...........aside from the 20's of woman sufferage in regards to voting.....the "equality" hadn't progressed in regards to work place ethics, treatment, pay, etc.<br>  But now days we see it has become nothing more than a sounding brass for those with big mouths and a political entity.<br>  Otherwise...why did they side with Bill Clinton rather than defend the women that him and Hilary sought to destroy to keep their reps ?<br>  Why isn't there more support for the Iraqie war where women are honor killed and treated like secondary citizens ?<br>  Too many times you have episodes where woman have gone just to crush some rule or tradition that prevented woman from entering...like the Presideo.....but after that event...they quit. Its one thing to tear down the walls of a discriminating institution for the sake of clearity and progress, but its quite another to misuse or abuse a political power to show boat and create a scene when there was no reason to do so.

Men have more testosterone than women, that is why we are more stronger than women.  That is why there are no women in men's sports.  They can't compete because they are not as built as men.

H4PQ8nsfaa	I like the Answer which says that "The British have a system that is similar to the Canadian Westminster model" Talk about roll on florr laughing !!!! I think you'll find it's Other way around Old Boy. Anyway .....moving on :-<br>  <br>  The difference between the Federal US and the non-federal UK is harder to distinguish since devolution.The key may be where does Sovereign power reside ? <br>  <br>  By Sovereign power I mean the totality of legislative administrative and executive power in one political entity.In a Federal State soverign power may be shared in a two tier system where each member state of the federation is a sovereign state but has pooled or ceded some of its sovereign power to an overriding political structure for certain purposes e.g every State in the US has its own constitution albeit derived from the US one.Remember that originally the US was a voluntary association of English colonies.<br>  <br>  In England the Sovereign power is "the Queen in Parliament" so in our constitutional theory sovereign power is unitary even though we have a clear separation of powers within a single state defined in part by the Acts of Union.<br>  <br>  So the short answer is that the form of the US state is explicitly Federal and consists in constitutional and legal theory of a free Union of sovereign states with pooled sovereignty in certain areas administered central;y.<br>  <br>  The UK has a central unitary national authority but with certain governmental functions delegated to in effect regions of the Kingdom but which doe no have formal legal or constitutional sovereignty as such.|`|2PglNTjAaa	The British have a system that is similar to the Canadian Westminster model.  They have a House of Lords who comprise the upper house, who are not elected, but are born of peerage, and clergymen of the Anglican Church.  They do not have a full system of democracy like the United States where everyone is elected from the will of the people recognizing that we are all born equal.  United States therefore has a more of a fair system of government where people are not born into privilege, but get elected and must win their position on meritocracy.|`|a4f625e9943640ad9aec7382d7bcfe89aa	In a federal system of government  the separate states have their own legislature make laws with a federal government who can overrule them if the laws don't fall under the constitution they also make federal laws covering all states, in the UK devolved authority's are only allowed to operate under act of parliament from Westminster and these acts can be revoked at any time.Local by laws may differ in different parts of the country but this is because local authority's are using what is called parent legislation passed by parliament which gives them power to initiate laws  but not do entirely as they wish..|`|8ivnzNi5aa	The Cabinet positions are presidential appointments, considered subordinate to the executive.<br>  <br>  The way a federal system is supposed to work is for the states to be able to experiment with different approaches to solving problems, so long as the approaches do not conflict with the agreed-upon constitution.  Since at least the1990's, the central government in Washington has been usurping more power from the states by passing laws with unfunded spending mandates.  It's getting to the point over here in the US that as many as 21 states have filed declarations of sovereignty with Congress, but I don't know what if any effect that will have on anything.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	A federal system is where several states join to form a national government which takes control of common issues, whilst still leaving the states to control their own individual internal affairs.<br>  The UK does not have separate states, although it is a union of individual countries, that are constitutionally ruled over by a single monarchy. Recent laws to create parliaments for Wales and Scotland still does not make it a federation, because they are still recognised as countries, not states.
hmjAwZQEaa	You have answered your own question. Westminster runs UK, Governors run most things in the usa not the president and his cabinet<br>  <br>  Prime minister runs the uk with the backing of parliament<br>  it's that way to stop a monarch taking control of the people again<br>  president doesnt run the usa.<br>  the uk is made up of 4 countries<br>  in these countries there are counties, these counties don't have governors or independant practices independant laws etc in the uk laws are the same throughout except scotland which has a few different laws introduced by thir own parliament (which is still governed by westminster)<br>  america is made up of states run by the governors.<br>  <br>  don't know if that helps but i have to stop as i am confusing myself.<br>  my head hurts<br>  <br>  because if the us government done that is wouldn't be a federal republic. the us govt. still takes care of the major decisions that  effect the country as a whole|`|FXniymT6aa	because its a molarky|`|809fe92a5e8a388fd9915476812d008caa	In a nutshell the US is a federal state because initially the US was formed from 13 British colonies that rebelled against British rule. The colonies were all separate entities that wanted to remain largely autonomous and the initial US constitution (called the articles of the confederation) created an extraordinarily weak central government that had essentially no control over any of the American states. Eventually this was junked when it was realized that some centralization was necessary, and the current US Constitution (the one everyone calls 'the Constitution') was adopted. It created a more powerful central government, but explicitly limited that government's powers. An amendment to the US constitution also grants all powers not explicitly in the Constitution to the states (or the people themselves). So in a nutshell in the US there is an explicit division between federal and state power. State governments have quite a lot of power and are not dependent on the fed govt for revenues. Compare this to a Westminster system that is centralized--Parliament can do whatever it wants and any devolution of power is at the whim of the central govt.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|AA12205273	No, the Queen is sovereign, not parliament. The citizens are subjects. She also has a governor general that works in her behalf. For example Canada and Australia are confederation. The governor general can dissolve the government when necessary, not parliament.<br>  Confused? Try finding The Economist on line, they have discussed this subject often.<br>  The queen has signed the EU constitution, only to be saved by the Irish! Once in the EU, she will lose all sovereignty.|`|m4G9jqgPaa	In a federation, the federal government can make laws that affect common issues across state lines, and are for the national interest. It cannot make laws that affects a state's internal issues, unless that state requests federal intervention. Each state has it's own constitution, that enshrines the rights of the state citizens. The State can create it's own laws for internal administration.<br>  In the UK, which is a Constitutional Monarchy, there is only one national constitution, and the national government creates all the laws of the land.<br>  The various local Councils can only make local regulations within the parameters of those laws.|`|twdXT5wOaa	Just a wee correction here - the United Kinngdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a federal state, with a few anomalies.<br>  <br>  There is a legislative assembly or parliament, and an executive, in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,  although England has to make do with the uk Parliament and Executive in London. Poor old English...<br>  <br>  The devolved administrations have responsibility for such policy areas as health, education, housing, transport, internal finance, etc.<br>  <br>  The UK executive is responsible for foreign policy, defence etc - plus the policy areas covered by the devolved administrations, in respect of England.<br>  <br>  As to the suspension by the UK Parliament/executive of a devolved legislature - that is a legal possibility, and it did actually happen in Northern Ireland, when the country was close to civil war.  This may be of interest to US history buffs, as there are certain parallels up to a point - and it was at this point that you lot did, of course, fight a civil war.<br>  <br>  However, the fact that Northern Ireland is small and bitterly divided made it possible in that instance - I am quite certain that an attempt to do so in Scotland's case would instantly spark a declaration of independence, and could even cause a civil war (or war of independence, if you want to put it that way).<br>  <br>  By the way, to the person who described us as 'subjects', we are not.  Our passports read 'Citizen'.  And the constitutional theory is that the Queen in Parliament is sovereign - not the Queen.  We had to make a king a head shorter a few hundred years ago to establish that point.<br>  <br>  Best wishes to all you Colonials!

A copy goes to the contractor and also to the IRS. It gives me their name, business name (if they have one), and social security number or business ID so the government can track that they claim on their taxes the same amount that I claim to have paid them during the year. The bank will probably give her a 1099 on the interest she earns from her savings account and she would have to pay taxes on that. Not all of the money in the account, only the interest, which if it's a regular savings account, she probably won't make enough money to have to pay taxes on it anyway.<br>  It's not a tax exemption form it's a form for taxes.

If you are a dem there is nothing else that I can think of that would help that party more then allowing for more immigration and an amnesty for illegals.  Of course the long term effects on this country would be disastrous.  A country cannot take in predominately uneducated masses when we have a heavy social program system that is funded by taxpayers.  It will lead to higher taxes, more wealthy people fleeing or hiding their money and social unrest.  We already have no ability to provide water, electricity, natural gas, etc. to the people we already have.  No technology will allow us to keep pace with the legal immigration numbers we already have so what will happen if the illegals are suddenly given citizenship?

Where there are no more nations only a one world government that dictates the laws and people are forced to live with differential races, cultures and religions. It's largely practiced in western countrys after the WWII it started in Europe, America, Australia. I believe it's part of an agenda to form a borderless global and create global citizenship. Just like in europe they already trying to destroy the European nations by forming the EU and in American there is talk of North America Union, merging Canada, US and Mexico together. In Asian there is also talk of Asian Union, this explains the mass immigration of Asians to australia. So they are preparing everyone for this global government. The issue's that come with it crime, tension is largely ignored by the government as they want to form this order, and will deal with issue's later on.

b7f3fbe5a9076d8b9f53cba7ec8315dbaa	El poeta Raúl Rivero: "Lo más grave de Cuba es la pobreza moral" <br>  Es un símbolo de la disidencia. Estuvo 20 meses encarcelado y acaba de ser liberado. Le dijo a Clarín que saldría de la isla para conocer a su nieta. No le han dado permiso. <br>  Raúl Rivero, el "poeta maldito" cubano, escritor, periodista y símbolo de la disidencia, habla con una velocidad tremenda mientras se acompa?a del suave movimiento de una mecedora blanca. Está aprovechando el poco tiempo que los periodistas le dejamos libre para ponerse al corriente en la lectura de cartas y mensajes recibidos en sus 20 meses de prisión. Recién liberado, da la impresión de que no quiere complicaciones, sólo trabajar como lo hacía antes de su arresto junto a otros 75 disidentes; antes de su condena a 20 a?os de cárcel. <br>  <br>  —Lo liberan con una "licencia indefinida" por salud, aunque su enfisema y las piedras en el ri?ón no son tan graves. ?Es una libertad definitiva? <br>  <br>  —Legalmente no lo es. Pero no se me dijo cómo debía ser mi conducta fuera de la cárcel. Me estoy comportando como me dicta el corazón. Me preguntan si se me sugirió irme de Cuba, pero realmente ha sido lo contrario. Que yo podía hacer mi vida normal aquí, como otros cubanos que entran y salen. Como un escritor. Quisiera sí salir y volver, porque hace 15 o 16 a?os que no me dejan salir de Cuba. Tengo una nieta que no conozco y hace diez a?os que no veo a mi hija. <br>  <br>  —?Influyó en su liberación la gestión de Espa?a?<br>  <br>  —Sí, ya dije que estaré eternamente agradecido, también con José María Aznar porque cuando nos detuvieron a todos Europa tomó medidas duras. Sin aquello hoy no hubiera habido nada que negociar. Eso ha permitido que ahora José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero pueda tomar posiciones más mesuradas. <br>  <br>  —?Piensa salir definitivamente del país?<br>  <br>  —Lo estoy estudiando. Estoy viendo qué va a pasar. Tengo una leve inclinación a que en algún momento me voy a tener que ir. Quiero seguir escribiendo. Hacer un artículo que usted me pida y yo le doy mi opinión honesta y firmándola en el país donde nací. Sin limitaciones.<br>  <br>  —?Teme no poder trabajar a su gusto?<br>  <br>  —Exactamente. O que me dejen y después esos textos puedan servir para volver a la cárcel.<br>  <br>  —?Cómo se define: disidente u opositor?<br>  <br>  —Yo soy un escritor. Un periodista cubano que vive aquí y que quisiera poder trabajar normalmente en su país. Estrictamente en espa?ol, sí lo soy, porque yo disiento de muchas cosas, de mi familia y de mis amigos. El hecho de que una persona no sea comunista no quiere decir que sea anticubano, viva donde viva. <br>  <br>  —?Cómo fueron sus condiciones de vida en la cárcel?<br>  <br>  —El primer a?o estuve incomunicado, fueron once meses en una celda de castigo. Hablábamos entre los presos, pero no nos veíamos. Me sacaban una hora al día a un soleador individual, custodiado y esposado. Al final, ya podía ver TV, leer el periódico, incluso tener una biblioteca. Yo prestaba libros a otros reclusos. <br>  <br>  —?Qué lección le deja la prisión?<br>  <br>  —Una gran amargura. Son dos a?os de mi vida. Ahora tengo idea de lo que vale un a?o en la vida de una persona. Nunca antes había estado en prisión. Fueron muchos sufrimientos, también para la familia, para mi madre que tiene 85 a?os, para mi mujer. Pero como escritor y periodista fue una experiencia insustituible y enriquecedora. Conozco ahora mejor a los cubanos. Para un escritor es una experiencia que no le deseo a nadie, pero que aprovecharé en mi trabajo.<br>  <br>  —?Cómo esta la disidencia?<br>  <br>  —Tengo poca información, pero creo que la razia contra nosotros golpeó a la disidencia. Fue como un freno repentino, una llamada de atención. Casi no he hablado con nadie. <br>  <br>  —?El exilio de Miami es una alternativa para Cuba? <br>  <br>  —Hay que tener siempre en cuenta al exilio porque es una parte de la población cubana, son cubanos; me parece una torpeza negar eso, aunque se les ponga la etiqueta de cubano-americanos o hispano-cubanos, o lo que sea. <br>  <br>  —?Qué cree del trabajo de su esposa y las otras de la organización Damas de Blanco?<br>  <br>  —Yo estaba preocupado por ella, por represalias contra ella o las demás mujeres. Yo le pedía que no politizara esa posición, que se mantuviera con que era la esposa de un hombre que está preso. De todas formas, estando uno preso lo más importante es saber que alguien está acordándose de ti porque la prisión es una especie de muerte provisional: estás encerrado y sabes que la vida pasa pero tu no estás muerto, estas fuera de la vida. <br>  <br>  —?Pudo escribir en prisión?<br>  <br>  —Escribí de todo, pero sólo podía sacar poemas de amor. Conservé todos los escritos. Nunca traté de sacarlos. <br>  <br>  —?Seguirá escribiendo como siempre, sin autocensura? <br>  <br>  —El paso por la prisión tampoco me va a limitar a decir lo que yo creo. Ni voy a empezar a elogiar cosas en las que no creo. <br>  <br>  —?De qué va a vivir? <br>  <br>  —Hasta ahora yo siempre he vivido de los artículos, ahí están las facturas. Si yo gano 100 dólares por un artículo que me pagan en el Herald ahora mismo, y llevo ocho a?os haciendo eso, y hago cuatro al mes.<br>  <br>  —?Qué opina sobre las últimas restricciones de Washington contra la isla?<br>  <br>  —Siempre el gobierno convierte a EE.UU. en el culpable de la situación complejísima de pobreza que hay aquí. Dicen aquí que Bush define el nivel de la familiaridad a la gente. Pero eso empezó aquí. Cuando estaba prohibido escribir a los familiares del exterior. Yo no soy bobo ni soy extranjero, vivo aquí hace 59 a?os. Hace a?os a la persona que vivía en Cuba y le escribía a una tía vieja de Miami, era considerado un enemigo del gobierno. Y no se puede hablar de una emigración normal porque a ningún mexicano que se va a EE.UU. le confiscan la casa y le impiden que vuelva a México.<br>  <br>  —Pero las medidas de Bush perjudican económicamente a las personas. <br>  <br>  —Eso es muy molesto, pero lo más grave no son los problemas materiales o las carencias. Lo más grave es la pobreza moral. Uno puede reconstruir una calle, pero no puede reconstruir un sentimiento. Y las mismas personas a las cuales nos prohibieron tratar y escribir ahora obligatoriamente hay que amarlas porque son los que envían 40 dólares al mes. La gente se indigna por no poder recibir dinero, pero habría que indignarse por no tener un trabajo decente que le permita a uno vivir decentemente, sin robar, sin estafar y sin enga?ar para mantener tu familia. <br>  <br>  —?Se atreve a predecir el futuro de Cuba? <br>  <br>  —No, pero puedo decir lo que creo que grandes sectores de la población quieren. Que se abran las puertas, que haya un pensamiento plural, se respete la soberanía individual, que la gente tenga una alternativa decente de trabajar. También decidir qué tipo de educación le doy a mi hija. <br>  <br>  —?Qué premios que ha recibido agradece más, como poeta o activista?<br>  <br>  —Como poeta, sin dudarlo.|`|OGrA1txzaa	En Cuba el único político que existe es Fidel Castro, otra cosa diferente es que cuando Castro desaparezca este se?or que has nombrado pueda llegar a ser político.

54bdee6decfc577a919642abf0a40a31aa	Tal y como han respondido los amigos, no es sintomático del cono sur, constituye una de las caracterizaciones de la democracia imperfecta que está cundiendo en todo el mundo.<br>  <br>  Me permitiré emitir mi opinión desde una perspectiva más metodológica, mire usted, si partimos de que la organización administrativa de un Estado reconoce por lo general 3 niveles (nacional, provincial y local), estos límites no resultan necesariamente coincidentes con la regionalización cultural, y mucho menos con el criterio globalizador que se caracteriza por el tendido eficiente de redes (tecnológicas, de comunicación y de transferencia económica... por eso casi todos los convenios y tratados internacionales dirigen sus inversiones a estos rubros).<br>  <br>  El problema surge en cuanto la red trabaja de manera eficiente y sin permear sus beneficios a las regiones por las que atraviesa, y los gobiernos locales, por lo general, desconocen los mecanismos para hacer que las redes también trabajen en provecho de las circunscripciones locales.<br>  <br>  Así, son dos lógicas de organización que se yuxtaponen o coinciden, mas no que se sincreticen, de ahí que ante un problema que incida en la región o en la circunscripción local, y que no afecte a la red, genera un sentido encontrado que desde la perspectiva ciudadana recae en un principio de desigualdad ("?por qué a la región sí le afecta y a la red no?... ?por qué mientras mi región perdió la cosecha, la red petrolera que por ahí pasa registra un aumento en su producción?... ?por qué los ni?os de mi municipio se mueren de frío y en cambio, la construcción de la carretera que atraviesa este lugar continúa con éxito?").<br>  <br>  La globalización ha tenido estas serias implicaciones a nivel local, y sin embargo, he visto pocos autores que se concentraran en aducir a mecanismos de concertación, casi todos los artículos que he leído se dedican a demostrar esta desigualdad, pero muy pocos realmente se concentran en instrumentar una solución desde la esfera institucional (serio problema); pero como dije líneas arriba, forma parte de nuestra democracia imperfecta.<br>  <br>  ?Propósitos? Irrumpir en el ámbito de influencia de la red para posibilitar un efecto real y sentido de presión social. Hay un caso mexicano (que tal vez levante ámpulas si un paisano mío lee esto) alusivo a las invasiones a las carreteras por la construcción de un aeropuerto cerca de la Ciudad de México, situación que fué aducida mediáticamente por un problema de identidad e igualdad social al advertir que los manifestantes, llevaban por consigna su inconformidad y un machete en la mano, esto frente a los granaderos con equipo especial, que a todas luces, mostraba una inequidad de fuerzas ante una posible confrontación. Esta situación generó una presión mediática sin precedentes, y de acuerdo con estudios especializados en el caso (instituciones y colegios de investigación), resultó que el trasfondo no consistía en un problema cultural de la región (tal y como los medios y artículos en revistas lo mostraron), nada más alejado, el motivo radicó en un desacuerdo por el precio por metro cuadrado que querían fijar los ejidatarios (inconformes después) para proceder con la expropiación de estas tierras, y así, posibilitar la construcción de un equipamiento, en este caso, el aeropuerto, que conllevaría a un desarrollo a otro nivel y al fortalecimiento de la red de telecomunicaciones. Hé ahí un caso de inconformidad local contra el desarrollo de una red, y estoy segura que casos así, hay bastantes en Latinoamérica.|`|3988179e4511b57d74c244f1c39a9f39aa	La verdad ya es tan común que haya cortes, que es muy confuso y difícil comprobar quien realmente tiene una causa justa, y quien no.<br>  Lo que creo es que está mal que haya tanta protesta, el bien personal en este momento en Argentina prevalece contra el bien común de la gente, entonces porque 50 personas cortan una avenida importante porque exigen "derechos" cientos de miles de personas llegan tarde al trabajo, a sus estudios, a ver a un familiar que está muriéndose, o quizás mueren en una ambulancia por no llegar a tiempo... está bien, sus derechos de manifestarse, ?y mis derechos de ciudadano, de poder caminar por la calle segura, de no tener que hacer rodeos de horas por los cortes, dónde están?<br>  este país es un descontrol.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Pienso que esa medida no sólo se toma en Argentina sino en otros países del mundo como en Venezuela, pienso a modo particular que es un MéTODO DE HACERSE LLAMAR LA ATENCIóN o que le PRESTEN ATENCIóN LOS ENTES GUBERNAMENTALES PARA TAL FIN.

9HU0Wm0Taa	El populismo mesiánico de los políticos de derecha e izquierda es exactamente el mismo. Asociar la palabra socialismo  con la idea de que por ser socialista el fulano sí me va a cumplir es un caldo de cultivo apropiado para las masa necesitadas de justicia falaz.

Precisamente, creo que es el pais con mayor influencia y devoción capitalista del conosur.<br>  Uruguay, tiene a un presidente que proviene de la izquierda y con un antecedente como Intendente de Montevideo, donde se identifica con el Partido Comunista formando el Frente Amplio creado por Seregni. Sin embargo, fijate como claudicó con la pauta de inversiones finlandesas en el caso de las Papeleras. Un gobierno socialista jamás hubiese hecho semejante jugada. E incluso, es el único pais de la región que apuesta al ALCA, siendo sede del Mercosur. <br>  <br>  Alan García de Perú, fue un socialdemócrata en su primera presidencia allá por el 83, cuando dijo que pagaría la deuda externa con el 10% del PBI.

La última vez le salió tan mal, que apareció el Chino Fujimori...<br>  <br>  Brasil, no está gobernado por aquel dirigente gremial llamado Lula Dasilva, que apoyaba a "los sin tierra" y a las reinvidicaciones metalurgicas.

5l0Hko4Taa	Es interesante el hecho de que en las marchas del oficialismo casi no se ve presencia policial, mucho menos de la Guardia NaZional, ?será porque ellos saben que nosotros, en la oposición, NUNCA vamos a perturbarle sus marchas-concentraciones a diferencia de lo que ellos siempre hacen con las nuestras con motorizados y grupos de choque?.<br>  <br>  No, no creo que sea casualidad, tiene perfecta lógica, en las marchas del gobierno no se ve presencia de los cuerpos de seguridad porque lo cierto es que nosotros NO infiltramos gente en sus marchas, ni les salimos en una esquina con un montón de motorizados encapuchados.<br>  <br>  En las marchas de la oposición vemos, Policías Municipales, Regionales y Guardia NaZional, ?por qué?, porque a ellos les urge: intimidarnos, cercarnos y si aun así no estamos disuadidos a abandonar nuestras protestas pues repriminirmos como lo han hecho en múltiples oportunidades durante la última semana.|`|SGsI8Eonaa	No es casualidad, si tu observas los videos de ambas marchas, conseguirás que en todas las marchas de la oposición llegan los chavistas extremos a sabotear y a perturbar tratando de intimidar a quienes hacemos oposición, claro, eso es cuando una Minoria que hace eco de los llamados del Sr. Presidente a bajar de los cerros (porque además los trata como si fueran los cachifos de su revolución) se dirigen hasta donde estemos concentrados, sin mencionar que las fuerzas de orden publico estan totalmente politizadas y al servicio del régimen. Pero cuando hay concentraciones de los oficialistas, entonces no ves a nadie de la oposición saboteando porque nosotros si somos tolerantes y respetamos la disidencia. Al contrario en esas marchas ves a los efectivos del orden publico, en menor cantidad pero al servicio de los que se les ofrezca. Mejor busquen explicación de como fue cerrada la Autopista Regional del Centro por la Guardia Nacional para evitar que llegaran a Caracas los estudiantes de las demás Universidades del interior y de como llegaron el sábado autobuses de oficialistas, hasta de Yaracay y del quinto carrizo. Es obvio la justicia y las fuerzas de orden público estan compradas con petrodólares y las bandas de choque de motorizados estan pagados con su bozal-arepa, asi es como se administra la democracia aqui. <br>  <br>  PD: Para Silvia, te recuerdo que escribir en mayúsculas es el equivalente a gritar, deja el stress te puede dar una úlcera.

Cuando se avisa que se va a realizar una marchar de la oposición SALEN CORRIENDO LOS CHAVIZTAS TAMBIEN A HACER OTRA MARCHA Y ASI BUSCAR PROBLEMAS.<br>  <br>  Pero no se dan cuenta que los marginales y busca pleito son ellos, son PUROS RESENTIDOS SOCIALES y la prueba la tienes en algunas respuestas que te han dado, INSULTANDOTE. <br>  <br>  Cuando hacen marcha los chavizta ahi vez tú a la guardia, a la policia etc cuidandolos en cambio a la otra no.

d31456a49cc76ce06ac946ee089b1971aa	El socialismo o comunismo se ha aplicado durante muchos a?os. Pocos quedan de aquel pasado. Ahora, cuando se habla de socialismo, no se piensa en Marx y en la sociedad sin clases, sino que la gente piensa en Stalin, en los campos de trabajo, en las purgas, en la dictadura, en la prohibición de la libertad, la ausencia de democracia, la prohibición de disidir políticamente.<br>  Yo soy partidario de la primavera de Praga, en la que el presidente checo, comunista, introdujo cambios intentando un socialismo democrático. Sin embargo la URSS lo consideró peligroso y acabó derrocándolo.<br>  El mayor problema ahora está en la gente. No en los partidos. Ahora los partidos han elegido la vía del capitalismo social (psoe, psd, psf, etc) o comunismo democrático (pce dentro de iu q acepta la democracía, pcf, partido de la izquierda alemán, etc).<br>  La gente no vota a los partidos comunistas porque no comprende que si les votase ahora no habría dictadura. No se dan cuenta de que los partidos comunistas ya no quieren eso, que incluso ellos critican a stalin y a la dictadura. <br>  No es problema de q la gente no acepte el modelo económico del comunismo, sino q no acepta la dictadura del comunismo, y piensa que si votase al partido comunista se volvería a una dictadura. Ese es el pensamiento a evitar. Si se vota ahora a un partido comunista, no va a haber dictadura, sino que, en caso de que ganase, habría democracia, la vivienda sería un derecho, no un mercado, no habría mendigos, no habría paro, la educación sería pública, al igual que las empresas...<br>  Por otra parte lo mejor sería aplicar el modelo trotskista de revolución mundial. Exportar el comunismo, el comunismo que ahora promulgan los partidos comunistas, a todo el mundo. Si en todos los países ganasen los partidos comunistas actuales, no habría gente que en busca de riquezas, de querer vivir por encima de los demás, de tener más dinero del necesario, emigrase, pues todos los países serían iguales, serían comunistas, y así se evitaría el deseo materialista del ser humano.<br>  Por desgracia la gente no comprende que votar a los comunistas no es votar a dictaduras. ójala se den cuenta de que no es así. Cuando la situación del capitalismo se haga más insoportable de lo que ya es, y la gente empieze a votar a partidos más a la izquierda, tal vez entonces se den cuenta de que comunismo no es dictadura. Al menos no el comunismo que promulgan ahora los partidos comunistas.|`|574d1f30c96730ec536c11ab274287fdaa	Democracia Real, tampoco existe, lo que existe es un democracia a medias.|`|I6nopGJJaa	Democracia: Poder del pueblo (representativa)<br>  Socialismo:Justicia social para el pueblo (representativa)<br>  Nacionalsocialismo(Nazi): justicia social nacional (representativa)<br>  Socialdemocrata:Mezcla de lo anterior tendecia moderada<br>  Comunismo: El bien comun para todos (represnetativa)<br>  Teorias y pragmatismo ideal y bonitas<br>  Practica: (Falacia, oligarquia estructurada) Politica exterior columna vertebral, politica interior, migajas bien estructuradas para los fieles, control o apresamiento de opositores, libertad restrigida o controlada.<br>  Sumario: Capitalismo centralizado|`|d7e8ee1404415f88719ca70f80b87d10aa	Estoy de acuerdo con Cindy, el socialismo es utopía.

Ha habido casos más o menos próximos en el "socialismo autogestionario" yugoslavo de Tito y en la Nicaragua sandinista, pero en ambos se seguía sin llegar a la democracia. Sin embargo, a nivel local hay numerosas experiencias como las comunidades de población en resistencia (CPR) de Guatemala -sin duda un modelo de democracia interna y de organización comunitaria digna de todo elogio, pues mantuvieron un altísimo nivel organizativo en unas condiciones muy adversas por la represión antiguerrillera-, la autogestión de Villa El Salvador en los suburbios de Lima o algunas cooperativas indígenas en distintos países. <br>  Precisamente el socialismo real a veces encuentra serios adversarios en grupos más o menos cercanos al llamado "socialismo real". Un ejemplo concreto fue el atentado contra Elena Moyano, conocida por Madre Coraje, en el que Sendero Luminoso la acribilló a balazos en presencia de su hijo peque?o y después le lanzó una bomba para que no quedara nada de la mujer que logró extender el vaso de leche a los ni?os y ni?as de Villa El Salvador. Los terroristas vieron su iniciativa como un manera de adormecer la conciencia revolucionaria del pueblo, lo que no sabían es que en este suburbio se ha logrado hacer una economía alternativa que está favoreciendo a las clases populares y que de una primera acción con rasgos paternalistas ha ido creciendo una conciencia crítica hacia las obligaciones que el Estado tiene con su pueblo. <br>  Numerosos partidos comunistas del Este europeo, lejos de aplicar un socialismo real cuando estaban en el poder, ahora sólo se desprenden de su etiqueta "comunista" y se acogen a otras como "democráticos" o "socialistas" pero siguen siendo poco demócratas y lo único que han cambiado es la aceptación del capitalismo (pero no de la democracia). Entre ellos podemos citar al Partido Socialista Serbio (uno de los principales instigadores de la guerra en Yugoslavia), que no ha dudado en aliarse con el ultraderechista Partido Radical Serbio cuando le ha convenido; al Frente de Salvación Nacional rumano que después de ejecutar a Ceaucescu se instaló en el poder a modo de partido único; al Partido Socialista Búlgaro... Curiosamente entre los partidos herederos del "socialismo real" el que conserva mayor preocupación social, con todos sus errores imperialistas en política exterior, es el único que no ha rehusado llamarse comunista: el Partido Comunista Ruso, de Ziuganov. <br>  El principio trotskista de la "revolución permanente", como fermento crítico para una renovación constante y de replanteamiento de las políticas, no se ha dado en ningún país, lo que ha provocado que tras la llegada de los revolucionarios al poder pronto se han alejado de la revolución y han tratado de anquilosarse en el poder sin más, respondiendo a la idea del escritor francés Louis Latzarus de que "toda revolución la inician los idealistas y la termina un tirano". <br>  El hacer una revisión continúa de la revolución facilitaría incrementar el nivel de democracia. Porque el socialismo democrático no sólo es posible sino que es necesario si se quiere obedecer al principio supremo del socialismo: el poder popular. Los comités de expertos que velan por los intereses del pueblo no tienen cabida en un verdadero socialismo. Para que el pueblo ejerza el poder tiene que valer su opinión y esto no se puede hacer sin democracia. <br>  Por último, considero que la izquierda tiene que repensar. Rectificar es de sabios. Pero este repensar habría sido necesario aunque no se hubiese caído el muro de Berlín. Es más, en ese caso la izquierda democrática (y no capitalista) tendría que haber estado más pesimista ya que hubiésemos seguido contemplando como la única alternativa de izquierda anticapitalista era dictatorial e impopular (Hungría en 1956, Checoslovaquia en 1968, Tiananmem en 1989,...). La alternativa socialdemócrata no sirve para quienes creen en el socialismo democrático. Al no cambiar el sistema, se mantiene el capitalismo, y en la época de pensamiento único que vivimos esto supone aceptar el neoliberalismo aunque se le intente decorar con cierto estado de bienestar que cada vez, por cierto, está en mayor peligro. <br>  Repensar la izquerda significa estudiar y buscar nuevas fórmulas que superen al capitalismo(33). Hasta el momento, en esta búsqueda los nuevos movimientos sociales (NMS) les están llevando la delantera a los partidos de la izquierda tradicional. Quizá porque ese tradicionalismo les sujete demasiado al pasado y les impida aceptar nuevas fórmulas que no hayan dicho antes los grandes pensadores de la izquierda anticapitalista. Los NMS cuentan con la ventaja de no venerar a ningún político, pensador, filósofo o cualquier clase de líder; de tomar conocimientos no sólo de la cultura europea; y de que, con su mayor democracia interna, están más expuestos a un debate desde dentro y con otros agentes sociales. Ahora Los Verdes franceses y alemanes nos irán mostrando si estos NMS también saben colaborar en un gobierno.|`|O6kTzhpfaa	Hola.<br>  El socialismo puede ser muy democrático, participativo, plural  e incluyente, sólo hay que tomar en cuenta la justicia Social no permitir que ninguna clase social, o grupo de individuos  tengan interés contrarios a la nación, ya que el ser humano tiende a beneficiarse y lucrarse por encima en prejuicio del colectivo, hay es cuando hay que entender que primero esta la patria y el crecimiento de una nación porque así todos podremos beneficiarnos.<br>  Saludos<br>  Gustavo|`|Yielt8yOaa	Socialismo cuando son personas socialistas de verdad los que llevan un pais o gobierno (no personas como Tony Blair)|`|b86c357e6249a153a8dd59e4e62da1aaaa	SIGO CREYENDO EN TU LIBERTAD A OPINAR , A CREER EN ALGO, EN ESTE CASO EL SOCIALISMO, PERO EL TREN DE LA HISTORíA TE ESTA GANANDO .

XeF4PO6baa	What qualifies as a "good job" varies widely on the individual questioned.  If Barack Obama gets his socialized health care program, there are some who will laud it as one of the greatest accomplishments of government in decades and others who will lament it as another slide into the nanny state.  If he spends his way out of this recession and somehow manages to balance the budget at the same time, some will praise him for his vision and others will criticize him for having spent all the money in the first place when the market would've corrected itself more quickly if he'd just left well enough alone.  I'm sure that no matter what happens, some people will love him, some people will hate him, and most people will find some things they liked about him and some they didn't.  It's hardly an objective qualification.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	listen to me seriously i am a republican and did not vote for him<br>  but if he does good things and makes the u.s. a better country i will vote for him in the next election<br>  i want the best for my country<br>  but time will tell what he does to the u.s. <br>  will you admit it if he fails ?|`|Rb5rW8nvaa	when  he doesn't have a successful presidency' will supporters admit he did a bad job, or will you continue to walk around looking like you have been sucking on a lemon all day?|`|fsGfQALoaa	I wish they would admit he was doing well, but they'll still have excuses.<br>  We'll see how it turns out...

A story could be made up, a fable, a "dramatization," or someone's interpretation of events. I realize that this may seem like hair-splitting, but you must recognize that Jindal is a lawyer. And lawyers think that they can avoid telling a lie by using carefully chosen words.<br>  <br>  True, Jindal wanted to give viewers/listeners the impression that he was actually in the Sheriff's office and helped that Sheriff to make a decision, when he was neither at the location nor involved at all in the decision-- which was made long before Jindal even heard about the Sheriff's description of what happened. But Jindal did not actually lie. He merely shaded the truth with the smoke and mirrors of lawyerly language.<br>  <br>  So gather round folks, while I tell you story.............|`|UgnvC05jaa	Ramsey how fast do you think it would take for Jindal to get a affidavit<br>  from the Sheriff, Quicker than you can count to ten. Nice try,|`|iehpzIQBaa	Did the south paw lose a little credibility<br>  <br>   LOL|`|AA11702773	Why do you think many of us care?  He MAY end up being important to us, they are certainly trying to sell him to us, but he may not.<br>  <br>  That having been said, and my personal view beginning to be that he is a neocon, aside, what he said is no worse than snipers in Bosnia and is much LESS bad than promising to fillibuster FISA if it contained retroactive telecom immunity, then voting for it, as Hillary and Obama did, respectively.<br>  <br>  Mind you, Ron Paul wouldn't have done it.....|`|AA10789965	a republican admitting wrong...are you kidding..they never do anything wrong..that is why they can criticize and be openly mean spirited...|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Christ!!!!!  the BO cabinet has more freaking lies going on than Bobby Jindals one lie so why *pounce* on this one guy? I am Republican and I am NOT ignoring this but I sure as hell won't be a freaking hypocrite and pretend that the dems are *lily white*.|`|JKbvnwcDaa	I think it is just that we don't care that he lied. How many times are you going to post this, by the way?<br>  <br>  <br>  @ Centered: Obama is our PRESIDENT, who is Jindal? Do you really want to compare the two?|`|AEtGbSs6aa	The only blind sheep are you Hussein followers|`|AA11993638	UPDATE: I'd initially misunderstood Sellers to be saying Jindal and Lee didn't meet while rescue efforts were still underway. In fact, she said, the conversation took place in the aftermath of the storm, but after the boat incident. <br>  "Bobby and I walked into harry lee's office - he's yelling on the phone about a decision he's already made," Jindal chief of staff Timmy Teepell recalled. "He's saying this is a decision I made, and if you don't like it you can come and arrest me."<br>  <br>  Teepell said the exchange took place in the week following Katrina, when Jindal visited Jefferson Parish multiple times.<br>  <br>  "He was boots on the ground all the time," he said.<br>  <br>  <br>  So according to the author's actual update from the link you posted, the incident took place within the week following Katrina, which was when the flooding was still affecting those displaced by the storm. So what is your complaint? It sounds as if there is at least one other person who states this happened as Jindal claimed, which in rescue terms Katrina was not just the day or two of the storm but a period of time that was weeks after the actual storm and levee breach.
Un3YxFvRaa	Every dollar redirected toward the government  "stimulus" plan and omnibus plan is taken away from private investment and spending, which is the major driver of our economy, isn't it? If we don't gather this money through taxes, our only other option is to create "play money" that weakens our currency to the point that lenders will look elsewhere for investments.<br>  <br>  The government does not "earn" any money.|`|HkwVevGcaa	Those making over 250,000 will pay and there will be additional tax revenue collected from the stimulus package, also the war in Iraq is winding down so that will stop a lot of spending.  That's where the money is coming from is it enough we shall see|`|1qFSaIz7aa	Taxpayers.  <br>  <br>  Who's money did Bush needlessly spent in Iraq?

It is our kids money that the government is spending.  I wish they would stop it!|`|58607c6ba5c8f548e69203c94d723527aa	Its sad isnt it. The only solutions our leader can come up with is put the burden on future unborn children. What happened to our country?|`|i0vcEyJtaa	It's money that is created out of thin air from the Federal Reserve, the private bank that controls the money supply. We also borrow most of the money from China. Yes, China is rich, considering they are our biggest importer, they already wanting to dump the US dollar because it is really worthless. When Congress borrows, spends, and orders the Fed to print money.... they are only mounting up debt that your great grandchildren will have to pay off. Considering the currency is not backed by anything but debt, with inflation sky high, it gives them the incentive to spend, and borrow when ever, where ever they want. The people elected them, of course. Sadly, a lot of them are re-elected because they don't represent actual change, or uphold the US Constitution as they swore to do.|`|fb0OkczJaa	The money belongs to everyone that pays taxes and that includes generations to come. As far as who voted for them, it's usually people who are ill informed and easily swayed by their rhetoric. It's either that or something in the water in D.C. because they all seem to forget about their constituents once elected|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	A big problem I have with this stupidy is they keep talking about the money coming from our children, our children's children, they break it down into how much it would be if each household in America had to pay up...... ENOUGH.<br>  The government and its pathetic and selfish representatives ( in name only) have done this all by themselves. They took the money from social security, they borrowed against the future or from anywhere they could steal it from and spend it like drunk sailors.......(appoligies to drunk sailors everywhere) for not even drunken military people would be so bold, stupid and have such a lacking plan to pay it back as your typical Washingtonian politician.<br>  I don't owe the government Jack.....there's alot of you out there in the same boat. We worked, we paid our dues, our fee's and our taxes. We did what he had to. We didn't get private jet rides to exclusive resorts, or pampering, we didn't get kick backs by special interest groups, we didn't get the higher pay, we didn't get prestige, we got left a bill, a rather large bill from an ungrateful and un American group of people whom love to call themselves representatives...when most don't represent anything but themselves and their own self interest of wanting to be a career politician. They run up the bill and try to make the American citizen pay the piper.<br>  Its time to reduce the size of government and give the power back to the people.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	Your grandkids will pay for this.

mm5p5sy6aa	Alright buddy, I understand that smoking weed happens. ****, half the people bagging on you have done it and have no room to speak.<br>  <br>  Look, odds are you'll fail the test if you take it tomorrow. You have a couple of options<br>  <br>  1.Just risk it and go to MEPS tomorrow<br>  2.Tell your recruiter that you'd like to reschedule for personal reasons (Recreational Drug Use is a big problem for recruiters and odds are you aren't the first one to be in this situation under their care.)<br>  3.Drink as much as you can stomach, take ex-lax, whatever you can think of to get your system a-goin' and take the chance.<br>  <br>  Personally, if I were you I'd tell your recruiter you'd like to reschedule, he might get mad but who cares, this is your career we're talking about and you should take that **** seriously, man.<br>  <br>  Thumbs down? Wow, you're cool. I'm the only one trying to put a positive light on this and ya'll are just tearing this guys 1 bad decision apart, grow up. Mistakes happen, if you really are having a hard time quitting you should seek help and get that **** straightened out. Weed really causes more problems than it 'helps'. I know this guy who smoked Salvia the night before he went to the hotel and he passed, it doesn't show up in the MEPS urinalysis.|`|HLf1QYd1aa	WHY would you smoke weed before joining the military? And no, you won't pass the test genius.|`|6PhSENcXaa	I'm with shilo9i.  Military is not for people who do illegal drugs of any kind.|`|tDZMJue9aa	yes they watch you closely, and no you wont pass|`|WdN3m1tEaa	No, you will not.

Joining the military means Surprise Piss Tests, the ENTIRE time you are in.  And yes, they watch you.  So unless you being high for a few hours is worth you being paranoid and anxious because you never know if the next time you go into work is the time you'll be piss tested, I'd recommend you grow up real fast and knock it off.|`|NL2tkQvGaa	Yes they will supervise and you will not pass! which is a good thing idiot! you are an irresponsible moron! why would you smoke weed????<br>  idiot<br>  oh and dude who said they would hold it for you, hold what?|`|kZ5NSg2Baa	Umm...yes they do supervise you.  At my MEPS we had to do it while in a t-shirt and boxers too. Do us a favor and just don't join. You are obviously an idiot for smoking weed right before a piss test.|`|6PBGAp7Raa	why in god's name would you smoke weed when you know that you have a drug test. we don't need people like you in our military.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	No, you will not pass.

Was it worth it?|`|YYAmBsvXaa	dude it wont matter if you smoke on the way there. if you tell them that you have smoke in the past few days you will be fine. dont worry just tell them about, it's there job to make sure your good to go in the military.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	Yes, yes they do watch you. And sometimes, if you're really good, they'll hold it for you. Most of the time they don't care how big or small you are, either, so don't fret.<br>  <br>  Any more than three shakes...|`|ohafdshKaa	Your screwed.

AA10780838	There is nothing that requires creditors to report debtors to credit reporting agencies.  Creditors use CRAs because that's how the credit system works.

Ut2MoCNLaa	A lot of "Special Forces" were used in the "Phoenix Program" of assassinating local tax collectors and village heads who were NLF (National Liberation front of Southern Vietnam, which is the correct term for what is frequently, and inaccurately called the Viet Cong. The term "Viet Cong" is  shortened slang for the Vietnamese Communists. Less than 4% of the NLF were actually members of the Vietnamese Communist Party and very few of them even knew or understood the theories of Marx, Engels and Lenin.)<br>  <br>  As the previous answerer said, the Special Forces were also used in intelligence gathering in medium length patrols of 4-8 days.<br>  <br>  Yes, the US Special Forces were feared by the NLF but they had rare conflict with PAV (Peoples Army of Vietnam which is the correct term for what is often, and completely inaccurately called the North Vietnamese Army).<br>  <br>  Both the NLF and the PAV really feared the Australian SAS who went on patrols for 6 weeks gathering information and calling in air strikes.|`|vOB8mJTgaa	Special Forces were also known as Long Range Reconnaissance Patrols, or LRPS, during the Vietnam war.  They would generally insert via helicopter behind enemy lines in 4 to 6 man patrols.  The patrols would generally last 3 to 7 days. Their primary mission was to gather information and pass it on their chain of command.  Sometimes they would go on snatch and grab missions getting enemy prisoners of war.  Sometimes they would take opportunities to call in artillery strikes against the Viet Cong.  As to weather or not they were feard by the Viet Cong goes, they were one of the most successful types of units in a war that had massive failures due to politics.  If you are interested I would suggest books by Gary Linderer, who is a LRP who served in Vietnam.  In his first book he tells his own story of Vietnam.  In his three successive books he tells stories of different missions gone good and bad.

Ask lots of questions.  Start off by asking for the person's first and last name.  Make them spell it out; make them spell out anything they tell you.  Ask them who took the subscription order.  What is that person's name.  Spell it out for me.  What period is the bill for?  How many papers were you supposed to have received.  Ask for the address to send payment to (even though I don't think you should pay anything).  Spell the street name, spell the town, spell the state, what is the zip code?  What is a phone number you can be reached at?  What is the address listed for subscription order? Get them to spell the street name, spell the town, spell the state, and what is the zip code?  Think up as many questions as you possibly can about any pertinent information; so many questions until they hang up on you.  If your story is true, don't pay for it.|`|XdGjhbfMaa	Whether or not they have the right to charge the bill totally depends on if you sister did in fact subscribe to it.  Keep in mind she may have done it inadvertently.  For example, when you sign up for a points card with a store, they often offer promotional subscriptions for a limited time and if the user doesn't call to cancel before that time is up, it continues into a paid subscription.<br>  <br>  You need to give them your sister's contact information so that she can sort this out.  For one, the collections department doesn't care what you have to say unless you're telling them you're giving them a payment.  Not to mention they shouldn't be talking about this matter at all with you beyond questions like "Is [person] there?" "Where can I reach her" "Giver her this number and tell her to call us back".  Secondly they can tell your sister how this "subscription" came about and she can better figure on how it's impossible since she knows everything she's done in the past few months.|`|r1II4dURaa	You should do any or all of the following:<br>  --call the department in charge of subscription billing and explain the situation to them.  Make sure you ask to speak to the department manager/supervisor.  Get the name of every person you speak with and write it down.<br>  <br>  --if you meet resistance, inform them that you are going to report them to the Better Business Bureau.  Make sure to document the date and time of your conversation(s).<br>  <br>  --the BBB can give you better advice in handling this situation.  <br>  <br>  --this last one is a little extreme--tell them next time they call that you have explained this situation, explain the situation again, then tell them if they call again that you plan to file harassment charges against the newspaper.

XeF4PO6baa	Look up "Compact Theory" on Wikipedia and it'll answer this question and many related ones.  Essentially, sovereignty is the right to self determination.  The 13 original colonies declared sovereignty from Great Britain with the Declaration of Independence, stating that the colonies were now their own independent states.  The 11 southern states that seceded from the Union prior to and at the beginning of Abraham Lincoln's term did the same thing.  Prior to the drafting of the Constitution, each of the states was in principle its own nation, and were united by the Articles of Confederation only as means of providing for mutual defense and for adjudicating trade disputes.  When the loosely assembled states were unable to put down Shay's Rebellion in 1786, they decided to craft a "more perfect union" and came up with the Constitution, which spelled out the role of a federal government, which included provisions for an army, federal responsibility for relations with other nations, as well as the roles of the previous Continental Congress and a few other things.  The 9th and 10th amendments to the Constitution dictate that the federal governments powers are derived from the people and the states and not the other way around, and that other than the duties specifically enumerated in the Constitution the federal government has no other authority.  Some states have drafted legislation declaring sovereignty in recent years as a response to what many perceive as the federal government overstepping its boundaries.|`|o1PuFnWmaa	The 10th amendment says "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."<br>  In recent years especially, and more importantly, in the recent few weeks, the 10th amendment has been getting violated more and more by the federal government who has been attempting to usurp state rights.<br>  <br>  The states that are passing declarations of State Sovereignty are saying basically that they've had enough and are done with the federal government doing so.|`|hkluRzcKaa	Believe there are now more than 20 states looking at similar legislation.  About time more people realize that the Federal should not have so much power over our lives.  I have a post regarding this issue at <a href="http://www.theartdeptchronicles.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.theartdeptchronicles.blogspot...</a> in case anyone cares to read.

It went on for 5 min. before a 12yr old boy road by on his bike, and went to get a cop.  The cop berated the crowd for doing nothing.  So unfortunately I guess it is not illegal to walk away from a crime and not tell someone. I can only pray to God that I do something if I saw a crime.  You do not have to stop it if you are afraid, but to do nothing is morally wrong.  Why people do not think at the time, that what if their mom, wife, sister, brother was attacked would they not want someone to help them?  I know I would.  However, if a cop asked the friend if he know about the girl that was killed, and he said no, then he would be considered equally guilty.  It is called accessory after the fact, or with holding evidence to a crime.|`|sdXzS7rpaa	It depends on what position you hold in a community. <br>  <br>  In your scenario, not legally, but it would be a very good thing to do, esp because of the circumstances.

What goes around, comes around.|`|R0f8q3D1aa	I would think that, though it might not be illegal not to report it, it could come back to bite you if you wind up being implicated in it?|`|Thd7Vczfaa	no.  I never report crime.|`|8xMhLMoRaa	This is a bit of a legal grey area. If you don't report it, especially if you know the criminal, it could be termed that you were an accessory after the fact, or that you withheld evidence. This can be difficult to prove though. If you walk down the street and see a robbery taking place, morally you should report it, but legally you wouldn't be in trouble if you didn't.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I'm not a lawyer but I think you bear no legal responsibility.. only the moral one. Now if you witnessed a crime but don't feel like telling... keep an eye on the news. you never know if they offer a BIG $$$ monetary reward for any info, that's easy cash! ;)

He complained about how the executives of banks used the bail out money to pad their lifestyle.  Well part of the problem is that he shoved the bail out legislations as quickly as he could.|`|AU70o6wTaa	I agree with him 100%. that stimulus bill only had '4' copies for the entire house to share with less than 20 hrs before the the vote and you know that nobody read it all. not possible.|`|AA11361876	what a great question, DAR!  i did not know that ron paul introduced this bill, the Sunlight Rule.  it sounds as though legislators should have TIME to READ a bill when they are not tired from the day or drunk from their social cocktail hour at the club before they vote on it!  i also did not know that the stimulus package bill was presented to the legislators in its final written form (1,000 pages, at that!) the night before their vote!  now, tell me everyone, how are we, the people, to be represented fairly and well by those that we have given office to by our votes if they do not have their heads on straight when they vote on a bill that supposedly will serve our best interests?  <br>  <br>  everyone, even the president, has to sleep, mind you.  even i have to sleep.  even i am tired after i work for 8 or more hours.  and if a drank alcohol as most legislators do (which is why cigarette taxes are way, way higher than are liquor taxes), i sure would not be in a condition whereby i'd absorb enough of the mumble jumble in a bill that is 1,000 pages long so i could reasonably vote yae or nay to it the next day!  the nerve!  <br>  <br>  a similar thing happened, DAR, you remember, don't you, with the bill that teddy kennedy and john mccain co authored for the illegal aliens' to be granted their amnesty (yes, i said amnesty) bill.  they just wanted it pushed through the vote without even OUR knowledge of what this bill said, and we bombed OUR representatives with telegraphs, emails, calls, and letters before they could pull that wool over OUR eyes, but, that bill in a different form is still awaiting a final vote (so don't forget that, everyone).  <br>  <br>  oh, and don't forget this one either:  there had been a bill presented to make it law that the legislators READ every word of every bill that is presented in congress so that they know what they are voting on, which is supposed to be what WE tell them to vote on, true or not true?  isn't this a republic?  isn't it our right to tell them, since we allowed them to represent US, what we want them to vote yae or nay on?  i have not been able to find material on the net that can show me whether or not it is now LAW that the representatives literally READ bills that they will vote on before they vote on them!  if you know, please post where.  <br>  <br>  we ARE the government.  we ARE the congress, but congress sure don't act like we are.  <br>  <br>  i do not get how all those folks could understand all that was written in that bill to be signed into law by the president, i.e., the stimulus package, overnight, do you?  (see "my questions" of today on my profile for a laugh).  <br>  <br>  yes, the Sunlight Rule should be made law before anymore bills are up for a vote.  <br>  <br>  not only that, we, the people of our republic, should have equal time to study every single bit of that bill with all its tag-alongs and side agreements and amendments to it before our congressmen are allowed to place their votes on it, in fact, we should have it available to us first, for ten days before the legislators get to read it for its own ten days, so that we are able to call, write to, email, and send telegraphs to our representatives on what we think of a bill, telling them how we want them to vote, since that is what this country is all about, which is why it is the best country on the planet.  <br>  <br>  why did obama state that he plans to bring in a national guard to rule over the citizens of our land, on our land?  is it because so many laws are voted into effect without our knowledge of them, therefore, that we haven't had a chance to oppose them to our representatives so that our representatives will not vote "yae" to them?  is it because he fears riots in the streets as a result of our annoyance over the fact that so often, bills are made into law without we, the people, having full knowledge of what they are and what they say and what bearing they will have on our daily lives?  i think so.  <br>  <br>  i hope the censure can also be one whereby we, the people, can drag criminal representatives out of their cushy leather chairs that we paid for to bring them outdoors to pilgrim-type wooden stocks so that we can place their heads and hands in them, lock them in, and then pass down buckets of ice cold water, one to the other of us, buckets marked "possession of of we, the people," to splash over their swollen and/or sleeping heads until they know that they had better wake up and do what we want them to do!|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	hey funny how this was one of OBamas promises. He said he would leave a bill out for 5 days, along with no earmarks, etc. <br>  <br>  Shame hes such a liar.|`|PgFYPZg2aa	The problem with the idea is that not much will get done, because more people will be aware of the stupid add-ons that get on each bill, and we would only get the occasional well written bill passed, oh wait I think that's how it is supposed to work, but don't tell politicians that, because they like to believe they are fooling us.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	Absolutely - with all this  disgusting adulation and empty rhetoric, it is at least comforting to know that there is one person in Washington who makes sense, and is actually looking out for the people.<br>  <br>  It may be David vs. Golliath, but I have to applaud his efforts to bring some sanity to Washington.  Even if members of Congress continued to vote along party lines, at least there is time to weed out the hidden agendas and pork.|`|yGXKYptjaa	Actualy what else is there to do and this kind of stuff going on in todays world.

How ironic.|`|caefe9fcecf0459fc50d20cbc39f206faa	Oh, Yeah!<br>  <br>  In addition to granting the bare-minimum amount of time needed to read the bill, each member of both Houses should be at least minimally drilled as to his/her *understanding* of it (i.e. they should pass a test proving that they know what they're about to land on our heads).<br>  <br>  The censure aspect reminds me of an idea I heard concerning a Constitutional amendment granting Citizens the power of veto over any item of any bill. Perhaps with the Sunlight Rule and no more than 40 thousand constituents per Representative, we wouldn't need that amendment. (30k is better than 40k. see: <br>  <a href="http://www.thirty-thousand.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thirty-thousand.org/</a><br>  ... very potent stuff! )<br>  <br>  ...

6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	Obama and Clinton lied to win the vote.  They like every other American realize that the war in Afghanistan and Iraq are necessary wars.

I worked just as hard as any of them and harder than many. <br>  You are a racist pig to insinuate that Americans do not work hard and I hope you go home when you loose your job. I welcome others to come to this country legally and enjoy learning about their cultures and languages while living and working with them. Criminals with no respect for the borders and laws of my nation and racist can go home. Self deport and save decent hardworking Americans the bus fare|`|30c80fd1b17a3706bf5570a2557e2287aa	Well that is your theory and you are free to have it but you are not right. The recession has been caused by 30 plus years of deregulation and outsourcing. However illegal immigrants have been a burden to the US and I applaud any town that takes the initiative to round up these illegal drains on our economy and send them back home.|`|qWNcOhJJaa	UM, wouldn't the deepest recession be a ........DEPRESSION?  We aren't actually in one of those, so take your tired arguements somewhere else you clown|`|NeBI2l1taa	if they are such hard workers why are their own countries third world|`|AA10482044	No, symptomatic, the depressions of the 1870's and 1930's were still (so far) at this point much deeper and far reaching than the result of our current infinite credit extension collapse.  Hitler was the greatest ever exponent of blaming all on foreigners etc, Germany lost all its best scientists inc Einstein and the fathers of the A bomb by pursuing their fascist populist idiot's policies, not to mention the V2 scientists who eventually got the US to the moon before the Ruskies, so bang goes that theory aye!|`|l5cxmTb9aa	Actually there have been no mass deportations and most of the illegals who left have done so after the downturn in the economy made it hard for them to make a living here.<br>  This puts a rather large hole in your theory.
tvNkizDraa	I suppose #2 would come the closest.  I don't ask many questions, but when I do they are meant to focus on a particular issue that (hopefully) transcends political party lines.|`|ly4INzzTaa	I have only one goal, to preserve the Constitution and the rights afforded by it. The Federal Government is supposed to handle Foreign Affairs and provide a check to the states ensuring that none of them can usurp their governmental authority. In turn the states are responsible for local decisions within their borders providing the same checks on the Fed. If  Fed dominance continues to erode the states rights we will eventually lose our freedom. If you like the way congress beat the daylights out of the bankers and auto makers wait until the governors take this money. Next year it will be their Cajones in a vice.|`|AU70o6wTaa	I belong to no party so I tend to ask questions more to make ppl think for themselves rather than along party lines. mostly trying to get ppl to know what's going on so that if someone has an answer it will come out. I know I don't have all the answers and like to here different views to get a better understanding of how ppl think.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	I sometimes ask questions that are real.<br>  <br>  I sometimes like to start debate.<br>  <br>  I sometimes like to start trouble.<br>  <br>  I also sometimes design questions to trap people into admitting their own hypocrisy.   <br>  <br>  Sometimes I end up admitting my own.|`|N1gd7juqaa	I refuse to be a part of the 2 party BRAND??  !|`|V92zPFXtaa	I tend to ask my own opijions and do not really take one side or the other I am more independant and try to look for candidates that are not too extreme with most things.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	I'm an independent (registered Decline to State) and don't follow along any party lines. I suppose I would consider myself a fiscal conservative and social liberal. But, I really look at the positions offered by politicians or the issues themselves, not whether they are espoused or presented by a particular political party.<br>  <br>  For example, I voted for a democratic president, congresswoman, and representative, but I voted for a republican mayor and governor. Not because they were democrats or republicans. Rather that they seemed to me to be the best candidates for the positions.
2rcSILkWaa	Oh, ye of little faith, let me count the ways.<br>  <br>  Balanced budget by 2012<br>  Eliminate $1 Trillion in budget waste.<br>  Allow pay of college education for public service<br>  <br>  Those off the top of my head.  Yours is still stuck up somewhere.  That might be why you could think of anything.|`|xJmDP5NGaa	NOTHING.....NOTHING at ALL|`|LNOsY8Jiaa	Obama never says anything of substance, he talks to hear himself.

He is going to stimulate you. He is not using protection because he will distribute the pill and you will take it when and how he tells you to. Kool Aid is also on the menu. You will be in labor for at least 4 years and no child will be left behind. Or, ummmm, that is except for the ones that are not perfect. We will throw them in a closet. No abortions are allowed after stimulation is preformed unless we deem it responsible and just according to our plan. We will provide health care for all those which feel sick after being stimulated. All those found to be infected and or any persons attempting to perform their own abortion outside the new and improved health care plan after stimulation, will be quarantined in an American facility with all the killer terrorist. For your safety, no sugar products or smoking will be allowed. We will improve your education and  teach you our way is a better way. Everyone will graduate a Professional Stimulator with honors.|`|jwTVz0q2aa	Nothing.  Everything he says is nice and prepackaged.

Though he affects it...he doesn't hold the key. However, he does need to take responsibility for every order and bill he passed into law. I'm growing tired of his "inheritance" speech. He had a chance to do something to make it better, and despite the outcry from the American public not to mortgage us for three generations, he still did it and pats himself on the back.|`|SIKuOevVaa	When it becomes his responsibility.  For the moment, the economy is still feeling the effect of eight years of moronomics.  Neither the stimulus package (just passed) nor Obama's first budget (only even proposed today) has had a chance to take effect.  This is still the Dubya economy, and his alone.|`|diDNl3BFaa	Any clue how the market works?<br>  Its not Obama's fault if it goes down, and perhaps you had your head in the sand, but the the market started plummetting under our last President.|`|HgKlFEpBaa	Obama is a liberal right?<br>  <br>  <br>  Therefore never.  Being a liberal means never having to say you are wrong or you made a mistake.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Never , he's a liberal they dont believe in personal responsibility ,its always someone else's fault .|`|8EbJJ0zZaa	When it's his fault.....the market drops 100 points if someone farts too loud.....and is not a realistic measure of anything....too many unrelated things effect it.|`|2bx5l56caa	Heres a test question. Did this crisis happen after his inauguration or before? think for once|`|6d6cbb5a2b06e880fd999f1286785016aa	I know, as a human you meant to say how long will it take Obama to reverse the trend. We have been in a down trend since September.<br>  <br>  This answer has to do with fixing the banks, witch were acting only in there own interests for a few years.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	The last market close of the Bush presidency was Friday Jan 16 (Jan 19 was a market holiday)<br>  <br>  Since that day until last Monday's close , the Dow Jones average has dropped 16 percent, all on Barry's watch.|`|oblTk6Sfaa	To be fair, the market has been on a steady decline since before he became president.<br>  <br>  The market problems are cyclical, and we should avoid trying to make it political by blaming it on either party.|`|Fy54FMemaa	When will the banks start taking responsibility for not selfishly indulging their executives in lavish gifts and bonus's?|`|f624b66aaed0290aaf76eedf3378ad4caa	LOL...<br>  LOL...<br>  LOL...<br>  <br>  ...a liberal "taking responsibility"...LOL<br>  <br>  STOP IT!!...You're killing me!!<br>  <br>  Thanks for the belly laugh.|`|PHU0lOl3aa	Obama will never take responsibility for anything negative that happens; he will blame everything on Bush.|`|1bf575e711cf9403c3bc6e5e84673885aa	Perhaps the day Bush and the rest of the Republicans take responsibility for anything, instead of always blaming the Democrats.<br>  <br>  <br>  That means you!|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Uhm...not sure if you have your eyes open but the market is coming back (my stocks are actually up right now)...so, can Obama take the credit for the 220+ pop yesterday?  (You obviously know little about the markets.)|`|TgUj8tV9aa	He tried to be optimistic so the market wouldn't free fall again, but investors don't like his ideas of bigger govt and more spending.|`|mBZU9a1Baa	He will never, ever accept...or allow his Democrat cronies...to accept blame for anything. It's the Liberal way, and he's The Messiah!|`|ss0vy4tFaa	hold your breath longer, we're in for a long ride.<br>  <br>  don't count on obama to get us out of this mess, because he's not going to.|`|4pHTkTUaaa	He will let you know as soon as he can somehow blame it on Bush.  As will the Obama supporters on here.|`|ffRTnoEyaa	When have any Democrats ever taken responsibility?|`|jxtzccasaa	Being a typically liberal elitist - the 12th day of Never.|`|3490bfd259ea171d15bc375ab4617cf0aa	HAHA<br>   <br>  WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THE LAST 7 YEARS??|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Never.  In their 1st year, all Presidents blame the problems on whoever just left.  It's called Politics for a reason!  :-(|`|M3maZgdyaa	They sent him a letter<br>  <br>  Dear Mr. President,<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, it’s true. The stock market doesn’t like you. <br>  <br>  Only one month in and investors are giving up. Another 30% haircut would put the Dow at 5000.<br>  <br>  <br>  And that level wouldn’t just put a crimp into your presidency. The ensuing collapse in savings and the U.S. pension system would destroy it. <br>  <br>  Now, some advisers may tell you not to worry about the stock market. That it will take care of itself. But that’s wrong. Especially today.<br>  <br>  At its core, the market is a measure of belief — the belief that investors can make money by buying a slice of America.<br>  <br>  And a plummeting Dow means they really don’t believe in the country. Or in you.  <br>  <br>  You need to turn this around and fast. Here’s some advice:<br>  <br>  1. Channel Ronald Reagan, not Jimmy Carter<br>   <br>  Everybody knows the economy is lousy. Everybody gets your “underpromise, overdeliver” routine.<br>  <br>  But if the economy doesn’t come around in a year, you’re still “wearing it” as they say on Wall Street.<br>  <br>  You’re the #1 salesman of America’s hopes and dreams. Quit moaning and go out and sell some optimism.  <br>  <br>  2. Enough already with class warfare<br>  <br>  Make no mistake. All that populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric in Washington scares the heck out of investors. <br>  <br>  What good comes from your Press Secretary attacking CNBC’s Rick Santelli? It makes the White House look weak and out of touch with the markets.<br>  <br>  Maybe you are. How else could you have signed Senator Christopher Dodd’s executive pay amendment into law? <br>  <br>  Forget that the amendment is poorly drafted, vindictive public policy. It serves nobody’s interests but the politicians who sponsored it.<br>  <br>  Dennis K. Berman<br>  <br>  <br>  Tell Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and your own staff to turn down the volume on the “outrage of the people.”  The election is long over.<br>  <br>  3. Rule out bank nationalization — even if you haven’t completely ruled it out <br>  <br>  Tell your Treasury Secretary to immediately announce that the nationalization of Citi and Bank of America is off the table.<br>  <br>  With their shares worth so little and the government already backstopping them, this is largely a matter of semantics.<br>  <br>  If you have to revisit “full nationalization” over the next couple of months, so what?<br>  <br>  Secretary Geithner can say the situation has changed. And it will have. The situation changes every day.<br>  <br>  4.  Make peace with Wall Street<br>  <br>  Go to New York, press the flesh and put some confidence into the markets simply by showing up.<br>  Meet with the same eight bank CEOs that were bashed two weeks ago by Rep. Barney Frank and his House Committee. <br>  <br>  Scold them for the cameras and then declare that a healthy America needs a healthy Wall Street. <br>  <br>  Announce on the NYSE floor that the SEC is re-instating the “uptick rule” as a way to protect small “Main Street” investors.<br>  <br>  Wall Street will give you a hero’s welcome.<br>  <br>  5. Shelve liberal, Democrat pet bills<br>  <br>  Why are your fellow Democrats so keen to frighten US industry?  Are US companies not terrified enough nowadays?<br>  <br>  Show that you want American business to win. Put the kibosh on Henry Waxman’s efforts to undo the Supreme Courts’ limitations on suing medical device makers. <br>  <br>  And while you’re at it, call for an indefinite postponement of the Employee Free Choice Act, the anti-business union card check bill. That one’s a real stock market no-no.<br>  <br>  6. Get the bipartisanship thing going<br>  <br>  It made investors nervous that Senator Judd Gregg ditched you and that you could only come up with 3 Republican votes on the stimulus.  Let’s get that bipartisan thing going.<br>  <br>  Join with the Republicans and put GM into bankruptcy. That’s the endgame anyway. Might as well co-opt the Republicans and give yourself some political cover.<br>  <br>  Of course, none of these measures is a guarantee that the stock market will go up. And certainly, many in your party will cry Judas.<br>  <br>  But you urgently need to do something to shift investor sentiment. Dow 5000 is in nobody’s interest. Especially not yours<br>  <br>  <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/mean-street-obamas-dow-5000/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/02/23/me...</a>|`|htSZsds7aa	why should Obama take responsibility for the stock market going down?

They are manipulating the market now just like they did over the past 10 years...just watch and see how they will make money again.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	i asked about this last night.how low will it go.i think they are playing limbo.this guy opens his mouth,it tanks.this is the democrats fault.who would invest if they are going to smack your profit with ever higher taxes.|`|i5F2jwvhaa	Expecting a democrat to show responsibility is like expecting a hooker to display morals<br>  <br>  I love how democrats say " the president has no effect on the stock market"<br>  <br>  Funny, they didnt think that when Bush was in office|`|rxScdXM4aa	how can he? he was just elected
27sSI5wxaa	Bobby Jindal is a lying and selfish politician who is only looking out for himself.<br>  <br>  His answer last night was to further his own political agenda.  I kept trying to figure out what he was rambling about.<br>  <br>  And he's taking $4 billion of the Stimulus Package, yet, he's acting like he's not taking any of the money.  <br>  <br>  The only money he's not taking is that amount that will help the unemployed in his state.<br>  <br>  Now how smart and logical is that?<br>  <br>  No way would I ever want him to represent me and this nation.|`|lr74sHPLaa	must be the intelligence intimidating you LOL|`|AA11702773	I don't like Michael Steele, I consider him a RINO neocon.<br>  <br>  I only suspect Jindal might be a big spending Republican (empire style) by the people who support him.

I need to look into him before 2012, though, in case Ron Paul doesn't run|`|BRyRtQSvaa	Me, I'm not impressed, he's ok but I'm not impressed!|`|q4EXFhV7aa	I was hopeful, until last night....I think his rebuttal could and should have been better.|`|um87XJvmaa	Yes, but you are not allowed to say it. You will be called a RINO.|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Yeah. I agree.<br>  I like him though.|`|8rvXwx7Qaa	Jindal is popular to many for his down to Earthness. He is a smart man with Rhodes Scholar credentials, but doesn't perspire eliteness. He has done much to eliminate the corrupt Louisiana political machine,so he is honest. He has been a Congressman, and he is a popular Gov. I don't consider him top of my list, I am looking at Romney.|`|b85499a57edbf5a1f37bce5ce90c8557aa	I thought it ironic how he went on the national TV circuit trashing Obama's stimulus package but he is perfectly happy to accept his cut - 3.8 billion dollars on behalf of his state. <br>  <br>  Actually all the republican governors are doing that - so maybe it's not fair to single him out.. It's just that he's been getting the most publicity in the process.|`|oMOiAFRBaa	I have to agree with Kathy.  Bobby Jindal has handled both his govenorship and national disasters like a champ.

The former would be less disturbing.
T3Tpgz5Vaa	I think our best bet Huckabe/Keyes, Steele would work too.<br>  <br>  I like Romney best though, he didn't seem to be very popular with the rest.<br>  <br>  Depending how much popularity Jindal can carry at the end of Obama's presidency, he could make a good vp, as we do have 3 years to investigate the guy.|`|Ow3iwCJlaa	I like Huckabee alot I liked him a lot before but he needs to be a bit more conservative economically like a Romney - and I dont think Romney can hold to be honest <br>  <br>  but Keys, Steele, Palin and Jhindal all have a shot too <br>  <br>  any combination of these would be a good ticked and I think Jindal did a good job, I dont htink he tanked at all I think the media is railing him unjustly and that Jindal did right talking so simple, think of his target audiance and how enept they are|`|2CxfFENRaa	I think Huckabbee/Steele would be great, but I'd prefer Romney/Steele.

People are always telling us how smart he is.  So why doesn't he understand simple economics?  Again, it appears he has other priorities.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	Pot luck<br>  .<br>  And Obama is full of Luck too<br>  .<br>  He is weeding out the crooks in Washington<br>  .<br>  And when he speaks Wall street listens to what kind of nuts they are <br>  .<br>  When they continue to lay off people <br>  .<br>  And Obama hints at <br>  .<br>  Don't   wall Street CEO's know that when you lay people off they don't shop or eat our any more|`|b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	It's all purely coincidental.|`|i2QYcHucaa	Investors are mostly republican congressmen|`|XxSj6AsBaa	It is easy to tell when he is lying.  His lips are moving.|`|AA10742996	Because those that understand economics realize what he is talking about will cripple the economy.

d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Absolutely, but it is their standard operating procedure. Democrats win elections by creating victims and villains. In Republican administrations Democrats constantly state that we are in a recession. They were stating this almost from the beginning of the Bush Presidency even though there was no evidence to support the contention. Their claims would be pretty useless were it not for the media constantly reinforcing and presenting these statements as actual fact rather than providing adequate analysis. The danger in this combination is that if you state something like this often enough and people begin to believe it then it ultimately becomes a self fulfilling prophesy as people lose faith and stop spending. Recession then becomes a reality as market capital dries up. <br>  <br>  However there are deeper forces at work which aided the Democrats. These being the pressures applied to make funds available to unqualified applicants and the resistance to proper oversight or investigation of the entities charged with implementing the process. In short, the Democrats fear mongered the recession and refused to allow proper investigation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The funniest thing yet is that they are now demanding a return to business as usual in these lending practices using the exact same failed entities and standards. Can you say vicious circle? <br>  <br>  The Republicans must bear responsibility for this also. Their response was to deny any problems in the economy which helped defer the crises for a time, but really refused to push for the oversight and investigation which was required. This was a hallmark of the Bush administration  though. Any policy proposal which was challenged to harshly outside of Homeland Security and the War effort was immediately scrapped as being dead on arrival.|`|cZypvAK8aa	Your link didn't work.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	no, they are just trying to clear up BUSH'S MESSES of 8 years!!|`|oMOiAFRBaa	The Housing / Banking crisis was actually very easy to spot for folks who are financially literate.  The only problem is that it was not able to really come to fruition until the masses learned exactly why interest-only subprime mortgages could spell doom for an economy built on the wealth associated with the debt if housing prices ever went down.<br>  <br>  Not surprisingly, someone leaked this information into the financial community and eventually the country at large and that is exactly what happened.  Those mortgages and associated securities were always worthless, the only differences is that nobody knew about it.  Investor confidence is tied directly to how much the investing public knows and once that cat was out of the bag, the economy took a nose dive.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think you may be right.  After all, it was democrats Barney Frank, Chris Dodd, and the folks at ACORN who were directly responsible for causing the current crisis - the Republicans are only guilty of sitting on their hands and keeping their mouths shut while the Democrats were setting up the American people, and in Bush's case, for taking advantage of the crisis with his bailout proposal.|`|1NO10YfPaa	The Republicans have had the power during these last thirty years.

TJpQZju2aa	It would seem you're pretty close, but the story confuses me a bit.  I live in Illinois, and low-income families fill out an income form at the beginning of the school year, and if you make less than around $25,000 a year, the kids get free lunches anyway.  You can get reduced lunch fees for annual income anywhere under about $45,000.  It seems to me that the cheese sandwich lunch shouldn't even be an issue, full price lunches here are $1.90 a day.  If you make over $40,000 a year and can't afford less than 2 bucks a day to feed your kids, something is wrong.<br>  Just my opinion though|`|9qKAy0dlaa	Republicans will punish a child to save a buck, that's the difference.|`|01zxefjnaa	Hey , feed the kids man. and keep giving them the free cell phones so they can talk between bites.|`|QJmc9jQpaa	my school had food from gov't while growing up that is standard cereal milk juice bread  like the wic program i'm didn't starve. and some days we got food from there catering my school also a wedding hall at night|`|lEaT5q06aa	add please<br>  <br>  republicans think that school should teach the kids how to think, and how to learn, and let the kids go find success if they want it<br>  <br>  democrats think that school should teach the kids how to fit into their place in society, and guarantee a place in society, and that place will be mediocre for all but the "exceptional" children|`|tDZMJue9aa	yes democrats think everyone who says i dont have should get it for free, never mind they are out shopping for shoes on the weekends at the mall..its not about priorities its about what i can get for free in life

If you ask a pot user "what good is marijuana?" you'll get some pretty cool but misleading answers (medical marijuana, hemp rope, etc...), but none of them come close to justifying rape, terrorism, murder and exploitation. I'm not saying that marijuana smokers are evil, but most if not all of them are unaware or uniformed about the infrastructure they are supporting. This isn't demonization, it's simply stating the ugly truth.<br>  <br>  Smoke a joint, support misery, torture, death and other inhuman crimes.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is also linked to schizophrenia and a rather virluent form of testicular cancer.  The Guardian -- a British newspaper has recanted on it's quest to legalize marijuana in Britain as it has increased the number of pot using mental patients over the last 10 years by double.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your fix.  There's a hefty price to pay.

Next thing we will see is another terrorist attack here on our soil being funded with that money.<br>  Does Obama really think that this money is going to buy him favor in their eyes?<br>  I'll tell you one thing Obama doesn't want, nor do the American People. And that is to make Israel mad at us. They have already told us to stay out of their business. We do not want to make Israel mad by giving Hamas this money, and then eventually sever ties with us. A war with Israel is one we would never win.|`|EdnQBmxZaa	The printing press is running non-stop.  If we are in such an economic "crisis", why not give that money to our own people rather than to a nation run by terrorists?  Since the nation is broke, are we borrowing this money from China too?  I guess Obama is hoping he can buy off Hamas like some political ally.  I'm sure they are laughing as they assure him that they will not use the money to blow Israel and us off the face of the earth.  I guess that is one way to eliminate the astronomical debt he is running up.|`|7HdgMaOnaa	not at all it should be up to the people of america not the people that think they know how to run it.

They do not create goods or services desired by private industry, and Japanese 'stimulus' packages, like our most recent HR1 are created primarily to provide jobs and funding for government workers and contract labor.

j8wZwC5raa	?Afectar?, para nada, eso es una visión empresarial y si, afecta. <br>  En mi particular no estoy defendiendo empresa, negocio o sindicato. Los que tienen empleos de empresas que pagan al tesoro y no ven retribuídas sus acciones pues si lo tienen mal, porque se genera una recontraoferta, las empresas de seguros siguen pagándoles para mantener cierto orden en las cosas que se establecen, pero siempre hay una vuelta de tuerca en la oferta y la demanda en el mundo del mercado, y cuando se quiere cegar al comprador presentándole una única oferta ¨oficial¨; siempre que esté en el mercado, ?cuando no?, la persona siempre tiene la opción de buscar una mejor oferta adecuada a su presente de ideal de intercambio; ésta puede ser considerada por los medios que mueven a los gremios como una actitud mala, como en efecto hacen en una actitud que puede ser generalizada por común; es cuando los medios están de diablillos o que la están pasando muy ¨canutas¨ o perdieron a imaginación. <br>  <br>  Si consideramos que no hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver puede considerarse, entre la gente, el ambiente de economía sumergida; la opción para controlar y participar serían los diferentes precios y el respeto empresarial, entonces por mucha mala bola que exista siempre que participe de forma activa o pasiva (con dinero, acciones o actuaciones) siempre se respirará una atmósfera; pero cuando por hacer, comprar o decir o actuar ya estás proscrito, pues la atmósfera quiere ser parcializada o llevar por determinado cause la vida comercial, de intercambio o de acciones, siempre puede hacer lo que le de la gana, de ahí que surjan desconocidos, ?porque le da la gana!.<br>  <br>  El problema fundamental es cuando hacen lo que no saben hacer, pasar de aprendices a operarios.

He did not promise to end the War on Terror,.  On the contrary, he campaigned on INCREASING our involvement in Afghanistan.  Also attacking Al Qaeda in Pakistan if the government there will not act.  We knew this.  Your point is ill-informed.|`|peEHzKGDaa	To get bin Laden... something BUsh promised to do.|`|jwTVz0q2aa	He is a Zionist stooge.  Look at his Jewish cabinet.|`|mkEGjlmNaa	How dare you question the divine will of Glorious Leader Comrade Obama.|`|AA11209233	You thought wrong.  He promised to ramp it up.  Were you listening?<br>  <br>  He promised to get us out of Iraq, and that he would pursue the terrorists who attacked us wherever they are.  And that's what he is doing.  Ending US involvement in Afghanistan was never a promise of Obama's--it was something conservatives totally made up during the election to make him appear unwilling to act for our nation's security.<br>  <br>  Good thing the republicans didn't win.  Bin Laden would die of old age before they captured him--since they think working with or against Pakistan on this issue is unrealistic and naive.  We need someone tough on national security.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	This question makes ZERO sense. Putting more troops in there to help makes it safer for the troops already there. I guess you haven't studied anything regarding the military whatsoever. Escalating? It isn't escalating it's called fighting a war. That's how you do it.<br>  He did promise to end the war, in Iraq. And that's not right now, he needs way to much money for that (which he doesn't have). So he can't take the troops out of Iraq right now. Afghanistan is still going, if you don't know why then go and google "9/11" and see what comes up.<br>  <br>  EDIT: wayfaroutthere, if the reps had won it would make no difference to capturing/killing bin Laden. They aren't the ones going after him, some guys carrying guns who you and I don't know about are the ones going after him.

yYYXVCGZaa	you guys can do whatever the **** you want and have whomever the **** you want as your leader.  we here in the states simply despise any form of socialist/communist dictator, which is what chavez is, because that form of government is antithetical to the principles of freedom and liberty that this country was founded upon.  it's just that simple hector...|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	While some party members (which I assume you are) have done better in his system, the vast majority of your country is still doing very poorly.<br>  <br>  Also, he fancies himself "dictator" for life, by suspending elections.

3caq6SFxaa	Carrying or concealed carrying varies from state to state and all states require a permit to carry concealed and some states allow carrying open without a permit.  The open carry permit states are usually western states and rural areas where many people work and carry a weapon for protection against snakes and other pests plus to ensure the safety of stock from predators.  Other states require a permit either way as is required here.  I would guess from your second part you are young so probably do not qualify for a pistol carry permit or would be allowed too legally; to answer that yes fighting is usually a misdemeanor regardless of whether it is agreed to by both parties or not and regardless of the reason; excluding boxing, wrestling and so forth being put on as a licensed show.|`|sxXoLSPxaa	each State has its gun laws. fighting in public is a misdemeanor. local law prevails.|`|A3TbeH62aa	If you are a soldier, cop, FBI, CIA or Secret Service I suppose so -<br>  The question really should be Why do I need to carry a gun - we are not allowed to here in the UK - And what we here over here about your gun crime over there is so scary you should all ban guns offa that street at least.

M7oAG5Aiaa	I am not sure what it was that you were watching but what I saw was a complete joke. His use of the Katrina response as an example of how government has failed was the funniest line of his speech. Someone should have reminded him that it was his party's bungling of the hurricane relief, that he was attempting to link to why government doesn't work, that was beyond belief. It is true, government in the hands of republicans does not work!  If he was a Rhodes Scholar, that is something worth investigating.|`|44IT2kmNaa	LOL. Yeah Piyush did a great job making Obama look even better. It's reflected by the polls.|`|Am1wfhBDaa	OMG! Did you watch the same Debacle as the rest of the nation?

If you are going to follow a sitting president, you'd better find someone who can deliver your message effectively. Jindal has a bright future but his speech last night was not a shining moment for him or the republican party.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	Jindal will have to overcome his love of earmarks.<br>  <br>  In 2007, Jindal led the Louisiana delegation in Congressional earmark funding. According to Taxpayers for Common Sense, in 2007, Jindal's earmark funding was 14th among all Congressmen<br>  <br>  so his speech was hypocritical.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	You are kidding...the only thing missing from Jindahl's speech was "boys and girls" after each talking point and maybe a couple of Muppets.  The man speaks to Americans like we're 3rd graders...but that is probably the mentality of the Conservative base...go figure.|`|SSLekPAnaa	Although it was nice to see, it doesn't take a Stanford degree to shoot Obama's theories down.

30c80fd1b17a3706bf5570a2557e2287aa	I am not a Republican, however I am not an Obama fan. Why will his policies work? His stimulus package was loaded with pork. I don't see how his policies will logically work to turn this recession around. His speeches are nothing more than feel good fluff meant to placate an unintelligent citizenry who don't question things too deeply.|`|c6b7a10c63265cc871ef2c76bb9a82c4aa	Yeah. It was so good that the DOW is down 147 points.<br>  <br>  Rave that.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	less than 500 people answered the poll questions, I don't consider that an accurate view of the entire US's feelings on his speech.<br>  <br>  US population... just over 300 MILLION|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	No surprise. I already knew Obama gives a good speech. It is when he actually has to answer real questions sans teleprompter that the true measure of his ineptness is adequately displayed. You are welcome to believe whatever makes you feel comfortable regarding his plans and I will do the same. History will determine which of us was truly the more discerning observer. I am content to wait because I have seen the evidence of the failure of these types of plans played out repeatedly throughout history.|`|VOccyg7daa	Rave reviews from the media whores, there's a big shock. Did you find anything positive or uplifting in his speech? I know I sure didn't, just more doom and gloom and the evil rich and the evil banks.|`|My65doewaa	Dow: -2.0% Nasdaq: -1.7%<br>  <br>  Looks like the market liked his speech huh?  But, given the economic damage Obama has already done.. I wouldn't say his policies are working.|`|b32jC7pGaa	With each passing day, the Republican party becomes increasingly irrelevant and impotent. Jindal sounded like someone with a multiple personality last night. Repbulicans have LOST THEIR WAY!|`|5hxWSezPaa	Once again, you overstate your case.  His economic policies are a disaster.  The stimulus law is not going to produce any significant jobs and his idea of raising taxes in a recession failed miserably in the 1920's.  His entire economic policy is unsound.  But, people get fooled because he is a good speaker.  The proof will be in the pudding.|`|yViX0rLxaa	Independent..here--and I don't listen to obama's rhetoric--he has so far not said anything of substance--just keeps talking about talking--and keeps promising--tp keep promises--<br>  <br>  he's like watching Goofy in Mickey Mouse cartoon--multiple two numbers--and it takes an hour--uhmm..it is two times--uhmm..14..and let's be perfectly clear--that--um..now listen--equals--humm..well that equals--\== god--by then the TV is off and we're al asleep...<br>  <br>  Yes--obama is good sleeping medicine..|`|fiKneZ20aa	I'm Independent.

WOW|`|TSsmnZdkaa	By remembering "you can fool all the people some of the time, some of the people all of the time, but you can't fool all the people all of the time."<br>  <br>  Oh yes, we know what his policies are.  He will cut the deficit he just drove up by raising "only taxes on those evil rich people who create jobs and produce everything we want, need, and desire" but by doing so, they have to raise their prices to be able to pay the government more money, which means YOU pay more in the end.  Or lay more people off or go out of business cuz they can't afford Obama or you.  <br>  <br>  Can't wait for that kind of success.<br>  <br>  I bet you have an alter with his picture above it that you light candles to and pray at every night.|`|6xlKSCr6aa	Anybody can make a speech, I have been watching Obama for 2 years make speech's and dodge tough questions on how is economic plans actually work. The stimulus Bill is pork feed, the bank Bailouts ain't helping, and up until last night every speech Obama made was gloom and Doom, nice to see a change no pun on his own words but a different approach. Socialism doesn't work and it won't work here either, Rejoice, dance in the streets today if you want I am tired of speech's!!!!!!! I want action and results|`|b1b39b4b70b44020b5007791dfb52e8caa	I love the speech, sadly the naysayers still dont want Obama to succeed, the market is down.

I would have been more impressed if he hired some cheerleaders to deliver his "feel good speech". Would've beat looking at his smug smile and Pilosi jumping up and down.

I know they all claimed yesterday they don't want to run the banks, but I believe what they DO, not what they SAY.<br>  <br>  If they don't want to own/run the banks, then they need to stop taking stock in them.<br>  <br>  Study the history of socialism and socialist countries. You'll be surprised how similar what is happening here is to it.<br>  <br>  Also, make an internet friend in Canada and ask them how much of their paycheck is taken in taxes. Many things they want to put in place (national healthcare, more social programs) are similar to Canada's policies.  I worked for a company in Toronto called Swissmar. I was a rep for them in Ohio in the US, so my taxes were taken based on the US system. But my counterparts in Canada would lose about 60% of their checks to taxes and social programs!|`|WCkOUF9aaa	The government is on the hook for banks period.

They froze the credit line and credit is essential to a properly functioning economy, if money is not put into the system to cover the bad loans then the value of everyone's property and capital will plumit.  The banks are the basis for the economy. (this is why Obama is NOT a socalist, because he realizes that something must be done about the problem to save the free market.) <br>  <br>  After all this clears up  I think some trust busting is in order because you cannot allow these banks to have so much power.|`|tvNkizDraa	These bailouts set a dangerous precedent for rewarding bad business practices and serve as a set-up for future failure.  A few months ago we were told the financial institutions were "too big to fail"... then they used bailout funds and unapproved tax breaks (see Tax Code, Section 382) to make themselves even larger.  Here's an interesting article about 'moral hazard' as it applies to the business bailout culture:<br>  <a href="http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/moral-hazard/2008/09/19/what-moral-hazard?page=0,1" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebigmoney.com/articles/mora...</a><br>  <br>  Many blame the UAW for the problems in the auto industry.  I admit the wages and benefits are significantly higher than non-union wages, but I have a hard time placing the blame on people trying to make a solid middle class wage while the business practices of the auto giants go uncriticized.  For example, I dare anyone to watch "Who Killed the Electric Car?" and then justify a bailout for GM.<br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5871495968130273402" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/223/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/now/shows/223/</a>|`|ONjTdk7Kaa	Obama has bipartisan congressional approval.<br>  <br>  Bush authorized the auto-bailout over the protests of congress.|`|773a0ef61688dd825e941d816e68d310aa	He calls it "reparations".

En verdad la democracia se reconoce a una cosa: es el respeto total y absoluto del voto y de los derechos civicos de la minoria. Si la minoria no es respetada, si no puede expresarse libremente como lo hace la mayoria, entonces no hay democracia pero tirania de la mayoria, algo que no tiene nada que ver con la democracia. Las elecciones libres son una condicion esencial en la democracia pero jamas han sido la unica condicion para afirmar que un pais es democratico o no. Hitler llego al poder por las urnas pero no era una democracia porque no habia tolerancia ni libertad economica, de informacion y de expresion. Otro pais contemporaneo donde no hay democracia pero dictadura de la mayoria (otra forma de totalitarismo) es Cuba y Venezuela.|`|796493694e7c67f0c612c7e925c39304aa	Es el poder soberano del pueblo, de elegir a sus representantes.|`|1d5848fe2f9cd3c629072b5c4ff8d39eaa	Es algo muy lindo que no han aprendido los gobiernos de Argentina|`|77a47f3a97d1f73697512b80cebc1c08aa	Pues etimológicamente hablando significa gobierno del pueblo, proveniente del griego "demos" = pueblo, "kratos" = gobierno.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo actualmente se ha deformado mucho su significado.

Desconozco tu edad, pero me imagino que no será muy avanzada, cuando desconoces lo siguiente. El se?or Pedro J. fue un socialista de los pies a la cabeza, que apoyó al socialismo durante la transición, que colaboró en la guerra sucia del desprestigio que le hizo el PSOE al CDS , ayudando terriblemente al injusto desgaste del único partido de centro que existía en Espa?a, para aupar a Felipe González al poder, precisamente emplando el oder mediático de su periódico, que junto con El País (el Pravda espa?ol), realizó calumnia sobre calumnia hasta conseguir, junto con la guerra sin cuartel que plantearon los sindicatos con el desmoronamiento y posterior desaparición del centro político. Por culpa de ello, en Espa?a, la gente que trabajamos, que no llegamos a fin de mes a pesar de hechar muchas horas, que no tenemos un 4x4, ni un chalé con piscina (es divertido ver que ese estereotipo que la izquierda asigna a la derecha, suele corresponderse con muchísimos más izquierdistas que derechistas), tenemos encima que tragarnos la constante falta de programa electoral, a excepción del victimismo de una guerra perdida en el 39, el odio, la división, el veneno, el aumento de los precios, en la bajada del nivel de calidad de vida... Mientras, algunos están muy entretenidos con que si Bush esto, con que si Blair lo otro, con que si Aznar aquello. Son los recortables que os da ZP para que, como buenos izquierdistas, os ancléis en el pasado y no os deis cuenta de lo que sucede en el momento actual en Espa?a. La Iglesia es el opio del pueblo, dijo Marx. El socialismo es la heroína del pueblo. Pues el se?or Pedro J. continuó en esa actitud, hasta que un buen día, de golpe y porrazo (zas), empezó a despotricar contra el gobierno. Cuando vió el lodazal en que se había metido (Filesa, Ibercorp, GAL, dinastía Guerra, la cultura del pelotazo, etc), quiso bajarse de aquel tren que iba cuesta abajo y sin frenos. Por eso, los que le conocimos aquella época, le damos la credibilidad justa a ese se?or y su periódico, porque sabemos que quiere da?ar a los socialistas (algo le hicieron, su caso es muy similar al del superjuez Garzón, que tras salir de las listas electorales del PSOE de malas maneras, se puso a perseguir a cargos socialistas sin ton ni son), porque sabemos que conoce muchos datos y muchos trapos sucios del felipismo, porque estuvo en su nucleo, y sabemos que los odia. Sabemos que conoce datos que usa cuando le convienen, al igual que hizo con el CDS. Ja, ja, ja, conservador, cuando fue a la boda del príncipe acompa?ado de su esposa vestida de bandera de la república, por favor... Sabes que dicen que no hay peor antitabaquista que el ex-fumador?

If you live in the northeastern region the fastest way would to go to Montreal and head south and go through the border then end up in Vermont then make you way from there.

How would they know?<br>  Oh, they live there.<br>  <br>  Power within the government of the People's Republic of China is divided among three bodies: the Communist Party of China, the state, and the People's Liberation Army. This article is concerned with the formal structure of the state, its departments and their responsibilities. All positions of significant power in the state structure and in the army are occupied by members of the Communist Party of China which is controlled by the Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China, a group of 5 to 9 people, usually all men, who make all decisions of national significance. As the role of the Army is to enforce these decisions in times of crisis, support of the PLA is important.<br>  <br>  The primary organs of state power are the National People's Congress (NPC), the President, and the State Council. Members of the State Council include the Premier, a variable number of vice premiers (now four), five state councilors (protocol equal of vice premiers but with narrower portfolios), and 29 ministers and heads of State Council commissions. During the 1980s there was an attempt made to separate party and state functions, with the party deciding general policy and the state carrying it out. The attempt was abandoned in the 1990s with the result that the political leadership within the state are also the leaders of the party, thereby creating a single centralized focus of power.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_...</a><br>  <br>  I explained and provided a link for the ret@rd.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  China seeks 'powerful' response to crisis: state media<br>  16 hours ago<br>  <br>  BEIJING (AFP) — President Hu Jintao has warned of a deteriorating economic situation in China and called for more "powerful" measures to reverse the tide, state media said.<br>  <br>  "The world economic situation is austere and complicated, the global financial crisis had yet to level out and China's economic growth is under pressure of a slow-down," Hu said, according to a report by Xinhua news agency.<br>  <br>  In a speech to the ruling Communist Party's 25-member Politburo, Hu called for "more powerful and efficient measures to increase domestic demand, and consumer demand in particular," the report said late Tuesday.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g_FMkGlaU8U4KCIPMya8YZdLRBrA" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/art...</a>|`|AA11993638	China IS still a communist country although they tell every nation they are socialist with capitalistic leanings.

AA10087362	Let's see Bush inherited a recession and got slammed again with 911 yet this was his factual record.<br>  <br>  This is from the wall street journal Sept 8th 2008.<br>  <br>  PRESIDENT BUSH HAS A GOOD ECONOMIC RECORD<br>  The evidence shows that much of the Democratic Party's criticism of President Bush's economic record is wide of the mark, says Keith Marsden, a fellow of the Centre for Policy Studies.<br>  <br>  How does the performance of the U.S. economy really compare with other advanced economies over the eight years of George Bush's presidency? Data published by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, the International Comparison Program (ICP) (a cooperative venture coordinated by the World Bank) and the U.S. Census Bureau allow a nonpartisan, factual assessment, says Marsden. <br>  <br>  Economic growth:<br>  <br>  U.S. output has expanded faster than in most advanced economies since 2000. <br>  The IMF reports that real U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) grew at an average annual rate of 2.2 percent over the period 2001-2008 (including its forecast for the current year). <br>  President Bush will leave his successor an economy 19 percent larger than the one he inherited from President Clinton. <br>  This U.S. expansion compares with 14 percent by France, 13 percent by Japan and just 8 percent by Italy and Germany over the same period.<br>  The latest ICP findings, published by the World Bank in its World Development Indicators 2008, also show that GDP per capita in the United States reached $41,813 (in purchasing power parity dollars) in 2005; this was a third higher than the United Kingdom's, 37 percent above Germany's and 38 percent more than Japan's.<br>  Household consumption:<br>  <br>  The ICP study found that the average per-capita consumption of the U.S. population (citizens and illegal immigrants combined) was second only to Luxembourg's, out of 146 countries covered in 2005. <br>  The U.S. average was $32,045; this was well above the levels in the UK ($25,155), Canada ($23,526), France ($23,027) and Germany ($21,742). China stood at $1,751.<br>  Source: Keith Marsden, "Bush Has a Good Economic Record," Wall Street Journal, September 3, 2008.<br>  <br>  START BLASTING AWAY|`|5934b4ac2c8b2f469b3de84858dc0d56aa	The economy is driven by investor decisions.<br>  Investors - people who lend money or make decisions that are reflected in the stock market - make those decisions based on what WILL happen in the FUTURE as best they can predict it.<br>  They are essentially putting their OWN money and future and the destiny of millions of people directly on the line.<br>  Politicians are NOT betting their OWN money.<br>  Do you see the difference?<br>  <br>  Since it became evident that Obama would get the Democratic nomination ( May 6,2008) and now, the Stock Market has FALLEN by 6000 points.<br>  Why?<br>  Because Obama pledged on the campaign trail to do exactly the WRONG things to make the economy function efficiently and well.<br>  That is EXACTLY what he is doing.<br>  That's why the market CONTINUES to DROP.<br>  <br>  The investors and American business in general KNEW that the proposals made by Obama would CAUSE unemployment and a POOR economy.<br>  They STOPPED investing.<br>  They sold their stock and got liquid.<br>  They canceled plans to expand businesses.<br>  They let workers go so they didn't get stuck with high payrolls or new government mandates.<br>  <br>  Tens of millions of retirees and those nearing retirement have seen their entire LIFE's savings and pensions DISAPPEAR because of Obama.<br>  Is he at fault?<br>  DAMNED RIGHT.<br>  <br>  Who else do we blame?<br>  The Democratic Congress.<br>  Their tax-and-spend policies have done the same thing to the business climate in America.<br>  They are killing the economy.<br>  Pure and simple.<br>  <br>  WHEN?<br>  November, 2006 - Congress.<br>  May, 2008 - Barack Obama<br>  <br>  The END of the American Dream|`|mMFJrPbvaa	Every President has inherited something from the previous administration, get over it.

Si el vendió la camioneta con tu autorización verbal, más no tenía nada escrito es decir un poder DE COMPRA-VENTA firmado por ti.<br>  <br>  Te aconsejo que soluciones eso, no solamente que te entregue el dinero sino también que busque a la persona a quien se la vendió, ya que legalmente esa camioneta sigue a tu nombre y si la persona que la tenga comete más delitos, no solo lo del cinturón de seguridad sino otros delitos más graves, tu serás la perjudicada.<br>  <br>  Pienso que tienes que obligarlo a solucionar este problema legalmente, que le traspase los documentos de tu camioneta firmados por una notaria y por tí como due?a de la misma al COMPRADOR,  y así te evitarás más problemas.

Remember to keep your body straight and your head up (a common mistake ppl make is to drop their head).  If you arms give out do them at an incline, lean against a desk or counter with your body at a 45 degree angle and do them that way with your arms at about sholder width apart.|`|vwOcFXgcaa	Its actually NOT called a "fat Farm" its called an "FTU" Fitness training unit. They PT the snot out of you, and (in 1995) you needed to do 20 push ups to get out of there and on to training. I knew a kid that spent six months in one. (no, not me I was there a week and was like "F--- this!")<br>     Anyway, I have soldiers NOW who have never passed a PT test and I know a fellow NCO who hasn't passed a PT test in THREE years.

In a business sense, it makes no sense to pay a person 15/hr when a person overseas(with a crazy accent ,who you cant understand sometimes) can get payed 5/hr and do the same job. It makes no sense at all. To be honest I don't really see many companies returning to offer jobs here. Many of this billion dollar companies have got used to the amount of money they pay for labor. Take it they might have some pressure from the U.S. Government now with the whole recession and Obama trying to get the wheels movies. Realistically i just cannot see that. sorry|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Taxes and tax cuts are not going to do anything to bring jobs back.  What is going to do so is finding a way for the stuff to be produced cheaper in this country.  And you need to give companies incentives to keep the manufacturing in the US instead of venturing abroad to take advantage of "slave labor".  Also making benefits cheaper (one has to account for health insurance and stuff into the cost of employing individuals) would do a lot to keep companies hiring here in the US.<br>  <br>  It would also be beneficial to offer employees in the US that are the only ones that can successfully do the job.  Technical items that can be produced most efficiently in this nation would work great - but that would mean dumping money into the education system as well as offering incentives for individuals to work in those fields.  Money isn't the only motivator - studies have proven that.  People have to stop assuming that American workers are too expensive.  Respect, career advancement and stability go long ways in keeping employees.  You keep them happy, and they may want to work for you for a little less.<br>  <br>  But all this means completely restructuring the entire mentality of the corporations in this nation.|`|CBx6qHztaa	Lower taxes.|`|Yzb44aV6aa	You wont be able to bring back all overseas jobs and you shouldnt want to.

But when jobs were filled and people arrived in these cities and could not find jobs, they continued north into America to find a source of income.<br>  The reason why these cities became industrially strong, is it was cheap to do the labor there and cheaper to be that close to America, so transportation for the finished product wouldn't be as costly.<br>  <br>  Right-wingers got what they wanted, and like usual want to cry about the effect.|`|2a48fdc514a71a7ec08cb137b00a0443aa	Because the illegals are costing some much money, so the liberals raise the taxes on the rich to such a point, that it is cheaper to move the business out of the country then continue getting tax increases.|`|8OaAmwq8aa	sniffle..ok.|`|VOccyg7daa	Yeah, I see that happening.|`|piYGWTiMaa	When you say "whine," I'm assuming you are referring to Americans upset about Mexicans showing no respect for our immigration laws by entering the US illegally.

8xMhLMoRaa	Why don't you go to school? It won't matter if you leave school before the prosecution happens, they will still be charged with what you have done in the past. Go to school now, and your mum and dad can tell the court that your behaviour has improved. That way they might not be fined or jailed. They can and will prosecute for this. The ONLY way you can help your parents get out of this mess is by going to school like you should've been all alongl. Prosecutions can take anywhere between a few weeks and a few months, but regardless, it will not matter whether you have left school in the meantime. If you don't start going to school now, there is a very real possibility that your parents could end up in prison, and with a massive fine.|`|3caq6SFxaa	If you are so concerned about your parents then get up and go to school.  Not sure about the UK but in the US the parents are responsible for ensuring their children attend school.  In many states that means they can be charged, fined and even put in jail for not doing so.  Most cases prosecuted here that I know of are because the parents just don't want to bother the child or let them sleep in which is a decision by the legally responsible parent and the minor and like all decisions their are consequences.|`|AA10925759	If it makes it to a certain level they can actually come back up to a YEAR later.

It certainly would if you are to seek any grants, loans, future scholarships or anything of that nature. <br>  <br>  But it probably would not get that far in the end.

Then you're free to do as you wish.<br>  <br>  Edit: I don't know how long, but even if it takes more than the 6 weeks you have left, they will still be able to follow through as your parents didn't uphold the law.

And to a great extent, the changes that do occur end up reverting during the next pollitical cycle.<br>  <br>  Remember that no one is acting out of pure evil, they just want to assert control over the masses and subdue (or at times, incite) revolution among the people.
xw13XqNaaa	Yes.  It increases investment in the private sector.  There is a multiplier effect when money is invested regardless of where it is coming from.  Currently, the private sector is not investing money so that is why the government is kicking in.  That is why wars were in good in the past.  The Iraq war however is a White Elephant.|`|8QWr77YZaa	Actually government spending decreases the wealth of the nation.  As we are already 12 trillion dollars in debt, printing out more money to "save jobs and stimulate the economy" just isn't going to work, plain and simple.<br>  <br>  An even worse idea is Robin Hood.  Sure it may provide a temporary reliefe by taxing the crap out of rich people to get more money into the Gov't to pay for all these "programs".  There are so many tangents to go on at this point so I will try to be concise clear and narrow.<br>  <br>  From here you can say that with the Gov't in major control of the National Banks and making new ones at that (Bank of America) printing out money as fast as they can load the ink, having China heavily invest in our loans much like Fannie May and Freddie Mac.  Did they own the US?  Because they were doing exactly what China is doing, keeping the U.S. afloat.<br>  <br>  Ok, to the point.  If we tax the crap out of the "megarich" (nice quote there from guy above me)  Then why would anyone strive to make new companies, new businesses, etc.  Why, if I can work my way up making the same pay somewhere, would I have any incentive to bust my butt off to make my own company or product to make less then the people that work for me?<br>  <br>  From the dawn of our existence we have had differences in monetary gains in our society and cultural system.  The idea of what a currency is may have changed, but we are sitting here saying that we are so smart and we need to make everyone equal and tax the crap out of the rich to make them have the same salaries as joe shmoe.<br>  <br>  Joe Shmoe doesn't care to make anything with his life, he just wants to go to work and pay the bills on time.  This eliminates the possibilites for new inventions companies deregulation (this list can go on forever).  The point is, we need the super rich and the super poor, because without them there would be no middle class, there would be no super rich.  Lawlessness ensues.  Im not going into philosophy here, but the point is, IF YOU TAKE AWAY SOMEONES INCENTIVE TO STRIVE FOR EXCELLENCE, then they will stop striving.|`|AA11995384	Well when you consider it's our money they're spending, we're hardly going to be MORE wealthy!  I suppose, in reality there are situations  where this could be the case but they are very rare.  And of course there's always 'payback time' to put into the equation.|`|wqchA8B7aa	It doesn't increase it. It redistributes it. Now I believe that everyone should work for a living, so I don't think just taking the money and giving it out is a good idea. However, putting that money into projects so people work to make it is, however. For the past 50 years, the rich have been getting richer, and everyone else has been getting poorer. It's just how capitalism works. It's time to put the taxes on the mega rich, back.|`|Irjopfpvaa	Right now because of the severe economic recession, there are almost no spending activity, and credits are frozen. The government has to intervene, as was the case even during the Reagan administration (GOP still denies this), in order to "stimulate" the economy back. <br>  <br>  The problem with the GOP's trickle down economics is that it's trickling up not down. Sure the businesses that GOPs favored filthilly profitted. But are they contributing to the American economy? Will they hire Americans rather than outsource if the corporate taxes are lowered? Certainly they did not want to pay the taxes due even if they have shops in 3rd world countries that pay dirt cheap.<br>  <br>  To snowboard: Nope, taxing the megarich does not take away excellence. In fact, it goes to America so it can invests to provide better quality of life like early educations, universal health, better public infrastructures, modern public transportations, etc.<br>  <br>  The thing is you are talking like excellence comes from having corporations rake in profits and then they trickle it down to public. How, in the form of donations? Have you seen corporations suddenly wants to increase minimum wages so hardworking Americans'  quality of life can catch up with his grandparents' levels? Nope. Corporations wants profit, period. Their greed is naturally insatiable, and there are no reasons why they will voluntary contribute without taxes or regulations on outsourcing of jobs.

The phone charge could possibly be an "interrupting emergency communications" charge, if she was calling 911.  He can be eligible for bail once he's not intoxicated any more, and he will probably be fined and put on a domestic violence probation detail at the very most.  As for the information I am given here, he's looking at misdemeanor crimes.<br>  <br>  Edit: Also this is if he's even convicted.  Most domestic violence charges get dropped.<br>  Edit Again: Forgot about the interrupting emergency communications - possible felony charges can be filed, most likely will plea away.

b8uYVhVMaa	No it is not self defence. It is a grievous assault which would get anyone locked up.|`|Re9Pdfxbaa	It could be deemed that the mother was physically stronger and he had no other choice but to use the screwdriver in order to protect himslef from serious harm. The law states > "WHEN FORCE IS NECESSARY ONLY AS MUCH FORCE AS IS NECESSARY MAY BE USED" ><br>  This means; The minimum amount of force must be used. If someone is punching you and you punch back and knock them on the ground.... this is enough to stop the person from harming you because they are on the ground...but if you carry on and kick them while they are down you have used more force than is necessary so you will have committed an assault even though you wre punched first. If someone points a gun at you, even if not a real gun but you believe it to be a real gun, you can do anything at all to stop that person because it is reasonable for you to believe your life is in danger, therefore you can kick, stab, spit, pick up an iron bar and smash them on the head. But if you took the gun of them you can not shoot them because the threat to you has been removed. These ar examples to emphasise the situations you could be in and the legal means of response to protect your self. The law is formed around what "A REASONABLE PERSON WOULD DO".  In the case of the 14 year old the law would decide what is reasonable in his response to his mother. He may have been regularly bullied by her in which case the final assault by her could have pushed him over the top thereby he responded thro a temporary diminished responsability thus in law he would not be acting as "A REASONABLE PERSON" so he may not be responsible for his actions because his mind is diminished and use of the screwdriver is accepted. She may have continously hit him amd refusd to stop, use of the screwdriver can be permitted because he felt under serious threat of being seriousely hurt.|`|PfnvTFWvaa	No that is not self defiance, because the person went to for, once ans attacker is no longer a threat, and you keep attacking, then you ave just broken the law, this depends on how the laws are written in the area where the attack took place|`|BEqAhXBlaa	depends how badly the mum was beating him, if it was enough (and he has the marks to prove it) to claim self defence then he may get away with it<br>  <br>  Also needs to take into account when did he assault her, how close to him was the screwdriver etc etc|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	this would be a crime..so the criminal justice system.law enforcement would do their job in prosecuting this criminal act|`|SttRtZ1Kaa	Locking the jail door and throwing away the key (comes to mind).|`|sdXzS7rpaa	Well he's 14.. if you can prove a strong case, he could get off. <br>  <br>  Due to the severity, unless there's concrete proof he had reason to act out so strongly, he'll probably be facing some time. <br>  But the good thing is, he's only 14, so it won't be on his permanent record.

So yes, according to the CENSUS you would be considered rich with that income every year.  There are more homes in the U.S. that fall into the poverty level than the middle class and upper class combined.  As a whole the United States is not equal.  He is simply trying to close the gap.  I for one want everyone to have a chance at a better life.  Maybe you don't realize how fortunate you are because you've been there for so long.<br>  <br>  And yes some but not all the wealthy need to punished i.e., the oil tycoons who made billions off struggling families with $5/gallon gas.

The left always has an excuse for this happening, but if you look at the historical markets since Sept 08 you can definitely see what is happening.

Next time he shows up get a cell phone picture of him and if you can mail it to your district attorney. It is usually a he said, she said issue.

Most officers leave warrants like that alone if the offender minds his own business after the incident.  Just keep on your guard and don't hesitate to call 911 if he violates again.<br>  <br>  Also depending on your area, the police could be quite busy to pick someone up on a violation of No Contact warrant.
8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	I would contact you local police department, make a report and see what they tell you to do.

AA10023092	They are not unless...<br>  <br>  They are admitted to probate, which has to be done for them to be effective at all.  Anyone can go to the court house then and look at the will.<br>  <br>  One reason estate planning attorneys suggest to their clients that they might want to use a trust as an estate planning option is that a trust can remain private.  IN other words kid 1 does not get to know that kid 2 got more money them him. <br>  <br>  Some people have the common misconception that a will is magical and transfers property.  Really though wills only tell how the property should be transferred.  This is done in probate.  Until then the will means nothing.

d718e68db0e03feea7b7b84e8684264daa	The original intent was to keep government in the hands of the PEOPLE!<br>  <br>  a. A well regulated militia---The goal<br>  b. being necessary to the security of a free State,---The reason<br>  c. the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.---The means of accomplishing the goal.<br>  <br>  This is spelled out in a quote from one of the authors of the 2nd Amendment, Tench Coxe;<br>  <br>  "Whereas civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as military forces, which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow citizens, the people are confirmed by the article in their right to keep and bear their private arms."<br>  <br>  Some fools will claim that the Second <br>  Amendment means that the National Guard can be armed, those fools are WRONG!!  The National Guard is a select militia, like the Second Amendment was passed to defend against.<br>  <br>  "Congress may give us a select militia which will, in fact, be a standing army - or Congress, afraid of a general militia, may say there shall be no militia at all. When a select militia is formed, the people in general may be disarmed."<br>  <br>  -John Smilie<br>  <br>  Remember that Mao stated that political power comes from gun ownership, which is why the Government needed to impose gun control, so that the government would control the people and the people could not control the government.<br>  <br>  ALSO, the right to keep and bear arms is one of the defining rights of a free citizen, and the Constitution was amended to prevent that, and the other defining rights, from being taken away from a class of people.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	The president can't change the constitution.

But I can guarantee you that they were quite purposeful in their selection of words.<br>  By the way... "gun control" only 'controls' those who obey the law.

If you are able, speak to others that have been in relationships with her and find out if she's done this before. <br>  <br>  In cases like this, as the process goes along, the false witness (your ex in this case) will often do one of two things: Either they will screw up, and contradict themselves when they have to give details of the alleged abuse...Or, they will be overwhelmed with guilt and change their story. Hopefully one of these happens for you. If not, your attorney should be able to get her on the stand and show that she is either lying or not a reliable source (by having a history of lying or other things), and then, if there is no other evidence than her word, the case should go your way.

Hay conductas punibles de obra y omisión; en esta última podría tipicarse tu inactividad, porque en nuestro sistema de ley se establece el delito de "Instigación y ayuda al suicidio" (creo que así está), con cuya aplicación sí sería punible que tú no hicieras nada al respecto, en caso de que ella llegara a consumar lo manifestado, pero también aquí se debería probar que tú tenías conocimiento de su decisión y los motivos que tuviste para no actuar.<br>  Por otra parte, pudiera ser solo una forma de chantaje y para determinarlo sería bueno que analizaras los antecedentes de tu relación.<br>  Finalmente, sería bueno que consideraras: si ella se quiere suicidar por qué o para qué te involucra a tí?|`|5db01f8ea4253cd9a0c7d13bab09ac87aa	No habría complicidad, ya que el suicidio no es delito...

Personalmente creo que solo te está presionando, pero la realidad es que jamás podrás "estar" y mucho menos amar a alguien a la fuerza o por presión, y no se va a suicidar.<br>  Pero, si así lo hiciera, "es DECISIóN DE ELLA", no tuya. Si alguien es capaz de quitarse la vida por la falta de correspondencia de amor de otra persona, es que en realidad tenía otro tipo de problemas de personalidad, de los cuales no eres tú responsable, y seguramente se suicidará por tí o por alguien más, el problema real es ella.<br>  <br>  En resumen, no te preocupes, no lo va a hacer, pero avísale a su familia para que puedan ayudarla, eso me parece más importante.<br>  <br>  Suerte, y recuerda...tu no eres culpable de nada!|`|K0PyTCaEaa	Primero que nada, no creo que nadie se suicide por tì porque parece que estàs muy chavito.<br>  Segundo, tu novia debe ser una chavita fea y sin experiencia en el amor y es mentirosa porque ni siquiera se va a suicidar.<br>  Ustedes son para cual y por èso son NOVIOS y aùn creen en el amor de Romeo y Julieta.<br>  Un suicida no le dice a nadie que se va a suicidar...simplemente lo hace.<br>  No te preocupes.

Sus respuestas son irracionales y utiliza la fuerza, bien de palabras, de acciones o de hecho. Fijense como ha reaccionado con lo del REY de Espa?a.  Le pide una disculpa publica a cambio de no nacionalizar industrias espa?olas en el país. <br>  Con la derrota, lo dijo bien claro anoche, que el no haber logrado su objetivo, no indica, que los cambios en la constitución es materia olvidada.<br>  OJO. No podemos permitir que Chavez se salga con la suya. <br>  Tuve la oportunidad de ver su discurso de concesión, ante la derrota. Menosprecio y dijo que a el no le hubiese gustado ganar de forma pirrima. Que el no quiso angustiar al pueblo de Venezuela con esperas innecesarias, que aceptaba la derrota, por ahora. Todo esto, unido a las caras de pavor, de las personas que lo, acompanaban es el indicio que Chavez se esta quedando solo. Sus secuaces ya deben estar haciendo planes para dejar el país, mientras puedan. Ellos saben que el final de su movimiento esta cerca. Chavez también lo sabe y esto lo hace mas peligroso.

Las palabras del presidente chavez le desmontan por un lado el discurso a la oposicion sobre si es democrata o no? ahora creo que eso no es lo mas importante, mira yo vote por el Si y me sorprendieron los resultados pero eso no quiere decir que me sienta derrotado el margen fue muy estrecho y yo creo que debemos interpretar es a los abtencionistas. <br>  <br>  creo que fallamos en el PSUV como plataforma electoral, a nivel organizacional la oposicion si nos gano. La campa?a de los medios de comunicacion contra la reforma fue descarada y mentirosa y a decir verdad mucha gente se lo creyo. Por otro lado debemos tomar en cuenta que chavez sigue manteniendo su liderazgo pero la gente se abstuvo de votar para demostrar su descontento con las instituciones del estado, co?o no es posible que ministros, alcaldes gobernadores y cuanto ser buracrata haya en venezuela no haga su tarea. no es posible que ante el saboteo de los due?os de los medios de produccion, la corrupcion se este comiendo a mercal, no se le de seguimiento a  las obras, y la nueva burguesia bolivariana que juega a la desestabilizacion ante la posible profundizacion de la revolucion se siga enriqueciendo y manteniendo a la vieja oligarquia.<br>  <br>  Creo que eso es lo mas importante, La gente no dijo No al modelo socialista, La aoposicion no crecio significativamente,la gente que se abstuvo lo que esta pidiendo es Practicar la etica y la legalidad para poder construir un estado socialista. ojo eso si. aqui no hay pacto con la derecha, esos locos de la oposicion como los del comando de la resistencia si se vienen a querer sacar a Chavez por que ganaron una batalla estan bien pelaos.<br>  <br>  Al minimo intento de tumbar a nuestro presidente, democraticamente electo, el pueblo bolivariano saldra como el 13 de abril y esta vez si no perdonamos.<br>  <br>  de todas formas felicito a los del no porque reconocieron la constitucion bolivariana, espero que sea de verdad.|`|QoBoyfHaaa	LE IMPORTO UN BLEDO LA REFORMA??????????

bzaXBaffaa	Hola David.<br>  Veo que hoy te has levantado mas serio y sinceramente esto es lo que me gusta (mas que los chistes) que aparezca en la sección de política, no obstante siempre está bien preguntar y responder con un poco de buen humor.<br>  Hace 8 a?os estuve de vacaciones en Cuba, la cual me la habian vendido (como a la mayoria) como un parque temático de la revolución donde la gente si pasaba necesidades lo hacia con alegria y cuando llegué allí vi que en cierto modo era verdad, que la gente pasaba necesidades pero la alegria no la vi por ningún sitio.<br>  En otros viajes he convivido con personas que vivian humildemente pero en ningún otro lugar he sentido como en Cuba la impotencia de los que en realidad somos los privilegiados del primer mundo pero que topas con un monstruo que hace de barrera entre el granito de arena que tu quieras aportar y el destinatario real de esa ajuda, el pueblo. Y ese monstruo no es otro que el miedo que con el paso del tiempo a alienado a muchos cubanitos que creen que eso de Patria o muerte sirve para algo mas que para el beneficio de los despotas que gobiernan la isla.<br>  Me prometí que volveria a Cuba el dia que haya una verdadera democracia allí, el problema es que si esa democracia se basa en el odio de los cubanos en el exilio (como por desgracia te encuentras tu y muchos otros cubanos) hacia los que si creen (equivocadamente creo yo) en el actual desgobierno no se avanzará nada.<br>  Me gustaria que en otras preguntas opinión desarrollaras como creeis los exiliados que se debe hacer la transición hacia una cuba democrática.<br>  Y hay que hacerlo rapido que el robocop (es que es como el de la pelicula) con barba ese que come yogurts con Chavez tiene dos telediarios (es una expreisón espa?ola de cuando a algo le queda poco tiempo, el telediario es el noticiero)<br>  Quizás me he enrollado demasiado, pero ves que alguna vez podemos coincidir en alguna cosa <br>  <br>  Saludos...|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Asi es David y aún existen personas como el Peeperm que defienden a Castro y a Chavez, Presidentes que implementan el socialismo marxista leninista y es para degradar al pueblo.<br>  <br>  Solo hay que visitar a Cuba para ver la forma como viven, todo lo que les niegan y de lo cual tienen derecho, ni si quiera pueden opinar vivien como robots o sombies y es triste ver como las playas con prohibidas para ellos si son playas solo para los turistas, los hoteles, etc. y ni siquiera pueden entrar si tienen dolares ya que son CUBANOS y eso es como ser una peste para Fidel y su comitiva.<br>  <br>  Solo hay que vivir en el comunismo para saber cuanto se sufre, cuanto se discrimina, cuantas personas se matan por no estar con ese proceso malsano.<br>  <br>  Un abrazo para mis hermanos cubanos y que ojala pronto salgan de ese yugo que tienen hace 48 a?os....<br>  <br>  Y QUE VIVA LA LIBERTAD A NIVEL MUNDIAL.<br>  <br>  <br>  p.d. no solo tener una digna casa, celular, ropa, sino los principales articulos de primera necesidad como pasta dental, shampoo, jabon para ducharse y lavar, etc y sobre todo comida para alimentarse ES RARO QUE LLEGUEN A VER A UN CUBANO GORDO, ES QUE LOS QUE DEFIENDEN ESE PROCESO NO SE HAN FIJADO EN ESO???' porque no se van a vivir a cuba para que vean lo que es BUENO...Grrrrrrrrr<br>  <br>  Te escribo algo que lei de SIR WISTON CHURCHILL y que me hizo reflexionar:<br>  EL SOCIALISMO ES LA FILOSOFIA DEL FRACASO, EL CREDO DE LA IGNORANCIA, LA PRéDICA DE LA ENVIDIA Y SU VIRTUD INHERENTE ES LA DISTRIBUCIóN IGUALITARIA DE LA MISERIA.!!!!!<br>  <br>  P.D.

En los a?os 92-93 , recibi la visita en Cuba de tres amigos chilenos que residian en Alemania, tuve la oportunidad de vsistar con ellos varios lugares de la Habana Vieja, mientras paseaba con ellos por la zona del cine Payret, me detuvo la policia por espacio de 30 minutos , indagando cual era el motivo por el cual yo andaba con ellos, me inspeccionaron de arriba hasta abajo, me tiraron por la planta de radio para ver si habia cometido algun delito , es decir averiguando si tenia antecedentes penales. Al no detectar nada , me dejaron ir con un buenas tardes y perdone la molestia.<br>  Mas reciente y a raiz de la visita de un grupo misionero a la iglesia a la cual pertenecia en Cuba, estabamos haciendo un recorrido por las calles de la Habana Vieja, desde que entramos en la zona, senti que toda la policia estaba detras de mi, imaginarte un moreno andando con tantos rubios, riase el que quiera!!!!!, pero en Cuba es asi, cuando ven aun ***** con extranjeros al lado , todos los ojos van para arriba de uno, bueno al darme cuenta tuve que alertar a los misioneros pues estaban repartiendo caramelos a unos ni?os que se encontraban en el parque ubicado cerca de la calle Muralla, y tratando de evadirlos y tratando de verificar que verdaderamente me estaban siguiendo, hasta que me doy cuenta que me habian hecho un cerco para interrogarme. Cundo me detienen , me piden mi identificacion y me preguntan de donde soy y que hacia con los americanos aquellos , simplemte le respondo a lo que me contestan y me dicen , no te preocupes que esto solo es para que si a alguno de ellos le ocurre algo , ya nosotros sabemos donde localizarte.

Lo de Gorvachov fue una verdadera proeza.  <br>  Si Raul esta actuando de buena fe, tratando de remediar en algo las penurias de los cubanos por causa de su hermano y siempre apoyado por el mismo; entonces, como dices, será del principio del fin del sistema imperante en Cuba.  <br>  Tendria entonces que permitir a la Oposicion ENCARCELADA por sus ideas, salir de las carceles y hacer publica y sin persecuciones su politica, tendria que echar abajo LA CONSTITUCION SOCIALISTA, tendria que permitir que los cubanos viajaran libremente siempre y cuando obtengan visas de cualquier pais, sencillamente por placer, tendria que permitir la libertad de expresion y de prensa... etc., etc., etc., Y ESO, AMIGO, EL NO LO VA A HACER.....

Euvinia, ya ves, estamos coincidiendo.<br>  Para mi la razón no es solamente los cambios que Raúl Castro pueda introducir en Cuba, así como la apertura económica y política.  No se si el tendría la talla de Gorbachev para introducir en Cuba una verdadera "transparencia" y "reforma" como se hizo en la Unión Soviética, pero no dejo de creer que sea la "tablita de salvamento".<br>  Lo que más me preocupa en el cambio en Cuba, podría ser la violencia.  La venganza.  El odio.  El rencor. El "pasarle la cuenta" de unos a otros.  Recuerden que en Cuba, todo el mundo sabe disparar y que tanto de un bando como de otro, hay mucho resentimiento.  Un cambio violento en mi Cuba de hoy, no sería como el del 1o de enero de 1959, ?se recuerdan lo que pasó?  Esos primero días fueron violentos.  ?no se recuerdan como se fueron a buscar a los "chivatos" a sus casas?, los parquimetros, los casinos, los períódicos, (Diario de la Marina)???????. Yo tengo 63 a?os y me recuerdo perfectamente, porque todo me impactó aunque era un ni?o.  Hubo violencia y sin embargo, el pueblo no tenía los recursos de armamento que hoy existen en Cuba ni la organización del ejército como existe hoy.  No sé, eso me da muy mala espina y es por lo que más me preocupa un cambio brusco.<br>  Opto por la transición, si no es con Raúl, con cualquier otro pero reconozco que Raúl hoy sería el mejor parado.  NO ES LA SOLUCIóN, sino solo un paso de transición no violenta o quizás, la menos violenta posible. <br>  Los factores para que esto pase es que Raúl, al fin, ejerza su verdadero papel de presidente y con mucho respeto, aparte a su hermano de la barba de todo acceso de poder.  Quizás sería bueno que siga escribiendo sus editoriales en Granma, pero ya la gente no le haría caso al ver cosas positivas y palpables en los cambios que pudieran introducirse.<br>  Hay mucho miedo en los que mantienen, no los que tienen, sino los que mantienen el poder en Cuba, por que?, porque saben que siempre hay una justicia que juzga.  Por eso la línea dura se mantiene detrás de Fidel, por miedo a su cuello, sin embargo, una transición pacífica y paulatina daría un poco más de seguridad a esta gente, que por nada, quiere arriesgar su cuello. <br>  Siempre he estado por la paz, pero también por la justicia.  No tuve agallas para quedarme allí por miedo a la carcel así que tampoco puedo pedirle a nadie que arriesgue su vida porque yo lo piense.  Eso creo que tenemos que tenerlo claro todos los que nos fuimos.  Ser tolerantes con nuestros hermanos que sufren y sobre todo, ponernos en su lugar, allí en la Isla. <br>  Que Dios nos ayude a salir de esta, lo mejor y más saludablemente posible. <br>  Un abrazo a todos.|`|w5iuFB47aa	Raulsiempre a sido el peon de ajedres de fidel ,no creo que el dirija a Cuba,ya sabremos la respuesta unas jugadas mas adelante.|`|6lDKTZ2aaa	Es tiempo que desaparezcan los castros de la vida politica de Cuba porque ya se acostumbraron y cuando muera Raul que ya esta viejito querra dejarselo a otro y asi jamas volveremos a tener un gobierno que no sea puesto de dedos.

aYZataQbaa	Sí, hay muchos tipos de Socialismo, y creo que el más viable es el Socialismo Democrático. Y creo que es la forma perfecta de gobernar, en Espa?a gobierna un partido Socialdemocrata. <br>  <br>  La gente que te habla de Socialismo = Dictadura, son personas que "han oido..." o "les han dicho...", gente inculta que no se informa, solo despotrica contra lo que les han ense?ado que es "malo". Esos que les ense?án son los que después roban a su pueblo llamandose patriotas. <br>  <br>  Se basan en Lenin, en Mao, en Fidel, dictaduras.

Pero bueno, la pregunta de en que solo se basan en hechos hirtóricos tiene una implicación un poco más profunda e interestante. <br>  <br>   Como ustedes sabran, historicamente han existido sistemas politicos basados en el socialismo, en particular comunismo. Sin embargo, a consecuencia de que USA deseaba IMPONER su propio sistema politico-economico en el mundo (al igual que hoy en día quieren imponer sus principios 'democraticos' a fuerza en medio oriente) a mediados del siglo XX, lanzó una campa?a de desprestigio increíble en contra de cada uno de los países que tendían a ser socialistas. Todo esto por la idea de buscar el control del poder y no permitir que Rusia, China, Italia, etc. siguieran expandiendo esas ideas político-economicas. Desde entonces (entre 1940 a final de la Guerra fria), la postura de EUA era causarle un temor increíble a sus ciudadanos y al mundo entero, de que el socialismo-comunismo era como 'vivir en el infierno en la tierra'. <br>     Los ejemplos de Cuba es interesante, y veo que un participante lo menciona como un 'ejemplo de lo que no debería de ser'. Ese ejemplo es lo que USA siempre buscó. Sin embargo, USA nunca se?ala que éste hizo TODO lo posible para que Cuba no tuviera relaciones comerciales con NINGUN país del mundo!. Por lo que su economía estaría siempre destinada a tener poco. Sin embargo, me gustaría preguntarle a esta persona, ?Sabes que sistema economico-politico posee China?, ?Sabes al igual que es el pais que empieza a aportarle más a la economía mundial y que es muy probable que en pocos a?os todos los países dependan de él en terminos economicos?. Ahora, muchos paises europeos mantienen gobiernos de izquierda o laboristas (una izquierda que se identifica con ideas neo-socialistas), y para nada son un Venezuela!.

En Europa por lo menos seguro que no tendría éxito porque los pueblos no están tan necesitados y son mas cultos, en Argentina y Chile me parece que tampoco, simplemente porque en esos países latinoamericanos hay más desarrollo económico y un nivel cultural mas alto. <br>  <br>  De todos modos, tendemos a subestimar a perosnas como Chávez que parecen papagayos, sin cultura ni educación, sólo nos preocupamos cuando ocurre lo que está ocurriendo en Venezuela. Mucho ojo, aunque desde la perspectiva de personas con una cierta  formación pensamos que personajes tan patéticos y desquiciados no pueden triunfar en la política nos equivocamos. En países donde el 60% de la población vive bajo el umbral de la pobreza esto es muy probable, atentos a México, Perú, centroamérica (Nicaragua, Guatemala etc..). En estos países cualquier monigote que  prometa la salvación de la miseria, a un pueblo oprimido por unos pocos oligarcas es muy muy fácil convencerlo.<br>  <br>  La historia está llena de ejemplos, dictadores dementes que en un principio trajeron prosperidad a sus pueblos acabaron como acaban tarde o temprano todos los dictadores: Napoleón, los dictadores en Europa del este... esos iban de salvapatrias y mira como terminaron: tras arruinar a sus pueblos y vivir como auténticos emperadores (Napoleón llegó a hacerse coronar por el Papa), fueron derrocados por el mismo pueblo que un día es encumbró. ?Ocurrirá lo mismo con Chávez?|`|fTe4fMiAaa	nooooooooooo|`|e3e0859a6d940e18984562e8a315e526aa	pues yo creo que solo le creen en venezuela

Primero fuimos nosotros los que nos oponemos a él: nos empezaron llamando Puntofijistas, pasando por Oligarcas, Escuálidos, Golpistas, Fascistas y un sinfín de motes mas que ahora han decantado en Disociados y Ultraderechistas. Lo malo del caso es que no tienen ni la menor idea de qué significan cada una de esas cosas, solo saben que son un insulto y lo usan a destajo porque creen que tienen licencia para hacerlo, pero les pasa como a quien escupe hacia arriba que el escupitajo termina aterrizándoles en la cara, porque cuando tú ves la definición del insulto no hay nadie a quien se le pueda moldear sino a ellos mismos. <br>  <br>  Ahora se ha dedicado, de manera torpe y visceral a mi entender, a buscar enemigos en paises con los cuales nos unen vínculos de fraternidad que son infranqueables. Chávez siempre ha buscado enemigos para decirle a sus seguidores "la culpa de que no haya podido hacer nada no es mia sino de ellos". Siempre el culpable es otro, como si de verdad las responsabilidades fueran transferibles, puesto que cada quien es responsable de sus propios actos y obligaciones, nadie mas.<br>  <br>  No es un secreto que Chávez ve en su futuro inmediato una reacción internacional a sus constantes agresiones e intromisiones en las políticas interiores de otros paises ajenos al nuestro. Y él esta seguro de eso porque a diferencia de la Cuba de los 60s, detrás de Venezuela (y aquí pongo al país, porque quienes corren y correrán con las consecuencias de los desvaríos e irresponsabilidades de este se?or seremos TODOS los venezolanos, opositores, oficialistas y ni-nís, sin privilegios para nadie) no existe ninguna potencia mundial ni país poderoso que la respalde. Quienes piensen que paises como China e Irán van a participar en un escenario como este están muy equivocados, porque cada uno de ellos están participando en un juego geopolítico en el que Venezuela no es precisamente una prioridad, sin tomar en cuenta que no estamos en su misma región geográfica.<br>  <br>  Así que Chávez, lejos de ganar respaldo diplomático que le ayude a sentirse seguro dentro del ambito internacional, agrede incluso a aquellos mismos paises que hasta hace unos meses podrian ser sus mas grandes aliados (pero aliados por conveniencia, no por afinidad política) como Chile, Brasil y la mismisima Espa?a, quien hasta no hace mucho, a raiz de un incidente en el que como cosa muy extra?a la monarquia se unio al gobierno espa?ol, cerraron filas "y apenas ahora es que se vienen a dar cuenta" del talante autocrático que tiene Hugo Chávez.<br>  <br>  Por lo tanto, no es descabellado que el presidente venezolano sienta miedo, y claras muestras de ello da cuando se comporta con su típica bravuconeria, tratando de enmascarar el pánico que siente por las consecuencias que tendrá que afrontar una vez sea despojado de todo poder. Ya lo hemos visto dos veces huir y dejando las turbulencias provocadas por él mismo detrás, abandonando a la suerte a quienes lo siguen (y a quienes no) para despues venir con unas excusas baratas que ni él mismo se las cree. Y lo veremos salir huyendo una tercera vez, y él mas que nadie sabe que ese dia está próximo, solo que se aferra a la falsa impresión de que TODA Venezuela, o al menos sus seguidores, saldrán a la calle a inmolarse por él. Nada mas lejos de la realidad, porque al fin y al cabo el gran grueso de sus seguidores podrán ser fanáticos, pero locos no estan para permitir que los maten a ellos o a aguno de los suyos por nadie.<br>  <br>  Es por eso que dudo mucho que sus pretensiones de poner a paises hermanos en contra logren dar fruto. Dentro del país existe una fractura muy grande que no permitiria que algo asi llegase a ocurrir, y en caso de intentarlo, fracasaria irremediablemente y no seria mas que otro grano de arena adicional al ya grande saco que tiene Chávez en su cuello.<br>  <br>  "El que siembra vientos recoge tempestades", pero es una lástima que seamos los venezolanos, sin importar la afinidad politica, quienes que tengamos que pagar los platos rotos que este se?or en mala hora le dio por tirar al piso en este país.<br>  <br>  Saludos desde Maracaibo, Venezuela.|`|IlNZ73jqaa	Recuerda que son dos ridiculizadas internacionales seguidas las que le han dado.

Venezuela también, pero desde afuera no se notaba, hasta que vino Chávez y se destapó la olla.<br>  <br>  Chávez es un síntoma de una sociedad podrida hasta la médula, como lo están (estamos) todos los países subdesarrollados. Sociedades donde las diferencias económicas son tan escandalosas que no dejan ni siquiera la posibilidad de la esperanza.<br>  <br>  Chávez no es un moderado. No es prudente. No es "confiable". Está más que medio loquito. Pero... La Venezuela pre-Chávez era, es y será inviable. Aún con el petróleo por las nubes. Si Venezuela no utiliza su renta petrolera para industrializarse y de ese modo dar trabajo a los pobres (y de paso dar ganancias a los ricos), la marginalidad, la delincuencia, la violencia crecerán. ?Y cuando se acabe el petróleo? ?Qué quedará? Los privilegiados (por ejemplo, los que tienen acceso a Internet para escribir estupideces por acá) tendrán que hacer peque?os sacrificios. Muy peque?os, comparados con todo lo malo que se puede evitar con eso.<br>  <br>  Soberbios, bravucones... ?sólo Chávez? Los del otro lado no sólo lo son, y más, sino que ni siquiera son débiles: tienen al grandote de la cuadra de su lado... A Chávez, a Fidel, no les queda más que lanzar bravatas (bueno, al pobre Fidel ni eso, en el estado en que está): saben de su debilidad, saben que el imperio los puede borrar de un plumazo.<br>  <br>  Yo no soy peronista ni lo quiero ser. Pero los a?os de Perón, a caballo de los 40 y los 50 cambiaron muchas cosas en mi país. De algún modo, y con mucho dolor, los argentinos comprendimos que el modelo agroexportador estaba agotado, que los tractores desplazan la mano de obra rural, y el pobrerío "pintoresco"* del campo se convierte en marginalidad miserable en la ciudad. La única redención posible es la industrialización. El peon rural se convierte en obrero industrial, y (educación mediante) la sociedad avanza hacia el desarrollo. Que no hace falta el clientelismo, los regímenes fascistoides, el culto de la personalidad, etc, claro que no. Pero si la oligarquía preexistente no resistiera el cambio (que a la larga la favorece, reciclándola en burguesía industrial) con tal adamantina (y violenta) obcecación, bien se podrían discutir las formas políticas más adecuadas.<br>  <br>  ?Por qué los venezolanos tan ofendidos porque un medio mulato-medio indio les mojara la oreja a los "due?os naturales" del país, no terminan por comprender de una vez por todas que Venezuela debe cambiar, porque no queda otro remedio?<br>  <br>  ?Acaso el 56% que obtuvo el tipo en las elecciones del 98 no es un mensaje que vale la pena escuchar? Lectura simple: "los grones** no saben votar, cualquier demagogo los enga?a". Lectura compleja: "se están cansando".<br>  <br>  ?No es acaso la "democracia" capitalista un sistema para que los ricos puedan mantener sus privilegios mientras el resto de la población tiene "cierta" influencia en los asuntos públicos, tan como elegir el apellido del tipo que va a manejar los intereses de la clase dominante? ?Cómo se resuelve la situación inteligentemente? Tienen un líder carismático, el pobrerío lo seguirá a muerte... Negocien. Sigan obteniendo sus privilegios. Auméntelos: cuando los pobres tengan la posibilidad de consumir un poco más, sus negocios florecerán mucho más que antes. Repriman el asco que les da el tipo, sonríanle... lo necesitan. Si lo derrocan, Venezuela terminará perdiendo 40 a?os como los perdió Argentina por la estupidez de voltear a Perón en el 55. Nunca podrán resolver las diferencias políticas, nunca volverán a tener gobiernos estables.|`|qJvfezeNaa	Hay hay amigo, cada vez estas mas y mas disosiado, ?quien se beneficia con la división de nuestros pueblos hermanos?

Si como Patrono consideró en algún momento que el trabajador incumplia con sus labores es decir, se encontraba incurso en alguna causal que pudiese justificar su despido, el patrono tenia la obligación de iniciar ante la autoridades competentes (Inspectoria del Trabajo en Venezuela), el procedimiento de Calificación de Despido.<br>  <br>  La prueba para desvirtuar el cobro de las horas extras sería, la asistencia del trabajador en entradas y salidas (si es que llevas  ese control) y así sucesivamente y asi vas desvirtuando los hechos invocados o demandados por el trabajador.

En el mismo trabajó durante semanas un equipo de especialistas.<br>  Una sola cosa: Cuando Cristina da conferencias en el exterior las preguntas de la prensa deben entregarse por escrito el día anterior (justamente para preparar las respuestas), y prohibe totalmente que se le "repregunte" durante la conferencia. <br>  En muchos casos, directamente ha impedido el acceso de periodistas argentinos. Lo que da una muestra de su "sincera espontaneidad".<br>  Un discurso no identifica a quien lo dice, simplemente es una herramienta política más, en este caso muy bien preparada.|`|08a12f507da259ce6199ae6a5f82a93caa	Pobres, su mente no da para mas, piensan que llego la mesías que solucionara todos sus problemas junto al care pollo.|`|6jzc3xuMaa	Linda la verdad cualquier discurso donde este el Mico MAndante no lo veo ya, pero confio en tu buen tino y espero por los Argentinos que hable con palabras verdaderas,un beso.<br>  <br>  Titina.|`|GwJ3QMcbaa	estoy de acuerdo, un discurso pueden ser 80% mentiras pero mientras a la gente le gusta eso ya es mucho, la verdad a mi me encanta escucharla y me enorgullese q sea mujer|`|TFBXJxuKaa	Creo que al ser mujer nos podemos identificar, además me encanta que las mujeres estén tomando el liderasgo de sus naciones,  porque creo que somos capaces igual o más que los hombres.<br>  Debo confesar que no mire el discurso por lo que sobre el mismo no puedo opinar buscare información al respecto y luego te contesto sobre el mismo.|`|jRBiBm2Xaa	Creo en el papel de las mujeres y en su superación.<br>  punto.<br>  <br>  Mientras no seamos la mayoría en los congresos y en la vida pública de los países, no creo que la crítica destructiva quepa.<br>  ( a menos que no seas Martha Sahagún de México)|`|kTORiNi5aa	La Kretina tiene el karisma de un ladrillo.

Hay que tener brios para decir semejante barbaridad, ?Pero claro, como no lo van a hacer si lo hacen bajo el anonimato de un foro como este! porque saben que si se les ocurre la brillante idea de defender esa locura frente a frente con otras personas, a los 15 segundos se quedan sin argumentos y apelan a lo único que conocen, el insulto.<br>  <br>  Y una cosa es que a uno le cuenten de alguien que sostenga que un régimen comunista es democrático, y otra cosa es verlo con los propios ojos. A mi lo que me produce es risa, porque la unica imagen que me viene de este tipo de gente es que primero no saben nada de nada y solo quieren aparentar, y segundo que solo deben relacionarse con gente tan o mas ignorantes que ellos mismos, porque la única manera que una persona hable y hable de lo que no conoce es que sea muy ingenua y que piense que nunca se conseguirá a otro que le eche en cara su error.<br>  <br>  ?Y para qué diablos tienen internet entonces? ?Para fastidiarnos y hacernos perder el tiempo con sus impertinencias y necedades, para chatear con el messenger y para pornear? ?Porque esa es la impresión que a mi me dan!

Yo visite mi familia del 16 al 30 de septiembre de esta annio despues de casi ya 10 annios que no los veia, regrese muy deprimido muy afectado emocionalmente, tuve varios problemas porque soy muy contestatario y no me humillo o humiyo ( no quiero que me esten corrigiendo mi espanniol )cuando mis derechos como cubano se me pisotean y encima se me quiere obligar a aceptar que me meresco que se me pisoteen mis derechos, en una ocacion un infeliz que se dice ser jefe de la contrainteligencia en el pequennio puerto pezquero de La Coloma en Pinar Del Rio intento agarrarme por el brazo con la intencion de quitarme una bandera cubana que yo habia comprado en el motel LOs Jazmines del valle de Vinniales y me le safe y no me deje sacar de un kiosquito de venta por moneda fuerte que tienen alli, entonces obligaron a un sobrino mio que iba conmigo que le quitaron su carnet de identidad a que me convenciera que fuera a la jefatura, entonces ya que veo que tenia la salida libre salgo y de un brinco me meto en el carro que lo habia parqueado al frente porque imaginate que por alli no habia ningun otro carro, vehiculo motorizado solo algunos carritos tirados por caballos y bueno ahi se monta mi sobrino una muchachita que iba conmigo que yo la quiero como si fuera mi hija, le pongo los seguros a las puertas y arranco el carro, entonces mi sobrino me cuenta que le habian quitado el carnet de identidad que si no iba a la jefatura podia caer preso; yo empece a cojer calor, me puse los guantes de manejar, abri una navaja que llevaba y la coloque cerca de mi mano derecha y le conteste vamos pa ya, la gente empezo a aglomerarse y no me quedaba mas remedio que manejar en la misma direccion acia donde quedaba la jefatura y sali en primera velocidad muy despacito, al irme acercando la calle tomaba un angulo acia la derecha y se ensanchaba un poco, pense doblar en U, miro a la izqierda y me percato que las casas daban fondo con fondo y habia un callejon zigsaguiante lleno de agua y fango por donde andaban carritos de caballo, no lo pense dos veces, les dije agarrense ( la gente que me habia rodeado por curiocidad o por caerle bien al tipejo aquel habia quedado un poco detras ) y acelero y me mando por aquel fanguisal que no se le veia salida, aquel carrito se bamboleaba de un lado a otro entre las cercas y por momentos parecia que se me iba a atascar porque se quedaba en el mismo puesto y yo con el pedal del acelerador hasta la tabla, yo me dije o me sacas de aqui o te rajo los pistones, yo iba aferrado al timon y mis acompanniantes apenas les alcansaba el tiempo para sujetarse y del susto no podian hablar lo cual me convino, bueno para no cansarlos despues de saltos y piruetas salgo a una explanada abierta con mas espacio y era porque se habian acabado las casas y vi la carretera, como pude por el talud me subi a ella despues de tambalearse el carro lo enderece y vi por el retrovisor la caretera pelada desierta llena de baches que yo trataba de esquivar y pedazos de fango que salia de debajo del carro volar, bueno la historia termino, ya yo me encuentro aqui en mi casa en estados unidos y con mas fuerzas y mas desicion de oponerme a regimenes totalitarios que den poder a gentes que apliquen la ley a su antojo simplemente porque trabajan para el sistema.

Yo creo que sí se puede por concesión, Bogotá es una ciudad tan densa que hace del metro un negocio rentable, mucha gente en pocos kilometros. Santiago de Chile con una población menor a la de Bogotá ocupa casi el doble de extensión. Lo único malo de las concesiones sobre todo con firmas extranjeras es que siempre le buscan el tumbe al país.

Porque callar, para un presidente asistido por el apoyo de un pueblo que democráticamente le ha reiterado su confianza a través de 9 elecciones sucesivas, implicaría traición, claudicación, y Hugo Chávez jamás traicionará su ideal bolivariano ni claudicará en la lucha por la emancipación de su pueblo. Porque callar sería imposible, después de haber acostumbrado la garganta a cantarle la verdad a los más azufrados diablos en las más exóticas y exquisitas asambleas del mundo. Porque para Chávez, que no sabe callar, silenciar sus denuncias en cualquier escenario sería un mal antecedente que Evo, Daniel, Rafael, Néstor, Luis Inácio y Tabaré, junto a sus pueblos, le reprocharían, y no se diga de Fidel que le acusaría de “no ense?ar con el ejemplo”. <br>  <br>  Porqué callar cuando nos sentimos asistidos por la verdad, la justicia y la razón, cuando la fronda de estas virtudes nos cobija. Porqué callar cuando los revolucionarios inferimos que desde las cordilleras chilenas, la agreste voz de los rebeldes se difundirá por valles, ríos, llanuras, lagos, monta?as y mares, y uno que otro V.T.V y TELESUR, para ser recibida y coreada por decenas de millones de latinoamericanos que la convertirán en el estruendo perforador de los reales tímpanos de borbones monarcas, que por desconocer el canto de protesta de los pueblos, sólo se atreven a tartamudear un trémulo “Porqué no te callas?”. <br>  <br>  Porque de ahora en adelante, reliquia monárquica, te vas a tropezar con el eco incontenible de la voz de los pueblos latinoamericanos que ya está trascendiendo a los pueblos ibéricos y un rotundo trueno republicano barrerá tus privilegios borbónicos y tu solidaridad satánica con Bush y con Aznar más temprano que tarde.<br>  <br>  Por  otro lado Te respondo que el Presidente chavez a sido  elegido  por casi el 70% de los Venezolanos y en cada elección gana mas adectos, investiga la verdad y no te dejes manipular por los medios tradicionales de incomunicación si lo atacan es porque es demasiado bueno, o como dice  Sancho, si ladran los perros  es porque estamos cabalgando, y te digo Chavez  si Dios lo permite, y sigue por el rumbo que su pueblo le a dictaminado creo que podrá llegar hasta el 2035, por lo menos para trandormar a Venezuela y sacarla de las  ruinas que la dejaron desde los 40 a?os de Democracia Punto fijista, y lo lamento por ti, no quisiera estar en tus  Zapatos y le  doy gracias a Dios de permitirme ver  y  haber vivido en estos  momentos porque la estoy pasando con mucha felicidad de ver los grandes triunfos y avances que esta teniendo la patria de Bolivar y te  digo Patria, Socialismo o Muerte Venceremos.|`|K9g9C0yuaa	Va a durar todo lo que el pueblo venezolano quiera, todo lo que haga en contra de eso se llama Fascismo y es antidemocratico.
