20090225080326AAWCO44	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer Problem - Random Shut Down - Hardware?	Hello      One day my computer is running fine the next day, its running really slow, the sound is scratchy, video freeze and skip.      So i reformatted, while reformatting i got the Blue Screen of Death      So i reformatted again it worked, installed windows xp, installed all the drivers for my hardware, installed the internet, playing around on the internet at this point the computer has been on for about an Hour and a half, then it just rebooted itself properly.      So it booted back up then i started to install all my programs back and it rebooted again. I'm pretty good with computers but i don't know what it could be.      Im guessing its a Hardware problem?

I ASSURE YOU, SPAM WILL BE REPORTED AND LINKS WILL NOT BE CLICKED!   -------------------   Thanks for your reply!       Okay, at the bottom is a link to where you can download the entire project. This a project for school so there are a lot of mini projects. What I am having trouble with is PracticeApps/GridView/GridView.aspx. Create a new AccessDataSource to Cars.mdb, create a new GridView, and see if you can get it to delete. For some reason the ability to delete records just went away. If you visit the application on my website it works and you can see for yourself that I had it working (that code is provided on the webswite as well). But now, when I try and do the exact same thing I get "No value given for one or more required parameters." This is making my life bad because I am learning ASP.NET and if I can't get this to work then I can't learn ANY of the Data Controls.       Here is a version of the application that works(go ahead and delete a record, notice it works)  http://www.seansbagoftricks.com/Practice...       Here is where you can download the ENTIRE project (theres a lot of junk in this project, hence the name junk)  http://www.seansbagoftricks.com/uploads/...

20090225132307AAzR8Hi	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	What is the coding that you type in to download .swf files?	Okay, so I have already seen this in the answer of another question, the problem is I cant find that question again. The instructions were to load a cflash game completely, right click and click view source, search for .swf in the document, highlight the page, and start a new Notepad document.  You then type in some coding that starts with <a or something like that and paste the webpage in the middle. You save the notepad document as .html and open it using internet explorer. It comes up with a screen completely white with a little link in the top left corner that says download. You right click and click save destination as or whatever and you have the .swf file. My question is, what is the encoding you type in notepad?

20090225132457AAdYJSu	Computers & Internet;Security	Security errors when starting up Windows Vista?	At the top of the box, it says what kind of computer I have:   AMD Athlon 64X2 Dual-Core Processor Windows Vista Home Premium      Every time I start my computer, I get a box that says: "Privacy Components | Simple one-click solutions for your PC." It then scans my computer and finds hundreds of "security threats," from sites such as the GMC and Cadillac websites and many others.       Whenever I try to fix the errors, it says my license software is out of date and I have to update them. When I try to do this it wants to charge me $129 to update the licenses. The only other given solution is to install a driver that my computer keeps recognizing as malicious.       I don't trust this Privacy Components thing at all, considering a lot of the words are misspelled and the graphics are slightly different from the usual Windows Vista interface - almost like a knockoff.      When I close the window I get a black screen and can't do anything with my computer. If I restart, I get the same window. I'm on another computer right now.      How can I fix this?

20090225133656AA6HEhJ	Computers & Internet;Internet;YouTube	How do you edit this video in a certain way?	Okay, so me and my friend want to put this one video on youtube. The actual video itself would be silent, but how do you add sound of you talking without it being in the actual video? like to overlap it.       I'll give you an example, it's kind of hard to explain.      Okay, so you are filming something silent, maybe a dog twitching, you don't want to say anything because the dog will stop. And you end the video. During the video, you want your voice saying maybe "here is fluffy twitching, enjoy" or something. How would you do that. I've seen people on youtube have that before. Or maybe they just ahd really good editing...i don't know      So is this possible?

20070520080208AA5PvRD	Computers & Internet;Software	Itunes trouble?	ok so i have itunes downloaded on my computer for some time, but everytime i open it i get this "preparing to install" message and i have to wait a good minute or so before it finally loads on my computer. i know its not a big deal but it seriously bugs me. i think this is due to me being lazy and not rebooting the computer immediately like i should've when i first downloaded itunes. someone shut down the computer before i even had a chance to restart it, so i restarted the computer the next day after starting up my computer. well apparently that didn't do anything, so i took a chance and uninstalled itunes from my computer and then reinstalled it, included with the whole restart computer thing. that didnt do any good, and i think i should turn off the computer for some time, but i'm afraid my songs will get lost in the process [i refuse to reorganize the millions of songs in "my music" folder] ...but should i? will i lose all of my songs?

I just reinstalled the OS and all my programs.  I used it for a week or so then noticed that I had an old BIOS loaded on the system.  I wanted to make sure everything was up to date so I tried to flash the BIOS.    The BIOS installed was a Phoenix A6 BIOS.  I tried a direct upgrade to A32, the latest on the dell support site; I then discovered through searches that Dell started its own BIOS with BIOS version A22, and that in order to upgrade to BIOS A32 (by Dell), I would first have to upgrade to BIOS A22.    As per the instructions on the Dell Site, I created a CD with the A22 bios. I flashed my laptop's bios - it went without difficulty so far as I could tell. "Upgrading from BIOS A6 to A22" completed, verified -  It then said, "restarting" - but now the computer no longer boots.    I power on, no image on the screen. If I start it up with a bootable CD in and the CD will spin up, but nothing will happen.     Is there a way to reset the BIOS?

20090225135131AAjeLK0	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	How fast should I be able to download?	I have a 7Mb/s (7MB/s?) connection from my ISP. At the current moment, using UTorrent, I am downloading at an average rate of 50 - 150 kB/s, but never more than 75kB/s for a single download, though it's usually around 25kB/s per download. I have heard of people who can download at much higher speeds, getting multiple gigabyte files in an hour or two.       I understand that the seed/leech ratio has something to do with this, and that the seeder's upload limit also comes into play, but when there are 10 seeders on, it seems to me that I should be downloading at a faster rate than 35 kB/s.       At the moment, I have my settings to unlimited downloading, and an upload rate of 15kB/s per file.       Is there some setting on my computer or router that is not configured correctly perhaps? I have a Cisco Linksys WRT54G2 router, if that helps at all.      Apologies if I am asking a question that has a "those are the speeds you are supposed to have" type of answer.

I now it sounds like a dumb question and it probably is but I think it's time for me to upgrade.  This May will be 2 years I own my Acer 3680-2633, my first brand new laptop, and I saw a special on a Compaq Presario for about $400+ at Best Buy.  I got gypped, almost $700.00 when I purchased this from a Best Buy with no web cam and just a 80 gb hdd.  I don't even think they make these no more. I should of at least gotten a printer and zip drive with it.  Obviously, I didn't know any better then.  I guess they were the thing then.  I've learned what I could with this.  If not I would like to donate it so that someone from a third world country can enjoy it like I did.

I bought it a few weeks ago, secondhand but relatively new and in good condition, and in the first few days it randomly shut down twice with no warning. After a few days it did it again, and whenever I tried to reboot it, I could hear it start to start up and then shut down. It did this several times before finally starting up again. I used Disk Utility to repair the permissions and this worked for a while, but then it did the same thing all over again today, even after I used Disk Utility again. The battery is secure. Why is it doing this? How do I stop it?

20090225134120AAUTABH	Computers & Internet;Security	Someone else logging onto Hotmail and Internet Banking?	Ok......      This is actually for a friend as I am not as stupid as to do this but she has asked me if I knew the answer and I don't so I would ask you guys.......               One of my friends gave her boyfriend (now ex-boyfriend) her email address (hotmail.com) and her password.      On there she had her log-on information for internet backing (HSBC) saved in a draft message.      He has logged onto there and told her exactly how much and where she has been spending.      Obviously she has changed her details and things with the bank but they have not been any help with the legalities.            Has he broken the law?      With OR Without her direct permission to log onto her email?   We are in the Channel Islands, UK so I don't know if this changes anything?            Thanks guys.
