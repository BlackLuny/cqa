Recently I was involved in a car accident ( I caused it) the officer cited me for speeding, but I was only doing 25 in a 40 when I hit the car in front of me. I was trying to avoid hitting a truck who slammed on his breaks and veered right, after i stuck the car in front of the truck, the truck took off, I have no way of identifying the truck except it was maroon and had four doors, I believe it was a Ford. Also, I was in a line of traffic so there was no way I could be speeding. Also, my air bag didnt deploy when I hit the car ahead of me, could that also be used as proof?

20090308034434AAulWx7	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	My husbands boss didn't pay him...?	My husband is an indentured 3rd year apprentice here in Australia as a baker.  He gets paid fortnightly and we rely on this pay to cover our bills as I am a fulltime student.  Last fortnight instead of being paid $1000 was only paid $400 with no notice or anything.  He rang his boss to see if there was a mistake and the boss brushed it off saying he'd pay him when he can because he can't afford it right now.  He couldn't provide an answer as to when he would pay up, or if they could expect to be paid next fortnight.  When I asked, he said he 'didn't have to explain himself to us'.  It was also revealed that he has underpaid my husband by 47cents an hour.  When I had a go about that he told me to 'get over it because it's nothing'.  Well, that over the last 12 months he was underpaid adds up.  So, my husband went to work this morning and did minimum work and came home early.  He made all the stuff, just didn't bake it.  The boss showed up 2 hours before opening and decided to close up shop because nothing had been baked (he could have done it himself in plenty of time).  So, his boss came around to our house and started threatening to fire him and saying his friends advised him to fire my husband on the spot and saying he had no right to do that etc etc and basically having a pity party saying we should feel sorry for him because he was broke.  he was also very rude towards me calling me a ******** and a 'silly girl'.  What should we do?  My husband has started applying for jobs, but there is nothing around at the moment and we can't live without his wage.  I've also started applying for jobs.  I'm not sure what we should do...

He paid the ticket at the county court house 4 days before his required date. It was a Friday morning. about 2 weeks late he gets a certified letter stating his liscence has been suspended for 6 months for failing to pay the ticket. He took his letter and the payment reciept back to the courthouse and was told by a clerk that it may have been posted since his payment was made 4 days prior that it may not have been registered into the system by the expiration date. However, his liscence is still suspended. Hw needs to at least go to work . I said go ahead and drive, but carry both the suspension letter and the reciept for payment. I'm sure thats the wrong thing to do. but untill we get this straightend out, he has no other way to get back and forth. public transportation dosn't exsist in this rural area of south Georgia. and no body would give him an 80 mile round trip drive including me. I understand that he also has to pay a reinstatement fee to get his DL off suspension. If your a patrol officer, and he told you this story what would you do to him given all this information ? In the mean time, does he need to go to court and have a judge at least let him aplly for a hardship liscence ? Or who handles that stuff, the DMV ? he is going to be 19 in 2 months, if he misses anywork he will get fired and that is what I'm trying to avoid for him. Is this something else other than just the payment not being posted into the computer. Or is it automatic to get a 6 months suspension when your 18 and younger ?

Tue.Mar3 2009   Geithner used the inheritance argument more than a dozen times during his appearance Tuesday before the House Ways and Means Committee.       OOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHH REALLY?      --------------------------------------...   Tuesday, Jan. 20, 2009 at 12:01 pm   Obama sworn in as the 44th president       4:35 pm : Financial stocks tumbled 16.7% Tuesday, registering their worst single-session decline since a 17% drop Dec. 1. Ongoing weakness in the financial sector has rekindled pessimism in the broader market.        As AP reports, immediately following Obama's speech, the major indexes fell more than two percent:    At the closing bell, major indexes were down more than four percent and the Dow Jones Industrials tumbled 332 points.       --------------------------------------...   Feb 17 (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama signed into law a $787 billion economic stimulus plan      The Dow closed 3.8 percent lower at 7,552.60 and the broader S&P 500 dropped 4.6 percent. An index of leading European shares had closed down 2.5 percent.   --------------------------------------...   Feb 11 2009   Reaction to the Geithner Plan   We know the stock market hated what Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner had to say about the new bank bailout plan yesterday. The Dow started tanking as soon as he opened his mouth at his 11 am press conference, and it continued its freefall as Geithner talked about the plan for the remainder of the afternoon.   --------------------------------------...     Obama sure can pick em, his appointing Tim Geithner was status quo.   Tim can not straighten out the economic plunge, that he himself had a hand in due to his former position, he only made it worse. Maybe this will take our minds off the fact he can’t follow the law and pay his taxes, so now Obama is in favor of fat cats who don’t pay taxes?                  Just what America needed THANK YOU OBAMA

20090308043926AASjU7b	Politics & Government;Elections	Is Obama a master of ambiguity?	Here is an example of a perfectly crafted statement of his.      "If you talk to Gen. Petraeus, I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists, but who were willing to work with us," said Obama.      A seemingly simple enough statement for sure, yet ,when dissected, the real craftsmanship is uncovered.      "If you talk..." - this is a primer. It sets the listener up into a suggestive state. He knows perfectly well that no one, being the listener, is going to talk to this general. He has redirected the listeners focus off of himself and deflected any negative responsibility while retaining any positive power that the statement might carry for himself.      "I think he would argue..." - He doesn't say that he "knows" the general would argue. He again has deflected any negativity and retained the positive...by this point he's teflon and nothing will stick to him.      "part of the success..."- here he has either said that the general is  claiming success yet as we go on you can see that he is claiming the success without actually saying that there was success, which would not jibe with his former statements on the validity of Iraq in the first place.      finally the use of "we" and "us"- he doesn't say who we and us are. Because he has established that the general is speaking through him,  again, he has taken no responsibility yet retains the positive aspect.

There's 2 cars in front of me. there's 1 turning lane beside me to the right. ahead in a big intersection with a medan strip in the middle, each side of the street has 3 lanes. i approach the right line in front of me, and saw a university of baltimore police directing traffic, waving the cars ahead of me across. the two cars in front went across the intersection. once i got to him i stop of course cause its a red light, but the officer directed me to keep moving, so like any other person would have did , i keep moving once i approached intersection i look to my left and since the cars sitting on MLK BLVD, THE LANE beside them look to apper empty, the nest lane i see a car flying pas me(lucky i didnt get hit by that one... once i seen him fly pass i started to rush across cause i didnt fell good about the situation but once i rushed i looked again and seen a car coming from the middle lane than boooooom!!. the car hit my ear panel by the wheel and pushed me on the curb.i talked to the driver who hit me and there light was green. there was no officer directing traffic on his side like the other side was. mind u it is a really big intersection which means one person cant control both sides it is impossible to. the officer got both parties info and then decides to sneak a way. i have his name and company number. more police comes to the scene to replace him, he claim he was directing traffic because there was another accident near by.       so the question is who would be in fault of accident? i was following instructions from the officer even tho my light was red. if i didnt follow his orders, i would be disobeying a law enforcement which is a charge.

Recently there have been high-profile feuds amongst conservatives.       Michael Steele's back-and-fourth with Rush Limbaugh.       An RNC committee chairwoman asking Michael Steele to step down, claiming ineptitude.      Republican Senator Jim Bunning from Kentucky is at odds with the Republican Party, and threatening Republicans that he'll resign, which means, his replacement will be appointed by the Democratic governor of Kentucky. A Democratic replacement would then give the Democrats a 60-seat fillibuster-proof majority.      Why all this party-infighting? Is the Republican party in disarray? In shambles? In turmoil?

20090308075515AAh1XBt	Politics & Government;Politics	Why don't devout GOPers ever have any reservations about their dishonest hackery?	For instance:      - Even though he's been in office for mere weeks, the economic collapse which obviously began long before he was sworn in is Obama's fault.      - Although Bush had 9 months and multiple warnings from multiple agencies and experts, 9/11 was not his fault.      - Reagan presided over three major downturns in 8 years, and the economy didn't resume growing until 2 years after he took office. However, that wasn't his fault because we say it wasn't. There is no inconsistency in blaming Obama for the current collapse (which, again, was already underway), but blaming Carter for the 1982 recession.      - The entirety of the current mess can be attributed to liberals forcing banks to make bad loans. Never mind that no banks were ever forced to make bad loans, or that most of the bad loans were made by unregulated private mortgage lenders, or that the Community Reinvestment Act actually strengthened income and credit reporting requirements, or that CRA-regulated loans are actually performing much better than the unregulated mortgages written since 2001. Those are all "facts," and facts have a well-known liberal bias. No, the entire collapse is due to the fact that Clinton outlawed the systematic financial disenfranchisement of minorities. Some of these people later paid their mortgages late, which crashed the entire world economy. It doesn't matter if that explanation makes no sense - sense has a liberal bias as well.       - Oh, and also - the roaring 1990's was the result of Reagan's policies, because we say so. Clinton raised taxes in 1993, which was the result of the 2001-2002 recession. Yeah, that's right - when it suits our agenda, tax rate changes have 9 to 10 years of policy lag. That's why we're advocating tax cuts to stimulate the economy.

20090308071254AAP77lO	Politics & Government;Elections	For those who voted 4 Obama, did U do so because U WANTED a socialist government, or because U didnt like Bush?	My sense is that American voters got a little frustrated this last election (November 2008) in that they may have wanted more than two electable candidates to choose from.   While some may has not LOVED Obama, they knew they HATED Bush (which was augmented with all the Bush-bashing that went on in the media, much of it undeserved and sadly, unchallenged by Bush when he was NOT responsible for every bad thing that happened).  So in the choice of who to vote for, it became the lesser of two perceived evils for some (although McCain was not Bush but he became associated by virtue of party affiliation).  "ANYTHING'S better than Bush!" became the mindset of many, so they voted for Obama, without necessarily examining just how liberal and socialist he was.  And since America has never been a fully socialist government, I'm not sure many Americans could even APPRECIATE what it would be like to become a socialist nation and all the pitfalls and ills that went along with it.      Now as Obama continues with out-of-control spending and a re-engineering of American government to institute a socialist agenda (versus paying attention to the failing economy and the REAL needs of present), American voters are starting to realize who they really elected and how radical Obama really is.  Goodbye Capitalism, Hello Socialism.      So this question asks, when you voted for Obama, did you know how far in the direction of socialism he was going to take the country?  Or were just impressed with his speeches, message of "Hope', impressive promises (many of which he's already abandoned in his first 100 days), and voted primarily because you disliked Bush?      I'm looking to hear mostly from those who voted FOR Obama as I know how most of those who did NOT vote for him will answer this question.  And for critics overseas who are not U.S. citizens or American voters, know our whole nation got dragged in this direction but that NO...we don't all believe in and support socialism nor have we abandoned capitalism as a way towards prosperity, growth, and individual freedom.

Why is it that people are allowed to take other people's medicine without their knowledge from a pharmacy and then nothing is done about it by the cops? Why is that they can commit crimes such as perjury, murder, police brutality and talk to you however they want and threaten and intimidate you also? Why are Judges allowed to talk to you in any way they want even when your not guilty or talking to them with respect like you should or when a witness that you have tries to speak and the judge tells them to sit down and shut up in a rude and nasty tone? Why can cops refuse to help you outright by not filing a report or saying they can't do nothing about your problem like a crime being committed against you? This is not opinion its based on experience and news stories. Wish I knew why things like this are allowed to go on where it's supposed to be free but seems that only law breakers are free and not the innocent of the victims of crimes.

20090308055254AArZZTv	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Does a woman in a sexual relationship have a "reasonable" expectation of becoming pregnant? Please read below.?	A woman enters into a sexual relationship with let's say a movie star or a professional athlete with the intention of becoming pregnant and scoring a huge child support settlement.  Later after she fails to become pregnant she learns that he has had a vasectomy about which he did not tell her.  Is the woman still entitled to the payments she would have won if she had become pregnant & delivered a child?  Does she have a "reasonable expectation" of becoming pregnant?   I say she does.  US courts have already established that a man has to pay child support regardless of the circumstances that led to a pregnancy, even if the woman admits in court that she lied to the man about using contraception.   I say that he has to pay if there is a child or if there should-have-been.   Am I right or wrong?

20090308075758AAmVRZF	Politics & Government;Military	Do you need a reason to not join a group but be a lone wolf patriot?	Four members of an anti-government group have been arrested on charges that include money laundering, tax evasion and weapons possession, federal prosecutors said Friday.      Authorities said the four men are members of the Sovereign Movement, a group that attempts to overthrow the government and defy authority with "paper terrorism." The arrests in Las Vegas on Thursday capped a three-year investigation into the group's activities led by the Nevada Joint Terrorism Task Force, U.S. Attorney for Nevada Greg Brower said.      A grand jury indictment in federal court in Las Vegas names Samuel Davis, 54, of Council, Idaho; Shawn Rice, 46, of Seligman, Ariz.; Harold Call, 67, of Las Vegas; and Jan Lindsey, of Henderson.      Davis and Rice are accused of laundering roughly $1.3 million for undercover FBI agents, who described the money as loot from a bank fraud scheme. Davis and Rice are charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering and 30 counts of money laundering. If convicted, they face up to 20 years in prison and a $500,000 fine on each count.      Davis was described by prosecutors as a national leader in the Sovereign Movement, whose members believe government licenses, taxes and currency are invalid. Rice described himself as a lawyer and rabbi devoted to anti-government teaching, authorities said.      Davis and Rice pleaded not guilty in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas late Friday. Call and Lindsey also were due to appear in court. Authorities did not know if the four had lawyers.      Brower's office said Call and Lindsey, a retired FBI agent, are leaders of the Nevada Lawmen Group for Public Awareness, a group affiliated with the Sovereign Movement.      Call is accused of possessing an unregistered machine gun, as well as parts designed to convert manual firearms into automatic weapons.      He faces two counts of possession and transfer of a machine gun and three counts of possession of an unregistered machine gun. If convicted, he could get up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine on each count.

20090308065959AA6KVyB	Politics & Government;Politics	I got two ideas to get us out of debt?	1.  Head Tax at the end of every year on every American resident (not citizen).  Head Tax = $150.  With 300 million Americans, that's 45,000,000,000 each year!     2.  Buy Britain for $100 billion and lease it to the Chinese or Indians on a 99-year lease deal.  Lease it for, say, $150 billion each year.  That itself would get rid of many current problems.  Also, tax each British person at the end of each year $150.  $150 * Britain's population = 9,000,000,000 additional.     Would any of these two suggestions work?

First, if everyone has the same right, to marry a member of the opposite sex of consenting age, who is being discriminated against?   Is gay marriage really about marriage? I've heard gay leaders calling their plight a civil rights issue, but then reject civil unions even though they get all the civil rights associated with marriage. Why? Is the motivation actually cultural, ie gay couples want society to regard them as equivalents to straight couples and want marriage to affect that change?   And lastly, how can marriage be defined as between only two ppl? Many other legal contracts allow for more than two parties. So how can marriage be defined as between two people by same sex marriage advocates?

Given the fact that embryonic stem cell research will be conducted on embryos from fertility clinics that would be discarded anyway, what is the possible objection to opening up this area of research?  Is your blind ignorance more important that curing the pain and suffering of literally millions of people. We have already delayed a significant amount of research for eight years  thanks to the mid evil superstition of the  pro death Bush administration.  Isn't it time to take off the hooded robes and come out of the cave?   Please don't bother with the imbecilic argument that the development of skin cell  research makes embryonic research unnecessary.  The scientist who developed the process warned that it should not be sued as a substitute from embryonic research.  So, armed with your high school biology and the arguments of the same people who brought holey healing cloths (available for a small monthly donation),  are your really arrogant enough to second guess than man who developed  the process?  That would make you either a charlatan or a fool.

YESTERDAY I ASKED THIS QUESTION:I was on my own in a shop with bras in my hand and this group of 5 boys came over to me and went 'my mate thinks you are really fit', i just looked at him and started to laugh. He started to ramble on at me and then went 'so i be you have a boy friend then' I lied and said yes, because i thought that would get rid of him, but it didn't. One of them then asked for my mobile number, i refused to give it to him then asked them to get lost. They didn't go so i walked off. They followed me so i turned round and yelled at them to **** off. Eventually after following me around for about 15 mins they left when my 'boy friend' (thanks ben btw) rang me. But they were still stood staring and smiling at me. What would you have done in this situation. In the end i freaked and left the shop... =[ i'm 13, they looked like 15 or something...         MY QUESTION FOR TODAY   i went back to the shop to buy the stuff i had put down yesterday and they were there. I thought i had managed to sneak past them until one of them smacked my ***, so i turned round and slapped his face. He then called me a horney b**ch and started making growling noises at me. I decided just to ignore them so i went to the check out paid for my stuff, then noticed he was reading the sizes of the stuff i was buying like my eg: my bras. So told them to **** off and leave me alone. I walked out of the shop and noticed they were still following me, i didn't want to leave the mall because i was like freaked out bout the fact there were like 9 boys stalking me. It got to a point when i really had to leave so i went to the loos because i knew they couldn't follow me in there. I hoped they would be gone when i got out: they weren't then told them if they didn't **** off now i would phone the police, one of them replied 'okay sexy, calm down, we will go, but don't worry we will definitely be seeing you again'!!!!!!!! Now i am like uba freaked out, what the hell should i do!?

She keep say a lot of stuff about him that I find very hard to believe. She claims he’s a body guard and says he live in a small penthouse apartment in expensive part of city (where people like doctor, lawyer, etc… can afford to live), and other stuff.   I find this hard to believe. My boyfriend who is 18 and about 6’2 and 230 or 240 lbs and he’s much bigger than him. My sister is like 5’8 and her boyfriend is just a inch or two taller than her and probably about 170 or 180 lb. He doesn’t seem cold or have very intimidating looks at all. He does carry himself with lot of confident though. He also dresses really sharp most of the time. He also looks to be in mid 20’s.    Other thing is, my boyfriend have tried to ask him about how he can get the job and stuff since he need a job. My sister’s boyfriend always tried to brush it off and say something like he just know right person. But if I ask him, he’d tell me he got the job through his former kickboxing coach who used to do some protection service. But if asked about details of his job, he gets all uncomfortable and uneasy and tries to change the subject. In fact he is always trying to avoid my boyfriend.   This is making me suspect that my sister is either lying or he’s feeding her false information. How do I know if he’s actually what my sister says he is or if he’s making all this up?

20090227142401AAPZYxP	Politics & Government;Politics	How are Politicians known to be corrupt?	Because they take money from lobbyists, lie and make up stories during their campaign and/or during their term, start unpopular wars, and don't fulfill promises? Like Hillary Clinton made up the story about gunfire in Bosnia. And Bush Jr. lied about Iraq with saying he was certain there were wmds there. When Politicians have office they don't always fulfill their promises. And Nixon was a President CAUGHT cheating on his re-election on Watergate. And recently a Governor was impeached for corruption. During the campaign politicians lie and attack other politicians to win the election.      Is that why politicians are known to be corrupt? What other reasons politicians are known to be corrupt?

20090227142023AA4hR9W	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Divorce Argument: I NEED COUNTER-ARGUMENTS AND CRITICISM!!!?	Please take a minute to read this. I need to answer all holes in my argument. If there is any concern that is needed to be answered, I would really enjoy constructive critisim. Anything I need to answer, add, get rid of, etc. This is for my English class, for a MAJOR grade. All of the help I can get is greatly appreciated.          Begin:   As we all know, everyone has had many different life experiences that make us unique. These experiences have the potential to shape our physical appearances and personalities in strange ways. Fortunately, many of you have not had to experience the divorce of your own parents. /Yet./ For the few of you have, you will know where I am coming from. For those who haven’t, please bear with me, and keep in the back of your mind, that this can happen to anyone./      Deanne grew up an only child in Las Vegas. She was a pretty girl, blonde hair, blue eyes, smart. In high school, she met a man who was five years older than herself. Allen was handsome and worked as a detective for the city. A beautiful young woman meets this dashing fellow. How could her life get any better? It was a perfect love story. Deanne took Allen to prom her senior year and, she wore an elegant, turquoise dress. Of course, prom night should be great. She was spending it with the man she loved. Not long after she graduated, they got married. They were so perfect for each other…/or so they thought.\ After two or three years, Deanne didn’t feel the same about Allen as she once did. Marriage wasn’t as sugar-coated as she, as well as many young girls and women, may have once thought. They got a divorce. \Unfortunately, Allen’s story didn’t have a happy ending. Allen committed suicide a few months later. /During the next year, she met another man named John. Deanne knew she couldn’t make the same mistake again. This was different. She was already out of high school, with a job. She loved this man! It was meant to be. So, they got married after only a few months of dating. Over the next few years, Deanne and John had two boys, Thomas and Ben. By the time Thomas was six and Ben was four, their parents’ relationship was falling apart. John was working all of the time, and Deanne always stayed home with her children. A year later, Deanne told her boys / that their father wasn’t coming home. The decision for a divorce was made final, child support discussed, child custody schedule set. All of their possessions were cut in half, including the time with their children. The boys stayed with their mother one week, their father the next. Thomas wasn’t able to handle the split and required counseling for his emotions. John was heartbroken. But Deanne knew she had to move on./It didn’t take her long to find someone else. Ronnie had two boys of his own. Deanne knew she had made two previous mistakes. This had to be real. It just had to. Wedding bells ringing at the church only /six /months /later…      Now here’s the real story: (Diagram)      Nevada = Georgia Thomas = Heather Ben = My little sister      Deanne is my mom. Allen is dead. My own dad’s heart torn to shreds. My old life gone.//               Marriage is the right thing for the right reason, but marriage can also be the wrong thing if it’s for the wrong reason. Same for divorce. Did you know that one out of every two people in the U.S. gets a divorce? That’s a lot. Why do we accept such a thing in this country? While it is impractical to outlaw divorce entirely, we can’t allow this to happen again and again. So this is what I propose. A time penalty should be put on divorce. The standard time penalty for a divorce will be five years, starting from the official court date of the divorce until the official date of the next marriage. For anyone above age 60, the penalty would go down to a standard of three years, due to the shortened years of life. The judge for anyone’s divorce case can decide to lower, raise, or even erase this penalty if he/she thinks necessary, depending on the case. I understand that everyone makes mistakes, but I’m not saying that divorce is always bad. But as a whole, this new law is for the greater good of society. Think about all of the celebrities today who get married. Do their relationships ever last? Rarely. Celebrities can’t escape this law, either. Britney Spear’s first marriage with Jason Alexander only lasted fifty-five hours. That is ridiculous. This is another example of why the commitment of marriage should not be taken so lightly. We want people to get married in this country, but for the right reasons. This law is very reasonable compared to other countries, such as Saudi Arabia or Iraq, where the penalty for divorce is death.      If one out of every two people in the U.S. gets a divorce, then that means that half of our country consists of people who have reneged on their promises. If you decide to go to college, then you most likely will have to take out a loan. Now, the bank trusts you to keep your word to pay them back on a timely manner. If

I place economy among the first and most important virtues, and public debt as the greatest of dangers to be feared. To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt. If we run into such debts, we must be taxed in our meat and drink, in our necessities and in our comforts, in our labor and in our amusements. If we can prevent the government from wasting the labor of the people, under the pretense of caring for them, they will be happy.   - Thomas Jefferson

20090308073258AAmzNOH	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Accidental shoplifting??? Help!!?	Basically, I went to a shop, looked around and walked out. Strangely though, at the back of my mind, i was thinking to myself (wouldn't it be scary if the alarms went off) that would be my worst nightmare. The idea of theft frightens me.   Then, i went into the next store. I bought a pair of trousers from there but somehow a pair of tights got stuck on my bag (no idea how!!!) and when I walked out of the shop, the alarms went off. I was in complete shock!. They opened the bag and it was right on the top of the bag. Then, i thought my life was over.   They called security, while i was practically s*****ing myself in shock how it magically appeared there and security took me to the back of the store. They then forced me to pay for it and I said that I had no idea how it got on the top of my bag and if i did want to steal it, i would have taken off the tag, hidden it deep inside my bag and stolen it properly, so hey! how could they believe that, even though it was true.   So i kept telling them 'i had no idea it was on the bag' which of course sounds ridiculous, but it was 100% true. The security guy said ' I'm just trying to do my job' in a rather sympathetic manner. They then threatened me and said 'pay for it, or we'll call the police'. That's when i was really 's****ing myself. So I tried to find anything to pay with (change) because i had no money. I spent my last ￡20 on the trousers. Luckily, i had enough coins to make ￡9 whatever it was and paid shaking like a chicken.   If i didn't have that money, i would have been ruined forever. Anyway, then they made me sign some form and banned me from all of that branches stores in the whole country, which when i heard, i couldn't believe. The woman said to me 'Even if you try to come in once, you will be arrested, not even 10 times, or 5 times, Do you understand me?' I wanted to slap her round the face. She was practically laughing at me. A pair of tights that magically appeared there- a complete accident caused all of this. My face is now recognized according to the staff, and i will be arrested if i enter another one of those stores again.   I was so upset and in such shock that walking out of the store with one bought item and one item that i must have accidentally took (i don't even remember it though) made me feel like an idiot. I cried all the way home, which again sounds stupid and when I got home, my parents believed me and were relieved i didn't get arrested.   Was it one of those 'wrong place at the wrong time things' or was it just supposed to happen?    Am i banned from just that branch of stores or every single store in the whole country? and also how long for??

20090308072100AAtqWQ7	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it even possible to eliminate age discrimination in the labour market?	I think it was back in 2007 that the [UK] government made it illegal to discriminate on such grounds.      Employment application forms usually ask for your DOB but if you choose not to answer it will be seen as 'having something to hide'. If an employer stated in writing that you were rejected for this reason then you may have a case for litigation, but in practice, that's very unlikely to happen. Also, unless you refrain from detailing when you were at school it's not rocket science to  approximate your age.      At the interview stage it becomes even more difficult.      I appreciate that the legislation was passed with good intentions but I do not believe that it's enforcible, and was therefore a waste of parliamentary time, and subsequently, taxpayers' money.

"Give to those based upon their needs by taking from those based upon their ability to give".      My wife and I went to get our taxes done yesterday. Both of us got good raises last year which did two major things.   1. It pushed us into a higher bracket.   2. We have 2 kids. Our child tax credit went from $2000 a kid to $1500 a kid.      These two things basically nixed our raises.      So what really gives people the incentive to do better if the government is going to take more and more from you?      This has got to stop.      Fair Tax all the way!

So I'm stuck in the middle and don't know what to do for the best, someone told me that if you've been here (UK) for five years you're entitled to a passport, is this true? and if it is true do you have to have been here legally for five years?

Muslims who do not join the fight are called 'hypocrites' and warned that Allah will send them to Hell if they do not join the slaughter.      There are many videos on youtube about this, how children are taught in muslim countries that non believers of islam are pigs and will go to hell. Watch movie "FITNA" as it explains the agenda of radical muslims taking over and supporting sharia law.   As an ordinary citizen how can you stop this? Killing muslims is not a solution so how can we change their mentality?

20090308075127AADa3jR	Politics & Government;Government	Are the current economic woes of USA tantamount to self inflicted wounds?	The more you think about the true reasons for the economic collapse....not the symptons, like people losing their homes and not finding jobs....but the actual down the nitty gritty reasons why people who work for a living in the USA and who are not rich are struggling is really because policies were intended to attack that section of the population. Perhaps the perpretators did not intend these results...in some cases I know they did, but if someone says they dont want to hire you and would rather someone else and is bent to not hire you, then that puts you at a disadvantage, doesn't it?  We have to look at the obvious.  Think of it like a boat out at sea that has sprung several leaks and is in danger of sinking, you have a pump and are using it to bail water but more water is coming in via the leaks than you can pump out.   We have got to plug the leaks that have led to the declining real wages of american workers, and unbalanced budgets and a 14 trillion dollar national debt, and a trade deficit.  We need to go to american stores and look at manfuctured items and see that most of them are made in the USA by the people who will be buying them.  We need to go to places of business and see americans working, and not a bunch of foreigners imported to drive down wages .  We need to have banks be banks and banks only again and to have walll street operate under common sense regulations.      This is not rocket science people...it really is not.  But have you noticed how litte talk there is of so called solutions that really get down to the actual roots of the problems?

Presentation : Name - S. Laurent, french citizen, college student.      Project : For the 2009 summer break, I would like to visit the US.  I'm already aware of all technical procedures and conditions such as subscribing for ESTA and having an electronic passport, which I both am entitled to.  (My country is part of the Visa Waiver Program)      Situation :    Back in 1998 : I was up for adoption (because of family crisis) and an american family was willing to adopt me ; at the time, I living in France.   1998 - 2003 : I went to the US and led a normal life (school), as my demand for getting a US residencial permit (green card) was going through judiciary process. Then, my BIOLOGICAL parents found me and asked if I wanted to return to France.  I accepted and went back to France on January 1st, 2003.   2003 - 2009 : I lived as a french citizen ever since, without any problems.      My question now is :    - Does the fact that I willingly came back to France, during the period where US immigration services were trying to give me a green card, thus abandonning my status as adoptive child, prevent me from being able to VISIT the US this summer as a TOURIST?    - Did my 'abandoning' of the US make me 'blacklisted' on US immigration files?   - Will immigration services at the point of entry of the US consider me as a somewhat threat and revoke my right to enter as a TOURIST, once already on american soil ?      I'm asking for your help because it would be careless of me to buy a plane ticket, travel all the way to the US just so that they tell me I can't go in because of my past adoption history.      Thank you

Im 16 years old and i was with my friends last night and we stopped over by a park to smoke some weed around 9:15pm last night. A cop rolled up and we didn't smoke any weed yet and a couple of my friends had weed on them, (4 out of 5 people, me being the only one who didn't have weed or anything on them) we all got tickets to appear in court on march 17th one of my favorite holidays, st. pattys day. If i was only in the car can i get in trouble? I'm 16 years old, didn't have anything on me, first conviction, have to appear in court on the 17th.    is their anyway I can get out of this?, in court if I told the judge it was my first conviction, I didn't have weed on me, we didn't smoke yet, I'm a good kid not a criminal, I'm a varsity wrestler for our school, and if I said to the judge that if he would let me off he would never see me in trouble again, any possible way I can be let off with a warning?

Hi,  I'm looking to go on holiday to the US this summer, I'm a British Citizen, always lived in the UK from birth etc.   I understand the procedure for the 90 day holiday visa has changed.  I'm a bit confused as to how I go about it though.    Every website says something different and one site even mentioned an interview at the embassy, surely they don't expect every holidaymaker to schedule an interview   A little help to clear the waters would be appreciated.

20090308090335AAMjCfa	Politics & Government;Politics	Should President Obama make an official statement on the murder of 2 soldiers in Northern Ireland?	This question applies especially to Americans.      Some of the answers to this question horrified me  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...       I hold most American people in a higher regard than I hold for my own fellow Brits but it seems quite a few are extremely out of touch.       My country's government may have committed atrocities against Ireland a long time ago (WAY before my time), just as your government committed atrocities against American Indians. They were both wrong but it's nothing to do with anyone who is alive today.      The IRA bombed civillian targets on a regular basis, killing and maiming innocent people, including women and children. If you regard the IRA as freedom fighers, one would have to assume that you'd condone American Indians bombing American cities several times a year?      Because 'only' a few dozen people were killed or maimed each time it wouldn't have made international news, especially back in the 80s/90s.      The reason that I'm asking if Obama should make a statement is that it seems many Americans are ill-informed on the issue.       I love the American people that I've met, but I'm British and 39 years old. I've seen footage of civillians lying dead on the ground with bloodied survivers crawling out of the carnage and it's a sight that I NEVER want to see again.

20090308090451AAoV78Z	Politics & Government;Politics	Is it OK, that the US is bailing out European Banks too?	Turns out that with the Bush bailout last year, a lot of the taxpayer money going to AIG is actually going to save European banks. The implications that US taxpayers are bailing out the bank, Societe Generale, via proxy through AIG, cannot be something Mark Penn, one of AIG's new PR men, would have preferred got out.       http://ca.reuters.com/article/businessNe...       Some of the recipients of AIG money to be UK banks including the Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds, Barclays, and HSBC Holdings.      And, as it turns out, without the US to bailout AIG, all of Europe is screwed. Of course, as it is now, if Europe goes down, we all go down, and vice versa.

20090308085604AAfApGw	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do you think the most recent election(US) helped the Libertarian party?	I was raised in a republican family and voted as such without a second thought. For the 08 election I was seriously not impressed with the republican candidates and thought WTH, I'll look at the democrats...I ALMOST VOTED FOR OBAMA. Thank god I didn't because I didn't need whats going on now on my conscience. But this big fight between the supposedly only 2 parties worth voting for has gotten me to look at the libertarian party. Seems like there's a lot less to compromise in my person opinions and beliefs.      I'm just wondering if this happened to anyone else?

We have not so close family in Toronto but after doing some research Vancouver looks like a better choice for weather and way of life.    I am looking for advice on areas to live for work and schools?   Is it really as good as everyone is saying?    Are the salaries on par with the UK?    Is the weather really as bad as people say?   Maybe strange question but what is racism like in Vancouver? My wife is Indian and we get a little bit here but not much and wouldn’t want to fall victim and make life hard.
