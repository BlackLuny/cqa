Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. -- Numbers 31:15-17       (Some of the non-virgin women must have been pregnant. They would have been killed along with their unborn fetuses.)          Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a miscarrying womb and dry breasts. -- Hosea 9:14          Yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the beloved fruit of their womb. -- Hosea 9:16          Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped up. -- Hosea 13:16          The priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell. And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And the woman shall say, Amen, amen. ...       And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse among her people. And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall be free, and shall conceive seed. -- Numbers 5:21-21, 27-28          Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt. -- Genesis 38:24
20090309120559AA9pZTv	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Most guys know this, but what about girls?	Okay, now most guys worry about the size of their penis, correct? However, it is just something that they need to live with. I have no  concern of my size or anything like that. Although i was just wondering, do girls realize (the majority of younger girls, i am 15) that size does not matter that much? I ask this because my girlfriend is about to give me a ha**job or possibly a bl**job and i am curious if she would know that size is not all that matters and that my size is a little above average, which in my opinion average seems a bit small. Also my major concern is that she has been with another guy before and i am curious to know if she is going to be comparing the two?      So overall, do girls know the same facts that most guys do?

20090309121043AAkAZkT	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Is this bad etiquette and what would you have done?	Every Sunday morning, my husband and I go to a well-known restaurant for breakfast. (Cracker Barrell) As we got there the hostess told us the wait was 10-15 mins. which we though was great! Every other Sunday is 25-35 mins sometimes longer. Anyway, as they called our name we walk up to the hostess stand and she proceeds to make small talk as we wait for someone (server) to get us and take us to our seat. Along with our name she also called out another name which happened to be an older couple...As they got up there the hostess says to them "We got you your table by the window" and also made small talk giving the impression that they are regulars as well. Since we were there first, the server got us and took us to our table but the bust boy happened to be cleaning it still, she starts making small talk. She then takes us to our table which happens to be by the window. The table across from us was not by a window. We take our seat and maybe :30 to a min later, the older couple takes their seats in the across from us (which wasn't a window table). As he sat, he shot us the dirtiest look ever! He didnt say anything (to us) but he made a huge deal out of it by calling the manager, server, hostess everyone to his table individually and talking to them. All the while staring at us. We had no intention of taking their "precious table" nor we would have cared if we sat there or by the door really... My husband and I are used to getting looks like this anyway since he is black and I am hispanic...aparently people have that stupid mind set! Anyway, if you knew you "accidently" took someones table like this would you get up and give it to them or just stay seated and eat. I suggested this to my husband and he said "What are you stupid?! we were here first and it wasn't even our fault! I'm hungry, I happen to like this table, eat and ignore him!" So we left it at that, but what a coincidence that as we get up, the man gets up to pay his bill as well, the whole while staring down at my husband. My hubby just acted like he wasn't even there, but it was so disturbing to me! I wouldnt have had a problem with saying "We couldn't help but notice...blah blah...have your table back" aparently my husband would have minded though. Would you have done the same thing and have you been treated this way too in the past??

I'm a twenty two year old male and never felt attraction to either sex.  I'm clinically depressed and scared that I'm asexual but unlike most posts I've read I do believe this is wrong and truly want to sexually be with someone.  Are there any hormone treatments or anything else that can treat asexual individuals and give them a libido?  I do not want to go through life alone.  Please do not respond with "this is who you are, deal with it."        This issue makes me suicidal and I feel it could be related to my depression.  I was not on antidepressants until recently and still felt asexual so that can't be the cause.  Please help me, if there are no ways to go about getting help for what I see as a huge problem I'm not sure I'll be able to continue living.      Thank you for your time.

20090227150904AAPtKIz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheist/Evolutionist?  How do you explain the dog that was blind for millions of years?	Imagine being there when the first dog evolved. There was a big bang, and millions of years later an animal with a tail and four legs, a liver, heart, kidneys, lungs, blood, ears and eyes evolved into the first dog.       Fortunately for him, his eyes had evolved to maturity after millions of years of blindness, so that he could see the first female dog that had evolved standing by him. It was actually very fortunate, because if the female dog hadn't evolved also and been at the right place at the right time, with the right parts and the willingness to mate, he would have been a dead dog. He needed a female to keep the species alive.        http://www.pulltheplugonatheism.com/art1...

Today I read in a book I question that impressed me:      "Do you really think that a Jewish mother went into the gas-chamber with her child only to pass from that hell into another?"

So how could he have made it then? He couldnt have could he? I dont know I ammm sooooo confused. Could somebody please help me. 10 points to somebody who can help explain it.
20090227152337AAx9t0S	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What's the evidence that supports an event before the Big Bang and can it be proved?..?	According to The Big Bang theory it came from an event which existed before it, is there any proof it existed and are scientists researching this even though some scientists would argue that something that cant be proved does not exist?..       Does this mean scientists believe the Big Bang came from nothing or do they believe the Big Bang came from an untestable event because its beyond time and space, which in science means the event does not exist, which is it?..

20090227152216AAc0N8m	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there two types of atheism; passive atheism and active atheism?	If you’re a passive atheist, then you’re the type of atheist who would let their children get brainwashed into a religion to keep the family happy. You would even pretend to pray, clasp your hands and hold your head down when grace is being said before a meal, hell, you might even say grace yourself! If you’re this kind of atheist then you suck! If you’re an active atheist, you’re on the internet ranting about the lies, stupidity and hypocrisy of religion. You’re out in public declaring your lack of belief in the common delusion and the lies of creationists fill you with an intense passion to oppose them. If you’re this kind of atheist then you have my deepest respect, love and admiration even, because you are making a sacrifice for the good of humanity, a sacrifice far greater than any brainwashed religious coward. So, which kind of atheist are you?

20090227152646AAHowOn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Pagans. . .Ive been avoiding asking pagan questions here. . .but?	I've been thinking over the past week or so about gettin a cauldron for my practices at home.  I was wondering IF I just wanted to use it for holding water/cleansing/and non-heated items would it be okay if one made a cauldron out of clay?  I've been making dishes and items for my own personal use and I thought it'd be nice if I could make a little/medium size one for starters.      Now for the usually "stuff" one must put in their questions:   1. this question is directed at pagans who use cauldrons, I know not every pagan uses a cauldron or knows about them.   2. this question is not for christians who want to tell me and others that pagans are evil and such. . . obvously I and others on this site have been happy and nonevil pagans for a while now.   3. sorry for all the grammer, spelling, and any other mistakes you might find, I have learning disablities and such that hold me back in some areas of life. . . the above mentioned ones included. . .   4. if your going to answer with out adding any useful info about cauldrons please deposit a cookie at the front desk.       I think I covered the usually "stuff" one must add to their question to get a direct answer. . .thanks again.
20090227151505AA9LVGO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is the media right about the Quran?	Following on from my earlier question, I have recently begun reading the most 'controversial' chapter in English of the Quran as there was a lot of bad press on this so i felt i need to look into Islam.      (Chapter 9 Verse 5)   'then kill them wherever you find them, and capture them and besiege them, and prepare for them each and every ambush'.      I remember reading this on headlines on The Sun - this sentence from VERSE 5 - not verse 1 lol - but 5.    I have looked into WHEN and WHY this chapter was reveiled and to tell you the truth - it has been taken purely out of context.      As a student of comparative religions, whenever i use proof from the bible to prove a point about christianity using many sources from the bible - people tell me i am taking it out of context. But surely taking ONE line out of a chapter of 129 verses without looking into the context is EXACTLY the same thing isnt it?      I just dont see what the media are saying to be there......... dont get me wrong the line is there but the message the media want us to think isnt.      A. Why has this been done by the media?   B. So why are there double standards?
20090227154036AAA6oUz	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	I think there is a chance I'm a psychic vampire.?	Dear Yahoo! Answers,        There are many reasons of why I think I am a psychic vampire, number one starting with I can see auras. Number two, I always feel drained, but, once I concentrate on a person for a few seconds until I see their aura, I get a boost of energy. Almost like a shot of liquor. A sudden boost when I was feeling tired, grouchy and drained. Number three, I burn very easily in the sun. I have a fair amount of other traits, but, these are the main traits of the psy. vamp. I'm 13, which is when some people awaken, or so I've read.         So, can someone give me some answers? I'm really freaking out.

20090309135654AAFyAol	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Please read.HOw would you guys react to this situation.?	Please read. I'll make this as short as I can. My sister found out she was pregnant instead of being honest with her best friend at the time she told some phony random lies to her to cover up the truth, she acted really weird. Our grandma died that same day too.I guess it was her way off handling the pressure situation. She called her up the next day to apologize(her friend knew she was lieing at the time) but her friend felt so hurt and betrayed she cut her out of her life. My sister later went to her house and bought her chocolate. But she wanted nothing to do with her. She later said that friends should not be so much drama even though this was there first fight. Its been 3 months and she still mad.       HOw would of you reacted to this situation Would you look past the lie and help her?is she beings selfish selfcentered and a fair weather friend?   Or does my sister deserve this since she lied to her face and now cant be trusted.       By the way my sister had a miscarriage so shes no longer pregnant.

20090309135544AAdVxQJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why did the son of God come 2000 years ago?	There are a bunch of events that happen in the Bible, where God himself decides to do something drastic... Like when he flooded the Earth and spared Noah or leveled Sodom and Gomorrah..      But what was happening in the world 2000 years ago, so drastic, that God would send his only son to the earth at that time?        I don't know for sure, but it seems like today's world is so much more immoral and corrupt... and in need of someone of Jesus' caliber, then it was two millenia ago.        I don't doubt he came, and I don't doubt he was who he says he way, I just want to know what the state of the world was back then, and why God felt that was a good time to send his only son to die for our sins... and not say, 400 or 100 or even 10 years ago instead.

20090309142152AAa0GhN	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Senior Citizens	What type of flower represents your personality?	Chrysanthemum flowers symbolizes a strong life. It is good to give old people chrysanthemum flowers because it means strong life. However, only red ones would be good because white and light yellow ones are used only at funerals. Lovers do not give chrysanthemum to their loved ones.       Do you have a flower that represents you?

20090309141356AATbIiK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people assume religion = a lack of education?	There are many religious people who are highly educated, so what's up with those people who assume you must be stupid if you believe in a higher being?        (My bio.112 professor's religious, as well as my chem. 101 and 102 professor.  We also have a majority of hindu people who are TA's and conduct the science labs.  How are these people less educated than someone who isn't religious?)      And for those of you who're planning on posting the negative correlation between religion and education, I think it's only fair to inform you that correlation does not prove causation, therefore, the information you have cannot be used to factually justify why you believe religion=a lack of education.  Find another excuse.      Thanks.
20090309144609AA3T99X	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: Do you ever get sick of just being you?	Not being gay but just like everyone expecting you to be the same the whole time?      Like i know what its like to be bullied and stuff so i like to help my friends and its usually all good. Even if they dont wanna talk about stuff im always good for a hug. But then today i was in the middle of my own minor crisis and all any of them were like is "oh fine dont talk to me then" and like coming up to me and being like "why arn't you happy? you're always happy!" And i just felt like screaming no im not always happy, im usually ok but thats not the same as being happy. I just get sick of being the "strong" shoulder to cry on and not being able to just cry myself or talk to people cause they think im some kind of super human without emotion. I have a major inability to cry even when my teacher (who i was really close to) died i couldnt cry for weeks. So maybe i am but tbh i basically got dumped by my gf changing her relationship status on facebook and telling all our friends we split up. No explanation nothing and now she wont answer my calls :( and it really hurts but i cant get it out of my system.

My best friend has a trouble apologizing to people.She told me today that she wont apologize to anyone unless she feels bad for for behaving a certain way. So I in return asked her what if you hurt someone really bad (like said something really mean) then would you apologize? and she said no not unless she feels like she did something wrong.   But the thing that gets me is that if I feel like I really hurt someone and I was at fault then I would apologize but she claims that even if she is wrong and doesn't know it then she would never be sorry. She also said that people are like that.   Are they? I'm not that way, what do you guys think?And what should I say to her about it because she has hurt me numerous times and never apologized. I'm going to tell her tomorrow that you apologize to people for THEIR sake and not your own because you hurt them whether you want to believe it or not.

20090309143118AAvKkEr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question for people with a deep understanding of Celtic cultures.?	I was reading a novel published in 1927 called Harangue by Garet Garrett and was baffled by the following passage: "His manner, although more offensive than before, had changed. For as they looked at each other a Celtic sign appeared between them. Extremely unlike as types, and by reason of that unlikeness mortally antagonistic, still both were Irish and therefore related in a manner too subtle for non-Celtic understanding. Further offence, if any, would be personal and so intended."      This novel takes place in the United States. My question is what is the "Celtic sign" in the passage? Why is it significant? I am simply not familiar with the culture of Irish-Americans of that period.

I usually have Bette Midler playing as I take off.  GOD gave us the Miracle of Flight, so it's best that we give back to him in worshipful song.  Sometimes I forget to give glory unto Him.  This is for you, God:       Oh, oh, oh, oh -   It must have been cold there in my shadow,   to never have sunlight on your face.   You were content to let me shine, that's your way.   You always walked a step behind.      So I was the one with all the glory,   while you were the one with all the strength,   A beautiful face without a name for so long.   A beautiful smile to hide the pain.      Did you ever know that you're my hero,   and everything I would like to be?   I can fly higher than an eagle,   for you are the wind beneath my wings.      It might have appeared to go unnoticed,   but I've got it all here in my heart.   I want you to know I know the truth, of course I know it.   I would be nothing without you,   I miss everything about you.      Did you ever know that you're my hero?   You're everything I wish I could be.   I could fly higher than an eagle,   for you are the wind beneath my wings.      Did I ever tell you you're my hero?   You're everything, everything I wish I could be.   Oh, and I, I could fly higher than an eagle,   for you are the wind beneath my wings,   'cause you are the wind beneath my wings.      Oh, the wind beneath my wings.   It must have been cold there in my shadow,   to never have sunlight on your face.   You were content to let me shine, that's your way.   You always walked a step behind.

I understand both sides but having trouble finding out my true opinion.    No on 8-For gay marriage   Yes on 8-against gay marriage.   if you are against gays i know it says its wrong in the bible but it says the same thing about divorce, i think its unfair to "pick" sins. Thats only 1 reason y i am no on prop 8.   I would be yes, because it does say it in the bible and i should stand up for my faith right?   So i am lost.   btw i am a Christian

I am currently post commander(supervisor) over six security guards for a well known company, however I'm not understanding what is going on with the company.I have six guards two per shift, there was this guy named George,we worked together for three months, he was removed because of a certain "smell" that employess would smell from him, the property manager, pulled me aside and asked was he drinking, I told her no it was mouthwash, so I had the branch manager calling me asking me about it, again I told them, after adressing it with george, he told me it was mouthwash anyhow they removed him after receiving complaints.So I get a call from the field manager, telling me that they would be placing on of the part time night officers in georges shift, which is duing the day, I advised him, that wouldn;t be a good idea, because I ve worked with him, and our personalites dont mesh well plus, he doesn't do his patrols, he just sits on his phone all night..and he doesnt do his job, so I've been working with this fellow for two weeks, and he keeps making mistake after mistake, he suppossed to be stationed at the gate, this man leaves the gate open, and leaves his post to make a phone call, and my car gets taken,I try to cover for him, I told the office, he just didn't see the people who repoed my car out the parking lot he was suppossed to keep secure.

20090309141953AAf9bYJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Wouldnt a relatively new religion be considered more accurate than a religion formed 100s of years ago given..?	....the current scientific knowledge we have. But any religion based on centuries old beliefs will not be an accurate representation of  how things are because it is based on the limited knowledge of the time. For instance you could say that quantum science is a religion based on theories of the nature of reality at the subatomic level, some theorise that there is consciousness at that level, some theorise of other dimensions, these theories could be considered a more accurate basis for a religion than something based on an old understanding of the nature of the universe?? I guess a lot of people will say that relatively new religion is Atheism!!

And the Lord our God said unto us: "Behold, they are one people, and (this) they begin to do, and now nothing will be withholden from them. Go to, let us go down and confound their language, that they may not understand one another's speech, 1 and they may be dispersed into cities and nations, and one purpose will no longer abide with them till the day of judgment." [23]. And the Lord descended, and we descended with Him to see the city and the tower which the children of men had built.    http://sacred-texts.com/bib/jub/jub25.ht...  -SOURCE       i always wondered who are those "we" which God turns to   but after reading the Jubilees's version where first person form is used it got me much more curious   but i still have no idea who are "the we"

The ALL our God the ALL [is] ONE!"   it also holds that this thing from which all is created is conscious and completely perfect and idealised because it is infinite   and if The ALL is perfect and this world is The ALL then the conclusion is that the world and all of which is inside of it is perfect   and the Ying-Yang duality such as "above-below" "hot-cold" "feminine-masculine" and even "good-evil" is nothing but a mere illusion   this philosophical hypothesis is very popular among the followers of Aghori   now i would like to ask your own opinion about this   and a question which is directed specially towards those which Hermetism:   do you suspect that this is just another of those half truths which the Kybalion warns us about?   for non-Hermetists: the Kybalion uses an example of a half-truth which is based on the question "if this world is just a thought of The ALL does it mean that this world is unreal?" and then analyses it in the following chapter:    http://www.gnostic.org/kybalionhtm/kybal...

I hear this term alot from gay/bisexual guys in the gay scenes "There's no such thing as a straight guy..every guy is either gay or bisexual, I actually had sex with a so called straight guy". I wonder why alot of gay/bisexual guys think that way. I'm guessing its because they used to being around all types of gay/bisexual guys all the time (hardly around straight guys) to a point were they have a feeling that every male has homosexual in him since you can't really tell a bisexual guy apart from a straight guy! Do you have any gay/bi male friends that have said this once...what you think about it? Me personally I believe there are guys that are straight!

20090309144235AA6yM51	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Why do men not like women who go to the gym?	Seriously why do men not like women who go to the gym, are they sexist or something, I go to the gym almost every other day, I eat right and I want to build a little muscle, when I go to the gm I see other guys my age and all, but never and girls? Seriously WTF?    Then when I go the weights and pull-down bar, they all stare at me, partly because I have skinny arm bones, but the fact that I can manage to pull down more weight than they can pull down handle, does that piss them off or are they just sexist? Real-life example, I went 2 days ago, I usually do my routine, when i go to the pull-down machine there is some dude my age, pulling down a 60lb, I wait cuz there is only one machine, then the dude gets off and works on some other near-by machines, then I go to use the machine, I usually use a 70lb, cuz that's normal for a 30 rep, at 4 sets for me. I can pull down 100lbs but I use 70lb. Then just total blank stares, and I know this because the gym has mirrors everywhere,         Total blank stares all directed at me the dude even signals his friend and then they both stare at me, oh the awkwardness.

(past the whole porn lesbian stigma)?	outside the stigma that all lesbians are pornstars, or chicks who dabble or say theyre "bi" for that extra attention. im talking down to earth lesbians who im told look "manly", but unless theyre bull dykes i dont see it?   i had a really good friend of mine (who was a hardcore lesbian) with whom i really connected and valued, there were times we hooked up but that wasnt "it", i genuinely really liked her and i always got the vibe it was mutual, ive already told her how i really felt about her twice (i was drunk.) and that has never driven a wedge between us since (or even made things weird since i always respected who she was and would like to just stay at a good friend level, she's gay you know? if i was a chick i too would go gay, women are just better i think) now shes leaving and while this is like the 4th or 5th time we grow apart i feel like i may or may not see her again, but thats not the issue,   it seems i have adapted a form of "gaydar" which draws me to lesbians more than ever, and its happening pretty often now. what is going on? i mean i like it but am i peeing against the wind? is it the chase or gold medal (which is pretty weak since, you know, theyre used to chicks) which draws me? do chicks feel the same way with gay guys? wtf is wrong with me? why cant i stop thinking about my friend even though im trying so hard to get over it? am i realy just wasting my time?

Sacrifice brings forth the blessings of heaven;   Earth must atone for the blood of that man.   Wake up the world for conflict of justice.   Millions shall know "Brother Joseph" again.

When I learned that  A former Israeli President is being tried for rape, I wondered how an orthodox Jewish society could accept such characterless candidates for the top slot. So I asked in the answers forum and got the following reply:       " Israel is a truly Orthodox Jewish society? ROFL, I can tell you've never been there. Most Jews in Israel are far, far more secular than secular Jews in the Diaspora " .      Almost all participants replied in a similar manner. I wonder, if this is the case, how do you guys expect to get Divine Succour with such permissiveness? Don't you believe that end of time is just round the corner and you need Divine help to survive its trials and tribulations?

20090309155816AAMIlXU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is the type of Proof that Todays' Jews are tracing there Tribal Ancient Ancestry?	Just curious of the Methods that some say they can prove they are a a  Levite? What records did you use and where are they located?      KINGSHIP WHEN JESUS AND THE JEWS WERE IN ISRAEL   Kingship       To understand the need for these two genealogies, it is important to understand the two requirements for kingship in the Hebrew Scriptures. These were developed after the division of the kingdom after the death of Solomon.…       One was applicable to the southern Kingdom of Judah, with its capital in Jerusalem, while the other was applicable to the northern Kingdom of Israel, with its capital in Samaria. The requirement for the throne of Judah was Davidic descendancy. No one was allowed to sit on David's throne unless he was a member of the house of David. So when there was a conspiracy to do away with the house of David (Isaiah 7:5-6), God warned that any such conspiracy was doomed to failure (Isaiah 8:9-15).       The requirement for the throne of Israel was prophetic sanction or divine appointment. Anyone who attempted to rule on Samaria's throne without prophetic sanction was assassinated (1 Kings 11:26-39; 15:28-30; 16:1-4, 11-15; 21:21-29; 11 Kings 9:6-10; 10:29-31; 14 8-12).       With the background of these two biblical requirements for kingship and what is stated in the two New Testament genealogies, the question of Jesus' right to the throne of David can be resolved.

I've been in love. Twice, actually, and I'm currently dating my second love. I've never been married, and I'm not a virgin.      I just don't see it as a sin because waiting for a true love doesn't mean waiting for marriage. It means waiting until you have a connection with someone. You don't have to be married to be in love.      Also, I've been told that I should wait until I'm married because I need to wait until I'm responsible. But how would getting married make me suddenly responsible?

20090309162042AAeokT5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why would God allow “imperfect beings” to be his messengers?	I don’t believe in the Christian God, but if I am wrong about his existence, is there no wonder today’s Theist have so much trouble converting Atheists since they admit that all men are “flawed?”        Hell truly sounds like a horrible place.  What most theists don’t realize; however, is that the Hell of the Christian God is something very distant and can not compete with the “Hell” that most of us are experiencing right now.  The idea of a loving God sounds really nice, but it is hard for some of us to fathom because reality is in conflict with most of the compelling principles contained in a lot of religions.        The one unifying concept is that imperfections of mankind are responsible for the misery we are experiencing.  This unfortunate truth will always prevent analytical people from becoming believers because the same “imperfect beings” also claim to be the messengers of Gods words.  Why would a perfect being like God allow “imperfect beings” to be his messengers?  God did not orate the Ten Commandments to today’s population, human beings did.  So the burden of proof is not on “God” it is on whomever is delivering the message.  And if that person is “imperfect” what motivation is there for anyone to believe what is being said other than fear?      A child may tell a friend something she wants the friend to tell another friend.  Adults know when you want to give someone an important message, and you don’t want any of the meaning to get lost in translation, you must deliver that message yourself.      Put on your armor, mount your steed, and let the intellectual jousting begin!

So I replied and he was like "Well I'm not obligated to say much more but it hurts us to have a reputation like that.  And you should try to look at more than the face of the earth, you'll find what you're looking for."  I was like "us? you're freaking me out dude."  and I'm waiting for him to reply.  But my question is, is this dude just bs-ing me, or are vampires really real?  **shudders**

20090309151915AANuHkr	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Do you believe many whites "think" they aren;t racist because black people refuse to say they are?	I believe so   You would be surprised at how many(majority of whites) white people have never been told they were racist, yet we live in a racist society, Any black person that says we don't isn't living in USA.   Many blacks are afraid, and say they ignore it, that is the problem. You don't ignore it, that only makes it worse, you fight it.

Some people have legitimate grievances, some people's questions can be answered pretty quickly and easily and then there is every now and then a person who rambles on forever and has no idea what they're talking about.      One guy has been calling and I don't know what he's talking about (he's really old), so I asked him to write a letter.  I got the letter and it doesn't make a lot of sense except I'm pretty sure that there's nothing going on that we're concerned with.  How do I tell him that 1. we are not concerned with his problem and 2. don't call me about it, but in a polite way?

20090309160740AAu4yy5	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What to do about an incompatible, needy, roommate who follows me like a lost dog?	About two months ago a close friend of mine had to turn down a potential roommate because she was being relocated for work. She knew I needed a roommate and suggested he and I should meet and maybe he could move in with me. I readily agreed and after meeting the guy, felt it was very unlikely that he'd move in, as he seemed uninterested in the space available.    The next day he called and asked how soon he could move in. I said as soon as he was ready, thinking it wouldn't be right away as he needed to get a job transfer first. He started moving in a week later. After he moved in I found out that not only had he not gotten a transfer, but his other roommates had kicked him out, his job had cut his hours, and it would be some time before he had any chance of being transferred. At first this didn't bother me though I thought it rather inconvenient for him.    However I've since realized why his old roommates kicked him out. He has no friends here and hasn't made any real attempts to make any. He constantly follows me and comments on absolutely everything I do, when I go out with my friends, he attempts to invite himself along. I've begun to feel like I like with a trapdoor spider, when I come home I try to be quiet lest he spring and begin questioning where I've been and what I've been doing. I felt bad at first because I understand he is lonely in a new town, but now I've realized that he does nothing to improve his situation. Also he says many offensive things. The reason I needed a roommate is that my last one commit suicide, this new roommate recently had a suicide in his family and commented that he was glad because the person had been a 'burden' due to having post traumatic stress disorder. This is only an example of the offensive things this guy says, but just about anytime he opens his mouth everyone in the vicinity gets wide eyed.    So now I'm unsure what to do.

20090309180615AAnQCKm	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Question for Protestant Christians regarding the Bible?	It's a known fact that the Catholic Church compiled the Bible (through the holy spirit) declaring which books were inspired by the holy spirit. You can further look into this but in summary it was done during the councils of Hippo in 393, Carthage in 397, and then it was sent to Rome for confirmation in 419      It can't be denied that the Catholic Church compiled the Bible. No it was not written by the Catholic Church (various writers) but it was officially compiled through the holy spirit by the Church.       Essentially, if a Protestant or non-Catholic Christian believes the Bible is completely and absolutely true (which it is) would a Protestant be accepting the teaching authority of the Catholic Church?      Even Martin Luther himself admits, "We are obliged to yield many things to the Papists (Catholics)--that they possess the Word ofGod which we received from them, otherwise we should have known nothing at all about it         So if you believe in the Bible wouldn't you therefore accept the authoritative Catholic Church?

20090309180547AA7Hxg8	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about this anti-abortion situation?  Where would you draw the line?	The Trinity of Asininity      Now that story's way off in "backwards Nepal", I hear some of you saying. "Nothing that uncivilized would ever happen in the modern world."      Well, how about this? In Brazil a young 9-year-old child who was repeatedly raped by her step-father from the age of six onwards recently became impregnated with twins.      What was the official Catholic Church line on this? Well, it was really quite simple: "Let her die". Literally.      You see, the doctors say her uterus simply isn't big enough to carry one baby, let alone two. She would most likely die if the fetuses were not aborted. This doesn't even involve the mental torture of forcing a child to give birth at age nine.      But the local archbishop was having none of it. He not only opposed the abortion, even in this life-saving case, he actually excommunicated the girl's mother and the doctors involved for going through with the operation.      Yes, excommunication for the girl's mother and her doctors—but not for the rapist. Rape, it seems, is not really a serious enough crime—though clearly an operation to save the life of the victim is.      This is almost as compassionate as the fundamentalist Muslims and their so-called "honor killing" response to the very same situation, though they'd, of course, actually get it over with much more quickly and deliberately.      Either way, from the mindless doctrinaire hard-line religious point of view, it's clear: The kid's gotta die.      Doctrine over common sense. Canon over compassion. Ideology over humanity. That's right, it's the Trinity of Asininity.      Seriously, can you imagine any of this ridiculous nonsense if it were men, rather than women, who menstruated and/or got pregnant (through rape or otherwise)? I think not.

I'm all for gay rights, and I know some gays who I'm fine with.      However, many people call me a homophobe simply because I don't like attention from males toward my body.

Apparently they now all consider me a homophobe.       Is that being homophobic? just because I don't like this kind of attention from men?

20090309170103AAaurYG	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What is marriage really based on?	Is it gender, or is it love?      What is your marriage based on? The fact that you are man and woman, or the fact that you love each other?      If it's based on love, why shouldn't homosexuals be able to get married rather than "join unions"?    If the Bible tells us to love and accept all, shouldn't that include homosexuals?   Shouldn't that include everyone who isn't exactly like you in every single shape and form?      You may say that homosexuality destroys society, but I think those who are intolerant destroy society.      Diversity makes life beautiful, don't you think?

20090309174837AAR7nJt	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	What is it that makes people so afraid of nudity?	There are so many people in North America who seem to go absolutely ballistic at the idea that anybody would be comfortable enough with their body to be naked in a social setting...why is that?      Are people being trained from childhood to feel ashamed of their body, that they need to hide it away?      I was, when I was younger, terribly uncomfortable with nudity because of exactly that reason. When I got older (16) I realized how totally ridiculous I had been acting all throughout my childhood.      But why do we insist on forcing this bizarre concept on every successive generation?

20090309175343AAbK1xi	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	My best friend is bi, am I reacting the wrong way?	I just found out today that my best guy friend is bisexual and that he has a boyfriend who I am also friends with. I love my friends to death and if they're happy being bisexual then that's fine with me. My best friend has been teased since elementary school that he was gay and he ignored it. I wasn't one of the people who constantly made fun of him about his " gayness ". He told me today that he came out of the closet 3 months ago. There's a bisexual fad that's going on and the problem is that I don't want my friend to be bi because of a fad. So what I'm wondering is if he's really bi or if he's just taking part of a fad and because everyone else is doing it. I care about him allot and I don't want him to get hurt.I don't want him to just be bi because everyone else is bi. If he was doing that, it would be sad because I wouldn't want his boyfriend to be hurt or him.      His boyfriend said that he's been bisexual since he was in 6th grade but just didn't tell anyone because he didn't want to receive a backlash. I doubt that he's taking part of the fad since he's been bi for like 4 years.

Thanks for any help with this one...      the thing is, much to my surprise, me and my best friend (who is also a girl) fell in love with eachother 7 years ago. We didn't expect this as we never had been with girls before hand, so it was a bit of a shock.      The thing is, she could never except the relationship in the open as she was scared of what people would say as her gay sister has been disowned by her family.      so after 5 years, she got engaged and moved in with a man. we carried on seeing eachother for a while but that stopped as she said that she didnt think her relationship would work with me around and she loved me but had to forget me to move on with this man,      I tried to move on too, and saw other people...but after a year of not seeing her, i still felt the same about her.      I had a phonecall in tears from her on Saturday...the first time in a year, and she was saying that she has slept on the sofa for the past year and she doesnt have sex with her fiance...and that she has tried to forget me but she can't.      She wont split with her fiance as she is too scared, but she is miserable and is making him miserable, and me.      I'm not sure what I can do is its breaking my heart as it doesnt make sense if two people love eachother but are not together....but she wont leave him as she said that he makes it look like she is straight...      Has anybody got any ideas?      thanks loads

My bathroom is dim with only a night light high up but when I walked in there I saw it in full flesh. It stood about 4 1/2ft from shoulder to ground a pitch black wolf with goldenish red eyes. I heard it growl and block out the night light. I was scared and only closed the door and walked away. I still feel it watching me. Is it good or bad? It hasn't given me any harm yet.

20090309131919AAvtLHF	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Got asked to leave gas station for coming in too many times...?	Weird.       My friend and I have nothing to do in our town, like all the other teenagers.      My friend and I visit the Sunoco station for gas regularly, or for coffee, food, candy, using the restroom, etc.        Sometimes we're there for up to 45 minutes or so after doing what we came for.       We don't cause any trouble (not blasting music, shouting or anything, just sitting quietly in the car).      We've done this regularly for almost 6 months now.      Last night, we were there 3 times:       First, I went in for a soda, and we sat in the car as I drank it and talked (its not as if we sit staring in at the clerk or anything, we barely even notice they're there).      Second (2 hours later), my friend needed to use the bathroom. We sat and talked again before leaving (like I said, we have nothing to do in our town).      Third, (also at least an hour later) we came because we saw someone we knew in the station and pulled in to say hi (we parked in different spaces every time).      During this third visit, another customer (coincidentally someone we knew) and his dad walked over to my car and said the clerk inside wanted us to leave, because she had "seen us 5 times, had called her boss about it, and was going to call the cops if we didn't leave."      Okay, WHAT?      We're just 2 girls her age, not like 5 big guys looking like they're gonna rob the place.       Other kids do the SAME EXACT THING.       I guess maybe she might notice us being there more because I drive a very particular looking car (Mustang), but still.       It's not like we came in once, came back 6 minutes later and didn't get anything, came back 20 minutes later, etc. THAT would be unreasonable.       Why couldn't she say it herself like a company employee should, and just run over and say "Hi, if you guys aren't getting anything would you mind going?" Simple as that.      I know this isnt really a question, I just want to know I'm not crazy and get other opinions on this (I'm seriously disturbed by it for some reason).

20090309175131AAt81yP	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	I escaped death, but I feel like I shouldn't have.?	Since I was 14, I've had 2 wishes. Either be happy, or die without killing myself. I thought of different ways I could die, like getting shot randomly or being hit by a car. Yesterday, I was driving on a 4 lane freeway when it was raining really hard. I was in the left lane, and started spinning out of control at 70 mph. I just missed the car right next to me, and I did a 540 crossover to the right lane (now facing oncoming traffic), and I crashed right into the guardrail (on the driver's side), and then the car bounced off and did a 360 crossover back to the left until I crashed into the ditch next to the shoulder. I wasn't wearing a seat belt, I was wearing my sunglasses even though it was dark, and when I hit the guardrail, my entire body smashed into the door (since no seat belt was used). My head hit the window pretty hard, my side was bruised, and my neck was hurting. A cop found me 10 minutes later sitting in the smokey car smoking a cigarette, and not even calling my parents or 911. The car is totaled, and the cop said there is no reason I should still be alive, and that the guardrail was weak and should have snapped, sending me off onto a lower road. I am perfectly fine. No scratches, no cuts, no broken bones, no concussion, no nothing asides from a little neck pain and a little bruise. All I could think about before I hit the rail was my best friend whom I'm in love with. Since happiness isn't something that I've really seen in the past 4 1/2 years, I can't help but feel that there was a mistake. I do believe in God, but I feel like I should not have left that accident unharmed. I feel as if I should have died, because I have seen that happening to myself hundreds of times, finally ending everything. Most people find a new found meaning of life, but I feel no different. I've always tried to hide depression from everyone, so no one has ever really thought that there was anything wrong with me. And since it's never been diagnosed, I can't help but feel that there's just something wrong with me asides from depression. Has anyone else just wanted to die without killing themselves?
20090309175212AAESBR7	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fall in love with a LDS missionary,what should i do?	I just been in Canada for about half a year, and I am a girl from HongKong. One day I met some missionaries in a Momom church. They're all very kind to me and I really aprreciate them for their kindness and i never met such friendly people even in China.I thought I fell in love with a missionary who is the same age as me.I don't know what to do now. At firstI just want to do some pray in the church, i never thought i will fall in love the missionary there. I know they are not allowed to date during the mission. That makes me feel a little pain in my mind.What should I do? Shall I just leave and never come back to this Church or I should wait after his mission end and told him what i feel to him?   Sorry for my poor English , i hope you'll understand what i say and i do really hope you could give some advices to me. And i'll also pray to the Lord and ask him.   Some people say:missionaries have the spirit of the Lord with them and that is what alot of people fall in love with.    I think so.
20090309175206AAhAanW	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Jews: What would this be considered inappropriate?	I know that in Judaism all one has to do is follow the noahide laws, if you're a gentile, but I really want to convert.      However, the nearest synagogue is half an hour away, and my family doesn't own a car. I do want to move someday, and I've been looking at synagogues when I consider where to go, but with the economy the way it is (I JUST got internet back) it'll be awhile.      Would it be considered inappropriate to try and keep as many of the laws as possible by myself? One of my Christian friends said that's what Messianics do, and trying to follow it without being Jewish or actively converting would make a mockery of it.      (I thought Messianics worshipping Jesus in the Jewish festivals and shanghaiing the holidays and language was what offended more than anything else?)

20090309181913AAZyUO4	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	So what punishment did Hamza get for getting drunk and mutilating camels?	"...And Hamza b. 'Abd al-Muttalib was busy in drinking in that house in the company of a singing girl who was singing to him. She said: Hamza, get up for slaughtering the fat she-camels. Hamza attacked them with the sword and cut off their humps and ripped their haunches, and then took out their livers. I said to Ibn Shihab: Did he take out anything from the hump? He said: He cut off the humps altogether. Ibn Shihab reported 'Ali having said: I saw this (horrible) sight and it shocked me, and I came to Allah's Apostle (may peace be upon him) and there was Zaid b, Haritha with him and communicated to him this news. He came in the company of Zaid and I also went along with him and he went to Hamza and he expressed anger with him. Hamza raised his eyes and said: Are you (not) but the servants of my father? Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) turned back on his heels (on hearing this) until he went away from them."   (From Sahih Muslim, Book 023, Number 4879)      "...Hamza has committed aggression to my she-camels, and has cut off their humps. and ripped their haunches, and he is in a house in the company of some drunkards. (Hearing this) Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) sent for his mantle and, putting it on him, he proceeded, and I and Zaid b. Haritha followed him, until he came to the door (of the house) in which there was Hamza. He (the Holy Prophet) sought permission which they granted him. and they were all drunk. Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) began to reprimand Hamza for what he had done. Hamza's eyes were red. He cast a glance at Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) and then looked towards his knees. and then lifted his eyes and cast a glance at his waist and then lifted his eyes and saw his face. And then Hamza said: Are you anything but the slaves of my father?..."   (From Sahih Muslim, Book 023, Number 4881)

20090309182023AA77sVC	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is modern science used by some people as a modern religion?	Note that I am not asking if modern science is a religion, but whether it is used by people as a religion.  Atheists are so true when they say that one adheres to a religion  because it provides hope or because one fears the unknown.  It is this fear of the unknown and the need to believe in our hopes that make us biased and irrational.  Isn't it a bit naive to think that the same irrational attitude cannot be created using modern science as a way to remove our fears and to nourish our hopes?   I am not saying anything against modern science. This is only about how it can be used by people.        One characteristic of a religious attitude is that you feel there is no need to rely on other sources of information.   I am not trying to defend religions as a whole, but those who remember my previous questions, know that I am a proponent of the great value of meditations which come from these old traditions.  A religious attitude toward science and against these old traditions would be to reject the specific meditations that come from these old traditions and try to adopt a meditation that would be described in some free book or scientific paper, etc.  An even more religious attitude would be to reject meditation as a whole, but it is more likely that one would be open to meditation in general, but insist that it should not be taught by an independent organization, even a secular one, because it becomes like a religion. In fact, many religions are only based on meditation, not on a belief in God.  So, a fear of the unknown can make us reject these organizations. A religious attitude, a fear of the unknown,  would make us want that meditation is taught  in books or web sites, but studies show that these meditations aren't better than the placebo effect. This is not so surprising because there aren't professionally trained teachers behind these techniques.        I cannot insist enough that this is not at all against modern science. To the contrary,  do a search on Google Scholar on meditation. Do not use a general search engine because you will get all kinds of weird web sites with no scientific values.  You will see that modern science totally supports the value of meditation and, moreover,  you will see that the most studied and effective meditations are linked to old traditions of knowledge, which are classified as religions.

I don't, and I will give you my argument first before everyone starts calling me a racist.        We know that on the outside, the genetic differences include things like eyes, skin colour, hair colour, and height.      But scientists have discovered a few other things as well.  For example, african americans do great in running events in the olympics because they have an increased lung capacity compared to those of other races.  They also have a different muscle composure (more fast twitch muscle fibers) than most, probably from thousands of years of hunting and gathering in Africa which has made their genes evolve this way.      Scientists also know that certain races are susceptible to certain diseases like diabetes or heart disease.      Is it not fair to assume that mentally, the brain has taken a different genetic form as well, with certain neural passageways being used differently than others?

What is your opinion on this?

20090309181632AAmdpTU	Society & Culture;Languages	Studying ASL Grammar?	Hi,   I'm an ASL student and I'm finding it strange and frustrating that I can't seem to find any thorough resources on the grammar and structure of the language.  My program only has a single course in it and only half of it is on basic grammar.  Doesn't ASL have a full grammatical system that needs to be studied in order to communicate correctly?  If I look on line for 'German Grammar' for example, I'll have about 20 options.  But for ASL I saw only 2 on the linguistics of it.  Nothing I could get a whole lot of practice out of.   Please recommend any books or website you know of that could provide this information for me.  Thank you! :)
