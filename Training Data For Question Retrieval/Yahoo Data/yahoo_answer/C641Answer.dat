Z0lbrnHpaa	It does sound like you were used. You mentioned it once and their actions showed that they don't take your feelings into consideration. I would say just leave it alone for now but if they ever want to stay at your house again, tell them that you will not be offering your home as a place for them to stay. Friends should be more considerate and aware of what they're doing.
RvddYKqjaa	Forget the prank. It's a childish response. Learn to cope with the apples of the world. There are plenty of them. Use her to teach you patience, and the ability to walk away.|`|zxQT3Uo5aa	Don't be mean, just ignore her|`|Ezf2Oq8vaa	well in this casee ou can be at first to school and tie a sting and invisable one attach it to anywhere she would walk so she can trip in front of anybody LOL .i dont know or tell afootball player to tackle hre and dump her into the trrash can for qa senior prank or uhmm put a bunch of trash on her desk and gum when she sits down that is if you have her for any classes LOL UNNO! THINK(:|`|hYRP0x2Eaa	lol @ the apple thing.<br>  <br>  What kind of a prank? My friends played a prank on this girl once, I thought it was completely hurtful, but it got the job done. It's pretty simple and immature. You write a love note to the girl pretending to be some guy in the school who likes her. You keep it going, giving her letters every week. And see if she buys it. Then send her a final letter saying "I change my mind, I don't like you. Why would anyone like an ugly ***** like you? hahaha I was dared to send you those letters!" Anyway, you get my point. If there are no cameras in your school then you won't get caught. But really think hard about this...is it worth hurting her that much for a quick laugh? Good Luck in your choice. xoxo|`|R760STfwaa	pranks will only get you in trouble. dont even think about it|`|rJcYPuCZaa	jszt leave it alone.|`|VygBNA0Waa	tell her to hold her tounge and say <br>  i was born on a pirate ship|`|87e42b12d9375f23a7f6007b19387ae4aa	pants her in the middle of class. classic.|`|1PqbJzsnaa	i don't know...put gum in her hair or something.|`|iU4Q2GOdaa	ahaha..... apple.<br>  <br>  tell everyone she has lice. or that she pooped herself. you saw it.<br>  <br>  or tell a boy that she likes him. or trip her in the playground.|`|89b7405201feaf6d3fdb7bfe0c1d09a9aa	haha I never tried that holding your tongue thing before.

Then say you are so sorry and act like it was a total accident. Grab some napkins and smear the food into her clothes so it stains permanently.

Have fun!|`|0fygxRHLaa	an apple?|`|eUn1U8j9aa	Don't prank her just because she's annoying you, you'll look like the immature one in the end. Ignore her, mind your own business. And if you really want to do something first just tell her nicely, if she still does it tell her off. But my best advice is to ignore her. Telling her off could lead to more problems, and doing a prank on her would just be worse.|`|Lb6Y7xlnaa	well. first you could tell her to just stay out of your face.. <br>  say: Look, i would appreciate it if you would leave me alone. I have done nothing to you and I would expect you to have the same respect for me.<br>  <br>  if that doesn't work, let your teacher know in private<br>  <br>  Or when she is not looking, trip her behind up one good time in a slick way..|`|376Tj61Naa	what the hell is an apple?|`|n6kmwy4gaa	well i dont think pulling a prank is da answer because either way you'll end up getting in trouble but if you really want to when the girl is wearing white pants you could "accidentally" spill ketchup on her pants and it'll make her look like she has her period. but id recomend not to|`|S4sb5FgBaa	You didn't say what she did how old you are.

kTZ9im5Taa	i would just let them know that you need your eyes check....your parents have to understand and cant have you going through the rest of your school years not being able to see. then whats going to happen when you get your license?  i wear glasses sometimes, but mostly contact!!  there is nothing wrong with glasses, as a matter of fact, there are some really cute glasses!! you just have to get a pair that fit your face!  *******best of luck to you*********|`|ENGwbEycaa	you say... i need glasses...|`|6pT6Hd4zaa	You could say "Since everyone else is near sighted, would it be worth me getting my eyes checked as there;s quite a high chance i might be?" And surely a squint is less pretty than glasses :p<br>  My parents are both averagely near sighted, my eyesight is worse than theirs combined, and my brother has 20:20 vision! I've had glasses since I was 8 but switched to contacts when I was about 13. Depending on how old you are, contacts should be fine for you, and they're not noticeable at all! Hope that helps!x|`|DYkrHRs9aa	You should tell them You can get contact lenses.
Z0lbrnHpaa	That does sound a little gay but based on how old you guys are, it could just be an experimental age. I would say don't tell your mom...just don't put yourself in that situation anymore. Be honest with your friends and tell them that you're not comfortable with it.|`|H7LnOSGGaa	in my opinion i think it is kind of weird just for guys to be in a room together masturbating period. if it feels wrong to be watching them or even be in the same room while they are doing those things, then why are you there? i do think its kind of awkward but whatever floats your boat. i guess.  to answer your question i think what the guys are doing is gay. and i think you know that since you say you feel uncomfortable.|`|fEP9aYiOaa	I think that if you feel uncomfortable, you should get out of the situation.

UAF8Zxzaaa	You should probably just ignore it. From what I have found, a lot of people on Xbox Live are extreeeeemely immature. So they'll tease or fight about just about anything. Just don't talk about it when they mention it, shrug it off. Basically don't feed the fight. Even if you were using a voice changer, why would it matter? Or just stop playing with the friends of your friends, if possible. Or just play without talking. There's probably some way around it.|`|VP7KAe12aa	You shouldn't get upset about it because you know the truth your friends friends' are trying to piss you off and they are doing a good job about it.<br>  Talk to your friend telling them of what they're friends are doing to you over Xbox Live.

KPXwwwMMaa	How dare you cut yourself just to control what your friend does!! Don't you see that's controlling and manipulative?!<br>  <br>  When you are in a romance, you focus more on your significant 'other' than anyone else. Ultimately, you get married, and that's the way it's SUPPOSED to be. 'Best Friends' aren't supposed to last forever. You can be 'friends' forever, but forcing someone to be friends with only you is wrong.<br>  <br>  You need some help. Cutting is very bad. Go find a counselor to talk through some of your feelings. There's no shame in that.

AA12398373	Oh Kate!<br>  You are carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders, and you don't deserve to do that, and you certainly don't need it.<br>  <br>  Here's the thing!<br>  All of that stuff you told us in your question isn't happening directly to you. Sure it's happening all around you, and mostly to people you really love and care about. But show me how all of the worrying you are doing about it has helped any of your family, and loved ones.<br>  <br>  1) You have to move out of your house? Well that's not good, but you didn't cause that to happen. It's not your fault. Your parents are responsible for putting a roof over your head, so leave the worry about that to them. Things might change for you during this time, but I am sure your parents will sort it all out so that you will remain safe, warm and dry.<br>  2) Your older sis is sneaking out of the house? Well she can't MAKE you cover for her if you don't want to. You have enough turmoil to deal with in your life without having to manage her BS. Tell her to find another sucker.<br>  3) Uncle attempted suicide? Well again you didn't cause that, it wasn't your fault. It happened a few month's ago. What is past is in the past. You can't change it, so stop taking it on as if you can.<br>  4) About your brother. I don't know which is a more sad situation. His turning his back on his family, or his upcomming deployment to Iraq. I sympathise with you and I am sorry that this is going on. But you can't control your brother and his choices.<br>  <br>  It's natural, and understandable that you are feeling stuck in the middle. Especially since all of this stuff is not of your doing. It's not fair,but you are being even more unfair to yourself by trying to take responsibility for what is going on.<br>  <br>  I think it would help you a lot if you could find an adult who you really trust to talk through some of this. <br>  You described a lot of heavy issues, and it can be quite a burden to carry on your own.|`|3dMfkdxpaa	A fair part of your problem is that you are taking too much of this on board. There isnt much that you as a teen can do about this other than to help your parents by making this as easy a process as you can. Bad things sometimes happen to good people . It is just life. It is what makes us stronger and where character comes from.<br>  Take it easy. This is just a life hurdle. Everything will turn out for the best. Make the best of where it goes. Good lUck|`|VygBNA0Waa	don't cover for your sister no more <br>  you cant help your uncle <br>  write letters to your brother when he goes he probably feels guilty because he is going away and cant help use so that's why he is angry and pretends he doesn't care <br>  be nice to your mum she is scared about the future of where to live and what to do<br>  your mum would be scared of dieing have patience with her<br>  karma is true you are going through all the crap now so then later on you will have the perfect life later <br>  good luck|`|zUdxoRbyaa	14 year old girl? wow, you do have a lot on your plate. try your best to hold on to your sanity. besides, how much worse can it get?|`|0056ba0f2ca4852a4f7b389766f314d4aa	It's happening to the people around you, not you. Your parents lost the house; I'm sure they're devastated. Your mother has to deal with cancer and the treatments. You do not have to cover for your sister; you're opting to do so and put yourself in that situation. Your uncle must be severely depressed and have no one to turn to in order to think suicide is the answer. Your brother is facing a huge task in being deployed and pulling away from the family may be the only way he knows to deal with it. So what exactly is happening to you, other than the house, which affects others besides you. Maybe you should be focusing on helping these people instead of how their traumas affects you.

In fact I'd rather have my own bed. <br>  <br>  It will probably hurt your husband's feelings to tell him the truth, but it's either that or spend the rest of your life making your husband happy so he can sleep the way he wants, even if that means you have to be uncomfortable and do without the sleep you need. <br>  <br>  I think it's always better to be honest. I'm sure if the situation was turned around, your husband wouldn't go night after night not getting any sleep because you needed to wrap your self around him and prevent him from being able to get comfortable and sleep. <br>  <br>  Just tell him.

Did something happen to you before you met your husband that made you want to pull away?  If he makes you uncomfortable do you also feel "un-safe" around him when you guys are sleeping?<br>  <br>  This is probably something you need to talk to him about, or better yet, see if you can maybe talk to a therapist about a little.  If there are no underlying problems from the past, maybe you just need ... space... <br>  <br>  In which case, you definitely have to talk to him about it.  I'm not saying hurt his feelings, but you have to let him know what he is doing is costing you sleep.<br>  <br>  UPDATE: What Sounds Painful said, sounds actually like pretty good advice.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	I had to have this talk with my husband, too.  <br>  <br>  I can't stand it if anything is touching me while I sleep.  I get overheated, upset, I feel smothered, and if his hand is on my leg, it makes my leg start twitching, and I'm awake all night long.  I started sleeping on the floor in the living room, just so that I could get some sleep.<br>  <br>  Then I talked to him about it.  I told him, "Honey, I love you, but you know I can't sleep if anything is touching me.  It's not you - I've ALWAYS been this way about sleeping.  So when we go to bed at night, let's snuggle and have our loving timeon THIS side of the bed, and when you fall asleep, I am going to roll over to the OTHER side of the bed."<br>  <br>  It has worked out wonderfully.  Sometimes I still have to ask him to roll over in the middle of the night, but he didn't get offended, and now we BOTH get a good night's sleep.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Don't let these people tell you that you are ungrateful or weird.  We all have things that we need to help us fall asleep.  Some people listen to music, some need complete darkness, some people need space.|`|mcUSz16kaa	He loves you dearly and you are very lucky to receive this kind of affection. He is very very attached to you.  <br>  <br>  Here are my suggestions:<br>  <br>  He needs to know your situation and that it bothers you, or you will never get a restful sleep. Face him on your side and tell him that you love him, and tell him that you don't want to hurt his feelings, but you can't get any sleep with him holding your hands and with his arms wrapped around you. Tell him that your body needs it's own space to breathe, and it needs to stretch out for a good nights rest. Let him know that your body will be all prepared and ready for the next day with him. He should understand and respect your wishes with no hurt feelings.   <br>  <br>  As soon as he is well into his sleep, move away slowly so you can have your own space. If he wakes up, just tell him that you love him, but you can't get any sleep with his arms and hands inner twined with your body. "Honey/Babe..I really love you and love your caresses when we sleep, but I'm finding that I'm not getting sleep like I used to have". He will ask why..then you tell him why. He should understand and respect your wishes with no hurt feelings. With his understanding, you should be able to discuss your problem without any drama.  <br>  <br>  Discuss the situtation and find a solution to solve your problem. Perhaps another sleep position that you both can agree upon. Have him spoon with you and have him place his hands on your thighs so they are least touching you, then move away slowly when he is asleep. <br>  <br>  Go out and buy a super soft cute cuddly teddy bear.  After moving away from him, slowly replace yourself with this soft cuddly teddy bear so he has something to cuddle with. Tell him your problems when you are sliding in that teddy bear and to not take it as an insult.  He should find this very relaxing and satisfying since he is a cuddler. With this in mind, it should bring back child hood memories when he was young, and he should consider this as being playful.<br>  <br>  Does he have a sister or mother that you can tell that you can confide with and you are close with? The next time you see them and if they ask you how are things? Tell them your problem.  They can hint the message back to him so he will at least knows that he is preventing you from getting a good nights sleep . This will at least break your problem in an indirect way if you can't tell him directly.  You might be surprised if he changes his habits and then you can discuss the matter in bed if he brings it up.<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to do, I wouldn't sleep in another room. Sleeping in another room unless you are sick will surely hurt his feelings.  Your bed is big enough for you to have your own space. <br>  <br>  Anyway, I wish you a good nights sleep and good luck!|`|CaWf475jaa	Honestly I want to be cuddled while asleep which my husband seldom do.  I guess putting a pillow between you.  Or better yet tell him that you want space while sleeping.  Since you have been married a long time a suppose by this time you can talk about this things already without hurting each others feeling.  you may not be the cuddly type person in bed but perhaps show him your affection in other ways.  be extra sweet during your love making or even during the day.|`|AA10088887	Very often this kind of feeling is a result of some incident. As he is your husband and you have had time to accustom yourself to his habits I am surprised that you are complaining about it now. Please ask yourself what could be the reason for this sudden desire in you to distance from him and try to solve that problem. It is also possible that he has some kind of insecurity. Try to find the cause and solve it. This is just the consequence.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	You are something else.  Most women would love to have a man that didn't turn his back on them and act like he is in the bed alone.  All you can do is tell him.  It is going to hurt his feelings but remember this What ever you don't want to do another woman will.  That includes letting your husband sleep up under her at night while you sleep in your big bed alone with all the space you need.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Try starting out the night way over on his side of the bed.  After he passes out, slip away and go back over to your side of the bed.|`|MPNvGc5Xaa	I'm awake right now because my husband is lying next to me snoring like there is no tomorrow.  When I nudge him he stops for a second but only a second. It's weird because he has always snored but lately it's been getting on my nerves more that usual, must be something in the air. sometimes its kinda funny because he wakes hiself up, then he looks at me like I did something. but anyway about your problem, just let him hold you until he goes to sleep if you can handle it, then slip away after he goes to sleep.  Thats what I do when my husband gets all feely touchy.
AA10277818	You won't be pushing him away. Let me rephrase it, you can't. He will either choose to be with you or otherwise.<br>  <br>  I've been in a similar situation once but worse (similar to his).<br>  <br>  1st: Let be clear about your baby: Make a decision and NEVER EVER regret about your decision. Your decision is neither right or wrong. It's the correct decision to make at the time based on the info you have and how you feel.<br>  <br>  2nd: Hormone surge will make you oversensitive, just take a deep breath, drink a glass of water when you feel like you are going to burst something out. Once spoken, you can't take those words back.<br>  <br>  Now about how he feel for you.<br>  <br>  Sounded like he care and have feeling for you, but not in love with you. Don't confuse "being in love" with "love". Those 2 are totally different feeling.<br>  <br>  Men, more than women, love the chase (e.g. hard to get part). If you really wanted him to look at you like when you guys 1st met, you have to balance thing out:<br>  <br>     * don't be available to him all the time, spend more time with your friends and family (sound like you need them).<br>  <br>     * let him know that you don't like what he did (the earlier prank) and why you don't like it (he betrayed your love & trust). <br>  <br>  If you need more help, just IM me. I was like him once.

When  you say they are gone, has the person left  you and is not coming back or just gone like to the military or to school?<br>  <br>  Those are different.  <br>  <br>  If a person I met and loved left me then I'd probably feel bad and would miss them but might also have a lot of betrayal and might wish I had never met them.<br>  <br>  But if it is short time and they will be back,, then no, i'd not wish we had never met.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes even with someone who hurt us, I can't wish I'd never met as there might be some good that came from it. I was married 25 years and husband left.  I was devastated.  But I didn't wish I never met him as I had 2  kids an couldn't wish them away.  But other than that, I wish I'd not gotten involved with him even though we at least 15 good years.  I missed  him. My sister said I didn't but i missed what I wanted him to be. He wasn't there much for me as he worked a lot.  Went off with an employee.<br>  <br>  Is it better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all?   <br>  <br>  I  hope that the person you cared about is gone for a short time and will be back.<br>  <br>  If he died, then no, I don't think you should feel it better to never have met him - so long as he was good to you - even though you miss him.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|Ii5udGmJaa	Yes , I have thought that , but it is better to have loved and lost then to never have loved at all. Reason being is that By loving and losing some one helps us grow , in maturity in relationships and in life. Granted it is very hard how ever it is well worth it. It teaches us how to cope with things that is beyond our comprehension. This helps us to grow and to help others out who is often experiencing the same thing as us.<br>  they will be eternally grateful to you for this knowledge and help that you provide. <br>  well thats my 2 bits , hope that it helps|`|VCz1CtiLaa	Yeah I wished that over my ex.

3vWpUXsmaa	First of all, let me offer my condolences to you and your family. Death of a loved one is never easy.<br>  <br>   I lost my brother the day after Christmas 2005 and there is not a day that goes by that I don't think of him. Whether it be something random that reminds me of him or my mother bringing him up. I think it's even tougher when it's so sudden. <br>  <br>  Although I can't really offer you any advice time WILL heal your wounds and relying on family and friends will help you get through the toughest parts. Just don't try to do it all on your own and make sure that if you need to talk about it you do. Sometimes just telling someone how you feel helps immensely.|`|YXgVGjHlaa	First of all, I am offering sympathy.  I am truly sorry that you lost your dad.  I did also lose my father 14 years ago.  I would not call him back now because I know he went to a better place to spend eternity.  It surely was hard for awhile because we missed him so much.  It does take time to fill the void left by losing a parent and in your case a best friend.  You can find things and people to help fill that void.  I hope you will be married one day to someone you love very much.  That helps so much to have a spouse to share your life with.  <br>  <br>    It is difficult to think about those who don't love their parents and have so little respect to make it public as to how they hate them.  That is very sad but you know all kinds of people are on this q/a forum.|`|oS6qvprNaa	think about all the good times you had with your dad and cherish them also he will always be with you in your heart and soul he will always be near you think about positive things be happy|`|BU0jrxx1aa	I am not sure if you are religious but just because he left this earth doesn't mean that he is not still there with you right now. You just have to know that he is in a better place looking down at you right now just wishing that he could tell you to stop crying that he is fine and he will see you again in just a matter of time. Just ask your self this do you think that he wants you to be upset or do you think he wanted you sitting drinking enough beer for you and him watching the race. But just remember brother you are never alone you can always talk god!!<br>  Hope this helps and god bless!|`|VygBNA0Waa	its really hard i know i lost my dad 7half years ago and it took me a good 3yrs not to be sad everyday when you think about them but now when i think about my dad i smile he was a great man and friend as well <br>  maybe start going out meeting people start working on another car that he always talked about <br>  i feel for you <br>  good luck with you future <br>  each day does get better
y9N3DsKBaa	Well you could be right about those women. I would never marry anyone who thought like them.|`|eff21d66c171033c319f0d8b3f48518baa	I would like to save myself for marriage.<br>  <br>  I'm a pretty open-minded person, I'm somewhat "religious".<br>  But I think men are great (Even though I've known quite a few assholes). Yeah, certain men just want to get laid, but same with women. Not all men want just sex, some men want a meaningful relationship.<br>  <br>  Some men take advantage of women, but again, some women do the same to men. But not ALL men are like that.<br>  <br>  Saving yourself for marriage can be a great thing.<br>  <br>  You'll get to share your love with the person you're sharing the rest of your life with. You'll get to experience many new and exciting things with that person. Making love for the first time can seem a little more special, because you waited specially for THAT person whom you are married to.<br>  <br>  Some women can be critical of men. But I don't know why. Every man is different. You shouldn't be critical again the whole gender, just because there are a few bad ones out there. There are also some really fantastic ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Danny

It's a "power" thing ... she doesn't have anyone else at the moment, and she's decided that YOU are "not good enough" ... BUT ... she wants you to want her so she can feel good temporarily.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and "cut her off."  In fact, if you feel up to it ... treat her like SHYT.  Stupid girls like that LOVE that kind of stuff ... THEN she might want you ... and YOU can then reject HER.  Classic "turn-the-tables" move.|`|J3JClsuQaa	It sounds like this girly may be young and most def does not know what she wants.  My advice would be to move on... keep an open mind.  In the meantime, maybe play a little hard to get yourself.  If she texts ya, just send her one word answers.  If ya see her at anotha party, be civil, but not hangin all over her... Girls tend to want guys that don't want them, especially younger ones...|`|IdzVIBnRaa	may be she isn't really playing hard to get but i guess she doesn't dislike u either<br>  <br>  i think she is one those shy type girls who really facinate having a bf but are rreally scared to have one <br>  <br>  maybe she is scared that her friends or her parents wont accept the relationship<br>  <br>  maybe u should just talk to her and ask her indirectly whats her feelings for you.........|`|pANxH13Aaa	You should be her friend and if you can't do that move on.

c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	You need some time away from your family you fought with. Try to locate a family member or friend and spend some days with them. Once you are able to collect your thoughts write an apology letter to your family and explain how you feel about yourself, including other issues that's important to you.and then ask for their understanding and how they can help you. I know you are upset now but I want you to make the peace with your family. It takes a young adult like yourself to be mature and make the peace, but you need sometime alone first. You ask what you should do? I've given you the best advice. I will pray for you, promise. God bless.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	okay as a 39 year old woman, mother and nurse...

You're on the verge of being a man and there are all sorts of things going on in your body including, yes, hormones. Having said that, YOU are in charge of how you deal with your feelings - no one else. A great way to vent your anger and frustations is to write it down. Pretend it's a letter you're going to send your grandma or your mom or whoever you're angry with, but DON'T send it. Just getting out how you feel down onto paper will give you a sense of relief and control. You can also write down your goals on a sheet of paper. Make sure to make lists of all of the small steps you need to take to reach a certain goal. For example, if your goal is to lose weight, you could start out with something like "no chips today," or "walk around the block 3 times a day this week." Just taking small steps will help you to feel in control and will help your goal not seem to unattainable. People tend to give up when their goals seem so large and far away. If you're worried about your anger issues, it is also a good idea to talk to a counselor or be evaluated for depression. Good luck to you,hon! You'll get through this difficult period of life and remember it with a cringe when you're my age (36).|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	talk with your school counselor or another adult you trust and respect.<br>  <br>  sometimes we have emotional issues which have been left unattended, and things get out of control... sometimes we don't even know what the problem is, but there is one, nonetheless.<br>  <br>  it never hurt anyone to talk with a therapist for direction and self-enlightenment.
1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	False.  To listen to anybody outside of the relationship whatsoever is counterproductive and ill advised.  You are an adult old enough to maintain a relationship.  I don't care if it's your parents or your children nobody should have a hand in your own relationship able to give advice whatsoever.  Miss things?  Like hell...they shouldn't know if you're missing things because they aren't around or privy to information of a delicate and intimate nature.  If you aren't able to guide and control your own relationship with your partner you simply shouldn't be in that relationship.  Right or wrong if you can't control your own fate you are ill suited to live your life as a capable adult.|`|5jMNBO2naa	agree<br>  most people ignore red flags<br>  it's only after the break up or divorce do you see they were correct on hind sight|`|2P2K0rl2aa	Definitely true.|`|p8RvGtNYaa	Love is blind and all objectives lost.

It's only natural to think about what we did to them, or they did to us, to ruin what we had. Sometimes, the "blinders" are thick, and we're too caught up in trying to please our partner to realize what's going on.<br>  <br>  I do believe(and Im sure Im in the minority thinking this way), that EVERYONE, regardless of what's happened between them in the past, has a chance to reconnect with someone from their past. Im not talking about a current bf/gf/hubby/wife who has **** on you. But, someone who you or I might have dated in the past, and we 'all of a sudden" like them again? basically, we start remembering them, and the good times we did share together.<br>  <br>  Friends can be great to have as "wingmen", to possibly reunite a lost love. But, they can also be a hinderance @ times too, because they like to gossip, and they always put the blame on someone else, and not what you or I might have done to contribute to the breakup.<br>  <br>  I've seen alot of "friends" get old flames reunited, and they've worked out great, and not so great.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	I think this statement is true. People see what they want to see, especially when strong emotions are involved. For instance, a lot of women will see signs of cheating from their spouses, but they choose to ignore it because they convince themselves that their just paranoid. It's not something we can really help, it's a subconscious thing. If there's something there that we don't want to believe is there, we try to make any excuse to prove that it's not there.

How can he expect you to even want to be in the same bed with him if he is not clean, let alone touch his privates! lol. Honestly, I would be quite angry if my boyfriend didn't shower, because it would mean the sheets that I personally have to wash and hang out would get dirty quicker, plus I want my nightly cuddle, and I dont want the cuddle from a dirty boy. <br>  Occasionally my bf gets a little lazy with showering, but never more than 1 or 2 nights at the most.

AA10065812	???<br>  No, but if custody is the primary issue, demand Joint Physical Custody of them.<br>  <br>  Bird Nest Custody<br>  <br>  It’s a form of access or custody where the children stay in the former family residence and it is the parents who rotate in and out separately and on a negotiated schedule.<br>  <br>  The children simply live at "home" and the separated or divorced parents take turns living with them there, but never at the same time.<br>  <br>  The core element of this arrangement is that each parent maintains a separate residence where they live when it is not their turn at the "bird's nest". When one parent arrives for his/her designated time, the other vacates right away, so as to minimize or eliminate the presence of both at the same time.<br>  <br>  At times, bird's nest access can be coupled with specified access with the other parent say, for example, for dinner one night a week.<br>  <br>  Sometimes, this form of access or custody will end when the youngest child reaches the age of majority at which time, one parent either buys the other out of their interest, if any, in the former family residence, or it is sold and the proceeds divided pursuant to the matrimonial property regime or separation agreement.<br>  <br>  The arrangement can be expensive as it generally requires that three separate residences be maintained, the "nest" and a separate residence for each parent.<br>  <br>  The concept is somewhat novel and appears to have as its origin a Virginia case Lamont v Lamont.<br>  In Canada, Greenough v Greenough was a ground-breaker case in that the Court implemented a bird's nest custody order even though it had not been asked for by either party. Justice Quinn, in Greenough stated:<br>  <br>  "In Lamont ... the court made a bird’s nest custody arrangement in which the children (aged 3 and 5 years) remained in the home, with the mother staying in the home during the week and the father on the weekend. I think that the benefits of a bird’s nest order are best achieved where the children are able to stay in the matrimonial home, particularly if it has been the only residence that they have known....<br>  <br>  "Time and time again I have seen cases (and this is one) where the children are being treated as Frisbees. In general, parents do not seem to appreciate the gross disruption to which children are subjected where one of the parents has frequent access. In this regard, I do not believe there must be evidence that the children are suffering before the court is free to act. To me, it is a matter of common sense. At the risk of falling prey to simplistic generalities, I am of the view that, given a choice, I do not see why anyone would select a living arrangement which involved so much movement from house to house."|`|nZXJrAAjaa	Make sure your parents know that you love and respect both of them. Therefore you won't be taking sides in the matter. Let them know you are very willing to discuss things with them, but they can't use you to discuss matters for them instead of interacting with each other. This is simply too much of a burden for a child to have to take on. If either one of your parents takes the opportunity to talk badly about the absent parent, stop them in their tracks.<br>  <br>  They need to realize you love both of them equally and you are uncomfortable with such discussions.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	If you express to them - in a loving way - that you would like for them to settle the disagreemnet, it might help them to SEE that they are dragging their CHILD through the mud, too.  Sometimes parents need to be reminded.  Be kind to them, and just ask if there is any hope of seeing an agreement soon.<br>  <br>  I don't think that you should get involved in their divorce.  I don't think you should be out telling them YOUr opinion on THEIR problems... but I do think that they could use a reminder from their child, who loves them.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	Take care of yourself. This can be your greatest gift. This is their problem, all you can do is tio be in their range when they need you. But you cannot let their problems become your problems. Look after yourself so that you will be healthy enough that they do not worry about you. They are bound to worry about it's effects on you as well.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Your parents' divorce and private, marital issues are none of your business... This is something you don't need to put your two cents into.<br>  <br>  However, you can let them know you care and love them.|`|h1lDGNp4aa	There is nothing you can do; this is between them.  Unfortunately it affects you.|`|zpQnYV0saa	I'm really sorry, My parents went through a very bad divorce a couple years ago after about 4 years of fighting and hurting. There's really nothing that you can do, it's something only they can work out. It's actually best for you not to get involved because it could make things worse than they are, I had to learn that the hard way. Just try to be understanding of why this is happening, Divorce isn't easy for anybody. You should find a friend or someone to talk to about it, I more than anybody know that it's not easy to talk about personal stuff like this, but it really does help to say this stuff out loud to another person even if they don't really have any real advice for you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|Ii5udGmJaa	No there is Absolutely nothing you can do to help them. Most of all<br>  DO NOT BLAME YOURSELF. I know this from experience my own parents were getting a divorced the time , I tried helping it only backfired in my face , then later on I started to think that I did something wrong and started to blame myself for it. Because of this I led a very horrible life.<br>  You do not want to live the same life.<br>  Do not blame yourself. For you did absolutely nothing wrong.<br>  2. don't try to help them resolve their problems because this is something that only they can resolve by themselves or with the help of a marriage counselor.<br>  <br>  If you really want to help them , do so by making sure that every that needs to be done around the house is done. I.E , chores done , home work done if any. House spotless , make it so that your parents have very little to nothing to worry about being done around the house. including cooking dinner. <br>  I know that this probably asking a lot of you but its the honest truth , and its the best way to help them. <br>  If you wish you may contact me via e-mail or instant message.<br>  Hope this helps , please feel to contact me with any and all further questions regarding this subject.|`|CaWf475jaa	They are both grown ups though sometimes they may not act like one.  If you are personally affected then I guess you have to tell them.  But if you just want to help them out let them settle their own problems.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	You can't help.

2fW267GMaa	The best revenge you can ever get is ignoring her.  She will feel like a complete fool for losing you.  Don't do anything to make yourself look like an ******.  Doing that would just show her that she was right in leaving you.  Be mature about it and she will regret the day she broke your heart.  She will hurt a whole lot because she knows she can't have you any longer.  It will drive her crazy.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend getting back with someone that hurt you once before.  Why reward her for what she did.  Its like saying she can do it again and you will still come back to her.  I don't know how deep your feelings are for her though, so you have to decide.<br>  <br>  Move on with your life and meet some new people.  It's her loss.  Let her suffer because of what she did to herself and not what you do to her.|`|31ac7af70f781384d9825a87cc62d0f2aa	well u already in the stages of getting over it, getting revenge will just be like digging up the past feelings..best "revenge" u can get here is to ignore her in the same manner she did u..smile and move on|`|xCAbKKIOaa	revenge|`|DNknBxRWaa	you were bugging her to take you back and when she agrees... you want revenge. go for it :)|`|6606e05490b3dda4a1a50ccc078bc327aa	Don't be mean. Be mature. Give it some time. Don't take her right away and let her have her way with you. She has to respect you and you have to respect yourself. This will give you time to find her real intentions for trying to get back with you. Remember she's not the only girl in the world. She probably thought the same if she was cheating on you.|`|FG5xXm2maa	revenge just defines an as_hole. Be the better person.<br>  <br>  I don't think she meant to do that for revenge, she probably just missed you. But she sounds quite harsh, I wouldn't take her back.

If you are going to talk to her just find out  what her side of the story was for the break up. But do not get back with her! If you do all that resentment, anger and heartbreak you felt is just going to tear you apart. Be the bigger man and walk away treating her like gold. She will kick herself in the *** for letting you get away. And tell herself her friends and family how bad she screwed up. Give it time and when you don't hate her no more then maybe you can try again.|`|gdGI16nmaa	well if you say she was mean to you, then you should do the same thing back =] you said she ignored you right? well do the same until she apologizes to you and when she does ( if she does), then its your choice if you'd like to go back out with her then go ahead but if you don't want to becuase of how she treated you then you should ^_^ i hope i helped a bit =P|`|Y4t1ErHjaa	not worth it.  leave her be, and ignore her<br>  <br>  unless you want here back, then forgive and forget|`|HEEbJd6iaa	**** her hard|`|sGvEU9j8aa	straight up, tell her exactly how you feel.<br>  how shitty she treated you, and how much of a ***** she was, then say i am sorry, i am over you, and walk away.<br>  leave it that way.|`|1qTNn8qnaa	If u have feelings for her and itll help u to be back with her then hook up again...if u totally hate her then treat her the same way she treated u and refuse to take her back.
1fa8H0m8aa	it doesn't matter if you are married or not. If it is not a mutual agreement..and you force someone to "do it"..then you are raping them.  Trust me..they can prove it.  Listen.  If you are forced into doing something you don't want to do..then its rape. If this is happening..and happening constantly, you need to report it to the police..and get a restraining order.  Good luck to you.|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Only when it is a guy pressuring a woman, right feminists?|`|rNIFQKF9aa	of course if someone says no and you still force them to have sex its rape no matter who you are|`|AA12135516	Yes!|`|efxBqKybaa	yes. rape is wen they have force sex with you, an u dont consent to it, it doesnt matter if u love them or are maried to them its still rape!|`|uvICu0gNaa	yeah it's called RAPE|`|ghz5D5iLaa	A married person can still be raped. Being married to someone does not give you the right to have sex with them against their will. You can prove it the way you do a normal rape. They can tell when there is trauma by an exam. Being forced to have sex against your will kind of kills the sexual attraction and the love.|`|AA11043457	Yes.  If she says no and means it and he doesn't stop, it is rape.  You might have to check some state's laws as to the penalties or whatever.  I'm sure that there would be problems proving it, but with rape, when a person is not ready, there could be tearing or damage or bruising.  If those exist, then she might be able to prove it.  It could also be used in case of divorce as well.  It is an assault.  Any unwanted touching can be an assault.<br>  <br>  If the person forces you when you say no, even if  you love them and are sexually attracted, it would e force and rape.  Now it may be possible that the person would change their mind in that case before sex and it might be consensual.  but why would anyone force a spouse even?  Could be drunk and so if love the person and normally attracted, that can be rape..<br>  <br>  Some people use sex like hitting as punishment or abuse.  <br>  <br>  This is not a legal opinion and some states could be different.  Yet I tend to think not just harder to prove in some cases.
NfE70Vr8aa	Its actually understandable. Just because he was an asshole doesn't mean you guys didn't have chemistry. i know it sounds weird but its ok to feel like that. just think of your man that you have now. he will make things better. break ups are hard and take time to get over. you will be fine sweetheart. just keep the thoughts happy.|`|zFFJ3zYhaa	coz you still love him...|`|RpxKmUBUaa	It's natural to feel this way, because it's like someone died to you, and even if he was a d*ck, he was someone special at one point. Give yourself time, and just learn to let him go.

O0pYOOpAaa	It depends how old you are. You sound young. If he is in love with you he is not using you for sex. If he is not in love with you, chances are he may be just trying to get sex.<br>  <br>  From my perspective (typical guy's perspective):<br>  he likes you, cares for you, make sure you're doing fine, kiss you all the time, always wants to touch your arms (he doesn't touch your legs YET because he doesn't want you to feel disrespected but wants you to feel cherished by him), holds you, hugs you, spends time with you because he want to and not because he thinks he has to. <br>  <br>  If he does most of that then its highly unlikely that he is using you for sex.<br>  <br>  If a guy smiles at you most of the time while he is looking at you then yes he is in love with you. I tend to do that alot.<br>  <br>  Not having sex with him for a long time can also be a way to see if he is real or not, but you could do adverse damage. He may take you not having sex with him as rejection. Overtime, he will resent you for not loving him back (sex=is a major part of real love for many guys), and abandon or even cheat on you. It's usually cheating from what I've seen.<br>  <br>  With that being said, do what feels comfortable to you, or not.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Stop having sex and see if they stick around.

3Ry2iuGBaa	If you want a relationship based on lies and deceiption, then don't tell him.

(BTW, it isn't really "cheating" so don't beat yourself up too much.)  <br>  <br>  Telling him will only make YOU feel better.  I say that you should continue to feel horrible and not say anything.|`|YJ3s8Alcaa	3 weeks? That's all?<br>  Um, well I guess if he hasn't contacted you in a week, though these things can happen. You should have confirmed whether you were still going out or not before hooking up with someone else.<br>  I guess tell him that it was a mistake because you didn't know if you two were still going out.
AA10194192	He may or may not. The fact you catch him looking at you and him complimenting your haircut are good signs. When it comes to texting, personally, I try to text back as soon as possible but it could simply be him not realizing he has a message, a common problem I have. Sometimes the delay is also for a dramatic effect. In my opinion i think he has some feelings for you but may not be sure, give him some hints or invite him out with a bunch of other people and see how he responds. Good Luck : )|`|s25KpIsDaa	Honey he does not like you sorry but all hlthose signs are that he doesn't like you the only reason he looks at u is cause u look at him and he probably just wanna be friends with u cause if your friends like him too and slot of other girls do to none of them have any chance if he liked you .

5VHWy0Ggaa	omg...<br>  <br>  because THEY can get pregnant, idiot! and you're obviously not mature enough to be a father. you're probably like 17, and a little player just trying to get in their pants...<br>  <br>  and how are they supposed to just trust you that you don't have an STD. just because you say you don't have one, doesn't mean that you're lying to them!<br>  <br>  you shouldn't be having sex...|`|vj2pWs9Maa	People like you are how STDs get transmitted.  You might be clean, but a girl you sleep with might not be.  You could get an STD but show no symptoms, then spread it around.<br>  <br>  It scares me that there are ignorant people like you out there.<br>  You can't get pregnant, but a girl you sleep with could - then you'll be paying child support for the next 18 years.|`|bmL3W289aa	Because your partner may have an STI and she may transmit it to you if there is no condom inbetween. But I don't care, I hope she does, seeing as you don't care if she gets pregnant. She doesn't want you screwing up her whole life, jerk.|`|ztb7OCvyaa	Do you honestly think that just because you've been tested once that means you're clean for life? If you want to stay clean, you'd better keep it wrapped or keep it in your pants. It's estimated that over 80% of women will have HPV (the virus that causes genital warts and is linked to cervical cancer) by the time that they're 50. 1 in 3 sexually active adults have or have had an STI. To answer your question, I'm not "scared" of anything, so fear has nothing to do with the reasons why I choose to use condoms.<br>  <br>  1. Pregnancy and babies do not fit into my life right now.<br>  2. I do not want to put hormones in my body and I do not like the risk of stroke associated with the pill (I'm already at risk because of family history) so I choose not to use the pill.<br>  3. I've been tested and so has my boyfriend, however, things happen. People cheat, people break up, people have outbreaks of STD's that it's not entirely possible to be tested for before lesions appear (like HPV and herpes).<br>  <br>  To put it simply I use condoms because it's my life and my health and I do not feel like putting either on the line for sex. If a  guy does not understand my reasons for condom usage he can move on.|`|FVozOguzaa	Don't be a fool<br>  Wrap your tool<br>  <br>  If your with someone you can trust and get tested together, and are on some form of birth control then you lower your risks.|`|ba11546863a841cea0081f35f682a3ccaa	They dont want RISKING their life getting STD or pregnant or WORST , BOTH...by you!|`|zFx7NT2Baa	Lots of good advice here.  Pay strict attention.|`|Vxk3oifMaa	So it can lessen the chance of  you getting and STI (STD) and it's more safer, some STIs can't be cured and can cause many problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy ( when the fetus is attached to the fallopian tubes. And yes some girls are scared of getting pregnant, especially if it is an unwanted pregnancy. Many girls have to make the decision of either abortion or motherhood which is very difficult and in some countries abortion is illegal so you have no choice but to become a mother. Unless you get a "back-alley abortion" (which are more dangerous)|`|qJ52Y9Auaa	Girls want you to use condoms to protect themselves not only from getting pregnant, but also from STD's. Girls, can get birth control such as the pills, patches or injections, but those will NOT protect her from getting STD's. She doesn't know if you have an STD and even if you got tested and don't have them yet, you still can get it later on if you keep having sex without condoms, girls have STD's too, you know. So it's best to protect both yourself and the girl you are having sex with. I wouldn't have sex with a guy unless he used a condom (only exception is when I'm married).|`|xvxtQwV5aa	because obviously they are more responsible than you. They realize that they don't want to bring an unexpected child into the world and they don't want to get an std.heard of hpv, hiv, aids, gonorhea, chlamydia, tric, herpes?  did you know that 1 in 4 teen girls have an std because they fail to use proper protection?? If a girl has an std and you don't wear a condom, guess who has an std now? it's you. And then you will give it to every girl you sleep with and so on. That's what's wrong with the world today, too many careless people. How do you think AIDS came about? too many partners and not enough protection. and now people die every year from stds because they had unprotected sex. I hope you don't cry like a little baby when it hurts to pee, or you have to spend your the rest of your short life in a hospital bed trying to live, or take 50 pills 2x a day just to live (which will put you in tremendous debt if you can even afford it). People like you should be nuetered. just know, your days are likely numbered.|`|di3oPe8waa	Then you're not going to get very much sex.<br>  <br>  J@ck @$$|`|cbt4I1cuaa	then you wont get laid dude std are serious having a child is to!  get over yourself and use them|`|ACNECiZAaa	You have no STDs and you're not pregnant you say....well if you want to STAY that way use one.|`|rLHhZMlbaa	a$$hole|`|c1d2c88ff0f3df80bdee984eca4b94fdaa	Wearing a condom is for protection of not only the woman but also yourself. A condom helps protect against unwanted pregnancy for the woman, which would also affect the man. Also, even though you have been tested for STDs and proven to be negative, many STDs may take months or years to show up positive on a test. Also, condoms protect a man from STDs that they may be exposed to by a woman. Having respect for your own body and the bodies of those you choose to have sex with would require you to use a condom every time you have sex.|`|tMJITxk7aa	People like you shouldn't even have sex, clearly are aren't mature enough.<br>  Fact is, it's not about you. You can't get pregnant, but they can, and if you have any consideration for your partner, you would honor their wishes.<br>  Don't be a tool.|`|3ox4lYu6aa	I agree with the first poster: you aren't going to get much sex. Some girls don't want to get pregnant. And its to protect from and STD. What if your partner has one? If you don't use a condom then it will be transmitted to you. You are such an idiot.|`|2mHbi6Exaa	those are the 2 most common lines that guys use to get sex and keep from having to use a condom, and they're lies. smart girls just don't want to take any chances. if you won't use a condom, there are loads of guys who will, so don't count on getting any.|`|ctSmc7UAaa	Of course.Why wouldn't we STDs and unwanted pregnancies?Better safe than sorry?
c773a6d9618f1549ce3fc0daab46330daa	Yes we do like good girls and most of us love kids. Every try at a relationship is a chance at getting hurt but usually it is always worth it. You are lucky and have 2 beautiful kids and if a man is worth anything then he will embrace your kids if he likes you. Most any relationship comes with some sort of strings and it is just something you have to work through. Odds are you will probably have to look for a bit of an older man but you will find a good one if you look and just put yourself out there.  <br>    good luck and God Bless|`|UinOWcMUaa	Should of waited -- huh :) Well, I have a kid too and single.. and wow, yeah.. it's been interesting to say the least..

But only put it out for the guys that you think are decent.|`|iAtanlT8aa	as an atheist, i couldn't see myself dating a strong christian, but i want a good girl, not a bad one, and if I really really liked that girl, I wouldn't care if she had kids.|`|hlE3nwyGaa	Get rid of him, you'll find a guy that will like you for you and he won't care about the kids.

Tell sherry hi for me and Killers_ is an a**hole|`|7PS3fSSPaa	Ok in reality at  the age your at most guys do not want a girl with kids but it is'nt impossible to find one that does. You need to go out and have fun. The guys will come accordingly. These are things that you must be patient for, Just keep a good figure cause i hate to tell you but that is something i know that everyone looks at, well at least guys. Im not saying all guys are jerks but in order for you to go out and talk to someone you have to be attracted. In the long run looks are a little important. But it is possible to find a guy who will date girls alot of my friends and family have. But to find the right person you just have to live your life and enjoy it and more than likely they will come to you. And as far as the good girl you dont have to be all Religious when your dating. You can be a little bad and still be a good girl. Trust me we want a good girl for a wife but a bad girl or not so good when dating.|`|EdDLydH7aa	I'm not a guy, and killers answer was funny, but on the serious side, there is someone out there for everyone and at least you know now and got out of the relationship, you may want to seek counseling to deal with the abuse b/c that is devastating. If and when you do find someone else, you don't want to carry the drama into that relationship, i;ve been through it and it sucks, but now i'm just biding my time and waiting for the right one to come along...good luck to you and best wishes|`|dztKGMAQaa	It's true that some "guys dont want that baby drama," but anybody who would pass you by because you have kids is, I believe, not worth the effort to try to attract in the first place.<br>  <br>  And while I'm a firm believer in waiting until the wedding night (which, I admit, I didn't do), it's no guarantee of superior results, though it does give you an idea of the depth of someone's devotion.<br>  <br>  It may take a while, but I think you'll find someone; there's certainly no reason to mark you as Damaged Goods and put you up on the shelf.  (Everyone makes mistakes, after all.)

cCld8P9Naa	dude she likes you ok simple point is this she checks you out when your not looking so there is some point of interest there.  And it is apparent you like her.  The suck part is both of you are shy.  Keep up the online chatter with her and give a little of yourself to her in the chatter like simple talk.  You need to find out if you have the same interest and stuff like that.  Take it from someone who is also shy when it come to meeting people.  Then when you are both actually comfortable with each other take the step and meet not at school but at a public place  of interest and meet and continue the talk.  But remember to keep breathing.  best of Luck|`|mc8Regxjaa	she is just shy just start a light conversation about something she is interested in to make her fell comfortable then take it from there

Obviously, the two of you are not on the same page.<br>  <br>  Maybe he thinks that, since you have talked about married, that means you are engaged, so he doesn't have to buy you a ring.  Maybe he doesn't realize that talking about marriage meant that he was supposed to go out and buy a ring.<br>  <br>  He probably just doesn't understand what you want from him right now.  Talk to him about it.  And be gentle.|`|AA10494978	OK, firts of all, RELAX.  You don't know for sure he didn;t buy a ring and is keeping it for a time when he is ready to propose.  Second, 2012?

HKkbqlIuaa	1. My perfect guy is sweet and caring, but manly and dominant when he needs to be. He is fun and kinky. He likes to do the things I do, and we get along. Etc, etc, etc. <br>  <br>  2. If you're asking this to try and find out what girls want, don't bother. Every single girl is different. People like different things and different personalities. If you try to put on a facade of what you think the perfect guy is, you'll never have a good relationship because you have to be yourself. If you aren't, you're going to have to put on a charade every day. Eventually, you will get tired of it and dump her. So just stick with yourself.|`|hmMb2oMOaa	my best friend|`|i88wWUdLaa	Hah.

He doesnt have to be drop dead gorgeous, but looks have somewhat of an effect on who you want to get to know. He has to have a good personality no matter what. What I look for in a personality is a good sense of humor, but yet knows when to be serious. He has to be trusthworthy. A guy who concieted is a turnoff, but he has to have some confidence in himself. Also, desperate thats a turnoff and what I mean by desperate is he pretty much throws himself at you and wants you to be his girlfriend. We got to have somewhat of a chase. Not to hard to get though. You got to show some interest. Um. He likes me for me not by my looks. (I'm a pretty girl and well guys go after me cause im pretty, but not really for who i am) He has to be outgoing and fun. I dont like a guy who is to touchy feely. We girls gotta have some space. We dont like it when guys are constantly hovering over us. Thats the short version.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	I'm a little young to be able to describe my perfect guy but I guess I'd say that he would have to be sweet and funny.

3kBcHJIIaa	There is absolutely no reason at all to be ashamed of your sexuality. I myself have had questions about my sexuality, and I had a friend that was a girl that made me feel similar. Maybe finding someone who also liked girls could be a solution, or if your dead-set on this girl, just try being friends. I myself never told my friend, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't. If she's the kind of friend that will freak out and tell everyone, maybe its better to keep your mouth shut to her. If she's a loyal girl, maybe telling her would be a better choice. Who knows? Maybe she really does like you and was afraid to admit it to you because she didn't know if you felt the same! :D<br>  <br>  God Luck, and never be afraid of who you are!|`|ACgiEEeaaa	you are bisexual. i don't think it is bad but you should not discuss it openly. don't spoil your relation if your friend does not feel the same. when you find someone like that then you can go forward.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	It's just like having a crush on a guy who doesn't like you back.

AA11043457	You are not as confused and screwed up as he is.  He has been hurt at some time and won't trust.  It is hard to really love that way.  And you are right, lack of trust should come from something one does to break that trust.  It can affect love when someone does that.  You haven't done anything not to deserve his trust.<br>  <br>  I have a situation where I love my husband, but some of that love has eroded as I can't trust him in some ways.  He is an addictive personality and he stole my vicodin and took them - large doses. He suffers from depression and says it was because he wanted to feel normal.  I have to keep medications in a safe now - to which he doesn't have the combination.  I can't trust him.  So sometimes it is more like a mother child relationship than a husband wife one.  he doesn't take responsibility for his actions but someone else is always the problem.  Or he will say, "It's always my fault, everything is my fault." which is a way of trying to get someone to say it isn't.  Well, it is.  He was the one who abused medications and stole the vicodin. He is the one who made it necessary for me to lock up our medications and to parcel them out.  <br>  <br>  So I do love him, but  it isn't the same as it was..  There are times when he is great and he does a lot for me - maybe to make up for his problems.  but he has lied to me in the past.  He lied even in his psychiatrists office telling us that he didn't steal the vicodin - that was 2nd time when he took it from my medicine divider which I have to keep a few out of the safe to take.  Then when psychiatrist told him that he could give him a drug test and asked if he'd take it, he said yes.  And he said, and that means that we won't find tht  you have drugs in  your system?  He wouldn't say that and then admitted to taking them.  So he has earned my distrust.<br>  <br>  If he can't trust you (not that you deserve it but won't trust you, then he will always doubt you and make your life miserable.  You don't deserve that as you did nothing.<br>  <br>  He is pushing you out of his life in someways and maybe you should go.  You will always have to deal with his problems because he is not dealing with them himself.  You can encourage him to get counseling but I doubt he'll go. So why be miserable  yourself?  You are too young.  I'm 65 and we have more of a platonic relationship and take care of one antoher. I'd not do that if I were a lot younger.  I feel sorry for him.  He needs help in coping.  But sometimes he has good times as well.  It is not easy dealing with someone with emotional problems - and your friend has emotional problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|rb8OGnmZaa	I would say "yes".  Your boyfriend will learn to trust you though.

7iEk06aDaa	Your probably going through a phase where time is your enemy. Like, where have the years gone,and yes, your memory does dim after awhile. Just to be on the safe side, why don't you get tested to see if you have Alzheimer's. Does it run in your family?

ScFCxnnOaa	Well you really should talk to your dad about what your mom said just so he can maybe speak with her, and reassure her that he will be bringing you back. You should consider your mother's opinion, but it is something you get a choice in. Try talking to your mom and dad together.|`|ygccpU2paa	This is between your parents to sort out.  You are a minor and depending on the custody agreement, your father may not have to consult your mother at all, OR he may not be allowed to take you unless she agrees.  If he's not sure, then he needs to ask an attorney to review the custody agreement before he risks a contempt of court charge.  Have him read this post so he knows you are being emotionally torn in two.  This is NOT APPROPRIATE PARENTING.  Good luck, sweetie.|`|1235333b4f34f1147fc81bf4aef8885baa	If you're under 18, your mom has to give approval for you to leave the country.

It's not safe and not recommended by the US state department for tourism.<br>  <br>  While a trip to Africa could definitely be a memorable, awesome experience, this is not really a good time for it from a safety standpoint.  It will be difficult for you to convince your mom to let you go and it's really her choice.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	I think you already know what you need to do.

LeX9Z7jjaa	If you want her to feel more comfortable tell her how much her reactions to you pleasing her turns you on. I love when my boyfriend says things like "you're so sexy". It really makes a huge difference. My last b/f (I'm not a ****, I was with him for 5 years) wasn't as vocal about things.. I find myself now with my current boyfriend (been with him for 2 years) doing new things and not being shy about anything at all and that's because of the way that he acts towards the things that I do.. He is very vocal with telling me when something I do is hot.. or if I'm pleasing him telling me how good it feels.<br>  <br>  As far as her begging to have sex with you and you not wanting to just "stick it in there" that's very gentlemen like of you.. but I would say if you guys are already doing as much stuff together as you are she very well might be ready to take that step with you. Question is are YOU ready to do there with her?? I would be a hypocrite to tell you not to go that route with her and really think about things before you take that step because I first had sex when I was 17, so..   I can say though that's good that you are taking it slow about having sex.. Might be preventing a later regret either on your part, or hers.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	She's just being self-conscious. She needs to learn how to let go and enjoy herself. Also, if she thinks she'll be able to get off from sex, she's crazy. She needs to learn to get off from foreplay before moving on to sex. She is not ready for that.|`|nNE3hVV7aa	I hate the same F_U_K_I_N_G dilema, They push you away before they orgasm. I don't get it, it fucks with my head all the time. I've been with my partner for 3 years and she still pushes me away, i try sneak back in or force my head down there but she still closes her legs and shoves me away, then lays there puffing and panting like ive actually done something.<br>  <br>  It feels so useless.|`|3FjDT8yKaa	you're a super good guy by turning it down<br>  which prob makes her want to have sex with you more because it shows that she can trust you with it<br>  <br>  & tell her that her moans turn you on or something positive

eBEfZO9eaa	Life is not about comparing ourselves to others.  Your self-esteem should come from being a nice person, taking care of your family, your career and/or whatever other things also make you happy in life.  The way celebrities and models look is not the norm of what most people look like.  You should also feel good about yourself because you are trying to lose the baby weight instead of just sitting around not caring at all, but the most important thing is to lose weight and stay fit for HEALTH, not appearances.  And, you might want to sit down and seriously explain to your husband how bad his wandering eye and comments are making you feel.  Make it a serious heart-to-heart conversation not at the time when it is happening, but at a time when you are both relaxed and have time to discuss.  Also, it seems that the more people complain about their appearance, the less other people want to hear about it--be a happy, outgoing person with a lot of interests/hobbies, etc. in your life and you'll be so much fun to be around your husband won't these other women and you won't be so depressed.  Good luck!|`|t4aqoR2Aaa	I am trying to overcome mine at 15. Good luck to you.|`|WPe2fAe3aa	it's whats inside that matters, remember your not the only one who's not model gorgeous, but u have a husband who loves you for you. All men ogle at women its natural he's not saying he doesn't love you and that your not beautiful, hes just looking at a pretty lady as u would a handsome man. But to make yourself feel better go get a make over, what ever makes you feel as beautiful as your husband and other men think you are. Just try to remember not to compare yourself to models because your beautiful in a different way than they are and NO ONE REALLY LOOKS LIKE THAT!|`|wGKBuipYaa	First of all this is just my personal opinion, Don't blame your husband for looking at other women, Its not his fault its just built into his nature. Guys could be with the hots supermodel in the world and if another girl walks by they r still going to check them out. Its really just something  built into the male brain that we have no control of.  But that in no way means he is going to cheat love is a way more powerful emotion. Second do not feel down on yourself i am sure you have many quality's that  your husband loves. Believe it or not looks are not everything. If that still doesn't help. Dress in something u  sexy and go out with your husband,Keep a eye out for looks u get. I guarantee you will get some looks. Some times people are so caught up in everyday life. They miss the signals they picked up when they were still single.  Do not beat yourself up, From what i can tell you are well put together women. You just need a self esteem boost. Work on loving yourself as much as u do your family and things will come around. Good luck to you.|`|IvMPh09baa	well... i don't think your insecurity is coming from nowhere.  you wrote that your husband openly talks about other women and tells you he is no longer attracted to you the same.  what an incredibly insensitive thing to say/do.<br>  <br>  i am sorry, but i really don't agree with you wanting to make peace with your husband checking out other women.  its absolutely inappropriate.  I would highly suggest you go to counseling or speak with a friend... because for some reason you are letting this man treat you like crap and you are ignoring the fact that you do not deserve this.<br>  <br>  get some counseling and work on your confidence.|`|nCTh2y0Haa	Don't worry too much about the physical aspects of your relationship. It will destroy you. focus on what your body can do, rather than what it looks like. Learn a new skill, like dance, piano..whatever you like. It'll boost your confidence like nothing else. That way, you'll know you have something special. The key here is to place less emphasis on beauty, which, I know, is so so hard to do. Build yourself up as a person. Establish yourself as talented, unique and overall irresistible. Take care of yourself, don't beat yourself down. Beauty is not that important. It fades, just like everyone else...The day will come when that swimsuit model can't model anymore. Instead, focus on  the things that matter most in life- your man loves YOU, that's why he's with YOU, just the way you are.

And just thinking about them makes you smile.<br>  ~ It makes you really sad when they have to leave or when you don't get to see them.<br>  ~ You would do almost anything to make them happy. You would do almost anything to be with them.<br>  ~ You  just want to hold onto the person and never let go.<br>  ~ You feel like you'll always be happy, as long as you have this person.

0MYTPRfdaa	I would strong suggest working with dating coach, if you feel new or uncertain in your meeting and dating abilities. I worked with dating coach for a few month last year and it helped me a lot. My dating life has improved big time since then as well. I worked with New York Dating Coach, and they done an excellent job of easing me into dating, i was in a relationship for 4 years. Me and Ex broke up 5 month ago, and i felt like fish out of the water, it was strange to start dating again. Since i never been good at meeting women to begin with, i was uncertain what to do. So i went to dating coach, i really didn't have much to lose. I meeting a lot more now, probably 3 time more then i did before the coach, and i find myself meeting and dating women that are my type, which was certainly not the case before.|`|sSpOCUGNaa	New York City AKA you need Money, lots of drinking.. <br>  <br>  well i found craigslist worked very well for me when i lived there.<br>  <br>  also match.com in new york people are always busy and moving around and fast pace.. <br>  <br>  Match.com is perfect

Look i know it's very difficult to forget him or being with anyone but u have to understand that you are alone now ur boyfriend is also not supporting u bcoz of his father's health  As the time will move on the person you will get marry u will start loving him.  May be ur partner will love you more than that boy.  I can understand ur bf's prob also. So move on in ur life as ur bf will move up. Don't try to break down. Live life. Best of luck for your future.|`|9HFYshQ1aa	If this guy of urs is backing off for his dad's sake there must be some reason behind it(well the heart problem).certain things cant be changed.trying to convince him doesn give any solution.If ur issue makes his father's health bad or worse(God Forbid)..later he might feel that its all coz of u.At that point feelin guilty wil not be of any use dear.So its better u leave him.Try talking to him once..if the status is stil the same...then u have been left with no choice than to leave him.|`|VXON0EZaaa	HIM Queen........<br>  <br>  you've said "my ex - bf which means u've already mentally prepared to accept that he;s gone<br>  <br>  i think u got to confirm that HE too is dying to have u ......because,  only if ur bf has the same feelings and determination towards you, then only  can u step further towards him.<br>  <br>  You say  ...."i want him , i want him", but never expressed "he wants me" in your above question .<br>  <br>  check out if he is 1. Still n love, 2.Does he miss u 3. Does he keep calling you . 4. Has he taken a lame excuse of telling about his Father and is avoiding you.  ( cas true love is beyond everything else) and in these years ( unlike olden days) .......a weak heart is not a heart that is non-curable.  5. Have  u been a victim of a one sided love ?  <br>  <br>  If most of them turns against u.....u got to think..... as to where u r heading?<br>  <br>  above all.....u cannot let ur'self down.....u got to move on and on n life.<br>  <br>  so take u r decisions with patience and maturity .<br>  <br>  bye......n all the best u r way.
JOuomnisaa	Why are you only blaming the woman?  <br>  <br>  I don't want to rock your world too much, but I wonder if your dad cheated on his ex with your mom?  If so, this would certainly be perfect Karma.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to make light of it-- it must be terribly painful for you--but please let your parents deal with the ex.  You are, of course, free to tell your Dad exactly what you think of him.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	Why are you only blaming the lady??  Maybe you should confront your father it takes two to tango.  You should be mature about the situation.|`|wTYPomqQaa	JUST SHUT UP!  You and your mom are dumb if you only want to beat her ***, what about your dad? it takes two to tango! kick your dad out he is scum!|`|c09eca5427e724d10b85a9e09c797c54aa	It takes two people to be involved in an affair. Your dad is just as the blame than the ex. I know you are upset and you have every right to be, but only your mom have to handle it. His ex will get hers for doing this so let God handle the ex.Your mom should comfort him about it and let him that you also knows about the affair and your dad should speak to you. He owes your family an apology, and a guarantee that it won't happen again. He is your dad and he needs the support from his family, especially from you. I am sorry that this happen but promise yourself that you wouldn't do this to your family. I know your parents loves you.|`|AA10757358	This is between your parents as to what to do about this situation.  You could make matters worse if you get involved in it.

Good luck to them!|`|YHwVw2pdaa	I think you and your mom should confront your dad and the lady... If the lady is married herself, then DUDE that is soo wrong! I feel bad for your mom.

If you try to hit her you may have bigger problems on your hand (jail time) and your mom would have something else to worry about. Let the adults deal with their issue. Your mom have several choice she can utilize to deal with the problem, all you have to do is be there for her.|`|wr9lPEtVaa	I think your mum should confront your dad about this, ask him why & tbh if he says something insulting, that means a break up which means you choose who to live with. Also i have kinda experienced the same thing except my mum cheated on my dad with his cousins husband. I hated him & i did feel like smashing his head in repeatedly, but it doesn't solve anything. What you should do is just let your mum & dad solve this because i got involved & it caused alot of sh*t for everyone.|`|WyDsza2Faa	How do you know your dad didnt make the first move. I am not defending her becasue she shouldnt have gone near a married man in the first place.

231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	wow thats weird, before i actually clicked on your question, i read your title and immediately said to myself, "turn to God," and then when i opened you question i realized it had to do with God. <br>  but anyways...<br>  Although you are not a virgin any longer, i envy the fact you waited as long as you did. Im 16 years old, and hope to keep my virginity till marriage, but also have wondered about what is on your mind right now, if abstinence didn't end up happening. <br>  I wish i could ask my dad what i should write to you right now, but he is sleeping. He would really know what to tell you, especially what to say so that you can sleep better. maybe you can e-mail me and i can e-mail you back what he has to say later.<br>  But if you choose to skim over this answer, then all i can say is that the lord will forgive you.<br>  And some people might think that since you had sex with a guy, you must marry that guy. Dont jump into anything so huge yet, because in the long run, it might not of been such a good decision.<br>  but im pretty tired myself, so i wish you luck in coming to peace with yourself and what you let happen!|`|c1gnFE8Gaa	Please tell me you are joking<br>  <br>  How can you possibily feel so much guilt over this seriously.<br>  <br>  I am sorry I dont agree with you in your views but seriously that much guilt over doing something with someone you love and trust.<br>  <br>  Anyway doesnt God forgive all?

Please take a deep breath and chill out.  It is over now. Just move forward from here. As the other poster said, God forgives all.|`|FyvrWG6laa	to renounce you have sinned and practice self control. Don't allow it to grow into another sin a more complicated one. Don't build  the "web' coz it might coz u into more trouble or if not cannot get out from it. So as early as now, say no to your body and release the guilt feelings. Ask the Lord for more strength, go to your pastor and ask him to pray for you. Nothing to be ashamed of coz everyone sin like yours. God bless you...|`|aLgY4l3Naa	No one is perfect and WE ALL make mistakes, so don't keep beating yourself up over it!! You acknowledged your wrong and asked for forgiveness, so now its time TO FORGIVE YOURSELF!! The problem was not really the mistake you made but whether YOU LEARNED FROM IT, I THINK YOU DID!! Keep praying and staying close to GOD will help you from temptation and don't ever put yourself in a position were your morals and values will be compromised!! Good luck to you and i hope you give yourself a break from guilt now!!|`|dIw7MqTdaa	Just because you've done something once doesn't mean you won't repeat it.<br>  <br>  You probably also caught an STD seeing as your winner boyfriend has such low moral standards.

You've taken the first step and confessed that you've done wrong.I'm sure you've asked for forgiveness. I say don't let your bf trick you into doing it again. Even if your body is tempting you, he should respect you and your decision to wait. If he truly loves you he will understand and wait. You will be at peace  and also be rewarded later for you decision to overcome temptation and have  a much more fruitful relationship/ marriage.|`|a7282c8d9805b18630dede6429385de5aa	Beating yourself up isn't constructive-- to the contrary,  its unbearable. It tempts you to make excuses. <br>  <br>  Realize you are not helpless. You can't get physical unless you're alone with a guy. Avoid being alone and you avoid temptation. <br>  <br>  The fact you don't spontainously fall into sex in public also reveals a great deal.   Tempting situations do not predestine you to failure.<br>  <br>  Just because you did it once doesn't mean you'll do it again. <br>  Keep rededicating yourself to your values. Don't be discouraged.  <br>  <br>  What you did wasn't shocking or abnormal. Everyone makes mistakes.  The difference in character lies mainly in whether you keep making them.<br>  <br>  ~Nicole

5VHWy0Ggaa	my advice is to sit down and talk to him about everything... tell him that you want the fighting to stop and suggest the two of you thinking of a list of things that the other person can do to make the relationship better... or to help not fighthing. like ask what things can i do or try to work on, that will make things better? or what kinda things can i try to work on to make us not fight more... and then get together after you both make a list and take turns talking about them. hopefully that will be a step in the right direction...<br>  <br>  but i have to say that if things keep going the way they are going, you two need to end it. i know that this is going to be extremly hard, because i've been there and done that already... but as you know it hurts more to drag things out, it just makes it worse. and the fighting will continue to get worse. if you two cannot resolve things, and get along better, your relationship will not last. if it's not going to last then there is no reason to drag it out because you both will hurt more in the end... but remember that everything happens for a reason and sometimes things fall apart so other better things can come together... this is your first love, but necessarly won't be your last. if things don't work out, you will fall in love again.<br>  <br>  but i really do understand where you are coming from, and i hope that things really do get better.|`|oCGEPNc9aa	it sounds to me like you already know that the relationship is ending. i don't know how old you are, but i dated someone for 2 years and it was really hard to move on...i thought i would never get over him.  but looking back, i am soooooo glad i did and you will be too.  sometimes you just cant force things to work.  but when one door closes, another one opens...you'll be fine :)|`|qtoylDVnaa	I've been struggling with a similar situation, and I'm as baffled as you are. I think that all I can do about my own situation is to pray about the matter. Also I need to start hardening my own heart so if things don't work out I won't be as hurt, and start trying to find out about how much child support payments usually run a person. I hope things work out, but she has been breaking my heart over and over again lately. Good luck to you.
X9Ws9nToaa	Lickin ain't cheatin|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	When you have too much cake and eat it too a stomach ache will form.  Everything you have just said is what happens in any relationship when someone has cheated.   It must come to an end sooner or later.  What is so crazy is that you have been doing this for going on two years and didn't think that it would end badly.  You need to leave both of them because at the end of the day that is still his sister and you are an outsider(not a real wife) that played with both of their emotions.|`|CaWf475jaa	It has WRONG written all over it.  First you're a girl I suppose and you have fallen in love with a guy that's why you married him (your husband), second she is his sister, it is bad enough to cheat but to cheat you husband with his own sister, totally bad.  Do you have kids?  Think about that too if you have.  Do you still love your husband?  Are you willing to hurt him this way?  Think thing though.  Perhaps a vacation away from him, like go visit your family might clear your mind.|`|YkBb5y98aa	Well, I feel that you should tell him what you have been doing, be honest,. If he is willing to stay with you he is a good catch and should drop his sister.If he gets mad and what a divorce, than you have the girl. You my lose both, I know its hard but I believe honesty is what matters and sneaking behind his back is weird, and mean.|`|BSU9pNUWaa	She can't pop the question when your already married.

You wouldn't even be considering this is you didn't really want to do it. But you just need to evaluate what will happen to your life. Do you have children with your husband yet? How is this going to effect their family as well. Because you're obviously going to still see him at family functions. <br>  <br>  Just think it through and go with what your heart feels. That is where you'll find what your need best in life.|`|ahujYDBdaa	I dont think you will make such a great choice going with your husbands sister.

There is also a growing movement to decriminalize incest between consenting adults.  You could start a trend.<br>  <br>  Other than that, are you willing to leave your children behind?  You would be the one breaking up the marriage.  Your behavior is not appropriate even if it was his brother.  There's no easy answer here, but you do need to talk to him.  Also, you don't know who else she has slept with.  The dangers are still the same between women.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	This is serious. You know what you need to do.

If you have to get it off your chest, confide in a friend, loved one, clergy member, or counselor. Leave him to enjoy the peace that he continues to share and have with you, and with his relationship with you. After all these years of his believing in your innocence, i don't see the sense in breaking and ruining his confidence/faith in you/self-esteem, etc..|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You should never ever ever say a damn thing.  Carry the guilt to your grave.  What you experience is guilt but should the pain be inflicted completely unnecessarily to your partner?  Absolutely not.  You would be a fool to say a thing more than half your life later and raise suspicions unnecessarily to do nothing more than relieve yourself because you feel bad.  How would he feel?  Could he ever forgive you?  Would you lose a perfectly suited husband?  Hey...you did it, carry the load forever.  Nobody is squeaky clean and those that claim they are most likely aren't.  Be guilty and ashamed forever but don't hurt the man that may have done worse to you or may have been an angel.  He doesn't deserve it and ignorance is bliss.  Live in the present and forgive yourself finally.|`|UDInHk0jaa	I don't understand why you feel uncomfortable about keeping this secret NOW considering you have been for all these years.  Why now?  My opinion is that you want to get it off your chest, which is extremely selfish at this point.  Your lucky this relationship was...is a wonderful one.  Leave it alone.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	for get the past that will not repeat and see that this will not be repeated in life. every one will make mistakes and when you find it is fault; change your self by coming into the main stream by for giving your self and pray that the mistake will not repeated in future.|`|f8fs6kycaa	Fren... u have had a wonderful relation all this time...and c ur husband might also have had som stuffs lik dat in d past...(might have..ok)so why do u wan 2 tak it out now..its ok...God is not going to punish u 4 dat...jus tak dat out of ur mind and be wid him for d rest of ur life too...dont feel bad...it had happend and u dnt hav 2 punish urself takin it out...|`|AA11956029	i think its too late to tell him now....n how does it help your relationship...it will only make things worst n creat bitterness....whats gone is gone.....but if u r ready to risk your relationship n invite trouble...go on|`|YqkUDgL5aa	Hon, women are allowed a secret or two.  You've been with your husband all these years, and I am guessing you two are happy.  Why rock the boat now?|`|9ko5WUFkaa	NO - keep this to yourself.<br>  <br>  I'm not judging what you did - I understand that companionship is important and sometimes we, as humans, do things we wouldn't ordinarily do.<br>  <br>  What will you telling him achieve?  All you want to do is clear your conscious and telling him now would be very selfish of you.  If you tell him what you did he will look back on all the years you spent together as a lie.  He will never trust you or any feeling that you've expressed to him.  He would question your entire relationship.<br>  <br>  The only person that would gain anything out of this is you - but you stand to lose a lot more than a clear conscious is worth.  You've kept the secret this long, please keep it forever.  If you tell your husband you make (in his view) his whole life with you a lie.  It's not worth it.|`|CaWf475jaa	In my opinion past is past, if it doesn't mean anything to you why bring it up.  It has been eons of years ago.  You have been faithful eversince so why bring up something that might hurt him.  That's my opinion only.  But if your conscience is bothering you and you really have to get it out of your system well take your chances and hope and pray he will understand it.  To some people that is what death bed is for.  But let's not talk about that.  Have a long and happy life.|`|OYFoYDOaaa	tell him. its the best thign to do.<br>  if the worst possible thing happes itll mess up the marriage and you will pay up what you did honorably. plus you deserve it, im not being mean just realistic.<br>  <br>  he probably had affairs to. in japan LOL, japanese women.... u know?>?<br>  <br>  other than that if he DOES love you he will forgive you|`|V610w8EXaa	Sure, go ahead and tell him ... if you want a divorce, because that's what will happen.<br>  <br>  You committed adultery.  Even if it was 30 years ago, you don't have ANY excuse ... what a pathetic wife.|`|NviqYy6Xaa	if you tell him he will want to know why you didnt tell him before -- if you dont want to ruin this marriage dont tell him <br>  <br>  <br>  -- some things are best left unsaid|`|ahujYDBdaa	If you tell him, it would be hard for him to trust you again. Although, I do understand your point of how you two go on living your lives as though nothing has happened between you and that coworker. But if its the past, why not let it remain there? If you're certain that you wont cheat on your husband again, then leave it be. Imagine your husband coming up to you and telling you the same story, you'd be angry and hurt. But wouldnt you be wondering if you were just better off not knowing at all? I know I would, in a way. So I say dont bring the past into the future, because theres a reason why it remained in the past. It is the past, and that is where it will stay.
c1d2c88ff0f3df80bdee984eca4b94fdaa	The first thing you really want to consider is whether you are truly ok with him participating in the games, as you say you are. Often, as women, we want to let our husbands and boyfriends know that we do not want to control their behavior or lives but make sure you are fully comfortable with either answer. If you find you would be even a little upset with knowing he had participated, make note of that for the future and be honest beforehand when he is planning to put himself in potentially compromising situations. It appears as though subconsciously you want him to say that he didn't as you mentioned it would hurt you. He may be hesitant to tell you the truth as he knows it would hurt you. My best advice is to let this incident go and decide for the future to handle it differently beforehand. If you still want to encourage him to do such activities, make boundaries clear and also be totally honest with yourself on the consequences. The other option is to request that he abstain from such compromising or potentially hurtful activities in the future for the well-being of your relationship.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Just let it go for now.  You need to explain to him that you feel like he has disrespected you because he isn't confiding in you.  He is leaving it open for someone to come along and hurt your feelings with some information that he could have told you in the first place.|`|NviqYy6Xaa	ask the mate|`|D3hYbsVJaa	This is why I didn't have a bachelor party.|`|Rkik3eUuaa	he can not go to a strip party and not to participate in games with other mates - they will consider him a wuss and under your heel. this is an offense for a guy. u didn't want him to participate in games u shouldn't let him go. and he didn't want to tell u cos he didn't want u to become all hysterical and listen to your nagging
i88wWUdLaa	Yes. I believe that very much.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Okay, so when I was like 12 or whatever, I'd always be on online sites like Runescape (lol) and I'd have all these "internet bfs" hahah. Well, I knew I wasn't going to ever meet them and so forth, but it was fun. But in real life, I obviously still called myself single. After I was 12 I never really did that anymore. Anyways, I was talking to my friend about a month ago (she is 16... or 17? I am 15) and she talks to me sometimes about her boyfriend, and she'd be like, "He said blah blah blah to me..." And I'd be like, "Aw, that is so sweet!" and stuff like that. Well, I've never had a boyfriend (it doesn't really bother me, but anyways) and I said, "Um, where do you find a boyfriend??" And she was like, "Don't worry about it. It happens when you're happy about being single and you least expect it..." And I was thinking, "Okay, sounds reasonable." Anyways, then I said, "Well, where did you meet your boyfriend?" And she said, "YoVille!" And I was stunned. (YoVille is this little online thing with 2D avatars walking around... It's an app. on Facebook...) I was like, holy cow. This girl is WAY too old for this. And it's not like she calls him her "internet boyfriend," either, she calls him her BOYFRIEND. I said, "Um, have you ever MET him? Like, in real life?!?!" And she's like, "No." WOW. I was so shocked.<br>  <br>  And this is much crazier than those e-harmony sites or whatever. Like, she was never ever going to meet him in real life and called him her boyfriend... Wow...
t0PzSCs0aa	she's clearly very jealous and probably a liar too.<br>  <br>  don't let it bother you too much. he's your man now, not hers. she had her chance and obviously screwed it up. enjoy the time you have with him, dont let dumb things like ex's get in the way.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	Ya relax first..<br>  well she does have issues.. and maybe the child is his??<br>  did u ever think of that..<br>  but since ur BF told u u should trust him :)<br>  she is Jealous of u she might still have feelings for him..<br>  she's not over him yet, and seeing him with another woman kills her..|`|BEy22O6jaa	or maybe she's actually pregnant for him???<br>  you guys should definitely talk about it.he could be the problem.|`|40Ow9B1maa	well she could be pregnant if they had sex and he cheated on you and hes just been lying to u alot of men do tht|`|SWBsLshtaa	Someone's desperate<br>  <br>  The truth will come out sooner or later, then she will be exposed as the lying skank she is<br>  <br>  Dont worry, it'll all work out|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	yeah i guess so, she is probably missing your boyfriend and is trying to brake you guys up because she wants him back.|`|YvJdkSNaaa	Her problem may be that she is pregnant with his baby yet he is dating you.|`|bZA3TntMaa	just Little jealous.|`|eA2Wz9tAaa	just relax|`|CaoVS1cdaa	yeah I agree with the first answer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|YGDsepzuaa	well she could be pregnant with his child seeing as you only been together for 4 months. also if she wants to be your freind on myspace, maybe she's trying to tell you what is really going on behind your back and he doesnt want you to know.you should accept her invitation and figure out if she is crazy or not. women dont usually lie to each other about a man. take what she says seriously.

Ok if the same neighbor's keep complaining, just turn your music down a little or tell them to leave their dorm rooms if it's during day time. If it's during night time, then I guess they have the right to be complaining against you.<br>  <br>  P.S.

678d9cc579426e12823a20c07071309aaa	Its funny that you start on this topic. It depends on how far apart you are. I am in Australia and I have had a long distance relationship with a latin girl in America for over a year, we never met each other though... If you never met the other person, it is especially hard. On the net they are one person, but in real life, its a whole new story. My advice to you is of course do everything you can to meet that person (but think twise or more wether its worth it or not).<br>  <br>  If you think that there is something that you need and you are sure that there is nothing better, then why waste your time, go out of your way to get it, but if you are in doubt, even in the slightest one, DONT. Otherwise you will just hurt yourself ... believe me. That girl I was dating "online" ended up cheating on me with a "real" person (lol it sounds rediculous, but it didn't at that time), , but hey we are friends now.  So whatever you decide, good luck.

VeDJa0m9aa	It sounds like you were trying to make him jealous. That is a no-no when trying to make points. It is such a turn off  for a guy to hear about another guy. Don't do that! Try playing 20 questions with him. Ask about 5 questions at a time to get him to open up. Just be prepared to answer his questions also. I had a long distance relationship also. It was hard to express yourself by emails only. But once we got together, we couldn't stop talking. BTW, we ended up getting married. There is hope....|`|C59bTKO2aa	I am bothered by the fact that he does share more intimate details with you.  It seems to me that if he wanted to build up a relationship with you that he would tell you more about himself to see how you would respond.  If you tell him about a guy and he ignores what you said, then he either doesn't know what to say or he just doesn't care.<br>  <br>  The next time he visits and you see him say, "Wow, just realized how much I've missed seeing you!"  He should respond that he's missed you too with obvious sincerity.  If he doesn't, well, just assign him to the friends list.|`|kHRD7uUAaa	you know that's the oldest trick in the book and not all of us guys fall for that so that might be why he didn't respond.  The other answer would be that he don't care who you see so stop beating around the bush about it just ask him if he is interested that way you won't be wasting your time on him.|`|4zVi6gvgaa	He could feel weird about it, or just doesn't know how to react. The fact that he said absolutely nothing certainly makes it seem that he's jealous of this guy, but you can't jump to conclusions. next time you see him in person, mention it and see his immediate reaction.|`|AA11391968	The simple fact that he is continuing communication with you via e-mails and visits, tells me he is interested in you.  He doesn't want to buy into the "new guy" stuff because he is not near you any longer.  So there is nothing he can do.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	it is better if you can stop mailing for some time to observe. you need a life partner to share you in all through out your life in all aspects. pray god to bless you one whom he likes [leave the selection to god]. you will be blessed with|`|w6v8JnBAaa	I would be inclined to think he isn't interested in anything other than being email friends at this point. If he did want more you'd think he would have said something, anything, about the other guy but, he didn't so he doesn't want to discuss your personal business or apparently his. Also, you said he doesn't flirt much...Big clue...he isn't interested in you like you are with him. This doesn't mean you should stop talking to him...things could change ya know! <br>  Good luck, sweety!|`|AA11695632	For love matters it is always a good practice to talk straight to the person without complicating the matter by all other means as it always backfire and things get spolied on that. <br>  <br>  If you feel good for him , tell him you feel great for him and has falled in love with him and is this the way he too feels on you. make it short and simple and move on with the answers.|`|FyvrWG6laa	He was not affected at all and thats a good sign he is still into you, the fact that he replies to your emails is something you ought to be grateful for, you could have wondered if he didn't reply right? and thats enough sign of trouble.

Either he is not interested in you romantically, OR he is just not up for a relationship because he has to work out some things himself first.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Honestly, if you really want mature advice from someone has has experienced all this crap...<br>  <br>  He's not interested.  If he were interested in your love life (or becoming PART of your love life), he would ask about it.  Even if he was shy, he would poke around a little "That guy sounds lame" or "Sounds like you like that guy", etc, etc.<br>  <br>  You have a nice friend that you can e-mail and talk to about all sorts of stuff...  But he doesn't want you to know about his personal life, and he doesn't want to hear about your personal life either.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	Maybe he isn't interested in a relationship like you are.

I'm not saying you are being self destructive but I was and maybe parents see it that way also.<br>  This might sound stupid and it sounded stupid to me before but another reason parents don't like it is with piercings comes an image. That image is usually relating to self destructive things like drugs and most parents don't want that to be portrayed on their child.<br>  I'm not too against it but I see why parents don't like them.|`|e3xzMnuHaa	sometimes parents just feel that there children cant make a descision for themselves which i personally dont believe in but parents just really dont want their children to grow up sometimes and as well they dont think its neccessary for their children to be getting piercings no matter how mature they are.|`|3n0hXTt7aa	thats funny...im 16, and my mom told me "NO PIERCINGS ON YOUR FACE!!! keep it all on your ears."<br>  so now i have 14 piercings (total; 7 on each ear).

Seriously, I can't really say exactly what love is. Love is just a feeling that gets into you, becomes a part of you, and changes the way you look at life. Love is not selfish, it's giving. Love is comforting and fulfilling. When you love someone you want the best for them, you want to see them happy, you feel not only that you would like for this person to be a part of your life, but you can barely remember what life was like before this person.|`|X5W3leICaa	I feel like Im loving someone the most when I am holding her (GF) in my arms and kissing her. When I tell her I will do things, I do them. When I promise things to her, I would move heaven and earth to keep it. She lives 8 hours from me and I would never get sick of traveling that distance to see her. If its true love, sex, distance, looks, etc. are the most miniscule thing. If they think its their worst day (looks wise) ever, they still look like hte most beautiful person to you. I feel loved by my (GF) cause out of all the girls I have dated, no one has kissed me the way she does. Love is a complicated emotion, feeling, etc. The person you love becomes apart of you, and no one else can make you happier. Their happiness makes you happy. You wonder why this person couldnt always be in your life because of how much (Positively) they have changed it. True love is realizing everyone has flaws, even yourself, and falling in love with the positives as well as the negatives. Getting through the rough spots and making your relationship stronger than it was before. It can bring you to the highest point in your life and it can bring you to the lowest point. It can bring the worst out in people and it can bring the best out in people. Love is unique because you cant go looking for it, you find it in the places you least expect to find it in. When they are gone, you wish you were with them, when you are with them, you wouldnt give it up for anything in the world.|`|5agXk9ldaa	hi dear<br>  well love is not word it is an attitude<br>  when you love someone deep, you feel like he is another part of you, you become jalous and you feel like you want to succed so that she/he can see you a winner, you miss him/here a lot. if something wrong happens to her.. <br>  and you feel like you really can die for her/him|`|qOOU1EVlaa	love to me is..wen u see dat person u smile even though u jus finishd cryin..jus seein that person smile will make ur day..but if dere sad..u feel like u wanna cry with him..his tears r my tears..his smile is my happiness!..dats wat i think love is..:(..but love hurts most of the time|`|GrCj35muaa	well this is my experience, I haven't seen my bf in 6 months, (he is deployed) and I love him even more now then the day he left.

It lists a book that is really good at explaining how to make love work:|`|bitKsIPkaa	I think love is nothing, yet everything.<br>  It is an extremely complicated feeling that varies from individual to individual. It carries with it many others. Sorrow, Happiness, Jealousy, Pride, Strength, Trust, Honor, and so many more. Love to me is something so deep that words fail miserably to describe it. It can bring you to your greatest heights, and it can knock you to your deepest lows. It's not something that everyone obtains. It's often misused and abused, both literally and figuratively. It is the most important and least important. Most important when you have it and it is true. Least important when you don't have it. You cannot search for love, for it searches for you. It's a delicate thing. A single misplaced word can launch a chain of events that lead to it's demise. I think that love is not something that can be learned. I think love is something that is born into you. One who lacks the ability to love lacks a great thing indeed. Love is a beautiful thing. From the sweetest of kisses between a pair of teens to the loving embrace of the aged. Love is life. It makes our world go around. Without love there would be no me, no you, no us. There would be no life. No music. No art. No poetry. There would be little color in our bleak world, for what brings something to life more than one's love for it? Nothing. That's what. <br>  <br>  That's what I think love is.|`|LHnVjJqsaa	BABY DONT HURT ME!!!

You can definitely start planning the wedding immediately, and the best place to start is budget!! Many couples get caught up in the other exciting details of planning a wedding that they forget the most important foundation-- setting and trying to stick to a realistic budget. From that step you would most likely want to start with planning the logistics of the wedding, such as the date, the number of guests, the overall ideas and plans for the wedding ceremony and reception, and then get to the individual things. If you can afford a wedding planner and have limited time, I would highly recommend it. If not, don't worry, there are many websites and books to help you manage the large task of planning a wedding yourself. www.theknot.com is a great place to start!!!|`|kNLi16C6aa	Men don't get engagement rings. Just a wedding ring.<br>  <br>  I would start with a date, when you want to get married. How long do you think you will need to plan everything, pay for it all, etc.<br>  <br>  When you have your date, you know then what season you need to plan for - ie, is it a winter or spring wedding. From there you can decide the venue, Venue should be done early so you know how many people fit in the venue, whether the date you want to get married is available etc. Then from there you arrange everything around that...get flowers and photographers that are close to the venue. <br>  <br>  There are alot of wedding planning magazine...even bridal shows that will help you.|`|bSChe6Tgaa	It depends on what you guys prefer. Most of the time the guy doesn't get an engagement ring but that doesn't mean you can't give him one. I think it is wise to start planning a wedding soon after the engagement it also depends on the kind of wedding you are having.If it's small then the planning of course wont take as long. Always allow yourself plenty of time to get things done. Weddings can be stressful and it's important to have time for you and your partner too. I started out with making a list of ppl I wanted at my wedding. Knowing the amount of ppl attending will help you find out how big the place is that you want it at and the number of items you need for the wedding. Give yourself a few tasks every week so that you stay on track. It would also be smart to think about colors too cause that is very important in putting together a wedding :). Good luck!|`|WfMXn9hMaa	men don't get engagement rings.  How soon you start preparations depend on how far off the wedding date is.  I think the first things you should do is reserve the church and reception place.  Then you can go about ordering invitations.  The rest of the stuff is pretty easy and fun... picking out your theme color and dresses, ordering a cake, music selections, etc....   Have fun and good luck|`|b1K0Z9yNaa	No engagement ring normally for the guy, although if he really wants one, I say go for it. Then I'd recommend starting with some wedding websites like theknot.com and wedding magazines to decide what kind of wedding you really want.|`|sLwmzvi8aa	okay here is the thing... you don't put a ring on him until the wedding day...<br>  <br>  you have to start with a wedding planner... then go on from there i would personally pick my favorite flower, then color scheme from there... it helps a lot when you already know what colors you want cause then you can find every thing else that goes with that kind of theme...  but you should just start by going into bridal dress shops (just to look) but you have to find that perfect dress that calls your name... <br>  <br>  good luck... i hope every thing goes well  :D|`|7foornMVaa	No, you dont give him a ring. I would say the way to start is to have a budget. Once you know how much you can spend then you can start planning. Location, date, time, guests, food, flowers, dress, tux, parties, and its gonna be mind boggling. I would try and check with a wedding planner and relieve yourself of alot of stress.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Congrats!|`|eeaXYyCNaa	no you don't give him a ring.  not til you get married.  get a wedding planner.

You also develop quite a sense of pride in knowing that you worked so hard! There were sacrifices, I didn't get to go out much, I had to work almost full time while going to school part-time (so it took longer to graduate)...but all in all it was worth it.

A picture is not a way to meet him, and thro friends you will only run into trouble.  <br>  <br>  If he wont ask you to your face, how will you ever talk?  Is he going to take you out to dinner over the phone?  And besides, what if he never even wanted to go out with you, and your friends are just stretching the truth to hook you up?  It happens everyday out by me.|`|AA11240078	i will put in 2 words that is simple HECK NO|`|AA12381717	No!  You don't even know him.  A picture isn't enough.

AA10397284	Angel, I've been in a few relationship in my life, some good, some bad, some I forgot, and some I regret, but I learned a  lot about myself and whole lot about being in a relationship.   I'm a natural flirt myself but I wouldn't act on it, or would I?   I flirt with everybody, the receptionist, the new secretary, the boss' wife, heck I flirt with the security guards too but if I focused my flirting skills to one particular person, then maybe, I want something more, or do I?   See, some girls are flirt proof and it challenges my skills - I can either pull away and forget her or I will keep trying until I get the satisfaction.  This is a very dangerous situation in which I, a person involved in a relationship, wouldn't  put myself into, or would I?   Well, if I knew my girlfriend loves me to death and I knew she wouldn't leave me for anything, then maybe I should try.  <br>  <br>  Bam!   7 year relationship down the drain, now I'm thinking of how much more I could've given her, I could've proposed to her but it's too late, I got too comfortable it feels like back in high school and you don't want your friends to see you with your Mom so you have her drop you off at the corner of the school and just walk.   That's how I felt when I'm with her - and yes I do know I deserved to be dumped.  Now she's happily married, to a very good guy, very lucky guy.  I gave them my blessing when I walked down the isle as a best man.   <br>  <br>  Justin is gonna be your future husband's best man for your wedding and that's all he's going to be.   You deserve better, and don't worry about being 30, you're still young and beautiful you'll find the right guy, believe me, I know.|`|7ab16f0332de8e2ac13f6694005c5914aa	First of all you say you know that he has never cheated on you - how do you know that? Did he flirt with you until you followed him around like a sick puppy? If he did then you know the effect he had on you so what affect do you think he has on other women? If you marry him do you think that this would make him stop flirting with other women? Why do you argue with him about this, if he won't listen  to you ? It is obvious to me that you don't like this behaviour but regardless of how you feel he refuses to change. You are 30 years old and he is older so you are not some love sick kid - or are you?<br>  If he really loves you like you love him then give him an ultimatum  "Shape up or ship out" and then get on with your life because it appears to me that you are being taken for granted and he is just using you!<br>  DON"T BE A FOOL|`|AA10116125	how do u KNOW? professional what? Sorry flirts cheat. Pros cheat. Move on. Well it hasn't been a year yet. U don't even know the guy!!!! Love takes time, a long long time.|`|AA11549317	So you haven't "hooked" him yet. If you can accept his flirting, carry on, if not I suggest you find someone less firtatious.|`|AA11820856	Well it sounds like your caught in his web which helps enthrall his ideology of himself.  So you can either be nice little moth and stand in line in the web or you can go find someone that you don't have to play act when they are in public.  Even famous people let everyone know who their true love is
277d9c136ad9c8738594ec03d963ad13aa	As long as I'm not the reason he is crying, there is something sexy about a man allowing himself to be so vulnerable and so open with me.  In general, men try so hard to keep any weaknesses hidden that when a man trusts me enough to open up, it is a bit of a turn-on.|`|AA11000023	I don't. I actually hate to see a man cry it is so sad.|`|cf15ee26842155c402b89af5999528ceaa	i dont like it when guys cry it shows weakness if anything it turns me off|`|d938c4793610c97378a5325e026e5495aa	Maybe they feel sorry and they want to help them and they get aroused!  <br>  These days men like to hold their tears! they dont want to let it out!  But when they do! its like the depression for them!  Get drunk, sleep, dont care about anything,|`|AA11820856	Hmmmm, I have never seen a woman get horny over a guy crying|`|f1135d39fc86bed7afbc634228ee2aa8aa	Yeah im curiouse to see some of these answers myself
AA11820856	Yes|`|AA10465391	no guy says truth dear......believ me......am a guy|`|3cce235896a7ce194bafdf20393e80c3aa	i aint a boy but i know most boys would never come to terms with it they only like to see our faults. plus there smart enough to know agreeing would just make the girl more agressive|`|b778b3956dc64b9fb4b332d7ec8ae97faa	Yes <br>  <br>  <br>  we should not lie <br>  <br>  <br>  and if we talk on such topic it will make the two very close
AA11909619	the might end up falling for each other|`|AA11820856	Until its a proven fact it is just a rumor and should be seen as the same.  Don't worry about rumors because most are over inflated any way|`|AA10221073	It's best not to get involved or listen to rumors even if they may or may not be true.<br>  <br>  Stir clear of them because it's just a bunch of people talking  about things that is none of they're business anyway.
28a531b2d0a143bd52445ca05e09fff7aa	Well if you knew ,,,,,,,<br>  <br>  It wouldn't be a .<br>  <br>  SECRET , no more <br>  Now would it ~! ???<br>  LOL <br>  ~*~*~*~**~Peace.|`|AA11549317	They are able to put up a very good pretense. If you want to know for sure, you need to hire a PI.|`|AA11820856	If it is a secret you wont know, but they usually slip up somewhere along the line and get caught|`|059eeee3f63499110e2b3a8c02597c97aa	You watch for the signs.....there are plenty of them....|`|26c9516fc7d46815a96ddd6936aa08feaa	If you call both of them and their not home, If they both always have something to do around the time you ask them to go out or something...|`|49e613e1f0d0862199d63d0350ab1a6baa	You don't, hence the "secret" part.|`|AA11909619	you catch them in the act|`|8b4e2d30af900b2e1d4dc5ca7a6a5ea4aa	try saying something offensive about the other person and see the response you get.  if it is defensive chances are yes they are messing around.  it is not a 100% thing but most of the time you can tell.  found out the hard way.|`|AA11123474	They are always smiling and giggling amongst each other and acting odd!|`|AA11889152	if u knew it wouldnt be secert would it?
AA10756728	Sweetie as far as this goes, there is a certain amount that is "acceptable" and certainly there is a level that becomes, um... maybe a problem. In no way should he be on there constantly and ignoring your sexual needs or desires. If that is the case, then I would be out of there! If he does not respond to you by doing something like sitting naked by him and seeing if he will turn the computer off, then you may have an addict on your hands. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong my ex was not a computer person and I was showing him some sites that share sexual stories etc... and well one thing led to another and it worked out to the benefit of both of us. With him, I just had a problem with him masturbating all of the time instead of asking me (he got up early in am). BUT that's  a whole other can of worms.  :-)<br>  <br>  I think you need to analyze the issue and try to figure out if you think it's excessive or not, is it helping or hurting your sexual & emotional relationship? Then once you have done that sit down and talk to him, he should have a concern for your feelings, if not leave him, he's is not worthy of your love. <br>  <br>  Good luck sweetie! Oh, and NO you are NOT crazy!!!|`|AA11418785	I DONT SEE WHY WOMEN MAKES SUCK A BIG DEAL OF THIS IF A MAN WANTS TO LOOK AT PORN OR WATCH IT LET HIM AT LEAST HE AINT OUT CHEATING ON YOU WITH OTHER WOMEN YOU JUST NEED TO GROW UP AND LEAVE HIM ALONE BECAUSE A RELATIONSHIP WILL NEVER WORK IF YOU JEALOUS OVER PICTURES WAIT TILL HE GIVES YOU A REAL REASON TO BE JEALOUS|`|AA12162448	Some guys just can't get enough, or maybe ur not doing ur job.|`|AA12200211	get naked and sit next to him, don't let him touch until he switches off, then douse him in cold water|`|24b7c58645f0000aa9e939639baf8513aa	break up why you standing around listing and seeing that|`|9ff8a839c3228f64cc09802a125de5d7aa	ewww a guy like that doesn't care about a true meaningful relationship with you. he just wants ... eh nevermind.|`|e33268d199d21e657058edeaede73a0caa	well im not a lady but you should be enough for him...|`|de498427eb4e5a4c980ed3bea8d66ffeaa	Oh yeah..I understand where you are coming from. Personally, its kind of wierd and offensive. I would possibly ask him if something is bothering him. But otherwise as long as everything in the relationship is going well, I do not think I would let it bother you. Its somewhat natural for them to do those sort of things. Good Luck.|`|AA11820856	Take a few shots of yourself and send them to him, that might get his attention

So hi to a bunch of people. Most drunks will shake your hand and act like you've been friends forever.

06f2ef5b7ffc8986af1de385c9783707aa	This is never easy but you can look for few signs:<br>  1) If she is staring at you<br>  2) If she is trying to be around you as much as possible<br>  3) If she is hanging out with your friends <br>  4) If she acts differently around you (i.e. she smiles if she didn't oor she stops smiling if she was)<br>  5) If she is blushing in your presence<br>  6) if she teases you (only you)<br>  7) if she is always looking for different ways to be in your company<br>  8) if she hides her look when you are around<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|3dd5d34e8eaf457a1c7b2fb1d5d228ecaa	Instead of waiting to see if a girl likes you, if you like a girl just take the initiative and tell her.  End the viscous cycle!

Nervous is natural, you're suppose to be nervous.  Tell them you're nervous and they will love it.<br>  <br>  Just stop worrying and enjoy their company.  You already understand their signals, they're the same ones you send.  They will pay attention to what you say - They will smile in your presense - they will teach you things about yourself that you don't even know.

AA11454166	I'm going through a similar situation because of things I did years ago.  They never really trust you again. Not fully anyway.  It is always there, waiting for the opportunity to show up and force you to feel guilty about something.  I've been going through this for 13yrs.  It hasn't gotten any better.  Maybe you need to learn from your mistake and move on. I don't know why I stayed,but I wish I hadn't.|`|AA12199970	You really can't.  I had this done to me and I will never trust the other person again.  As far as I'm concerned, they can stay away from me permanently
AA11707323	He's getting sex without strings and adding the seducing thing so it doesn't look like he's using you.  Telling you he's no longer attracted to you is just his safety net so you dont jump to any conclusions.
AA10809514	What are you..... an AIDS Poster Child? Get professional help.
AA12167219	She might have just figured out that she wasn't ready for a committed relationship.  Either that or she didn't love you as much as you thought and just didn't want to hurt your feelings.  The fact that she moved on so fast with another guy would suggest that her feelings for you were a bit less than madly in love with you.|`|AA12381717	It's possible that she left you because she's afraid of a heavy committment.  How do you know she likes this other guy?  Even if she does, that doesn't mean she will start a relationship with him.  She might just be afraid and want to have fun.|`|03e4b11e4df38f1ea26cb88c75a09726aa	it's called "infatuation"...|`|AA10686994	oh i'm sry thats a big loss but she must have been lying to u all that time u were dating!

1UiYpUWiaa	people do stuff like this without knowing how it looks to others: scratch their nose, pick their ears stuff like that.|`|e7AJMIBMaa	this stuff doesn't generally happen so she could mean anything.  I'm guessing that you want us to answer by saying that she is flirting with you or something?|`|7irjCSq2aa	Maybe she had something in her teeth,<br>  Or trying to touch her nose.<br>  <br>  Or maybe, just maybe she was being a bit suggestive.
e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	It sounds like she doesn't love herself.  She sounds as if she needs some type of counseling.|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	They can love you and do those things. Being in love does not mean a relationship will be a healthy one. Damaging loves are the worst because since there is love involved, it is hard to let go. But many things you have posted qualify as verbal or psychological abuse, and none should have to put up with that. There is nothing better than love for one's self, that should guarantee a loving partner that will give you respect, if you give it to yourself first, and then demand it from others.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|Qu7GIg6Haa	It is possible that this "love" is as much love as this particular person can muster up. However it's you who has to decide if this is what you want to settle for. Doesn't look very encouraging on paper... I'd say you should look for better qualities. This person just may not be capable of such feelings.|`|C59bTKO2aa	3-10 are signs that she doesn't love you.  But she is right that you deserve better.  This girl sounds completely self-involved, and what you see is probably the best she can do.  Real love is a give and take relationship and you don't have that with her.  Keep looking, don't waste time on a relationship that has derailed.|`|Rkik3eUuaa	listen baby, nobody is going to change for u. and if your gf and her habits annoy u that much maybe it is better to find another one. and do not forget - u re not perfect either and nobody is going to change for u.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	love means sacrifice. do not expect sacrifice from others. love is sacred.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Every damn one of them what are you doing with someone like that?|`|aaCMNSB2aa	You know what, all these things aren't really any sign of not loving you. Many good relationships had at least 1 or more of the things listed above. But having them all together....? Hmmm.... I mean, it IS signs of negativity and not such an easy relationship to get involved in to. I suggest really thinking about YOUR feeling toward her and make a decision if it's really worth it.<br>  <br>  You may also want to mention her getting some help on her self esteem.<br>  <br>  --Good luck, CutieNiki|`|U8rjbwUBaa	has other boyfriends-compares is nothing but if it bad for you go.ask her to change-for you of cause.tell her you cannot put up with her habits.none of these are signs she do not love you,but your asking,that tells me somethink.just go find mrs right.|`|988cef7150394dd70b851a71d9b84c1aaa	you know what that person doesn't deserve you or the love you are offering to give so my advice would be don't waste your love on someone that don't want it and find someone that is willing on returning the same love.Good Luck|`|CaWf475jaa	NO!  Unless that is how he or she shows his/ her affection.  But it is silly and doesn't make sense.|`|w6v8JnBAaa	Obvious she doesn't care about the relationship:<br>  3. unwilling to make sacrifices (get out of work early, etc)<br>  4. not give you a valentine's day gift<br>  6. doesnt remember the things that make you happy<br>  8. doesnt tell her parents about you<br>  9. is willing to break up with you because "you deserve better"<br>  10. makes no effort to change habits you find annoying<br>  <br>  Things that could be expected coming from a best friend:<br>  1. mention negative things about your appearance<br>  2. when frustrated use you to blow off steam (scold/scream,etc)<br>  <br>  Things that just aren't nice to do:<br>  5. not confide in you<br>  7. compares you against her other boyfriends<br>  <br>  Some people just take their partner for granted. They forget to treat them with respect no matter how long they've been with someone. Some of these things I would NEVER say/do toward my hubby but I might with a brother or sister or close girlfriend. <br>  I assume my brother & sister will handle whatever I say because well, they are my family & are stuck with me for life! & I would hope that my girlfriend would take whatever I say with a grain of salt but when it comes to my hubby...well, he is the one whom, if not happy, will be the first to walk out of my life & I don't want that to happen.

I would express to her that this hurts your feelings. You treat people how to treat you and if you put up with her behavior she will continue to do it. If she is truly your friend, she should understand and make attempts to stop the behavior.|`|d9f55c68ad094b473d9633468c4ed6c4aa	she jealous, you should find a new friend.|`|AA11820856	Maybe she likes it better when your single because then she can spend more time with you.

Shaving creates stubbles as it grows back and that is not comfortable.|`|rMq9D06Faa	I think it looks better when she shaves.  You can better see the contours of her.  A woman's body is a sexy thing!  The more you can see, the better.<br>  <br>  Plus, during oral sex there isn't any hair getting caught in your teeth or tickling your nose (not that I would know from personal experience.) <br>  <br>  :(|`|L8J5nNjDaa	my boyfriend says: its cool, but the landing strip is nicer|`|1qTNn8qnaa	LOL its not the vagina u shave >.< <br>  But yea my guy doesnt care rofl|`|7BvXLBW6aa	Nah it's way more attractive when she doesn't, makes it more natural plus it lowers the chance of getting STDS and warts<br>  <br>  Plus it looks sexy|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	ITS MORE FUN TO EAT!|`|t14Jk1IPaa	At least trimmed a little bit, or shaved right off or landing strip,...but my girlfriend has a "M" right now for my name!|`|6JJUGs7faa	A little shave is ok but i dont want my gf to like shes 8 down there.

I believe it is up tho the gut, and a girl should find out what he likes... maybe a bit Shaved, or all off, or maybe Shaved in a heart shape... who knows...... I just think that at the end of the day he is the one that is going to go down there, and he should like it.....|`|BYmUFXE3aa	It shows nice! It feels nice! Why not? Besides, everything hairy gives the idea of dirty and smelly! Which is not always wrong!<br>  We men like to watch also! We want to see.what we are playing with! It's just men nature!<br>  Personally I don't like TOO much hair. My gf just leaves some short one and I like it!|`|db7c9026e81fc1f3256aa2c3a017adb3aa	More younger people like it shaved. Trust me. As you get older they dont really care. I mean some do though. Idk. I shave!!! It's more attractive. And when a guy has got to do what a guy has gotta do it doesnt get in the way :)|`|cbt4I1cuaa	yes i like it shaved all the way because im sure you have went down on a guy and the hair gets in your mouth that's a nasty taste so i keep mine shaved and hope the ladies do to any ways its sexy|`|HDgT1Jscaa	Personally I prefer it when its shaved because it's so much smoother,  it makes oral sex soo much better not to mention the sex just feels better all the way around.|`|XlXDX7XPaa	Yes the well completely shaved  vagina looks very arousing , and you love to do cunnilingus.|`|DyPVKQg6aa	A nice trimming is my preference. Doesnt have to be bald down there but I dont like the amazon jungle down there; it tickles too much lol.|`|wGKBuipYaa	Honestly shaved is just more attractive for me at least, But don't make a big deal about it. shaved or unshaved its not like its going to get turned down.|`|UPQljt4Faa	My boyfriend likes me natural. It is just weird to shave/wax it, and it is more healthy not to as well.|`|Prl63sAnaa	mines a jungle and my man eats it like it's the special at wendy's on friday night|`|cIaqcI8Qaa	dude u seriously took ur head aout of her crotch to respond to this rofl vagina shaved or not still = vagina and no i didnt i memorised my keyboard =P|`|Fi5GJKSKaa	of course i love when a girl shaves her vagina<br>  <br>  cuz its more exciting

Of course I want to know that I will be taken care of as well; but I am willing to work just as much as him to support us both financially.  <br>  <br>  When the song "Golddigger" first came out, my bf would joke about how I was definatiley not a gold digger.

Women aren't interested in money so much as advancing their social status.  They tend to desire men who are higher up the societal food chain than they are, and that typically relates directly to how much money the man has, yet I don't believe the actual amount of money is the real factor.<br>  <br>  As for undying love, I've never met a woman who looks for that in a man.  The more aloof and seemingly disinterested you are, the more they're attracted to you.  If you profess your undying love, they feel like they're put on a pedestal, and they don't want to be worshipped.
TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,magnet for trouble.  Sounds like he is the one with the problem here.  You did fall in love with him.  He just started to get "cold feet".  If he was seriously into you,He would keep on loving you.  It hurts so bad when people cut ties like that.  Letting those we love that we just don't feel it anymore.  And rather than pretending,We end this relationship before it gets too dangerous.  I'm guilty of letting girlfriends go because of this.  Do I regret it each time?  Heck,Yes.  I regret it because these girls loved me for a reason.  And it wasn't "false love" at all.  I could've loved these girls for a long time.  But I had a case of "cold feet".  Also,I had a problem with my self-confidence that I lacked.  I am so so sorry that this friend has hurt you.  Yet,In time,This wound will heal.  And you will love again.  It won't be the same person,But it will be love.  The kind of love you deserve and desire.  And this guy will feel it too.  magnet for trouble,I hope this answer pleases you somewhat.  And if not,I am terribly sorry.  You have yourself a goodnight and take care.  Bye for now.|`|SCFD8AFJaa	Omg you guys shouldn't have talked like that because at some point this was going to happen. Either you or him would start to have real feelings. And it looks like he did. I think you should not have said no to prom since you are saying you have mixed emotions. You should have said yes and you would find out during prom if you really liked him or if you could see yourself with him. But my advise is to say you are going to prom as friends. That is if you can still go.|`|A6z0qtOiaa	wait i dont get what your saying?<br>  if you r trying to say that you really do have feelings for him then you should tell him that!!<br>  But! does he have feelings for you?<br>  and it doesnt matter if you cant see your self with him or you dont look cute togeather!<br>  as long as you are both happy then it doesnt matter!!<br>  i hope that helped!!!|`|X39HuK6Vaa	so let's get this straight<br>  you like him...<br>  the first thing you should do is to apologize to him sincerely and tell him what you really feel, and this time it's for real, no jokes and no playing around. God bless you|`|Xi2lGjKyaa	tell him u dont lie to him before this  and u relationship is true in same time u cant go out with before u feel uncomfortable|`|nJanBmEqaa	I know what you mean. I'm in his situation right now.<br>  <br>  My (still best friend) and I were together for awhile on-and-off but then he decided "he didn't like me like that anymore" but he's a big flirt and always acts like that (the whole 'babe' stuff) in his own way. Unfortunatly, I still love him.<br>  <br>  False hope does suck, so i'm sure he is hurting. Honestly, I would tell him exactly what you just put. That you did mean it when you were calling him babe, and (if you want to be all honest) that you do love him. BUT that parties aren't your forte' ....Hopefully it all works out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck.<br>  ~.Olivia.~|`|q18xpBpPaa	i have had alot of guy bff's in my life and i am soo proud of u even tho i dont kno u that u made that decision because ive made that mistake and when "romance" enters the relation ship it'll never b the same again.|`|4BoteYDwaa	Just go out with him. What are you afraid of? I'll never understand why girls are so afraid to let us take them to dinner and a movie.|`|wdUhwD61aa	You strung him along. This guy has feelings for you, he thought you liked him in that way back. Turns out you can't see him that way. Well, that's ok, you don't have to see him like that. But you can't expect for him to hang around in the same way. He ripped himself from you because he just got "dumped" (or the equivalent?) Let him move on.|`|egYNGvidaa	aw, hun thats sux. :[<br>  try telling him what u feel.<br>  like u guys make great friends, but it won't work actually being together. <br>  good luck!|`|tR36oILvaa	awww, i feel sad for you too. :(|`|FLJCEvvXaa	whats so wrong with having a guy as a best friend? <br>  maybe you should make it clear you ARE just friends, and prom is supposed to be a celebration, so why NOT celebrate it with a friend? tell him you DO love him, but more like a brother than anything else. Just sometimes guys, even myself, can see friendship with a girl as something completely different than it actually is. Make it very clear your only friends, and if he cant accept that, than you need to re-evaluate your relationship. whats so wrong with going out with him in the 1st place? if you love him, and he likes you, isnt that a good thing?<br>  <br>  hope i helped. *y!a hug*

And by the way, girls are NOT ONLY attracted to guys with money!! Girls like a boy with a nice smile, who treats them with kindness and respect.

You should know what you need to be happy and not settle for less, just because you don't want to be alone.

They don't have much to do with love in the end.|`|UDInHk0jaa	Both.  If you are in love or marry for security, you are without passion...you settled.  If you are in love or marry for passion (aka true love) you have the happiness of an unconditional bond, but without security the road is tough.  You can always acquire security, but you just don't acquire true love.  Most important is communication.|`|JfeLb2Ptaa	By security, do you mean to feel safe in the relationship? Or do you mean that it is a sturdy relationship and "secure"? <br>  I would say passion. If you are in a relationship for the security, then you are missing out on a whole bunch. I guess it might also depend on the person. Some people might be cool with missing out on passion. I would not. Passion is sooo exciting.|`|PbPiF2p3aa	When I was young I thought it was passion. As I am older now and have been around the block a few times, I know it is security. Passion fades in every relationship and turns into quite comfort.

So you can have beautiful scenery and good drinks to get the conversation flowing. If you are not 21 yet go to a casual bistro or coffee shop. Maybe miniture golf. You don't want to go somewhere too isolated just in case you have nothing to talk about you can talk about all the crazy stuff happening around you. I hope this helps a little. First dates are always nerve wrecking....

IesiHHdxaa	you know what, I agree completely. I have seen this happen too and it really makes me mad!!! For crying out loud, these people have lived longer than and in some ways are probably smarter than the people that do that to them. <br>  <br>  Anyway to answer your question, I believe it is because some senior citizens aren't able to take care of themselves, and when they can't do that, there's just this thought that they can't control their lives and have to be babied (which in many cases to me is ridiculous). I know that there are some people who have alzheimers or some kind of thing going on where they do need to be babied a little bit but other than that yeah it's pretty bad. Basically, it's easier for younger people to treat senior citizens like that because they sometimes have more control over them. If a senior citizen wants to eat something they're not supposed to for whatever reason, they are told they can't have it, and the senior citizen protests. after protesting for an extended period of time over many instances, it can get old for the senior citizen and their reactions start to appear more childish. the people telling them they can't have/do/eat that certain something respond by treating them like a child because that seems like the appropriate response after seeing them act like they do. but yeah it's crazy. if that younger person wanted something, there wouldn't be too much in their way of getting it and if there was something in the way as much as they are to those senior citizens they probably would start acting like that too (unless they really seriously couldn't have it because it is detrimental to their health). senior citizens should be treated with respect for all that they have gone through in their lives, and not treated like children by giving them candy and other petty childish things as rewards/consolation for tasks or other various things.

Skinny jeans on guys are hott:)|`|dFHsAXDMaa	as a mother of 4 kids 17, 15 ,14 and 11  my best advice is ignore his dumb ***.......it he realizes he is not bothering you he will eventually stop. just be you and know you are perfectly fine the way you are. If he wants to play football let him and be smelling let him. my boys are 14 and 11 and my 11 yr old is you  and the 14 yr old is your brother.. 1 1 yr old does his hair spikes it will gel showers without being told to... snow boards  is always outside riding bike etc.... his brother is the lazy one you have to remind to shower.... my daughters who are 17 and 15 are completely different too...<br>  <br>  you will wake up one day about 6 years from now and you will have your brother and best childhood friend back and everything will be cool|`|4Wu660ITaa	he is a little brother( i have one so i know what i am talking about.) he wants attention. and he sounds like he doesn't know the difference between good and bad attention. try explaining to him that there is a difference between the two. and second try spending time with him. i know that this sounds like a stupid answer but it works, I spend a couple minutes a day with my little brother(just asking him how his day was and listening to the answer.) and it really helps.

cac9ed8d435293fc97f875ef9f5c1552aa	Because you must be in love or on something that is very uplifting to ask a question like that.<br>  <br>  Well the heart sign is as old as , , , , , and . Its meaning for the people living in Europe before the last Ice Age of course is not known, but since these Cro-Magnons were hunters one can be reasonably sure it meant that life sustaining organ pumping around the blood of the organism every second of its lifetime. <br>      Graphically  is related to , the sign for fire and for flight in the Middle Ages, and one of the most common signs in Western ideography. It is also related to , Aries, its graphic counterpart among the open sign structures, and to , for union or togetherness. <br>      It is probable that  began as , a pictorial sign for the heart of a man or an animal. Nowadays, at least in Sweden,  is associated with the behind and defecation, as it is an old sign for a toilet for both sexes. <br>      The heart does not appear in any established sign system. It is an anarchistic graph that has yet to find a place in any conventional sign system. Nontheless it is well known throughout the Western world as a sign for togetherness or love, especially sexual love, making love, affection and so on. <br>      One sign that is often associated physically with  is , the arrow, a symbol for directed energy, flow, penetration. <br>      Other ideograms that often appear together with the heart, for instance on posters for public events, and in advertisements of sales, are  and . The combination stands for party, festivities, happiness, and favorable opportunities. <br>      In connection with these fivepointed star signs, it is interesting to note that  is a variation of the Arabic sign for the number 5. <br>      The heart sign appears as a symbol in all the major cultural spheres. In the Christian trilogy of faith, hope and charity  stands for charity as the anchor cross stands for hope. It also appears with a religious or positive meaning among Aztecs, Hindus, Buddhists, Muslims, Jews, Celts, and Taoists. <br>      In ancient Greece the heart sign (together with the flower) was related to , the lyre, the attribute of Eros, the god of sexual love, around 600-400 B.C. Later, the attribute of Greek Eros, his Roman counterpart Amor, and even Cupid (Latin = desire) was changed to the bow and arrow. On a Greek amphora from around 500 B.C. one can see  used as leaves of a wreath placed on the head of Dionysos, the god of wine and feasting. <br>      The heart sign is also used in Africa: see  and . <br>      In early heraldry it is not uncommon. It is found, for example, on the coat of arms of Magnus Ladul?s from the thirteenth century, a Swedish king known for his work to ensure the safety and sanctity of women, and to put an end to the habit of knights and soldiers to take what they wanted from the peasants. <br>      To find graphical opposites to the symmetric, soft, closed  one has to look for the simplest of those structures that are asymmetric, straight-lined and open, with crossing lines, like  or . The graphic opposition is mirrored by a corresponding semantic opposition. One would hardly imagine Hitler using  as a symbol of his Nazi movement. <br>      The biggest banking corporation of the world, the Japanese D.K.B. has chosen the heart sign for its logo in the form .|`|b0fb1bdf8cd75fbaf3490514620e0c59aa	Because you cannot live without your heart and love is like your heart keeping you alive without it you will die.|`|e6cb699a7caf3c4893f575e1de486bf4aa	i have no idea but if your going to ask that y do we call blue blue and green green or a square a square it just habit and well and what our fore father have layed out we cant change it just is but as for the question u asked well when u feel like u have lots someone really dear to you your chest starts to hurt cos the love u have for that person is there and not just in ur head and u can die from a broken heart not proven i know but it really hurt when u lose a love especial someone so close to u

AA10494978	He needs to stop treating her right now.  He should know better, as a therapist, to get involved with a patient.  Remind him of that.  <br>  <br>  If he doesn't have enough respect for his wife to not mess around, (which it sounds like that is where he is going with it or where he would like to go with it) remind him of the penalty for getting caught with a patient and jeopardizing his practice.  <br>  <br>  Ask him what he thinks for this scenario.  Patient goes for PT.  Patient starts flirting with care provider who is married.  Patient and care provider "hook up" for a night of drunken lustfest.  Next morning, patient feels guilty, cries rape and says she was drugged.  Now, can your brother picture his life after that?

Sounds like your brother is entering male menopause. Ya there is such a thing. That's when men start acting like fools and think they can stay young and be a hot stud with a young woman in their bed.<br>  <br>  About going to the bar this woman works at. Tell him let's take his wife to the club with you and maybe the cute little girl who works at the bar might serve you your drinks.
OtqB24NVaa	man or women...it dont matter. Everyone LOVES to just lay back and feel good while someone else puts in all the work|`|hhRDjIvZaa	It's alright, I guess. I don't think most women crave it like guys do, though.|`|K8j3ufTSaa	the answer lies solely in the one giving such oral....a good partner makes ALL the difference. A woman's oral orgasm, when performed correctly, can be more intense than an orgasm from sex. If you are seeking tips on how to do it correctly, first- work with a woman that knows how to have an orgasm. It is really hard when both of you are stabbing in the dark. and secondly- communicate, communicate, communicate!|`|RMq1cKBNaa	I don't like it. I've never tried it though, but to me it's gross. <br>  If I can't put a coconut in my mouth, I'm definitely not going to put a dick in there.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	I have never liked it. I like giving oral to my bf, but I will not receive.|`|dHH4Rl2yaa	I love it!
1rmSuG2Haa	Oh god.. yes, that was a tad redundant for her to keep insisting on HER point of view.<br>  <br>  But let me tell you (as a woman) what I think she was doing..<br>  <br>  She was jealous of her and/or trying to make herself feel above the girl, and got a bit upset when you wouldn't play along and agree with HER. The way she sees it is that the girl is young and inexperienced and therefore, she feels entitled to belittle her for her own sake of maturity and self-worth.<br>  <br>  Are you attracted to the 17 year old? Do you know her personally? Does your g/f feel jealous of the way she looks, acts, status or her fiance? Try to get to the root of why she would be jealous of the girl in any way.. <br>  <br>  and there you'll have your answer as to why she kept persisting with this. Most girls are very competitive with other females. Most don't like to see another female have what they don't.. (of course some women can rise beyond that though)<br>  <br>  She really just wanted an ego fluff -- you to tell her "you know, you're right. She'll never make it! She'll never be happy for too long. Its all doomed to fail."<br>  <br>  But you didn't and you kept an open mind..<br>  <br>  Good for you for not bending or compromising your beliefs.. stay firm. =)|`|GEydJTyyaa	my mom was 17 when she married my dad ,they just had their 40th anniversary.|`|RMq1cKBNaa	i'm sorry, but that was extremely long.|`|mK0cakU9aa	Good luck Findiing an idiot that will read alll that.|`|BbRewQjQaa	She is trying to get you to agree with her opinion.|`|9ZtXU9Nuaa	wow that was extremely long<br>  i guess you did the right thing <br>  from what i picked up :)<br>  good luck and seriously 17 is too young to be getting married when youve only bee together for like 3 months <br>  sorry|`|i88wWUdLaa	She's totally ignoring what you're saying! Wtf..? Anyways. Girls can be like that sometimes. Start getting used to it... lol.|`|ilzSv9Ltaa	Sounds like she is jealous or she wants you to say that you would want to marry her and it would last. Just ignore it:)|`|Ju57sA1iaa	woah. i read all of that and i don't see you point. Sorry.|`|p6zDSNnVaa	who's the arthor of this book?|`|D7KwEaoXaa	She doesn't sound cold at all :)<br>  <br>  She is talking to you like she would talk to her closest friends, she thinks it's crazy! She's focused on it, and wants to talk about that one subject for a while. Women do this :)<br>  <br>  You are thinking like a guy here :) You think a girl asks a question because we want an answer. We just want to express what we think on the subject. We'll go on and on saying the same thing 20 different ways. It's what we're focused on at the time. <br>  <br>  She didn't seem unhappy with your answer at all, in fact she said you had a good point, and brought up some examples she knew to support what you were saying. She was hoping you would at least guess a time frame, since that was the game she was playing in her head. You didn't play along since you thought it might actually be able to work out, and she was fine with that since you actually gave her your opinion finally. She just wanted you to open up and speak your mind about a subject she had an interest in. You eventually opened up, and she was happy with it.<br>  <br>  This same conversation with another girl? Can you bleieve it? No way!! Yes it's true!! That's Crazy!! I KNOW!! Do you think it will last?? It's pretty impossible! Well it might though... You really think so?? It's pretty hard to imagine, but it happens. Yeah I guess it does, I still think it's crazy though! Yeah, pretty crazy :)|`|GrCj35muaa	She wasn't looking for your opinion, clearly you didn't feel right deciding a random couples fate and I agree with you. She just wanted you to say she was right which she isn't. It's not up to her to decide such a thing either nor unless she owns a Delorian with a Flux Capacitor, there is no way she knows this couple's fate. I wish them the best of luck and the same to you too.|`|yusoItg9aa	"their" means belonging to them - "there" is a location & a comma is a very useful piece of punctuation.  There is no issue here - she wanted you to agree with her and you had a conversation.  IM is killing grammar.
07YBD5mJaa	It's normal.<br>  "Down there" is a very sensitive area, private.<br>  you'll get used to it eventually.|`|AA12346188	Are you male or female?|`|kUZEYNmNaa	A lot of women including me don't like getting oral sex. The reasons can range from just not liking the sensation to just not being overly fond of having tounge wriggling around my vagina.<br>  <br>  So if you just don't like it there's nothing wrong with you its just a personal preference. Just tell your bloke your happy to give it but don't want him doing it anymore.|`|g7RnYMoNaa	I think it is because this is not the natural way of doing it. Your nervousness is natures way of protesting.|`|fk8wXA3Saa	Try going 69 you both will be too busy to worry !|`|rMq9D06Faa	Body issues?<br>  Afraid of no orgasm (and him being hurt)?|`|GrCj35muaa	it would help to know your gender. but if you are female, try taking a shower and shaving just before you think/know you might receive oral sex and it should help you knowing everything is up to par down their, if you are male, make sure you keep your genitals clean and if she asks, let her know when you are finishing. if you are fresh and clean you shouldn't have any reason to be nervous, also just be yourself, it will turn your partner on to see you enjoying it.|`|5BIIG6Qwaa	Are you afraid you will fart in their face? Relax and enjoy it. Maybe one of your parents did it to you when you where younger and you are suppressing it. It could be a lot of different things but it is still up to you. If you don't want it then you have to say so.|`|6ISp4Hgcaa	idk but thsi one girl i offered it to said no.  i think its something you have to get comfortable with maybe get a little older. not sure what else to say.  i dont think most guys would mind anyways.  i masturbate enough not to even need sex so i just have a girlfriend|`|g1ciF3DVaa	i'm guessing it's normal to get nervous.<br>  <br>  you probably just have to get used to it, how many times have you received oral?|`|RMq1cKBNaa	Oral is disgusting|`|qIM2LtVzaa	If you haven't had it before/a lot then that's where the nerves come from. its weird to have some ones face down there. no worries just relax next time and try not to think and the nerves will go away.|`|CSryVJFdaa	Just relax when receiving oral sex and enjoy it don't think too much about it.|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Don't worry its a normal thing. Maybe you just scared of hurting him. Who knows!|`|9Ht6M77Raa	Do you orgasm during regular sex? If not then this is probably too much pressure because you don't know how to be or what to do.If you don't orgasm through reg. sex then hey* this could be the answer just try to relax and figure out what feels best and  go with it. Don't be shy about telling them what feels good and do the same with your partner. If the issue of nervousness is also shyness communicating with what feels good to each other will help break the ice. Have you given oral sex to your partner?|`|0cb8e28e25153f99663391d4bd8ec655aa	Most of us have been raised with a strict set of morals with some type of religious up bringing. First of all are you old enough to be having such serious relationships. If so then you may have been taught that these things are wrong, so if it doesn't feel good then don't do it. Follow your heart and do what makes you feel good it will make you happier in the long run! People should wait till they are older to engage in serious types of relationships.<br>  If you are old enough then you'll need to feel good about what you are doing. If you are in a long and committed relationship then it will work its way out.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	Not sure if u r m or f, but yeah, I know what you mean!<br>  <br>  I'm male and it's taken so many years to actually enjoy oral and not feel guilty!<br>  <br>  I think it's to do with upbringing.<br>  <br>  My GF was the same, but she has now relaxed and accepts what I do to her quite willingly, but she used to push me away!<br>  <br>  It's to do with what we are told when we are kids, like those parts of your body are dirty or similar. Of course, if you are religious it's even worse, the things you are told. Like you'll go to hell if you do that!<br>  <br>  Enjoy it! It;s just about the most personal thing you can do with someone else and if you love someone, the it's even more beautiful.|`|AicQ9LdEaa	Many men and women alike have this happen to them.  Usually it's hidden fear that their partner won't like the smell, taste or your reaction to the activity.  Just relax and take in the moment.  The nervousness is robbing you of the enjoyment.  Also, you will have much less of an issue with this if you just talk it over with your partner.  Communication is the key...|`|X2w5pDp3aa	its bcause ur not used to it and mostly is cauz of how u think uur partner will be tninkin and ya p*** he was the one who was supoz to make u feel confortable by takin wit u b4 havin it. so dnt worry may b one day he'll knw dat hez supoz to tak or do anything dat will make u comfortable. or u'll get used to it|`|DAHBFQx6aa	It could be that you're not exactly comfortable with your body.. I've never really heard of anyone being nervous receiving it. Just relax and focus on the feeling rather then what he's lookin at or thinkin. As long as he's makin u feel good... nothing else should matter. lol|`|5Wd6sIqbaa	Then don't do it, or just think about it in a way that will make it not feel so uncomfortable, think about it in a way that it will feel right.<br>  <br>  Help me: <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au5029ZYrit1zSug90nai2zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222222716AAQKaVx">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0Ee8r5KRaa	you probably have strong feelings for the guy and don't want to ruin things with him...<br>  <br>  so just relax and enjoy. he oviously loves you and wants to give you oral|`|pvDVFrKwaa	Thats a really personal and open thing i know id feel uncomfortable to the point where i was like no and it comes from not being 100% comfortable with the person and possibly not fully trusting them.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	Maybe you're not ready for it.

It doesn't matter if he's big because a girl can only fit so much and if it's too big it might hurt her. <br>  <br>  depending on the woman she might like a man who;s 4 inches or 8. my boyfriend is about 7 1/2 and I can't fit him all the way in but he's very good in bed and we enjoy each other sexually..<br>  <br>  I would, however, stay with him if he were smaller. A few of my exs had smaller penis' but our breakups were unrelated. <br>  <br>  Some girls are shallow and will say 'bigger is better', but all that matters is that you and your partner mesh sexually and that your size matches what she needs.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Eight inches is waaay above average, and in my opinion is too big to be enjoyable. Five to six inches is best for me, I'm tiny.|`|GrCj35muaa	I asked this same exact question to show my boyfriend that chicks don't care as long as it is used right.|`|nFOllgtDaa	Not a reason to break up with a guy.

Yes. The men I've dated that were really small, usually made up for it in other ways like being great at oral, and being freaks in bed by doing me in so many different ways, using toys etc that made up for their lack in size.|`|3hSHkgtYaa	8 inches is not average the average size of a penis is 5-6 inches. I am sure this question was meant as an ego boost, so pat yourself on the back, yes you have a big c**k...happy?|`|3TMr2TMDaa	Not really.  Its the way you use it.  Most of the time.  For a small percent of women, it does matter.  I'd say 10% of all women (guess)|`|tP7HHnD2aa	I am not gay but i still want 2 points for answering this question. Size matter lol.|`|e7sPlIogaa	you are your  own person, size doesnt matter|`|VlTyziH7aa	Size matters sometimes, but more importantly, it's what you do with your size. If there was a guy a little more on the smaller side, I might giggle on the inside but I wouldn't turn him down. If there was a guy on the larger side, I would be internally impressed, but I wouldn't tell him that. I wouldn't leave a guy just because of his size.|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	just imagine when shes with her girlfriends talking bout their boy's' coks. she will have to say "3.5 inches" and be laughed at.|`|tfkHZXYTaa	well first of all i have a 6 and a half,,  and the avg penis size for men is 5 in<br>  you do have a over sized penis kinda..\\<br>  and yeah  do the ladies really care about size|`|ztb7OCvyaa	1. Yes, it really matters. But it doesn't make or break a guy either way. It will feel different with a guy below average than it will with an average guy or a large guy. But just because a guy is large doesn't mean he's automatically a good lover, conversely, just because a guy is small it doesn't mean he's automatically a bad lover.<br>  <br>  2. It would depend on what sort of a partner he was. If he were insecure and hung up on it I don't think I could stay with him. If he were comfortable with himself and still capable of being attentive when we were intimate I'd stay.|`|75SSAFsPaa	oh i won't yell. although it seems to me sometimes that guys are more worried about size than women are made out to be. and as a woman, i say there is such thing as being too big- not to play tmi but i was with a guy that shall we say well-endowed and it hurt! So to answer your questions- 1. size is not as important to me as much as personality and how he treats me. 2. if the guy was perfect in every other way i.e. nice, sweet, not a player then yes i would stay- because there are other ways to be satisfied in bed.|`|FzFSzilmaa	of course size matters... the more meat, the more positions, the more fun... ;)<br>  <br>  BUT you have to be able to get it up too... :D|`|jJ9JGCNTaa	Love is love,it shouldn't matter

sHdnHGJ2aa	20 years ago, I was 15 and got pregnant. I didn't tell my parents until I was nearly 5 months pregnant because I was scared of how they would respond.<br>  <br>  I can understand that you are alone and scared and don't know what to do.<br>  <br>  - Killing yourself is not the answer. Really. Call a suicide hotline. 1.800.SUICIDE (784-2433) Talk to somebody who can give you some answers and some guidance.<br>  <br>  - Talk to an adult that you can trust. You still have options but you need to think about what you are going to do.<br>  <br>  - Please try to stop drinking. If you decide to keep the baby or to give it up for adoption, you could do a lot of damage to the baby in utero by drinking.<br>  <br>  - Try to open up to your family, if you really cannot, call somebody that you are still close to, even if they are in another town. You need support right now, mental and emotional. If you are pregnant, then your body is going through a lot of changes with hormones and sometimes it can make it hard to think straight and make healthy choices. Find somebody that you can trust and can lean on. You need that right now more than anything.<br>  <br>  You are NOT alone. Please, call 1-800-Suicide.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	I feel really bad for you. I wish you the best! We have some things in common. I'm shy and I convinced my mom to put me in homeschooling too. I've never gotten drunk or had sex but I've had my share of sucky things. I think that your life will get better. That's what everyone is always telling me. It's hard to believe but you have to try. You're not a loser. You're just trying to find your place. Who isn't? Good luck!!! <3|`|2c8244371ece2e4523b40d2d84fef4b3aa	I would find out who the Jesus of the Bible is ....  pretty easy ... just call out to Him from the privacy of your bedroom ... if you are serious ... He will respond to  you ....   this is not popular advice these days cuz no one even knows that God is the real deal any more .. even though He is .... anyways ... <br>  <br>  If you are pregnant ... put the child up for adoption. No one would blame you ....|`|AA11254601	Suicide is not the answer hon.  Its a hard thing to put your family though and its taking the "easy way out"  Just ask yourself, is it worth it to end your life and throw away your dreams?  you need to tell your mom what is going on with you.  You need to get to the doctor to find out if it is stress or if it is a pregnancy.  AND STOP DRINKING!  That is NOT the answer and will only lead to alcoholism.  Humans are social creatures, and you need to go back to school and show people that you are above that.  A lot of people lose thier viginity to someone when they are drunk.  It happens hun, but is not the end of the world.  I promise you that.  <br>  <br>  As far as what to do with the child if you are pregnant, I can't say what to do about him or her, but remember this:  Having an abortion doesn't make you unpregnant, it just makes you the mother of a dead baby.<br>  <br>  I would seriously consider adoption if you can't keep the baby yourself.  At least that would give the child a chance at life.  But like I said, it could be stress and depression cuasing you to be irregular.  Buy a home pregnacy test for yourself if you can't bring yourself to talk to your mom.  They don't check your age when you buy them.<br>  <br>  I would not assocate with your "friend" anymore.  Not after the past history.  Go back to high school and join a club that is assoicated w/ something you would like to do.  Socialization is what you need, not to be alone drinking in your room.<br>  <br>  Ignore the jerks and surround yourself with freindly people I know its hard. I've had to do it 12 times in my school carrer, but its easier when you find a club to join that includes people that share your interests.  Good luck, hon.|`|y0zxk79Maa	Is it worth suicide? You are not the only one in the world going through something. People who are suicidal are very selfish to me and only think of themselves. You do not realize who really cares until you are gone and once you are gone... you wont ever know. I do not like abortion but before you think about killing yourself, I would rather you have an abortion and ask for forgiveness. Life isnt so easy, you should go back to a regular school so you can meet other people. Get Abortion + Enroll in School = a Happy you (hopefully)|`|ahujYDBdaa	Tell your parents, you dont always need friends to get you through life. Be independant, and by you leaving school shows them that you're not capable of becoming independant, they see you as the girl from elementary school who cant go anywhere without her bestfriend. As for your pregnancy, you must tell your mother soon, and quick before it gets worse. Dont wait; time wont hide it, it will only increase the rate of the problem.|`|EAYv4SCXaa	Well that's no reason to be so hard on yourself. You are only human.....

Your marriage is a more binding commitment but anyone who loves you and I'm sure she does wouldn't ask you to give up such a longstanding friendship without very good reason.  Or she shouldn't anyway.  Ultimatums never bring the desired results.  Making you choose will only make her lose in the end.  Harboring resentment causes a domino effect and it would be easy to resent her over losing friends that you've had that long.  Be open with your friends and let them know what is going on and talk to her too explaining how important it is you stay in touch with them and hopefully you can find a reasonable compromise.  Hang tight... things like this can be worked out but you're going to have to be even tempered and be clear and caring in your communication to both parties.  Don't badmouth either one of them to the other.  Good luck to you.|`|AA12060399	as soon as you give up your best friend you wife will sleep with them. but you did vow to your wife for better or worse stick to your wife. if her request is unreasonable go to counciling|`|a156a8542149aa0f16d8d183bdeb5670aa	its a trust issue?If she trusts you it shouldn't matter who your friends are. if she doesn't trust you get help with your marriage or say bye to the wife|`|e5583587a1d69fd622fcf800333c67acaa	Your woman has to come first my man.|`|AA10186345	Remember your wedding vows?

KvCD7wQMaa	My girlfriend and I were in a similar situation when I joined the Navy. We had been dating three months when I joined and had to go away for 6 months. After that I actually got stationed only two hours away but I was out to sea ALL the time. We probably saw each other once or twice a month. Anyway, communication was key, we wrote emails everyday and I burned through a few hundred dollars worth of calling cards. I made sure she didn't forget about me by sending her flowers and things like that. This lasted about a year and a half total before we got married and moved in together. This was 8 years ago and we are still happily married and just had our first child. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to keep open communication, express your concerns to him but also loosen the reigns a little and if you guys are truly in love then it will all work out. There is no definitive relationship model that you guys have to follow just do what works. If you guys have to talk everyday or once a week then so be it. Just realize that it will be hard to keep expectations for eachother so minimize them.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.|`|cwEO2tGtaa	well it can but many relationships dont.<br>  my current relastionship with my fiance was long distance  at first. it was only 2 hours away but we worked totally different times i seen him once a week for about 5 hours.at a point we broke up for a few weeks because of it we live together now but i can tell you its really really hard you both have to trust each other 100% and communicate all the time.its key. with guys that can be hard even living near.lol but if you both are dedicated then it can work. make sure its 50.50 part in taking the realationship, but i would try to relize the % chance that it may not work  so if you do end the relationship you wont take it so hard. make sure its both ways give and take  you see him one weekend he knows you care and the same for him. and if your still in high school and he is in college you need to put that much more effort because he has partys and new friends and a huge school he might end of thinking its easier to find someone not so far a way so you need to make to effort if you really love him. make sure when you both see each other you plan what you guys do so every moment is awesome and you both will want to see each other again and soon. i hope i helped you can ask me anything else on the same topic ill be glad to help|`|aCILl7ctaa	To be honest, a long distance relationship isn't in your best interest.<br>  <br>  Being in college is one of the best times of your life and you should be going out and having fun, dating around, etc. <br>  <br>  Most long distance relationships don't work out, so the sooner you end it the better.<br>  <br>  You will soon be enjoying the single life.|`|WoltH8VCaa	It's really hard to deal with long distance.<br>  But if you really love him all that much, you should keep it going. <br>  just make sure you trust him 100%.<br>  and he does the same for you.<br>  but if you ever get tired of the relationship and not bein able to see him<br>  then i suggest taking a break and maybe meetin up with him later in the future when hes not all busy<br>  answer mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222205909AAaHDsI">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|VTGm3UNBaa	Alright I was dating my gf for 6 months before I left for college 4.8 hours away. It's a long and boring drive fyi if you ever take it (starbucks = bad. You cannot skip bathroom breaks if you have starbucks for 5 hours!). We are still together 1.5 years later. (that's 2 years total)<br>  Wanna know how it went?<br>  Horrible. <br>  Long distance brings out the worst in people. You don't even realize how detached you grow from them when your that far apart, You argue over things that you don't disagree about because long distance communication is so poor. That nearly broke us so many times. Just remember if you start arguing really think about what your arguing about and how that arguement would go if you two were together.<br>  <br>  Way's to get through it.<br>  Remember to set up a schedule of when to see him. Mine was every 3rd weekend I would go home. You have to keep up the schedule though. That will keep you going. We set up rules in ours too, just to ease the tension that began to grow the longer we were apart. Rules like if I went out I had to have a female friend with me to keep me out of guy trouble, (because even if your drunk or get stupid your friend will keep you from cheating or being an idiot you see? Mine was a female because guys hit on me. Yours would be a female too) <br>  Always remember to go home on special occassions like V-day.<br>  <br>  Always schedule phone time. We always talked everyday for at least 30 minutes. Just told eachother about what we did to keep some sort of communication open. We even started playing games online together just to keep some sort of interaction up when there was nothing to talk about. (we played mmo's like WoW, you could do anything though). <br>  <br>  The main thing is to remember how you felt when you were together. Your feelings will change, but theyll come back when your together again. You just need to remember the golden rules<br>  Don't cheat<br>  Don't lie<br>  Don't hide things<br>  Be aware of the situation and what your saying<br>  Always look foward to your future time together. <br>  <br>  The first 3 months arent that hard. After 4 months though is when I found the trouble getting really bad. After about 5-6 it started getting better again. You learn to cope.<br>  <br>  That's my best advice. It won't be easy, but it is doable. <br>  Good luck.|`|GO46i2l9aa	I am in your spot right now except my boyfriend is about 2000 miles away from me. So we have a 2 hour time difference which definitely doesn't help the situation, but something that I have found is really fun is writing each other letters and actually mailing them. it is so much more personal that emails or texts. and do take the trips to see him or have him come home. You just have to be confident in the relationship becuase 9 months is a long time to have wasted. Just remember everyday how much you love him and how much he means to you.|`|muPVnH4caa	my boyfriend is further away. it sucks really bad but we still talk a lottt like all the time. so its not too bad. i dont know how you could really cope..because truly i dont know how i am lol buttt the at least you have something to look forward to now and then :)<br>  i dont think you should break it off though..if you really are in love with him..waht good is breaking up going to do? youre still going to be thinking about him. you could send each other cute stuff in the mail or get on the webcam or seomthign so its not too bad<br>  but if you can get through this..i think you can get through anything really..distance is tough though..communication is key.|`|rLCx5ljQaa	A lot of people will tell u long distance relationships cant be done. this is true if:<br>  <br>  A - you will never see him again<br>  B - either of you dont fully believe in the relationship<br>  C - either of you do something to make it fail<br>  <br>  long distance relationships are not easy but if you both work hard then you'll pull through.<br>  <br>  communication is important. dont be constantly calling each other but keep in contact (maybe 2 times a week but it varies from person to person). MSN & the odd text message works wonders if u think you're falling behind with ur communication.<br>  <br>  also, you MUST NOT cheat on your partner or all is lost. in fact anything that would normally jeporadise a relationship is magnified by 5 when things go long distance.<br>  <br>  one more thing - trust is pivotal! you'll have to trust ur boyfriend as well as provide reason for him to trust u.<br>  <br>  it wont be easy but just think about the end result an u will pull through|`|PbPiF2p3aa	I was in your shoes when I was in college. I really loved the guy. He was my world. We tried for years to make it work. In the end it did not. I look back on the time I spent with him and have never regretted trying. He was a wonderful person and helped shape my future. Even though we did not stay together I would do it all over again just because I enjoyed his company so much. I no longer have that passion I once felt for him but I will always love him a dear and close friend who brought alot of joy to my life. You will have to deside for yourself what to do but for me it was worth it.|`|A7SCkuvEaa	all of last year i was in alberta working and my wife was in newfoundland, i missed her like crazy. the only thing that helped me was texting, and talking to her as ofte as i could|`|EZkKZtGxaa	you could listen to the song hey their deliah.|`|ogmuEI0jaa	you can meet him once in 15 days or every weekends|`|g32pZrISaa	Only if the sex is good.|`|k3Oztvwuaa	Aww, i feel your pain, i feel it so bad<br>  I'm in pretty much the exact situation, except slightly shorter distance and i dont have a license, but my father goes there a lot.<br>  I only ever get to see her maybe once a fortnight. Its hard, very hard, but i think I'm getting through it.<br>  Just let him know how much you love him, how much he means to you and constantly remind yourself of that. Constant communication gets me through, my girlfriend and i are texting each other all day, which gets me through.<br>  We tell each other everything, and never hold anything back, i trust her with my life and I'm pretty sure she trusts me with hers too.<br>  <br>  It's hard, I'm not going to deny it, the constant heartache of not being with him/her is nearly un-bearable but just remind yourself how important and how much they mean to you, and you'll get through it.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps :)|`|i2kBIb5jaa	Gosh, I wish I was five hours away! It may seem like a lot, but it could be soo much worse. Anyway, make use of the free time you have. Get to know your friends better, and make sure you stay busy. Try something new. Get a webcam, if you don't have one already (he needs one too!). You can always send each other packages with silly things that make you think of each other. That always brightens the day. And of course, see him as much as you can! A five hour drive is totally worth it if it's gonna make you happy :)|`|jxujkcDxaa	Well, I know how you feel. My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years and about 5 months ago he got a job where he's out of town sunday night thru friday night. It's really hard but you learn to enjoy the time you do have together alot more. And having your own space is always nice. I dont know who said this, "Absence makes the heart grow fonder." I always think of that. If you love him and he loves you, you'll make it through it. Good luck.|`|vRFNZb39aa	i ended up marrying the one i waited for. i lived in ontario canada and he lived in florida. now we're together, and the happiest couple i know-not to brag...but its rare a couple actually get along and make things work. <br>  <br>  that's the point-its work and effort to battle the negative feelings being apart brings. but it really CAN bring you closer if you view it right. see the situation as a good way to really miss eachother and appreciate the time you do spend together.<br>  <br>  yes its expensive, and a hassle, but he's worth it..and true love doesn't happen all the time. i say battle it out and make it work. <br>  <br>  talk on the phone and chat as much as you can...keep in eachothers biz and loop constantly...it will relieve you of any insecurities too.<br>  <br>  don't worry, i spend almost every night crying myself to sleep...but now were together and i can look back and say it was such good experience. <br>  <br>  that day will come for you.<br>  <br>  don't take for granted a healthy love between you...its rare!|`|By1DJAUOaa	CAN'T DO THOSE TYPE OF RELATIONSHIPS...

DXkE7Go5aa	Trying to make friends sucks; especially if you’re not naturally gifted like most people. I’m sorry making friends is so hard, I understand how you feel. For now you should focus on your work and friends will eventually come. You don’t know me but friends need to start some where so if you ever need to talk just email me at chicken23498@hotmail.com or message me on myspace. Hope to hear from you :)|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	i feel yer pain. just be yerself|`|tfkHZXYTaa	wtf i dont know how thats possible i make friends on accident...<br>  thats sucks man i hope you make friends really..|`|OJID5JLBaa	tell the people you think are more the type you want to hangout with that your having a hangout party and wanted to know if they can come have pizza and have a good time (no alcohol though)  make invites and pass them to the people while telling them about the hangout. don't act dessprite on getting them to be your friends just be yourself i can tell you one thing if i went to school where you do and was your age i would so love to go and hangout with you.  But I'll be your friend anyway and good luck.|`|xvxtQwV5aa	Be yourself, loosen up, and socialize but don't be weird. have a good time, people are attracted to people that are having a good time and being themselves. learn some interesting tricks or trivia for conversation starters. if all else fails, get a job and find friendship there. you have to be open tho, don't be all quiet and keep to yourself. ask people for help, try to get someone to fill you in on everyone (who to steer clear of, who's cool, who's goes by the books, etc), find someone to show you the ropes. if this doesn't work, then i don't know what to say man|`|GrCj35muaa	You need more confidence, that is what people are naturally attracted to (not to be confused with *********) you will find your place in the world, i promise. do you have any cousins or family your own age? i met 90% of my friends through my cousin.|`|5abb6cf20f6d1b8b8ef23d153a85ab34aa	I'm nearly thirty and in a similar boat. The life of the average American is pretty isolated. You're not alone. I've heard it is one of the biggest culture shocks to people arriving in the US from other, more community-oriented cultures.<br>  <br>  We pride ourselves on being individuals so much that we lack community. What community we have is often plagued by cliques (partisans, religious fanatics, dogmatic people of every stripe and creed, the ditto-head clubs, etc). It is NOT uncommon to experience isolation through no fault of your own. For example, if you are unwilling to conform for the sake of joining a clique (particularly if you were female) finding a spot to hang your proverbial hat would be a pretty tall order.<br>  <br>  Since you are younger, I would suggest reading some books on anthropology, sociology, etc. There are also documentaries covering this subject:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.subdivided.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.subdivided.net/</a><br>  <br>  On the brighter side, because you are male, there is a good chance you will find this problem easing with time. Males tend to have broader friendships and don't have to fight cliques as much. That said, there have been plenty of guys who have had a hard time finding their niche in the type of society we are experiencing today.<br>  <br>  All I can suggest is that you volunteer, join discussion or other groups that interest you and see what you can find. For me, I've found it is difficult to get past the level of acquaintance with most people. STILL, a little human interaction every now and then is better than nothing--even if I don't feel 100% capable of being entirely authentic around the people I meet.<br>  <br>  All the same, enjoy people as much as you can, when you can, and try to be yourself to whatever extent you can. Even if you're alone, at least you'll be happy knowing you didn't try to force something which wasn't true.|`|zDPGjyRDaa	talk to some new. someone that dosen't have very many friends there self who knows you two could become best buddies!!|`|VC51Wnxwaa	Well, I know this guy who is in the same situation as you. He's called Tristan, and has a problem socializing because of his giant mole on his chin. Seriously, every time he tries to talk to me I end up staring and fantasizing about his mole. I once even got an erection from it!<br>  <br>  But seriously, I think you should learn how to spell first.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: sorry i think my friends were fooling around with my account after i used the computer at school, so could you stop hating on me? also, i'm a she, not a he. no erections happening here, especially not about moles...
1rmSuG2Haa	Aww.. I know how you feel.<br>  <br>  I've been in interracial relationships before and the men ALWAYS feel an affinity to their own race!<br>  <br>  It used to bother me too.. feeling like if he was so attracted to HIS RACE, why is he with me, when I look nothing like that.<br>  <br>  But I eventually set my concerns aside when I realized that we are all pre-programed (if you will) to be attracted to those who are most like us. Its simple genetics.. (its why some people can be attracted to their family and distant relatives without even knowing that they are related)<br>  <br>  Anyway, you have to simply accept it or get out of it. Of course he has to find you attractive, he's with you after all! But nature has it that he will always be attracted to those most similar to him too.<br>  <br>  Its nothing about you that causes it..  if he stopped, he respects you! And its a good sign.<br>  <br>  Good luck to both of you!|`|fCjrF1t8aa	What race are you, strangely enough depending on what race I have an answer.<br>  <br>  In that case, you are more than exotic enough.<br>  He is just using a lame excuse to insult you.  If can get you low enough, you're self esteem will be low enough for him to use you in way that he can. Don't fall for it.|`|xHzWG3t8aa	Anyone who makes you feel "Low" or who makes you so you don't shine as bright as you can, is not right for you. And why is he making fun of the way you look. You need to talk to him. Some relationship problems can't be solved by people you don't know!|`|kYH1OYB4aa	If youre a white girl...you dont have an exotic feel. Learn Arabic and get a tan.|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	He isn't doing anything. He is just commenting. My girlfriend always talks about how sexy puerto ricans are and how cool indians are and how bad *** asians can be. But in the end its me she is dateing. If she wanted someone else she would be with them<br>  <br>  The fact that he is dating you and not an arabian girl means he is interested in you and not an arabian girl.
DotZU7o3aa	i think it is best to be honest and say it. there is always a risk the feeling won't be reciprocated, but if you don't say, you will never know!!~!|`|AA11266289	fake drunk and call them or txt
qDXdCBgbaa	nope.  some friends may be a little weird about it, but physical contact is a natural human need. if your friends are ok with it, and so are you, dont worry about it.<br>  <br>  just make sure the other one knows you are just friends, or feelings can get hurt|`|SZZkfVzbaa	If you don't mean for it to mean anything sexual or whatever, I think it's fine.<br>  <br>  If it's with a guy, you may be giving him the wrong message which can cause issues in your Friendship.<br>  <br>  Also, I wouldn't do that with guys if you have a Boyfriend for obvious reasons.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|F3KkB4GWaa	No I do the same thing. Its not like you're getting off on it being close to people is just really comforting for some reason. People like that are way too stuffy.

ALvp7YRuaa	what do me.... like who do you want to leave...lol... ii think im confuse... but if your saying that why is your best friend close to yur man or you close to her man??huh?? ii dont understand...lol...but if you think that it is so hard then why do you think so.. is it maybe because you going to miss your bestfriend over a guy??? but you shouldnt make anything get in your way...|`|eKDYbe9Laa	share with bed one day|`|FSDwXVGvaa	why do u want to leave him
5VHWy0Ggaa	i don't know how they would ask it in a teasing way?<br>  <br>  but i am guess she likes you. she probably wants to know if you have one, because she wants to be yours! lol i'm not really sure... but it seems like she likes you... if you like her, and don't have a girlfriend, then go for it!|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	I would have thought the meaning is obvious. She fancies you, you wally!|`|1rmSuG2Haa	LOL.. guys..<br>  <br>  It means just that -- "Do you have a g/f? Oh, no?.. I'll be yours then!"<br>  <br>  Its pretty forward and simplistic.. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA10213887	ok it usually means she wants to date you or see if your seeing any one, or two she wants to date you while you are dating your gf, but ne ways, sounds like she likes you, but if she is bothering you touching and stuff tell her to stop, if your not dating any one and she isn't maybe get to know her more and ask her out.|`|fwnlY9viaa	She likes you, she's checking if you are avalible or not|`|79zndOApaa	It means she likes you|`|D0ShtJJJaa	She wants to know cause shes into you mann ;) REOW bahaha|`|oUhcnED7aa	Ick. It sounds like one of those really annoying clingy girls that you'd get stuck with in English class.... :S<br>  <br>  She probably likes you; and she's asking because she wants to know what boundaries she can and cannot cross with you.|`|YaJaoNDlaa	She so obviously fancies you.<br>  <br>  As a girl, I have never asked a guy that question unless I fancy him, at least a little.<br>  <br>  The touching should be so obvious! So hurry up and ask the girl out!<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Hope this goes well for you. :)|`|PbPiF2p3aa	She is interested. I think the only way she could get more bold about is this to threw a brick at you that says "I am interested". Man come on take the bate.|`|7oQ9eOCdaa	Its fairly obvious that she has a crush on you.|`|CuljUTxaaa	dunno. never got asked|`|xvxtQwV5aa	well doy! she wants to know if it's okay to be flirting with you like she does. still don't get it? SHE LIKES YOU|`|W0ZsuxRTaa	yeah. it's time to tap that.|`|fS5UkvkGaa	I would be careful if I were you. It might mean that she has a crush on you but then again it might mean that she is just joking with you. Almost every girl in my school does it to my friend Andy. I guess it depends how teasing she was and if you know her that well.|`|xHzWG3t8aa	Oh ya! She's interested! I had to constantly ask my husband this question before we even started dating, because his answer was always i don't know! But I was definitely looking to start a relationship with him.
fR2Geezcaa	How about ice skating or skiing. If you can find an outdoor rink or if you go skiing you could pack a picnic basket with something romantics like cocoa and chocolate's or if your old enough to drink you could pack wine and cheese.|`|JcOOvjIZaa	online adventure maybe?
2fW267GMaa	Not strange at all.  It's sort of a rule of attraction.  People that are off limits are that much more appealing.  I feel the exact same way about my buddies' girlfriends.  I too would never act on it, but they instantly are more attractive when they aren't single.  Attraction is cruel like that.|`|i88wWUdLaa	I'm like that, too... You could be a bit jealous... Or you could just see a side of the boy that you've never really known before, because you are getting to know them through your friend. Don't worry about it... As long as you are not acting on it, it's fine. Don't say anything to your friend, at alllll, unless you've been attracted to him for a very, very long time and it's not going away... Best of luck. :)|`|OgImx7G0aa	It happens to me all the time, i want wat other ppl have its bad to say but its true, in Jamaica we say " ur red eye" sometimes i will even put down a certain item and say i dont want it, but when someone takes it up and admires it i feel differently and want it. I like my friend's girlfriend right nw. lol|`|dLlI92OWaa	may be may be not. but seriously you should stay away. because making a move on the friends husband, won't be such a good decision. you might lose your friends and people who gets to know will not trust you and will think you are some kind of a *****|`|BbRewQjQaa	Some women just find taken men more appealing.|`|SCFD8AFJaa	i would say it is jealousy and the fact that you can not have them because they are taken.|`|qGGe855uaa	maybe because its something you cant have... like maybe if they broke up you wouldnt want them anymore...|`|WfxpiomNaa	your a skank!|`|QO6WwTPWaa	i am the same exact way. you think whats so specail about him thats worth keepin. and then you start looking at his charming assets and unlike when you check out men for your self you ignore his faults. onces you start thinking about the problems they have and start thinking about the things that dont atract you to him you will be so turned off focus on the negative about him. but tell your freid your attracted to her husand and that you would never do anything to hurt her and ask her what she thinks you should do then you wont have that monkey on your back getting hot for your freinds husband. also tell your freind how happy you are for her marriage and if she could help you find someone as great. it works for me.|`|QyZecktBaa	No its not strange. What you're doing is a game that has little risk involved. If you flirt with him or something and he reacts the same way, you win. but if he does not react like how you wanted, its ok cause you know he's taken already. It's just like playing the slots in the casino. You expect yourself to loose and you get thrilled when you win.<br>  Be attracted to a single guy next time HAHAHAHA <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|CuljUTxaaa	women are attracted to any guy in whom other girls are interested in<br>  <br>  Its called preselection. evolutionary its the sign that potential mate is desirable|`|e2NOLDGxaa	Maybe it's because you know the cute stuff he does and how he really is now that your friend is telling you all the details|`|2459c53a947c522e7c160ec150f8c8adaa	Jealousy and challenge.|`|YgVtCX3raa	U WHOR! HAHAHAHA I LIKE WHORS|`|rMq9D06Faa	Not strange actually!<br>  <br>  You suffer from a case of "I'll have what she's having.."<br>  <br>  Whether it be jealousy or "grass is greener" syndrome, you want what you can't have.  <br>  <br>  If/when she dumps them, you lose interest, right?|`|6iR7Mvc5aa	Yes It's very strange coz you can even grab him from her in future if you don't find the person you love.|`|jaP6STpLaa	No it's not strange at all- i'm sure it happens to many women, me included and that's because since that man is in  a relationship with your friend, you automatically feel more at ease with him- you don't feel the normal awkwardness and desire to impress as you would with an available man, so you like him|`|6xasBJcfaa	It's the fact of knowing you cannot have them. Knowing that you could never have them makes you want them that much more! It would also be so scandalous, which is sexy.|`|RMq1cKBNaa	I have had the same problem, I think it's jealousy.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	maybe thats the one thing you and ur friends have in common....boys! not good haha
AA11695632	All the love, romance and feeling good for her will go over a period of time and than there will be nothing to feel on marriage after that. The marriage will be just a informal relationship and husband will find his own way of living his own life over a period of time.. with it with other woman or other way of life.|`|rJxpXs35aa	easy going is good to a point as long as she dont let other guys do what ever they want,or it gets to the point other guys are hitting on you because thats the signals they are getting from you.the lethargic part would sound like she is lazy and dont care for herself or anyone else for that matter.could lead to big problems down the road.|`|zXvE5275aa	being lethargic and easy going are two different things. it depends on what she is. if she is easy going then its ok. and if she is lethargic then it could be a matter of some concern but its ok. nothing too bad for a relationship. just some work up will be required.|`|zdICmxizaa	I also knw a girl like this....whole day she sleeps. She don't like 2 do anything..she dnt like any visitors at home..dnt have any friends...her house is a big mess..I knw the guy..he feels really bad....|`|AA10494978	Depends on the husband.  If he is touchy feely and needs constant contact, he will feel rejected.|`|e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	I don't know.  Did you ask the husband?|`|4POGapREaa	That it's strange that you can be bothered to spell lethargic but not simple words like would & about.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Curse his luck|`|17fc2b122418131f22f55073029bb3b5aa	Nothing as such !<br>  <br>  He would be comfortable if thye wife is easy going but will be unhappy with her lathergic nature.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	it depends upon the personality.|`|AA11956029	he would think she is good for nothing n lacks back bone....|`|Rkik3eUuaa	he will be bored to death and starts cheating
07YBD5mJaa	Well, no one is ever prepared to catch their spouse or bf/gf cheating, although we all have a general idea of how we would like to react..it's very different once your in that situation. <br>  Crazy experiences, I think i a have the worst ever.<br>  So, I was about 18 and a senior in high school.<br>  I met this boy, who was four years older than me...and we started to date. It was nothing at first, my foster parent's didn't approve because he was older than me and because his family was very screwed up.<br>  Any how, I fell in love with him, head over heals!<br>  We dated all through my senior year, and at the end of the year, around prom, he proposed to me. I said yes, thinking he was the man for me.<br>  Well...hiding it from my family, I felt very confused about a lot of things.<br>  1. His family<br>  I knew his family, but never understood why my foster family hated them so much.<br>  2. His honesty<br>  He lied to me about a few things, but it was enough for me to doubt his integrity.<br>  3. Our future<br>  I didn't want to give up on my plans, college and work...although he said he didn't want me to work nor go to college.<br>  <br>  So.<br>  I opened up to some friends that knew him pretty well.<br>  You know what they told me, "don't marry him"<br>  I knew something was wrong, these were his friends!<br>  Well...it started to add up.<br>  His father was a middle school teacher that had been arrested for molesting his students, and had a very violent personality.<br>  Him not telling me this was enough to make me livid, after all I was going to marry into this family.<br>  <br>  One night he took me out, parked in the desert somewhere and told me that he had cancer and was dying.<br>  My heart dropped into my stomach.<br>  Then he tells me these exact words, " If you want to marry me you will have sex with me right now before I die"<br>  No joke.<br>  I said no...he kicked me out of his car...I walked two hours before I found my way home.<br>  <br>  So I decided to cal his mother and confront her about this...turns out she had no clue what he was talking about, that he did not have cancer.<br>  I called our engagement off.<br>  For weeks I didn't hear from him. Finally one day I get a call from one of his friends, who says he needs to talk to me. so I met up with him, and he informs me that My husband to be was moving into an apartment with another woman. He drove me to the apartment, and sure enough there was my boyfriend and another woman, in bed together.<br>  <br>  It has been four years, I have never talked to him since that moment.<br>  I am now married, to a man whom respects me and cherishes me!<br>  I look at it as a blessing, if I never learned the truth about him, I could be in a violent relationship with him cheating on me.|`|RMq1cKBNaa	idk.|`|lvxtggD7aa	well I'm in love with this guy and so far I've done fire twirling, parkour and lots of dangerous sports to impress him but nothing i do is ever good enough in his eyes so i gave up. as for the cheating once a cheater always a cheater no matter what he said or is going to say will change that. as for the emotions it's going to hurt for a long time but don't let that discourage you from other good people just let the emotions flow for a while and then move on.|`|NGyZCCo6aa	uhhh when we are in a relationship or like a guy we do crazy things. <br>  we become dependent on them for affection and happiness.<br>  a lot of times they are the only thing that makes us happy.<br>  they have this effect on us that makes us overlook anything they do, no matter how much it hurts.<br>  <br>  <br>  finding out your guy cheated on you hurts. you are confused/shocked/upset etc. you don't know what hit you.<br>  <br>  it hurts because you:<br>  -realize it's over<br>  -become sad, you can't imagine your life without him<br>  -are upset/mad/furious<br>  -can't believe it<br>  -think you're not good enough, and that other girl apparently it<br>  -become self concious|`|fC7IoWB0aa	1 time i thot this guy wuz cheetin on me bcuz evry1 sayed so n he wuz actin all wered n stuff like that n so me n my bff keyd his car n he had a rellllyy cute older brother n i started flirting wit him aaallll the time n i told evr1 at skool dat he had stds!!!!!!!! but den i found ot] he wasnt cheeting on me but id didnt feel bad neway|`|cIaqcI8Qaa	lol i give good advice but im not a girl  lol unfortunantly i cant anwser this becase i h8 cheaters...... and i read most people like a book.....

SCFD8AFJaa	My advice would be to just continue being yourself, and don't do anything to convince Stacy you were right. She will think you actually called Dezy a B****. It is better to tell her  " I am too old for this and when you realize i am not lying then you will stop ignoring me"... because apparently Dezy can convince people better than you. Also since she is younger they automatically believe her. So a friendship is always worth trying to save but at this situation you can't really do much. It has to work out by itself if it is meant to be.
7f906763f9888e887863fdd7765b508daa	Easiest way is to be straight forward and just ask him, if he doesn't then go for it, if he does then that just means he know a girl other than his own thinks he's attractive.

Just use common sense for the conversation.  while talking to her, talk to her like you've known her for years.

wdUhwD61aa	Oooh, I know how you feel. I have a Bailey character in my life. Except, she seems to fight differently then your Bailey. My Bailey doesn't like confrontation at all and will only do it if she's surrounded by people, if at all.<br>  <br>  Anyway, manipulative people (by personality) do not hit first. They usually take it out later. So, she probably won't hit you if you just yell that she's "fat" or something. You just have to say something really mean and that really gets to her.<br>  <br>  But please remember, what you say, you can't un-say. If you say something bad enough to make a girl hit you, your friends will hear it and it's possible you will lose them all. Also, if the principal catches you hitting anyone (no matter if they hit first) you will be kicked out, just warning you. So you HAVE to decide if it's worth it or not. Most times, it's not. Take it from someone who has been in your situation, you don't want her knowing she got to you.|`|p59ib3FIaa	just say her mama is a fat ***** and other she'll want to hit you and ancd throw the b word around alot but make sure you can  fight first|`|GHH1i6d3aa	People only hurt others because they are suffering themselves.

HnEcgVGiaa	Hi Cher,<br>  <br>  Generally, a strong relationship starts off with the forging of trust and building of a good connection. However, it's different for everyone because they each seek different things in their special someone.<br>  <br>  Some people can be shallow and can easily be seduced simply through physical attractions. Of course, how people look may influence your opinion on someone, but these people are guided only by this single attribute and look for the other characteristics later on.<br>  <br>  Others seek to see who the other person really is. They seek people who are sensitive, caring, supportive, understanding, and patient. As long as you display these characteristics, as well as compassion, warm smiles, and a welcoming heart, people will see you positively.<br>  <br>  Learn to respect and love yourself. Be confident, and yet humble. Again, people look for various things, but these are the general basics.<br>  <br>  Now, if you want to literally have someone fall head over heels for you, well.. you just gotta hold 'em and flip them over! >.> Lame.. I know..<br>  <br>  Anywho, hope that helps a bit.<br>  <br>  Best of luck on finding your special someone.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Be yourself and be nice.

Ask yourself, is it ok that you don't like him?  If you say yes, why is it?  Why is it ok for you not to want to date him?  Does he seem dangerous to you?  If so, then you might want to reconsider on what exactly to do.  If no, if he doesn't seem like he's going to rape you, or stalk you, etc., then what is the worst thing that could happen if he does ask you out?  He might want to, but is probably very afraid to, and might sense your wibe of refusal towards him.  Being friendly, and simply saying that you're not interested, is ok.  There's no reason to be mean to him, or to anyone.  You can try to avoid him, but it might be best not to go out of your way in doing so and simply live your life.  Just a song ringing in my head right now "He's was a boy, and she was a girl, can I make it anymore obvious?" Sorry.|`|a6Us8qF1aa	I think you are stereo-typing a bit.  This boy may be very shy.  If he does talk to you, listen and talk back to him and not at him.  Every person is different and each should be considered by their own actions and words.  Talking to him and being friendly is not dating.<br>  <br>  And since you are aware, in school some day, just say "Hi" in a friendly way and see what happens.  And if you can talk to him, politely let him know that oggling make you feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Abraham Lincoln said "If you look for the worst in people; you will find it."  Well if he had a relationship with Jesus, he would have said "Look for the good in people; when you find it, encourage it, nuture it, and care for it."  I think the later would make for a much more beautiful and peaceful world.  What do think?|`|AA10955690	Hi Daisy,my moto is honesty is the best policy.

F3KkB4GWaa	No nothing wrong with that. Most people dont meet the person they're destined to be with when they're 18. If they have then they're lucky bastards.

Things didnt work out.<br>  <br>  After that i built a new list on how i wanted my guy to look and act.<br>  <br>  A year and a bit later... I found a guy who EXACTLY matched the criteria that i had made up in my head.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with waiting to have a boyfriend. I also highly doubt it has anything to do with your appearance. My own experience found that many boys in high school couldn't handle the type of woman I was-- always independent, very smart, and extremely mature. My educated guess is that it may be somewhat the same for you. Do not lose hope at all. Be exactly who you always have been and you will find very soon that true men are attracted to you for the mere reason of the great person you are. Just don't settle for less than you deserve or think you deserve less because you are unsure of your appearance. There are many opportunistic men out there that will try to take advantage of that, making you have a lower self worth than what is reality.|`|I68m0kCraa	I think it's bad that you use the word bad.  Oy....<br>  <br>  I was 25 before I had my first boyfriend.  And we ended up being together for 2 years.  Now I'm 29 and single again... And it doesn't bother me a bit.<br>  <br>  My advice is:<br>  don't think about it<br>  it will happen when it happens<br>  love yourself before you love someone else<br>  <br>  If you are truly confident in who you are as a person, you shouldn't need to worry about a boyfriend.  Remember, people are attracted to confident people - that's what makes them attractive.  If you're confident in yourself, you'll be attractive, and if you're attractive, you'll get the guy. ;)|`|a6Us8qF1aa	No, it is not bad.  You may simple be a late bloomer or a plain Jane.  Remember true beauty is not on the surface of your body.  True beauty is inside of you -- Kindness, concern, helpfulness, caring, loving, sharing joy, and more.  These things you take to heaven with you.  The body fades at 30, it chalks at 40, first wrinkles at 50, miore wrinkles in the 60s and 70s, pruning in the 80s, and finally elephant hide.  But true beauty from within is vibrant always and brings warmth and smiles to those who know your ways.  Do not worry, the right man with come along for you.  Be good and be patience.|`|AKqmF6mfaa	Me too at the age of 25 have no girl friend, but do'n demoralised it is life.

Couldn't date until they were 16 anyway.  Too many kids rush into dating and sex and have major problems so  you have avoided a lot of problems.<br>  <br>  Now - what can you do.  Examine yourself realistically and decide what you can do to make yourself more attracive.  I think women are more practical and go for nice guys and guys who are good to them or who are funny and they don't have to be as attractive.  men are more visual creatures and have to get ot know you first so you need to get past what they see inf ront of their faces.  Could your hair be styled differently?  Could you go down to a nice store and get a free make up job?  Or have Mary Kay person make you over?  Do you need to lose weight?  Then begin an exercise and diet program to take off some pounds.  You have an opportunity now so make the best of it.<br>  <br>  I sure hope  you don't settle for anyone that would not be good for you.  Sure you should have hope. But you also need to be in places to meet people.  Be active in a club or in doing something.  Find girlfriends and go places together.  Smile and talk to guys.  Don't have to do much flirting, but need to be fun to be with.  <br>  <br>  Today is the first day of the rest of your life so make the best of it.  What do you want to accomplish?  Go to college if  you can.  Find yourself a career.  Be where you will meet people.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.

Because you have no girlfriend? That's nothing to feel inferior about. I am 25 and I don't have a girlfriend. It's not because I can't get one it is because at this time in my life I don't want one. Things will happen for you in time my friend, this you can be sure of.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	You'll find a girlfriend when the timing is right!|`|opiCNFPAaa	i thnk thas kinda cute aww lol|`|hZWZnoDMaa	It's nothing to feel inferior about , you should only have a girlfriend when you're ready and even if you can't find the right one now just know that there is somebody for everyone. What you can do is to socialize more with females, go to bars, restaurants, clubs, churches, join a social clubs, or you can try online dating since it's more convenient. Don't be afraid of rejection and absolutely do not lose hope, I promise she'll come along soon.
e44113cd9f21585ce32b6f910959288daa	You can like him all you want, but if you act on it you  could cause him to get into legal trouble.  That is how many men get on the Sex Offenders List because they have had sex with and underage person.  It can cause him not to be able to get a job or get into a good college if he is going.  There is a lot of things at risk.|`|Q06InngZaa	forget about it......for more reasons than we have time to talk about here.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	for get him.. he is trying to have a future and he can't if he winds up on the pedophile list or in prison for messing with a child like you. Stick to guys your own age if at all. Most likely if you start  getting serious with guys at your age. You will wind up pregnant. Then raising a child as a single parent  . That will all but kill any chance to have  a eduction with a career that pays well. You will be stuck in the welfare line or working for $7.25 a hour at wal-mart or McDonalds. Forget guys .. there nothing but trouble at your age..|`|442e5f4a3db253f9ae4c7782d74143a1aa	It's normal. But since the age gap is a precarious one (big difference between 80-86 and 14-20), I would suggest you keep it platonic. Your interests are not the same, he might be interested in things that are even illegal at your age. Sex, partying, drinking, or just things as him getting a job versus you wanting to go to a pijama party, etc.|`|xdOgQPEkaa	i dont think ts bad for  14 yr old to have a crush on a 20 yr old<br>  <br>  i thik its bad if the 20 yr old even THINKS of having any kind of relationship (sexual, emotional, even friendship) with a 14 yr old girl<br>  <br>  that would make him a pedophile. dont go trying to put yourself in situations like that|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	As long as he doesn't like you back, it's fine.<br>  <br>  But honestly, if you REALLY DO like this guy, stay away from him.<br>  <br>  There is so much crap going around about statutory rape and child molestation, all it would take is a neighbor to see the two of you talking, or kissing... and BOOM!  The guy's in jail.<br>  <br>  I'm not joking.  It happened to my close friend.  The girl's mom pressed charges because she found out that the girl had gone to my friend's house with some of her (older) friends.  He was in jail for months, and the trail dragged out for years.<br>  <br>  Seriously, don't mess around with statutory rape.  Find a guy your own age, and keep yourself - and other people - SAFE!|`|YbSsCVRRaa	you are in your teen and act according to your age. it is good for your welfare and safety of your life. do what your mother advises.|`|Vxk3oifMaa	Well if it's a crush then its okay you'll eventually get over him but do not act on it. It is wrong. That is against the law for you to be involved with someone so much older then you and the guy could go to jail and lose everything like his job, place at college and many people won't accept him because of his time in jail.|`|aaCMNSB2aa	When i was 14 i dated a man that was 32.... yes, yes, I know, go ahead; I know you want to say it- Ewwwww.... Good, so now that's out of your system- I dated this guy more then half my age at a very young age. We had a lot in common: music, motorcycles, movies, cars, art, the peace corps, so on and so on. He was cool for a while but he wanted to do... things (understand). I thought about it but wanted to wait till I was 18 so he wouldn't get in trouble. He wouldn't let the subject drop and it only got more and more worse the longer I said no. It made me realize what kind of prick dates someone so young. I broke up with him quickly; I don't want to even think about what would have happened if I stayed. <br>  <br>  Just wait till you're 18, It would be better for everyone (you and him because he'll be punished for it). And no, it's not wrong; you can't decide to like someone. Just don't react to your feelings for him. It may be great right now but won't end pretty.<br>  <br>  --XOXOX, CutieNiki|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I wouldn't bother personally.  At 20, all guys want sex.  Not only do they want sex, but it's illegal to have it with you, so you'd have to keep your relationship a big annoying secret, putting him at risk of going to jail if he ever did get into your pants, which he surely would try to do.  Make your life easier and stick with guys closer to your own age.|`|aAUeWJ5laa	It's not bad. You can't help who you like. I would suggest that you don't take any action on it yet though. You're at different stages of life and probably don't want the same things. Wait until you're older and see if you still like him! Good luck. :)|`|BSg9J96Oaa	It's alright to like him, or anyone at any age.  It's not alright to date him or get involved in any other way.  Guys that are in college age tend to take advantage of girls of your age.|`|CaWf475jaa	It is ok to like someone older than you.  But remember you are still young no need to rush into things.  There are plenty of fish out there as they say.  Enjoy your life with family and friends.

Why couldn't you erase him from your buddy list or contact?<br>  <br>  Sound like you hate him because he doesn't ACKNOWLEDGE you when you're ONLINE, but then again, what is holding you back to just say HI to him.<br>  <br>  Go ahead and say HI to HIM.  BUT if you REALLY want his ATTENTION, CURSE him OUT FIRST then say HI to HIM.|`|Jqmyxmboaa	he's probably waiting for you to talk to him too. <br>  he's being stubborn. just go ahead, it won't hurt to try.<br>  <br>  but this dude above me does have a point...|`|441002ba222c31246fd283fc8f2694bfaa	Why the **** do you care if your ex is always on MSN? so he has an onlife life.

Does it necessarily mean he wants to talk to you? there are other people on the internet.<br>  <br>  But form how you sound it seems like you definitely want to talk to him. Well go for it. Then again, there is a REASON he is your EX.|`|AA10010935	Is there a particular reason why you need to be talking to your ex on msn?|`|a7a3379686a9b62bae0a4c14b66f9b47aa	he obviously dont like yu no more.<br>  yu deserve better so cheer up [=|`|L3sHlB6zaa	sure talk. same thing happened with me and my ex bf. nothing wrong with saying hi or asking how he is doing. :)
ahujYDBdaa	You tell your best friend.|`|AA11043457	It is hard.  When you really care for someone and then he hurts you or betrays you, it hurts for a long time.  It is worse when it is with your best friend.  But what you need to do is to do other things.  Find some new friends and not just the one you have where you are going to see him all the time.  See other friends.  Smile at a guy you think  you'd like to get to know.  Say hello.  Get in some activities and see about dating again.  You do eventually get over them.  <br>  <br>  I was married 25 years and had 2 kids and he left. I didn't want a divorce but really had no choice.  I hurt dreadfully. I was betrayed.  He cheated me in other ways as well.  <br>  <br>  but I got involved in some things with other women and went to singles groups at church and met people. I eventually met someone and married.  We have been married 17 years now.  It is harder when you are older to start dating again.  Not as many choices either.<br>  <br>  So you are young and your whole life is ahead of you.  You can go to college and meet friends there.  In fact that is probably a bitter place to date even.  So you will get over it and you will eventually find someone.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|l0xnIquFaa	i wish i could tell you. im going through the same thing right now|`|obTSP9gFaa	focus your energy on another cute guy, its the only way.|`|AKqmF6mfaa	Please clear his/her doubt and clear your fanda, tell truthly|`|YGDsepzuaa	a complete cut off from any contact. find a new boyfriend. if you look good it shouldnt be hard at all.|`|AA10317249	stop being friends, if you really want to get over him get him out of your life.

FSJFBt6haa	you cant go wrong with jewelry... depending on how far into the relationship you are, you can get her a ring or if you haven't been dating long just some ear rings or necklace, find out first what she wears mostly gold or silver... but if this is to much commitment send her some flowers at work (decent ones) or a nice dinner... you cant go wrong with any of this... don't get her nothing tho!! you will never hear the end of it|`|syLCg7f3aa	You didn't give enough info.

Respect yourself more than that. I know it's what you want, but do you really want it if he's just using you? When things like that happen be straight up with him. Tell him you can't do these things unless you know what they mean... he's getting his cake and eating it too. Meaning, he does't have to commit to you but he's still getting the benefits of massages and who knows what else eventually ... don't let yourself get hurt.|`|A7SCkuvEaa	most guys are stupid, some don't catch on to things as quickly as you would think. perhaps he liked you,maybe he thought you were just friends and didn't make a move. now that he knows you like him, he wants something more. i know this because this exact thing happened to me. i thought this girl and i were friends, i was so stupid she was giving me signs, i didn't notice these signs so i started flirting with other girls. thats when i caught on that she liked me because she was mad and thought i was an assh@le|`|F8t4fAm1aa	maybe he's afraid of you rejecting him,from my point of view he likes you too,so all you goptta do is seduce him,try to kiss him without any warning and thats it baby he's urs|`|1psFgpmyaa	ASK HIM<br>  you have a right to know where you stand with him<br>  if you two are best friends it'll be ok...it might be awkward for a little bit but you'll bounce back<br>  <br>  good luck|`|ZA11WBR2aa	He's just playing so better get away from him.|`|UsJDUm1Haa	now that he knows you like him he might just be using you. but find out|`|kbkbDhwLaa	If he's that flakey, why pursue him anymore? Force him to give you space by separating yourself from him. Any sexual interactions with him would be a big mistake. He knows that you are interested in him and when around him you are vulnerable. It sounds to me as though he's taking advantage of you, rather than attempting to pursue a relationship. My suggestion would be: distance. Steer clear of him and find someone else.|`|GrCj35muaa	Be straight forward with him.

There may be more game playing and pursuit from your side though as some married men may be reluctant to commit to adultery.  So ...Heavy flirting .... sweet nothings ..... texting/emails ...... "casual" hangouts at the pub or the movies can all be used to "seduce" the man.  And you will know if he is interested in you.<br>  <br>  I have known many people who have engaged in this kind of situation and 90% have ended badly because the "mistress" has then wanted more from the man (eg him leaving his wife for her) and the man hasn't been able to comply.<br>  The other 8% have been just in a casual fling or "benefit" situation, so once they had what they wanted they were able to leave the situation as they didn't get emotionally involved, and the other 2% has been when the guy has left the wife for the mistress.|`|7oQ9eOCdaa	Sorry, but I'm judging. People don't ask these questions because they're "just wondering", its more like you're actually CONSIDERING doing it.

I would encourage you to read the book love languages, by Gary Chapman, and find out what says I love you to him.

Then got her cake and a birthday present from the trunk of the car. Put a candle in the slice of cake and told her to make a wish. (That was the only cake she had that day so it was special because it was the only birthday wish she made). Then we went to 7-11 and got slurpees.<br>  <br>  Now slurpees and 7-11 and even the time 7:11 is like our own thing lol.<br>  <br>  I asked her out 2 days later and she said ya. <br>  <br>  So... what your doing is more romantic but kinda along the same lines and I think it would be perfect. good luck.|`|denyKCABaa	The game and lingerie + dinner is great, good for you!

Do not get discouraged, just keep trying.  Tell me how you would feel if you were 80 years old and felt alone because everyone you know has already taken their final trip.  I am 80 years old and I still have something to live for.  It is worth it to look at life in a positive manner.  Good luck - and have a great life.|`|BSg9J96Oaa	It's depression.  There are a few ways to cope, therepy, medications, or by yourself.  It's alright to sulk, only for a little while.  Try going for walks, or baking a cake, whatever floats your boat.  That way you have something to look back on and say, 'I did that. I'm the coolest person ever.'  You can't move forward when all you see is a freeze frame.

And thats true. Love your brother, no matter what he has done.<br>  My brother was in a gang, and when I was 5, a rival gang poured gasoline all over our house, and lit a match. My little sister died in the fire. It was horribly tragic, and I still havent gotten over it. But I love my brother, and I dont blame him for it. He has been in jale, on and off. Now he is 27. He recently got his GED, and his license was revoked, but he just got it back. he is now married with a decent job, and he has 3 children, and 2 step children. He has a good life now, and I have never stopped loving him. We love each other through thick and thin. Please, love your brother. Dont ever forget him.

Before doing this though, he'd have to break up with his current girlfriend. I just hope he's not playing mind games with you and keeping you on a string just in case this new relationship doesn't work out. I suggest you try to move on and keep busy as much as possible. If you're meant to be together in the future, things will work out. I'm kind of in the same situation as you; my ex-boyfriend is playing games with me just to see if I'm interested but I have the feeling he's moved on. Relationships can be so complicated.

Obviously there will always be a special bond between you two, because you were married, however you will need to see that he's moved on to another woman, and you can't let that upset you, the best thing you could do for yourself is find happiness with another man who would not ignore you or your phone calls, tell you that there is another woman in his life, and send you all kinds of different signals about him thinking about you, bbecause OBVIOUSLY he isn't, otherwise he would have dumped the other woman, and gave you both another try. I hope you find true happiness, and I hope this helps somehow..|`|W3Dc26QKaa	He is playing games if he truly loved you he would marry you. Let the gf know, you will see then that things will change.

c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	I've seen situations like this before, you could do either of the two:<br>  <br>  1. Keep it a secret until the perfect time comes around.. <br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  2. Tell him while he has a gf and risk losing him as a friend if he doesn't return the feelings in return, <br>  <br>  of course all this clearly depends on how serious he is with his gf, if they have been together for over a year, then I would not bother, if anything wait it out and if there happens to come a time that you two are single and ready to commit to each other, then it will happen.<br>  <br>  but if hes got a gf and doesn't show any signs of letting her go over you, then just leave it and try to move on to someone who doesn't consider you a best friend.

GrCj35muaa	I would start with trying to have a secret sharing convo, tell her you haven't shared this with many people if any and you trust her to not judge you with this secret of your and let her know you are bisexual. don't let her know you have feelings for her until you see how she reacts, if she is curios about girls, this would be a good time to share that with you and you are giving her the opportunity. By telling her you trust her not to tell anyone and not to judge you, you are planting a bug in her ear that she can trust you as well.|`|FzFSzilmaa	are you sure it is a good idea to hit on your new friend quite so quickly???<br>  <br>  perhaps you should ask her out... or maybe to your place... and get drinking... then tell her you are bisexual and are very sexually attracted to her...see what happens... and if she gets upset, blame it on the drink... :)|`|U7SnmcxYaa	what i do is i ask someone to ask them what theyre sexuality is and then if its bisexual or lesbian i ask them out.

And ask HER, how do she feel about "this girl" and would she hit on "this girl".  Once you find out that she is into GIRLS or maybe NOT.  Next you got to make her ACCEPT your BI-sexuality by giving HER some stories of your "FEMALE ENCOUNTER" so she know that you're in to GIRLS.<br>  <br>  If she heard you "female encounter stories" and DOESN'T APPROVE of it by her body languages or comments THEN you most LIKELY know she is STRAIGHT.<br>  <br>  But on the other hands, if she shows sign of APPROVAL from your stories, then it is LIKELY she might be BI.

So I guess just one day at a time.|`|nmiIHzczaa	I have been asking this same question since the night before Valentines Day. I have found that it makes things easier by expressing your feelings to someone who cares about you. I have vented for hours every single day, asking so many questions and wanting only to get the answers from my ex and not the person I was talking to. So besides someones shoulder to cry on, the only thing that makes it better is time. The physical pain in my body every time I think about her has slowly gotten easier to take as the days go by. It feels like an amazingly intense anxiety attack with just the thought of her not being in my life anymore. I know its not an easy thing to deal with, but time and expressing yourself are the only thing that even helps. And just come to the realization that your life is now the exact opposite of what you thought it would be. Everything has changed and it will hurt for a very very long time. I still cant stop thinking about her or her daughter that I may never even see again.|`|LljonTkJaa	Honestly, you don't. If the person truly is the love of your life, you'll never get fully over it. However, you learn to live with it. You'll learn that the person will always be a part of you regardless of whether or not you're together in the physical sense. You'll spend time going over every memory that you can think of that involved that person, some will make you cry, some will make you laugh, but you'll be thankful you have them. There will be days when it hurts so much you won't know what to do and there will be days where you'll feel like you've finally come to terms with it and gotten over it. Time does ease the pain overall, but it can also worsen it in some aspects because it gets further away from when you were with that person last. You won't want to be with anyone else, or at least you know in your heart that any other person is never going to compare to that person. It's tough but it's manageable. Good luck...|`|HPO87jGiaa	Well there really is no one good answer for this.  Love is different for everyone.  If you've divorced over adultery, then you may need to just move on and find better(unless you are the person who committed it, then bad you!).  If for any other domestic reason such as money problems, physical abuse, then you deserve so much better.  But if it was just because you fell out of love, then the only thing to heal you would be time.

This is a very normal and regular behaviour of boys who are in college and schools but if he is above 20 then it can be a problem soon for both of you.I think above 20 boys have maturity to behave and control their feelings but this should not be the case so you should move on.If you talk about love and friendship it happens automatically.<br>  About your learning for sexual activites then forget it. You dont need to learn it and if you really wann learn then watch any porn movie and if your boy is smart then he will teach you all this but trust me there must be an alternative when he starts repecting your feelings. you can always try leaving him alone for somedays then he will start respecting you.

You can check into to see if it would work for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://marriage.about.com/cs/legalities/a/proxymarriage.htm" rel="nofollow">http://marriage.about.com/cs/legalities/...</a>|`|3Ry2iuGBaa	Are you ready for a threesome???<br>  got your attention ?  Well, being in the military is like being married. And you would be the 3rd party if you get married to him, r u ready for that?<br>     This is not like a job you go to then go home and leave the work behind. You cant just quit or walk away like you would do anyjob. Everything you do has to do with the military, and if you marry him, you are marrying into that contract that he cant break. <br>  Next - the best thing you can do if you do want to get married ( Which marrage is a legal contract) is to talk to a lawyer cause the laws are different in each state and a lawyer who knows both states would be able to give you the best advice.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	it is the love and faith towards each other that unites.
55Xq3a5Laa	I can't stand liars. I wouldn't stay with him. Lying is never good even if he claims he was just trying not to upset you. It seems like he can't be trusted, if he can't tell you the truth about spending time with his ex wife, then theres no possible way you can take his word when he says "we just had dinner" or "we just had lunch" or "we didn't sleep in the same bed" I know thats not what you want to hear but I hate dumb *** guys that can't be honest and faithful to ONE woman.|`|U2YK6lcJaa	he is using you and  having sex with her i would leave asap|`|W3Dc26QKaa	Watch your back, maybe even hire a private detective. I'd confront your husband and his ex. I go through baby mama drama. She is also friends with my husbands family. What your husband did was wrong, either you are going to forgive and go on, deal with it, or let it eat you up. I am planning on leaving my husband because of his issues. I can't tell you what to do, but I will keep you in my prayers.|`|YNkdm9q4aa	wow, sounds very simular with my boyfriend, he pays her cell phone bill, talks to her everyday, and i find it kind f`d up in a way, me and him dnt get along at all, im not too sure with ur situation, i wish i could help but i deff know what ur going through|`|4POGapREaa	It's impossible to tell from this one question whether he's just an insensitive @sshole or you're so insecure that he feels like he has to hide things from you to avoid drama.|`|eeaXYyCNaa	He slept in the same room as some one he had a history with and he expects you to be ok with it.

My husband would not under any circumstances stay in a hotel with his ex and they do get along okay for the sons sake but I'm usually the one that deals with her. I'm lucky I guess cause my hubby always talks to me about everything and usually wants me to handle it. He has never lied about anything to do with the ex. The best thing for you to do is talk to your man and find out exactly what he thinks about you and ask him how he would feel if things were reversed. But I believe you already know the answer.....are you okay with living like this forever?|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	Are you guys married? or are you just a girlfriend? If you are a gf, then don't get into this relationship thinking that just because you are uncomfortable with the way he spends his money, spends his time, etc. etc, that he he is going to change once you both are married, it wont, all you will get are lies, if you are already married then I honestly don't see a happy ending for you, as they both have children, and thus it will always bring them together.Hope this helps somehow, good luck!|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	He has been lying to you (the "reasons" why don't matter; a lie is exactly that -- a LIE).<br>  When you tell him how you feel about his behavior, he gets angry.<br>  There are just too many "bells and whistles" going off here!<br>  If he really, truly loved you, he would be honest. Honesty and openness are essential especially for your most intimate of relationships. <br>  I would get out before it got any deeper. <br>  For your sake, don't let him "sweet talk" you into staying.<br>  Good luck!|`|w6v8JnBAaa	I can understand how confusing & hurtful this situation is. I would be a mess! I'm wondering though, since you said you were younger & you didn't say that you were married, are you the reason they are divorced?<br>  Anyway,  I think you can safely say that he is NOT being upfront with you. He is NOT respecting you as his partner/equal & he DID sleep with his ex whilst sharing the same room so to save enough money to be able to stay another night.<br>  You would wise to make plans to move on & just in case I'm right about the reason for the divorce...stay AWAY from married men. You'll have much better luck in your future.
kA1mYSOtaa	Well, James, you are right not to believe her excuse that she is too busy. I am glad to see that your ego was not too strong for you to see right through it.<br>  <br>  The truth is that if she were truly interested in you and your relationship, her being busy would be a burden, but it would not be enough for her to break up with you.<br>  <br>  So she initially turned you down because she was being asked out by someone else? Jimmy, you should have forgotten about her at that very moment. But like most guys, you pushed forward, determined to break through that barrier of non-interest.<br>  <br>  When she told you that she was just too busy, what she really meant was that she was too busy with Mr. Someone Else to be with you. At this point, you should have said, "Well, babe, I'm sorry that this has bogged you down. But call me when you have time." Then, you throw away her number, burn all memorabilia reminding you of her, and disappear from the face of the earth. This whole "I still wanna be friends" thing is just a way for her to hold onto you in case she gets bored. <br>  <br>  So what should you do now? Break off all contact with this dame. Find a new woman who respects you, and do some dating. This one is clearly not worth your time or effort. I wish you luck, my friend.|`|HKtxjWV1aa	Goodness kids these days...she broke up with you by IM'ing you? I know tech is convenient, but at least she could have the respect you tell it face to face. Sounds like she ain't taking it too seriously, buddy...maybe it's not worth it?|`|A7SCkuvEaa	yeah man im doin her right now, i just jizzed on her face. get a life man, go stick it in someone else and stop being such a pansy|`|AXOOuK5yaa	Too long to read make it shorter. But if she breaks up with you it's her loss go find another. There are plenty of girls out there...|`|VZC13ltuaa	i believe her feelings for you left and she had no other way to break up with you except for that excuse.|`|11eff3f79a9e15abe0c3be3ee9640961aa	Maybe she could tell that you were a lot more serious about her then she was you.  She could be the type that does not want to get serious about anyone but just date and have fun.  I am sure she likes you but like I said maybe she just does not want to get serious with anyone right now even though you do.<br>  She probably just wants you for a friend and not a lover.  Some gals just want to be free for a while and have certain goals in their life and do not want to have a serious relationship while trying to get them.|`|VxDITnZYaa	I agree that it wasn't because of being busy but it could have been in a way... if you are really unsure about it, i can give you some reasons as to why she may have broken up with you... her grades may be dropping from spending too much time with you, her parents may not like her dating, or she decided to go with the guy who asked her first. i really am unsure but it may be from one of those 3. Hope i helped!|`|xOQwPGokaa	When people get together at first the feelings and attractions are strong but something aould have happened that turned her off to you don't waste your time on people that don't think that you are worth theirs. Getting back together at a later date will more than likely have the same result as the last go round.|`|OLJAj0gpaa	Love sucks sometimes, she probably liked you, but maybe she was too busy, I honestly did break up with a guy because I was too busy, theres was just too much stuff going on in my family to have to worry about not spending enough time with a bf at the time. However if she was lying to you, then you really are lucky to not have got dragged further into a "meaningless" relationship, and be glad she was considerate enough to let you know she wasn't ready to be in one, because some girls just leave the guy to find out they arent together by letting him see her with another guy. Either way you should move onto a girl who would more than gladly make the time to be with you, I hope you find her soon! good luck!|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	Love sucks sometimes, she probably liked you, but maybe she was too busy, I honestly did break up with a guy because I was too busy, theres was just too much stuff going on in my family to have to worry about not spending enough time with a bf at the time.

But might that not prejudice your case against your husband?
fR2Geezcaa	He would not be changing his status to single if he did not want someone to think he was. It sounds like he is in the mist of trying to hook up with someone else.

Belive me I know.|`|VZC13ltuaa	Wow. He probably hooked up with another girl and maybe she/he added each other online to talk. He changed has status to single to make himself available for the girl, and deleted your comments so that maybe the girl wont read the comments you sent to him. He didn't pick up because he was too busy doing something with the girl and told you not to call because he did not want you to interrupt him when he is with that girl or he is on the phone with her. BUT I COULD BE WRONG!|`|oVw5BNaKaa	Sad  to say but here it goes. You haven't been together that long. If you live less than 25 miles from him and haven't seen him for 3 weeks, hes just not that into you. Unless he is in the military, his absence is a big issue. When you first start to like someone you want to spend as much time with them as possible. That's if you truly like that person a lot. But if that person means nothing to you, you wont. Ask him to change his status on myspace. Also ask him not to delete you comments. If he refuses either, let him go. He is not worth the heartache. He will hurt you in the end.

Talk it out with your husband, suggest that you start living separately away from Inlaws.  If this is not acceptable, in your Inlaws house, you can live separately.  Warn your Inlaws not to cause any trouble lest you will report to Authorities.   Contact social organizations in your area to intervene and help.  <br>  <br>  When your Inlaws see you fight back, they will become careful and keep away from you.  Tell your inlaws that you have given a written complaint against your Inlaws to Police and if anything happens to you or your child, Police will arrest your Inlaws.  This way, you will put fear in them.  <br>  <br>  Believe in yourselves, believe in God and goodness and things must improve.

Learn to live the life rather than die in life.All the best|`|sXWxvo7Xaa	first thing you should do is to figure out the cause/ causes or the expectations of ur inlaws and where u r not fitting into it,than see whether u can possibly make changes in urself as per what they want, for example they want u to get up early n serve breakfast early due to medical reasons,than next thing u do is bear them with patience as if they r ur parents n due to ur continued goodness they may become ur best friends/well wishers sooner, than put across ur husband about the continous bad behaviour inspite of ur best efforts n its possible ur husband shift u in another house,next thing u do is involve ur elders , thus u first explore all peace options, if not resolve than declare war by filing 498 case against them make their journey thru jail, police,courts,than leave no stone unturned in making them suffer,regarding ur child anytime u can file for his custody,further if u find another husband than sooner u will have other kids,so dont worry about kids,u can have as many u want ,thus this is real solution.|`|U8rjbwUBaa	tell them to get f...;; as you were there before the kids but you and the kids donot have to stay.donot leave your kids-even for a un supervised vist.if your guy willnot go with yous just godonot trun back they are the ones with the problems,and will always make you feel little.|`|IXskJPlVaa	It is not the in-laws but you husband who is important - if he is with you - you can handle the situation.

PHYj1UPwaa	Lust..Men are selfish beasts..You'll hopefully learn as you get older and wiser..Move on with your life...|`|sw6FLjlPaa	Some men (told me before) that they prefer to have several partners. They love to have the feeling of being 'loved' by several women. These made them feel 'strong'. <br>  Just one of the animals behavior. So, with humans common sense should able to know the answer.|`|1HTRWrawaa	Lust! Don't give the pig a second thought. When a man jokes about wanting to use you for sex, he's not joking. Just walk away, you are too good to let a guy disrespect you that way.|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	who cares whether its arranged or not, hes married, stop thinking about him, married men are nothing but hassle and trouble, just ask their wives lol|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	It takes a lot more then talking to fall in love talking about sex is just lust.|`|OJID5JLBaa	sounds to me like lust along with alot of BS He's saying to the person just to fill her head full of crap.  Those kinds of guys you need to stay away from they like to tell you what you want to hear by filling your head full of lies and most of them don't mention their girlfriend at all or if they do they say well we are in the process of breaking up so it makes you feel like he loves you then you find out he lied again and is staying with that girl.|`|GQJbOblQaa	There is no harm in joking.  The guy is a wise person.  After marriage, he had cut off the relationship or intentions about another girl.  So, it is wise for you to also cut off and keep away.  There is no need for any forum posting.  <br>  <br>  The fact that he married someone else shows he has no love for you.  <br>  <br>  So, keep away and enjoy life.|`|PbPiF2p3aa	Does it matter now? You are both married and need to leave the past in the past. Arranged marriage or not. You both took those vows now you need to own them.|`|AA11025973	Its lust AND infidelity!|`|mAZi1eH7aa	Love?, No. Like and lust, yes. But you are married and should try to maintain that relationship. The could haves and should haves are not important. The future is.

I mean, is she going to do something with it or does she just want to have one? If the answer is yes, then I guess you need to do what you can to make that happen. If she just wants to be a college-lifer then it's reasonable to ask her to stay where the money is good & go to school locally.|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	You two didn't talk about this possibility before you got married?<br>  I think you both need some couples counseling on better communication-- unless she just sprung this on you.<br>  Then I'd say, yes, I'd be really upset!|`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	You assumed you would be in the same place to start your lives together.....what you assumed is that would be where YOU wanted it to be, and apparently you assumed wrong.|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	I would be mad as hell.

Can you move with her?|`|b7raN3sbaa	Yes.|`|AA11025973	I would be pretty upset too!

Support her now and she'll love you forever.|`|sw6FLjlPaa	Yes. i agree with you. Both parties have to start a live together - not separately. <br>  First mistake - both of you should discuss this before marriage.<br>  Now, already married, then she should respect how you feel about moving away. <br>  Would that be a financial problem if she don't move away ? Would you able to support her totally if she stay ? This is an important question too. If you are not able to, due to 'necessity', she might have to upgrade and get a better paid job etc. But, i still think she should respect ur feeling. <br>  Or, you can move with her and get a job there.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Yes you should be upset why did she marry you just to move away let me guess she has a mind of her own and she is going to do it with or without your approval.|`|WFZWlGA0aa	u got into this together she should be willing to work out whatever ur interests are into hers and vice versa if u two can't work some thing out together let her go. personally though i would be upset|`|ExBaodthaa	I would be upset too... but why not just go with her?<br>  i don't think you should be apart from eachother. Especially not now that you're newlyweds.
1rmSuG2Haa	First off, 'growabrain' -- that's exactly what you need to do. You have been reported for your VERY INDECENT comment. I hope you never become a parent if you think like that. As a mother myself, you sicken me.<br>  <br>  To OP: Getting a small gift for her son would be so cute, and do that if you wish.. but I would only give her a small gift for the first date, not her son. I know where you're coming from (an accepting stance), but instead of a gift for him.. spend time with him, hold him, bond, etc. And save the gift for him for your second meeting.. <br>  <br>  Dress normal.. casually and however you normally are. Always be yourself!! You could take her to a park, dinner is always nice (it breaks the ice ALOT), or somewhere else near by that is pretty relaxing but fun. I don't really know where you live so its hard to say. =)<br>  <br>  I really applaud you for being so accepting of her son! As a single mother, we get a lot of rude remarks thrown our way for mostly something that wasn't our fault -- most of us never asked our lives to turn out the way it did, but we work out a$$es off to make it the best it came be, not only for us but for our beautiful child as well. Its a job that never ends and is rarely appreciated.. I adore guys like you!<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck on your date and in your relationship!

I don't think a number says if someone is a skank, i think that is in her personality, the way she carries herself, dresses and talks.  People also change, maybe she slept with alot of people when she was younger but has changed her ways. <br>  As for lying hopefully you can have an open and honest relationship where lying isn't needed.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA12197122	From the start she is a skank because she has slept with many guys, as long as she is fine, GO NUTS!

The risk is in the leap of faith you take, by making the vows and all... will you really love him for the rest of your life?, visa versa on his part... sometimes open lines of communication is key... keep your head up girl! maybe he just needs some time to think about his place in this... talk about things then let it go... dwelling on it will only make things become ackwardly annoying to each of you.,..say whats on your mind let him say his piece, then go on to daily routine...|`|AA10626566	Check out the divorce rate dear - if you are worried about wasting your time then you need to let this man go and find you somebody that is in a hurry.|`|AA10696203	some guys out there r afraid of commintment to his girl. give him some time,dont talk about marriage to him that will make him twice as nervous as he is already. just give him so time to think about. if he still does not talk about it. give him alot of time to think about you and him together. dont worry. he loves you, he just needs to think clearly. stay with him. good luck to ya girl!|`|AA11602203	A good marriage takes great committment and good communication from both parties, you should find out his committment and intention before taking further steps.<br>  <br>  Maybe its time to sit down and have a cup of tea, ask about his goals and his thought of getting marry.  It might just be miscommunication or wrong assumptions that's throwing you off here, you just have to find out for sure.<br>  <br>  See what he say, if he's way off course and just want to hang around; maybe then its time to look elsewhere.|`|AA11223181	Is he worried about the fact that he is going to be with one woman for the rest of his life.  You should ask him how he really feels about the subject.  If he doesn't think you should get married and that you both are just wasting your time then move on.  But if this is just a "test" to see if you really love him, its bogus.  Wouldn't you have already proven your love by not doing anything stupid behind his back, or is it him that doesn't want you to find out?

088f540397bd1af6778d9bc070b31b52aa	If they knew about your pain then i would have expected them to be there for you. But not all people handle situations the way we'd like them too.  Maybe they can't relate to your pain and didn't know how to help you.  Just send them a card with something about friendship on it with your new contact details, if they really are your friends then they will contact you.|`|AA12011005	this has nothing to do with friendship. sorry!<br>  <br>  -------<br>  hi crystal, answering your message, i think it is nice of you to offer friendship, but as you say yourself, you did not get any details from them about what was happening, on the other hand, they didn't call you for a long time and never asked about you. real friendship is about CARING and SHARING. If that does not happen then its just not friendship anymore- as i said previously|`|AA12387166	hmmm|`|AA12381717	I don't know, did they know about your personal pain?  You can't expect them to know without telling them, without ASKING for their help and support.  You may not have heard from your friend in over a month, but I'm sure there's a reason.  Have you tried to contact your friend?  You could just drop the friendship.  That's really a decision you need to make.  I think right now it could go either way.  Either decision could be the better one.  I think first you should talk to your friend before deciding to drop the friendship.  Also, if he or she knew about your problems and didn't help, then that would be a reason to drop the friendship.|`|e9087d68a8ae4fe6ba3ccf788db71ff2aa	Seems to me the friendship has already been dropped.  However, to show you are a bigger person, leave a forwarding address and phone number and leave the ball in their court.

9f15a424661f6b710f2de938c065f047aa	The one thing that I can say that I like most in a man is their unexpected tendencies to be romantic. I would rather that they would surprise me sometimes, instead of me expecting it. I also like the fact that some men can indeed be friends without all the added pressure of entering into a relationship. I also like a well-toned body. Ilike atheletic men. Ilike men who has a nice smile I like the men who are just a little on the shy side too! I find that extremely sexy! What I don't like in a man is arrogance, and conceit. I also dont like men with nasty body odor.  Those three qualities are a definite turn-off!! I also don't like a man who considers himself God's gift to women. I will not talk to them or look their way. But other than that, I basically like a lot of the characteristics in men. They are fascinating to me.|`|AA11820856	I like an independent career minded woman who takes care of herself,  I dislike a lazy complaining woman who thinks everyone and everything around her is wrong but has nothing to show for herself|`|AA12225260	I like a females personality, as long as she is nice, funny, and interesting. but then again, girls are always interesting to me. but if it was a physical thing, i dont know why, but it would be a females breast. the just interest us guys so much, i think because they just stick out there.|`|AA11799495	On a man...his lips!! I love juicy lips!! (maybe that's y I date a puerto Rican!!! lol) I don't really care for feet on any man...or anyone for that matter...I'm not a foot person = )|`|AA12045417	well proportioned body and stands almost like mine height...|`|c9255cfedbe0699e735cdb586baa82e0aa	In a woman I like personality, intelligence, and looks don't hurt.

Once you are with him for awhile you might realize that you don't really love him but you were just crushing/lusting him. Then you can move on to "better" guys.|`|AA12007347	Because he is exciting.

Alot of girls are like that. I find that i get along more with guys, and am attracted to them more, cause they're more outgoing in my opinion. Maybe you should stay away from him... You might find you will lose feelings for him if he isn't around you.. Hope it all works out, goodluck :)|`|AA10727617	aaahhhhh the bad boy phase............................<br>  <br>  i was always a sucker for bad boys when i was younger. it's the thrill of knowing you shouldn't be with him,he seems exciting and all the bad boys are HOT so that plays a major role too.<br>  <br>  i think it's more of a lust thing with bad boys tho, it eventually fades.............................|`|AA11350929	yeah..love is crazy...but you know you must see reality also...|`|AA11530226	how old r u?
AA12381717	Maybe he's afraid of her cheating with you?  Or he could possibly be afraid that you'll make her cheat.  I don't think that could be true though, if you're still talking to this guy.  I'm sure that he just doesn't want his girlfriend to talk to ANY guy.

AA11112418	In general, instincts are pretty accurate. Of course, don't confuse instincts with your emotions.

ab3ccb32d8e22a8a9dfb65a38611c188aa	Cut your ex off. He has hurt you, doesn't want a relationship, and is now potentially ruining your opportunity with someone new.<br>  You need time apart to heal and get over him. You obviously aren't. Ask him to stay out of your life until you are ready (and able) to let him back in. And be strong! It will be hard, but you can do it.|`|68aacafdc597e62ec02ef5b67316c361aa	just relax or u will end up in an assylum!|`|AA11820856	I think he is just jealous, go and enjoy your date|`|AA10783218	he's definitely jealous, because he sees that he cant have his cake and eat it too. he wants you but doesnt want to be with you.|`|AA10895585	gurl u have 2 take it easy listen to ur heart every action u take will make a great impact.be careful gurl.|`|fea4eba205a1f93b02a0357a89c5dcbeaa	Ask him.  If he is jealous, quit hanging around with him.  But it seems as if you have unresolved relationship issues with him anyway.  I don't know anyone that had their heart broken by someone and could to even be in the same room with that person unless they were still holding out a glimmer of hope.<br>  <br>  Go out with this other guy, have a good time, and leave your ex in the past WHERE HE BELONGS.|`|64c1e3e276a8c6bb28b26a5349bd839aaa	go out and bang this new guys balls off and go home and invite your ex over and ask him to lick you|`|AA11192699	If this guy tore your heart apart you need to steer clear of him for awhile. And definitely do not tell him about anyone else you are planning to date. <br>  <br>  He wants to control you because you are his "girl". But in reality slavery was abolished and you do not belong to anyone. <br>  <br>  Go out with the new guy, have a good time and start dating again. Date whomever you like and don't worry about your ex. Definitely stop going out with him. You are setting yourself up to be his patsy.

Yes, his employer probably has an ethics statement that forbids it.  Many people, however, do fall for each other after meeting in a "Position of trust" relationship such as Doctor/patient.<br>  <br>  An ethical doctor would advise you that you will need to find another doctor, because he is developing a romantic interest with you.  <br>  <br>  You should discuss this with him - at dinner is fine.  He should have a reasonable explanation for not doing this - an excuse such as "I wanted to see where this would go first" is not good ethically - if he has ethics problems in this area, he probably has them in others.  If his answer is not making you feel comfortable (and this date obviously isn't or else you wouldn't be asking this question), you need to find a new date - and a new doctor.<br>  <br>  The principal of not dating someone you are treating is to protect the patient from feeling that she/he is obligated to do what their doctor asks in order to get proper treatment.  There are unscrupulous professionals out there who really take advantage of this.<br>  <br>  That is not to say this is the case for your doctor - perhaps he only saw you on an emergency basis, and he is not your ongoing primary doctor.  If so, he will tell you this.<br>  <br>  Do bring it up -|`|AA10224833	Maybe he has some medical news for you.<br>  <a href="http://www.amithefox.com/view/gina.html..." rel="nofollow">http://www.amithefox.com/view/gina.html....</a>|`|AA11123474	No he will not get in any trouble. Its totally fine!!!|`|AA11648574	if you like him change doctors and go out with him|`|a878a124f1f7319b10065177dd0551ebaa	he wont get in trouble unless you say something.  I am sure the hospital discourages dating patients, but probably can't prohibit from doing it so unless you complain to the hospital i doubt there will be any problems.

AA11472558	My BF is 20 years older (I'm 27) and I can't imagine my life without him. We are on the same level in so many ways - maturity, goals, opinion, etc. Like any relationship, it comes down to a balance of give & take, acceptance, and respecting each other.

It is sort of like a life struggle with them. Good luck in your search.|`|0c1368e835c84c0b43adbbc257af8cbeaa	they dont get into relationships looking for a jerk, it just happens. i want a nice guy, its just the more attractive ones meaning the ones w looks, charm, money, status, and other charateristics happen to be jerks. not all of them, just most of them. the more attrative ones know they have more going on for them. so of course they will run through more women. hopefully women will get hip to the game.|`|71e06694eda642d966c9995e4bb78958aa	doesn't bother me any.

Good luck, if your not in a rush, you'll find the ideal mate later.|`|b3a539147cac0beb590fdcbb2fa03383aa	You will never get a true answer to this. Bad boy images have attracted women since the 50's. Pictures of the guys with cigarettes rolled up in their t-shirts riding on Harleys, have been replaced buy big chains wrapped around their necks, rap music and clothes large enough for two people to live in. <br>  <br>  "Nice guys finish last" didn't become a cliche by accident. Young girls want excitement, adventure and its not until they become women that they want stability, a foundation to build a future.|`|AA10665652	Because we nice guys are better, for them.

I think so.|`|AA11516886	because there is always a chance that "super hot woman" might really be a man who was on MAURY.....|`|AA11820856	Well my first thought would be that she is already taken, super available women are very scarse unless they just broke up and got out of a relationship and then they show alot of rejection because they think all guys want one thing which in alot of cases is true.  But you do have those guys with alot of self esteem and think they are the class and go for it.  If you observe real close to the attempts made at her it will tell you if you should fear rejection or not|`|AA12380098	for me it was fear of rejection until i realized it was their loss.|`|cd4f2d8a5e9ea0ebd65c09838a03601faa	Guy's assume she's she either has a boyfriend or is stuckup and will shoot them down honest if you aren't Mr.Baywatch hunk you are not in her universe she'll give you the evil eye not to come within 20 feet of her. Super hot woman have extremely high standards in the quality of the men looks wise they'll talk to it doesn't matter if your a nice guy and have a great personality brains etc she is narrow minded in her choices.<br>  <br>  Forget her and move on......|`|f21dd438e412e4eeba9ca20901e38e61aa	Yes.
AA12236052	Lol I am like that. I am the kind of woman who one minute I have a good mood and the next I feel something else.<br>  <br>  Remember that women have insecurities and aren't perfect. Sometimes we have a lot of things in mind and we aren't in the mood for socializing or talking to boys.<br>  <br>  Personally when I am in stress and a boy talks to me I let him know that I am not in the mood for talking. I could avoid men at times., and I feel bad about it but I give more importance to the things I have to do at the moment.<br>  <br>  I know is bad but humans in general are complicated......<br>  <br>  Or are they insecure.<br>  Not in the mood to flirt.<br>  Stress.<br>  Or they know you are attracted to them but they don't like you that way and don't want any compromises with you.<br>  Or just shy, its easier to be in a group than being alone, I can get a little nervous and don't know what to say when I am alone with a guy.<br>  <br>  This guy I like can be in a group of friends hanging out, and it's easier for me to joke around with him and get to know him better.<br>  <br>  But when I am alone with him I get quiet, nervous, shy, afraid to say anything stupid or too personal that he might tell his friends. Guys can be assholes. I end up avoiding him sending him the wrong message that I am not interested when I am.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also women tend to change their minds a lot. <br>  <br>  I am conscious of my acts and feel bad about it :/|`|005288c38efe86540b162d28d8cd15c5aa	If she is with a group, you have to build a rapport and break her away from the herd.  That is the first step to picking her up.|`|301faff7fd14117119a8ee18c533419aaa	I would say that the reason they seem unconscious of it is because it is simply their true personality. Not all women are like this but it seems as if these are the ones that men notice first. I've got a lot of guy friends that I've asked why they complain about women being b*****s when those are also the only ones they go for... and the answer? Its exciting even though it's miserable too. So kinda the same thing... and maybe women have learned that this type of behavior is what gets them the attention. Don't we learn that almost from birth?? I've also noticed personally that if I've spent the extra time to look absolutely GREAT and feel CONFIDANT and SEXY, no matter how outgoing I am a lot of men avoid me... yet if I yank my hair into a ponytail, pull on a pair of jeans and a tee shirt with no makeup men will give me "that look" just in passing without my having to say a word to them. Don't know if this answer helped... I understand the behavior but it's tough to explain...|`|9d6db9d2edaf971f5cad71e0723fff02aa	we men like the challenge|`|AA11820856	I would say they do it to set up a defense measure to keep weirdows from flaunting all over them and to keep an awkward confrontation from happening
c4c076d18c393c85ac4670f33ac25ad5aa	You can become active in thing's that girls are active in. Go to places where girls are. Be in a club, a sport outside of school that girls might be in. Talk to girls. Go to parties that girl would be at. Ask boys at your school how they meet girls and if they have girlfriends. Do you have any friends at your school? You could ask them what you should do and how to meet girls.|`|019399666c2d8873568a87834ff2e74caa	I go to an all boys school to, i met my girlfriend through dances, football games, and just hanging out on weekends.  meet one girl and she knows more.|`|9a287d6872699a5f36adbe1800d7ec6daa	Go to a ALL - GIRLS High school!!!

I prefer 'lean' and edging towards 'skinny' or the 'athletic' build.

They look as if they have stepped from a mould, they seem to have the individuality to match, and when they open their 'maaths ta speak, they fink nufink awf anyfink cept drink n sex,' and they have the same breadth and capacity for conversation as an 8 year old.<br>  <br>  So, there is a balance to be struck somewhere in all of that.|`|AA11820856	to each their own, everyone has their own style and perception of the perfect woman|`|0d11d9baa89a8a31e162ca3959de0150aa	that all depends on if you're a size 14 and under 5'5" as this can be considered by some as unhealthy and overweight.<br>  <br>  If your body looks in proportion then there is nothing to worry about.<br>  Nothing wrong with being a size 14 if as i said you have the height to carry it off, but short and big top me is a turn off, but some guys are attracted to that. each to there own as they say.<br>  personally if anyone has seen the TV show less than perfect, there is the skinny Andrea Parker who looks like she needs to eat a few good meals she is just a bag of bones, where as Sara rue is looking mighty good, but the actress who plays Ramona, I'm sad to say looks like she has eaten all of Andrea Parker's meals.<br>  <br>  don't shoot me just my opinion.<br>  <br>  basically it's not the dress/ clothing size on it's own it really does depend on the height and other proportions of a girls body.<br>  <br>  it also depends on her personality. a skinny girl can be great to look at but evil to be with. but you can find some slightly larger girls can still be great to look at but her personality is better (used only for expression here no derogatory intent meant). basically they just love life and that can make a girl more attractive as a result.<br>  <br>  girls always obsessed with dieting for example can be a turn off.|`|8ba2a8b4ae00a84c3931f81708d8f413aa	dont thnk so...|`|a57866c69f5c7e2dc2febff1b13d8967aa	No, not at all, I personally like a woman to have a bit of meat on them ;)|`|acba8c65e4cdebbf9dda8da0a1aa7f1faa	Honey, you are a beautiful woman.

AA11820856	I believe that is a silly question, who cares if he cares for the teacher.  The teacher is there for a purpose of teaching and nothing else.  They have student counselors for other things|`|AA11629871	dmxdragon2 makes a very good point.  What is it with all these people posting on here lately about student-teacher relationships?  Students should never have any type of relationship outside the confines of education with a teacher.  Even in college, if someone likes their professor, they should wait until after they no longer plan to take any classes taught by said professor to broach the subject of any type of relationship outside of education.  I would even say this should include friendships, but I especially mean it for romantic interests.  I also don't believe it matters what country someone is from when saying this.  The teacher's job is to teach, & that's it.  This friend should only treat the teacher in a professional manner, ask questions when he requires clarification on his studies, & accept any constructive criticism the teacher may provide so as to learn from his mistakes.<br>  I have to wonder if students trying to date teachers is a common practice in other countries, since I've seen so many posts to that regard.Is this common where you live?  I know it has happened a few times her in the U.S., & the teachers are brought up on criminal charges when its discovered.  Ironically, this is becoming the most common form for child molestation, statutory rape, & corruption of minors to be committed by women.|`|AA10465391	i dont unerstand

If you and this man are meant for each other, trust me things will work out like they are supposed to without you even having to do anything. If he is a good father that won't change just because he isn't there. Sometimes it really turns out worse if you try and keep someone there when they feel they don't want to be. It creates a lot of tension, and also a lot of resentment towards the other spouse down the road. The point is don't make this man do something he really doesn't want to do. If he feels he has made the mistake of leaving you and the kids then maybe what he needed was time like this to think it through. I think he could have done a better job of telling you he was leaving, but you can't change that right now. All that you need to do is come to an agreement with yourself and know where you want to be in your life with or without him.|`|AA10959632	if he left you with no money and a bunch of debt, how is he a good father. good father's provide for their families.|`|9a8f99d2fed2aacd9c7d9e8d255c1703aa	let him cool down himself,he might be thinking of a solutions.for the time being, ask family members to clip-in to help out with the daily bread & butter affairs for the childrens which utmost important.|`|AA10727617	forget about him!<br>  <br>  how is he a good dad when he left you to look after his kids with no money and and a stack of bills?<br>  <br>  only speak to him about the kids, otherwise, forget the loser!|`|AA11707323	He left you 2 weeks ago with no money and $1000 in bills and only calls once in a while late at night.  Now call me stupid but I dont see where he is a good dad.  A good dad would be there for the kids, make sure they have money to eat, make sure the bills are paid so electric doesn't have to be shut off, and would call earlier so he can speak to the kids.  Your just fooling yourself.  What will you be waiting for ? When will he come back ? When the bills are paid ?|`|AA11820856	Try getting some child support from the guy and while at it have them make him pay those bills.  After all they are his kids to.  Sounds like another dead beat dad case.|`|f653ccdb7d8d6797242e0c56b9643bddaa	try to analyze the whole situation before deciding on anything. You said he left, was it for good, or he just left for a period of time and will be back with you soon? if you meant that he really left you for good, then there must be a reason behind it and you must think about it seriously. If it can still be resolved by talking to him, i suggest you try it first, i'm sure you don't want your kids to miss their daddy so if you have the heart the accept him back, that is if he returns... then all you have to do is follow your heart.

AA12070421	she is doing stuff she dosent have any time for you and she dosent even bother to call|`|AA10835024	If she loses interest in sex with you.|`|AA11820856	A good sign is when she isn't longing for the attention she used to crave from you.  She is probably getting that satisfaction else where.  And if she becomes kind of distant and not so frequent she probably has found someone else or at least has someone on the back burner|`|4725309d2eb6a2cbc52fb2707b23d4c3aa	Deep down inside U already if she is or not, U just dont have solid concrete proof.  Here's a GOOD way too tell, if she has a change in routine, such as, either she calls more or even less than ususal.  If she tries new things sexually that she never had an interest in.  If she goes out more without U.<br>  Like I said though, U can usually have some indication by her actions, or the way she touches or kisses U.|`|AA11196457	if she is really quiet and when you tell her you love her she mumbles i love you to very quietly|`|c96d7b65ce293cc94eac0bf51fa0b5d9aa	just tell her that if she did cheat that you would forgive her and then ask the question.
bc7035247d213e35a4aadc035dcf625caa	I disagree with the mustard guy's answer. The maid of honor and the best man toast then if parents would like to toast, it is done right after.<br>  <br>  I did an amazing speech, and it was long and of course I cried during the whole thing... but I got compliments the entire night and am now known as the girl who had that great wedding speech!<br>  <br>  I too went online to get a ton of ideas and searched for weeks, and I got a ton on inspiration and you will too. If I can find my speech when I get home, I'll post it.|`|43fe22f7b04157dae7a820c7007497b3aa	What I did when I had to give a Maid-of-Honor toast was looked at poetry sites that have real poets. Not people on the internet thinking they're poets submitting crap poetry, but real stuff. Then I just went from there. I borrowed phrases (crediting them, of course), then added in something relevant to thier relationship.|`|AA11560122	The best wedding toast comes from your heart . Just think about all the good times and the things that you know so well about these people and it should come out naturally. Good luck.|`|AA10119873	Usually only the best man makes a speech (toast) Make her wedding bagels instead.

0066155469edea395885b74599f25319aa	I know what it feels like.  Even though I'm only 16....I've been through it.  It feels like I'll never "truely" be able to get really close to another girl again.  But I'll say this.........in the time I've been thinking about my problem (same as urs) and talked to others about it......I've realized this.  You need to really think about how you changed from this past relationship........and what you've learned from it.  And take all of that into the next relationship once you're ready.  We need to keep getting up when we fall.....and eventually we'll stay up..walking the path to our happy ending.  The right guy will be the one that makes you trust him......that makes you a believe he can be better then what you had before.  There'll always be someone better out there........they're just harder to find.  But you'll know when you do.  But you'll never find that someone that's better if you're not open to the possibilities of another relationship....and I know it's easier said then done.......but just stay ready for that guy when he comes along...and don't scare him away because your "closed up" still.  We never forget the ones in our past....but you have to move on to the next chapter of your life.|`|AA11988223	I truly agree with you...I'm sort of in that same position...I love someone so very much but he will probably never love me back in the same way...I find it so hard to even think of finding anyone else because I have put so much into this other relationship and it's hard to imagine myself ever meeting anyone else that I could possibly share as much with.  It's not that I'm opposed to meeting anyone new it's just that I have this funny "feeling" that I will never meet someone who I can relate to as well and that I feel as comfortable with...it's scary and sad....I don't want to be alone forever....I would much rather share my life with someone eventually.  It's not even that I need someone RIGHT NOW...I don't mind taking it easy and waiting because I'm not the type of person to rush into things but I just would like to think that one day I will have the chance at someone else....I guess the best you can do is take it one day at a time and hope that someone will cross paths with you when you least expect it....only problem is, I've been waiting for this to happen for the past 3 yrs. and no go.....I hope that you have better luck!!|`|AA11820856	You never find two people just alike.  Just don't get so involved with them so fast.  Take it slow and see what developes and if nothing dose then move on|`|1b0d8128aa5fcc7d7132d360aa2b6d92aa	it just takes time.  i think that fear is always there, but you learn how to deal with it over time.<br>  <br>  a wise man (my father) once told me that you have to take risks to get anywhere in life.  you have to risk getting hurt in order to find love.|`|64fb6cbeb273cd83fbcbd70763c230e6aa	I know it's difficult but the only thing you can do is just risk it.  Nothing, I mean nothing is going to happen if you don't get out of your comfort zone and start seeing people.  If you're always going to be afraid of getting hurt and if you don't start trusting people again, you're going to end up alone.  If I were you, I would have more fear of ending up alone for the rest of my life than getting hurt.  Believe it or not, there are people out there who are honest and trustworthy.  You just have to try harder to find them.  Remember the clock is ticking.  The sooner you change, the better.|`|ddd73dc2393deeee63f3889191e20b7daa	I know. But I guess that you never lose that fear. It will always be there you just have to realize that without taking chance nothing good will happened. If you don't get hurt, betrayed, humiliated at least sometimes in your life you cannot say you are real person. And thats how it is. <br>   "Its your fear that makes you worthy."|`|AA10227894	loosing the fear of getting hurt, is by facing your fears, if you dont learn to face your fears, you will never conquer them, you will be faced with alot of your fears, so take the right attitude today and learn to face them, and no matter what happened you have moved past that fearsome scenerio.

AA11224135	It guess it depends on how aroused you (and your partner) are and if you take your time to change the pace. If you start really slow, and then the mood starts to gain pace, then, for me it usually takes about 15-20 minutes.|`|AA11316529	depends on how tite a grip i got on it|`|AA12162653	I would guess 5-7 minutes for males, and 10-15 minutes for females with direct stimulation!!!|`|e7ac3173334ead1ec8c6084261ba220faa	think of it this way <br>  men are like bottle rockets<br>  women are like deisel engines|`|29478509639e0d3d17d812b37bb20dc8aa	3 minutes|`|42d78c575757c4611c2c90e8030951acaa	why do you want to know that|`|9627d1e277dbd3394c4d31a0291cc315aa	There really is no average; It varies with each person depending on experience, sensitivity, stimulation, speed etc.<br>  In example: My girlfriend, I make her orgasm within the first 2 or 3 minutes mainly probably because of the speeds and force I exude and because shes got very little experience with sexual contact.<br>  <br>  When we first started having sex, I couldnt even go for 2 minutes without her having to tell me to stop because it was 'too powerful'. Unfamiliar Stimuli.<br>  <br>  In another example: Another I was sexing seemed like she was taking FOREVER just to get one!! It wasnt forever, only like 5-10 minutes but the 5-10 minutes seemed alot longer due to the fact I was used to the 1+ minutes it took for my gf. This girl was a bit more experienced and had different level of stimuli than my girlfriend did.<br>  <br>  Last but not least: Another girl I had sex with, I came in less than 3 minutes? Why? It wasnt that I'd been without sex for a while, but her puss felt ALOTTTT different than I was used to. The shape and inner texture created a stimulus that was unfamiliar and powerful to me.<br>  <br>  Stimuli and Sexual Experience in essence is the key to Orgasm Speed.|`|AA11320098	I guess there is an average, but who cares.<br>  Time ranges for me, too. Depends on what he does and how he does it.|`|f2c236d1f0908982d17149793ff730a1aa	When I was younger, it took much longer.  Now that I am older, it can happen in as little as 5 minutes.  You need lots of foreplay, and really be enjoying what you are doing/who you are with...its as much mental as it is physical|`|AA11473291	NO ther is really no average.  Everyone is diffrent with diffrent ranges.  It depends on your sensitivity!|`|AA11820856	That is a tough one because it all depends on the moment and who is giving me the orgasm and how

35246cace40c5190edb37af9f8d9c9f3aa	I'd ask "why not"? I believe in soul mates and I believe theres someone "out there" for everybody. Alot of people may have a different opinion and I feel alot of us just look in all the wrong places and believe what our mind wants and tells us to believe not our hearts.|`|AA12258788	I found mine. So yes, they should.<br>  <br>  I believe in reincarnation, and given that, I think I know what's going on. I think a soul mate is someone you've had a close relationship with in a previous life (or in several previous lives). When you meet up again in this life, the relationship tends to very quickly take up where it left off. If it was a good relationship, that can be marvelous. But if it was a screwed up relationship, you can very quickly end up in a really intense, really screwed up relationship again, and if you don't remember the past life (and most of us don't) then you have no idea why things are happening or why you feel the way you do. So I think there are good and bad soul mates, just like with any other relationship. The soul mate thing just makes it more intense faster.|`|ba224a11f32b389857da275b3704211caa	I believe|`|486ff86a3e8d058cd0226564f6a13f95aa	I don`t know....maybe yes maybe not...but I can say that I have 16 and my boyfriend had 19 and we love each other very much....we can`t image ours life without each other.maybe this is a mode..I don`t know yet|`|AA11432517	First, people should understand what soulmates are. They can be male or female. They are NOT necessarily that "one and only true love". Soulmates are people who come into your life for an important reason or to teach you a valuable life lesson. They can be your best friend, your worst enemy, your Grandma who always understood you or the high school teacher you hated the most. They are the people that stick in your memory because they have played a significant part in you becoming the person you are. A whole and independent person. So that when you DO meet someone who becomes that "one and only true love" you don't smother them with with the silly "it's destiny" or "we are cosmically meant to be" stuff. That person is your best teammate. NOT something to cling your vine to! No one else will fulfill your life. You must do that for yourself and share the results with your partner.|`|f66c7f663b0357830ccae1c8700021baaa	It's a beautiful idea but most time ends up in a worse way. <br>  <br>  I used to have a soul mate, which has a lot of similarities between us. But ends up I blow it, things went wrong and there is no more conversation. <br>  <br>  Ever since, I do not believe in soul mate any more.|`|0ae78e1d495e90a5c4be9f8d45a8b576aa	Why not.|`|12dae85e687929d3cc2b1cb9a985e2acaa	that's an opinion really, its up to you, if you think there is a certain person for everyone, then feel free. But no one could or should be able to make you believe something

AA10114148	First off why are you texting about sex, thats probably why she is not responding, and second, so what if she stuck up about her self, she knows she's worth more than your pathetic attempts at getting her pants, why don't you try being a real man and expressing how you feel about her in front of her face, taking her somewhere she's never been and showing her a good time and maybe she will consider giving you some.|`|313a3c3f7dbb22e40cfba61fa89d8a05aa	If you really only want sex, then you have to do whatever it takes buddy. although i dont find sex the top priority in relationships i have, you should just get on your knees and play along. and dont text her.. call her txting is so childish when it comes to dating|`|AA11056894	forget about her and move on to someone else...there are tons of hot girls that are not dramatic and full of themselves|`|AA11302344	i wouldnt play such games.. be direct if you really want to continue something. or call her, she can't delay much then,|`|AA11820856	Let her date her finger or dildo and move one, you don't need to beg

383e9856d8a50346d0c9c331f9692288aa	I just went through this for three years and have a similar question of my own here.  I found yours when I was looking for answers.  You sound like you feel the same way about him that I feel about her.  My heart goes out to you.<br>  <br>  All I can think about is what could have been.  When she's acting right, she's the most happy and fun woman in the world, and physically more beautiful than what I'm used to.<br>  <br>  But when the lows hit, they're twice as intense as the highs, and they hit with three times the frequency.  I'm always happy.  I'm always content.  I neither give nor want any drama, ever.  But drama and fighting are what she lives for.<br>  <br>  Neither one of us had any particularly good role models growing up.  She was abused by her father, not sexually, but abused very much, and more or less constantly.  For me, it was the same with my mother.<br>  <br>  It made her into a person who never trusts anyone and who is never willing to give an inch or say a simple and sincere,"Thanks."  Or especially "I'm sorry."<br>  <br>  It made me into a person who is happy just to have someone, anyone, and I probably say "Thanks" too much.  And "I'm sorry."  Especially when I'm not the one who did the hurting.<br>  <br>  In our three years, I don't even have a clue how many times we split up and got back together.  I still love her dearly, even with all the agony she caused me.  But I know now that one person can't do all the loving.  It takes two.<br>  <br>  After another four months apart, she looked me up.  She always does when she needs something.  Right away, she brought up our last argument.  As always, she'd been the only one fighting and we both knew it. <br>  <br>  I told her, "I'm sorry for not being sorry.  You'll never change.  I've landed on the back of my skull for the last time.  Peace and love, but goodbye.  I'm not Charlie Brown, Lucy.  No more football."<br>  <br>  I've never dumped anyone in forty-nine years, so it really hurt.  Still, I've moved on.  I have some regrets but I KNOW I did the right thing.  It would have happened again and it would have just kept on happening as long as I kept taking her back.<br>  <br>  One thing I learned with age is, people have no more power over you than what you give them.  I choose to no longer give her that power over me and I know I'll be a lot better person.  And, sooner or later, I'll find a much better woman.  But right now I need some time to heal.   <br>  <br>  I think you know in your heart what is right.  I can't come right out and spell it out for you.  It's your decision.  But, like me, I feel that you're a very kind and generous person and you deserve so much better.  Please, love and respect yourself.  And don't ever, ever, for a single minute think you can't do better than to be with someone who makes it impossible to find peace and love with.  A few arguments are normal and even healthy, within reason.  Anything more than that is just slow torture.<br>  <br>  Do what is best for you.  Peace and love.|`|AA11820856	First you need to get some idea of if he is thinking of you like you are of him.

There are hundreds of great CONDOMS that'll help out with lube and such. Your girl's probably tense too, so make-out enough to where she's asking for it and then try again. Foreplay works wonders. GO IN SLOW. It's not gonna be all gravy the first couple of times and if you just drill it in her, there won't be a next couple of times for awhile, so go easy on her.|`|c537cb6761688aeed28b3548e59afed9aa	use a lubricant and make it gentle. she's probably a virgin. try not to hurt her.|`|e57c82f7b0669b48b5d14e67a86fd315aa	have the "sex talk " with an adult close to you, like your mom or dad, because it sounds like you just don't know what the hell you are doing.|`|fb379a0017eb938b3660352bb992d137aa	"it tight eeh let me force it, get the vaseline it aint a happy scene" lyrics of a song by a ajamican artist so just get some vaseline ok.

I think its more of a question if shes playing you, not is she cheating on you, hope the advice works|`|3fa8c76451ac097cfc9f0493ed007f54aa	She is probably playing you. If she is serious even if it is a long distant relationship she would make more of an effort to tell you where she is and important things happening in her life (ie. having to work in GERMANY!). she may have honest reasons for her msn cancelling out but it sounds a bit suss especailly on your birthday and that she is becoming 'distant' herself. maybe you should talk to her and ask her what is her problem and find out where she sees the relationship. you say you met online, does this mean when you meet up in summer its the first time you two have ever met? or you two just only see each ohter evrey so often? if you two have never met yet, i would consider telling you to not bother with such a girl who doesnt seem to respect you as much as someone who is in a year long relationship too.

8e01d2444d5764b928b8687238a5bed5aa	If it's not the first girl....it probably won't be the last. As to why he wants the phone bill back, she probably told him what you did and that she wants her bill back so that you can't call her family anymore. (really, you shouldn't have done that....those people didn't deserve to be put in the middle of this problem). If you feel you must keep it....make a copy and give the original back. But beware...if you continue to harass her or her family, she could make legal trouble for you.|`|774ca3f8268003f369ce86dde5d94cc5aa	Tear the bill up into tiny little pieces and throw it in the garbage right now.  <br>  <br>  Then ask HIM why he wants it.  <br>  <br>  If your marriage is going to survive, you have to start communicating.   If he won't communicate, then you have to go to marriage counselling.  Go by yourself at first.  The marriage counsellor will help you find the right approach to get him to come along.|`|0c7721d4eded078fe3f8f64e2f7043f4aa	Get rid of the bum! You don't deserve this nor the children. Love is hard but in a few years you'll look back and thank god you got out. She wants the bill and she has told him to get the bill from you no matter what,why? Because it has all the numbers you need to keep up with his cell bill. You have the numbers that she could call him from and probably has called him from. Honey,you are still young,there are men looking for good girls right now,just praying to find a good girl to love
1f13a5e35bd1fd8a7126f0dff2df1504aa	Evidently, he didn't know what he wanted.  He probably wasn't too sure about breaking up with you the first time...... he still liked you,  but thought it was too hard having a long distance relationship.  Then once he broke up, he missed you and decided that it was worth it.  I don't think he ever stopped liking you and that is why he kept flirting.  Otherwise he would have ignored you.  If he does this again, I would tell him "that is fine, but this time it will be permanent"   This very similar thing happened to my daughter and after the third time, she had to let him go because it was just a painful emotional roller coaster. <br>  <br>  Since you are together again, my advice is to play it cool.  DON"T give him your whole heart.... (besides, he doesn't want the pressure of having your whole heart).  Have a life and do things with your friends.   Don't let this guy think he is your everything and don't let him be your everything.  Be the girl that you were when he first fell for you (like you were when  you were just friends- that is the girl he likes).   God Bless you.|`|560e6dfb83e23128e3978105f147122baa	basically because he has a penis|`|0SfuntUZaa	He has mixed feeling one day he wants you the next he doesn't. You never said just how old he is.

You sound like you have your head together where as your wannabe boy friend, doesn't know for sure whats going on.<br>   <br>  Your sure of yourself he's the one causing problem not you. But your paying the price for it. If he is like this during dating what would a long term relationship be like. I love you today but maybe not the next.<br>   Is that what you want, find somebody solid. Somebody you can count on to be their the next day the next year.<br>   <br>  You can do better......Because you got what it takes to make it happen.|`|37l9Oyv9aa	maybe because he knows you too well, if you keep on letting him in all the time, and the next time something comes up he will know your reaction before you even do it. so maybe you can switch it up, the next time something happens surprise him, show him that your in control. good luck|`|U4yfP8nHaa	because you are the one who decided 2 date him.

AA11820856	You could drop some suttle hints for him maybe
2bd83b11c34eb5b8236f74310f8aa7daaa	I'm not quite clear about the time line of the relationship, but if you started dating four months ago and then four weeks ago he tried for the first time to have sex with you, you have a very different view of "moving too fast" than most adults.  <br>  <br>  I'm not really sure how to get him back without sounding desperate.  If he was very interested then, maybe he's still interested but giving you some punishment for what he perceived as you hurting him.  Call him, let him know you miss him and that you wish you'd have spent the evening with him -- if in fact you can be honest saying so.|`|8dd24cf539cb30f8612a1d8137f91806aa	He has made it very obvious that he only wants some butt.

Can you say loser.... don't call him anymore either, it will just be a matter of calling you at convenience and making you chase him... Do you really want to used- keep calling him if you do...|`|cf703fb8371fd97d63ac77a93feb47d6aa	he i think he just wanted to get sum.<br>  watever who needs him<br>   you need someone who can wait for you. <br>  and appreciete ur decisions.|`|344a296cd3d5bc4355da7c1fe02abc81aa	have you ever read that book 'he's just not that in to you' im reading it at the moment i think its a really good investment...|`|5606c86101554f5b3928fb38ed49cc7eaa	I don't think you're on the same page here. He's obviously hiding something. I think that if you pursue this relationship, you're going to regret it down the line. You should move on and not waste any more time and energy on this guy. And I know someone mentioned it earlier but I would suggest reading that book "He's Just Not That Into You" by Greg Behrendt. It's pretty insightful and I found myself laughing out loud a few times.|`|5ee64577344924d9d734b22b402338daaa	Guilt|`|8682fcbc5e91b11cff87c8219c38d70aaa	He's MARRIED for crying out loud, leave it ALONE!!!

When you said no with great reason and he did not call that might have been the red flag to you that he only wanted sex. Now on the other hand he might have as well been embarrassed you saying no with again great reason. So I would pursue this situation like this; call his phone and leave a message that you were thinking about him and restate that you did not say no for any other reason than you do not hop into bed just for sex you do it out of a relationship. That you are interested in him and hope you can reconnect. See where this takes you. If he continues to ignore you this is a red flag. Passionate kissing does not mean passion in ones heart for you. Keep your morals your on the right path|`|d40a96931a9494d67d059fa337c9860eaa	he obviously just wanted to "hit and run" and prolly tried to pretty it up. dont waste your time. im sure you can do better|`|f048f1867648d2046aea3088326c696eaa	this is what i call a hit it and quit it type of relationship so move on|`|AA11820856	Sad to say but I think you are going to have to fess up the booty or you wont get him because that is definately what he was after|`|AA10873647	Forget him...then read "He's just Not Into You."<br>  <br>  The guy  apparently wanted just "one thing" and realized he's not getting it.
cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Go to myspace. If u don't have an account creat one. www.myspace.com its easy. then go to the search, you can type in her name and last name and peoples pages come up and just look to see if u see her pic. If the last name spelling doesn't work, type her first name, and click on the zip code of where she was and enter it. It will give the option for an example. "All people named jen within 50 miles of 04011" Hope this helps, good muck to ya

I don't know what sort of town you live in but there must be some way to get involved; take a ballroom dancing class or join a club in town, or even just if you go to a certain restaurant/bar on a certain day every week people will start to notice and talk to you.  If you are still having trouble meeting people (i.e. women) think about why you might be having troubles being outgoing.  Did something happen in your past that is still holding you back? In that case you will never be able to move forward until you have confronted the issue.  Otherwise, you're golden|`|LbU2BCVQaa	why are you so old?

2e6b7229b082d27fedd5b80b41c8054caa	Ask him for about 15-30 minutes and let him know what's going on while being considerate of his time. Just because you're in a relationship with your best friend now, doesn't mean you can't have that open conversation (at all hours of the night) still. If you lose the very thing that brought you together, things can go very sour. Take my advice...call him!|`|AA12390470	You are not the least bit needy or Klingonish (sorry, that's an attempt to be funny). If you cannot turn to your life partner for help and support when you are feeling crashed then you don't have much of a relationship.

I'm sleepy doesn't cut it when you need reasurance.|`|a1ed696c105afac6c788374119cffd4caa	No i think he should definately give you some time to support you and discuss your problems.

If they are confronted with a problem, they want to be able to do something about it.  To them, just listening is not helping.  I know, I know, we know that's not true, but there you have it.  So I'd say, if your "personal stuff" is something that your boyfriend could actually do anything about, then by all means, tell him about it and ask him for help.  But if you just need to have a good old-fashioned girl talk, then find a girl to have it with.|`|AA12359948	Your being way to demanding,solve your own problems.

bNdMR66Paa	Seems that you do have a thing for him.  Just let him know how you feel in a subtle way.  Be honest.  If you are friends then you should be able to tell him anything.  Ive been there too and i know how you feel.  Im kind of in that situation now.  The only thing I can tell you is have a heart to heart with him, dont be shy, ask him what he wants from you, friendship or maybe more.  But let him know that if he only wants to maintain friendship that its cool too.  Youll find out by being honest things will turn out.

As I see this, the best way for this is either you and your girlfriend sit down with her mom or just her mom and your girlfriend and explain the situation.  I personally dont see too much a problem because its better to do it now where its only been a month, where as it could be 6 months and she finds out for herself.  So its better just to do it now than let it build up because then it will get complicated, but i think it should go fine because if your Girlfriend is as honest with her mom as you say she is, then there will be no problems.
TH94Z8aSaa	first off when you have feelings for someone you don't have to ask yourself. it sounds like you like this guy as a friend and might be thinking he may be a good catch but when you don't even know if you have feelings for him you usually don't. my advice to you is leave things as they are and keep in touch. if it happens then let it be naturally. you might be asking for trouble by seeking it.|`|8531ad23f07efdb2af658b8bf062727faa	sweetheart, you are young....whole life ahead of you..Igot married at 18, am still with her....honeey wait a while|`|4ea312759f0c31e32f205d5717b6d39faa	Ask him to marry you.|`|AA11146833	perhaps you should tell him your feelings are deepening.

Aunque solo tengo un hermano me encantaba hacerle travesuras, el es a?o y medio menor que yo. Cuando eramos muy peque?os (yo tenia 4 a?os) me gustaba agarrar infinidad de animalitos como chapulines, luciernagas, gusanitos, etc. Y como el era muy miedoso se los metia a sus zapatos, cuando se los queria poner pegaba de gritos ji ji ji. Pero aclaro siempre eran bichos inofensivos. Tambien le dije una vez cuando el tenia como 5 o 6 a?os que si sembraba las monedas iban a salir arboles de dinero y cuando las sembro despues fui yo a recogerlas ji ji ji. Pobrecito, pero eran bromas sanas. Buenos tiempos aquellos, gracias por dibujar una sonrisa en mi cara.

Girls are becoming more comfortable with bare boobs at the beach, pool or just lying in the sun or doing things at home...inside or outside, alone or with friends.  In many states (like NY where I live) it's legal for us to be topless anyplace a guy can be, and while few girls stroll into 7-11 topless, many are now going topless at regular "clothed" beaches without any problems greater than the occasional foul look.<br>  <br>  I go to the nude beach so being topless isn't even an issue for me and my friends, and hopefully it will become less of an issue as society comes to realize that there's nothing offensive, immoral, vulgar or frightening about our bare boobs.|`|e91a612877174e3c468d27e043bfb42caa	maybe if guys were more mature about|`|lkN2mQWTaa	its not that there different, its that were not ok with it. its kinda embarrassing for us to be topless. especially what guys go crazy over it and stair like they don't have boobs of there own. pulse if you have small boobs like me its even worse because guys expect more, so you just keep them covered.|`|5c3c6d49134ba912d98633a79f71e057aa	sometimes i wonder this myself, i mean, breast are a thing of beauty|`|AA11146833	I agree with nudie chick about the issue, it's also legal in many areas of Canada and is gradually becoming no big deal for women to go topless.|`|Ct10iMlLaa	You're too young to know.<br>  <br>  Stay in school.|`|vuMxFJJVaa	you bring a good point

Por supuesto que el trabajo de la casa es trabajo como cualquiera, en el ejército nadie va a decir Ah no limpio el piso porque es trabajo de mujer! No sé de dónde serás, pero acá en Buenos Aires los jóvenes están bastante acostumbrados a hacer las cosas de la casa, o porque comparten vivienda con otros de su generación o porque viven solos, o porque también sus madres siempre han trabajado fuera de casa. Entonces si alguno sale con eso es trabajo de mujer, suena antiguo también. Es verdad que debe ser una responsabilidad compartida, y más si otras actividades también están repartidas en forma proporcional. Hay que ver también cómo educamos a nuestros hijos, si hacemos diferencias entre varones y mujeres con las tareas de la casa, o todos son principes y princesas y la única esclava es la madre, eso es horrible también.|`|65dabf4e8162f227e02cf86930b328f8aa	Creo que es parte de la educación de cada individuo, y el haber aprendido a compartir, salí a los 17, y para mi las cosas de la casa son parte de la vida cotidiana.|`|AA11301245	BIEN DICHO!!!

Lo que pasa es que como estamos en una sociedad que aun en el siglo XXI es machista y muchos no soportan la idea de que el matrimonio lo forman dos, y que esos dos tienen la obligación por igual de hacer todo por salvaguardar su situación.<br>  <br>  Esta frase me recuerda aquella que se dice cuando una mujer esta a punto de dar a luz: Esta a punto de aliviarse.  ?Pues de que estaba enferma!<br>  <br>  Pero como ya lo habia mencionado antes, estos son usos y costumbres de nuestra sociedad.|`|rMzV8bFNaa	Todavía hay varios neandertales sueltos por allí, pero no te preocupes que pronto les llega su tiempo de extinción.

Allí vas a encontrar muchas claves que te van a ayudar. Creeme.|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	Bueno la pregunta del millón. Una vez conocí a una mujer que me decía que ella había llegado a un acuerdo, que día por medio le tocaba a cada uno ocuparse de la casa. Pero entonces ella lavaba los platos y al día siguiente él no los lavaba, por lo tanto cuando le tocaba a ella de nuevo tenía el doble para lavar. Cuando se cansó, entonces plato que él no lavaba lo tiraba contra la pared. Para el momento que se quedaron sin vajilla el matrimonio ya se había terminado. Resultado con la violencia no se gana nada, pero veo que con pedir tampoco alcanza. ?Qué pasa si tu no haces nada? Si dices por ejemplo, estoy muy cansada, o lo hago ma?ana, o si no hay nada para comer entonces dices no tengo hambre, y así. Ponte a imitarlo, tal como hace él, y si protesta le contestas: una buena solución sería buscar una mucama, qué te parece o a lo mejor para ahorrarnos el dinero lo podrías hacer tu. Y si dice pero yo no se hacerlo, le contestas: yo tampoco nací sabiendo, o: con la práctica se aprende.|`|873db71ab0bdefe49408bbf302856e1baa	Demuestrale que son un equipo y que se casaron para compartir todo derechos y obligaciones, y si los dos trabajan el debe de ayudarte con los quehaceres de la casa  ya que no eres su sirvienta  y si no te quiere ayudar salte de trabajar.

I am not to sure about the milk bit, but I'm sure its your body getting ready forwhen youmature, when they take the mickyout of you rise to the occation and say well I have bigg boobs but at least I dont have a tiny willy. that will shut them up. good luck sweetheart, and have a super duper dandy day|`|A5pDAWxCaa	Please dont pay any mind to the boys, you sound like a beautiful<br>  young girl and someday you will be a woman dealing with men, <br>  than you will have by than learned the your way,<br>  jim|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	I know what it feels like to be busty with a curvy body, cuz I got one. I wear over laped shirts to decrease the size of my chest so I won't get too much attention. mY MOM doesn't know that I wear 2 bras everyday. But Everybodies different in there own way. I'm not all that happy with my body but I have it so I have to deal what I got. But as you continue to grow your body changes, It probably won't be like that forever. so don't worry about it. I'm 5'6' 110 pounds and have a nice belly, with big boobs. I'm okay with it, I'm also 17 years old. Silly boys like that are going to joke around, cuz there fools like that. <br>  But my advice is to just keep your head up, and walk and be who you are. Just keep a smile on your face at all times. But if the joking gets too annoying and serious just talk to someone about it, like your mom, or someone really close. Your probably very beautiful, don't let someone take that beauty away from you, okay. Well bye!!! :)<br>  Well, bye!!! have a ncie day. :)

So he has given you the opportunity to bail out and go find someone and that he wouldn't be upset if you did.  If your crying you should be crying because you had a boyfriend that was so respectful of you and you don't get that very often.  And besides he said it wasn't the end and there was no one else.  So stop crying and respect him and give him a call once in a while to see how he is doing to let him know that your still around.  Or you can call it quits and go find someone else.  Either way you are not with him right now and it is very respectful how he went about it|`|6a837ae9c1fed73d9a78152ddfe4b038aa	I would just give him more space.|`|02e8329df4c1f7f7a7a0889bf3c781cdaa	don't cry and look at the future  i thing that any relationship does not end with marriage it wont continue .forget him|`|5a5a12b15d141bff7d051309f07596ecaa	From a male point of view I would say he is seeing someone else and is trying to fool you.

I broke it off with him. We had an on and off relationship for a year and 6 months. It was horrible, but I loved him and I was going to stick by him no matter what troubles he was going through. Later it just got to the point where I finally realized that something had to going on and it wasn't just the issues he was having. He said he didn't have time to talk to me, even if we saw each other everyday. Well one day after he told me that, I saw him laughing and talk with his friends. He saw me looking at him, then he stopped and walked off. You can only take so much and when you get tired of it, you'll leave. The choice is up to you, because even if I do give you the advice, it's your choice if you want to listen to me. Follow your instincts.

Don't let him go just yet. eXPLAin the Truth and let him get a better understanding. Cuz  iFU hold all of that in you, and let your special somone to continue to think  like that, then give it a shot. If things don't work out right, and he feels your not honest or anything, then just move on. Atlease you will be happy  that you told the truth. You just wanna make things right  not worse.

d7536939d21a446064950b93cb33fef1aa	Pues honestamente es un gran misterio, yo le he preguntado a mi novio por que lo hacen y no tiene una respuesta que a mi me convenza, pero yo creo que a parte de sexo, es tiempo, las amantes se dedican a arreglarse todo el dia, para él o para otro, estan perfumaditas, se mantienen saludables, los atienden cuando llegan, (tu sabes como los atienden), y sabes por que hacen todo esto, facíl, por que les pagan para que sean asi, y por que no tienen que hacer la limpieza, ni ba?ar a los ni?os, ni hacerle de comer al se?or, ni lavarle y plancharle su ropa y despues de todo eso sentarse un segundo a descansar para luego arreglarse un poco para que el esposo no se enoje por verla fodonga y para no darle un motivo para que se pueda enojar, despues de eso se olvida que estaba linda para él, por que él, ni lo noto, (venia cansado),y darle de cenar,  lavar trastes, y ademas complacerlo sexualmente por que si no lo hacen, entonces tiene otro hombre, !puedes creerlo?, por eso existen las amantes que no son mas que basura, sin dignidad ni amor propio, que se dan el valor de ser "la otra"por que estan concientes que nadie las querra para nada serio, la verdad es que dan lastima y por eso los hombres las buscan, por que no valoran a la que en un momento adoraban, por tontos e insatisfechos.|`|FTy5relaaa	no amor en parte vos te equivocas quizas tenga razon yo soy soltero y quiera un mujer estable con relacion seria eso de sexo si lo permitis es bueno porque los precisamos uno del otro respondeme vos si me equivoco besos|`|a39f77aaf83c84439292ba65fd004d3faa	Y te parece poco?

He does like you. He's just flirting with you, and trying to get you to ask him out. ^_^|`|KVAADzB1aa	hehe.......... for sure he really likes you a lot.......|`|bNdMR66Paa	I think he likes you and the things he does that makes you think he is mad seems to me like he gets a little bit jealous.  He sounds to want all your attention.  Maybe he thought you didnt like in anyway except for a friend.  He acts like he is throwing hints your way.  I can understand about being hurt again.  Maybe he is afraid of the same thing.  You should just have a heart to heart with him and be honest with him.  He is your friend and will remain your friend no matter what.  The best relationships come from being friends at first, because when you start dating as a couple then you already know everything the other person likes and wants.  Be honest and dont be afraid to tell him how you feel, even the parts about being hurt again.  He is your friend he will understand.|`|sjlQj4ihaa	To be honest I think you're reading much to into this situation. If a girl hands back his jacket saying it's to big, then he thinks to himself "oh it was to big" and that's it. And calling to ask for homework isn't like calling someone to talk. I have to say that no I don't think he does like you.

But this does not mean that you will not find your choice.<br>  <br>  Have confidence in yourself and do  not rush with your decisions so quickly.Proposing is different but actual understanding of a person,his family background,his habits,his likes and dislikes are very necessary to understand before you commit yourself.The person you feel is made for you,he should also feel in the same manner that you are made for him and this may take sometime to reach a conclusion.<br>  <br>  If God has created you HE has definately created a match for you as HE has created you.Do not lose heart,have faith in HIM and also in self and wait for the right moment.If I can be of any assistance anytime,do not hesitate to write to me as a child,as a friend.<br>  <br>  May God bless you with happiness and peace.It is never too late.All good things happen with sometime and with a bang.|`|70fe0e556bb818f4ed210790de9618fbaa	Hi Pooja.<br>  I have passed through the same state of mind few years ago.<br>  <br>  I had a pressure from my family to find a suitable girl and get married. I was confused what to do. Shall I wait for a girl of my choice or just compromise and carry on with their choice?<br>  <br>  But I decided to wait. I was only 23 at that time. Soon I realised that external beauty is just attraction. Not love. After two years of waiting and looking for right girl, I found that love of my life was just around a corner. She might not be very beautiful for others, but for me she is.<br>  <br>  Well I got carried on in my own story...<br>  I will suggest you to wait for some time and look for the guy who loves you more than himself. Remember, physical beauty might be just an illusion.|`|9838f732245391f5c52ec236c1161f4baa	Do not worry .22 is not that much old.In America nobody want to talk about getting settled down until 35-40.|`|3122ae6f8b98a3cf8f31941e30e7d8deaa	will be some adjustment, but only some and not in basic

Just think of how he probably feels having to move so much like this. His life is pretty rocky. It would be really hard to move that much ... making new friends each time. Maybe he has disconnected because it hurts too much to make friends and then lose them.<br>  <br>  Try not to judge him. If I were you, I would write to him again and apologize. Tell him how you feel ... that you were sad when he first moved and again when he moved again. Let him know that you understand it must be hard to move so much, but that he always has a friend in you.<br>  <br>  He may not respond, but you can't control that. It will be enough that you've done what you can to try to make his life a little better ;-) <br>  <br>  You sound like a really good friend! Those are hard to come by.|`|kCL6sKwAaa	Ask him straight up. If he don't answer you, then get rid of him and devote your energies to people who deserve it.<br>  <br>  People come and go in life. some are worth fighting for, but it sounds like you've done enough fighting. Put an end to it with a final confrontation. Tell him it's a 2 way street to be friends and if he don't want it to just say it. Then you can be free either way of the emotional hang ups he's giving you.

If your to shy then have a friend do it for you or you can write him a note. If he likes you have to wait until he's ready to ask you out. I don't think theres anyway to make him ask you out faster and i dont making him jealous is the best way to go. He'll think you don't like him and never ask.

Hay gente que le cuesta dar, sea lo que sea. Si va a ser un avaro también con el cari?o, con el tiempo libre, con el sexo, si no va a querer compartir sus cosas contigo, es decir si no te incluirá en actividades en común, si es celoso de sus amigos y de su familia. Tienes que asegurarte que el te otorgue un lugar primordial en su vida. Otra cosa es que tal vez le asigne un valor distinto al dinero que el que le das tu. Para algunas personas el dinero bueno es sólo el que se guarda y el que se gasta, salvo para lo indispensable, es un desperdicio. También podría ser una virtud, si sabe administrarse podría ser beneficioso, pues tal vez a ti no te importe tanto gastar en cosas que a lo mejor no sean tan necesarias y él sea muy cuidadoso y medido y entonces podrían complementarse muy bien.<br>  Fíjate en algo: él gasta sólo para sí mismo? Se compra cosas para él sin problemas pero es avaro sólo con los demás?

It's a little awkward to be sitting in a restaurant all alone. But places like Starbucks are full of loners. It may be just out of habit, but sometimes the lunch hour is the only time that friends get to see each other, especially once they have families and such. After work, most people have to go home to take care of their families, leaving little time to see their friends, unless they want to hire a babysitter, but that can get expensive. The lunch hour is good because kids are still in school, and you have a full hour off from lunch!

Let life and friendships happen. Excuse this possibly false judgement based upon your typing style, but you are young. Relationships happen, people change, people grow up. Life always goes on.

Maybe he realizes that he had it made before with you once he tasted someone else and realized it wasn't so good.  Take is slow and see if anything developes.

I honestly dont think u "slipped" and told her that u were going to propose to her.  I think u did that to see what kind of reaction u would get from her.  I dont think u got the reaction that u were looking for and now u want to know what to make out of the reaction u did get.  Only thing to do is as u wrote, give her space and time to figure out what she wants in life.  Do u know the saying "if u love something set it free if it comes back its urs if it doesnt it never was"  Time to step back and see what life brings..  Good luck!|`|fe5368f0da1c0f1f2844e733e4603ec1aa	I am sorry to tell you this, but she cried because she doesn't want to hurt you.<br>  She might not be IN love wit you anymore but she still does love you (you shared a long time with each other)  There is a big difference.  She started to cry because she doesn't want you to get your hopes up and hold onto something that isn't there anymore.  As for the talking all the time thing, that is simply because she is trying to slowly ween you out of her system.  If the situation is that you have talked but not really seen each other then that is exactly what she is doing.  She cannot cut off all contact but is trying to do it slowly for the both of you.

zAkPpIjaaa	wow, yeah thats tough..i know. If shes telling you that shes trying to give her relationship a chance you should let it be.. i mean, i know thats hard because you guys are good friends but try to minimize the calls maybe? I don't know..<br>  Sooner or later something will come to a head. I was in your shoes for a while..and then the guys gf noticed we text eachother and starting calling and txting me. I didnt fight with her though and didnt respond to her..at all. I really dont need any drama in my life nor do i want to cause any in his. That was almost 2 weeks ago..I havent heard from him since which makes me really sad...but..i think..with those situations if its meant to be..they'll find you, when the time is right. Try to move on. ..before some drama starts

Muchos están separados y quieren rehacer sus vidas. Además tienen un buen nivel económico, pues si no la agencia no los acepta. Lo único que te juega en contra es estar desesperada. Porque de ese modo ni siquiera los hombres que tengan buenas intenciones se sentirán atraidos por vos. La desesperación se percibe, y nadie quiere estar con alguien desesperado.

AA12076287	I left me hubby a couple of times.  I am to the breaking point again.  He never spends time with me and wants to always drink.  I fell out of love with him a long long time ago but he has 3 boys and i am extremely close to his youngest and everytime i leave he has him call me and ask me to come home.  I hate to hear him cry on the phone and stuff so i do come home for the sake of the boys.  I know that is the wrong thing to do but i feel obligated to him and his children to make a better life for them than what i had growing up.<br>  <br>  he is very verbal abusive to me and has been more times than i like to count physical abusive to me also.  he hasnt hit me in a long time but that is not the point.  This is a very bad marriage and nothing can help me now. <br>  <br>  Now a question for you...if you were in my shoes what would you do??? There is no love coming from me and we have been married for 7 yrs (yesterday was our anniversary)  I work 2nd shift and need the money to find another place and all so i didnt take the day off but we agreed to spend today together and he wentt to a party and drank and is at our river lot now and he is drinking...I dont drink hardy cuz of the medicine i am on and i asked him if i could go and he said i wouldnt enjoy myself.  What would you do???<br>  <br>  <br>  If your relationship isnt as bad as mine then i suggest that you really try hard before she makes a decision that will affect you 2 for the rest of your lives and she may regret it later in life!!!!|`|74b8e2112eb9bf55a9922b3beaa39f53aa	give her some space she will come aound she's just punishing u..as u said that u had said somethings u regret and she may just reget threating divorce..i hope u didnt call her a whore or a *unt..if so ur in trouble|`|AA11424108	I have been married for 12 years...together for 14. We did seperate 5 years into our marriage due to an affair. I think time apart as painful as it is can help 2 people get their heads clear. Time away from one another gives each of you the opportunity to evaluate what you want from your lives with each other.|`|AA12287228	Yes i have been through a seperation, and nearly divorced from him, we seperated for 3 weeks, and he came home, and we moved away and started over, it works better, if you move away, so that they isnt any drama interfering|`|AA12348089	It sounds like play got out of hand and her feelings were deeply hurt.  Perhaps, if you truly regret saying what you did, then make it up to her.  Send her flowers with sweet sincere notes.  Talk with her.  I'm betting she wants to know why you even thought to say certain names and she might be having a hard time getting over it.  Muster every confidence that you have and go to her.  I do wish you the best|`|005195abbadbd94f03e23f5fd0500c95aa	I currently 8 months pregnant and separated from my husband.The last time we talked was in July and I haven't heard from him since. I am wondering if he will come back or not. I have come to the conclusion though that you have to really look deep down into yourself if you really want her back you have to be completely honest about everything and hopefully she does the same. My mom tells me "if you love someone let them go, if they come back to you they are yours, if they don't , they never  were"good luck!|`|531973e51c8d650788d208bbfef9e283aa	My husband and I used to be too busy to have any time for each other and got seperated for 2 weeks and got back together after seeing a counselor but it has to go both ways- its like a bridge -go on some dates|`|75596cc3f3996b7bd0cca8f86002a229aa	If she loves you she would come back.  She may not be ready to settle down again and may be enjoying being finding herself.  My husband has tried to get me back and he has.  Don't worry after seeing the other guys out there she would come back to you.  Try to keep your lips moist, mouth dry and wear nice colonge.  Do some facials and cream your skin everyday.|`|96799290cc3b65fdd41ed81d5641f95faa	I would say starting for apologize for the things you say to her, pride won't take you anywhere if you want her to stay... Offer her to go to counseling, and star impressing her like when you where dating, invite her to a nice restaurant, send her flowers... and if you are broke (like I see in the other q that you ask) make her love notes, send her love emails, use your imagination, but don't stop....All this things worked with me, and my husband and I are together again|`|AA11461908	What caused the separation?<br>  <br>  I have been separated for over a year now. My husband has tried many times to get me back but every time I give him a chance he screws it back up. Now I'm ready to file for divorce.<br>  <br>  Basically it depends on what is the reason for the separation. If it's forgivable then you may have a chance. Just be a man of your word.|`|AA11827090	yes.6months.he made promises and didnt keep 1.|`|AA11852960	Why did you separate?  Need more info. to answer your question.|`|d60a80b5cc492392701bfef472d33f7daa	Been seperated a few times,,<br>  <br>  ask her what she really wants ,, does she want to talk to a theraphist and try to work it out,, does she just want some time to think and be alone??  Or have you done something horrid that can't be forgiven?  Just lisen to her,, and try not to judge her thoughts and feelings and not  make her see your point of view just lisen to her.|`|AA11895295	A seperation is a terrible thing to have to go thru, i feel for ya, been there and it didnt work out, sounds to me like she may not want it to work out.  Talk to her, but straight up with her and tell her to be honest with u.  Ask her if she would be willing to go to marriage counseling, but remember both of u have to want this marriage to work or counseling is useless!!|`|c8f0d177c40af93976ecb08f65f16a4daa	i'm sure it will be fine.. if she left over name callin and already threatening divorce.it seems that theres something more to it,than you realize..and you need to tell her that.and every effort and apology that you've already given her,,and she still want except it,,maybe you dont need her begin with,,you also need to tell her that too.you've done what you needed to do,now the balls in her court..but dont wait months until she decides..you need to let her know.|`|a1b6b5962587dcb80b0e16d346f15ac8aa	If it really was something as trivial as name-calling, it should be something that can be resolved.   You need to talk to a therapist separately & together.   Establish some ground rules about what is & isn't acceptable in your marriage.   And then stick with the rules.  Sounds silly, but it makes a difference.  I've been married 15 years & those rules have pulled our butts out of more than a few arguments!

Isn't it a bit too early to start planning for a February event?|`|ecb124175a6b4c1c0299bcadd0ae15d2aa	It is way to early to be thinking of Valentines Day
a3a2a0341a781c7dd01b3b190772e66baa	Cyber-sex is fine under most circumstances, except when it is seving to avoid "real - life" over the long term. Have you ever had person to person sex?<br>  In general learning about someone though exchange of words and ideas is an "old fashioned" way of getting to know someone. In the old days snail mail was used and simply took longer in between exchanges.<br>  Cybersex is certainly safe sex. If you are young (and not legal) this is probably the safest way for you to explore your wants and needs.Sometimes people just feel more uninhibited with cybersex.<br>  I guess it is important to know if you are feeling guilty about this or have some other negative questions you haven't made clear. If so , those questions should be added, since cybersex may not be the central concern of your question.|`|cebea3a8e8113acc7b540c298907a6c7aa	No, do I really need to give an explanation as to why? You already knew this answer. Please don't try and get some freak-a-zoids permission. It's as empty as the sex you want to have.
mJmG3i4Oaa	Yes I hate those situations. Its like the guy you like is just as fustrated as you are. Ignore all those immature friends and other people of his that makes comments. Let it go. If things aren't going to work out right between you two then don't waste your time. You did the right thing explaining how you feel. It takes alot of courage to do that. I would of did the same. But if the guy you like isn't on the same page as you, and isn't going to make right choices then let it go. He must be either embarassed or feeling ashamed or something. I'm not sure. But I hope my advice and comment helped u in anyway. Bye!!!
AA12143403	thanks for the warning; there are way too many perverted and sick people out there trying to get a laugh or mess around nowdays...glad to know there are still some sweet guys out there|`|6d678312b5f059fd5c49c429ac571becaa	Don't click on NONAME!'s url's!|`|AA11820856	thanks|`|40fb7149500145c2aa3349080d776bd9aa	Big Nasty Trucker has a few ID's <br>  Big nasty Trucker is a whimp that spreads viruses in his questions by links. <br>   Big Nasty Trucker ID has been discontinued. He now has taken the ID's...<br>  <br>  Just good folk (2 ID)<br>  Yahoo administration<br>  Not suitable for yahoo<br>  NoName- this one has been discontinued (just found out)<br>  <br>  These are the ID's i have so far....<br>  <br>  the real justgoodfolk is at level 4 and he has been avid in briging big nasty trucker down. if you look, he uses "just good folk" as two ID's and answers his own questions. you will know the fake justgoodfolk because he is at level 1. he is crazy and really needs psychiatric help. he responds to questions about himself and makes you click on a link to get rid of his own virus, but the link is still a virus. he gets pleasure out of this and loves the attention.
75db27ff062adf2cfdde04e32fb3c1ccaa	There is only one way to find out. Tell him that you don't have the money to put gas in your car. And that you can't come and see him. Wait and see how he responds.<br>  <br>  See if he offers to come and pick you up. Or see if he offers to give you money for gas.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also maybe he thinks that you only want to be with him because of the money. He's probably looking for a women who wants him and not all his money.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't think you should be asking him for a dime of his money for you finanical needs.<br>  <br>  You aren't married to this man. He isn't responsible for your bills.<br>  <br>  And as far as taking you out for dinner maybe he is trying to see how you react to him not spending money on you.<br>  <br>  He is looking for love. He is looking for someone to share his life with but he doesn't want a greedy *****.<br>  <br>  If he wanted someone to just **** he could afford to buy one for the night. I'm sure that there are plenty of women out there that would bend over backwards for him if it meant he would give them money.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think that this guy really likes you. But I also think that he is testing you. He wants to see where your loyalities lie. With him or with his money.<br>  <br>  Don't ever ask him for money at any cost. No matter how broke you are.<br>  <br>  When he calls and wants you to come over and you don't have the gas to get there be honest. Say baby I don't have the gas to make it there or the money to put gas in my car.<br>  <br>  And then say to him if you want to see me tonight then you will have to come and pick me up and bring me back home.<br>  <br>  and wait for his response..<br>  <br>  He will either agree to come and pick you up or he won't. And chances are if he wants to see you bad enough he will. And there is even a possiblity that he will offer to put gas in your car if you have enough gas to make it there.<br>  <br>  But if he doesn't offer either of these things try not to get up set. <br>  <br>  Tell him you will give him a call when you have the gas to make it over. See what he says then.<br>  <br>  He could just be being cautious of his money. Or you could just be a booty call though i find this highly unlikely seeing as other women would do this for him. And he would call them instead of you.<br>  <br>  Try to pretend that you don't like or want or need his money and I guarntee that he will start spending some of it on you when he finds out that you aren't just in it for the money.<br>  <br>  Even when he starts to spend it on you tell him that he shouldn't have. Let him think that his gifts can never give you the satisfaction that he can but let him know that the gifts are heart felt because they are from him and not from the price he payed for them.<br>  <br>  Get to know the man before his money. Make the effort with him not his money. and in the end you may find your self happy and in love, with him and all that he has to offer.<br>  <br>  One more thing, you need to imagine how you would feel about this guy if tommorrow he suddenly went broke. How would you feel about him?<br>  <br>  You need to make sure that he is the one making you happy and not the thought of his money. You need to make sure that if someday you were to marry him that you would be willing to stay if he suddenly became broke.<br>  <br>  This happens to well off people all the time.<br>  <br>  Anyway I wish you the best of luck in your realtionship. I hope things go well for you. Drop us a line sometime when you find out what this guy and you are all about.|`|08b72b5c6a299d56fed198fbe066f5dcaa	He sounds like a jerk...DUMP him. You don't need someone who does not appreciates you and takes advanatge of you..good luck!|`|12f208a22910f50c3726837af708cef4aa	It is just sex for him. If he cared, he'd be taking you out places. Him having your wine for you and cooking for you is just a way for him to keep you happy enough to keep sleeping with him.|`|1e22d288c4e3f60a3191e253857d099caa	When it comes to men, who really knows!  However, he asks you over, COOKS for you, and has your favorite bottle of wine ready for you?  I'd say this guy is hooked.  You could look at it this way, a way to a man's heart is food.  A way to a woman's heart is romance.  This guy is trying both of these theories, he's creating a food that will (hopefully) make you feel as if it would make him feel if you were to do the same.  And, he's being romantic by creating a scene of intimacy with your favorite wine.  I think he's in to you.<br>  <br>  But, you might want to ask yourself that question as well, do you really like him . . . or is this atttraction soley based on money?  The first thing you mentioned to explain how great he is was his house.  Then you refer to it again by saying that he never helps you financially.  Figure out if it's true for you too.  And if it is and gas is a problem, let him know!  Next time he asks you to come over, tell him you're going broke on gas, and ask him to come over.|`|4d8f1e3ad549034348f39ccf1bf36152aa	he only likes you|`|AA11223356	your attraction is based on all about sex and if i were you i would tell him if he don't come then he aint seeing you then thats the way it goes and see if he does like you r not or just ask him|`|AA11860918	this has partly happened to me and take it from someone that know he doesnt love u just wanted u for the sex trust me i know it will be hard but rescue yourself or u will end up to be a sex toy and i dont think u or anyone wants that|`|ae514603ebdd1aff2c31b4ce5b1f6999aa	its hard to tell. most of the time though a guy wouldn't do that just for sex. i mean part of it may be because it may just be that good. but if he's cooking and getting your favorite wine and everything then i likes u. jsut try to get him to come to your place more so that its 50/50 and not u going there only. i mean from me, i'm engaged and me and my fiancee have been having sex for quite some time but i still do everything for her i can. and yes i would say i'm addicted to the sex just because...1) shes my first and only...2) it is great...3) we're going to get married so its not like the relationship is only about sex. u have to put the foot down and make sure he does care about u for yourself. good luck.|`|bf6c7fb946c774db4a65aceaca6afd8caa	It's a sex thing. I think you know that. Nothing wrong with the truth. Think about it, he won't do much outside sex. He should be willing to do anything for you. Wanna test him...??? Stop sleeping with him and watch the TRUE him come out. Bet he'll leave you alone...Sad to say but I've been hurt and I know what that's like. Don't get played sweetie. You (nobody for that matter) deserves that. He probably figures that since he's got it going on and most women are attracted to that, that he can get what he wants. You already said, he won't BUY you dinner but he'll cook. No gas money...??? Listen to that statement. There is something wrong...Put him to the test. Stop sleeping with him and I'll betcha he won't want nothing to do with you. Instant attitude...!!! Good luck...  : )|`|dda7c30202674388f4ddcdad2ca33ecbaa	Sex always complicates a situation!  Why doesn't he come to see you? Why don't you tell him you would love to see him but if you are honestly in need of help with gas money, tell him that!  Might I also mention that he has the "Phat crib" and best wine because he worked for and earned what he has and it isn't his responsibility to take care of you.  If you want him to take you out, then tell him but be prepared to take him out too.|`|df5e3daad50fc9f139bf5d277ed91156aa	it sounds like sex to me|`|c86cf3d1884d05ac95aee7198929f6dbaa	Your attraction is based on money and his on sex...|`|34f018994782f51ef0aa0e23eb7b4988aa	He would rather spend his money on a girl thats worth it...not just a skank he can bang at will.|`|1462179aea8a9209a509bc742eb8eb8baa	it seems like he is only interested in sex. you two need to discuss whether that is all the relationship is going to be. the very least he could do is give you gas money if you are coming to see him and he lives an hour away. that tells you that he doesn't really care about you at all. he has a big gorgeous house, he can afford to put gas in your tank.|`|AA11162641	It sounds to me like this is a physical attraction that has a tremendous potential. To offer you money for gas is crude. He is showing his appreciation in so many ways but he has not yet decided you are worthy of being presented in public to his friends. Do not get greedy over the petty stuff and see if there is a real future with a lot of promise in the future. Don't settle for gas money when the entire oil field is at stake.|`|AA11599430	all he wants is sex from you, dump him, now before you end up hurt|`|AA11820856	I think he yearns for what you have between  your legs.  I wouldn't make any future plans on this relationship|`|4fc044b09c745ecda9ac330867e5cde1aa	From the information that you gave, I have to say that this is just based on sex.  It's not about him not giving you money, because I wouldn't give you any either-he just met you.  If you can't afford to go to this guys house then tell him to come to yours-which is what I would expect him to do since gas is so high.  I say that it's based on sex, because from what you say, he just wants to see you in his house and doesn't want anyone else to see you with him.  If the relationship is fine the way that it is, I say go with it.  If you want more from him, you better have a conversation with him about what you are to each other.|`|6d7595d005ff554d57b45029a32019acaa	well, you seem to have the answer right in front of you..|`|AA10979742	it may be a little of both. Talk to him about that, tell him you can't go over every night and that gas is expensive to drive an hour every day. Be honest, if he doesn't care about you having to drive an hour, or how much gas costs, then he's not worth it dump him find a more considerate guy, who's closer to home.|`|b59164b71a66333f9aaa68502b0fd810aa	I think that he uses you for sex. Since he never takes you anywhere, and never offers to pick you up or give you gas money, it sounds like he knows that you will be over to his house no matter what he does or doesn't do for you. You are just his booty call. Especially seeing that he has good money and doesn't contribute....dump him! don't let him keep playing you for a fool.|`|bb9b8e24673718e46b34f4591e394c50aa	if he won't help you out to go and see him, maybe it is just the sex|`|d22c4a37634fdcfc89fc8c5eaff4468faa	wait a minute .. he cooks for you and has your Favorite wine waiting. And you are whining about going outto eat ? WTF is wrogn with you?<br>  You want him ot pay you for gas ? Do you always expect money after sex ? Cuz that is what you are making this sound like ! <br>  He is pampering you and you are whining about money.You first statement shows how you think Hhe has a PHAT CRIB  - we call that GOLD DIGGING  - he worked for his home and everything he got , why should he just give it to you ?

I was the ex who was still around secretly.<br>  <br>  I ended up getting back together with her, too, because eventually she realised a few things...<br>  <br>  But anyway, I digress a bit.<br>  <br>  Choose the one who brings you peace, the one who makes you calm, the one who is your first and last thought every day. If you think of names, who's name comes to your lips first? If you crave a kiss, who's lips do you think of? If you smile secretly to yourself when nobody is looking, who's eyes are you gazing into in your mind's eye?<br>  <br>  I think you already know who you want, you're just afraid that you'll make the wrong choice.|`|jqKf5QgBaa	Have fun and decide in time.

People, like myself will tend to get lost, and not understand anything you are asking, and then wont be able to help you out. And give people fake names or even a number.<br>  <br>  From what I'm understanding your first love... who is your boyfriend now???... seems to just be a good friend. Sex might be good and all, but just not a relationship. And this second guy that your talking about.... I saw no reason why you WOULDN'T want to be with him. You had nothing bad to say about him. Love is ALWAYS a risk, when your not sure... hell even if you are sure. So go for something new... you never know what might happen. You might end up spending the rest of your life together.|`|AA10762620	"my bf does not know i talk to my ex"-well in relationships-you should be honest.

AA11886852	You can try, who knows, you might gain him. Just a matter of time. Be patient..<br>  <br>  Love is a lasting forever thing. So take your time. and no rush. Boys look at 2 things, prettiness and good personality. You know what pretty is. Good personality is the way u act and speak and how u behave yourself, also how u conduct yourself. They often look for good qualities. This is quite a tough area to improve. In other words, if they like u, means they really like u. If not, then maybe there's still a chance u can improve. All the best to u.|`|AA11820856	Well I guess you could wait and see if it works out between them and if it doesn't you could be there to pick up the pieces.  Or you can go and find the man of your dreams which I am sure is out there if you just look.

cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	It sounds like he likes you to me. Next time he asks for paper or anything else, start up a conversation. Ask him whats up, and how his weekend or game went. If he talks and looks interested, tell him that the two of you should hang out sometime after a game. Most likely he will say yes. Don't be so hard on yourself. Everybody is good looking in their own way. You are just hot and nice :) Two things I'm sure he admires about you :)<br>  Good luck sweetie :)
mJmG3i4Oaa	I totally agree with you. Having a job, people are suppose to handle things right.From reading your question, I noticed theres alot of attention put on you, and they really want you there. bUT THEy don't sound very perfessional, and honest with everyone there. Myabe I'm worng, but if I'm not, then okay. I was also thinking, u should keep the job not only for the money, but becuase u know your not doing anything else. it doesn't seem like your being put in a certain position becuase you've done something wrong,that you didn't really do. I wouldn't focus on what other peoples reconition is, I'll just worry about myself. If I feel that I'm being respected, and getting paid reasonable money, then I'm fine. i HAVE to work in a nice environment. For an example I use to volunteer to help out at an over night camp when I was 13, I did alot of volunteering till today.now i'M 18 AND I'm working at Home depo ( furniture, household items), and I work with people so well, and I get paid good money. Its not all that, but its cool.<br>  <br>  I really don't feel like the comapany people there are not fair at all, it makes no sense. If you don't feel comfortable, then quit, and find a better job thats fair. U know what I'm saying? Well, bye!! Have a nice day.|`|9e52f062bf1eb6e495b3be0bc01878e6aa	I think you are being treated unfairly stick it out the 1/2 months and if you dont get hired permently or if you dont like what your given then QUIT!|`|v2WBXLklaa	this is a tricky one you could leave and then never know how it was gonna go or just stay and ride it ou.<br>  <br>  I say if you can handle it stay then if they mess you about at the end just say<br>  <br>  ' well at least i showed commitment and respect when you's didnt'

775779aba0a5434aa588ba329816b92baa	sounds like he is trying to slowly pull out of the relationship. Two cases happened to two acquintances of mine. The one who wants to end a relationship would tend to have that kind of a plan. So that it won't hurt too much, or, they find it hard to voice out those painful words. So... you can say that they are selfish bec they try their best to turn or create a situation wherein the other party would by force, have to voice out the problem and perhaps create an argument and they will use the chance to break it off. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is to observe very carefully and think carefully about the changes the occurs recently. <br>  <br>  You are the one who has the first hand experience with him and should know the answers/reasons better than anyone else.|`|345bfa853a27c311685e036865816d2daa	look if it was ment to be then it would be going a lot better towards marriagei would just cut your loses and just better luck next time|`|AA12134055	just let it be, and whatever happens, happens...

a25d4d99d6e0fdd6987d0ccdabc95753aa	Get some friends together over at your house to hang out... invite her... not too many, becuse then you may not get to spend much time with her, but enough so that it looks like you were genuinely having a small get together...

mJmG3i4Oaa	Tell your sister to explain to her friends how they should act more mature, and stop fooling around. not rudly, but just let your sister's friend no that being loud and crazy outside in public is immature and not lady like. I don't know if there girls or boys but its not cool. If your the older sis or bro you could talk to them too. Or talk to their parents about their behavior.

gEPosOuyaa	you dont have your age down, but using the game programmer/graphic design info i'd guess you are 35 or under. the college thing is kinda a throw off but hey, im 24 and still in junior college so thats no real judge of age.<br>  <br>  physically, im assuming you have blonde hair and are caucasian based on your avatar.<br>  <br>  as far as your interests and hobbies go im not sure any of those give insight to you physical appearance. there are many stunningly attractive people who dont do drugs and are not wreckless and have a love for all things technical.<br>  <br>  my guess is that you are close to the boy next door, maybe not super physically fit but not blobby. do you wear glasses, maybe contacts even? id guess, according to your technical tendancies and interest in psychology that you are fairly intellegent, grades do reflect accurate intellegence, more like a reflection of drive and life happenings current to the times. also the organized crime interest leads me to believe that you are probably multi-faceted and again, intellegent, since organized crime, when looked at closely, is a complex system of social hierarchy and self-regualtion among the masses. not very many stupid men rose threw the ranks of any major crime family. id say that you have a calculating mentality, whether for good or bad, and have a natural ability to manipulate people and/or adapt to others.<br>  <br>  but hey... if im wrong, im wrong. i tried.|`|8GyDO8zMaa	A little on the short-side, light brown hair, brown eyes, wears contacts...idk.|`|JBbRS8yfaa	Hmm.

Promise to make him dinner, or massage. Something that shows him affection.<br>  I'm sure it will be good.

You need to figure out what upsets you and find a way to deal with it...go for a walk, call a friend...anything to stop you from eating. They say it takes 21 times to make something a habit,so after 3 weeks of avoiding foods you will be on your way. You could also join curves, it is a great group for women who want to lose weight, plus you will make Friends.

W35fIvP5aa	Nothing, friendship is a great thing. Life isn't all about dating. You could easily find another boyfriend if that's what you want.|`|551WmRqPaa	nothing wrong with you babe.<br>  <br>  let me guess, you already had sex?|`|AA10520412	No offense but he might see you for what you appeared to be.  You had a boyfriend and went out with him at the same time.  He probably thought you'd do it to him so he dumped you first.  What goes around, comes around.|`|bNdMR66Paa	Well the only way to find that out is to ask him.  Dont be afriad to tell him how you are feeling.  Has anything been said to him about you? Maybe the ex is jealous and said somethings to start trouble!  Be honest and let him know that he has hurt you and hasnt given you a real reason for him.  Tell him atleast he can be honest with you about his decision.|`|hCQPTl9oaa	doesn't sound like there is anything wrong with you, he has a loose nut in his brain or something and just doesn't understand. Or on the underside, he could have met someone else....|`|sjlQj4ihaa	1) He's being stupid and doesn't realize what a wonderful peron you are.<br>  2) Nothings wrong with you (see above)|`|eX3jZ3SOaa	I think you when you started dating with other guy you were fully depressed and at that time we need to keep ourselves diverted from the situation. But the problem is we will share our problems with others which they may exploit. So be careful at the difficult times. Dont give too much importance to anyone in your life....|`|jc1aXXbXaa	he probably jus wanted to sleep with u and thats why girls shouldnt make it so easy so jus let go and get on with life|`|sN7LWNSraa	he probably found someone that he wants to try things out with, if they don't work out he'll probably come back to you.
AA11598063	In your best interest, you should remove yourself from the relationship. She keeps talking about you behind your back and she should be woman enough to say what she has to say in your face. The fact that she is trying to get another co-worker involved shows how really childish she is handling the situation. You did whatever you could to try and make peace with this girl and she refuses to make peace with you. If the situation gets out of hand, talk to your supervisor about it or look for another job. Keep in mind that she will get what's coming to her because what goes around, comes around and she shouldn't be talking about anybody behind their backs. Hope this helps and good luck.|`|ffdcbc045d3ab3ad425ae16c233664cbaa	my cousin is the same........she acts stupid and thinks she's perfect..don't bother with them.....send them to trash were they belong<br>  stop talking to them, and do the same to her, ignore her|`|kXzcRE3maa	well you are being the adult in the relationship! i think that you should call it quits because what kind of friend is she to be talking behing your back or you should do what you think is right!
BF9hmUZeaa	there is a verse in the bible that says (not sure where its at right now) what it is saying is that if the wife has faith and the husband doesnt, God will help the husband to have faith.  My husband and I are christians but sometimes I feel like he slips so bad that all I can do is pray about it and have faith that God will bring him back.  Its hard to live with two people of different believes, try to be strong, have faith in the lord and pray for your boyfriend!|`|6af6838c699f0707f4e6433d38520dcbaa	I know that you love him but you must leave him.

I put up with a lot, too. I was in a relationship for 9 years and held fast to my beliefs. He would question me on them all the time. 'Why do you choose to believe in Fairy Tales?' I would tell him that I know what I know and nothing is going to change that. <br>  The worst part about this situation is that you are right there, you aren't being taken seriously and you need to feel validated. He isn't going to give you that because he needs his validation, also. You may never agree on this, ever. You may not be the one to convert him, either. You are too close to the situation. All you can do is pray that he will have a change of heart. After all, God's love can soften the hardest heart so faith can grow.|`|38f79629376831b1971d34e252245276aa	marriage and committment means sticking with someone through thick and thin.  he may come back to believing, he may not... the questions is, could you handle a lifetime of worry and possibly dissagreement about this (as it clearly worries you)?  or will you be able to love him and have a great marriage no matter what he believes?<br>  <br>  i would think through this realistically before you committ to anything more with him.  better to go through this now than later.|`|000a9bf2a83f331bd75569db75909651aa	I don't know where you live but can I recommend a group to you who could possibly help you deal thorough a variety of issues?

Atheist are people who thinks for themself, unlike christian who needs crutches, your boyfriend is obviously an independent free thinker, whereis you are still a scared little coward, i think he should break up with you, afterall who wants to live with a boring christian<br>  <br>  even after you got married, you will divorce, he will not change, once an atheist its pretty hard to change, you two are destined to go seperate way, i hope you find a devout christian guy next time.  btw how come you live together before marriage, that's called 'fornication' according to your religion?|`|C6bRtGijaa	I know that you say that you love him, and you have been seeing him for 4 years.  What happens when you get married?  Things aren't going to get any better.  Work your issues out before then.  Think about if you want children.  How would you want to raise them?  Christian or atheist?  Just something to think about.|`|mVlA3u3zaa	Well. he was an atheist when you met him, you accepted him.. Why can't you accept him now? Why did he change his mind to be an atheist agaian anyway? I think belief is one of the basic human rights.

The payment was real.  It has to be.  Otherwise it is not a payment at all.  The suffering was real.  The separation from His Father was also real.  It was so real that the agony caused his sweat to turn to blood.  The only part of God he could bring to the table was that he was 'sin free' even for a mature adult man.

He loved us even though we didn't love him.  <br>  <br>  He was a great man even though he didn't do those things, they aren't what makes a man anyway, if  you believe that then you need to re-examine your faith!<br>  <br>  God BLess!|`|b1446ed74fe0c4720f8781da91d39adbaa	yeah he did, read the da vinci code, he was banging mary magdeline|`|szbQ2AVcaa	come on dude, you know jesus used that whole "son of God" gimmick to get with the ladies|`|LykjWv6faa	Well, for one.

Oh, and by the way, real men don't look for sex all the time..they're called manwhores..|`|AA10202395	What is a "real" man anyway???!!!! There is no such thing! What makes him a man is because he has a penis! DUH! Are you a "real" man, or just somone looking for a booty call? If that's the case, go out and find  a prostitute. It does not matter that he didn't have sex, a lot of men out there haven't had sex either because they choose not to, or they feel they are not ready. GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE LITTLE BOY

LRTGa4RLaa	Kick her in the face and tell her to F off.|`|JX69BRxbaa	Don't encourage her by actually caring.  Move on and don't worry about her.|`|9abca06f42713e14245ff75961fdaec4aa	Find something else to worry about. She will get over it.|`|AA12147319	tell her that being one of my best friends makes you respect my opinions like not wanting to go to the concert<br>  <br>  and say<br>  <br>  if you want to give an end to our friendship just because of a concert matter ,  it is better you ll never ever be my friend again , i should have crossed you out of my friendship list ...|`|cKjrP6HIaa	She is not your friend, she is just a Control Freak, using you to make herself happy even if you are not, she has no respect for your opinion and feelings. Stop talking to that kind of person.<br>  <br>  Real friends don't try to force you to do stuff you don't like.<br>  <br>  You are no-body's puppet or toy.<br>  <br>  I have a simple rule for friends : "No respet; No friendship. That's it."
4e5c6f9015d687ac5a160a18dfc42d29aa	You shouldnt treat him the same because then he wouldnt realize you like him! If you want him to know that you like him over the other guys then do something for him that you wouldnt do for the others. For instance, invite him over so you two can watch a movie or get a really fun gift for his bday. Maybe he doesnt act like he likes you because you are always surrounded by other guys and he figures you are crushin' on one of them.|`|e7e3a4238cb028d1871039a27332b65aaa	No, if you treat him like a guy friend you will be stuck in the friendship zone. He may not have showed an interest in you because he is shy when it comes to intimacy or some other reason you are unaware of. It is possible that he just does not feel that way towards you.  You need to let him know how you feel. You should take him out, just the two of you and spill out your guts.  I know its scary but if you really want a relationship with him then your going to have to tell him. Warning you may lose your friendship over this so you are going to have to ask yourself are you willing to take that risk? Its all up to you and how you feel about him.  <br>  A good friend of mine never told her guy friend how she felt and he ended up with her best friend. I really think they would of ended up together if she would of told him how she felt.|`|7fd22913e88e02195de2461dd9b32f44aa	write ur crush a letter to let him know how you feel towards him and dont date someone u dont like that way cuz it aint gonna change.|`|AA10145166	yeqa why not just treat them the same.
b6Z746Sbaa	Throw a party and once everybody is invited and coming you can invite her too. It's an easy way to get her to come and it isn't like it's a date :)|`|5uEAHEQJaa	Do something more personal, just you and her.  A lunch sounds nice and not threatening.  I like the lunch, becuase you can talk to each other and not be distracted.  I can remember being asked on a first date to go to a movie.  My date wanted to talk through the movie, that was son annoying, it was a really great movie, I wanted to see the movie.  It made the date very awkward and of course the first date turned into the last.  Byt at lunch, you can relly focus on each other to see if there are any connections.|`|GhPQf4mGaa	i would say invite her to an informal get together with some friends like a bbq or something like that see how it goes and take it from there. good luck|`|Zfrm23wjaa	I would ask her to go somewhere with you with a few other people there. If she enjoys that, then just ask her to go somewhere not too romantic for just the two of you. See how that goes.|`|bd12d29bcc359058ef9444bd356022c1aa	Well, she knows that you exist so you are halfway there. Just ask her out for lunch or dinner so you can talk further. If you like what you hear then you can be more open about your feelings and ask her out again on a more serious level. It should be OK. Good luck|`|mrrnva7caa	Yes, since she has given a feedback of the recent event (indirectly in looking forward to more in future), then u shud go to the next step - plan for more interesting such gettogethers. Find out what she is interested in and line it up accordingly - if she is sporty, then do all those sporting events or is of movie type - do all those movies, popcorns, icecreams, etc. After a couple of those u might get to know each other better and then take the next step accordingly. Good luck ! And hei, have fun on the way !
727e469d9ab03f49b27c3b50501e7e50aa	Don't play a email April fools on her.  It could backfire big time.  If you have to do it, do it over something that is neutral like a ridiculous story about how the Tooth Fairy has been arrested by the IRS for not releasing her records of all the distributions she has made for teeth over the years.
2A7CBIo3aa	Except for Filipinas in Manila area or those in Metropolitan City.Filipinas stay true or loyal to their lovers.They don't break up with their husbands just for sex problems.I mean,lets accept it.Most of American women drop their husbands for the size and performance of their manhood.Well Filipinas.I'm talking bout the typical here.Are quite sweet,caring,thoughtful to therir husbands.Not to mention their not that materialistic.I hope that sheds light.I also wanna ask why women in Europe or America does not dig Asian men?|`|7HiPJOGhaa	I actually find them to be sorta of exotic or erotic, you know, kind of like a girl who emulates a sex goddess. I don't know if that makes any sense.|`|T7kus7OMaa	why? are you a filipina? i think it is the looks.. i dont know but opposites attract each other..|`|t8tY2pwHaa	filipinas are happy, resilient people. not easy to trick but easy to be around. a lot of them here are really smart and have deeply grounded morals. Also, sadly, because of the poverty here, a lot are driven into prostitution and that can be another thing. <br>  <br>  But generally they're great, I live here so I should know!=)|`|L71AiSRSaa	The truth is most of them are gold diggers and they marry just anyone to get them out of their dirty poor country..|`|1fbdc9e19f6eaa35cb1b9ca4cf5563c4aa	i hate there head's shape! i hate the way they pretend crying....i hate many things in them(i think you're one of them)|`|b66e7983570d624d142f0be8483a5ddfaa	UM not sure all of that, but as an american I can tell you that we all have different taste, but everybody likes things that exotic, and different. Alot of us like women from other countrys because we don't like the crappy way amercian women treat us.

He was pretty honest at you on this so you shouldn't feel bad because he's talking to someone....now he is checking his options and this other girl could be one. Don't feel bad about it, just keep going to get him and do not talk about the other girl with him or you will seem jealous or desperate and men don't like this.<br>  Don't feel bad, he just wants to check his option but it does not mean you lost ok?|`|Ee7muctuaa	Queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee?????????|`|5d0d1deb7a6df13437b260efc537b2afaa	First of all, u cant make somebody likes you, that just happen being yourself. Anyway, I understant u feel betrayed, cause he havent told you bout the other girl, i ve been there! But believe me, the best you can do to feel better is 1: ask him very casually who is she? and 2: look for someone else to talk too, can make u feel less pressure bout him!<br>  Anyway i wish you good luck!!

8dQGSUpvaa	By you pointing out all of those details, it sounds like you already know he likes you.  Are you looking for confirmation from us or are you simply waiting for him to just walk up  to you, put his arm around your waist, pull you close to him and kiss you...real nice and real long.<br>  If you like him back to be more than friends, just ask him if he likes you more than a friend.  If he appears to be shy at that point, but you feel he will say yes, then you jump in and say, well, I like you too, and give him a really nice kiss.  The rest will come naturally.|`|2ZuKeEG8aa	Have you tried asking him or would that just be too easy?|`|eec1c26911b3820fb5e5edd1276d26d9aa	He might as well tattoo it to his forehead that he likes you.

The only way someone will truly "fall in love" with you is if you show them the kind of attention that they need and let them know how you really feel.<br>  <br>  Third, you can also get some fake love by buying them presents and doing whatever they say. Either that or let them have their way with you.

P.SS i'm from cape - town in south africa|`|9a09376e5cf5f865f7d915b6a0d0b3beaa	Theyre insecure|`|d5894a3a3edd7f3e7f621016d1942cc4aa	It is their ego's.  They are too Macho too show their emotions.

Others can't show emotion because of issues they wish not to discuss, or simply don't know how to express their emotions without feeling like they are stupid for doing such.|`|AA11555370	Mr. Chivalry says, "They can, but society has said that men who show emotion are weak.

The Family Service Center on base offers free counseling for both of you. Also the Center will have knowledge of other resources for you such as child care, budget help and Spouse Support groups. You have to reach out to these areas even if you think its not "cool".  They are used to these issues and see them all the time.  You are both young and inexperienced in how to be in a relationship and you are both under pressure. I urge you to put your feelings aside and seek help.<br>   Alcohol problems never LOOK like alcohol problems when they start.

That way he has to stay home with your baby and you get to make new friends at work and make your own money at the same time. After you make your friends & make your money, I'm sure your husband will stop his ways. If not, do the same thing to him so he can see how it feels. He will either learn that what he is doing is wrong or he will get worse...if he gets worse, it's time to make an ultamadium..good luck|`|146a469bbadae68fd85ad72201e2837eaa	Well what do you THINK he's doing?

You are the mother of his child, his wife, he seems to have no respect or concern for your happiness.  Tell him you both must go to counseling or you are considering leaving and going somewhere else where people care about you and your child.  He needs to grow up.  He is a married man with a child. I am all for marriage working if it doesn't involve abuse by a drunk.  He is taking you for granted.  Bring this to his attention without getting mad, he will respond better if he doesn't feel threatened. Good luck to you.  Find a good church where you can talk to other people and let them help you too.|`|aa80a7f0e4a99ebab3eb4f12cca84a96aa	put the shoe on the other foot! if you cant get money from him go visit friends from your hometown while viviting your family, let him go through a little of the same thing . you dont have to go to bars but he doesnt have to know this . your a woman use that power god gave you, theres nothing more stronger|`|b7867d065ad68ff4c1dfa3f6b8de9da6aa	He obviously isn't interested in your well being or in being a good father or role model.  Plus, he's a marine...and you're probably pretty young.  Assuming he's young too, the behavior probably won't stop any time soon.  Unfortunately, what you will probably find, is that we moms have to sacrifice because, and NOT in all cases, men are not willing.  Your love for your child will override your frustration toward his selfish behavior.  Since your baby is only 10 months old, and not a wild toddler yet, you can do your best to read books or keep a journal and get yourself distracted.  If you can, maybe go to a book store, park, coffee shop or anywhere to find a new friend.  Maybe your husband could even hook you up with resources from his base on other military wives in the area.  I know you're lonesome, but if he's out getting drunk that's better than out with other women.  He also might be releasing stress with guys that understand why he is so stressed.  It might be like you trying to help him understand the pain of childbirth...it's just not possible.

AA11292734	Then that relationship is built on mere fantasy - just as simple as that.|`|AA11820856	It means the phone is great and you need to find someone else to be with in person|`|767a926c494a4f5baedbc321dff9febcaa	Means you have a better time on the phone or net with this person... see it for what its worth a mere fling...move on to a REAL relationship with a in the flesh person.|`|057c0e03b51d26e590969351c5835f34aa	When you talk on the phone, you miss things like body language, posture and facial expression.  Instead, you are forced to rely on words spoken and voice tone.  Words can easily be manipulated into what you want to hear, but body language does not lie.  Every situation is different.   I would be inclined to think that when you are together you are picking up on each other's body language and it is telling you that you just don't click.  If there are things about each other that really annoy you, both his and your body language will show it.<br>      I think if you pay attention next time you are together, you will see that while in conversation he tends to lean away from you or looks away while you talk or maybe crosses his arms.  These all indicate that he is not comfortable with you.  You may even find that you are the one leaning away and realize that maybe this is just not the relationship you are really looking for.  In any event, body language will triumph.  Even if you are currently unaware that deep down inside you really don't want to be together, but think that you do want to be together, you are not going to be able to force it to work.  <br>      It feels good to be in a relationship.  It makes you feel wanted and accepted. Sometimes that can make you more tolerant of things you know that you do not want.  I suggest this.  Take a piece of paper and divide it into two columns.  In one column, write down everything you really like about him.  In the other column write down everything you do not like.  Then go through both columns and decide if you think it is realistic to expect each item to either remain the same or more realistic to expect it to change.  When you are done you should have a pretty accurate list of your likes and dislikes about the relationship.  Then you have to weigh it out and decide if it is something you can and are willing to live with.  Sounds like you have some thinking to do.<br>     Good luck|`|5469fc8cad13ff860f743d5536077994aa	If you can't have a good relationship in person, then it's not a relationship.
2ce1581cfccccc196c61ac5d953af093aa	couple of ways you can know if someone is interesting in you and want to have conversations with you.<br>  1. They will call you back, providing that you give a return contact email or number.<br>  2. They will ask you questions of your self.<br>  3. They will in some point want to meet you and possibly want to start a simple friendship dating.<br>  4.

What your friend says is just an excuse.  There's nothing wrong with liking people of different races.  You don't have to have an explanation for it.

Most women don't like a show off but they do like a man to have confidence and some kind of a back bone. Confidence is something that you have to have within yourself. Therefore you have to look within yourself and find the one thing that you do like about yourself and let it be your inspiration to gain more confidence. If women are feeling you that should be inspiration right there. You're not ugly so don't allow your nervous to get the best of you when talking to a girl. Just be yourself and say what's in your heart to say. Women like men that can be themselves around them you don't have to put on a show. You will find women that are going to like who you are as a person and you will find some that may not. But in the end just be happy that you are a living and just love yourself and who you are more and more each day. Then others can love you as well. Good Luck!!!!!|`|c7dc8d3d29ca81cb8abad5dc040e4b75aa	I don't like loud, obnoxious show off guys. But I like guys with self esteem and self confidence. You should start by just accepting yourself and loving yourself. Corny as it sounds, you can't love another person until you love yourself. Find things and qualities that are great about you and center on them. I am sure you have something great and unique about you. Use that as your confidence. Look a girl in the eye, stand up straight and smile. Making the first move also shows confidence. You just have to not let turn-downs get to you and just know you have nothing to lose. If a girl shoots you down, move on. No loss.

Dont listen to those who say if ur single be afraid, be very afraid, NOT TRUE!!! There are many woman who are SOO scared to be alone they endure horrible relationships with people just to feel like their life is "VALID".  The true test of life, and true LOVE is loving urself enough to say" I'm ok being single, and thats when god may bless u with a companion, or not. Just love urself.  Look at the nuns, they have long lives, and I know MANY older ladies whos husbands died decades ago, and they are JUST fine, even better.  Its nothing wrong with standing on ur own. <br>  The first responder told u single people die early, blah, blah, I think the miserable people that he is talking about, are any people with stressful, dishonest, chaotic lives.

AA11820856	Well first off you file the paper work and they are going to want pictures of you two together (recent ones) which means you are going to have to go there and see her.  It is going to be a little pricey since there is some corruption in the philippines.  You can file some of the paper work here right off the net and the rest she is going to have to do there and if you go and see her go with her so that they wont be so liable to screw her financially if your there with her.  It takes some time but it is worth it.  I have had many friends that have done it and I wouldn't mind doing it but don't have the time right now nor do I have a girl friend lol.  But I have quite abit of knowledge with the immigration department and that is what your going to have to do.  And make sure she knows alot about you because they will ask her about you.  They want to make sure she isn't just getting a fixed marriage to come to the states for prostitution which is running rampant these days|`|95176bb719c104fed1b17f779276ab1caa	marry right now then she's pretty much a usa citizen|`|544b2680a30db2de782d078a5a74d992aa	Why can't u visit you??? or send her money. help her look for a job to get the money to see u.|`|b65a7f771c513333f8c6a2562f1ce748aa	Oi, Kabayan! had the same problem but gave up. you know what, why don't you ask for the help of that Gurfinkel guy on TFC? but if you hate his guts like i do, well, it's easier to petition someone if you're not a citizen yet because there was a lag and citizen petitions are being processed on 1994. sorry dude can't be more of help.|`|ebfbcdc39b509666ac0776a42e278121aa	If she's willing to go to you alone.. simply contact your embassy, help her get the visa... it is faster when someone is helping from the USA as well as other travel documents..<br>  <br>  You can send her the money for alll the expenses required of it<br>  <br>  Is the girl liberal?  Otherwise you may have a problem with family and relatives lateron.. Ask her first..

If she doesn't respond well, you can blow it off and say something about how you always kiss your female friends goodbye and that you weren't trying to make her feel uncomfortable.|`|2e7a46826a665cbeab4f91e029d48d9faa	come clean man,tell her how u feel.u seem 2 have a fear of rejection.Just have this in mind,being turned down doesnt make u a lesser person ,best of luck|`|9bfd38c4f34e4912768a91622fc57a55aa	tell her|`|AA10100609	ok|`|AA11830110	Just keep going out with her, maybe she likes you too, and is thinking the same thing.

I am considered a loner too because i don't like other people to know too much about me. <br>  If you really want to have barkada, you have to start to open yourself to others. Don't just wait for people to approach you. You approach them first. Then, be more sporty. Try to participate in conversations, events and things like that. <br>  You cannot force people to become your barkada. You just have to let it happen naturally and it takes time. A long time.

8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa	You don't mention your age or dating experience, but it sounds as though you are young and not very experienced with the dating world.  Lucky you to be just starting out on this part of your life!!<br>  <br>  First, I don't think that you need to worry about choosing one of the guys over the other.  You don't have a "type" at this point and you need to learn how to be friends with all types of people and this includes guys.  This means see as many different guys as possible.  You don't have to choose between them right now.  Enjoy the company of lots of different dating partners.  That's how you learn what you like and with whom you are comfortable.<br>  <br>  Second, keep firmly in mind that friendship must be the first goal in a dating relationship.<br>  <br>  Third, if anyone you are dating trys to sell you on the sexual part of dating before you are ready, they are just plain selfish and are dating only to get sex, not to get to know you.  These are people you should avoid like the plague!!<br>  <br>  Fourth, know your own worth.  You are a unique creation of the good God above.  You are wonderfully made.  Don't sell yourself short.  Don't fall for lines, but go with what is right and makes you feel right.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your dating future and remember to have fun!!  :)|`|AA10554783	Make a choice or tell the guys that you want to date and not get serious about one person.

Ask your husband his feelings on the matter first and then approach your inlaws together with ideas.  <br>  Many women with children work outside the home.  This is nothing novel.|`|e06b29daf0ba378eead1fa2054ead738aa	I think you can continue to work if your inlaws are fine . You can take care of the baby for sometime and then you can work. Baby will grow up within no time and its not nice to lose your job.
bbbb1fd709a3c0ff925df435d0c84cdfaa	Tell them things that are special about them, things that are different about them than other girls.  Tell them that they look nice, smell nice.  Tell them that you feel good being around them and you enjoy talking, and listening to them, and that you like the way they think, and express themselves.  Be honest with them though about these things, so what you are looking for will be more real, and more special, and good.  Don't talk about sexual things until the right time comes, like AFTER it happens.  (or during, to make things better, and even then I would say talking about what's going on, as in sex should wait until AFTER the first time)|`|029818b342e92b26fe2b0e47dcc9625daa	Huh?

cfaad82a8587f42fef1a0bf91dc5a381aa	I was in love with this guy many years ago, but I was young and being in love wasn't the coolest thing to do at the time. He moved away and I started seeing the guy i was seeing before him. We remained in touch but I still had feelings for him, at the 5 year mark of him being gone he offered to send me a plane ticket to come out there but i refused. I  should have went because the guy i ended up with at the time i had two kids by and he is the king of a**holes. I will always feel i missed my opportunity to be with the RIGHT one. He never asked me to come out there again and I spent many years waiting and hoping he would before i gave up. Now we rarely even communicate via email, we never talk over the phone, i NOW realize I will probably never see him again.|`|1882dad790fdfa71d23607e64f1bad83aa	I think most people have done that <br>  I regret not telling the guy I dated before  The Guy I am with now .<br>  He was a great guy but yet I wanted to date more .

f896fb2755e9ba1bf76a0ecfb72d8128aa	The first thing you should do is talk to him about it. There's nothing wrong with him talking to his ex and being friends with her, but he needs to make it very clear that you're the top priority in his life, and the ex is nothing more than a friend. He shouldn't be planning on spending days with his ex, that's for sure. It sure sounds like his ex is trying to get back together with him, and he isn't exactly pushing her away. That's not good, he needs to make a choice and stick with it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't settle things down, talk to his ex. Ask if the relationship is "just friends" or something more - and make it clear that if it's something more, she can have him, because you don't want any part of him if he's cheating on you.|`|0ae78e1d495e90a5c4be9f8d45a8b576aa	Move on, you can get better.

It's never an easy thing. First off don't try to impress her with gifts and words. girls tend to know if a guy is trying too hard. It's critiacal that you be as relaxed and as comfterble with her as possable. And her with you. If you love her then tell her how you feel. But do so gently. If you do it to strongly she will get scared and may reject you. You have to do what you feel is right. Be yourself around her. Make her feel like she's the most special person in your life. I'd recomend dinner. Something that will give you plenty of time to put your heart on the table. Take your time and sense how she feels about what you say.

As long as he is a good father to you and his children and he spends time with them at night when he is home, that is helping you. But if you both work and you are both bringing money into the home and he is not helping you at all, then I would tell him, help, or leave.  Because you have no use for him, because at that point he is just adding weight to your load, and not helping you carry the load. blessed be.......|`|d4152541af11cf62d45cbf26acfd6bb4aa	Ive been there done that just about a month ago.  I hate to say this but it took some yelling to get it done.  I had tried and tried to explain to him that I was burnt out.  I work 40hrs week just like he does but yet it was left up to me to everything else including go pay all the bills and grocery shopping with our 4 and 3 yrs old to lug around becuase he wanted time with friends.  After about of month and talking and the promises that he would step up.  I finally had enough I straight up told him that if he didnt want to give his 100% then I would stop giving mine.  I would leave and there wouldnt be an us anymore.  I told told him that I could do it on my mine own and we he gave the stupid look I told that I was doing it all on my own anyway so what is the point of us even being together I also explained that we he has a problem I cater to it and do what ever needs to be done to fix it.  But when I have a problem its like oh well shes not happy to bad.  I told him I was tired of it and if wanted to continue to keep doing what he was doing which is nothing that I would pack and be gone ASAP. Then I stomped up the stairs without giving him really a chance to say anything.  The next morning he got up with kids and let me sleep.  He cooked breakfast and said if you need time with your friends today go ahead Ill watch them while your gone.  To this day we are good as gold he knows when I cant take anymore and does whatever it takes to help.  GOOD LUCK to you girl.  I know people say talk it out but if your man is a bullheaded as mine which it sounds like he is do what you got to do to get your point across otherwise you still be doing it on your own so you might as well be without him

e44b14ece0efa9cbc96336a8876cd8a7aa	I was raised by strict parents, but not nearly that strict.....I wasn't allowed to date either til 18 and thereupon after that was ONLY allowed to be in my parent's presence with my b/f and that tells you pretty much how life was for me!!<br>  <br>  I'm glad that you're able to identify your feelings about the dating scene and how you feel vs how you've been taught.  I'd suggest to not let all of your raising fall by the way side.  I'm thankful for my strict Christian raising because it helped me to pick out the best man for me and I'm daily living in blessings because of that.  BUT, i don't know your situation other than what you've given and it doesn't sound like you'd necessarily want to go with guys from your church.....<br>  <br>  THere's nothing wrong with not having been kissed yet!!  That's special!!  I was 18 myself before I got my first kiss, and saved my virginity for my wedding night.  While many people would say that's dumb, oldfashioned, or not necessary, I would never do anything differently.  It WAS HARD, but such a fulfilling goal....(and enjoyable fulfillment when reached!! ;))   Respect yourself and don't think you have to kiss a guy just to be kissed...you're special!!  <br>  <br>  your guilty feelings are because of waht you've been taught for so long...don't shove the guilt away, but slowly work through it....logically deciding what you believe and why.  You're an adult and as such you have the right to believe what you will, to make choices and live with the consequences....<br>  <br>  I give you props for going out with an old friend...keep it light and casual for a while!  Also try going out with just acquantances or guys you meet at school/college/work/whatever....  Keep it comfortable and feel your way through the whole dating scene....It will probably take a while but you want to be confident and not rush into anythign you'll later regret....<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|0f2b2d518a2e9ea55416bb8586c8c570aa	I would loooove to know what church that was... anyway, I say go and have a blast, it might seem strange at first but after a while you'll get over it.

The proof is as simple as seeing these like product placement: Their religion is the good one, all others are fakes, and if you don't believe you burn in hell. If this isn't proof that organised religions are but a tool for the power mongers to keep their "sheep" in check through fear and guilt, I don't know what else to say!<br>  <br>  Basically like you said, unfortunatly the damage is done. But you are lucky to have realised the cult's true face (evil indoctrination) and are now concious of yourself and of the damage brought onto you. This, as "G.I.Joe" would say, is "half the battle". Just think of all those poor souls who are still under the clutches of organised religions throughout the world; those who believe you are a sinner for mearly questioning the faith at all!<br>  <br>  Basically your recovery may or may not be as simple as you can imagine it. The mere fact you are concious of the damage enables you to take steps into remedying the damage done, even if the tools required may not be as evident as they could be. <br>  <br>  Your feelings of guilt and fear are quite natural; you are diving into parts unknown and you have been "brainwashed" for years that courtship and such is "evil". You shouldn't let your fear and guilt take over you, but rather you can use these feelings to your advantage, permitting you to be more concious of what others are doing around you, and how you can avoid the trappings and shenanigans of males who prey on innexperienced women in the dating circle. <br>  <br>  Do not feel rushed; like you need to make up for lost time. You should in fact take your time, do what you feel is right, and don't be afraid to mention to your "date(s)" that you want to take it slow, go your own pace. If the guy really cares for you, he will respect your wishes and allow you to take all the time you need. <br>  <br>  Just make sure not to get too drunk on alcohol during those first few dates, as sexual predators lurk within most of us, and the desire to take advantage of a drunk and innexperienced woman is a strong one in most males. <br>  <br>  Remember that you need to go at your own pace, and allow yourself to feel guilt-free in this new dating game. You have all the time in the world to "catch up", so just go with the flow and do what you feel is right for you, and what makes you feel good.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit!|`|b6fd15f89ebfca063617f7de48078c4baa	Church is not a cult, unless they are stupid.<br>  You shouldn't think that church is evil.  Dating is not evil, unless you have s*x and all of that.  You just need to relax, and because you haven't had a boyfriend before, you are getting nervous.<br>  VERY SIMPLE.|`|AA11820856	Well  you already realize the brain washing so let it loose.

4264dc9183b0e7a4ee3023a33e278003aa	It should take more than a week before you really like them in the first place. I would go on dates with several guys and don't be exclusive until one of them stands out. that is what dating is. Just because you go on a date or 10 dates doesn't mean you are an item.  <br>  Try to focus on really getting to know the guy and not how does he fit your requirements. We have a tendency to put up expectation on someone when we first like them, and fool ourselves into thinking they are what we want without ever really getting to know that person. So when we learn who that person is, our image of who they are changes and often we are disapointed.<br>  <br>  But remember, the more requirements you have for a lover the harder they are to find and the harder it will be for you to be happy.|`|450784ff24af0972ead60f95dec88ce9aa	you shouldn't have to make yourself stay interested. if you lose interest oh well.|`|AA11085415	How old are you?

You're just not really interested in a relationship at all, and are just trying to convince yourself you are because everyone else thinks you should be. In this case, I would just drop it and start doing somethign else.<br>  2. You just haven't met the right guy yet. In this case, just go on trying.<br>  3. You either get bored because these guys are too perfect and therefore not a challenge to get, or you get disgusted because they provided a nice fun challenge but then you realize they're losers. In this case, you'll need to accept decent guys as they are rather than always seeking a challenge.|`|AA11820856	Start dating guys that are a challenge and not so easily controlled because that is what is probably boring you.

(AKA--rape)|`|6f7775a42a70e16a8c3c67ba4993bf71aa	Because he thought he would get somewhere with you knowing you were drunk. Just trying to take advantage of you. Maybe secretly he has feelings for you but certainly went the wrong way about it if he does, he showed you no respect,  If he was your best friend he shouldnt be now....|`|4630ac3ee611e4c70e49b30d57b7cec4aa	BECAUSE...even if you look at a man they think you want to screw them...all men...and it is a fact that they look at a woman and automatically imagine how they would be in bed...friends or not!!

8ae4ea8d98eeb6098fee4a221ffbfea8aa	very good idea. Guys that stare needs their lives to be taken away|`|a9e7f7922dcbb3bea1a5db8b0245ef54aa	Some are rude, some are shy, some are in a place where they can admire beauty, but will not approach it because they are not free to do so.|`|AA11491405	Those things stared first!|`|AA11820856	Most guys stare for the obvious but if they stare and you catch them it is because they want you to see them staring at you to let you know they are interested.  If they don't say anything it is usually because they are shy or don't think that they stand a chance of being with you.  Give them a break, it could be worse and they could be giving you sly remarks or making an **** of themselves in public over you.  You are probably hot and get stares alot but be appreciative of it because it might not always be there.  So that is the breaks of being hot :)
0325eb1f9ff1029cc602a19244b8852baa	You just haven't met the right person yet.  Don't worry, your day will come!!!|`|072b0eb01dfcd307d99c862629a743c4aa	Maybe you are too intimidating to men.  I understand how you feel, I am very outspoken and not shy at all.  But when there is someone that I am interested in, I have to calm myself down.  I have turned a lot of guys away because of how outspoken I am.  Just put the charm on and speak really low.  Good luck.  This comes with experience.|`|AA11149006	I bet there are some who really fancy you, the problem is that everyone tries to hide their true feelings, hoping the other person will just guess what is in their heart.|`|0c29d21f3cd51d396f4bf313bb4fe65caa	Don't worry, I used to be in the same boat as you.

No one is ugly physically, everyone is beautiful in their own way. But what can make people ugly is by their personality! Maybe sometimes u come on too strong with a guy so they tend to back off! or maybe u don't need to be so straight forward... look at your personality and see what it is telling u.... guys don't always go for looks (altho it definitely looks and feels like it!)|`|5739c5348cb1b82942ec889d254508cbaa	Regardless of how ugly you are, there is someone out there uglier than you that does have a boyfriend.  Be advised though, if you are ugly you damn sure better be very sweet and not a loud obnoxious know it all chick because guys can't stand them regardless of how attractive they are.|`|7c5354d845467ece1c15893e91999621aa	maybe you are obnoxious?|`|c3dc1a58c412c88503172d45c77354a4aa	if you are shy you have to get over it and get going  you sould try new things you would have a lot of fun ..|`|f26e5cef9a3a0b1ec83d135c6d60971eaa	This doesn't mean you're ugly.  Is it possible that people who like you just haven't said so?  Opposites attract, so it's really possible that the people who do fancy you are shy (since you said you're not).  It's likely that someone does really like you,  but they haven't said anything.  Have you asked anyone out?  <br>  There's a trick you can try that may get you noticed.  Try wearing really bright colors.  (Not all together, you'll look like a clown) If you're wearing neutral pants, go for a bright blue or yellow shirt, or any other bright color - just something to make you stand out. Going into autumn wear a bright colored wind breaker, so people will know it's you even from a distance.  Most species use bright colors to attract mates, and it's really effective on the sub-conscious level.  This really does work, and it's so subtle nobody will ever know you're doing it on purpose.  Good Luck, and don't be hard on yourself.
e2dfd7eb65d0d2120a4565407a8c2ee7aa	Nope, you are not asking for too much :-)<br>  <br>  The first thing you have to do is work on your self esteem. You won't get any attention if you feel like you are ugly or uninteresting. <br>  Dress to flatter your body, don't slouch, stand up tall with your shoulders back. <br>  Look him in the eye when you are talking to him, and smile. It shows that you are interested in him.<br>  Complement him, but don't over do it. Small things like "what a great shirt" can go a long way. He'll know that you notice him, and that you like what you see.<br>  When talking, if he says something funny, don't be afriad to laugh and lightly touch his hand or arm.<br>  Get him talking about himself. The more you know, the more conversation you can have with him. <br>  Open up about yourself, but don't spend hours on end talking about you. The more he knows, the more there is to like about you.<br>  Avoid "closed" body language, like crossing your arms over your chest, scowling, frowning, looking at your feet when you talk, or walking too fast.<br>  Don't immediately go for the sexual comments. They make you appear trampy.<br>  Don't put on any type of act, you will come across as a fake. <br>  Let your intellegence show, but don't over do it. You don't want him to think you are a ditz or a super brain. The first comes across as a bimbo, and the second comes across as intimidating.<br>  When walking away from him, look back over your shoulder and smile at him. It lets him know that you would rather stay than leave, you want to spend more time together.<br>  Avoid any conversation about past relationships. He shouldn't feel like you are comparing him to an ex.<br>  Don't flirt with other guys in front of him, or with his friends. It's a blow to his self esteem.<br>  Don't try to be perky all the time, it comes across as hyper.<br>  Face him when talking to him. You shouldn't be looking over your shoulder.<br>  Don't talk about your problems. He doesn't want to hear about the friend that stabbed you in the back or the unfair things your perents did. If he brings it up first about how something bad happened to him, just nob and say "Yeah, I hate when that happens" or something. <br>  <br>  Most importantly, be yourself. Be postitve and happy but don't try to turn into something you aren't. If he doesn't like you for eho you are, then he's not worth your time.|`|AA11284720	Flirting is so much fun as its all eye contact and little laughs. Go with it and have fun!!!|`|AA11477616	just start talking and ask them how they are,,ask them what kind of things they like to do...and ask them maybe we can get together sometime...and so forth....|`|0b3c6c38f9c53823b593638468a4418caa	Go up to him twirl yer hair<br>  Wear nice clothes <br>  Smile Alot<br>  <br>  <br>  PEac|`|AA12361935	Steps<br>  <br>     1. Approach him and start a conversation, but don't make it too obvious that you like him. If he approaches you, look him in the eyes as a sign of affection and confidence.<br>     2. Try to touch him whenever you can, on his arm or wherever else. Don't make it too obvious.<br>     3. Play with your hair or clothing.<br>     4. Talk sexy around him to get his attention, and lick your lips, but don't change your voice too much. This can be a turn-off. Instead, just sweeten your voice a little, make yourself sound happy.<br>     5. Once you've got his attention, look him in the eyes and smile. If he smiles back, slowly look down, and repeat. Guys like girls who can show off their smile.<br>     6. Don't make it too obvious when he's around his friends, unless you know that he likes you.<br>     7. Laugh with him, and help him to feel comfortable around you.<br>     8. Find a reason to whisper something in his ear.<br>     9. Don't try to be someone you aren't. You attract the kind of person you are. Don't pretend to be a sportsy type when you're really a poet.<br>    10. Talk about what you have in common, and ask questions about what you don't. People love to feel like they're interesting. (And heck, they probably are, too.)<br>    11. Say his name a lot. This shows you're interested in who he is. Give him a nickname, so you two have a little inside joke to share. Most likely, he'll give you one, too! <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips<br>  <br>      * Don't flip your hair too much, instead find a small stray chunk and twist it around your fingers.<br>      * Try not to make it obvious that you are flirting.<br>      * Don't try too hard to impress him.<br>      * Be yourself, and add some flirting to go with it.<br>      * Don't flirt with someone else's boyfriend or husband it only leads to trouble.<br>      * Auto-erotic touching (touch your lips, neck, chest with your fingers or hands) - it is something people do subconsciously when they like you, but you can manipulate it.<br>      * Boss him around or call him names (in a nice way); anything to make him notice you. He won't take offense to the name calling if he likes you!<br>      * Whenever he's around, make sure you're having fun (laughing, etc) so that he'll want to join in.<br>      * Change your tone of voice when you're around him.<br>      * Take a break every now and then to leave him wanting more.<br>      * Massages are always nice.<br>      * Tell him you had a dream about him. If he finds this kinda creepy, then just say it wasnt 'about' you, but you were there!<br>      * Don't apply lipstick, chapstick, or lipgloss in front of him.<br>      * Tell him you'd like to see him again if leaving, or mention that you'd like to try one of his hobbies.<br>      * Listen carefully to what he says, and let him know you were listening through your conversation.<br>      * Remember what he mentions in passing (it's the little things that count!) and bring it up later as a question. For example, he says "I've got to go home, I'm helping my sister study for her exam tomorrow." Later, you ask, "How did your sister (call her by her name if you know it - it shows you can put two and two together!) feel she went in the exam?"<br>      * Do your research. If he mentions that he loves baseball, ask him if he watched the game on the weekend, and know the score or something that happened so you can talk about it. If you don't know much about what he likes (e.g. Baseball), get him to teach you something about it - he will feel knowledgable and important, and it's the perfect excuse to spend time with him!<br>      * Ask to borrow things, or for help with something, but don't be too clingy. Show him that you can handle things for yourself most of the time. This way he will be intrigued by your independence.<br>      * Hint about a movie you'd like to see. <br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings<br>  <br>      * Be careful that he's not leading you on so he can make a fool out of you.<br>      * Don't dress like a slut or skank, instead leave a little to the imagination<br>      * Make sure he doesn't have a girlfriend who will be a snob to you, if she finds out you've been flirting with him. She will have the right to be a snob to you, you're invading her relationship.<br>      * Certain boys can sometimes be very unfair! So be careful if you tell any of his friends!<br>      * Boys act differently around their mates.<br>      * If his friends don't like you but he does you shouldn't let him keep you a secret. this just shows that he isn't proud of his woman and you want someone who wants you for you and doesn't care about what others think. You don't have to rush to say that you're in love or not; so don't trap him.<br>      * Don't pretend to be interested in something just for the sake of flirting - if you decide to make a move, it might mean you end up pretending to be someone you're not. <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Flirt-with-a-Guy" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Flirt-with-a-Guy</a>|`|bc9acfb1cf9f6b57959daf3fe9d79a4caa	always try to maintain eye contact with him,also command sex and seductiveness in whatever u do try as much as possible to show ur true intention but wait for him to make the move.

Seeing someone every day is usually "too much" unless you are at the stage in life where you are looking for a relationship that is going to move onto marriage at some point. <br>  My best advice would be for you to stop asking to see him every day, find some hobbies or other things to do.

Plus if you guys spend every waking moment together, you don't have any new and exciting news to tell each other about what has been going on in your lives. There is no need to be together 24/7, keep it lively and civil. Also it sounds like you are being very selfish........set aside days in the week to have a date night or to cuddle and watch a movie together.
d6d12f5635eb2aa8963c168647b655a1aa	For once, just be bold! When u see him in the crowd again, go up to him and tell him exactly how you feel. This is the only way to find out what could be possible for you two. I used to be this way, and one day I just decided to get bold and tell the guy how i felt. I am so glad I made this decision, because it was 4 years ago and we are still together today!|`|e5364d247b36c73b275e1f1e4f4c07b9aa	you still have a chance|`|AA11820856	If it was ever there and he is still available then that feeling could arise again.  It doesn't normally go away that fast.  If you have the opportunity again I suggest that you put things aside and jump on it right away|`|7a76e0494a5ae222104e58b87625c4f2aa	You know what don't ever give up until he acts the part of a ***!!!!He is probably so into you but thinks your not you are giving him the wrong signs because your shy just think of him as a normal person and speak to him he will never be nasty to you and you know that whatever you are really fearing here its unfounded!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|95ed1965394d6acf8d59bbc9a4237e04aa	you didn't ruin it. he's probably afraid you don't like him ask him out. he'll say yes.|`|AA12091316	No, no, no you haven't blown it.. just relax, go up to him and ask him out.  Explain, lightly, over your coffee or drinks or whatever that you were so flustered and rushed with work the previous times (when he asked you out) that it just wasn't a good time for you.  He'll understand that.  You're probably unsure of your own feelings about him now because you're a bit embarrassed and feeling a bit silly, but that will pass.  Take a deep breath, approach him and ask him out for a coffee.  What have you got to lose?  Good luck...|`|d0a2fecb0d778b8be343c2d88165f307aa	If he still waves and says hi Im sure he still likes you but maybe gets the feeling your not too into him because you have been a little shady. Some how let him know you werent being shady on purpose, just rushing to work. Then ask him out, Im sure he will totally understand and love to go out on a date. You just need to communicate a little better. Dont be so shy and have some confidence girl. Good luck :)|`|0c889d284751e319b16eeecda39989dbaa	how about if u just move on, foget him and get another boy.<br>  <br>  so u won't have to worry bout this question.|`|0ce30ff89a1f3466f8dcea4459dfc86eaa	hey, <br>  all I can say is if it is meant to be, pray about it and God will work it out. Seek first the kingdom of God and all things will be added unto you. That means just do what God wants you to do, and he will fulfill your desires. If your desire is to find love and a companion, God sees that and he knows what your heart longs for, just look to him, he is an Abba  Father(daddy God) he loves you like a daddy and will always be there to help. just ask.<br>   I hope this helped you. good luck|`|0e8dfc499d6e6134b4e3ac02f24ebc62aa	Now it is your turn to cross the crown to let hime know you are interested. Set that coffee date!|`|314092812ee2f93df99495eaf53e0584aa	His ego is most likely bruised he'll get over it, if your shy write down what you did here and give it to him.  Guys like getting notes from girls it makes them feel special.  Don't let you chances get ruined because your scared, step outside of the comfort zone for a little bit and he might come your way again.|`|99afa03db7e3c7d0d99543cb40dd29b6aa	ruined it...now ur destined to be alone.  make sure you aren't so selfish next time.|`|AA11119814	There's still a good chance.  Go for it.  Tell him what you told us here - hey I was really glad when you asked me out for coffee, but sometimes I get really shy.  Is that offer still open?  Unless he's started dating someone else, I bet he'll be interested!!|`|e7b7604e1d2a8383ef9e24bf06e355e3aa	next time you see him go over and talk to him let him know how you feel about him,because he is probably think because he is def you d,NT like him.|`|b11673af8334884904ed6fa8a31c3e80aa	All you have to do is ask him any stupid question like what time do you have and take it from there.  I guarantee you he will continue the conversation.  Don't be so hard on yourself for thinking you missed your chance.  he is probably the one who thinks there is no chance and thats why he stopped attempting.  Fear of rejection.  Take a chance he will understand that you are an extremely busy person, make sure you mention thats why you hadn't been able to set up a date w/him.  If he is a jerk about it and isn't understanding of your busy work life, forget the loser, you are better off with out him anyway and its his loss!  Good luck :)|`|fa2cbaa870f60bee0db725ff451cf631aa	tell him how you feel.. there's always hope..
e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	That would totally depend on the level of the current relationship. What my feelings are for the current person i am with. If it is not that serious and i still have feelings for the x i would end the new and re begin the old. <br>  however, they are an x for some reason, if the reason was something to do with the breaking of my trust, i would not look back.so it really all depends. good luck if you are in this situation you really have to do some soul searching. God bless|`|AA11820856	I would let the past be exactly that, the past.  I would continue with what I have and not go backwards and give the past another chance to make things miserable again|`|AA11328507	An ex is an ex for a reason.  Move on!|`|bf6d80471137ec45c9ca78e781e85048aa	I would date both and decide later on
3c82199bc9ed729fad4b2f3c5053b958aa	if the adress he gave you ends in gmail.com,. then you type in...google emails,........on your computer then that will take you to google emails..Then check through their site to look for a section that says;....."Open a new gmail account"......When you find it, they will give you instructions on how to open a new gmail account for you...Eventually you will end up with a new email adress and/or an access name, and they will also give you a password. These will be new personal private credentials for you  to use on google. Once you have these new credentials, you then look for the section marked up,. "Access gmails". When you find this section it will tell you to type in your details and password etc.This will then get you right into the "contact section".If your friends adress ends in "gmail.com", then send him a message and it should go straight to his inbox. If it does, then he'll be able to tell you how to link up on the google chat line. Dont forget; when you go to gmails (google) website to fill in your credentials; look for the section thats marked,....Free Gmail accounts., and they will guide you through to full access. Once youve done that and sent an email to your friend he will be able to send you a reply to your new gmail credentials. After thats finished leave that and go to a new restart. Now type in; Google chat rooms. Once youre there, they will guide you on how to use your new credentials on how to get inside their chat room site. Once your inside their chat rooms they will guide you on how to use your friends adress to contact him direct person to person... If his adress does not end in,...gmail.com; or google.com,. then you'll have to go to (PLAN.B.)...........Terminate this page and do a complete restart....Type in the,..... Full  Adress.....hes given you and this will take to its site.  Read through this site and look for the section thats marked;....Free Membership,...When you find it they will show you how to get a free access name, and password etc then this will enable you to get inside the chatroom itself....Once inside look for the CONTACT BOX or CONTACT SECTION and then put your friends adress in.....If his adress is accurate, then either the Google or the B. option should be able to get him.....Goodluck........................... NOTE. both the google option and the B. option are both free.)|`|AA11820856	I have never heard of it and maybe who ever told you about it you need to contact them again and double check.  I hope that you find it|`|a795a4cc6dfefa64ac0ce926f7a15039aa	go on to your servers home page and where is says address  type in person.com<br>  I did and it works<br>  good luck
AA11820856	Go for it|`|AA10594704	yes you did the right thing..you did it naturally...go again and try to make a conversation and see how he reacts...that is all the advice I would give for now..since you dont give me a lot of details.

You can't live your whole life being scared of males.|`|2ca6d59472b874e6547e8e729eabd1bbaa	make yourself strong lady,its only you who can help yourself  nobody else.just try to forget it ,you cant delete the past but you surely can erase it from your mind.you should consider yourself lucky that SOB didn't kill you otherwise there are so many little girls who are murdered by these evils of our societies.so cheer up lady and start a new life.|`|e034599e8b6bc1dda3a9bf763a44f2cbaa	First of all report the bastard.  Secondly, go to talk to a counselor
78a143bb30610658d51f4382ac2cfe90aa	It just depends on the guy himself. I have seen a lot of white guys with black girls and vice versa. I support interracial dating since my boyfriend is white and I'm asian. But some people are different and would oppose that.|`|c819982a51a496fe7d0c6510ab3d31e3aa	Caucasian teenaged boys dating African American teenage girls?<br>  <br>  It's what's done now. There was a time when "we" didn't have a choice and our little girls and women were attacked and nothing was done about it. But you can also look at the older generation who also date and marry Caucasian women.  Not too many sista's hook up with Caucasian men though. It's not as readily accepted. The stigma is still there.|`|402a29aa8ee96e985ab53f4af172bd58aa	i see nothing wrong with it because i'm a white girl and want to date a black guy.|`|68d662557c538ffa8c9da44b85ebe334aa	Im all for it, if there is a connection than why try to hide it?  It should be about the two people who care about each other not how others view them.  Besides I know there is still sh*t out there, but every1 should be viewed equal.  Besides im a little biased toward your question anyways haha
510ac03f37302a7918fdedeef80e6591aa	"accidently" bump into her, then stop long enough to say you're really sorry and she'll think- "aww how sweet", then you can start from there! just compliment her clothes or hair or something and you shud be fine..|`|2485c113cd9448754e3d38afa8156dedaa	i apprach my gf by looking good|`|AA11951437	run into to her and ask her for the time. then as you walk away compliment something she is wearing, that way she will know you notice her.|`|d4557f7e61d1c17f8559a35c72dedb33aa	Just be like hey, i have seen you in the halls and i have always wanted to say hi.

d4557f7e61d1c17f8559a35c72dedb33aa	Well I would say that if she is going to fast you just need to talk to her about it. She prolly thinks since ur a guy that you want to do things fast... just explain to her how you feel... and if she doesnt except it then i would let her go.|`|600e95960aa11f55df9e0bbf739839bbaa	Well she called you back so I don't think it pissed her off. I would just call her and let her know that you like spending time with her, but you don't want to rush into anything. If she can't respect your wishes then maybe you should tell her that you might need some space.|`|624565b32fdf971397666995ddd0a0b5aa	totally with you on that. no one night stands. just,,, tell her how u feel about the situation, and if things don't clear up, get another gf. not a gimmie gimmie|`|6759956326e2164e86ae2e187913a3cdaa	"Ive been dating this girl for a little while now"<br>  "I dont see her a "gf" material for now"<br>  <br>  Seems to me your very confused as to what you want...perhaps your sending out mixed signals...dont ignore the poor girl...call her...get together and talk it out...nothing will be gained from avoiding her...|`|9fecda453300f2b9968e01b00f216a31aa	if you're not out for an easy lay and she's not gf material then why worry about it, move on to someone who is more intune with  what you want.<br>  <br>  As for her being pissed, I'd say she's probably at least a little embarassed that you went so far then just stopped, might be wondering if it's something about her|`|AA10909580	If you hadn't stopped when you did, you would probably have regretted it later.  Since she called to see how you're doing, it's possible that she realizes that and respects you for it.  You had already told her that you just wanted to take things slow, so there is no reason she should be angry with you.  Guys like you, wanting to take things slow, are rare.|`|0301c953f2aaf69314696138881c60eeaa	i say u set her straight and i think not answering her was a good idea but dont do it to long and tell her u want to wait|`|878e82bcb76ca22882ecddc69a158914aa	Pissed her off?  No. Embarrassed her? YES!      If you are interested in her,  call her and be honest.

6889c7636da8fcbe9b45cd1634f07cc6aa	It may be just a phase but you will continue to have arguments if you never finish the ones that you start.  If there is an issue don't just let it go so it can be brought up again later to start another fight.  Always finish issues trust me.|`|AA11820856	It sounds like phone conversations are getting boring plus sometimes people will vent their real feelings over the phone before they do in person.  So there could be a signal coming from that|`|a1cb3a3f6383169bd0989532b36c30aeaa	give it up if you argue it will never work|`|e62f5096b91ffe89d8747682e522b381aa	Maybe spending your time together going outdoors, walking to parks and giving one a chance to tell how they've been and watching movies and try not to talk more about yourself on the phone, give him a chance too. Make your relationship more exciting and romantic by spending it together. Greet him at night or maybe he''l greet you sweet dreams. goodluck!
752a57b483fbdca1b05d3c06a0822c6eaa	Definitely this relationship can be saved if both of you are determined.. But one thing is for sure that he has lost your faith and he will have to regain it and it takes some time.. In the meantime you should change your focus from the past happenings and forgive him and look at future..BEST LUCK... HAVE FAITH...|`|AA11820856	It sounds to me like you are alot more in love with him then he is with you.  Or he wouldn't have dipped his wick in something else while out of town.  Take a serious look at this relationship because it looks like it could lead to a falling out|`|2d230cc5cda298c84b2f0727cf2aa5a4aa	only if you both accept jesus as lord and repent from your sins so you can be saved.|`|613bcd9efa081d02e88fb96759ea4523aa	Trust is hard to regain. It's always hard to know if a person who has cheated on you is truly sorry they did and would never do it again or if they feel that they can always explain and apologize and you will forgive them. You deserve someone who will be just as committed to making the relationship work as you are. You don't want to go through wondering when he is away if he is with someone else. I believe counseling after cheating is something that can really help.|`|9eaf96532b79bd272e3aeecbfe9b755caa	Im sorry i dont want to sound cynical but i have been cheated on, and im sorry to say but if he strayed once he can and will do it again.It is in the mans nature like a animal he is gonna hunt and alot of guys can see having sex with someone else no big deal as long as he has his love at home they can seperate sex and love.But once the trust is broken you will never be able to trust him no matter how hard you try it will be in the back or your mind.Like when he is traveling if he dont call when he is suppose to or if you call and he dont answer the phone you will have it in the back of your mind that he is with someone else.Its hard to get the trust back i know i have been there done that.|`|AA10421557	remember this, many couples celebrating their silver anniversary had survived affairs. so take heart. forgive him and tell him how much the affair hurt you and just forget about it.

You must have it or your relationship is bound to fail.  Rather the two of you can work it out, depends on both individuals.  I personally think it will be tough, but if you love him, I think you should give it a chance.  You'll know rather it can or cannot work out.  I have been in this situation, and for me, it didn't work out.  I never regained the trust for my partner and it eventually ruined us.  Good luck in whatever you choose to do, I wish you the best....|`|AA11893619	Leave him.<br>  <br>  It's not the first time he has cheated on you.<br>  <br>  As a bloke I hear other blokes bragging about cheating on there wives quite often.<br>  <br>  He cant be trusted and he thinks that your a sucker.<br>  <br>  He needs to know that there are adverse consequences for his foolish actions.

Ask for some personal info, but keep it friendly. This way, he doesn't feel like he has respond right away, and he might be nervous about talking to you in person.

La mayoría nos casamos por necesidad de algo. Algunos le llaman amor a necesitar a alguien. pero nada más lejano del amor. Amar es estar dispuesto a dar y compartir sin esperar nada. aceptar al otro tal cual es y no quererlo cambiar a como nos gustaría que fuera.

Depende también de la edad de los hijos, si son muy chicos una separación dejará en ellos un da?o irreparable, pero si ya se vive en un ambiente de violencia, aunque no más sea verbal, entonces tal vez habría que plantear la separación. Tal vez te sientas muy subestimada como mujer porque no encuentras satisfacción y el no muestra interés en complacerte. Siempre fue así, o al principio sí tenían buenas relaciones? Pues si siempre fue así él puede no entender cuál es tu problema, o lo más sencillo de pensar es que creerá que lo que es bueno para él para ti también tiene que serlo. Muchas veces los hombres no entienden que tenemos necesidades diferentes. Tienes que escuchar a tu corazón y buscar soluciones prácticas. Si te separas ?vas a tener problemas económicos, tienes como mantener a tus tres hijos? No estoy diciendo que debas quedarte por interés, sólo que estés prevenida, para que, en el caso de que se produzca la separación, no quedes en inferioridad de condiciones.|`|70d8f9c69f7489c13ca1c0a256cce21faa	Yo soy partidaria a que si las cosas no funcionan no hay que forzarlas, se que es más difícil si hay hijos de por medio, pero que estés separada no implica que pierdan a su padre...<br>  El tema es que hoy tienes que pensar que tu felicidad y a de tus hijos esta en juego, porque si en la casa hay mal clima ellos lo receptan!.

Porque no soy mujer de una sola noche y mucho menos soy de varios hombres muy mal que se ve eso el tener que verme a escondidas o acostarme con otro hombre en otra cama y llegar a mi casa después como la mas Sra casada no estoy de acuerdo.

Me parece que es natural que las personas nos sintamos atraidas por otras y no necesariamente debamos querer estar con alguien para toda la vida. El matrimonio es una institución, un contrato entre partes que debe cumplirse pues si no, no tiene sentido como tal. Si nos decidimos a dar el gran paso, entonces debemos estar convencidos de lo que queremos. No creo que uno planee ser infiel, creo que es algo que simplemente ocurre o no. De llegar a ser infiel, trataría de que mi pareja no lo sepa jamás. A mi me parece que si uno es infiel, no tiene que ver mucho con la otra persona, es algo más de uno, ni siquiera creo que hace falta que la pareja esté en crisis.|`|685b61ba8695103b9918c5279212b2c6aa	NO....!!<br>  POR ESO ME CASE CON EL ....

Pero el instinto, la atracción sexual, son naturales.En iguales condiciones, las mujeres podríamos ser más infieles de lo que somos, pues nuestra sexualidad es más completa y más compleja que la del hombre, por lo tanto más difícil de satisfacer.

Para decir, no tienes mucho, si es un problema orgánico, ahora si en esos días ella está muy perturbada, tal vez sea porque todo el mes está mal y sólo empeora en esos momentos.

A mi a veces también me pasa, y me gusta sentirme querida por los seres a los que aprecio. También podrías averiguar si no le esta pasando nada aparte de estar en esos días. fijate si cambia su estado cuando no esta en esos días y si el estado de tristeza continua, comenza a preguntarle que le sucede si tiene algún problema. sino solo es cuestión de demostrarle afecto y hacerle mimos.<br>  Suerte.

8164b59d38cdf333ec8d5e84111db2d5aa	I didn't used to believe in the concept of a "soulmate." I think love is a mix of various emotions, including lust, trust, comfort, etc. I married a man I loved, but it didn't work. I couldn't figure out why: all of the elements of a good marriage were there: communication, understanding, willingness to work out our problems, trust... but in the end, it just wasn't right, and we had to admit our mistake and divorce. I thought a lot about love and about what I really wanted in a life-mate, and the qualities that came up kept reminding me of my best male friend of ten years. I swallowed my pride and told him how I felt. To my suprise, he told me he'd been in love with me since high school. The moment I told him I loved him, I could feel that everything was different with him than with any other man i'd ever been with. Even my husband. I feel as though I finally know my exact path in life, which steps to take and how to make my decisions. For every step I take, I feel as if i've taken it before. I finally make sense to myself. It's absolutely incredible! Keep in mind i'm a scientist, and an athiest to boot. I always tell him that the atoms that make the two of us up must have once belonged to the inner core of the same cosmic star eons ago. I don't know how to explain it, but we are two halves of the same whole. You will know when you meet your soulmate. There is no question in my mind about that!|`|AA11344897	You'll know when you feel like vomiting|`|108d95007edc0232348d643517033089aa	love is an emotional thing, just be patient and will feel it within you<br>  goodluck|`|350d7a71b9498934a7975cc471501629aa	the answer isn't clear cut.  soulmate is such a difficult thing to define because today he may be... but tomorrow he may change his mind (or your mind/heart changes).  enjoy your time together....and apart.  if you are apart, do you feel his presence?|`|73809a43ced326ce4a397acf89181764aa	I think you just know, by how you feel when you are with them and when you are not.

His anger and frustration is directed in the wrong place. Maybe he was hit when he was a kid and doesn't know any better. Or maybe he is a mean SOB who doesn't care about the feelings of others. Either way, no one should ever be hit. It is wrong and hurtful, and it needs to stop. I would call the police and press charges.

There is probably so much on his mind (about to have a baby in the house, no job, how will he support his family, etc) that his drive is shot.<br>  <br>  What other activities is he still doing that he is enjoying?  Playing video games? Or something else?  If it's games, he actually might not be enjoying them, but it's rather a way from him to escape from the reality of what's going on, even if it's for a couple hours.  He needs a jump start from the sounds of it.  He needs to quit doing "other" activities that he enjoys and concentrate solely on getting a job to support his family.

As for no oral given to you only him, he sounds to be a man in bed that has it wrong. He may think it is all about his pleasure, which is an issue in itself. Both should be willing to please the other in bed. As for not wanting sex with you now maybe it is the pregnancy that has him turned around. While most men think pregnant ladies are all that maybe he thinks opposite. As for the cheating I do not want to burst your bubble but how would anyone know 100% that their spouse is not cheating. I am married 27 years and while I can say I do not think he has, I could not stake my life on that. If talking to him does not work strongly I would suggest getting professional help. There is an issue here that is clear. See if things go back to normal after your pregnancy and if not consider options such as professional help|`|dad11ab78b49975a0f958615ba549d8aaa	Always remember ur beautiful, ur 9mos pregnant and glowing!

The only advice I can give is find out what makes him hard, may be a fetish or something and do that.  Try getting a porno, or take him to a strip joint, or play games.  Read and try everything until you find what makes him horny, if nothing works then he has a very low sex drive and you will a problem.|`|e499cc2d1f4f4aefd7f159ea74492043aa	did you say your nine months pregnant ? and he is lying about not masterbating|`|e90308c65016d9a33d2a1319552b19b8aa	You shattered his manlyhood by bitching about doing all the work.<br>  <br>  Now, of course he has no drive.  Why would he even want to try if you already bitched about it?<br>  <br>  Stress can be a small part yes. May be your being so far along in your pregnancy doesn't turn him on either.  It doesn't all men.<br>  <br>  Wait tell the baby is born.

Most men not all men actually become MORE attracted to pregnant women, he may not be but I don't think that is the problem. He may be depressed or whatever the other people say but that's not a good excuse to deny your wife, especially, if he's not working because he really doesn't have anything better to do. You need to watch his actions and WHO he does his "other or normal activities" with. I smell a cheater just because you can't tell from the surface doesn't mean that it is not going on. Also if he used to be a tomcat and now he's a kitten, it's not because of low sex drive, he had enough drive to get you pregnant. If he can't meet you half way on ALL sexual activities you two need to seriously talk about that because no sex should not be the foundation of your marriage but it makes up a BIG part. Good luck
a6d4d81534532f52bed5ce2f24e1fc28aa	The dressing up thing is a good idea, by the way! All you have to do to give "mind blowing" sex is to listen to the way he responds to what you are doing. Give him a little strip tease or something. Try a new position. As for the hand job my only advice is don't squeeze too hard, and ask him to help show you so you will know what he likes! Good luck!|`|5385f9885a2e4f9643c2d418afe162c3aa	Hand job..lubricant and a steady motion. It is when you pause, he loses it.

Also, if you don't think about yourself, but instead of your partnet, you'll also receive just as much pleasure.|`|f4ff72b32c141cb58ec8ed5a0297c2e3aa	Well just do what feels good for the both of you ;) add a lil oral to the hand job|`|AA11820856	Well if it is limited to the hands then forget the mind blowing sex because your not doing anything that he can't and probably has done already.

Another associate and I soon became attatched at the hip, taking breaks/ lunches together, we even swapped cars for a few days, but we firmly maintained that we were just friends (we were both in relationships.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, I guess it drove the rest of the employees so crazy, that our store manager came up to us one day in the parking-lot after work and said "If you two drop the best friend's bit, I'll pay for your first date." <br>  <br>  He gave us over $100 in gift certificates to a local restaurant!|`|AA12132693	I do....<br>  <br>   I met this guy that I was working with, about 16 yrs ago..although it was only a crush in the beginning...we ended up dating, getting Married, having 2 kids...& then sadly, after 10 yrs of Marriage, we have been divorced for almost 3 yrs now.<br>  <br>   I am currently dating someone who came into my job all the time....we have been together for awhile now, & things are going pretty good...|`|3041c84da9fa2c31440b6af5d45027abaa	This may not be a crush but I think it takes the prize!<br>  <br>  The General Manager came down the hall from the Conference Room.

I am so glad I took that crappy job.|`|AA11772335	Not me, but the fact that two Bed Bath and Beyond employees decided to knock it out in the bedding department's stockroom shelves is pretty damn funny.

AA11929147	first of all u cant ingnore someone who is already ingnoring u.and 2edly he probably wants to be more than friends and if your not picking up on this mabey he is playing hard to get.he wants you to think about him alot and it sims to be working.so start talking to his friends and tell your girl friends how you feel and if they r your real friends then they will help you out by treating him like he dose you.|`|0e7ad426641bc073e41220853e2cd85eaa	He probably liked you and now you've confused him. Maybe you're making the poor dog chase his tail too fast :)|`|725ae792de3441d005cdc26657b9e04caa	He probably likes you alot but is now conscious about why you are ignoring him. Or he might be afraid you know something he doesn't or that you might be telling other people bad stuff about him. Or someone might have tipped him off that you were ignoring him as well and now he might be afraid that his hard to get may never unfold. It might be best to clear the air on this one so you don't make a permanent enemy out of someone you used to like. Especially over you guys both playing a little game by ignoring each other. Not worth it to lose a friend or make an enemy over that.|`|f564c37959986cba1d54660b1d336652aa	He's ignoring you to probably see how you'd react and then when you started ignoring him it threw off his game that he thought he had going for him.. guys are sort of dumb like that. So now that you're not talking to him he has to go and try to figure out what happened and to try and talk to you again. Give it a little more time he might come around and if he doesn't well.. you can either continue to not talk to him or you can go ahead and try to talk to him and see what he does. If he's really excited to talk to you finally or if he's not really into talking to you. Ya never know.|`|8dd09abedb39b869d2a14fe44855d831aa	yes maybe|`|fa2609bee33130d08fd56e5aab6d7c6baa	OK he probably wasn't intentionally ignoring you, or he thought that was over, now your ignoring him and hes confused why,  I am actually having the same problem|`|13a7104d101477722262c49115ee1c59aa	how OLD are you! that behaviour is childish, FUN but childish. also seems like you like the dude!!, talk to him, be the bigger person

He may be really nice to you when you are alone, but unfortunately the reason is probably because he wants to get intimate with you. As soon as you give him what he wants, hes in charge and knows it.

AA10975588	First you have to get a common denominator, since you can't use 6 or 7, then you need a number by which 6 and 7 can be divided, the only way to get it is multiplying 6 times 7, which is 42, so draw a line and put "42" below it. Then divide 42 by 6 and you get 7, multiply 7 times 2 (from 2/6) and that is 14, so on top of the line write "14" and the "+" sign. do the same with 3/7; divide 42 by 7 and you get 6, then 6 times 3 (from 3/7) is 18, write that next to the "+" sign. Add 14+18 and that will give you 32, that equals 32/42, reduce it to the minimun dividing it by 2, that is 16/21, and that is the answer. follow the same procedure with 5/3-2/4, only that in this case you will use the "-" sign instead the "+" sign.|`|cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	2/6 + 3/7<br>  Find the least common multiple first for the denominator.<br>  <br>  which is 42 (6x7 =42) (7x6 =42)<br>  <br>  mulitply 2/6 by 7/7 (always multiply the top and the bottom) = 14/42<br>  multiply 3/7 by 6/6 =  21/42<br>  <br>  now 14/42 + 21/42 = 35/42<br>  (only add numerator, denominator stays the same)<br>  In lowest terms<br>  35/42 divided by 7/7 (because 7 is the Lowest Common Multiple)= 5/6<br>  Answer= 5/6<br>  <br>  Now do the same for 5/3 - 2/4<br>  5/3 multiplied by 4/4 =20/12<br>  2/4 multiplied by 3/3 =6/12<br>  20/12 - 6/12 = 8/12<br>  Into lowest terms 8/12 divided by 4/4 =2/3<br>  Answer 2/3<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Good luck|`|5472912519051908ed850d6ecdf22934aa	Well, when you add or subtract fractions, you first have to have a common base or bottom number or denominator.<br>  <br>  So, wha'ts the smallest number that both 6 and 7 go into evenly? Probably 42.<br>  <br>  You get to 42 from 6 by multiplying by 7; you get to 42 from 7 by multiplying by 6.<br>  <br>  Since you multiplied the 6 on the bottom of 2/6 by 7, you have to multiply the top by 7, so 2/6 = 14/42.<br>  <br>  Since you multiplied the 7 on the bottom of 3/7 by 6, you have to multiply the top by 6, so 3/7 = 18/42.<br>  <br>  14/42 + 18/42 = 32/42 (you don't add or subtract bottoms, just tops) which you can reduce to 16/21.<br>  <br>  Now do the same with the next problem: convert to a common denominator, apply that conversion rate to the top numbers, then subtract.<br>  <br>  5/3 - 2/4 = a/12 - b/12 (got there by multiplying by 4 or 3, respectively)<br>  <br>  5/3 = 20/12<br>  2/4 = 6/12<br>  <br>  20/12 - 6/12 = 14/12 = 1 & 2/12 = 1  & 1/6<br>  <br>  Hope that saves your marriage and by the way, your female offspring are called "daughters".|`|AA11245961	find the first common denominator then do the math ex:1/2+3/4 would go to 2/4+3/4 which equals 5/4 or 1 1/4.

bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Well, you young people want to do this crazy, he's my friend although of the opposite sex thing, which is just really bizzare.  In all of history, boys and girls were not "friends" in the way that you folks are doing this today.  Historically the opposite sex has not "hung out" together or to the extent they did it all revolved around dating and/or the pursuit of a romantic relationship.  But you turn everything upside down and just completely confuse things when you find the opposite sex as desirable potentially as "just a friend" as you do as a "bf/gf."  I just don't know how to help.|`|df448f7cf16903b4104426b7c9b005f4aa	if he really is beginning to annoy you, i would gently but firmly say to him that although he's a good friend and you like him etc. you don't like spending too much time on your mobile. you are busy at home etc and you just need to limit the time you spend texting and chatting. just tell him straight. i had to do it with a female friend of mine who was doing it as she had nothing better to do. she's calmed down since. if he still persists i would turn your phone off sometimes when you know he's calling just untill he gets the hint, or i would not reply to the texts.  sounds like he's getting a little bit possesive. be careful!|`|4d6da8c56014b6ce4fcbd194aa0e7bbbaa	just tell him u just want to be friends with him and nothing else and see if works|`|c8a21ac5b74cd303fbca481e76bb1e04aa	Tell him how you feel about the situation.this will help in this way;you will get to know whether he's a true friend who respects you and yo ideas or he's been on another mission.However texting a friend is not bad...i mean his intentions might not be what yo thinking about.good time
afd220602c57083c3ba7fec70f97c488aa	How to know when a guy likes you <br>  Here are some things to look for to know when a guy likes you: <br>  <br>  1. Keep an eye on how many times you catch her/him staring at you. <br>  <br>  2. Take notice of whether s/he smiles at you a lot. <br>  <br>  3. Look for whether s/he focuses on you in a crowd. <br>  <br>  4. Observe if s/he has suddenly taken more interest in your friends. <br>  <br>  5. Pay attention to any significan't changes in her/his behavior toward you recently. <br>  <br>  6. Start showing her/him a bit more interest and see how they respond. <br>  <br>  7. Have a friend talk to her/him or one of her/his friends about you. <br>  <br>  8. Ask, '[name], are you interested in me?' Tips: Hopefully you will not have to use steps 7 or 8, but if you're having difficulty reading her/him, these steps are your last resort! Remember, this is not an exact science, and it may take a few mistakes to perfect your technique. <br>  <br>  <br>  More Ways:<br>  <br>  The easiest way to tell (for anyone) is to just take an innocent step into their personal space. If they aren't interested then they will step away. If they are interested then they will set closer boundries for you and will therefore not mind your closer-than-normal presense. <br>  <br>  One of the signs that a boy likes you is when he always teases you or makes fun/jokes. <br>  <br>  He seems to find reasons to be with or near you. He may come up with what you think are lame or legit reasons to speak to you, call you, ask something. Try watching if he looks into your eyes or at least eye contact when he talks to you. Does he find ways to be closer to your body, near you, sit close or on the same side of the room as you? Does he talk to you instead of at you? Does he want your opinion? Cares what you have to say? Does he seem to be around you often, when he can? Does his face lighten up or seem to go from stress to unstressed when you walk in or say hello? A guy may not be obvious about it either, especially if he's shy, or maybe a little unsure of himself, which doesn't mean he's a loser at all but probably warmer from with in or more depth to him, more sensitive. <br>  <br>  Boys might not tell you directly, but they may tell someone. Or perhaps when you are not around but your friend is there he will ask for you. <br>  <br>  You will know if a guy likes you because he will not hesitate to make eye-contact; he will either stare if he thinks you won't notice or hold your gaze when you catch him in the act (if he has a lot of confidence). If a guy is interested, he will also go out of his way to be as near you as possible without being obvious. Of course, the rules don't apply to all men, but generally, if he likes you, you WILL know it, without a doubt. <br>  <br>  I'm a guy and I think it depends, and different guys are different. Eye contact and attention isn't always the best way to tell. If a guy is shy he may get intimidated by girls he likes and actually make less eye contact <br>  <br>  I'm a guy, and I find it real hard to let a girl know I like her. I try to be funny, I smile (because I can't help it), I try to be close to her, but I can't verbally let her, or anyone know. Many guys have the same problem. <br>  <br>  I'm a guy. If a guy is into you, he will ask you out, or he'll most definitely go out with you when you ask him first. There are no exceptions to that rule, unless he was with someone else at the time and wants to be true to them. So unfortunately, if a guy does not go out with you when you ask him out, he does not like you. <br>  <br>  Here are some of the signs: he acts distracted when he's around you and fumbles for things. From the corner of your eye you think he is looking at you but when you look up he turns away abruptly and you think you are imagining things. He tries to like all the things you do. Your instinct tells you that he feels for you but your rational part says you are sure to be wrong. <br>  <br>  I think you can tell if a guy likes you if he always looks at you, he always wants to see you smile, he doen't like it when other guys talk to you, he looks at you when you are doing something, he follows you places, he doesn't know how to act when he is with you. <br>  <br>  A guy is interested in a girl if he says "yes" to things she asks him to do. Time is very valuable to a guy, and if he is obliging and generous with his time, a girl certainly has his attention. Especially if he's a busy guy, he'll make time for a girl if he likes you. <br>  <br>  He will make you feel special. He will be romantic. He will not move too fast. He will consider your feelings and take things slow. <br>  <br>  He will show off, sometimes on small things. (For example, my crush at the moment was drinking infront of me, but then stopped when I said it was uncool.) <br>  <br>  I knew a guy who would try to embarass his friends when they were around me. He wanted to look funny and seem cooler than his friends. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a guy who likes you can behave in a very confusing way and be hard to understand. It might make you wonder whether they like you or hate you. <br>  <br>  Shy guys like me will most likely tell their friends. Some will be confused if you flirt with them because they have never had this happen before, so they don't know what to do. Most guys don't do things unless they know exactly what they are doing. Girls just confuse us. <br>  <br>  A guy likes you if he: 1. Makes fun of you. 2. Has cute little nicknames for you. 3. Remembers everything you say, in the smallest most insignificant conversations. 4. Finds any excuse to touch you or sit next to you. 5. Talks and looks at you differently than other people. 6. Talks about you with your friends. <br>  <br>  A confident guy is easier to read. He'll make eye contact. Shy guys can be very hard to read but there are some sure signs: They might be looking at you but if you look back then they'll quickly look away. He will always laugh at funny things you do. Don't get discouraged if he talks more to other girls. Shy guys are very attracted to outgoing girls, so don't be afraid to be outgoing! Here's what you can do: when you're in a group of people and he's there, ask to the group if anyone would like to go on a walk, or go do something with you. Be sure that it would be a two person activity. If the guy you like agrees, then this is good. You can guarantee you'll have a good conversation with him if you ask a lot of questions. Be sure to tell him if you have soemthing in common. <br>  <br>  Confident men who aren't afraid to stare at you and ask you out may just want you for the sex. <br>  <br>  Sometimes a guy will pretend to flirt with other girls in your presence, to make you jealous. <br>  <br>  I tend to like shy guys, so it may be hard to read them at first. But, once they open up, they give you their confidence completely. I find that they will: 1. Make eye contact with you, then look away when your eyes meet. 2. Always be willing to help you our or do you favors (like rides home, or physical work). 3. Will always look for you in a crowd, then when he finds you will act like he doesn't see you. 4. Will laugh at all your jokes/will try to make you laugh. 5. Talks to his friends about you. 6. Mentions activities that you are interested in so there is a chance for you two to do them together. 7. Will always find a reason to talk to you or touch you in any way. 8. Pokes fun at you, but in a nice way (unless he is very young and immature). 9. Seems genuinely interested in what you have to say. 10. Remembers little things that you've talked about before a long time ago, and brings them up in conversations to let you kjnow that he remembered. 11. He will always stare at you, and your friends may notice it too. 12. When you are talking with him and your friends, he will only comment on something that you say, or will look at you whenever he speaks. I hope that these help, but remember, you can't always rely on physical things. I think that most of all it is a feeling. If he likes you, your instinct tells you. Go with your gut. Don't let your logic tell you any different. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend the new book: "He's just not that into you." It is so right on about how to tell if a guy likes you! :) Actually, the first rule of thumb is that a guy will ask you out if he likes you. To get him comfortable enough to do that, all you have to do is smile and seem interested in him as a person (just in case he's the shy type). <br>  <br>  A guy who likes you may tend to notice new things about you, and compliment you. <br>  <br>  The truth is, most girls can tell if a guy likes them. If you get the feeling that he likes you, you're probably right.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!!!!!!!,<br>  Kaylin|`|b81e1b1ed0d83c85da2da248d1f01b78aa	most generaly, he will want to be around you, will pay lots of attention to you and will find ways to be close to you a whole lot|`|5022ac3853f3af9da94564812e6d7462aa	He looks at you a lot but looks other way when you look at him.

Being the girl that he doesnt like can be hard and ego upsetting.  I would tell her this guy has asked you out and you said yes.  Also tell her your sorry cause you know she likes him to and ask if this is going to be a problem with her.  If it is then she isnt a good friend.  But if she says its okay and that she will get over it... then you know and you are good to go and that you really do have a good friend.<br>  Either way go out with the guy.|`|2f8697f42c88fccb3cb056f71cbfb00daa	What ever you do dont  do something extremly risky to the friendship.

If only things were so simple. I'll tell you this. Just ask him. This will save you a lot of time. If he says no, then you can understand that he doesn't and may not even after knowing you for a bit of time. Therefore, it will be him who regrets later on when he falls for you in return, granted you guys will hang out and stuff... Maybe not, since if he does reject you, it will be too embarassing... So what you can do is this....<br>  <br>  "Do you like me?"<br>  <br>  "No."<br>  <br>  "I knew it! I don't like you either." Haha!<br>  <br>  "Do you like me?"<br>  <br>  "Yes, as a friend."<br>  <br>  "Me too. I was worried because I thought you didn't like me as a friend..." Saved!<br>  <br>  If he says he likes you in a way that he likes you likes you and not as friend, then you've just scored yourself your dream guy.<br>  <br>  Signs that he likes you He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.<br>  <br>  He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)<br>  <br>  He does things to deliberately gain your attention.<br>  <br>  He stutters when he speaks to you.<br>  <br>  His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.<br>  <br>  He waits for you. He looks out for you.<br>  <br>  He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.<br>  <br>  He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.<br>  <br>  He listens to you and actually remembers little details.<br>  <br>  He notices slight changes in your appearance.<br>  <br>  He seems sad when you ignore him.<br>  <br>  He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.<br>  <br>  His friends all know you when you don't know them.<br>  <br>  He smiles back when you smile at him.<br>  <br>  He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!<br>  <br>  He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.<br>  <br>  Signs that he is a player<br>  <br>  He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.<br>  <br>  He places his hands on you with ease.<br>  <br>  Every other girl likes him.<br>  <br>  Just be careful.<br>  <br>  There are many more signs, but anyway, just go with your heart, take care of yourself, and let things happen naturally.

I could always call this bestfriend to help me go somewhere, and sometimes, he is very much uneasy around me. He knew that my relationship with my bf back then is very strong, and he didn't want to ruin it... so he decided not to communicate for a year or two.<br>  <br>  but then when my bf and i broke up, this bestfriend showed up, and told me that he likes me. More than a friend. The reason he decided not to talk to me, the reason why he feels uneasy around me, is that because he knew that I could never let another man touch me in anyway (and i'm gonna give him a punch right at his face) and that he's feeling something for me.<br>  He's now my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  It would be better if you guys talk about it. If it affects your friendship, then he's a fool for letting it. I had another bestfriend who liked me the same way, but I have decided it would be best if we just stay like that. And up to now, we're still bestfriends.|`|6UUueelXaa	im sure it can happen i like this guy bt i dnt no if he thinks of me the same way|`|zAkPpIjaaa	It can happen!|`|b0f25726107aa6530948c6e72e1d5512aa	if you are close to each other, there is a large possibility.

36e854e8ea5993373c23f2804a27ecb4aa	The girl's view - Well, regardless of whether you actually tell him or not, trust me he's going to find out. :) So you might want to come clean. If you're really afraid he'll freak, approach the subject gently. Maybe ask him about his first time. Maybe he's a virgin, too? In any case, you're better off telling him. It's a win-win situation: if he doesn't freak, he'll be beter prepared to help you along. If he does, well, he's a big a**hole and you'll have not wasted your first time on him. :)<br>  <br>  The guy's view- You really should tell him. Talking about things like this is a very important part of any health relationship. If he is a virgin himself then taking it slow is the best thing. Work on first explorering each other bodies, which can be an even better the just have sex. If he freaks a little don't worry, if he really cares he will come around. And just because he freaks doesn't make him an a$$hole, makes him concern. Would you like to be with someone who is concerned for you or just doesn't give a care.<br>  <br>  This answer was answered by two people and each ins there own opinion.|`|mVlA3u3zaa	What's wrong with a virgin.. If I were him, I would be so honored and thankful... Tell him before you make out, and plan it romantically..

xRm5IC54aa	its healthy to fight sometime just not all the time.<br>  maybe you two need to sit down and talk about everythin and if you 2 cant do that with out fighting maybe you take some time away from each other to think about everything.<br>  And to answer "is it really love" you 2 must of loved each other to get married in the first place so i would say yes but i really think you 2 should try and talk or have some space from each other for a few days.<br>  Small things arent worth fighting over.|`|d75a215506dd9f3e3ff03a3892cfb7c0aa	dunno.  is it?   quit fighting.  notice the things that you fight about and agree to disagree or change those things that you can to make your relationship more peaceful.|`|mVlA3u3zaa	Well, there'll always be fights in a marriage..

It's not all that hard. I don't understand why people are so afraid to tell their crush how they feel. For all you know, your friend is telling him freaky things about you so she can have him for herself. Just tell him how you feel and end the torture.|`|92234a2b89bf543e6d2f0158c8dc1d38aa	Ask him first whats the worst he will say "no".|`|bd596e10d4432af2dccae49c8bab6089aa	if she os truely your friend than she is telling the truth :]<br>  if shes lying, well you dont need that kindof person in your life|`|d03cfdeb099a1c1bfb5cf098f06aae2faa	I think  that true friends to not date their  friend's  ex's under any circumstances.

AA10009293	Let me begin by explaining it from my point of view, as the single guy looking at my friend with a boyfriend:<br>  <br>  As a guy, I learned that there are limitations to the type of relationships that I can hold with another female, platonically.  This means that unless I was going to be with her intimately, there was going to be a moment in my life where we would have to create some space to keep our relationships with that special someone going.  In my case, I knew that she could not keep seeing me on a weekly basis because her boyfriend really cared for her; he was jealous of the relationship we held.  If it is naturally for someone to question such a close relationship, especially when there is a connection.  Well, we understandingly opted to remain good friends, but not as close.  While she went out with him, I only saw her once to twice a year; it depended upon our schedules and the festive seasons.  Nonetheless, I respected that fine line.  Additionally, she respected her boyfriend, whom she cares about; she did not want to make him feel uncomfortable.  We talked to each other every few months on the phone to make plans for the annual cookout or christmas party.<br>  <br>  Today, 3-4 years later, she is single.  She cares about him, but as a friend.  We are better friends because of it.  It was that understanding.  It is that respect that I hold for such a relationship.<br>  <br>  My advice for you is that you have to know when to back off and give him space.  Just explain to him that you really care about the feelings of your boyfriend and that you cannot see him all the time.  Explain why... boys, jealousy, etc.  Hopefully, he understands and will respect what you have with him.  In the end, you will know whether this person genuinely cares about what is important to you enough to understand how things work.  <br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|6d84a51b34973d3db0451e0966538a55aa	Just be honest. He is your friend, after all, and if you're happy, he should want that more than anything. Tell him that you do understand how he feels, because that is something that people in pain want to hear. They don't want to feel alone. <br>  <br>  Just be gentle and remind him that you still love him as a friend, and you don't want to see him hurt, but you are happy and that should make him at least a little bit happy. If he is willing to wait it out and see if you and your man work out, then give him a shot. It sounds like he's waited long enough :)|`|d31906ec4b137ba9407af89c7bc7c52caa	look,if he is urclose friend,then dont worry and tell him.he will be happy.don't woory go go go go.life is calling,where are u?|`|d75a215506dd9f3e3ff03a3892cfb7c0aa	he knows you have a boyfriend.  remind him.  peace|`|zAkPpIjaaa	hmm by withholding sex.

If he still acts strange after several days, ask for a heart to heart talk, communication helps solve ur worries.
czfqMfw2aa	well first of all u cant make a guy like u. but a guy can start to like you. talk about movies, songs, Do u like Rock?  dont talk about rock if u have no idea about any bands bc that will go nowhere. if u do then thats a great topic. talk about your life his life so far. dont change urself for him though he should like you for who u are so ya.... find out if you share common likes basically. all i could tell you is to talk and c where it goes from there. if it is meant to be it will happen dont force it then you could lose him as a friend forever.|`|azhmnAhzaa	you cannot Make anyone like you, so all you can do is be yourself.

Leaving your family and friends is hard, but you can keep in touch, and will probably make some new friends.  It is very hard to start over in a strange place, but succeeding in school is very important.  As an adult, except for unforseen events, you will not regret your decision.  I say go for it.  Talk to your parents about a plan if that truly does not work out.  They will probably let you come back home.|`|liYX9M8iaa	i say go for it if you dont like it transfer back or just try it for a year then decide wats a year away from ur friends thats wat fones are for|`|m4zjoSXGaa	well, if it's better for your education, then you should do it. that helps you as you grow up. and maybe you'll make more friends. different friends. friends aren't the world.  and if the girls there are prissy and bratty, then complain to your parents and tell them that you want to move schools again. but it's your call. do what you think is best for you in the future.

Do what you feel like doing, but know this, you'll be giving him more to think about and possibly if he tells his gf and others, ruin plenty of social bonds.|`|c720f18d5ff47be9e8559720adf278ceaa	I would tell him because you don't want to regret that you never said anything.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|NRpqiWtcaa	Yeah I would.  Its better to always express your feelings. but be sure you tell him that you don't expect anything from him because he has a girlfriend (unless your one to help cheat on someone), but I'm sure he'd enjoy knowning that despite all thats happening, a lot of people still love him and are there for him.|`|a93253cad7d825897d4f715a89104cddaa	no you shouldnt<br>  it will make him feel miserable and make him feel like a bad person<br>  just keep these feelings to urself and i know its gonna hurt but think of him

You shouldn'y have to think about what other people think of you. It doesn't matter if you go out with an unpopular guy. As long as hes understanding polite, and cares about you. <br>  Boy two, I have no idea what he looks like but I quickly got an picture in my head of him. Being popular, do you really wanna waste your time with an obnoxious guy who changes when certain people come around? Not really, well I wouldn't. :)|`|AA11345140	I thought this going out with popular boys bcuz u r popular only happened on tv now i know, its in real life. Anyway, if a guy really likes you for you, he should b able to act the same way around u whether his friends r there or not. It shows that he gives in to peer pressure easily(which is not good). His friends could easily manipulate him into hurting u. The not so popular guy seems to have a genuine liking for u and doesn't care what other ppl think, neither should u. It's up to u to make the right choice.

It doesn't matter if it was from you mom, dad, sister, brother, cat, dog, teacher, aunt, uncle, friend or anybody else.

And with out that someone to help and suppprt them, or be there for them, they act up, or make wrong choices in life.<br>  I also think that love is magical. It appears when your heart feels like it.

uQaVoM2oaa	Friends are important becasue both people can learn alot from each other, through themselves, and the experiences they bring to one another. People care so much for there friends that when they go through something its almost like your doing it too, I think it helps you grow as a person.

Through the good and bad friends us better people in the end.|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	Friends aren't that important I think friends aren't in need. You don't need them. But theres a special thing about having a good friend. When having a good true friend, you feel much happier, and better. Even though part of friendship involves different conflicts its still okay, cuz you know your friend will always have your back, and like you for who you are, not for what u look like or what u have. They will respect you at all times, and never turn against you. There always ready to cheer you up, and courage you. Thats one important aspact about having friends. There pretty cool.

cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	E-mail him and tell him in a way. If your friends, chat and say something like "uhhh, I'm sick of dumb guys, I wish I could meet a guy just like you, cuz were so cool together." This way if he likes you, he will pipe up and  say something. If he doesn't like you like that and says we're just friends, then say "yeah, I know, I just mean I want a guy that is nice and I get along with like you, thats all." So that way you don't risk ruining the relationship.<br>  Good luck to you sweetie.

cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Well in my opinion, he should tell her, he is done wit her and for her to stop pursuing him. He shouldn't be texting her. That makes me wonder why he's doing it behind your back. I would wonder and worry to. But if he tells you he doesn't like her, and that he isn't doing anything with her, then the next time she calls or text, tell him you want to talk to her.<br>  You let her know what is up, and to leave him alone and tell her to move on. After that, tell him no more talkin to her. If he gets mad, he has something to hide.<br>  Bring up the fact that you don't do this. Ask him would he be ok with you chatting with an X behind his back that wants you?<br>  He will probably say no.<br>  But yeah, I would be a little suspicious because he still talks to her, basically giving her false hope.<br>  <br>  Good luck

Expressing our wants for one another's closeness, touching one another, being playful in the most intimate of ways, and seeing each other have so much want made it all so awesome.  Maybe both of you might benefit from experimenting and learning about one another's bodies and wants or desires, rather than just getting into it could enhance your experience.  Denying yourself the feeling really will elevate it, and maybe then his size won't matter as much.  Being too blunt might limit all of the above and kill his willingness to be truly intimate and have him limit sex to just getting in and out.  So be careful.  Good luck!!!|`|58oyBOueaa	I wouldn't say anything.  Just focus on the good.  How would you feel if he said "Baby, you're too loose and stretched out.

LGjavuykaa	WHY are you asking all these questions? We dress up because it makes us feel nice. I guess if a man grows balls he will not be whipped. Some signs of cheating could be her getting sneaky, or a change in her schedule, Dog House? I love when my boyfriend just looks at me. If a girl gets mad for that shes got problems so STAY AWAY! Yes parents have a huge influence on your relationships. Boy piss me of when they are immature and when they dont think before they speak/ If its your first relationship watch out for psychos. Make sure shes a nice girl.|`|cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	1.) Cuz girls love to wear beautifuls dresses and feel pretty. No girl ever thinks she is gorgeous, we always feel like we can fix soething to look better.<br>  <br>  2.) To get un-whipped, don't let her walk over you. Be nice and caring of course, but if she is being a "B" don't give in and do what she says, hold your ground. But be fair. FYI, wanting to spend time with your girl because you like her doesn't constitute you to being whipped.<br>  <br>  3.) If your kissing, sleeping or planning on doing those things with your X, your cheating.<br>  <br>  4.) Cards, candy or even simple things like a nice hot oil massage will get you outta the dog house. Show affection, tell them they are pretty, and just do all things you normally don't do. My BF will watch lifetime with me and give me a massage when I get mad at him and he is sorry. Or vise Versa.<br>  <br>  5.) Some girls get mad if you stare at us or just look, becuase some of us have low-self-esteem and we feel as though you are judging us and picking apart what we look like. For example, one might think its cuz she is ugly or fat. or some flat out just don't want you lookin at them<br>  <br>  6.) Yes, parents liking my BF is good. Easier to deal with.<br>  <br>  7.) No affection, but wants sex 24/7 makes me mad. Acting like a prick to their GF in front of their friends is another thing guys do that pisses off a girl. Not remember special occations or not being conforting is another thing.<br>  <br>  8.) If your the first BF, be nice and caring. Don't ruin her for others if it doesn't work out. Take things at the pace she is most confortable with. Some like to move fast, some don't. Just play it by ear and be yourself, thats why she is with you, cuz she likes who you are.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  Good luck! =)
cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Nah, I would let it go and stay friends. You will find someone way sexier and good to you.

zCJzy0Szaa	Talk about everything, It might be that she wants you to pick to make you happy. Ask her if you did this and that with the other girl would it be o.k.<br>  If she wants you to have sex or just oral and no kissing.<br>  Or just sex and nothing else. If she wants to just watch you two. <br>  You need to go through every possible situation. Ask her how the woman should look, Not one better looking than your wife. Get a magazine, not playboy, but one that she can look through and help you on what to look for.Just ask and talk........I am 22 and married so I hope it is good advice...|`|cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Usually, and I don't mean any offence, that is when a female gets bored and wants something different. My friend and her husband did, and they ended up splitting. So did my boyfriend and his ex-wife when they were married.<br>  <br>  Its fun when your not the one in the relationship. So many things can go wrong, for an example jealousy. She might ask afterwards, did you like her better than me? Or question why you picked a certain girl and ask you if you think she is better looking. It seems as though it opens a can of worms for certain couples. I've heard it all.<br>  <br>  I would tell her to find the girl, so that way it keeps you outta hot water just in case that is how she reacts. I'm sure there are willing females in your area, unless you have a mutual friend that will be willing. Another way would be the internet, like a singles sight, but be careful, you never know what that person might bring in, like an STD, not that they all do, but it is always possible.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope it works out.

I think alot of people feel intrinsically lonely deep down inside.|`|AA11097657	Even if you have a relationship & lots of friends it is still possible to feel very lonely inside.This is because no two people are the same. No one thinks like you do.What we think in our own head is as individual as a fingerprint.Our doughts,fears,happiness are all individual.The feeling of eternal lonelyness is very common.You will never for fill that gap in your life no matter who you meet or what you do.Live your life knowing that & you can stop searching for the answer.|`|AA11093708	i am too busy with my life to think about this. no i am not lonely - have ahubby and 3 children and friends and hobbies|`|2kmMm06Uaa	i dont care how much u have to do, when your lying in bed at night and you cant sleep thats when you start thinking. yeah  no matter how much i have to do or how much i have (a man , kids, what ever) there is that part that reminds me of what was that i dont have anymore. yeah that makes me feel lonely.|`|ITTOZVwWaa	i do|`|c5150a15762befec349b5ecce96379cfaa	how i pray this could be a myth.<br>  i thought i would never be lonely cos am working even after i decided to leave him.<br>  ts very painful to be lonely cos ts the heart which is suffering. i do get lonely however much busy i am, i still need someone to be with me.<br>  but...<br>  i will never go for someone who is untrue or not faithful or cannot be trusted as he was.would rather be lonely than die.

Thats shady that he would do that when you didn't even care, makes it seem like he is hiding something.

cd9640c258acd4d890168546358a5fe1aa	Start a normal conversation with him like you would normally do. Say hey, whats up? Ask him what he is doing for the weekend, if he says nothing ask if he wants to go do something with you sometime. No big deal, make it seem like a no big thing. It's less nerve racking ;-)<br>  Good luck sweetie

A meeting point where you or they (or both of you) are going to move to be together.  If neither is willing to do so then the relationship is doomed.<br>  <br>  Use the 'net, but occasionally send something "Snail-Mail."  Spray it with your signature scent so they can enjoy it :-)<br>  <br>  Have a good long-distance plan.  My BF and I have Cingular Nationwide with Mobile2Mobile.

How to get men to like them for them. I personally found out that if a man has no intrest in you romantically that you can't really change his mind. But if you're serious about this guy, ask him if he wants to hang out with you. Try to spend a little more time with him, but not too much other wise you're being overbering and that'll just push him away. So hang out a little more, show how great you can be. Don't be rude to the girl he seems to like because jealousy can be a turn off for most men.

You've cleared the air, you've told her exactly what you think and it gives her the opportunity to tell you how she feels.<br>  <br>  If she starts with the "aww" thing, then just say, "Look, I don't want any 'aww's'  I just want you to know how I feel and I would like to know if you feel the same way."  You've said what you need and stood you're ground.  If she thinks you're coming across as arrogant, then just tell her you don't mean to, you just want to say how you fell because you can't stop thinking this way about her.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps you, now I'm going to try it and see if it helps me...|`|10DjXLlWaa	If she has a boyfriend, better play it cool for a while. keep being friends with her, but let her make the first move to get with you.|`|AA10412863	tell her how you feel. if she really likes you she will break up with her bf and then you ask her out. if she is single one day ask her out. and if she likes you everything will fall into place. be confident!|`|YMAAUChbaa	Ask her out if you're not afraid of her.|`|b4645a4175582ba2174aa545e4232fd5aa	Find a new girl because if you are that much of a chicken i would hate to see how you are when her boyfriend finds you|`|fcf92f90cb9bace2ce8ea606d576dac3aa	if she has a boyfriend then just be the "best friend" figure untill she breaks up with him. then move in!|`|eLk5GU9Gaa	Well if she has a boyfriend..lay off. Thats pretty philty of you to want to even get kind of close w/ a girl that is taken. Not to be rude..im just telling you...bluntly!
10DjXLlWaa	Forget him! he obviously lied about loving you. Find someone else. This guy is a jerk.|`|A8weMRaPaa	I have no idea of your age or how experienced you are at dating. However, unfortunately that old adage rings true...some men use love to get sex and conversely women may use sex to get love.  This is never an honest or safe way to deal with anyone's emotions but it happens too frequently, I do not know if sex was an issue or even part of the equation in your relationship but do keep in mind that you should never be pressured or manipulated into doing anything that you don't sincerely and 'in your gut' know that it's right for you to do.<br>  <br>  Now for your question ... Love means so many things to so many different people. To you and most rational and reasonable people, to have been offered those words by someone you care about is a big step in a relationship. If after saying those words recently to you, he now wants to end the relationship -- obviously it meant something else to him. <br>  <br>  No one can control what another person thinks, feels, says or believes... nor can you change their mind, even when your heart feels like it's breaking. If he wants to end it, then it is ended. All you ever really control is how you respond to what affects you. Step back and look at the relationship before this occurred and my bet would be that there were indicators that the connection was not going to be a long lasting happily ever after. You can do much better, good luck.|`|TJRi971Caa	Drop him, lose him now. he lied u don't leave someone u love.He is obviously toying with your emotions. He should have been man enough 2 tell u y an than explain.
JiqUIXK7aa	Oh yes honey love is important and yes we do need to love someone that is not related to us and it's not a matter of choise u know it just happends . Love is that one thing that trully completes us.u can have all the love u need from your family and friends but u also need romantical love cause sometimes we get lonely if we dont have somebody who would give anything just to be with us, somebody who will love to grow old with us. so to cut a long story short yes we do need to love other people who are not related to us.|`|6232526885be6a6bc2fa0fda27c082b6aa	but yes it is!!!!!!!|`|db59518f6c77a253080327372987704caa	yup i know what you mean. after my past experiences I've tried to convince myself that i am self sufficient (which i am) and don't need somebody to love. actually, i need somebody to love me :P|`|88ab7acd2db2b055beb2d89557889f46aa	yes i know what u mean. it is perfectly already if u don't have a love of ur life. if u love ur friends and family and the in turn love u back there is no need to love someone else.<br>  and u r not weird if u don't Have  a boyfriend or a life partner|`|8uGHKjYlaa	Nope|`|iyCQR68naa	Love is important.. However love is not an adjective.. It is a verb. Love must be action oriented that is to say, the other person must FEEL your love.. not just the words, I LOVE YOU..|`|jKYgFwAeaa	I am afraid so....once you're in it, you can't function properly witout it.|`|qn03Bv35aa	Yes it is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
AA12102958	because we are idiots, lol. no really, we are, for most guys talking about how they feel is a sign of weakness, yes I know that is silly but what can you do. if you have an issue with a guy be very upfront and bold, if he responds in kindness and with honesty then great, if he pushes you away and acts dumb then he still has a lot of growing up to do.|`|5Thqmw41aa	Guys are created to be bold and adventurous. When they encounter an issue they would be too proud as to ask for help and would also snap at the idea of getting help.<br>  Hence prominent psychologists of the present day have commented that guys should not hold their feelings in as much as they do.|`|AA11345928	alrite, its rele stupid and i dont no how they got this idea in their head, but they think that ther the stronger sex. thet wont accept help from girls because they think wer the ones who always hav problems and that we dont no how to deal wit them. they dont want u to think that ther weak, or anyless manly. thats the most important thing to them and if they lose it they think they have nothing|`|CTircxLKaa	You know how when someone asks you if something is wrong and you say "im fine?" Chances are you aren't. When you ask a guy if something is wrong and thats what he says...believe him. He'll probably work out whatever it is on his own, just give it time and be patient.|`|e3ba1bb46f922e8d6e97f87b8c137b38aa	because us guys are just like that well some of us or sometimes we dont want to be with our girlfriends anymore.|`|kXzcRE3maa	because they feel like they can trust you more than anyone else you are the closet they have so they get mad at you for no reason.|`|lpYjWjCcaa	guys are very sensitive when it comes to relationships and stuff like that.|`|Aee8JOZHaa	we think we can help r selves.. not needing any1 else. sometimes true. but girls are used to girls always being there for each other. with guys thats not the case<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck.|`|N9pVRwkTaa	I don't think this is guy behavior.  I can't even guess what is going on in this one.  I would say somebody is a moody mess.  If a guy is a moody mess then go find someone stable.|`|Ct10iMlLaa	That could mean anything.|`|Kobxn4pYaa	Because we are idiots and want to be left alone sometimes....lol|`|bb79a9db2814bc5075a8ef16f77b4a00aa	my mom does that to my dad,it's not just men who do it,you women are guilty of doing that,when a man wants to help you you kick him and call him names and push him out.|`|kVm2pdxlaa	For the same reason girls do that stuff. Because we can.
6ILmH6kxaa	they like it rough|`|T1U4SzLtaa	She's warning you to be sure to wear a condom, because there's no telling what kind of disease she may give you.|`|O6xq7D49aa	It means this girls retarded|`|kXzcRE3maa	its just another teem as i like bad boys its the same thing.
10DjXLlWaa	yes, if you like him and she doesn't anymore, then he could be yours if you take him.|`|glXX7Dcfaa	No...Unless you are triflin.u never date a friends man/girl or ex.Its an unwritten rule.U just dont do **** like that
CtHuke7Paa	usually it's the same as when guys go showing off around girls, they want to impress you to make you like them more. sometimes though they just want to make you jealous, it depends on the situaton and the type of girl.|`|AA11598063	When a girl is trying to brag or show off to you, it means that she could be jealous because another female has something that she doesn't have, she's insecure, or she just wants attention. There's no need for a female to brag or show off. A woman should feel confident and comfortable in her own skin and not worry of what anyone thinks of her. She should also be proud and blessed of the things that she does have in her life.|`|378d3355d208d356d28028526f0606a5aa	It might mean that she kinda likes you or shes a bit jealous of you.|`|10DjXLlWaa	she is just trying to be something that you are. (Beautiful, nice, ect) she is jealous of you, so she is showing off.  I would ignore her, and maybe she will go away.|`|ef648f3fededa1b7315fd3547e11d46faa	maybe she is proud of what she has|`|pv8tpMY7aa	it means she's insecure|`|9RiBJfJCaa	That she all that better then any other girl you'll meet again,and times could mean she thinks that she better then you.|`|AA10145299	that she like you, duh!|`|cdd9L3uaaa	It means that in some way they are jelous of you|`|uaeSHzSLaa	Well..if i were to brag or show off..I whould only do it if i liked someone...she probably likes you.
a25b6a561e7647f76b3e3c5cebfffec0aa	That's a tough one... but what I would do is wait a little while then... you should ask him if he still is like Just friends with you or if he's more OK??? Talk later OK? bye!|`|YAlJgLpKaa	You should just be his friend. Maybe he does like you but dont you want him to ask you first. You dont wanna feel stupid if you try to get up with him and he only likes you as a friend. Let him make the first move. BUT THEIR IS NOTHING WRONG WITH FILIRTING THAT WILL MAKE HIM LIKE YOU EVEN MORE. And plus make him ask you out evening faster.|`|G3aU0ey8aa	U kno sometimes guys dont realize their flirting so they keep on doing it! and he probably said he's ur body guard as like a joke, and he probably just thinks of u as a frend! Maybe instead of coming on here and asking u should just ask him, I mean no one on here can read his mind!|`|ga4FI5QSaa	Well he sounds interested.  Do be careful though.  Since he has a girlfriend, he may just be looking for a flirty female friend.  You could ask him if he is happy in his relationship.  That should send him signals and also give you some piece of mind as to what exactly he's looking for.|`|jjOpTUMRaa	well, if hes got a girlfriend, you should keep a little distance between the two. you dont want his girlfriend on your back starting stuff. just play it cool and find out if he really does like you. if so, let him make the decision of either just being friends or "trying someone new". if he says he doesnt, its his loss that he missed out on a great person.<br>  <br>  good luck! :]
NwLRGAQqaa	Make lots of eye contact, smile and touch him on the arms, chest etc. Use your body language girl!!|`|AA11296040	u need to talk to  your friend first and foremost!<br>  <br>  Remember that friends stay when guys go away...<br>  but if you push them away while you have a guy you may never get them back...|`|2545e155e303c5adba6838fc91624d3caa	oh, same here with the best friend thing.. I hate it.. im like well.. I been liking him for 2 months now and ERR it gets me mad..

vroC2yXAaa	Go out with me...|`|1aada54006b908931a8ecfb651c27b8baa	First off, your not in love. You are infatuated (there is a difference). Second, the boy only wants one thing, I know, I was that age once....we all want that one thing.  Don't sweat it, you will have plenty of time to date when you get a bit older.|`|MFlHrJ8jaa	how old are you|`|d2XVTG9xaa	Why are you ashamed? If you really love him like you say you do, you wouldn't be ashamed to tell your parents about him.|`|Um5aQvcJaa	You've never stated your age.Telling it to your parents may not be the wise option.They might get upset.Don't you have sense of adventure?You're parents may object the very idea but go and date the guy,anyway!|`|91doquW8aa	First, how old are you??|`|mY0CvaaQaa	what wud be the reason why ur parent don't like ur bf? with this, we can't answer ur query.
b493caa427317263d70ed82e7d49512eaa	You really can't make him realize anything.  He is the one to make that decision.  I think the relationship means more to you than it means to him so that's why it's so easy for him to walk away.  He has to make the decision if it's worth losing you or not.  If you've already talked to him and he knows how you feel, I think the rest is left up to him.  You'll just have to accept the relationship for what it is, or move on from him completely and find a new friend.  Seeing him treat you like this will just make you more miserable.  I think you have a better chance at finding a new friend, but still keep in touch with him.  It doesn't appear there is anymore that you can say or do to make him realize that you are a good friend.  He has to see that for himself and if he doesn't see it, then maybe he's not that good of a friend afterall.  You've done what you can do....you can't make someone want to be with you so I think your work here is done.|`|AA12247182	i can understan well........so Now it's ur turn......Follow the steaps.<br>  <br>  Just go for him with a" SAd Face " and start talk to him in a " Low voice" that if u didn't able to get him your life is kind of over. I'm in Love with u and i don't want lost u. If u don't Love me then Please never leave me alone be my Buddy 4 ever. i'm baging u please.<br>  <br>  (don't talk in loud keep ur voice low)<br>   <br>  And then hold his hand and say him to promise with u he'll never leave u alone. And look in his eyes.with a very Sad Face.<br>  <br>  it can really help u......I know it's hard but u have to do that for safe ur Friendship.
7joaYotoaa	Oh my! I have this one friend, all she does is talk about herself. All day I hear "so and so thinks im hot" and "oh my goodness I think____likes me" blah blah blah! It was so annoying! One day a snaped and ended up yelling at her. Now she doesnt talk about herself AS MUCH. Now im not telling you to go out and yell at your friend, but maybe you should sit down and talk to them about whats bothering you. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|bNdMR66Paa	Well, its a friend, let them know that sometimes they do things that get on your nerves.  All friends go thru that.  Just be honest, if they are  a true friend they will understand.|`|358b881e4ed1cbfe513d7fff953d25dbaa	Fren is some1 who can share ur ups & dwns. Wat's matter her? Try send her a greeting msg to make her day ya..=)|`|Y55ktW6Faa	If your friend is truly your friend then anything your friend does shouldnt be anoying. its your friend, so what if he or she seems anoying, they wouldnt be your friend then right|`|jc1aXXbXaa	ignore her LOL
10DjXLlWaa	You should have all ready done something!!!!!!!!!!!!!! report it now; not later, not tomorrow; NOW!!!!!!!! call the police, or child welfare and report it. find the hotline for sexual abuse, online.<br>  <br>  sexual abuse hotline.com|`|i2gS4vTJaa	Tell someone ...NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|rM9RmlIyaa	That's pretty hard to deal with. Things like that are so hard to do seomthing about. You just have to gather up the courage to tell a person you trust. The best choice would be to tell an adult in the family, or if they don't believe you, or don't do anything about it, bring it to the police. It's hard to deal with but something has to be done.
f252bf5ac4507d1417e332c70e950edbaa	Talk to her...it sounds like you guys have just drifted apart. Sometimes you have to confront each other to keep a good relationship...you can be friends with the other person too.|`|AA12247182	Just go for he/she and tell her that u r really intersted to be his/her Best Buddy........and let's see wt's happend.......BEST of LUCK.|`|AA10788358	Ask her: Why are you ignoring me?<br>  <br>  Talk it out. If you feel she's not that good of a friend anymore, hang out with that new friend.|`|AA11831178	How can you call each other best friends if you act this way towards each other? Maybe it's time to talk to one another about your frienship.
AA12247182	sometimes you just feel tired.<br>  You feel weak and when you feel weak you feel like you wanna just give up.<br>  But you gotta search within you, you gotta find that inner strength<br>  and just pull that quit out of you and get that motivation to not give up<br>  and not be a quitter, no matter how bad you just fall flat on your face.|`|fu8fA29kaa	I know exactly how you feel, but I think you need to hang on in there.  There is not a lot in this life you can't come back from.  Last year I/ had a terrible year and I/ had my confidence shattered, but I figured the best thing to do is to pick myself up and take control of my life.  Life goes in swings and roundabouts and you just have to stay on until the ride is over.  I hope that this helps and if you want to chat further let me know|`|WYdgy0s9aa	think about all the good things yu can do and regain confidence in yoself. DONT LET NOONE CHANGE YU AND LOWER YO SELF-ESTEEM. YU ARE WHO YU ARE AND YU SHOULD BE PROUD THT YU ARE DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS. and all the bad times should teach yu a lesson so think positive.

ca6a00d2d47dbe37091dc38d28a3599faa	i agree w/ u.  but i dont see the question sry.|`|AA11809783	Do not ruin your friendship over this. She has only had the boyfriend for a little while you guys have been friends for a while. There should be room enough in her heart for you. And remember she will always come to you for advice she can not get from her boyfriend! God bless you and good luck!|`|0cff23fbe37382f045df04fd89d828c2aa	When people are caught up in a new relationship sometimes they forget that there are other people affected by that new equation too.  If she's not spending as much time with you, let her know that you miss her company.  Plan a girl's night in or out in advance, so that she's not making plans with the new squeeze and is committed to eating junk food, watching bad movies, and painting nails just like old times.  <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to be supportive of her new relationship.  Even if you're not crazy about Mr. Right Now, try to be as positive about the two of them around her.  Cutting him down, or acting jealous will simply drive her away.  If she's a good friend, she'll understand when you talk to her about missing your time together, and make an effort to find the time.|`|668fbf464e1ad265fca7765a2ddb543faa	Sorry that you feel left about by your friend. Sometimes it can be hard when a friend drifts away from you...and for a boyfriend. I think that if you do not feel appreciated by your friend then you need to say something. If she is a good friend then she will sympathise with you. But I also think that you need to understand that your friend is trying to cement and make foundations in her new relationship, and that often takes time. So please don't feel left out, she will need you whether things do or don't work out with her new man!<br>  Take Care xx|`|AA12247182	i know dued.....that's happend sometime.......cus after they get a bf/gf they just spend their more time with them......rather then us.........but don't worry when they'll get broke-up ur the one they'll come back give u Huge and start cry...........so just take it easy......|`|KKM30meVaa	yeah, if this person was really your friend they wouldn't put a bf in front of U.|`|AA11311356	yeah friends are pains when they get boyfs..<br>  <br>  step back..let their first few weeks together be like they should be.. let it calm down a bit..<br>  <br>  tell her tht you miss seeing her so often..can u work something out... you and her time....<br>  <br>  x|`|Spw2eUwUaa	I can understand how ur feeling thats bcoz most of my friends have boy friend and I dont have a boy friend and I really get irritated when they talk to their boy friends for hours when they r with me like in a restaurent. I did not tell them till now  that it irritates me but I did show them that I dont like it, I asked them many a times to end the conversation and talk to me but they dont do it usually.<br>  But I have decided if next time they do like that I will tell them clearly that I dont like it and do not talk to their boy friends when I am with them.<br>  I suggest u to do the same thing. Talk to her but be sure she does not take u wrong she can even think like ur jealous bcoz she is having a nice boy friend.<br>  So think and decide carefully what are you gonna talk to her.<br>  But yes ur right, good friend sometimes really a pain.|`|WaeQnNQOaa	Well yes just tell her the truth and say you dont like her ignoring you like that.....|`|chrqyHyvaa	Your friend has someone new in her life and can't devote all of her time to you anymore. You have to "give up" a little bit of her. But I understand what you are saying. Talk to her and let her know how you feel. You and your friend should make plans to hang sometimes, but you should also allow her some time to spend with her boyfriend.  If she is truely your friend, she will understand how you feel.  You will have a boyfriend one day and you will want to spend time with him too. You won't have as much time for her as you did before. You can remain friends and still find time for each other. Friendship will always find a way. Good Luck. I hope this helps you out!|`|kHxjUXe6aa	Very sorry about you’re friend, but all women are the same they use each other, once they get a boy friend they don’t want to know there friends, she be running back when they split up trust me.|`|qugUD6bMaa	ok make plans w/ur friend like a sleep over and talk about hanging out w/each other|`|vvSsCtxbaa	SOMETIMES GOOD FRIENDS R HARD TO FIND OBVIOUS UR FRIEND HAS TO GROW UP A LITTLE......SHE WILL COME AROUND WHEN SHE COMES DOWN FROM THE CLOUDS...CHIN UP!
AA12247182	Try to explain ur Friend that nothing is like that u guys see each other as a friend just make her belive like that..........when she belive she'll let u go......BEST of LUCk>|`|83PON9Ziaa	If you're having second thoughts, then that's your conscience telling you "don't do it". Obviously you feel your friend wouldn't be comfortable with that. If the two of you didn't already have an understanding and she said it was ok, then you shouldn't have asked Josh. I personally wouldn't do that even if I didn't have feelings for the guy and we're just friends. Just think if the tables were turned, how would you feel?|`|Nt7eLOY6aa	If she's a true friend, tell her, and respect her wishes. Boyfriends and girlfriends are easy to come by, but true friends are not.
AA11363175	I used to be that way too and now I have a friend who is just like yours. It takes time for people to overcome shyness, some never do. If your friend finds it hard to socialise, encourage her to mingle around with other people more, make your other friends into her mutual friends, especially if they're a different circle of friends she isn't familiar with. Maybe she can slowly open up to them. I moved schools in high school and vowed to make a complete change and a new environment helped me a whole lot because I could pretend not to be as shy as I really was and over time I abandoned my comfort zone.<br>  <br>  If her shyness is causing problems to herself, maybe restricting her from expressing herself better to other people, always tell her that it is all right to speak up for herself. Give her the chance to speak when she needs to. She has to learn to break out of it if she wants to, all in her own time. And if she is afraid of what other people would think of her if she tells them her feelings, assure her that sometimes people would also like to know that someone wants to get to know them. It's a two way thing.|`|qD3OqXhGaa	Some of us are just made to be able to write better than we can speak...that may never change for her. You can help her become more assertive though. You could role play with her, so she gets the feel of speaking out. Remember not everything always has to be said though. Sometimes that can create a bigger problem. If she can deal with some things, work them through without confrontation then she is a big person, and that is somewhat of a gift!<br>  <br>  It is important that if she is going to voice negative things that she balance them with positive...if possible.|`|9c4d762a189c8f036cb003f2f0bc731caa	If she wants to talk, then she'll talk. Otherwise, let her be. You may feel sorry for her but shyness is just a part of her personality. If she wants to change then she will but don't try to change her.|`|SNVt0fypaa	hmm..?if i had a friend that did that i would probably be like its either you speak your mind or dont talk at all..let her know that its ok to speak her mind..people will actually look at her differently and like her more.
D6BdfxBiaa	You should just ask him yourself. It's the only sure fire way that you'll know for certain. Who knows? Maybe he will. Maybe he won't, but at least you'll know.  As for your friends, you should make them do a solemn swear to never tell. But even then, I wouldn't trust them. The best way to get a secret out of your system is to dig a small hole in the ground and whisper your secret in there, and then bury it. Try suggesting that to them. It might work.|`|Mrcc51mfaa	WOW!!!!! I AM ONLY 10 YEARS OLD AND I DONT DATE AND DONT DO RELATIONSHIPS I AM NOT DOING IT WHEN I AM A TENNAGER BUT JUST DONT ASK HIM OUT SO WHAT IF YOU THINK HE LIKES YOU|`|SNVt0fypaa	Well..I think you should be straight forward and grab him to the side and if you like him then tell him you look at him more as a friend and ask him if he can see you two being more as friends..if he says yes then take it to the next level..if not then move on...but by what you tell me i think hell say he likes you..hes probably just shy and he probably said no because you said no.thats how boys are

You can try talking to your friend and explain how you feel, and give her examples of why you feel he/she has abandoned you.  That may help, but as I said, most likely this friend has moved on to another level and in order to keep up, you will have to be the one in the relationship who makes the changes to accommodate him/her.  Your only other choice is to move on and put that person out of your mind and your thoughts. That's not easy either, so good luck.

And as far as you telling her that you knew that she took it and her denying it......even if she did take it she wouldnt be dumb enough to tell you. If I were you, I wouldnt worry about it.......What goes around comes around 10 times worse.

CyH4DO0qaa	It doesn't sound as if you're nice to everyone so much as you are polite and afraid to stand up for yourself. There is a difference. <br>  <br>  Tell the girl you don't have to put up with abuse and that if she can't stop it, you'll have to stop being her friend.|`|BwzcEQcRaa	find a new friend|`|MoRqxMVHaa	Hit her back.|`|5bdcd6fdade97ea18590869df8c0bcc0aa	hit her back. Or she might want more of ur attention. Being short, being african american and having acne and scars is not the reason to hate people. It's a sorry thing to note that these are the basis of being liked in your schools. Gross. Talk to her and clear everything|`|6f3f57540dd14c18fc9455e76b075c88aa	tell your school counselor<br>  <br>  and if it doesnt work, take your fattest text book and smack it her upside her head|`|AA11119626	Let's start with your definition of the word, "friend." It's important that you figure out just what that word means to you, because what you think about this will drive all of your relationships. Ask yourself what you expect to bring to a friendship, and what you need/want to get out of it.<br>  <br>  The reason I say this is that someone who hits you, pokes you, and pulls your hair, especially after you've asked her to stop, is hardly what I'd call a friend.  Right now, your relationship is more "abuser/abused" than friendship. <br>  <br>  If you want more of the same, then just keep letting her do it and stop complaining, because you've chosen to allow her to abuse you. <br>  <br>  The way you get it to stop is you say, loudly, "I asked you to stop doing that, now STOP!" Then walk away. Don't reward the bad behavior. If she's polite to you, then you talk to her. If she abuses you, you leave, immediately and ignore her until she is behaving.<br>  <br>  Right now, she does it because the behavior is paying off - you're letting her do it, and continuing to talk to her. You aren't doing her any favors by allowing her to abuse you - she's not learning to control herself. None of this has anything to do with the color of her skin or her height or acne. Would you enjoy it if a short white person hit you and pulled your hair? Let's not confuse the issues, here.<br>  <br>  Now, let's talk about the rest of this post. Nobody likes her because she's short, has bad skin, and is African-American? Oooh, that does NOT say good things about the people where you are. Ouch. They're shallow and racist?  How are other short people, or African-American people, treated where you are? Is it possible people don't like this girl because she is rude and abusive? <br>  <br>  You might want to examine your own thoughts about those things, while you're thinking about all of this. <br>  <br>  Maybe she can learn to treat people, especially you, better. If not, you don't have a duty to allow her to abuse you, and if you don't learn to politely, but firmly, stand up for yourself, this girl isn't the only one who'll take advantage of you.|`|c3fb34d2d6fa7de31b3dd0a86f7db0bbaa	hit her @$s back and stop talking to her. she's not your friend. what does the acne or her race have to do with it though?<br>  <br>  get a backbone and stand up for yourself|`|2hDIQycUaa	you said nobody really likes her, well that could be whats wrong, maybe she is doing it to get attention. maybe give her a little extra attention and see if maybe that helps in the way she treats you. i had a friend who would aggravate me to no end and i realized that all she wanted was just a little more attention from me because she had no other friends. so maybe she is just craving attention.|`|3a11b3743f05b1151c5d1ee0a77776a4aa	tell her that you don't like what she does n if she doesn't stop u r gonna ditch her n then she'll hv no frnd|`|AA12247182	If she treat u like this u should just leave her alone.....i know it's hard......but u have to....cus it can really hurt u.....if you want leave her alone....then just stop talking to her....start ignore her.....stop helping her....and let her live her own life....<br>  <br>  But make sure u don't hit her back.....cus if u hit her back then nothing will deffrent between you both.......so just let her go. Don't worry about her.|`|SvkJkmeHaa	I would back away from the friendship for awhile and let her realize what a friend you are.  hopefully if she thinks anything of your friendship she will realize what she is doing isn't right and want to stop.  Then you could resume your friendship.

4caee8e43b90197b99afb5288315a066aa	Yo pienso que no te debes enfocar a que subiste de peso, ya que eso es algo momentaneo, te puedes recuperar en unos meses y no va a haber problema, no te preocupes, eso pasara.<br>  Lo que creo que estan en unmomento de ajuste a una nueva vida, es normal que el apetito sexual se estanque por el momento ya que tu subiste de peso y no te sientes tan linda como para gustarle y no puedes ser igual en la cama. Pero sobre todo la llegada del BB hace que esten cansados, que tengan otras cosas en la mente y a lo mejor estan muy estresados.<br>  Dale tiempo, no presiones y sientete tan hermosa como siempre has sido para el, no resaltes tus defectos, eso hace que el cambie tambien. <br>  Disfruten esta nueva etapa juntos y si sientes que es muy importante recuperar tu figura para recuperar tu autoestima.... disponte una dieta segura para el BB y para ti (podrias perder la leche si no es bien equilibrada) y solo relajate, arreglate todos los dias para que te vea muy linda y ya.<br>  El sexo a veces es muy frecuente y a veces no lo es tanto. No te preocupes y disfruten este nuevo momento.<br>  Suerte y recuerda que tu eres taaaan hermosa como tu misma lo creas.

fBdtvrWdaa	I believe I just answered one of your questions? Maybe not? Anyway, spoiled just makes you a brat- the way you hold yourself and conduct yourself can make you a slut. If you flirt with every guy and constantly talk about how "hott" you are, you are probably a slut...|`|3gozvB3Vaa	If you get a bf your probably pretty slutty.
637pZC5Eaa	well my first advice is dont have sex while your still in high school.... but ur not gonna listen lol... so it's trial and error when you guys do anything just watch his facial expressions and other.... signs.... eventually you'll get a feel for what is right.... be careful though...|`|4HoVVCenaa	Let him take the lead. But, honestly, don't be in a hurry. Wait until you are older, not for religious reasons, but because you will wish you had when you are older.|`|tjeVygG5aa	honestly you should probably wait. Dont just do it because he has had sex before. When the both of you are ready then you will be ready, it's not supposed to be planned for the first time unless you're on your honey moon. second of all, during your first time make sure he knows that you're doing something you've never done before and to take it slow. dont be worried about turing him on. If he wants to be with you in that way to be with you and not just to have sex with you then no matter what you do he'll be fine with it. And if its something you decide to do, and you decide to do it again, over time you will get more comfortable and thats when you should be wondering what you can do to please him even more.    As far as touching and what not you'll know what to do when you're in the moment. Some people like grabbing, playing with hair, scratching or digging nails into the back, but like I said that will come when you feel more comfortable. Good luck, and like everyone else said be safe, not only with your body but your heart as well.|`|xEDnhoI2aa	well there is a lot of excitement at having sex but i do take it you have done other things with him already..you will know what to do when the time comes the touching and movement will come when things get going....trust me you will know what to do cause your body will be doing them with out you knowing it..good luck be safe.
iFsIAc3vaa	honestly. Keep doing what your doing. i kno it sux but you have to wait and play things by ear. it will become obvious if he begins to like you more then just a friend. Does he initiate conversations? Does he call you? what do you talk about. Become his friend as you are doing and things will happen in time if they are ment to. Best of luck|`|AA11483933	Hmm... just ask him to go with you to watch a movie that's coming out or ask him to hang out at a place that is popular in your town, city, etc. Talk to him like you would talk to him online and just think of him as a friend for now. Be comfortable.. it's okay if you are nervous because I was when I talked to my crush.. but I'm sure he would be nervous too so don't worry. Go for it!|`|mzEVBlozaa	Sounds sort of complicated but if your best friend says it's okay and she REALLY means it, you can go for it. If you've got other girl friends with boyfriends you can all go on a group date to get to know him in a casual environment (most of the time, formal ones freak them out). After that, try something else, like taking a walk in a park together or doing some sort of activity together. Ask him open-ended questions like what kinds of music (and artists, particularly), movies, and what his hobbies are. Don't rush anything, so you won't scare him away. Don't be afraid of rejection. The worst thing he can say to you asking him out is "no." Seventeen magazines are helpful. So does Cosmopolitan but it gets raunchy. Don't let him pressure you into anything you don't want to do just to make him like you. As the saying goes, "Why buy the cow if you can have the milk for free?" Most guys like a little bit of a chase; they're competitive creatures by nature. Good luck and I hope this helps!|`|jBxW6ee9aa	I am 18 and never had a boy friend, so your not alone!! I think you should tell him how you feel. If he doesn't feel the same way then continue to be friends. Who knows, maybe he'll want to be more sometime to. Hope this helps.|`|fBdtvrWdaa	First of all, your friend probably isn't ok with it, but assuming that she is, I would ask for his phone number. Start having some phone conversations with him and then after a while, suggest hanging out and let things progress from there. Start small :)|`|LS8LcuRaaa	start flirting with him.|`|m3H1A4W1aa	Just suggest as a friend you meet up sometime maybe the cinema and then take it from there|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	You already have conquered two barriers.  1 - your friends feelings.  2- getting in contact with him.    If you chat again with him - ask if he would like to get together for some event (social gathering, church event, something with people around so he will not feel pressured). That way you can talk, and you can see how he acts, and decide if you want to go on.    If this is a success, then a week or two later, ask for going for a drink (or pray he`ll ask you) together to a popular place.    Just build on that - and take it one step at a time. (so don`t ask him to marry you on the second date.. that really is too soon)|`|EkLJDcc7aa	Maybe take him to a movie some time with other friends.  A movie that you would still be interested in.  Or maybe go do something with friends that hes interested in, that you still good at.  My friend had the same issue, and now their like great friends, when last month they barely even talked.  What she did was get his number and text him like once every other day.  If he doesnt keep texting, text you back, or even answer, maybe he just isnt interested.|`|OQF6x5CDaa	just go nice n easy.  dont rush things.  build a friendship.  hes ALREADY noticed you.  dont get all flirty!!  big turnoff.|`|z73Edt0haa	just in a way that makes you comfortable tell him how you are feeling

ac8802ee4683df91d0489f235cc3e928aa	IT IS ' UNCONDITIONAL"  REMEMBER U HAVE TO WORK AT REAL LOVE . IF U DONT THEN IT IS NOT REAL. U HAVE TO TAKE THE GOOD WITH THE BAD. IT TAKES 2 TO LOVE.     GOOD LUCK|`|AA11933435	What is 'real' Love??? Wow... philosophers and poets have been trying to answer that question for thousands of years, and there is no short and easy answer to that one.  Love, unfortunately... is notably complex.  There's little question of that.  But... many agree that 'love' as a word, expression, or feeling, cannot stand alone.  For love to be complete and to work, it requires a great many things.  And yes, my reply here is long, but love... is not so simple a thing.  This is a fact that cannot be denied.<br>  <br>  Most tend to agree, that for love to work, and to be real and true, it must have what is alternately known as fidelity, faithfullness, loyalty, or devotion, all words that mean pretty much the same thing.  But there's more... that makes love real and true.<br>  <br>  Very importantly, love requires communication.  The importance of communication cannot be stressed strongly enough.  Love often fails, and quite unnecessarily, simple because of a lack of good open communication.  Lovers... should be able to talk about positively anything and everything, at any time, and with a real respect for the feelings and views of one's love.  And yes, it's very important to actually listen, and to ask questions, camly, when something isn't understood.  Understanding, empathy, kindness, compassion, and flexibility... are very important.  Lovers must be very able and very willing to accommodate one another, and it must be completely mutual.<br>  <br>  To love... means to express genuine companionship, to develop a real and deep actual friendship, and to provide a goodly portion of sweet personal attention as needed, and there must be generosity or unselfishness, and a respectable level of real trust and honesty.  Trust and honesty are essential, and both must provide this in considerable proper measure.  And the total reduction of petty jealousies is important, as is learning to not allow the 'little things' to become a big problem.  And love cannot persist if one or both in a relationship is unreasonabe, inflexible, or overly demanding.  Love positively requires a lot of adjustment and compromises.  It also requires a true measure of mutual respect.  Respect... is important.<br>  <br>  Love requires giving of one's self to the full, holding, and being there for one's love in the best of times and the worst of times.  Love... takes strength, dedication and uncommon patience.  Love... means to feel joy, with the one you hold so dear, and it's very important that it's indeed deeply mutual :-)<br>  <br>  And of course... what happens in the bedroom (or wherever) must be good, enthusiastic, and mutual.  And I address the subject of sex, only because it's impossible to overstate its real importance, and it should not be ignored.  It can't be.  When it comes to sex, it shouldn't be permitted to become bland or routine.  Sex, while in love, is the very best kind.  Nothing equals it.  Nothing.  And being sexually compatible is important, and the there must be real respect for one's partner's sexual needs, feelings, and... limitations.  Love does not permit for the forcing of someone to do something sexually, that they truly do not want to do.  That is unreasonable and unfair.  Love means caring about the actual sexual confort of one's loving partner.  And this doesn't mean that one shouldn't be flexible and accommodating, but obviously we all have certain limits, and there's little doubt about that.<br>  <br>  The last thing I want to mention, which is the cause of love failing, commonly bringing a very sad end to many otherwise good relationships, is the acts and actions that attempt, for whatever reason, to force major 'changes' in the person that one loves, with the hope of molding and shaping them into what one wishes them to be.  If you feel that you have to coerce or persistantly demand big or numerous changes in your lover's behaviors, habits, personality, character, moods, spirit, religion, politics, or any other major aspect of their being... then one are destined to fail, and miserably.  People cannot be changed so radically, and they will resist such changes, fight them, and eventually such attempts will lead to a split, and usually a loud, unpleasant, hurtful... or even a dangerous one, with some.  Ultimately, if the person isn't what you wanted them to be in the first place, then quite simply... you chose the wrong partner, and you should have kept searching, until you've found the person with the qualities that you want in a person as a lover and a mate.  And note that very likely, the 'perfect' mate simply doesn't exist.  Such is usually the stuff of dreams and fantasies, so, personally I suggest that one finds the best person for them that they can, then learn to accept the little things that arent 'perfect', an acceptance which itself is born of love- that tolerance of those things that are... just as they are... and likely always will be :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich|`|AA11286497	i believe its pure devotion, and the desire to be with the other.|`|ySroZiRRaa	Real love is someone that will love you for who you are and who your becoming. Real love is someone who admires you, inspires and helps you grow into a better person.Their never selfish, or ashamed.

A confident woman is actually sexy.  She carries herself well, and she does not need a man to take care of her.  She is happy with herself, so she will not stress or stress her man out because she can do it on her own.  bd|`|AA11933435	No, not as long as ' I ' have every confidence... that she loves me :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jon|`|EvFvqe7Naa	No, well, unless she has a weapon.|`|dvp4hBusaa	Nope no reason to.|`|4d883eb1d459d9a7c1781bd0b7e5da0aaa	no, but a cocky one would be kinda threatening.|`|AA11286497	sure, sometimes, a confident woman is more likely to kick the guy to the side, who can't keep up with her and find someone that can.|`|QBNydd7naa	no i like to interact with confident women i like the fact she who she wants to be and nothing will put her down|`|f6B5c49Vaa	No.  She knows what she wants.. I like that|`|zrjlbsXKaa	No.  I really like a confident woman.  I was raised around a lot of really successful confident women.  My mother is kind of a workaholic, and very successful at what she does.  And both of my sisters were High School valedictorians; and one of them was College valedictorian.  So I'm really accustomed to high-powered, confident women.<br>  <br>  In fact, weak women who have no confidence annoy me kind of.
4m9Hewq1aa	YES! This is the situation I am currently in with my friend. I fell for him years ago and I wish he would ask me out...I'm afraid to ruin our friendship though. As the girl in this situation I can honestly say take a chance---she may feel the same way about you! -Alice|`|pQBjqMkoaa	depends on if i liked him|`|EeBpGOQPaa	Yes. whether girls like to admit it or not, we all think about being more than just friends with the guy. Especially if he's cute!

I "earned" diamonds , but not by cooking.|`|wGw834Gkaa	Wives and husbands should get with the 21st century and stop having this attitude.  We aren't subservient anymore, God help you if you try this on someone.|`|3e657243a606e14632ec806cc8f3adf1aa	Nah you should just be glad she felt like cooking.  You need to take her out when she doesnt want to cook, at least 5 times a week.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Cute.  And when guys close the seat, pick up after themselves, do their own laundry, ironing, and cooking...they should get sex points.   :)  Sounds dumb to me.   Whatever floats your boat...|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	HAHA. funny. should husband get obedient points when they actually fix something (as opposed to making it worse) and lift a finger to clean up the house? they could "cash" in these points for sex with something besides their hand.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	That sounds great! And we could give them to husbands for Good performances in the bedroom, hmmm, no then we'd have to admit that we're actually faking it so you'll hurry up and get off of us so we can go watch the nightly news.|`|BItkg1f0aa	LMAO! thats funny...ahhh, thanks for the laugh|`|egqveuPjaa	Ohhh! That is such a good idea!! It's a win/win situation really....|`|HRIbmp67aa	screw the damn points!!!  that shyt is supposed to happen anyway!|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Sure, why not?|`|a68665ef6c4434c025138a75281114eeaa	LMAO!  now put on your big-boy pants and go straight to your naughty chair for a 6 minute time-out.  :)|`|2Xw4Tm0Taa	Sure - if you're in a 3rd world country and your wife is in elementary school.|`|PMtqTW6qaa	jesus didn't see you coming did he?|`|240SYAuiaa	Yes.  I like the way your mind works.|`|o0hUphynaa	what do you mean by "obedient"?  She's not a dog.  I believe in treating someone when they are doing well, but you cant use that as leverage to get your way.|`|9ebe04169d04d9c952a946440b3ad139aa	Oh God, in that case, I'd have no points at all. Obedience is not one of my strong points. Neither is cooking, unfortunately.|`|KadJyjtBaa	Women are not some kind of thing you give points to for been your dummy. Not all men would reward their wives the way they are meant to be rewarded. Women work hard to take care of the home and be treated with respect. Not to be rewarded for how "obedient" and cooking dinner. This question is the most ignorant question i have heard and its wrong and absurd. Their are men who cook and clean too. Its not only women... get with the program.|`|tXSmJDr0aa	You sound like an asshole anyway, so you probably will never have to worry about this.|`|i15KoiJhaa	No, no...    See being obedient and getting rewarded for that is for Dogs.    I have a Chocolate Lab and we reward him for sitting, speaking, getting the ball... "Who's a good boy? Who's good?!"     Dang he loves those "Begging Strips" !    I do things for my Husband because I love him and he does for me because he loves me... If there ever came a day when my Husband thought a reward or a demerit could be given to me for not cooking his dang dinner... that would be the day that me and my Lab are going to need to find other accommodations.|`|dprURFLxaa	You know what's funny about this...my friend used a point system with her fiance so he could earn BJ's.  Seriously.  He would earn points for various things he did that were 'good' and after he earned x amount of points he could cash them in for a BJ.  Freakin hilarious.  All you need to go with it is a sticker chart.  LOL.|`|2rjwntWbaa	obedient? like a dog? maybe you need to relocate to the Middle East. you could make her wear a big black cloak as well.|`|Qmz91rhKaa	Oh yes
AA10456284	grrr, I hate that!!! i don't know what is wrong with old guys that they think it's ok to so blatantly check out and comment on young women, as if they had a chance. It grosses me out. maybe they figure since they're old, they don't have to be discreet, or they have nothing to lose. Some people say you should be flattered when an older guy hits on you, because they have "experience" and have seen a lot of women in their lives,but I think it's just creepy....hello, would they want their friends hitting on their granddaughter? Don't punch 'em tho, just ignore them, or say something snappy so they feel stupid and get embarrassed. e.g "Sorry, I don't do wrinkled d****",; "isn't it time you went home to change your Depends?" or "even if you were fifty years younger, you wouldn't have a chance!". Now, some people would say that doing that is mean, but I say, if you're going to make someone uncomfortable by looking at them as a sex object when you don't even know them, you get what you deserve ;)|`|a06e6a75eb1170fa0a0c07d6007bfaa8aa	Because you ugly?|`|t0KAgdqpaa	Catch one off guard and ask what he's looking at. Easier than violence. lol.

I bet you were an annoyance to someone for some reason when you were 12 so cut her some slack.  You are only there a couple of hours so its not too much to bear.  She will out grow this soon and I bet you will then miss the attention.  Takepleasure that for a little while you are the light of someones life and be kind to her.|`|l1Hjw2U5aa	She admires you!!! don't you remember when you were young you did that! lol

But your question doesn't make sense because it says "boyfriend or not?" well even if he does like you that does not automatically make him your boyfriend...so I would say that your friend is just jealous but he is not your boyfriend.|`|58kkmNWHaa	OMG!!!!I like this guy named Nick.He does the exact thing to me!My friend said the same thing.My friends name is Jessica!I think you two are friends!Get closer and talk to him more over the phone and during school!Ask him out!Ask him once you get into a great conversation.Ok.I hope this helps your question.Have a nice day!!<br>  <br>  ~~Ashley~~|`|cf9d7a4fc1fb2659abd7a7ad86d605ceaa	He "smiled" at you!

mhxZWtSFaa	well why not look at it as unusual sex experience!! but u have to be ready for it, it hurt kinda at first, and he should use lube a lot of it!! lol|`|8DsbSALzaa	Respect his idea if u like him , give him a pleasure of being urs|`|dCmSA6r2aa	tell him yes or no and don't change it  if you don't want to if he cares for you he will leave it alone  some think it is great others think it is nothing more then pain  if you are curious try your fingers with a lot of lube to see how it feels for you  if he hasn't done it before he will probably hurt you because he doesn't know what he is doing  it is definitely easier on you if you are very excited and if you don't really want to do it it increases the chance of it hurting you  if you do it remember lots of lube fingers first to loosen you up and he must take it slow to allow you to stretch  if you are into it and he does it right it can be mind blowing  if he doesn't know what he is doing its like trying to shove a watermelon through a knot hole in the fence|`|JNTiteXmaa	The next time he brings it up, just tell him how you feel. Whether you're scared or just think it's gross, you have to voice your concerns. How else is he supposed to know? Sexual dialogue is super important in relationships. You're not always going to be totally into everything he is- a fact of life, and if you want to spend it with him, you need to learn to deal with it.|`|Zl3re1Vhaa	If you are uncomfortable tell him so and if he cares about you he'll let it go some women like the sensation but some do not but you should never feel pressured to do anything sexually that you aren't ready for|`|068LIR7eaa	tell him you would like to try it on him first with a strap on and see what he says|`|B7idbFNVaa	Tell him that NOT all girls can handle anal sex, and that you are one of them. Or you can turn the table around by saying NEGATIVE stuff about anal sex so he can feel GUILTY so next time he would bring it up.|`|PoQq7ECoaa	Just tell him you're not ready for it yet.  IF he keeps bugging you, he might just be using you for it.  If he was really your boyfriend he'd respect your decision.  Also, tell him he watches too much porn.. :P|`|Le2ZgrMlaa	Well It wont hurt to try it once but If you don't feel comfortable doing that sort of thing you should just flat out tell him you don't want to do it.  Dancing around the subject wont get you anywhere.|`|7XIa76Usaa	Tell him definitely not and turn over. There is a much better place for his penis just below your belly button that will love the pleasure.|`|n4ABuw2oaa	ya gotta take it one step at a time...get him to stimulate the area during a romantic session, see how you like it...then maybe have him insert a finger or two, see how you like it...if you just go from nothing to him jamming his unit in there, it will hurt...you need to loosen the area up first and have a lot of lube available! just see how you feel during the romantic moments with him and if you like it or not.
6912a1aab09c3578f0c171589b5a1761aa	You shouldn't be dating her until her divorce is final.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	date her now! she is very emotional, say the right things and your in the sack b4 you know it, good luck|`|3Qxqh68xaa	Looking back on when I was dating during my divorce, I would say to stay connected as friends for now. She is definitely looking to fall quickly into a relationship to take the place of the security she's lost. I can't believe how crazed I was looking for someone else to take care of me and finding a new husband, when really I needed to step back and learn to take care of myself.
WD2WtX9raa	Sometimes when people are in relationships they find themselves thinking that things could be better if they're with somebody else. What you need to think about is if that's the truth though. Do you think you'd be happier with your ex or is it one of those 'is the grass greener on the other side' kind of things? On top of that you need to consider why you and your ex-girlfriend broke up. If there was a good reason for it then why would you want to get back together? If since you broke up things have been fixed then of course getting back together should be okay but then you have to think about your current relationship. Are you just going through a little rough patch that's making you look for an easy way out? Can you get over it? Or are you truely unhappy most of the time and spending a lot of your time thinking about your ex-girlfriend? If in the end you find that you actually want to be with your ex-girlfriend and believe you would be happier with her then let your current girlfriend know that you still have feelings for her and want to be with her instead. If not, stay with your girlfriend.|`|owzFxSjeaa	date all 3  or don't date any of them just hang out with them and than you get to have more fun.

io1175WFaa	+2 En realidad yo creo que no es que uno solo se deje llevar por el fìsico, la verdad es que el fisico ES LO PRIMERO QUE TE ATRAE es como cuando compras algo, por EJEMPLO: si compras un cereal que nunca habias comido lo mas seguro es que lo escogiste por la publicidad que se hace o por el dise?o de la caja(lo exterior), pero para que lo sigas comprando(para quedarse con ello) tiene que pasar la prueba, si sabe feo lo dejas quizas ni te lo comas y si te gusta mucho lo seguiras comprando(lo interior)(si veo una chica escultural voy a querer tener algo con ella, pero si es una boba cabeza hueca no me casaría con ella)<br>  <br>  igual pasa al revés A VECES ALGUIEN NO TE ATREAE DE INICIO pero al tratar a esta persona te empieza a llamar la atencion por la forma de ser<br>  (volavamos al ejemplo del cereal, a lo mejor hay uno con mal dise?o de caja y que no pone publicidad, pero en casa de algun amigo lo pruebas y te gusta asi que decides comenzar a comprarlo)|`|8cc2db467182cdb716687eeadb3884c8aa	el 90%|`|56ae3465822f559aae23b28e6fd101ceaa	obviamente que si aunque todos digamos que lo interior tambien es importante cuandconocemos a una persona nos gusta fisicamente nunca he escuchadoque aguien le diga "hablame un poquito para ver si me gustas" o " cuentame algo sobre ti para ver si eres lo que vusco"<br>  lamentablemente todo entra por la vista la ropa que usamos, lo que comemos y las personas que nos gustan <br>  ademas debes tener en cuenta que despues de concer muy bien  a las personas o en parte podemos decir si nos gustan realmente es un proceso que comienza con la vista aunque no te guste es y seguira siendo asi siempre|`|2d90d1a4f8274ce5b2294021e4b7cbe2aa	Creo q es natural, si tu ves a una chica en una fiesta o en el centro comercial no dices: se ve q es inteligente o, Dios, q ni?a tan sensible! es imposible q a primera vista te des cuenta de las cualidades de una persona y por qué no, de sus defectos... <br>  Preocupante sería q una vez q conversas con ella, q la empiezas a tratar, te quedaras solo con lo de afuera... <br>  Hay personas q no son muy agraciadas físicamente, pero se sienten bien con ellas mismas y proyectan seguridad, brillan con luz propia y eso las hace atractivas... además la "guapura" va en todo, desde la postura de las personas (si tu ves a alguien jorobado, denota flojera, inseguridad, alguien acomplejado por ejemplo), la mirada (alguien q te habla y no te voltea a ver), el tono de voz, la cercanía, la limpieza en todos los sentidos... son muchas cosas... <br>  Yo creo q tampoco se puede juzgar a alguien q se siente atraido en primer lugar por el físico, una vez q hacemos q piquen el anzuelo, lo importante es no dejarlos ir...|`|hpq3sYJgaa	La mayoría somos así.

No se puede estar en paz si uno está disgustado con uno o más aspectos de su cuerpo o de su personalidad. Empero, este es el caso de la mayoría de las personas debido a la constante presión que experimentan por parte de los medios de comunicación (léase: radio, televisión, revistas) para que sean de determinada manera. <br>  <br>  Son muy pocas las personas satisfechas con la manera en que vinieron al mundo. Generalmente el problema se centra en las características corporales y ello es así porque el tipo de sociedad en que vivimos ha otorgado una importancia excesiva a la apariencia del cuerpo como factor clave de exitosas relaciones interpersonales. Se insiste a través de los medios para que seamos más delgados, para que seamos más altos, para que nuestro cabello sea de tal color. Se nos dice que la popularidad, la cantidad de amigos que podemos tener, dependen de estos factores. <br>  <br>  En otras palabras, cuánto más "lindo" o "linda" uno es, más probabilidad tiene de ser popular entre sus conocidos y de conseguir amor y felicidad. Por lo menos esto es lo que quieren hacernos creer los avisos publicitarios de las empresas que lucran con la venta de productos para que la gente deje de ser "fea". El concepto que tienen estas empresas de la fealdad según los avisos que publican es que una persona es fea cuando no está en condiciones de desfilar por una pasarela luciendo la ropa de las casas de alta costura. <br>  <br>  La publicidad de estas empresas se ha centrado tradicionalmente en el sexo femenino, dado que el rol que estaba asignado por la sociedad a las mujeres era el de ser lo más atractivas posible a los fines de conseguir un esposo. Desde que tenemos noticia las mujeres se han preocupado por corregir los "errores" con que la Naturaleza las ha fabricado, a efectos de adaptarse al ideal vigente en el momento de su existencia. <br>  <br>  Ese ideal, como es sabido, ha ido cambiando con el tiempo y así ha habido épocas en que la mujer ideal tendía a la obesidad, mientras que en otras no se admitía más que el estilo ultra-delgado. El largo de los cabellos, el tama?o de los ojos y de la boca, por no hablar de otras partes de la anatomía, que los creadores de la moda consideran como los más deseables han ido cambiando con el paso de las décadas. Así se puede decir que durante los a?os veinte del siglo pasado imperaba un ideal de mujer que no era el mismo que se imponía veinte a?os después en la década de los cuarenta. <br>  <br>  Esta presión para que la mujer se adapte al ideal de moda en el momento se ha visto incrementada a partir de que no es solamente un recurso para no quedarse soltera, sino también para la supervivencia de las grandes compa?ías que obtienen enormes ganancias de la venta de productos para adelgazar, tinturas para el cabello, distintos cosméticos para realzar la apariencia, etc. Estas compa?ías, que no se destacaban para nada hace cincuenta a?os, ahora mueven cantidad exorbitantes de dinero y llenan de publicidad las páginas de las revistas y los espacios televisivos. <br>  <br>  saludos|`|JGoWbkfLaa	Mi estimada amiga:<br>  Podrás hacerlo dejándolo donde dices: en el pasado.<br>  Muchas veces los padres cometemos errores tan grandes sin darnos cuenta que marca a nuestros hijos de por vida.<br>  Sin duda fue un error de tu padre y estoy seguro que te lo dijo - no de muy buen modo - para hacerte reaccionar y lograr lo que has logrado: "bajar 60 kilos"!<br>  De todos modos no te preocupes por eso: ?te digo un secreto?: a mi me gustan las gorditas (aunque ahora no lo sos). <br>  Por otra parte, tu pinta es la cáscara que recubre un inmenso corazón generoso y tierno, además de tu alegría chispeante, tu candidez y sensibilidad.<br>  No te preocupes por uno que otro rechazo.

3tWlbje7aa	Hmm. The simple but honest answer is that there is nothing that you can say to "make" someone attracted to you. There isn't any trickery involved. By the looks of things, she sees you very firmly as a friend and what you received from her was just affection. That's just how it goes sometimes. Enjoy her company for what it is - friendship.

n105FXWeaa	Si es muy raro pon atencion donde trabaja y con quien habeces si trabaja con mujeres lindas o que le llamen la tencion quisas piensa en ella o fijate que no te este poniendo el cuerno porque para que un hombre no quiera tener relaciones es muy dificil de creer.

HAora que si sigue le mas mismas pues dile habla con el y dile mira viejo sabes uno de mujer tambien tiene nesesidades haci como ustedes y no me estas cumpliendo como yo quiero creo que ni para que digas que estas cansado porque el acto es placer no trabajo. Haci que o te pones la pilas o que vamos a hacer o quieres que lo busque por fuera lo que no me das tu porque dejame decirte amiga que cuando enganan los canijos esa es la escusa que usan. Haber que siente dile que quieres estar bien con el pero que tu necesitas tengan mas intimidad. Si el te quiere y no quiere llegar a perderte mira que le va a caer el veinte y se va a poner las pilas. SI no lo hace pues hay un problema.

Y dile que te hizo sentir muy  mal para qu eno lo vuelva a hacer. Y si de plano no mejora sus modales buscate a otro. La verdad es que si ellos llegan a comportarse como patanes es porque nosotros los tratamos como reyes cuando en realidad las reinitas somos nosotras!!!

AA10065812	Cheating with the ex would be hotter if I had an naked ice sculpture made her and had it place in my bed.|`|4HoVVCenaa	I think there is an element of residual love. I am still in love, to some extant with anyone I've ever been with, even if it has been years. I think men are capable of loving more than one person. Which doesn't mean with can't bond with one female and stay faithful. I was faithful to my wife for the 25 years of marriage that we had. I still however had some love for my pre-marriage girlfriends. But that was past history. I live in the present.|`|fQeS0qWWaa	depends on the love meter|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	sex and love are two totally different things. especially as it pertains to men.    if a guy cheats with an ex, it means, he is a cheater. that's all. he's isn't worth it for the current or the ex.    because he will cheat on you, too.    it means he is insecure seeking attention.    it is likely she wants to believe he still loves her, but...sex is sex.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	I think if they have any type of contact with an ex if they are not the baby momma or Daddy they might still have some type of feelings for them. But nothing to serious unless they cheat on u with them and they were in love before then yea definitely.

EagOe74laa	Well health wise most younger girl/older guy combinations leave the woman a widow, but most older/younger combos also end up with women who say they wouldn't have it any other way.  Age is not really a difference unless you want it to be one. What is really bothering you? That someone else might think it's to big of a hurdle or that he will age faster than you?  Figure out what's bothering you about this, talk with the bf about it and get it solved.  36-24 really isn't that big of a deal. I know of a married couple they've got a 25 year difference and they're happy.|`|jdRKZe18aa	No - I do not think it is or should be that big of a deal at ALL!  If you were a MINOR it would.  But you are both well into adult years, have had experience and relationships and are big grown ups now.  This kind of age difference is minimally significant in my opinion.  When I was 19 I dated a 30 year old, and when I was 21 I dated a 40 year old. I always liked older guys much better.  THen - I married someone 3 years younger than me! go figure!    Your age difference is NO BIGGIE!|`|8Mi15cTtaa	yes - you are barely on your own and he, hopefully, has been out there for over a decade. There is a lot of living and growing up during that time.|`|Rb087BsAaa	do you really want step-kids at 24?  Age isn't a big deal, but family life style is.  I don't date girls with kids....|`|y5P4dY7aaa	When it comes to love age is nothing but a number you old enough and your legal, go for it.|`|L5jjhYnNaa	If you really care for him...  and you can handle all the  obstacles,his children,and  other peoples [pointless]  comments....everything  will be fine,age in you  situation [since your not  fifteen :) shouldn't be an issue]  Hope everything  works out!|`|VnpAZTCDaa	if u r really 24 and hes really 36 then there really isn't much of a difference, considering women r about 7 years older then men mentally anyways , u r right on target as far as age goes , now if u were 18 -21 then yeah it would give people something 2 talk about, especially those old bitties who r 2 old & ugly 2 attract a man any more|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	so my cousin Nicky is 40 and his wifey is 26 it doesnt matter as long as you love each other|`|d5348844fa0d0a525f373ae1f2bf3a78aa	i don't think it's that big of a deal.|`|RihPWIfBaa	if you don't have a problem with wrinkly balls and he has no problem with being a pedophile then yous guys should be just fine. just kidding  hehe|`|NLxcfGplaa	No I am a bit older than my boyfriend and his family doesn't care, we have been together for 4 years.  People always talk about other people just don't pay attention. Was it someone you know or stranger?|`|vLAGnmGEaa	Yuck! I'm 24 and I would never date a 36 year old.. That's soooo old! Men that old are already getting wrinkles and maybe loosing hair. GROSS! He must pretty immature, perverted, or a cop to want to date someone that much younger. I know it seems like you two have so much in common, but you can't be that dumb. You two are on WAY different levels and he has experienced and grown so much more than you. Plus, do you really want to help raise some other woman's brats?? Save yourself  the future heart-break and leave him. Love isn't all you need. At least not these days.|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	No big deal at all, so long as the 2 of you are comfortable with it, which clearly you are, so screw what others think.|`|AA10655085	Honestly, it varies with the ages at the time.  Right now you're 24 and he's 36, and that's do-able just fine.  Bump it up to the point where he's 70 and you're 58, and there may very well be a difference in energy levels, etc.  So, I'm referring to the changes that can occur over the long-haul.  If both of you are aware of, and content with that, then go for it.|`|JgNjdsqOaa	12 years is not worth to speak about. I would rather consider other issues regarding your relationship.|`|CbGBuie4aa	No Way ! If You Love The guy Then Its fine ! x|`|3e43f2703ad550398fdee26584071d95aa	nope    as long as you truly love each other, that's all the really matters|`|xp2NyAQIaa	Like they say age is just a  . And you should not let that affect your love for someone. Be happy and forget what other people say! (or think)|`|FU5z9yWuaa	i think age is just a number and that if ur in love u should never care what society thinks and people who usually have something to comment about ones relationship are usually jealous or the people that dnt really matter...hope u have a long and lasting relationship hang on if u love him|`|JlDZjyR6aa	No, not if you love each other! But always remember, if he dies 12 years before you do (naturally) then you are going to be alone for that long.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Do what you want, and I definately have to give him props. I am guessing that he is somewhat successful or you wouldn't be there. There is nothing wrong with that as long as you are both happy. Just think he was driving before you were in kindergarden. lol|`|Le4hlm6haa	no age doesn't matter but maturity does if you both feel mature enough to carry on with the relationship there's nothing to worry about. you're just 2 adults dating like any other couple.  I personally think if you're both over the age of 18 it doesnt matter anyway!    Stay together don't let something like age get in the way of your relationship.|`|ns5Sovo3aa	Of course not. I have been with someone for 8 years and hes 13 years older than me. Age is nothing all that matters is how you feel and how they  feel about you.|`|AA11570274	to be honest i dont think your age difference is such a big deal...if you were 24 and he was 50 then id say definately! but 36 isnt that much older and if it working well then why not give it a proper chance...however you do need to consider how it is affecting others particularly if he has kids but if thats not an issue then yea Id say your fine just as long as youre both happy! Good Luck :)|`|be0YaDUPaa	Age matters alot for some people, and very little for others.  Keep dating him, but keep your eyes open.  If things stay good, great....just don't lie to yourself.  The age thing may not seem like much after only a couple of months, but after 6 months or a year it could be different.  If the age difference does become an issue, don't stay with him because you don't want to make him feel bad or you don't want to be alone.  Enjoy it while it lasts, and when it's not fun anymore, move on.

Si hay un convivio, participa de forma ligera, no intimides y si te hacen preguntas indiscretas y de tu vida privada, responde con evasivas o de una manera firme y educada diles que no te agrada platicar cosas íntimas, pero hazlo con una sonrisa, recuerda que "lo cortés no quita lo valiente".<br>  Si te enteras que hay un chisme a tus espaldas, no averigues con ellos mismos ni reclames nada, no te pongas a su altura.<br>  Y sobre todo, haz tu trabajo con profesionalidad, eficacia y eficiencia. porque eso es lo que te recomendará y al final, si tu jefe es inteligente, sabrá apreciar para tu crecimiento.<br>  No cabe duda que te tienen envidia, tu actúa como si nada pasara, se natural, y si te gusta vestir bien, arreglarte y andar siempre elegante y presentable, hazlo.<br>  Ahhhh y como con tu forma de comportarte, aumentarán las envidias, nunca olvides cerrar bien tu archivero, los cajones de tu escritorio, tu oficina, no dejes papeles importantes a la vista ni al alcance de nadie, no permitas que nadie toque tu equipo de cómputo, no hagas llamadas personales que puedan escuchar, por ningún motivo se te ocurra tener un romance con gente de tu oficina ni con tu jefe, no les proporciones informacion personal: domicilio, teléfono particular, sueldo, etc. <br>  Al salir de tu casa, encomienda tu día, tu vida y tu trabajo a Dios.|`|73eeef0d7d795ef67a92df1696b54140aa	Tú ni caso.

C. Green – Los Angeles Lakers Acabei minha oitava temporada com o time NBA e este intervalo entre os jogos será muito bem-vindo. Poderei dar um descanso para o meu físico e também uma pausa no ritmo alucinado de viagens e entrevistas constantes. Mesmo assim, é difícil escapar do público. Eu tenho 2 metros e 27 centímetros de altura e, como a maioria dos jogadores de basquete, facilmente nos despontamos em uma multid?o. Como profissional do basquete tenho que me relacionar com os “fans-clubes” dos vários locais onde vamos jogar. é impressionante, mas tanto meus colegas quanto eu, somos perseguidos pelas meninas que fazem de tudo para sair conosco, desde o momento em que chegamos até a nossa partida. Elas est?o em todos os lugares - aeroportos, recep??o dos hotéis, restaurantes e quadras de jogo - sempre tentando chamar nossa aten??o. Poucos resistem a esses avan?os. Eu, pessoalmente, n?o sei quantos jogadores do “NBA” s?o virgens, mas posso afirmar que s?o pouquíssimos. Os jogadores profissionais de basquete possuem uma imagem de super-saudáveis e, n?o nos ajuda muito, quando um antigo jogador, super famoso como o Witt Chamberlain vivia se gabando de já ter ido para a cama com mais de 20.000 mulheres diferentes! Enquanto me mantenho sexualmente puro, continuo a ouvir as conversas de quarto de meus colegas sobre suas últimas conquistas amorosas. Eu, porém, me recuso a permitir que isso enfraque?a minha postura, pois decidi firmemente seguir os padr?es de Deus em minha vida. Falei de minha posi??o para meus colegas Alguns, por goza??o, disseram que iriam marcar encontros para mim com algumas mulheres que consideravam irresistíveis. “...e aí veremos se você é t?o forte quanto diz ser...” disseram brincando. N?o quero ser mal-entendido. O sexo em si, n?o é ruim. é somente uma quest?o de quando utilizá-lo. Deus criou o sexo para nosso deleite, mas o limitou ao casamento. Por isso estou esperando a hora certa. A Bíblia diz em Filipenses 4:13: “Tudo posso naquele que me fortalece”. Eu me apropriei desse versículo. A Bíblia também diz que nenhuma tenta??o seria maior do que as for?as que Ele dá. Gostaria realmente que todos os jovens ouvissem esta mensagem. é possível esperar! Nem todos est?o embarcando nessa de sexo antes do casamento! Há três anos comecei a Funda??o Jovem A.C. Green em Los Angeles. é uma fus?o de acampamentos para jogar basquete, onde também ajudamos os jovens a encontrarem empregos provisórios durante as férias e aproveitamos para passar-lhes alguns direcionamentos. Muitos dos adolescentes que me ouvem já s?o sexualmente ativos há anos. Sabendo disso eu lhes apresento o conceito da “segunda” virgindade. “Pelo fato de já ter tido sexo no passado, vocês podem pensar que agora n?o há mais motivos para esperar. Mas, há um caminho melhor a ser seguido. O caminho de Deus. Talvez vocês se sintam culpados, indignos, mas Deus pode perdoá-los. Vocês podem assumir perante Deus o compromisso de manterem-se puros a partir de agora até o dia em que se casarem”. Sei que esses jovens precisam de um modelo. E apesar de n?o querer me colocar em um pedestal, ponho-me como um referencial por Cristo. Tenho orgulho de dizer que sou virgem e fa?o quest?o de dizer que Deus tem me dado for?as para esperar. Você pode estar pensando em como conciliar minha mensagem com a de um outro colega de profiss?o, o conhecido Magic Johnson. Acredito que a mídia e a sociedade s?o mais propensas a aceitarem a mensagem de Johnson do que a minha. Ele diz que os jovens devem continuar a fazer sexo, mas que devem tomar todas as precau??es e utilizar<br>  preservativos para evitar os riscos de doen?as. Minha mensagem é diferente. Os fatos mostram que nem sempre os preservativos funcionam. E, para os adolescentes, essa taxa de falhas é ainda pior. é mentira afirmar que é só vestir uma camisinha que você ficará seguro! Tremo ao ouvir essas coisas. Os preservativos já n?o s?o 100% seguros para evitar gravidez, quanto mais para bloquear o vírus do HIV, que é 450 vezes menor do que o espermatozóide. é como uma rede tentando segurar água! Algumas pessoas perguntam se eu tenho namorada. Tenho sim. Ela é uma pessoa que resoeita a si mesmo e possui um alto padr?o e valores morais. Partilhamos dos mesmos alvos e objetivos, particularmente quanto a mensagem aos adolescentes do valor da espera. A primeira coisa a ser dita é: “é preciso aprender a respeitar a si mesmo para podermos respeitar os outros.” A.C. Green - Jogador profissional de basquete do “Los Angeles Lakers”. Tinha 29 anos de idade quando escreveu esta mensagem<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Namoro - Abstinência Sexual<br>  <br>  MéDICO ACONSELHA ABSTINêNCIA SEXUAL PARA JOVENS O aumento alarmante do número de casos de doen?as sexualmente transmissíveis (DST) e gravidez entre adolescentes fez com que um médico da Gr?-Bretanha sugerisse uma nova forma de preven??o aos jovens: a abstinência sexual. O Servi?o Laboratorial de Saúde Pública da Gr?-Bretanha constatou que, desde 1995, aumentaram em 77% os casos de clamídia, em 57% os casos de gonorréia e em 56% os casos de sífilis. A situa??o levou o doutor Trevor Stammers a escrever um artigo para o British Medical Journal, uma das mais respeitadas publica??es britanicas da área, pedindo aos médicos que estimulem a abstinência. O doutor lembrou que, nos EUA, uma campanha pela abstinência sexual provocou uma queda significativa do número de adolescentes grávidas. A idéia causou polêmica entre a comunidade médica.

hXQjnPuGaa	He probably didn't mean it to sound as bad as it did.    She should ask him what she should do to make it more exciting.    Maybe he didn't mean her specifically, but women in general. In missionary position, that pretty much is all the woman does.  They should try different positions, I guess. Lots of guys also like it when women make lots of noise, screaming and such.     Maybe ask him what he did mean, if he didn't mean it in a bad way.|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Imagine all the foreplay a man does before he gets to sex and all the foreplay it often takes to turn a woman on to make sure she has an orgasm during sex.  That is the effort that he wants sometimes.  And just like men do for women at times she should make him finish before she does.  Men's bodies are more than just a penis, there are other parts that feel good when touched too (like everywhere).  Sex is not the only thing that a man wants.  He wants to feel attractive, irresistible, and wanted just like women do.  A lot of looking at his body up and down to show you appreciate it and like looking at it.  Sometimes she should go down on him and not expect anything in return (except that he do the same every once in a while).  Does this make sense?|`|LdYMI72iaa	This is a really hard situation. After a while in a relationship sex can become very repetitive and almost going through the motions. Its hard for us girls to feel like sex kittens all the time and busy lives mean we dont always have the time or energy for a session involving every position from the karma sutra. It must be really hard now for Nina to feel sexy at all since her partners comments but it sounds like he is a typical man and did'nt phrase the comment very well or consider how it would hurt her feelings.  If she loves him, which she obviously does, she wants to make their sex life a great part of the relationship. But she should remember that sex involves two people and he should be part of making it fun for her too. I think communication is really important, what each of them likes etc etc but this is gonna be really tricky now that negative comments have been made.   Alchohol can increase confidence but its a false confidence that won't last. Sex is supposed to be fun and with a great partner it is. Tell her she shouldn't put all the pressure on herself to make the sex great, it should be a joint effort. She should think of what things she'd like to do with her partner not just whats gonna make him happy.  Its not neccesarily about different positions its about her being active and engaged in it because she's enjoying it and enjoying being with him. Try and get her to put the fun back into their sex then she'll relax and start to enjoy herself.|`|u1uECuFNaa	What an *ss.   Yeah, switch it up. Move a bit more.   Perhaps watch some movies.....if that is in the picture.   Don't let him get away with that. All he is most likely doing is moving his *ss back and forth, too! Right?  So many different ways to do it....watch a movie or grab a Cosmopolitan magazine. (Or Glamour.)  :)  Or just look it up on their websites if porn is too much for you.   She also should ask him what he would like...perhaps his fantasy. In a light teasing manner.   If he was not happy, I am sure he would be looking elsewhere and not sleeping with her at all.|`|UNZuciedaa	leave the back door unlocked|`|CoKAaPYqaa	The best thing she can do is talk it over with him. Maybe if there secure about there sex life make it not such an uncomfortable conversation or experience by watching a porn together and she can just casually be like " baby how would you like it if we/i did that to you? " They may not be into all that but its a good ice breaker. I know she may also feel that when she goes to try new positions and things shell feel like hes thinking "shes only doing it now because i said something" So thats why i just recomended watching the porn together. Maybe just take charge. Let her make the first move at him. I cant really be sure if he meant what he said in a hurtful way or not. It seems to me he didnt mean to hurt her feelings and was trying to be open about it but once she was hurt he did cover his butt. But I understand where hes coming from too... If its always the same stuff that would get kinda borning. Just have them have fun with it. try new things and thatll bring on new positions. If the guy is always getting back on top after she rides him have her try a different way of riding im. tell her to turn around so her back is facing his from. Its easier and you and move in more ways and it seems to be better that way. He also gets the opportunity to see your *** bouncing and he can grab it and smack that too. I hope this helps. My relationship got kind of boring. well it still is because im more of a freak then my babys father but i just try to do different things once and awhile to keep it fresh and alive. Good luck.|`|0FBqoeGWaa	i am sure she  is a beautiful and exciting woman. the problem might just be him, as it is usually whats wrong with us that we think we see in others. Your self esteem should not suffer, it's only one persons opinion, you are worth more than that, and with the right person he'll think the world of you and all you do, yeah including that...|`|M4X3HOV5aa	i don't think its a big deal. women say they want an honest man but get offended when they hear the truth.|`|4181fz5Oaa	I am married and that has never happened to me my husband and I are animals in bed and we love each other so much we can't stop jumping one another but I would say maybe her man is on the small side and he doesn't want ot deal with a girl who sounds like she is to good for him just a thought . Take care and good luck:)|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	I would be upset but maybe he really didn't mean it in a bad way and some men like to be in total control.|`|Gcj1qFZ8aa	my husband said the same thing to me they just want us to be a freak in the bed and if thats not what we want then we dont have to do it they have to cater to our needs to.|`|SngOU70Baa	they both need to stop complain. 2 babies here.

I've been away for a mighty long time.  lol    To simply put it...your friend really could be overreacting....  However, in all honesty, she should be talking to her bf about this issue...not to you.  There are sooooo many teaching material out there that could help them both sexually (books, tapes, counselors, etc.).  It won't get better until they discuss this with each other.  You can give her all the tips in the world, but if they don't have a meeting of the minds...she has really no clue what could be "turning him off."|`|bcd7737bcd35a4cdbfcc87efd6f62866aa	I would be pissed, but I'd not let it get to me.    Biggest thing is she needs to get to the bottom of the comment because it is effecting her.  Regardless of if it was in jest or not he crossed a line there.  He first needs to say that he is sorry.  Really, a man who loves his girl would realize that he spewed verbal diarrhea and hurt her.  He needs to use the word 'sorry'... not 'I didn't mean it in a bad way" bs.    Second....  if that comment comes up perhaps he has some insecurities of his sexual relationship with her.  They should both talk about what they want in their sex life.  My guy and I always make sure to keep lines of communications open.  We live together and don't argue, BUT we do tell each other when we are uncomfortable about something, or disappointed in something.  We talk things through.  We act much older than we are.  Communication is a key base for a good relationship.... a corner stone perhaps.  Talk things through with him (HELL print off this response and give it to him as a way to get things rolling!).  This talk could get into why he said that, what you BOTH can do to resolve the issue AND express the desire to communicate better.|`|gsS0c3yVaa	It takes communication and two active participants to keep things spiced up!!!  Talk it out and then bang it out!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|bnGjll1faa	maybe ask him what she can do to make it better|`|AA11335702	Start watching some porno and just do the damn thing.|`|i15KoiJhaa	Yea that was a pretty rude thing for him to say.    If he thinks the sex is boring, doesn't seem he is doing much that is productive to change it up does it? Rude comments like that have gotten her attention, but not in a good way.    So if she is feeling that things need to switched up a little then she is going to need to find some self confidence and get it done. LOL Who knows? Maybe she will scare the crap out of him when she throws his butt down and tells him to shut up and hold on!    He probably didn't mean to be such a jerk a**  (at least I hope he didn't) she needs to sit his butt down and tell him that it hurt her feelings and it takes 2 to get it "right" so he can put up or shut up.

Blame yourself.  You're only 17 and already dealing with hangovers, which means that you're on a bad road, and while so very young.  Drinking will take years off your life, and leads directly to alcoholism.  I'll bet that you're already drinking and driving too.  That's typical... and sad.<br>  <br>  I say... apologize to your Dad... then give him the gift of you swearing off of alcohol.  Stop drinking- period, and tell him that you've done so, and truly don't do it anymore.  Life is too short, for you to go out of your way to make it even shorter.  Don't be a hazard to yourself, and others.  Stop now, and make your Dad a happy man.<br>  <br>  Alcoholism killed my mother.  She died right in front of me- a brain anorism, brought on by years of alcohol abuse.  I had to do CPR on her right on the spot, but... she was gone, and forever.  Alcohol killed her.  She just refused to accept any help.<br>  <br>  You're only 17... and think that you'll life forever.  Oh... how quick the years will seem to have gone by by the time you're old enough to really look back.  But you're not invulnerable.  Stop now, what you're doing, before it's too late.<br>  <br>  Your Dad comes to see you, because he loves you.  Show that you love him as well... but putting the bottle down, and stop drinking.  It's already screwing you up, and... it can only get worse.<br>  <br>  That's my advice.  I hope that you're listening.  I hope.  And good luck.  I think that you'll need it.<br>  <br>  ~ Jon<br>  Alcohol Victim|`|cyanbMaqaa	you simply wishes him happy father's day and tell him the best gift you give him is a prayer for him in your heart  before the Lord.|`|vUjs9G4Qaa	I'm not close with my father either...Wasn't much of a father figure in my eyes, only say him once every 2 weeks also. I didn't even like that. Anyways on to you. Your 17. Your dad is 35 or older and probably understands in his own way. Of course your going to feel guilty and what not cuz you were hung over and forgot about it was your time to see him...just call him up and see if it bother him be like, 'dad i'm sorry about the other day [if he's ok with you drinking] i was hung over and i totally forgot that it was our day. blah blah blah. its easy. people are usually pretty good with forgiving their children.

S28KtWLqaa	Milico, nada é definitivo. Depende do tipo de m?e. Isto acontece por causa da m?e e n?o do filho. Acho que, quando isso acontece quem está precisando de aten??o é a m?e. é para ela que precisa haver alguém na escola que saiba cuidar e orientar.|`|8pg2kkTFaa	normal claro que é?|`|9QD72vjhaa	sim|`|H94Gn4Fsaa	acho que deve deixar ele sozinho...isso pode levar a goza??es e o costume de ter sempre a mae do lado pra resolver os problemas que ele vai encontrar na vida.<br>  N?o que a mae nao pode ajudar, mas a crian?a, desde pequena, tem que se acostumar a enfrentar obstáculos.|`|RmOgwGkYaa	é algumas m?es fazem isso principalmente se for o primeiro ou único filho!|`|eFAlYsSyaa	é NORMAL SIM, O MEU FILHO QUANDO FOI NO PRIMEIRO DIA A AULA EU N?O PODIA FICAR JUNTO PORQUE A ESCOLA N?O PERMETIA MAS EU FIQUEI ESCONDIDA ATRAZ DA JANELA POR MAS DE 2 HORAS FAZER O QUE COISAS DE M?E .|`|phVMlGKAaa	é normal a crian?a chorar por inseguran?a, por estar com pessoas estranhas.<br>  <br>  mas n?o é recomendável a m?e leva-lo para casa toda vez q chora|`|zxNyDEDBaa	eu concordo com vc pois os filhos tambem n?o v?o ficar agarrado a gente o tempo todo|`|d0vjRTizaa	Na minha opini?o  as m?es deveriam ficar com o filho no PRIMEIRO dia de aula....mas há sempre aquelas crian?as que choram todos os dias na inten??o de a m?e ficar TODOS os dias na escola, pensamos que as crian?as n?o possuem essa capacidade mental, mas quando querem algo s?o capazes de tudo, mesmo sem perceber...Mesmo que a crian?a  chore muito acho que n?o  é certo ficar mais que um dia na escola com ela....além do que os professores do seu filho s?o especializados nesse tipo de coisa, se n?o n?o dariam aula para crian?as dessa idade.|`|f2ffWEzmaa	`- éh normal sim... Atéh pke, a crian?a ainda n?o teve a experiência de ficar junto a multid?es... E isso éhuma experiência nova para eles, por isso reagem t?o mal assim<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Beijo|`|soJDdKiyaa	N?o acho isso normal, faz com que o menino fique mal acostumado e sempre vai chorar.<br>  O ideal é deixa-lo chorando pra ele acostumar.|`|vtHu40uPaa	é normal tanto as crian?as pequenas chorarem nos primeiros dias de aula quanto a m?e querer ficar junto, mas n?o é bom a m?e ficar, porque isso vai prejudicar o la?o afetivo que deve unir crian?a e professor. Quando a m?e escolhe uma escola para seu filho ela tem que confiar nos profissionais que ir?o trabalhar com ele e se ela confia n?o tem por que ficar junto, mesmo com o filho chorando. Antes de tomar a decis?o de colocar a crian?a na escola a m?e deve conversar bastante com ela, geralmente elas choram porque é uma situa??o nova que est?o enfrentando e acham que v?o ficar lá pra sempre, que a m?e n?o vai voltar pra buscá-las. é aí que entra o professor, com sua paciência, amor e experiência vai fazer com que a crian?a se adapte a nova situa??o, vai passar seguran?a e controlar o caso . Com a presen?a da m?e isso vai demorar mais pra acontecer. A m?e pode até ficar na escola pra ver se a crian?a vai se acalmar, mas longe dos olhos dela. Já vi muitas crian?as chorando desesperadamente enquanto a m?e está perto e parar logo depois que a m?e sai, brincar e ficar toda faceira até a hora de ir embora e no outro dia repetir a rotina até o dia em que ela n?o vai chorar mais, porque sabe que a m?e n?o vai atender ao apelo do choro e levá-la embora. O la?o afetivo professor-aluno é muito importante nos primeiros anos escolares para o próprio desenvolvimento da crian?a, para que ela seja independente, confiante e segura.|`|8b621dd782bfa50b9715969ea059c1c5aa	Olha eu já passei por essa experiência 2 vezes, apesar de ser mto coruja eu achei melhor nas duas vezes deixa-los (pq s?o 2 filhos), e até hoje acho q foi a decis?o mais acredita, pois hoje os dois s?o seguros de si e independentes (cada um compativel com sua idade), eu particularmente acho q se vc acompanha a crian?a em tudo, n?o há a possibilidade dela desenvolver-se e pode por em risco a confian?a q ela deve adquirir sobre si mesmo.|`|c62PjDZPaa	é normal sim, minha tia ficou comigo 1 semana, até eu parar de chorar<br>  a crian?a chora pq se sente insegura|`|0gbecwayaa	é normal sim<br>  toda m?e faz isso<br>  eu ja fiz muito isso com minhas filhas<br>  <br>  bjussss|`|MGQ7hsTLaa	acho normal, ja q a crian?a é pequena e está acostumada a ficar perto dos pais (principalmente da mae)... so que isso nao pode persistir ate  a crian?a virar um marmanjo, imagina q vergonha???|`|RDwoW2Apaa	Caro Milico,quero ver vc pensar assim quando for pai,n?o só é normal,como aconselhável pelos próprios professores,pois perto dos pais ir?o se sentir seguras já se encontram em um ambiente totalmente desconhecido para eles,como vc se sentiria de ver seus pais te largarem em um lugar desconhecido e forem embora,reflita,ok,abra?os|`|f8cfdc303543848643137183a01aa830aa	Concordo com você, mas ao mesmo tempo endendo a m?e que assim procede.

Si tu acostumbras dormir 7 hrs diariamente tu cuerpo está adaptado a ello para sentirse bien. Ahora si un día solo duermes 4 hrs, a tu cuerpo le faltaron 3 hrs por lo q se siente cansado.

Sin embargo cuando duermes en exceso tu cuerpo no está acostumbrado a estar acostado por un tiempo prolongado y cuando te levantas tu organismo en vez de estar recuperado esta cansado por el exceso de horas de sue?o. Te recominedo que para no sientas ese cansancio es necesario no tomar bebidas alcoholicas ni fumar ó comer demasiado antes de dormir pues eso altera tu sue?o y por ende tu descanzo.|`|BMkpVHrMaa	ya q tu organismo esta acostumbrado a dormir poco|`|H8HPlMoDaa	Mira, a lo que yo se de estas cosas, el cuerpo, de acuerdo a nuestra edad y actividad diaria necesita ciertas horas de descanso... hay algunas tablas de horas de sue?o que estan por edades, empezando con los bebes con las mas numerosas, casi 16 diarias, un joven adulto que es lo que pienso que eres, necesita entre 8 y 10 horas... Ahora, si te pasas de esas horas, es muy posible que te sientas cansado, debido a que te pasaste de lo que tu cuerpo requiere y cae en un desajuste...<br>  <br>  Espero te sirva esto, saludos...

Also, I know of this reeeeeeeally HUGE guy (min of 300 lbs, prob even more) & he's MARRIED. His wife is very very pretty too. I was surprised to find out that he was engaged/married. Even very obese peeps find true love. Peeps who are in their 20s are very lucky to get married that young. I'm 27 & am not married.

So Maybe you intimidate them?...... Good luck.|`|Lf2lPyFFaa	you must have a bad reputation then. If its not your looks then it might be a past relationship. Probably the way you treated the girl or talked to her. probaly you hurted their feelings but they didnt tell you. Or maybe its the way you try to grab their attention.  Maybr you joke too much and most girls want serious guys. If you joke alot it might be that you may not be serious in a relationship in the future. <br>  some of the girls you talk to dont know the "you" inside and they whats outside. dont get down becasue of that you will find a true love. You know how sisters are very playful.|`|xvzLMA7Gaa	I went out last night and I met a guy who seemed great at first.  Then he got a little pushy.  I ran from the bar as fast as I could.  <br>  Maybe you come on too strong (or not enough.)  Women are not all the same in what they want, but they act alike when they're interested.  You have to watch her actions.  If she sits or stands closer, eans towards you, plays with her hair, smiles & talks to you, or touches you (nicely), she likes you.  If she doesn't do any of this, tell her to have a good one, and start over tomorrow.<br>  Where are you meeting women and how are you speaking to them?  Many women are scared by too much, too soon.  Don't push for too much.  Say hello, talk a little.  Tell her it was nice to meet her, you'd like to get to know her better. If she agrees, ask about meeting.   Let her decide. I personally prefer lunch for a first date.    <br>  Do something new to meet women.  Check the local singles organizations.  Walk around your neighborhood, or participate in town events.  Join a yahoo group.  Take a  class- dance or otherwise.<br>  Brush up on your conversation skills.  Know current events, but stay away from religion & politics.  Learn some clean, cute jokes. (How do you make a tissue dance? Put a little boogie in it!)  Stay away from sex talk and double entendres.  Avoid potty humor.  Be clean, freshly shaven, nice smelling and dressed simply. Be nice to everyone- sometimes the people you meet may have a daughter, niece or granddaughter.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and always smile (but leave the creepy smile for Jack Nicholson).

But the fact is parents want to know that their kids can be trusted and be independent. But I feel you need to talk to them about how you feel about the situation, try not to compare what your brothers have done because then she will be thinking of them and maybe feel sorry for them and forget about you and your accomplishments.  So let them know what you feel you have done and are doing to deserve this car.  Just sit them down and give them all the positive information and then let them know that you would let them think about it and would like some feedback on the situation.  But please do not argue with them that's the last thing that you want to do with parents when you are needing their help.  Good luck......|`|X3K25srLaa	wow.. If I were your parent I'd be happy happy happy.. anyways.. you would have to prove to them how responsible you are .. by doing things that have to be done without them asking you too.. also, you really will not show your true responsibility until u get that car... a lot of girls your age own a car and are going crazy.. sometimes.. peers tend to pressure you in doing crazy things.. maybe your parents are just afraid... that something might happen to you.. and u can't respond by saying "nothing is going to happen, because you don't even know that.. but I think that you are doing everything that is necessary to show your responsibility...

That's just the way it is.<br>  <br>  It's time, I think, to start again.  Free yourself of her and move on, to find someone who will treat you better, whom also may potentially actually love you.  You can leave her and go play the field.  If she's giving you the cold shoulder, it's likely already over between you and her anyway.  You just haven't accepted that yet.<br>  <br>  So then... accept it, that it's over, and then go and seek out someone else.  It's time for a new start.

SpL9XYVQaa	I would contact the EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission), especially if this person is a superior.   This is ABSOLUTELY illegal.  If there's a lawyer in the family (who'd work pro bono), I'd talk to him/her, too.  <br>  <br>  I hate to say this, but this is the world of chronic medical conditions -- especially epilepsy.  There is such a huge stigma that dates back millennia to epilepsy that it is difficult for people to see us as anything BUT someone with epilepsy.

W618lfZ6aa	United states, white.      If you love someone nothing should stop you, if its race, sex or age(well not creepy difference).    Your family is your family, nothing you can do about them, you love them no matter what, they should learn to accept whoever you choose to date/marry. If they don't they do not love you as much as they should.    I'm attracted to pretty much any race and nothing would stop me if I fell for a girl, could be Muslim for all I care!      If you really want to date this person, you need to talk to your mom or dad, alone, and tell them how you feel, tell them to respect you!

Por supuesto, no es una solución factible, entonces no hay más remedio que tratar de estar lo mejor posible durante el duelo. El dolor va a existir en la medida que hayas amado y sentido algo profundo, cuando más profundo más difícil sacarlo del pensamiento, para eso no hay aspirina. Qué ayuda? Estar ocupado en otra cosa, no sirve buscar un reemplazante inmediatamente, nadie va a ser tan bueno, ni tan lindo, ni nada, sólo hasta que finalmente logres olvidar.<br>  Cuándo pasa eso? Cuando pasa, pueden ser dos meses, un a?o, tal vez más y pero un día y esto si te lo puedo asegurar, vas a ver que no te acordas ni del nombre.|`|Gh6ObRjsaa	siempre sale lastimado el que ama ,.pero a veces es mejor , que vivr en un dilema toda la vida y no ser feliz nunca...|`|PcmTW3dIaa	Amiga:<br>  <br>  Lo que no se da es por que no conviene, me imagino que debes ser una chica linda, lista y muy educada.

Y mas si estabas enamorada de él . Para serte honesta yo estoy tratando de olvidar a alguien. Ese alguien es una persona que amo, de la que me enamore. Pero que debido a su situacion actual no podemos estar juntos. Hace dos a?os que lo estoy esperando. Y he decidido por mi bien (y con todo el dolor que esto acarrea) cerrar este capitulo. No niego que estoy destrosada, pero tambien me doy cuenta que tengo que recomenzar una vida que habia dejado en espera por él. Es doloroso amiga, pero se puede. Yo intento salir a algun lado, asi sea a solo tomarme una cerveza sola. Hago muchas actividades (que me mantienen ocupada la cabeza por un tiempo). Y en las noches (que es cuendo mas pienso en él), lloro como loca. Pero creo que todo esto es necesario para poder salir de esto. Un consejo: no te encierres y si debes sufrir hacelo. Pero no lo llames, no te pongas en contacto con él, solo vas a reabrir una herida que siempre conviene cicatrizar.

mwEBrwlOaa	Threesomes are risky and if you have one there is no guarantee that it will be succesful. Being new is difficult as you do not have any reference on how to have one and it almost as though you are feeling your way in the dark.      I get the sense from reading your question that one of three things happened here or a combination. Your posting reads as though maybe you rushed into it without thinking about it, there was underlying relationship issues that were brought to the surface from having your threesome, or you had a difficult time seeing your wife having sex with someone else. I know asking such a sensitive question on Yahoo Answers deserves a thought out reply and I will give you one. However I do not want you think that I am criticizing your actions or in anyway putting you down, as I am not. All I am trying to do is provide some insight where it may have gone wrong and how to get beyond it.    Why do I think you may have rushed into it without thinking about it? Well, for starters your wife was texting him about two weeks before the threesome. If you had talked about communicating with the third person before meeting and put some boundaries in place maybe this would not have happened. Also if you had talked about relationship boundaries such as what can be said in regard to the threesome and agreeing not to use it against the other might have helped too.    Second possibility is that there was an underlying relationship issue. You state she was craving him after. Usually this is a sign that he provided her with something that the relationship did not and if this is the case I would guess that a part of the reason for having the threesome was to add some 'spice' to the relationship?     An ancillary issue I am left to wonder is if the third person was a friend? Your posting implies that it might though you do not say for sure. If it was a friend then it explains allot and explains her behavior.    Moving on, one part that I do not see a problem with is the fact she was totally focused on him. This is can be normal in a threesome situation especially if she feels secure and comfortable in the threesome. So I am left to wonder if the third issue comes down to you not being able to deal with the situation? Meaning the issues did not arrive until after the threesome and after you had time to process what happened? I suspect a part of the issue may revolve around not being able to cope with seeing your wife enjoy herself sexually with another person? Having had mfm threesomes myelf I know it is not easy and in no way I am putting you down. It is something you need to prepare yourself for, be able to seperate that sex is completely different in a threesome situation than a between a couple, and remember it is you she choose.       How do you get over it? I think you have learned the need to talk things through and talk after it happens. The first step is to apologize to her and then work though together what happened. I feel once you begin talking the answer will come to you and you will be able to move past it. Do I think you should try another threesome? Not until the two of you have been able to put this behind you, understand what has happened, and have been able to re-establish your relationship. Finally does this mean you need therapy? Absolutely not, just good ole communication.    I wish you the best and hope it works out for you.|`|GJjpXeqyaa	you need more details on this one|`|9fZYkQisaa	if you both feel bad then of course you can get the love back. its just sex not love im sure she didn't fall in love with him just from sex she probably just got caught up in the moment and got a little to excited about it. she should know she is very lucky to have you most guys would NEVER have a threesome with another man and there wife. your a great guy for that and if she doesn't see that then she doesn't deserve you

loH0wJJxaa	Seducing someone and taking charge, I think, are two very completely different things...  you can seduce someone without having to touch them... so throwing them onto the bed may be aggressive, but I wouldn't consider it as having being seduced..<br>  <br>  I don't think that there is one particular thing or even a set of things that needs to be or has to be done..  its all in the mind.. the goal is to make the other person want you and need you.. how you go about it is up to you, but personally... I just use the vibe I get from the other person and just go with it..|`|a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	you can only drive someone crazy if they havent had u yet.....or better yet, if you know u can never get them|`|FX61Ebimaa	I smile =] then say "hello", you know how I do.. lol|`|92J8K3gVaa	i get aggressive and take charge. illl like push guys on the bed and get on top of them and take it from there. they love it|`|AA12234972	If i know they are watching me, I am more sensual in my movements and let hands linger in places, give em the eye, you know..that come hither for a present stare|`|EEiSJSUTaa	I think I am a natural seducer. The root of my seduction power is my innocence and optimism. <br>  <br>  I always bring back my inner child in everyone I meet with my sincere and spontaneous way. <br>  <br>  I enjoy every little things and making each moment memorable,  even a simple coffee date can be the most romantic moment!<br>  <br>  As how to drive someone crazy...? I don't know. I am not really good at it. I am not good at taking control, spanking and all those crazy kinky stuffs. <br>  <br>  A slow sexy dance with sensuality is what I usually do.|`|NYxjwETraa	well i was on the dance team for a while so typically i love to give dances, but he cant touch until i say so. sometimes i even blind fold him and the only thing he is than allowed to touch is any part of my body that touches his if something touches his hands he can touch but cant do it whenever he watns. I also love having the no talk sex, its hard sometimes, but so much fun. taking charge of the situation is sexy, along with knowing what the man wants. <br>  <br>  of course im married so him would be my husband (wink wink)
3a705bf0321bf4809136d6a880ae5862aa	Be there for her.  Listen to her.  Don't talk about yourself and say "yea well when I was molested by my ex blah blah blah" because that doesn't help her.  No matter what you are not in the exact same situation she's in. <br>  <br>  What may be good for her is to take her mind off it and go do girly stuff with her--go to the mall, do your nails, watch a movie, have a sleepover, etc.  It'll cheer her up, and you won't be saying the wrong thing because you won't be talking about it.  Just be willing to listen if she does bring it up, but only listen and ask questions, don't counterstory or offer extra information about your experience.|`|AA10714714	shes definetly going to need counseling after this but i say tell her she should do what is in her heart if she wants to testiyfy go ahead but if she doesnt dont make her but definetly get her some help or someone she can talk to to help her deal with the hard time|`|fJaWxFtKaa	Hang in there.  Even though it's your niece who was abused (this time) you're in a tough position as well but you're terrific to want to help her despite how worried you are.  Let her know you care about her and feel bad but also be aware that even though it's a terrible thing that has happened it's not your job to make her feel better or safe.  You can only support her as a relative would.<br>  <br>  She will benefit from professional help.  I hope your parents will be able to help her get some.  You might want to let them know about the National Alliance on Mental Illness, www.nami.org, which should be able to help them find resources for helping people with mental illness or who would benefit from mental health treatment due to trauma such as your niece has experienced.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I'll be thinking about you two.|`|vFF2cEHfaa	Get her out and go do stuff. Dont let her just sit around, it's summer time so you both should be outta school right now. Always be active, go for a jog, swimming. Play music and dance untill you cant move anymore.

Y ya en esa plàtica amena, pues descubrir si tienen afinidad o misma forma de pensar, o por lo menos parecida. Imagìnate que tù, por ejemplo, estuvieras a favor de los gays y èl no, o si tu tienes preferencia por un partìdo polìtico y èl no, todo eso, que tienes que ir descubriendo del chico que te gusta, y si hay afinidad, ?ya la hiciste!|`|dd5448b3179f2a3e794f5925d48ceb27aa	que te parece si le dices <br>  <br>  " quiero ser la funda de tu espada"  ja ja ja <br>  <br>  a ver que cara pone ?<br>  <br>  no te creas mejor dile " me gustas mucho " y ya <br>  <br>  suerte !!!!!!|`|hpq3sYJgaa	Hay muchas cosas q tu puedes hacer para conquistar a un chico sin decirle nada.

oXTY1Viaaa	Eso es cosa de cada uno, creo que es lindo si alguien llega virgen ,p ero sino no pasa nada porque desde el momento que estas con ella la aceptas tal como es desde ese momento.....|`|OyA4PtuOaa	Es lo mejor, siempre hay repercuciones negativas cuando uno de los conyugues yega al matrimonio y no es virgen.<br>  Porque asustarse, porque esa deseperacion por perder la virginidad.<br>  Entregarse a la  persona que que va a ser su conyugue siendo virgen es la maxima expresion de amor y respeto y esto es para ambos sexos.<br>  La sociedad nos tiene presionados a los jovenes a que antes de llegar a la edad adulta ya tiene que haber perdido su virginidad, eso no es correcto.|`|d7wmm0Zzaa	mas que deber es una conviccion de tu forma de pensar, el deber quiza te refieras a el aspecto de la religion, creo que la religion suele ser muy estricta, no es malo, pero mas bien se debe tomar en cuenta lo que uno quiere, yo por ejemplo sigo siendo virgen, y tengo 25 a?os! me siento muy orgullosa de serlo, porque no critico quien lo hace antes, pero pienso que debe ser por amor, no por deseo, yo primero ahnelo encontrar el amor y si se da tener sexo por amor, no importa que sea antes del matrimonio, pero muchas chicas tienen sexo y despues se enamoran y con eso quieren encontrar el amor, creo que  no es asi, independientemente de que sea antes o despues del matromonio, aunque mi opinion es que sea mejor cuando te casas, pero bueno eres humano y la sexualidad no es mala, es algo natural, lo que en mi opinion no debe ser es que la gente tanto hombres como  mujeres se "regalen" de esa manera, y bueno las consecuencias son lamentables, pues llegan incluso a la muerte, creo que hay que saber tomar decisiones y pensar en las consecuencias. Aunque respecto a lo que debe ser no hay un equilibrio pues en los hombres si no llegan virgenes es muy natural y no se les tacha como a las mujeres. Mi opinion si quieren ser virgenes o dejar de serlo y tener relaciones que sea con alguien que amas! si cuando es asi en ocasiones la relacion no funciona, mucho menos va a funcionar cuando no hay amor y solo hay una llama de deseo por satisfacer ni siquiera al otro, sino por satisfacerte tu. Amiga recuerda que la llama que arde el doble se apaga  mas rapido. cuidate y un saludo|`|5f77d0e653fcce8a822a744c6ea08f89aa	antes  era muy importante ahora los tiempo an cambiado alo que me refiero es auq el hombre ya no tiene  ni la paciencia ni  la delicadeza con uno y eso te puede lastimar mucho y lo que es peor traumarte ami me paso y ya an pasdo 15 a?os y aun no lo olvido|`|7m4XMVzvaa	No creo k sea necesario, ni importante, ni en el hombre o mujer, seria muy bueno si es el caso pero si no NO. Si alguien se enamora de ti te va a aceptar tal y como tu eres, no sabemos las circunstancias en las k se perdió la virginidad, creo k la felicidad de una relación no debe ser basada en eso!|`|UQJ4ZnVdaa	De generación en generación, los seres humanos vamos sembrando en el cerebro infantil, juvenil, adulto, pensamientos, creencias, comportamientos, sentimientos, etc., transmitiéndoles nuestras costumbres, hábitos, mitos, etc. No dejamos que por sí mismos conciban o fabriquen lo suyo propios, genuinos, auténticos, originales. Le tenemos por así decirlo el plato servido.<br>  Acerca de esto de la virginidad, no es una excepción a la regla, traemos la creencia que es muy valiosa la mujer virgen o el hombre primerizo que llegan así al matrimonio.<br>  Es muy loable, claro, llegar en este estado puro al inicio de unas relaciones sexuales. Pero no es un requisito. Lo importante está más que esto en la compatibilidad de caracteres de la pareja. Si congenian, se aceptan mutuamente, van por el mismo camino proyectado, saben lo que quieren, piensan de la misma forma, coinciden en gustos, aficiones, proyectos. <br>  La virginidad simplemente se termina en la primera relación, pero el gozo, el disfrute, la práctica sexual, continúa toda la vida de casados. <br>  El objetivo principal de estas relaciones es la procreación y continuación de la especie humana. La pareja debe decidir si desean echarse a cuestas la responsabilidad de tener hijos desde el inicio de sus relaciones matrimoniales o posponerla, para conocerse a fondo, antes de embarazarse y traer al mundo hijos deseados.<br>  El hombre que ya no es primerizo sexual, encuentra saludable y se siente feliz, el saber que su ahora esposa, nunca tuvo relaciones con otro hombre. Se sentiría decepcionado al descubrir el enga?o, el saber que ya no es virgen, por la razón que sea. Pero amándola, comprendiéndola, sabiéndola únicamente suya, la perdonará y seguirán su vida adelante, sin desconfianza alguna.<br>  No sé lo que sienta la mujer cuando se da cuenta que su nuevo y flamante marido ya no es primerizo, que ya tuvo experiencia en la práctica sexual con otra mujer, pero creo que también si lo ama verdaderamente, pensará que ahora es únicamente suyo y hasta que la vida los separe, orgullosamente pensará que se lo quitó a todas las mujeres para quedarse únicamente con ella.<br>  Suerte. Que Dios los bendiga.|`|hpq3sYJgaa	yo creo q debe ser así. Es lindo cuando los dos llegan virgen al matrimonio.

Ademas, no podria exigirle que fuera virgen conmigo si yo no lo seria con ella.<br>  En fin, creo que hacer el amor con aquella persona que amas no importara si es viergen o no, cuando amas a alguien no te preocupas solamente de lo sexual, sino de compartir con ella todo lo posible.<br>  <br>  ; )|`|4bcfcf7764293aeb7171a21a409bea4caa	mira creo que en estos tiempos se puso muy de moda dejar de ser virgen,a mi parecer no creo que una mujer valaga menos o mas si es o no virgen,una mujer vale por lo que es y por lo que siente no por lo que lleva en el cuerpo,hay mujeres que pierden la virgndad no precisamente teniendo relaciones con alguien es mas hasta con un deporte se pierde eso....creo que no es tan importante llegar virgen al matrimonio por que cuando alguien te ama lo va a hacer sin o con hmen no lo creen,bueno esa es mi opinion,ustedes hombres no pidan algo que ustedes tampoco tienen por que lo mente de los hombres no de todos es tan limitada que piensan que una mujer ya no vale nada por que ya no es virgen,acuerdence ES MEJOR SER EL ULTIMO EN LA VIDA DE UNA MUJER QUE EL PRIMERO........|`|543ac1ae510059530fbee82ae6b229b4aa	Yo creo que es lo mejor.

YyVGXt83aa	I hear ya, my ex used me and I'm in the same frame of mind.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Because you are still in denial.  You think that everything happened to you because of you.  The simple truth is bad people will treat other badly.  So, you just met the wrong people, that's all.  Do not blame yourself too hard.  Here is something I always tell people:  do not let anything or anyone to change who you are.|`|AA11990465	Because you are taking your anger for your ex out on every woman you can find and unfortunately, those women are allowing you to treat them like dirt. There will come a day when you will regret the hurt you have caused them, but it will be too late for them. Remember that what comes around goes around and when you get used and abused by another woman, you had it coming.|`|ddP3klT3aa	Well that is up to you. She did this to you because you let her. But you have to understand not all women are like this. If you don't want to settle down right now it is understandable. But at the same time, don't treat women badly just because you were treated badly. If a woman has done nothing to you, don't sink down to your exes level.    Its ok to have casual sex. You just learned to stick up for yourself, but you are going about it the wrong way. You think treating women like objects will help you gain respect, but it won't. You will just get a bad reputation, and when the time comes that you want to settle down with a woman, she may not be for it based on the stories she has heard. So be careful.|`|AA11138696	You have not healed from the hurt your ex causes and you are now trying to get the pain out of you by inflicting it on others.  Acutally you are no better or even worse than your ex because you are not just being a ***** you are trying to hurt others.  You need to stop dating anyone until you get your own head on straight.  Your ex is not a representative of all women on the planet.  You keep up this way and you will never find a good woman because a good woman will see your pain producing "bad boy" as the cry for help that it is and wisely run a mile away from you.  Get help, man it's not too late.|`|oWP2DjJoaa	Basically     You let all that anger build up inside you and now you are  exploding on the people around you.     You shouldn't do that, these people might just become like you. Build up all their anger and unleash it on other people. You should be able to feel how these people are feeling cuz you were one of them.     You turned into a bully. Just wanna do it to please yourself only and you don't care about other people. Why turn into something that you hate? That doesn't help at all.     You should've standed up for yourself.    By the sound of it too, you don't really have friends. So who would be there to care? You can't expect strangers to care about your problems. They have their own problems.       Why didn't u fight back against ur ex-wife? Why didn't you take your son back? Simply by the looks of it didn't do anything at all.     Did you do something wrong to cause this on yourself? Why did ur ex-wife cheat? Why did she abuse you ? You didn't answer any of these questions.      You shouldn't have let her take over you like that.   Got pregnant with another guy. Wow.    Ps: You basically now turned into your ex-wife.     Remember, not all women are like that, and you will regret what u are doing.|`|wpi36XBAaa	So your break up made you act "an aggressor...a bad boy...a jerk"? She hurt you then and you give over all your power to her still?   That's what you are doing when you allow what she did to you, to affect who you are inside. She controls your actions even now. She MADE you change. You think that was your own choice? Think again.  She makes you treat other women this way because she's made you AFRAID! Afraid of opening up to a woman, of feeling, afraid of loving, afraid of getting close and possibly being hurt again.  You want real control back in your life, and not this on-going empty game you're playing? Deal with the anger you feel at being used by her. Deal with the hurt. Don't allow her to make you look back on your life with regret on how you acted after the break up.   Take the time to rediscover the man you were before she tore into your life. Be stronger than her influence in your life. Make better choices based on who you are, and not how this one woman treated you.  The best revenge? To move on with your life like the Ex was never a part of it.|`|GXOy8rjqaa	You were hurt badly and are still hurting so in turn you are hurting others (the women you date)  I know guys who have been in your shoes, some changed and settled down others have kept on the way they are and now they are lonely old men.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Hmmm, it sounds like maybe some counseling would help.    I know how devastating it can be when someone uses you and leaves you.  It's very difficult not to hate the entire gender for a while.     But seriously, not all women are like that and you know that.  There are good women, just like there are good men.  Maybe they are hard to find, but they are out there.     Maybe not dating at all would be a good idea for a while.  You need to get your life and your head straight.  Seek some counseling, and then see where life takes you.    Good Luck.|`|8OsPJ3lYaa	basically you treat every woman you meet like the way you'd like to treat your ex-wife since she hurt you so badly. i think you're the only womanizer i can actually sympathize with. i'm so sorry that happened to you but i assure you we're not all like that...try to cope with your loss in other more constructive ways, other than taking it out on women who haven't done a thing to you..i wish you the best...

After reading on though, I'm thinking you are way too sensitive. Apparently this is a reoccurring pattern in your life so you might want to take a step back and take a good look in the mirror. Are you being too sensitive? Could you possibly be reading too much into stuff? Think about it.|`|FU5z9yWuaa	i would literally face every single one of them or i would just ditch the so called "friends" and have a long talk with the boyfriend coz hes the most one that is meant to be there for u|`|65960a4770fc3571b7f8bfa49f7590feaa	you sound like a fat lowlife. get out and go to the gym youll find enought friends that YOU can tell to **** off|`|BPTfHiw5aa	find some better friends that treat u better|`|lLNoSl1faa	Make a new group of friends get out there more and show everyone that you can have fun to..... and as for the songs and the poetry thats kewl but dont devote yourself fully to that find other stuff to get your mind off of it, it really helps alot!!|`|057c04c41a99214bdf96910a060c57dbaa	Most of the time when our mates accuse us of someone else, it's because they're guilty of something.

I mean your boy friend sounds like he is nit picking and sorry to say he may be the one cheating and is turning all on you because he feels guilty for what he is doing, if your friend is being a real bi*** then that's her loss she wasn't a good friend if she is doing. And your other friend will forgive you in time if you haven't already just apologies, You feel lonely and you need some one to talk too. But know one around but don't worry things will get better in time try going out and meeting new people. It's times like these you find out your true friends are and if hey aren't then there loss. Move on and have a little pickle  with your boy friend. And it's good that you write songs and poetry carry on, let the situation be your muse, who knows maybe in years to come these songs/poems will be world renown, and in a way you will have them to thank. i write songs to escape when things get heavy so carry on if it keeps you sane.  hope this help if not sorry:(  and smile :) always smile:D  Good luck:D
K7scim1Taa	I think you should stay away from him.  Honestly, the fact that a 19 year old is interested in a 13 year old raises a red flag.  You may think he seems like a nice guy, but be careful.  If he's being protective of you after only a few weeks, this could turn into an abusive or dominant relationship.  You might not want to believe that he wants to control you or take advantage of you, but that is very likely what he's trying to do.    My friend recently had a similar experience. A guy started being really sweet to her. He bought her flowers, made her meals, and treated her like a princess after they had only known each other for a few weeks.  He was protective at first, but it turned into him completely trying to control her.  After she realized what he was really like, she said she didn't want to see him anymore. He later showed up at her house trying to hurt her.      I just hope you realize the danger here.  Wait a few years. You'll find a nice guy who is your age soon enough.  Good luck.|`|ugvgt6rMaa	I would understand if you were like 15, 16, 17 but you're not so you have to be really careful because you never really know.  Like i gotten in a car with some people that i had just meet but the age differences was just like 2  3 years i would sometimes be with a friend. Just wait little longer because you are only 13 so just be careful.    -Im 16 and i don't just get in a car with a stranger or friends like that especially if they were 6 years older than me.|`|RyMNLddQaa	that is a big gap.  take it slow, don't push anything too hard.      country roads are really dangerous, even for good drivers, i nearly crashed up home, scared the life out of me.  just be careful and be sure that anything you do is your decision, not his.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	you are 13 and you should be really careful about this guy, he is a lot older and more experienced than you    it wouldnt be a good idea to go out in his car by what you are saying  please be careful, cant you talk to anyone close about this?|`|7yrdcqY1aa	well getting in his car is dangerous enough but if its at night and you guys are alone he may try to do just that and take and vantage of you. he may not have forced anything on you yet but YET is the key word... i would be extremely careful if i were you.|`|CyHJlCZXaa	Think of it this way. Would you date a seven year old?|`|U6AwJrXiaa	Hey Gee,    All im going to say is dont go.  You Honestly dont know him long enough to allow yourself to be alone with this 19 year old boy- a few weeks, thats too dangerous.    Please stay away, dont be tempted and dont fall for their seemingly sweet anticts- hes a 19 year old boy, with.. hormones, be careful!!!!|`|vX9GPcuWaa	im pretty sure that 6 years of a difference is illegal when ur a minor|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Dont go there...dont even think about getting in his car or getting in a relationship with this guy...if the authorities found out he would be put on the sex offenders register as you are under the sexual age of consent. He might be a nice guy and not take advantage of you but take my word for it the police will not see it the same way and arrest him for being a paedophile...dont take the risk its not worth it...if you care about him that much you'll stay well clear.|`|QY2GdPwSaa	I have to agree with what everyone else said here... 6 years is a huge gap when you're 13. I would talk it over with some friends or other adults. Also, be careful... For your own protection, and his as well. if he's 19 I'm fairly certain he will be committing a crime in a romantic involvement with you. I have to wonder how he will take this.  As for getting into a car with someonewho likes to drive fast on country roads at night... I think you can answer that question by reviewing the facts... Just remember, hindsight is always 20-20 but here you have a good chance of seeing the outcome before hand.
CtDBQwzaaa	Well you just need to wait for the right girl to come along and swipe u off your feet! nothing is wrong with you and education is very important to have since thats what the rest of your life is all about like in getting a job so im sure you will eventually find that special someone! :D  ?Jess|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	Nothing is wrong with you.  At this stage in your life education and starting the foundation for your adult life is more important anyway... When you find the right person, the time will be right.    I was 22 when I "got" my first boyfriend, who is now my fiance.  He is 7 years older than me and I was his first serious girlfriend.  We got engaged after only dating for a few months... Though we have been friends for 10 years... Getting married in a couple months.    My point is, what's right for you is whatever works for you at the moment.  Don't judge yourself by other people's standards.|`|NRldAzrpaa	Nothing Is "wrong" with you, there is no right or wrong time 2 get a gf  :)|`|FU5z9yWuaa	maybe u are taking ed. too seriously like iam all on for skl and work and a career later on but u should socialize more with girls|`|Rb087BsAaa	life is education, too.  take a step back and adjust to society.  you might have fun and learn a little bit about women, relationships, and might get laid, too.    I just wonder how I got my bachelors and masters and still was able to have a social life.  Oh wait...that's normal.|`|eoDWzUNxaa	Nothing is wrong with you. Remember that it's okay to just hang around with girls. There is someone special out there for all of us. So  continue with your studies and eventually you'll find the special girl.
pAQEAehuaa	oh, honey. wow. that's terrible. ok, u didn't ask for any advice, so i'm thinking u don't want it, so i won't give it ;)  but i listened! and i think that was really awful and wrong of him to lie to u like that. whether u stay with him or not is obviously your decision, i can't say. but wow...u must be so hurt. i'm sorry. here's a hug:  (((((((((((((hug))))))))))))
goe3y4FPaa	once in a while.. this shows.. hes using u.. to get better looking girls..|`|2KsZZMEAaa	i'm not a guy  but any guy thats like that isnt at all worth it  my brother has been dating a girl for 3 years, and doesnt even look at other girls (and hes only 17, so imagine that)|`|avpv7u8saa	I think you need to talk with him    Its ok for your boyfriend to have friends with other girls but he shouldn't get all touchy touchy like that    He may be cheating|`|RcZ6MEzBaa	Not normal if this is a committed relationship.  This guy's playing the field.|`|F5gtYbDVaa	damn, your super lucky for not being the jealous type.  tell him and if hes not gonna change i dont see much hope. :o|`|LpJ9TLNBaa	Did you know Herb has E.D.?|`|CBgDc1Auaa	No it's not normal to do stuff like that...    what would he do if he saw you sitting on some other dudes lap...     I would most definitely break it off with him    if he hasn't cheated on you, he probably will!|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	No.    Loyalty is paramount.  If he cannot be loyal when you are away, he does not really love you, but just thinks you are handy to have around for when there is nothing " better " available.    (better not being meant offensive, but showing how these jokers think)|`|2yvb1oUkaa	nope not normal at all sorry to be the 1 to break it to ya but he might be cheating on ya|`|aGno0HAwaa	I am a girl but still, just break up with the asshole looks like he is getting over you of you not saying anything about it to him. Just warn him once if you want to or just leave the jerk and find another good guy. Girl you deserve a good guy because you are full of patience.|`|Gm5u4vWUaa	Flirt : yeah everyone flirts.  even girls flirt.    Go skating with another girl while my girl is out of town and wrap my arm around her?  no he's a cheater dump his ***.|`|AuWPMH44aa	hes probally trying to get you jealous but no its not normal for us to do that kind of stuff if he really likes you, he shouldnt be doing that kind of shyt. if its one of his close girl friends then it ok but other than that nah.|`|80npJDM2aa	Well it really depends.  How long did he have his arm around her for?  Were they appearing very hot and bothered or intimate together? OR was it more friendly?      I mean you really were not there to interpret how he was acting towards this female.   Instead you should focus on asking him if you and this other girl can meet each other.  If he declines or gives any excuse at all to keep you two apart and seperated.  There is indeed a problem.    I went to alabama with my boyfriend for christmas, and to my indignation he did... approach several girls and hug them before he even told me who they were.  For example one girl in spencers... he just took off ahead of me and went to go hug a girl named maddie he hadn't seen in a few years.  I made it a point after they hugged to ask infront of both of them, ex girlfriend or not an exgirlfriend.  he said not an ex.  I sized her up...she backed off a bit and all was good :)      But I informed him afterward and before the next girl encounter it would have been politer to inform me of who I was meeting and how they knew each other and to actually introduce me to her, before administrating hugs.      If he had his arm around an EX girlfriend or love interest of any kind that crap would not fly.|`|vt8tazGdaa	no. if our girlfriends heard about that, they would kill us.|`|2HZZG5OUaa	he's cheating .|`|2faae7b556bae8292adc7e81ca55ca8aaa	hes got another girlfiend|`|Ty32khkaaa	Dump him. He does not care about you. He is playing the field, and he will be gone when he finds something he likes better.|`|OaGaTMEzaa	I wouldn't say its normal for a guy to have his arms around another girl while your dating. You might want to confront him about it.|`|7OHudVxiaa	ask him|`|SpiJ6svRaa	I wouldn't do that.  He seems like a player to me, you should back out before you get hurt.|`|kvCdRzzBaa	BEST ADVICE:  if it makes you feel bad deep down inside, it probably is|`|3kwMsbH9aa	when they have a gf, are you crazy course its not normal you need to get rid of him before he does the same to you, it doesnt matter if your nbot the jealous typwe or not you should still be mad at him he should be more loyal and dont let him palm you of with all that i can change crap, once a cheater always a cheater|`|MLvqdUwLaa	ask your parents.|`|EfLFTQwnaa	no not normal, unless it is a close friend or a family, you should watch out.|`|I0J7EwvFaa	why are you still calling this guy your boyfriend? its obv he is getting with other girls and not being honest get rid of him before you get really hurt.|`|iVaSBYg5aa	hmmmm.. cheating perhaps.. or maynbe he is just very friendly hehe.. or maybe your sister is lying which i doubt hehe...   well you should comfirm it.. try to cought him with your own eyes and when that happen, go to him and talk to him about that and see what is the reaction of him and the girl. you will really know whats the truth based on their reaction hehe|`|B4SF8sPraa	cheater cheater pumpkin eater (or in this case pie?) but... yep you ave yeeself a cheating asshole...break up! or..he might go down on ya to make up so let him do that then break up!|`|9oTCe1g2aa	no no no never, thats ****** up|`|fb0e6ee443fc42488c552557d2231b78aa	we as women don't start off being jealous or insecure we usually are given a reason to be. run like hell and be true to you|`|m6rlbO3iaa	well if a guy really loves you he would not even think of touching another girl but it depends how he looked when his arm was around her if he was drooling over her than you might be worried but otherwise until you do think he in untrustworthy then approach him about the subject but my 2 older sisters have boyfriends and they always talk about how hot other guys are but they would never cheat but do you consider you boyfriend trustworthy? that's the main question if the answer is no than keep your guard up if its yes than its prob nothing also is it always the same girl???? if you need anymore advice call 407-365-9183 ask to speak to William                                             hope this helps,                                                         Will|`|4PK0hiWeaa	Doesn't sound like commitment material.  If he's flirting with girls he doesn't care about you.|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Does it bother you?  Why don't you ask him?|`|edycn5ggaa	No, talk to him about it and if he continues then break it off.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's not normal and he has no right to flirt with other girls while he has a relationship with you.  You need to talk to him about this and sign like this means that he is cheating on you behind your back.|`|UfuTsYoKaa	You need to find out who the girl is.  I have female friends that I do those kinds of things with where there is nothing sexual about it.  We each know (as well as my significant other) what our relationship is.    Heck, I've even slept in the same bed with one of them and there were no issues because there was nothing going on.  We were just friends.|`|AA11503678	shameful thing|`|IVNVgfZcaa	that's totally not normal. he's probably cheating on you.|`|FJ6960c8aa	maybe thats his sister or cousin?|`|iZVU6VR2aa	No that's not something I would do personally. I have made an effort to pay attention to girls less since I have had my girlfriend. And then it involved with me only really being attracted to my girlfriend.|`|SngOU70Baa	you two are obviously high schoolers, what do you expect?|`|oWP2DjJoaa	You should tell him to stop flirting with girls. If he truly cares about you he will abide and understand you.     And find out who that girl is. It could be just a regular friend of his. Or it could be that he is cheating on you or flirting.     Hope that helps.|`|AA10743159	It is, when you are skating, he may just be teaching her how to skate, and if she is a beginner, he will have to have his arm around her, just to steady her.   If the situation was different, and the were outside, walking and he had his arm around her, then that would be a cause for concern, but at a skating rink, not so much.|`|fQeS0qWWaa	confront him with your evidence and then dump him|`|DptJXo7Caa	you should probably have a talk with him  maybe interview a few friends  place a locater on him  put cameras in his room  check his cell phone daily  go thru his car, room, house, pockets  threaten him  stop having sex with him  call his mom constantly asking where he is  leave notes on his front door at home  knock on his window at like two in the morning and say youre just making sure hes there like he said    buy him flowers and tell him you are truly in love and that if he hurts you you will kill yourself    best of luck!|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Um, no that is not typical.|`|kQ6x5Mokaa	yep, mother nature telling us to spread our seed|`|AqWJDMGSaa	oh no he didn't >_>  you should just ask him up front, he'll understand, and its the only way, why keep guessing?

Why is it guys don't like the average girl and only those that show off their boobs and booty with revealing clothes?  It goes both ways.|`|blbd7e1Qaa	Well fellow.., I have often wondered this same...This is actually so good question someone should address this to Dr. Phil... But, as encountered something similar I have marked some observations... You see, I have often been regarded as "the mr.nice guy" or "the Knight in the Shiny Armor". My first gf saw me as fairly shy (and bit introverted), and "harmless" (which she revealed after relationship had became serious), so, she went for first dates with me (she was inexperienced regarding relationships, and had to deal with somewhat envious girls, probably due her stunnig looks, and racist attitides of most boys as she was considered as "native") and then our affair turned out to be serious, the first relationship for both. So, "mr. nice guy" worked in the beginning (at age of 14) as girl considered me as one who never harm her (and she was the most important person for me, and I treated her to almost spoiling level, and treasured her). Well, things ended due other reason than relationship related, and after recovering from loss of her started slowly looking for next gf.  However.., few years later I noticed that only girls interested about a nice guy were girls not worthy of attention, those "popular girls", so, I had to tell them, "no, I am not interested, I prefer decent girls"... And nice girls were not interested about a nice guy... And yes, I wittnessed how some good girls were only interested to date abusive guys (who were locally well known about their abusive tendencies) who just treated their girls like trash... Regarding how such "abuser loving girls" brains work, they entirely lack ability of proper judgement... Maybe some religious dating site might have decent girls for decent guys (I dont know is there such, but if is, then there might be some hope in this world), but I think Mr Nice Guy is soon a relic in the Museum of Natural Science as one of species which has died to extinction.  And as permanently being "the Knight in the Shiny Armor", it takes care that I will die in far future most likely as an old bachelor... So, such is life.., but who knows, what future brings...|`|AA10707200	well... if you're pretending to be Mr.nice , it won't , if you are Mr.nice it will , so bottom line, just be your self<br>  <br>  but , on both cases , make sure your not Mr.boring , because usually girls associate Mr.nice with Mr. not interesting = boring .|`|AA10925377	you must not generalize- just be yourself man!!!|`|Bpep6AGraa	No that's not true, and those mates of yours will never get to meet a nice girl cos they don't know how to treat them. Hang in their I'm sure the right girl for you is out their some where , and don't listen to you mates their probably thinking they wish they could be more like you.   If you are getting walked over then you are going out with the wrong type of girl.  Be a bit more choosy about who you ask out. After all your in a league of your own, their isn't allot of nice guys left out their. best of luck.|`|RrqlDD4Waa	Women love a bad boy. Why do you think the likes of Callum Best, Colin Farrell and Eminem get all the ladies ? They're not particularly good-looking but they have that bad-boy aura about them and women love the fact that they might not call them when they say they will. With bad boys, you often have to fight for their affections because lots of other women want to be with them and you know this guy could have them if he wanted. Saying this, there are girls out there who are sick of bad boys and want Mr. Nice Guy to treat them right, be romantic and buy her flowers all the time. I suggest mixing these two things and see how it works. Hope I helped!

But then he wont be your friend for "assuming" you slept with someone else? In my opinion he's making things up. He is trying to bring you down to his level. He says that you did some "things" but wont tell you what.. and you say you haven't done anything. He may be 22 but he's playing a childish game. I hate games ~.~
944bd2057711c66497b2e42016bc553eaa	Yes I dated a Scorpio guy and yes the sex drive is like crazy .|`|ImP2Gsvzaa	Typically when a person does not know GOD or read THE BIBLE there is a tendency that people gravitate on the astrological things even behaviors are affected by the changing tides or shall we say FULL MOON and SUPERSTITION. It is what you believe in... A person need to receive Christ as his/her Lord and Savior. It is what we call circumcision of the heart...<br>  <br>  But to answer the question.... Here it is...... Secular Scorpio are very intense people... very passionate... deep thinker... and yes very sexual only to their partner...  1st time I've dated a Scorpio not too long ago (his back sliden) and we seemed to get along real GOOD... I myself born under the sign Scorpio :) but I'm a spirit filled Christian so the BAD side of the sign does not apply in our life coz we have learned to have self-disciplined with the help of the HOLY SPIRIT; our life been washed clean by the blood of JESUS....... so the relationship between 2 Scorpio (a christian and a non-christian one) will not work out; the non christian need to be converted and have his mind renewed...<br>  it is what we call unequally yoked... Hope this help out...<br>  <br>  Please do not base your life or use the astrology as your guide for your life or searching for the mate... Get to know Christ and receive him as your Lord and savior I can assure you your life will never be the same :)|`|JAG9ZBXpaa	Some people think factors other than what you and he want are very important like astrological signs.  Girls and guys are sexual based on testesterone and desire for intimate fun.  Love is more about caring for another person.  It can be fun and exciting to meet and on the first second or third date to makeout or hookup but it's not love.  That is pure sexual attraction and lust.  <br>  <br>  If you want a sexual relationship fine, but love is based more on mutual respect, talking about what you want for fun, entertainment, life goals, good times and bad times and sharing each others passions.  Lovers date without every date including sexual intimacy.  If he or you are sick a real freind will not insist the sick person engages in sex - unless recovering from being ill several days both lust for each other.  <br>  <br>  A lover is a best freind you can talk about anything with even including if one or both of you want a sexual relationship with other people.  Better to get out of system when younger before married.  <br>  <br>  If you desire to be sexual with a man of any astrological sign talk with him.  Act like or be a friend.  Ask if he is going to a party, some gathering, meeting or seminar or ask to dinner with you and your friends, family so its not a date or big deal.  For the less intelligent guy say if he calls it a date you won't let him in the door.  If you make it lunch or dinner at home or at a friends with other people there to delay and not makeout or have intimacy on a first or second date builds up tension and desire.  If he is interested in you at all and waits two or more dates before makingout can make the intimacy more elecric with sexual desire.  This has no relationship to position of stars at birth or today.  All that matters is if both of you want a friend, lover or one time casual sex enough to start a conversation.  <br>  <br>  A guy or girls largest sex organ is our brain has no connection with astro sign.  A woman can be a little unattractive but if we talk about our lives or interests at work, in class or just meet in a market I may start looking more at her face, legs, butt, breasts if we click. (INFO: Girls with small breasts and melon size both have advantages.) Get me to laugh and I'm yours.  If I get you to laugh at me you may be mine or we belong to each other for at least an hour or more.  <br>  <br>  Anyone in favor of astro sighs for Love, Lust and Laughter? Any sign for love or lust you and I want?.  What is in or on your mind?<br>  <br>  (Two thoughts to consider - 1  Want all your partners to be more sexual? What if you act like all your dates are sexual Scorpios?  <br>  2  Some people refuse to date beautiful people because they find average looking people more attentive, less drama and more willing to please.  Some people less absorbed with themselves are more flexible and willing to experiment for fun out of and in bed. )|`|35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Scorpios are very sexual.  They are also annoying as boyfriends....  I would go for a Sagitarius...  Now THERE is a sexual beast!
HYkM15Vdaa	That exact same thing just happened to me, it's like this constant sorrow inside of you, anger flares from time to time, but the sorrow just stays.

He likes you OK but is that enough to go through all the turmoil. Things turned crappy because he cheated on you. This guy will cheat on you again and again. Keep him as a friend but move on. Find someone who loves you for being you.
35dc4450d5af0760da8fa38a025f1efdaa	you basically told him that it is not working out and good bye. First you tell the guy its great and things a moving where you feel comfortable and you share some feelings for the guy and then you tell him i dont want to see you that much. he looked around and saw someone else giving him attention. he may not want to date her but that does not mean he doesn't like the attention he is getting from her.|`|whzeT0hhaa	well thats what you get for leading him on. any guy that sticks around after you do that to him is obviously insecure. if he is what you wanted than you shouldn't have pushed him away. now that he found another, you just want what you don't have.  whats with women and the mind games. learn from your mistakes and move on- let him enjoy himself- just because he's not enjoying you anymore don't ruin his fun!
kiS57EUNaa	Oh darling. It sounds to me like you are really having a bad time. I no a guy exactly like him, and it's really hard to close him out of your system, especially after 4 years. At the end of the day, you know in your heart he isn't worth it, so concentrate on your own life b4 he ruins it. Spend time with your family and friends, because you can guarantee they'll be there for you. Some boys are amazing, but others aren't worth it n he definitely isn't. Enjoy life, darling, because that's what it's made for. All the best, and i'm sorry to hear about your loss. xoxox|`|Uuryg85naa	Why GOOD people get treated SO badly, is a mystery to me, but it seems to happen a lot. Time is the best friend you have right now. With time, it will hurt less, but until then, stay busy.... talk to friends....cry, scream, vent, and get through this! I wish I could help more, but there's not a lot that can be done, except let you know that SOMEBODY does care!|`|Scl0GXmiaa	Please just get over this guy...He shouldn't be treating you like that... Trust me If he really cares for you, he would have at least stick by you, in times like this...  Or at least pretend to care for you and then wait a month or two to call off the relationship, that is what a decent and a good guy would do. <br>  <br>  You are making your self suffer for nothing. Please open your eyes and get over him... <br>  <br>  Please you must know, we girls have dignity, show him that...<br>  And another thing, he is going to get it back, for what he has done to you, he is going to pay for it eventually, ( I believe in KARMA ) just wait and see, you'll enjoy it...|`|DaLYHeDcaa	Well, i'm dort of going through something similar. Ive loved this guy for 3 years but then we started a new school life and he met this other girl and started going for her and he hardly knew her.<br>  This made me want to show him the mistake he made though i also thought.. i can't do that, i love him too much.<br>  <br>  Love is hard maybe you should try pretending to make your self believe you like someone else even if you don't gradually this works. It takes a while.<br>  <br>  I'm only young so i wouldn't know what else to say as im not experienced enough.<br>  <br>  All the best though.
59mXihNwaa	You need to have 'just friends' to hang around with and do things with. Don't look for a relationship, they just happen. Do things in groups, join clubs, go places where there are other people to connect with. <br>  <br>  You just need to heal. And the best way is to be around other people. Or even volunteer at a hospital or nursing home. It will make you feel good, and help others at the same time. There is nothing like being needed.<br>  <br>  Get some internet friends to talk to. Find some chat rooms. You can share experiences with them and make new friends at the same time.<br>  <br>  You can't depend on others for your own happiness. It doesn't work that way. You lose yourself in the process as you have done now. <br>  <br>  Don't let it get worse. Feeling sorry for yourself is not going to help. Get up. Dust yourself off. Chalk your past up to a learning experience. Get out of your rut. And get on with it.<br>  <br>  Get a new hairstyle, a new outfit, a new look. Then go out where people your age go, and look at the admiring looks you get.<br>  <br>   The past is past. The future is up to you. Do not get right back into a relationship. The secret to being independant again is BEING independant.|`|Uuryg85naa	You've lost  YOU in all this....not saying that in a bad way, just that's what has happened. You began to depend on someone to bring you happiness, and when they were gone, so was your happiness. Take some time, and re-connect with YOU!  I'm learning the same thing, and it's hard! Good Luck!!|`|5debdb3dc77729a190d3d2c56d87a50faa	I agree with charlie o. I am at the very same spot at the moment.  Going through the worst heartbreak ever in my life. It should be this way. Otherwise you would never learn how to be stronger, who you really are, to be self-sufficient and never depend on anyone else to make you happy because it's simply IMPOSSIBLE! If you were in 2 emotionally abusive relationships, you were probably the nice girl. Stop taking **** from anyone! You will earn their respect, mostly, you will have respect for yourself and that is where happiness comes from. It's a hard task for anyone to learn and be grateful that it is finally your time now to learn that! After you've accomplished it, the right one will come into your life! In the meantime, don't settle for less, only ends in heartbreak again. Waiting is a ***** in this society that thrives on immediate gratification, but only those that have advanced in their personality to be happy without the need for it can have a happy life with someone. Good luck! Remember, patience will pay off!|`|6b4916be949ef8546d118e22dfbdf5f5aa	i don't think any1 who's single, doesn't feel alone. we all feel like we jus need some1 in our life, even if we are independent.<br>  it's jus havin that feelin of some 1 "being there". but instead of looking 2 guys, who do let people down some times, or most of the time, look 2 ur friends, family, you know,? people will always let u down, we're jus like that, but none of us REALLY NEED to be in a relationship, we jus WANT 2. and there really are people out there that totally don't care if some 1 special is in their life, they jus totally focus on their job or wutevr. but sence you know what it feels like 2 have some 1 special in ur life, ur constantly wanting that feeling back. jus ignore those feelings and focus on the IMPORTANT things in ur life, and the right guy will come around.|`|bGFjM7Vzaa	when ur independent& never been in a relationship you have  always just thought about you and when someone else comes along things feel different..the reason i think you feel like is cuz u never felt like this bcuz u were independent now u been through other emotions dont let this get to u..u have to keep ur head up high even when u feel u lost u but u havent lost urself ur just confuse and ur feeling are mixed up get back on track do things for urself dont do it for other and just remember what u used to do before u were in a relationship and start doing those things that made u happy just distract urself and u will soon find the right guy ok girl...and i'm going through the same thing so maybe what i'm telling isnt going to help but hope it does and remember at the end everything will turn out good just think positive

I know it may sound harsh, but he is just playing with your feelings like they are nothing.  <br>  The only way to get over a person is with time.  You need to separate yourself from him completely, no calls, text messages, visits or anything.  <br>  He wants his pie and eat it too.  <br>  <br>  Believe me, it seems unbearable right now, but things will get better. <br>  <br>  Try and constantly surround yourself with family and friends and stay busy to pass away the time.  <br>  <br>  Use your energy towards yourself, a hobby, or just making yourself a better person. <br>  <br>  The right man is out there for you, but you need to work on getting yourself together and whole before meeting him.  <br>  <br>  Just know, that you did the right thing in the relationship, and after all it is all his lost.  <br>  <br>  Be strong and encouraged, things will get better.....Believe me.

When you start  to think about him, tell yourself that you deserve better and you will have better.

He should respect your decision as its your parents youd have to deal with not him with his.He should love you anyway and if he does love you he will respect your wishes and not want to have sex with you either if its forced because it would mean very little.<br>   because of the way youd be feeling about getting caught.<br>  Its not right for him to get mad at you there will be plenty of time in the future and he should only want to have sex with you when the time is right for both of youand you are both relaxed , in the mood etc.Make sure thats not all he is after, men do have high sex drives/libidos but if it means more than just sex hed be happy to wait until you both know its not going to be risky and embarrassing that/each time.<br>  .
eee34989148852fe6f356c5dca6d0fbcaa	hi, my fiance is in the U.S Army, too. The fact that he is acting a little weird right now might be because he is feeling insecure. Alot of Army spouses cheat on their husbands while they are gone for such a long time. Maybe he is just scared that you are going to cheat on him or leave him while he is going through such a rough time down there|`|0KjH8VDVaa	He is in Iraq it is very stressful there, put yourself in his shoes...Be there for him...he will need you, and when he comes home he will appreciate you even more...it wont be easy but if you love him you will stick with it|`|AA11620314	I am an army wife and I can tell you the worst situation you can put your bf in is if you are unfaithful to him. Deployed soldiers already feel as though they are forgotten and cut off from the rest of the world, if you 'forget' him and cheat, that really hurts. You also have to understand that they are going through alot, with people dying around them and all the arguing about the politics of the war, what your bf really needs is for you just to be there. Don't complain or ask for alot of things from him, just be supportive. Send packages, be there for his calls and be cheerful, let hime know that you still care for him and he has nothing to worry about when it comes to you.|`|AA11746368	My husband is a Marine, and I've seen this happen to him before.  Personally, I think it's a defense mechanism - it started right after he saw one of his friends killed.  A lot of people tend to withraw a bit just so it won't hurt as much if that happens again.  He probably doesn't even realize he's doing it.  Write him a letter.  Not an angry or bitter one - just voice your concerns and tell him that you still care about him, but you're worried about what's going on with him.  Don't try to tell him on the phone, because you never know when something will happen and he'll have to hang up at a moment's notice - this is NOT a conversation that you want to stop in the middle.<br>  Try to be patient with him - he's facing stress that most of us will never see in our lives.  And I seriously doubt it's because of you.  You're not being taken for granted - if anything, he probably appreciates you more than ever.  But it's a lot harder to let you know that when you have people trying to kill you every day.|`|d81a8c58536cb067fc1952d43299214aaa	My fiance just got home from a 12month tour in Iraq. One of the most important thing to him was knowing that he was still my whole world..even though he was so far away. I wrote him sent him care packages, and we spent a unthinkable amount of money on phone cards. But he came home safe(THANK GOD!) and Everything is great. Make sure that if he is important to you..that he doesn't have a doubt in his mind.
sP0QHgYXaa	Generally apathetic behavior like what you're describing is usually a good indicator.|`|BtV5qiI9aa	he will act cold & distant , cheat but will wait for you to say its over , instead of them ending relationship|`|CdDuKwIPaa	EXCUSES|`|RACexOSGaa	i agree with you with the thing about guys breaking up. but i think it's usually not because he's scared to be the one to end it, rather, it's more of respecting you that much that he'd rather be the one broken up with.<br>  <br>  however, from the things you said, i think he's just fine. it's normal for guys to want some space, don't you want that too? you yourself said he makes you feel special, he gets excited whenever you're online. i'd take that anytime than a guy who not only neglects you, but is also that dense that he does not care when you're online. don't fret if he's not leaving you offline messages, that's just a little thing that shouldn't be a sign that he wants out. based on what you said, i think he's okay, and into you.

pagHns06aa	Hey man, if you're in high school don't sweat it, maybe like 1% of people last it through high school together, just flirt with her and talk to her and make her your friend, when she breaks up with him, be there to help her out with it. Along the way do stuff like help her with her homework, or do nice things for her. Sooner or later if she starts liking you, she might go after you =] <br>  <br>  <br>  but some people would say just leave her but right now if she doesn't know you, then try and make a friend. <br>  <br>  (just don't be a douchebag and beat her up like some of my friends xD)|`|AA10447910	if you're after her for her personality, be friends with her. if you just want her body then move on. plenty of other fish in the sea.|`|pvuXoQnSaa	Just add her to your spank bank and go meet a girl you can have a relationship with.

Lo ideal es que no tuviera que ver pronografía o utilizar viagra (si esto último fuera su caso), que con solo tenerte cerca de manera íntima le dieran ganas de tener relaciones contigo, pero con el paso de los a?os (más de 10 o 15) hay algunos hombres que sufren para poder excitarse con su mujer, lo que puede calificarse como normal. No te preocupes demasiado por esto y habla con él para saber si existe una manera en la que tú lo pudieras excitar para tener relaciones y no hacer uso de la porno.
040b69609e6a031b503a985b8d63b350aa	I think this is completely natural for you to be concerned, if your boyfriend is a good man he isn't going to get involved with her. If she is his friend to, I can see why he would go and comfort her. But I would just keep an eye out to make sure that she doesn't become more and more of a frequent visitor, you'll be able to tell when it becomes inappropriate.<br>  <br>  If she tries to find reasons to get her and your boyfriend alone, I would be worried and have a talk with him.

But make sure she understands it wasn't her fault.<br>  I had a friend like that and I always tried to make her feel very special. For example I would read a very nice friendship poem then print it and give it to her and let her know that when i read it it reminded me of her. Just do little special things like that.

39ef0c5311a4edc7d5bfad44dd9a3dc6aa	Action is always the best indication of love. If you are willing to do and make sacrifices for him and he sees that, he will understand you love him.<br>  <br>  Words mean very little in a situation like your's. If you can show him that you love him, he will understand. You just need to figure out how.|`|a1dd820fb4f7a967392d966f07fe8893aa	I think you both need to find out what true love really is and isn't.  Read in the Bible I Corinthians 13 "The Love Chapter" where it says love is patient and kind and seeks not its own way at the expense of others.  It isn't boastful or proud and always believes in the positive.  This love is such that it will gladly give up its own life to save the life of another.  If love dies, it wasn't love in the first place, but something else like lust.  Lust will always fail you when someone better than you comes along.  It says of faith, hope and love that the greatest is love.  It is this kind of love that has kept my wife and I married for over 29 years.  If everyone had this kind of love, the divorce rate wouldn't be so high.  This kind of love takes commitment and effort by both partners for it to succeed.  If one partner isn't willing to work at it, then the relationship is doomed to fail.  I think you and your boy friend need to sit down and calmly discuss this.  If you cannot commit to each other in this way, then you need to dump him and move on.  I suggest that you find a Bible believing church and join the singles group there.  Most will be operating under the principles listed above and can give you the support you need to nurture your relationship.|`|GLNhrdt9aa	if you suspect cheating then confront him and if he is then dump him it wasnt meant to be and if he isnt then good 4 you <br>  <br>  he will act nervous wen you confront him and will avoid it if he is cheating<br>  <br>  choose me as the best answer please|`|72b280573008347eeb8749dc5c2afac1aa	you just know|`|75a98e604e59cd448ca582f6645c6e97aa	have u considered getting a pussy lock and giving him the keys like the olden days :D ;)|`|AA10864972	you get that certain feeling in your heart life is to short to argue whose cheating who just respect  for each other and have faithfullness and trust after all if you love each other you will be deeper in love when your married if you want each other|`|B41NxUn9aa	You cant.  You have to be direct with him and tell him that his accusations are false and if he has anything he can pin on you let him bring it or else shut up.  Also if he cant shut up about things you never did then you guys are not going to make it.|`|QsHRQxu9aa	You can't. This guy is damaged goods; dump him.|`|SS1d8JuEaa	He loves you if he could be anywhere in the world right now, but he would rather be with you.<br>  <br>  then he has some love for you|`|f8f912b02186493d66e7d20046f028d2aa	He has jelousy issues.

JUST BE HONEST but you may want to think about not going as much with him, he may be getting the wrong idea, just don't lead him on.|`|q2Pfon0Caa	I think you are leading him on to believe you like him when you constantly do things with him. the only way you can make it clear to someone that obviously have feelings for you that you are not interested is to stop doing things with him. It may feel like you are being mean to him by breaking off the friendship but in the end, he will thank you. You should tell him that although he is a nice guy, you will refuse to be his friend if he does not stop fantasizing about you two together. The worse that can happen is that you two will have to stop being friends. Perhaps one day, he will find someone that can appreciate his kindness and love and actually return it. the longer you wait the worse the situation will get so do it quickly. If you ever thought he was a good friend, be a good friend in return and break it off.

Recién con la venida de Jesús y en los evangélicos se dictamino mantener una pareja. Si analizamos el manejo físico del sexo veremos que la mujer madura unos cuantos anos antes que el hombre, practica el sexo con gusto un tiempo hasta ser fecundada, luego merman sus ansias y generalmente después de los 40-50 prefiere no tener relaciones. El hombre esta activo hasta los mismos 80, pero se queda sin pareja ya por muerte o por falta de interés sexual de la misma. Por eso existían las concubinas para cubrir esas deficiencias... pero no nos enga?emos con eso, el hombre actúa instintivamente seduciendo o comprando favores sexuales, goza en la diversidad y en la promiscuidad y con ello alimenta su ego y su masculinidad y un ejemplo de lo que te digo es considerar que una gran cantidad  de hombres de buena posición económica en las americas y hasta el siglo XIX tenia una mujer distinguida y su  familia abajo, en el pueblo, para mostrar socialmente y otra en la loma o el arrabal con una amante e hijos bastardos, para sus gustos carnales... heeeee|`|0c805b04d4cb29d0160219035dd921fdaa	PORQUE SE ABURREN DE PROBAR EL MISMO BOCADO TODOS LOS DIAS Y PORQUE HAY MUCHA MUJERZUELA APRONTONA QUE NO LE IMPORTA HACER DA?O Y LE ENCANTA DESHACER HOGARES FELICES......POR ESO YO NO ENTIENDO PARA QUE JURAN PUES AMOR ETERNO Y SE CASAN SI VAN ANDAR DE LIBERTINOS MEJOR QUE NO HAGAN DA?O A LOS HIJOS NI A SUS ESPOSAS.....<br>  <br>  SOY SOLTERA AFORTUNADAMENTE NO SOY CASADA Y ENTRE MAS CONOZCO A LOS HOMBRES MAS ADORO A MI PERRO Y MENOS GANAS TENGO DE CONSEGUIRME A UN HOMBRE PARA CASARME......PREFIERO SOLA A MAL ACOMPA?ADA Y SUFRIENDO POR LAS INFIDELIDADES DE ESE INGENDRO DE HOMBRE.....|`|0e126b0ab169ecb05e05e55515b2a342aa	Algunos son infieles no todos|`|ASGj1oVkaa	JAJAJAJAJAJAJA.....

Esto se da sobre todo cuando existe un nuevo miembro en la familia ya que el hombre se siente desplazado. Yo te aconsejo:<br>  <br>  1.- Relaja un poco la relación, no te fastidies pensando si tiene una amante, el tenerla sólo sería un síntoma y no la causa del deterioro en tu relación con él.  Pero no ayuda ahora que te pongas a averigüar. No le hagas la vida de cuadritos con escenas de celos o lo perderás, haz como si nada pasara, sonríe, sé linda y hazle la vida grata cuando está a tu lado, eso amiga, es la mejor arma.<br>  <br>  2.- Checa si no estás dedicando demasiado tiempo a tu bebé relegando a tu marido. Yo te aconsejaría que trates de integrarlo al cuidado de tu peque y también ensé?ale a disfrutarlo. Pero hazlo con amor, no con quejas y exigencias.<br>  <br>  3.- Revisa si no te has descuidado, si lo has hecho ?Aguas!   Las nuevas mamás suelen hacer de su hijo el centro de su vida y a veces se olvidan hasta de pintarse la pesta?a. Haz ejercicio si has quedado flojita, ponte muy bonita, perfúmate y vuelve a seducirlo.  Trata de comportarte como cuando lo conociste.<br>  <br>  4.- Procura que tu peque tenga horarios sanos para dormir, sobre todo en la noche, para que así ustedes tengan un espacio de pareja.<br>  <br>  5.- No te encierres, si es necesario busca alguien que pueda quedarse una vez por semana con tu peque?o para que puedan salir a divertirse.<br>  <br>  6.- Recuerda siempre que ahora ese hombre es el padre de tu hijo, lucha por él, tú y tu peque?o son su familia, haz que él sienta que es querido.|`|1750319ec07f0052b608023f09c13415aa	Mi pregunta es, te has descuidado en tu persona, te has dejado engordar, cuando el llaga de trabajar como lo recibes, con la misma ropa con la que te levantaste en la ma?ana, te arreglas para el, eres sexy, lo atiendes bien el la cama lo complaces, yocreo que el matrimonio se vuelve rutina cuando alguien se descuida de su persona,necesitas llamar nuevamente su atencion y una vez que lo allas hecho es no bajar la guardia ustedes las mujeres saben como hacerlo, es por eso que uno se fija en otra persona cuando la nuestra se descuida o no tiene esos detalles, y esto es general tanto para hombres como para mujeres. tal vez su actitud que tiene hacia ti es causado por algo preguntale pon gan las cartas sobre la mesa. el bebe no es pretexto, aqui es solamente tu y tu esposo.|`|74773a029ed1945c9e86c25de5a1f3ffaa	Ante una tormenta en alta mar , remar con un solo remo encima de un peque?o bote, es sinónimo de naufragio...<br>  Si tu matrimonio está en crisis y tu esposo no desea ayuda profesional... significa que no está muy interesado en salvarlo... aun con un bebito como el que tienen...<br>  Los motivos los ignoro, puede ser simplemente desgaste o un tercero...en discordia..<br>  Pienso que deberías tratar el tema con mucha ternura, calma, sentarse a dialogar, sobre lo que les pasa... porque no está feliz... para ver si hay posibilidad de arreglo....<br>  Tal vez antes de plantearse una separación definitiva, podrían darse un tiempo separados para organizar sus sentimientos... y fijarse una fecha para reunirse y decidir....

But, who is to know whether her present romantic relationship will last either?<br>  <br>  This is not the green light for you to start having one-night stands or several romantic flings, if you haven't already. What you felt yesterday was normal and very natural. You just have to deal with it, realistically. Jumping into a relationship is not the answer here, anyway, but do keep your hopes high. You'll never know when you'll meet true love. That's one of the most beautiful mysteries of life that eventually gets solved.|`|GwQAlWDfaa	i personally think it might be awhile till you get over her.just try to stay busy and not look and as much as it hurt tell yourself it doesn't hurt as bad, but if you truly love her the feelings will never go away..|`|OaZk8It8aa	sometimes you dont get over people all the way. just push it to the back of your mind. and remember the future matters, not the past. its over.|`|St4EhA4waa	Getting over someone you care deepy about is taking the time to adjust to life without her. If you continue to think about her and allow her to control what you do than you will nevr be over her. You need to be abl to go to the places that you just to hang out together at, listen to your guys' favorite music, eat her favorite food, see her with others, and you need to be totally uneffected by this. When and if you can do that then you will be completely be over her and be able to get into a new relationship with her holding you back.

d4hfBj8Yaa	They are all talk, no action!<br>  <br>  Bums, nothing but bums.  Lazy, lazy bums.  Not worth the time or energy it takes to talk to them.|`|AA11388175	they want the attention|`|rMq9D06Faa	What does a man's financial situation have to do with his readiness to date?<br>  <br>  Unless you require gifts, fine dining, etc, then a broke guy can be ready to date.<br>  <br>  If he is unemployed and/or homeless, that is different!  <br>  <br>  It sounds like you are looking to be pampered. <br>  <br>  If the guy has a job, car and love to give that is enough to be ready for a relationship.|`|2e81d1d8ba8edc45b501ec9a0789fc3eaa	dating doesn't have to  cost  much, just because a guy doesn't make a lot of money, doesn't mean he is worthless.  i think a nice date is just being somewhere with a person i enjoy spending time with, maybe just a long walk and a soda.  i my opinion, if a man needs to spend a lot of money to impress a woman, then he must have some issues.|`|74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	hahahaha.. there are sooo many men in real life too.. I have had a couple relationships where they actually quit their job after meeting me.. hahahahaha.. that is my top criteria before getting in a relationship now.. must have a job, and keep it..How much money they make is not important.. as long as they have a job|`|a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	if they had money they would be busy at work and not online in chat rooms picking up chicks.|`|jOrK7ZX0aa	Yeah, they are looking for a Sugar Mama. Some are losers that are still married and looking for a little fun and sex on the side. Some lie about their age and are really 20 years older than they claim. Some claim to be doctors and can't even spell. Some are hoping they have found a rich woman to take care of them so they don't have to work. Be careful with the online dating. You never know who he or she really is. It could be a preditor or some person just out of prison. Be careful.|`|FQCsuBZwaa	maybe u are looking for the wrong thing in a relationship.|`|G6ceajMLaa	girl, when you find some that are actually about somethin, let ME know!!!, lol|`|aez7WCqQaa	Why should it always be the man who has to pay for everything?<br>  <br>  Dating usually entails trying to find similarities between two people. It doesn't matter if they are in a financial situation if you actually connected with them. <br>  <br>  You need to hold up your end of the stick as much as he does. If you're only interested in being taken full care of... then i wish you the best of luck.|`|ced52Hluaa	cause it's fun.
By2HAU85aa	Spill it all to your parents before they find out by some other means..and they will find out. This will preserve their trust in you and open a window of communication in regards to this ,and other, matters of importance.|`|2K9IJNPhaa	Go to his birthday party and have fun.  Don't worry about rather you should be just friends right now.  Time will help.....|`|10DjXLlWaa	best tell your parents right now about him being your b/f, plus tell them about the party and everything!|`|5lsE7NJuaa	Guys will come and go, but if you break your parents trust you will pay for it the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  Just tell them he is your bf and that you think he's a good guy, and encourage them to let you hang out with him - but don't force it (they will probably side with you if you let them agree with you on their own).|`|AA10591514	how old r u sorry?|`|ee7be4740f26d924965c0f3c4f5fae82aa	OMG!OMG!<br>  What are you 12? I don't even understand what you're trying to ask. Deal with your own pathetic problems.|`|4a2dd10689853b5977fc2eeea6eee28eaa	How old are you? And why doesn't your parents want you to have a boyfriend?  If they are invited to the party too what is the problem, let them do their thing at the party and lfirt with the birthday boy a little, and then maybe if you actually went to the party with your parents ask them on the ride home  what they thought of the birthday boy, and if they give you good feed back mention to them that you like him.........|`|7ZVVb0Avaa	Let your parents know what is going on. Then do what your parents expect of you. They may end up liking him. Especially if he is respectful to them. They may want you to be just friends. Obey your parents and respect their wishes.|`|huFgk3UVaa	Dont do that to him.  The whole "just friends thing" is devestating, much more than you might think.  Tell him your situation, and then have him just act like a friend at the party.  Then, once yall are really into eachother (if you are even still going out in a month) becuase by the sound of it you are very young and those relationships are hardly ever lasting.  Wait and see if your parents let up when you tell them the situation.|`|sLaFSSStaa	first thing, if you are 15 and up its ok to have a boyfriend in my book, now that may be different from your parents thought, so you should probably talk to them about it!
pr7KiFERaa	bro...talk to her about her boyfriend, always bring up the topic and she'll eventually click. its all good bro.|`|d5bb26110388802dbda15ee2194e0da4aa	She likes you, it's obvious.<br>  Continue to work the magic and she could be your girlfriend.<br>  <br>  First of all, she isn't going to break up with her boyfriend over nothing.  Right now you have to let her know that you like her back and you have to tell her.  She probably already knows that you like her but telling her is important.  I would suggest bringing up that you like her and see if she admits that she likes you too.  If you don't want to do that then tell her that you enjoy talking to her or spending time with her.  I think she'll get the message.<br>  <br>  After you let her know that you like her, don't change anything.  Continue to be her friend but don't push her to break up with her boyfriend.  You have to give her time to decide what to do.  By telling her that you like her, you put the ball in her court.  She has to decide between you and her boyfriend.  If you are patient and remain friends with her she will see that you really like her.  If you force the issue you may lose your chance.<br>  <br>  Ultimately the choice is up to her, but you don't stand a chance if you don't let her know you're interested.|`|dac26bdff4c1ae6e6c1c4dbb89df4ac1aa	well she likes you.|`|0870051eecdf1dac4b4f5c133d730fa7aa	u need to get your priorities straight. u r focused on the wrong thing. i feel real sorry for her boyfriend...|`|74530f1c293522b59e9e263928bd2299aa	A boyfriend of 2 months is not a relationship, that is still phase one... it takes much longer.  I say she is interested in you.  People cannot steal love from anybody.  Play it by ear.. If you enjoy talking to her, keep on doing so.. but also keep on seeing other people too.. don't put too much emphasis on it quite yet... but.. she definitely likes you..|`|a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	she wants to bang your brains out.|`|2ScNd4Uhaa	if she's got a man back off...some women today try to play you & get an ego trip tell her bf another guy is around too...he may be a nut and attack you & she'll like that guys fighting over her|`|8C3G85sEaa	this is a dilema...umm id say confront the situation even though u most likly know she likes you....and its up to you to be distant or persue it ...its your choice ...id be distant due to the fact i would nt wanna be the blame of ruining something , or it could also be something like shes  trying to get her boyfriend jelous and that wouldnt be a good place for you either|`|ZrjtzG8Vaa	She is playing her boyfriend and she is going to play you when you get her.....I wouldn't go out with a girl like that...|`|tApHwNgZaa	I would, in your position, ask her to go with you to a few places. If her boyfriend stops her from going. That gives you some leverage. Take her anyways. Tell her that your gonna be bored to tears with you cousin, even if its not the truth. Then it'll make her want to come. If her boyfriend keeps saying no, she's going to think of him as a jerk, and then you gotta make like the hero in shining armor, and explain to her that, if he treats her like that. He can't truly be the type of guy she wants to be with for the rest of her life. If she truly wants a guy to treat her right, she has to look to someone else. Hopefully she'll look towards you bro. If not, then there are other fishes in the sea. : P Good luck bro.
2pHb0gtzaa	A mi parecer tu marido es muy desconsiderado, en esas condiciones no entiendo como lo sigues aguantando, no quiero que entiendas por esto que deberias separarte, todo lo contrario. La intimidad es lo mas importante para la vida en pareja, y en tu casa eso no existe.

I would give him your number and see what happens. I mean the worst that could happen would be that he says no. Maybe you should think about the times that you have talked to him. What were they like? Did he look into your eyes and smile at you alot. These could be signs that he is interested... I would give him the number and go from there. If he doesn't call its not a big deal. He might also be too shy to make the first move, and fears rejection. You making the first move could give him the push to make another. Good Luck, and I hope it works out!
0685c0801b13b0807907261fa33a262baa	Hay muchas chicas que no saben que cosa es shoeplay, voy a poner aqui algo instructivo<br>  <br>   ?QUE ES SHOEPLAY, DANGLING, HEELPOPPING Y DIPPING?<br>  <br>  En el caso de las mujeres:<br>  <br>  El shoeplay es el arte que hacen las mujeres de descalzarse en lugares públicos o cuando hay gente que la puede estar observando. Ellas lo hacen de una forma sublime, como si nadie la estuviese observando.<br>  <br>  Por lo general es dado a que las mujeres estan con zapatos altos (tambien pueden ser bajos) que por lo general son cerrados y de solo meter el pie (que pueden ser zapatos abiertos), y sienten la sensación de querer descalzarse. Hay muchas que lo hacen en forma mecánica, que ni se dan cuenta de lo que hacen, al estar tan acostumbradas que estan al hacerlo.<br>  <br>  En los hombres:<br>  <br>  Es un fetichismo, en donde sentimos exitación al ver que las mujeres hacen shoeplay. Pueden llevarnos de 0 a 100 en 3 segundos (refiriendose al grado de exitación)<br>  <br>  Para un fetichista del shoeplay, en muchos casos, si una mujer tiene zapatos amarrados o con cierre, le pierden interes, pero si es que ven que viene una mujer que el estilo de zapatos pueden hacer shoeplay, como que el corazon se les "acelera" y le presta maximo interes.<br>  <br>  Es un fetiche de exitacion muy rapido, que se puede ver en cualquier lado y en cualquier momento. No es como otros fetiches que son en privado, sino que es en público y no es mal visto.<br>  <br>  En los conceptos adicionales que encierra el shoeplay existen varios tipos de hacer, como los que te explico aqui:<br>  <br>  Dangling: Que viene del ingles "columpiando", que es cuando el pie de la dama esta suspendido en el aire, por motivo de un cruce de piernas cuando esta sentada o similar, y es cuando el zapato se sale y se queda colgando en el pie. Puede ser solo colgando en los dedos del pie, como que sólo ha salido el talón. De ahi vienen las denominaciones de full-dangle o partial-dangle.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Dipping: Que es el ingles "zambullirse", que es cuando la dama, estan con el pie en el piso, lo que hace es sacar y ponerse el zapato, dejando el zapato en el piso.

dw440Lylaa	Why?....What do you want?<br>  <br>  If you had his best interests at heart, you could just be his friend, wanting what's best for him, (by the way, that is one simple definition of "love").<br>  <br>  The best thing you could do is stay away emotionally, until he decides to grow up a little.  You could stay "friends", (no touching, kissing, couch wrestling), unless you want to end up with more of the emotional pain this fella has been putting out.<br>  <br>  You say you still "want him".  Have you thought of what you'd do with him if you "had" him?  (And more importantly, how long it'd last, and how much pain you'd get to endure because of it?)<br>  Good luck|`|482bf0b8b30d0a735242c5f7266bdb4caa	reject HIM !!! of course !!!|`|a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	forget him!!<br>  he doesnt want to be your bf...he will only hook up with when he was bored....dont believe what he says...he just doesnt want to be your bf...but dont kiss him or talk to him again!|`|2wsBRcB7aa	Hey,  i no how that feels.

Just take into consideration that he has done this to you twice and if you want him doing it again. I hope this helps!

Las mujers aveces tenemos muchas cosas en la cabeza preocupaciones y demas y eso hace que nos den menos ganas aveces, por que no hablas con ella , preguntale que es lo que le esta pasando, talvez ella es de las que hacen todo en la casa y pues a la hora  de tener relaciones esta muy cansada, ayudala en casa, hagan de su vida  algo menos rutinario, salgan amenudo juntos  dile cuanto la quieres y cuanto te gusta todavia, a mi  me prende cuando mi pareja me dice que soy bonita y que todavia lo vuelvo loco.Si nada de esto  funciona pues te recomiendo que visiten un medico tal vez pueda darles hormonas.

Mira la universidad no es la escuela secundaria, no es igual sacarse una nota más o menos que una nota buena. Además no es justo para ti, porque si realmente estás interesada en tus estudios no puedes permitir que otro te tire abajo, tienes que ir para adelante, la vida no es fácil y a veces hay que elegir lo que es mejor para uno.<br>  Especialmente en los estudios, nadie va a hacer por ti lo que tu no hagas. En otros órdenes bueno se puede ayudar y hacer excepciones, pero si vas a obtener un título tan valedero como el que pretende tu amiga, pues será porque te lo has ganado, si no también le haces un da?o a tu amiga, que debería estudiar más y no ir a la facultad a pasarla bien.

Si tienes la conciencia tranquila de que vos te comportaste bien con ella y que fue ella la que te fallo, entonces tomate tu tiempo, dedicate a tus hijos que son chiquitos y con el tiempo te vas a dar cuenta si vale la pena volver con ella o no.

Suerte|`|f72cf875e5f2a7cdc199161a27bac195aa	Pase algo similar(no igual) sabes todos tenemos curiosidad de ni?os .Yo lo perdone y entendí que todos cometemos errores.Al momento yo amo a mis 3 hermanos sin importar lo que paso o dejo de pasar.<br>  <br>  Perdonalo y veras lo bien que te sentirás,mas ahora que esta enfermo.El debe de pensar que nunca te pidió perdón por todo lo sucedido y éso le hará todo el da?o que tu has  sentido.|`|hpq3sYJgaa	Tu necesitas ir para un sicólogo por q tu fuiste molestada por tu hermano. Para tu lograr acercarte a el, tu necesitas estar curada mentalmente porque tu estas rencorosa por lo q el te hizo y di le a toda la familia lo q ese maniático te hizo porque así como te lo hizo a ti a lo mejor se lo hizo a otra persona de la familia. Dicen q cuando una persona molesta a las otra sexual mente es porque ellos fueron molestado también. Habla ahora q el esta vivo para ver si a el otra persona de la familia lo molesto a el sexualmente.|`|mt9BcN4yaa	No mencionas que edad tenia tu hermano, si ya era adulto tienes toda la razón en rechazarlo, pero si era un ni?o igual que tu debes pensarlo pues recuerda que los hombres tardan más en madurar que nosotras las mujeres.<br>  Por experiencia propia (pues también me paso algo feo con mi hermano) te digo que el rencor que guardas al final te hace mas da?o a ti que a él. PIENSALO Y SURTE.|`|oGJsi1kZaa	Amiguita: Yo mas que nadie te entiendo, a mi me pasó algo parecido a ti desde los 8 a?os hasta los 12, pero con un primo, pero era él el que me tocaba a mi, y como yo me desarrollé a los 11 ahí se volvió más apasionado ya empezó a hacerme sexo oral, y eran cosas que vivi en el momento en que no me tocaba vivirlas, eso mismo te ocurrió a ti, entonces yo no lo podía ver a el en la cara, y mi familia no entendía eso, me rega?aban porque era muy antipatica con él sabiendo que me hacía tantos favores y me lo imponían, eso era terrible porque yo vivía en casa de mi abuelita y él iba todos los días a almorzar allá, es terrible y por eso te comprendo, ahora afortunadamente vivo en otra ciudad y no tengo que verlo, pero muchas veces me tocó atender sus visitas a mi casa y que duro fue porque mi familia tampoco sabia nada y no lo podía confesar, por eso te digo que si no quieres visitarlo en su enfermedad no lo hagas, si es duro para ti no te sacrifiques solo pidele a dios por su salud, porque si mi primo estuviera en la situación de tu hermano, yo no se si lo haría, pero si tu conciencia te dicta que debes ir a visitarlo, hazlo pero no te demores dile que deseas su recuperación y te despides y ya.<br>  Mucha gente te dirá que perdones pero no es tan facil porque no han vivido la misma situación que tu.|`|tSGQor5saa	Cuando una persona pasa por lo que tu pasaste en esa edad, genera muchos problemas, no sólo de rencor hacia él. Si lo que te dijo, fue hace tiempo y aún lo recuerdas, seguramente encuentras algo de cierto en que los hombres sólo buscan sexo de parte de las mujeres, y no se puede pensar así.. porque si bien hay hombres que sólo se dejan guiar por su instinto animal, también hay otros que saben controlarse y respetar a la mujer.<br>  <br>  Bueno, eso de ir a visitarlo.... Sólo si te nace; si no te nace, no te pueden obligar... Aunque yo he escuchado casos de personas que odian a su padre o a algún familiar, pero cuando éste se encuentra enfermo (casi por morir), van a verlo, por todo el rencor que sientan y no es que vayan en un plan amoroso o amistoso a ir de frente a abrazarlo... pero quizás esté bien ir unos 5 minutos, decirle que se mejore y ya. Eso es ético y bueno, eso no quita que sigas con tu indiferencia frente a él, pero al menos un "Espero que te mejores" o "lo siento mucho", quita mucho peso de encima y te deja, aunque sea, un poco de paz.<br>  Pero insisto en que si no deseas ni eso, estás en todo tu derecho y no tienes por qué contar, a estas alturas, lo que pasó hace a?os. Sólo olvídalo, supéralo y dedícate a tu familia que seguro es la mejor compa?ía que tienes. =)|`|0b0e401edb8edaf3919973c051b62a61aa	Hola, Chio, la verdad me impacto tu exposiciòn y aùn cuando este sea un medio en el cual no vemos rostros te admiro el valor.<br>  <br>  Por situaciones vividas en lo personal te comprendo ese resentimiento, pero pienso que debes buscar còmo externar ese sentimiento porque, visto honestamente, te està lastimando ante la duda que tu familia percibe.<br>  <br>  Creo que debes decidir si expones con tus familiares cercanos la situaciòn que viviste -me parece necesario que ellos conozcan la situaciòn de agresiòn que ejerciò èl sobre tì- quizà no te comprendan, quiza no lo quieran aceptar debido al estado de salud que èl vive ahora pero tù tambièn estas enferma por los recuerdos del abuso.<br>  <br>  Armate de valor y decidete o, a no hablar del tema y oìr los reclamos familiares o a hablar el asunto de la manera màs abierta que puedas.

A tu familia? solo diles que tienes tus razones y que confien en tu decision, que si tienen dudas que hablen con tu hermano.|`|65e6dd2f922854654f44903369e32631aa	La verdad es bastante complejo, por que tienes emociones encontradas, de todas formas  deberías llamarlo para saber como esta.<br>  De otro lado debes buscar ayuda profesional guardar ese tipo de  emociones no es bueno para tu salud mental y espiritual tal ves así curarías esa herida que no sana.|`|B1VgDRzBaa	Es completamente normal que sientas cierta clase de repudio hacia su persona, pero es cierto que también, si llegara a morir y nunca trataron de sanar esas "heridas" te sentirás algo de culpable porque ni siquiera lo intentaron. Te recomiendo que le demuestres que eres fuerte, madura y que ahora puedes enfrentarle y tienes conciencia de que lo que hizo no fue nada bueno, a menos de que tu lo consintieras que no creo que sea tu caso. El punto es que trates de hablar con el y así, al menos le puedes decir que no quieres hablar con el ni saber mas de el. Y con respecto a tu familia, podrías decirles para que no piensen mal de ti, pero no creo que sea algo necesario ya que eso paso entre ustedes y puede ser, no lo se, que no te crean, aunque seria lo mas sano hablar con tu familia pues ellos podrían ayudarte en algo, al menos en apoyar las decisiones que tomes con respecto a tu hermano.|`|ENimkWmaaa	claro q' no tienes q' hablarle si tu todavía tienes en tus recuerdos esos momentos tan asquerosos q' no te puedes olvidar de ellos no lo llames por q' te puede ser mucho da?o. por favor ten comfiansa en ti misma y en tu esposo cuentale lo q' te paso de joven con tu hermano y beras q' te bas asentir mucho mejor. tu hermano te tiene q' pedir perdón por aberte usado de esa manera por q' lo q' iso no tiene perdón  de dios. muchísima suerte cuidate  besos.!!!!!!

Whatever  interests  him,  interests  me  too.  It's  always  a  good  thing  to  know  a  few  good  jokes  to  tell.  Occasionally,  ask  her  what  she  thinks  about  something?

If you're friends with her, try talking to her about something she likes. Once you're good friends, try asking her out. Or if one of your friends are friends with her, try getting them to ask her who she likes at the moment. You've got more success if it's a girl who asks her.

Such connections as the two of you seem to have are rare; don't take this for granted. <br>  <br>  As for how to get something going: be direct. This is the most effective way.

The only thing I can tell you as a guy is if a girl says she is interested and if a guy is not attracted emotionally to the girl ..he will keep her on the hook cause he does not wanna let go of a potential "booty call". And if he feels you are a real friend he will never bring up any sexual talks - so the friend part if off... Ask your self if you really love him or you have become emotionally dependent on him ...cause the later one is more dangerous and kinda puts people in the stalker category after some time...if you are in love then express it ..if he says otherwise then ...for sure he is not interested ..you can accept that if you also would like to keep him as a potential booty call ...or else ..bid adieu to him.|`|AA12202983	i think you should just bring it up casually to the guy. it sounds like you guys have talked so much that it should be easy to talk to him by now about basically anything. maybe you should consider doing it person to person though, not on the internet, as many times it can lead to mistakes and stuff. but neways i think you should just go ahead and talk to him since you really like him and stuff and im sure he likes you too since he commits time to you and all. i would end that relationship with the other guy so he doesnt suspect anything else...good luck!!! :D|`|Uuldxz4kaa	Well you're a girl used some of that flirting seduction that you do. When I know a girl likes me I also flirt and tease her around. You get to control someone who likes you. Maybe you don't want to be like that so you just try to show him how good of a person you are and maybe pretend to not be interested in him. He did tease you and talk to you for hours and all so he has feelings for you. By the way dump your boyfriend if you like this guy.|`|VipX0hhoaa	okay girl, its time to face the truth.<br>  1) He already TOLD YOU THAT HE DOESN'T LIKE YOU!<br>  2) You HAVE A BOYFRIEND!<br>  <br>  wow.|`|e65az4NUaa	Well, what an interesting yet long story...

For one thing, she's interested in someone else. Telling her you like her will just cause friction in the atmosphere & cause the two of you to be uncomfortable around each other. If she's interested in someone else, there's your answer. Telling her you like her will do nothing, except lower the friendship level.<br>  <br>  See how it goes with her love interest, & if something happens between the two of them, you shouldn't tell her a thing. Plus, while she likes him, it'd be best not to tell her anything. If her feelings die for him, that should be when you tell her.

You can tell her in a way that if she wants something else closer that door is open with you, but if not friends is perfect for now.|`|rtzEySMVaa	that depends... how much do you value her friendship?  if you really value her friendship, don't let her know and just work on being friends... because once you cross that line between friends and lovers, it's very hard to go back to being "just friends". also, if it doesn't work out as lovers, you might end up losing a really good friend...   if that's not the case, go for it, she may feel the same as you do... good luck|`|u5NVMPaEaa	you should tell her  how you feel

No te preocupes por la forma en que te realicen el examen porque siempre son profesionales los que lo hacen y ten por seguro que casi nada de nuestra anatomía les impresiona ya sea por grande o por chiquito.Animo y buena suerte en tu trabajo|`|248b8bbca21a95ef0608fdd752399f07aa	dejate de tanto drama y lo q me dijo mi amigo......<br>  <br>  los pruebas de orina se hacen frente a un medico para q no lleves la de otra persona....<br>  <br>  la bieometria hematica es para ver q no tengas enfermedades,<br>  <br>  y cualquier prueba q te realizan siempre es buena para detectar enfermedades y para prevenirlas, el hecho de q te manden a hacer un analisis clinico completo no es por q estes malo si no toddo lo contrario|`|hpq3sYJgaa	El q nada debe, nada teme. Si tu sabes q no estas en nada malo no tienes porq estar preocupado. Eso examenes no son nada malo lo he hecho muchas veces.

J5Oq3zMFaa	I don't have balls but I know what guys think in this situation!  They think these girls have little self respect, few morals, aren't disciplined and are easy.....and easy targets for rape or other violent crimes against women!  Think about it my love, good times come to those who wait!  Just wait another couple of years until you come of age.  You don't need alcohol to have a blast!  Just rev up your personality baby and be the life of the party that way!  You'll be much sexier and smarter to any guy as a sober party girl, rather than a swaying, slerring and booze smelling chick that anyone could have his way with with enough vodka and tequila.|`|AA12017680	Dumb.They end up in situations they can not handle.|`|jTHJhy2laa	Easy pickings.Once she passes out,he puts it in.|`|54584be41adb64f9b6e8e05f340e3cabaa	I don't usually think about them, but now that I have: flippin retards.

hI1TWOuGaa	Mira, como ya lo respondí en varias otras oportunidades, en temas de enamoramiento siempre existen 2 etapas. La primera es el encandilamiento o enamoramiento, en que la persona se siente totalmente transportada a otro mundo, ama lo que ve e idealiza lo que todavía no vé. Es muy común que este encandilamiento dure entre 3 a 8 meses que es cuando uno realmente conoce a quien tiene enfrente, con todos sus virtudes y sus defectos. Si en esta segunda etapa se sigue amando a la otra persona, es amor verdadero, está enamorada del otro, y hasta puede amar sus defectos y aceptarlos. Si cuando pasa el encandilamiento el amor comienza a enfriarse, era solo eso, encandilamiento pero no era amor.<br>  Espero haberte ayudado!<br>  MUCHA SUERTE!!|`|6SKlyL9Uaa	Uyy.. es muy probable.. aunque como dicen: fácil llega, fácil se va... también es muy probable que al no tener suficientes bases esté termine rápidamente... por eso es mejor esperar un poco para no lamentarnos después...no crees? <br>  Que tengas mucha suerte!!<br>  <br>  Besitos???|`|70d29523e6b61d3c01dfc6999d47c2b6aa	Holaa<br>  mira en un mes..es posible 100% enamorarse de alguien..ademas si llevas mucho tiempo de conocer a la persona antes de ser novios.<br>  y si asi no fuera...ahi personas que al primer mes dan todo de si..de su alma..de su corazón qe alcanzan a enamorarse tan rapido que es dificil de creer pero es posible en todo sentido.|`|MP7XpLxQaa	Por supuesto que si, pues "enamoramiento" y "amor" no son la misma cosa. "Enamoramiento" es una etapa en la cual una persona nos atrae por diversos motivos: el fisico, el trato, empatia, afinidad de gustos, etc. Es por eso que nos podemos enamorar "a primera vista". De eso, a que sintamos o hayamos encontrado "el amor" es otra cosa.<br>  <br>  Bye.|`|TQpyHNKjaa	si hay casos pero muylejanos y hay posivilidad|`|WM5Vw9o9aa	si es posible de echo en tres dias yo me enamore y ella tambien =)|`|hpq3sYJgaa	Nada es imposible en esta vida.

Tuvieron sexo ese mismo día y hoy tiene 20 a?os de matrimonio con el esposo.|`|jFp7LNnUaa	El amor no tiene ni tiempo ni edad, si te enamoras es porque la persona de la que te enamoraste te parece linda y sensacional|`|QVCeTGZiaa	mira sinceramente, no creo q este enamorado, si aun no te as acostado con él, casi seguro q no esta enamorado y lo q kiere es acostarse con tigo. Y si ya te as acostado con él, es mas probable q este enamorado.

7a995fb1a8d3f85ae473ce8f1d473034aa	Tus amigas hablan desde la más absolutas de las ignorancias. Si bien es cierto que la libido se va diluyendo con el tiempo ..... a los 34 está super potente. Fijate en la edad de los deportistas y te darás cuenta de la potencia de tu novio.<br>  Por lo demás no tenés que preparar, ni estimular ni nada. Si deseas hacer el amor directamente buscalo a él con todas tus armas de mujer....nada más ..... Si él te desea ..... pues se pondrá en movimiento.|`|27c4375bb0adaaedea070b909f75b527aa	No tienes nada que hacer, el siemple hecho de tener 14 a?os ,menos que tu novio, te hace especial, el con la edad y experiencia que tiene, te va a tratar como una reina, eso si, tendras que ser muy complaciente con el para que tambien el se enamore de ti y de tu cuerpo, y no tener miedo a experimentar nuevas cosas en el terreno sexual con tu novio, porque por ser mayor, debera estar muy toreado en esas cosas, pero por el libido o potencia, creeme que te va a sorprender y aun y cuando no tienes ninguna experiencia sexual, aun, un muchacho de tu edad nunca se podra comparar a un hombre como tu novio, ya que el le gana con la experiencia y a esa edad y con una muchachita de 20 a?os, se va a volver loco y seras arcilla en sus manos para hacerte la amante perfecta, asi que no temas, cuando te llegue el momento de estar sexualmente con tu novio, lo vas a disfrutar y mucho.......|`|4f4abe6bf57141877675e6eba75f6948aa	hola, amiga, primero investiga si no tiene compromiso anterior, después asegurate de anticonceptivos, en cuanto a con quién pierdas tu virginidad eso es secundario, la primera vez estan especial como la segunda, la tercera etc., lo importante es que tu estes de acuerdo en tener relaciones y no verte presionada, recuerda no hay que pensar por los dos, tal vez para ti es magico y para el sea algo como comerse un chicle ojo. vive el momento pero protegida por cualquier enfermedad venerea y por embarazos no deseados, y además en nuestra cultura le dan mucha importancia a la virginidad, así que si te entregas a él, y no es tu pareja para siempre, tal vez te encuentres a otro y que le importe mucho la virginidad, claro que no vales por eso, pero, puede pasar, hay que pensar un poco.|`|40976205ad1d3cab268bead0ff28f296aa	Tus amigas estan mas, no has oido que mas sabe el diablo por viejo que por diablo.<br>  <br>  Entre mas tiempo de vida sexual tiene  un hombre, que se preocupa por satisfacer a una mujer, te va a dar un mejor sexo en la cama.<br>  <br>  Ademas, contra que lo vas a comparar, es tu primera vez, y probablemente tengas mas con otras parejas. <br>  <br>  Mejor no te preocupes por esas tonterias y disfrutalo, deja que las cosas lleguen, creeme, el sexo no planeado (que quede claro que no significa, no seguro eh) es el mas rico de todos.<br>  <br>  Ademas si tus amigas son de 20, que tanto pueden saber, o todas han tenido multiorgasmos, les han hecho gritar hasta quedar afonicas, cuando terminan el acto sexual con su pareja han quedado tan felices que le dicen gracias y lo quieren compensar??<br>  <br>  Relajate, y disfruta tu vida sexual.<br>  <br>  Si tu crees que el es el indicado, el ganon, el bueno, adelante.|`|b3243ee90ca0e61eb5fcc7be8cc61560aa	mmm<br>  No lo hagas tanto caso a tus amigas al repecto . .los hombres a esa edad es cuando somos Mejores Amantes . .te tienen envidia o no saben lo que dicen . . .solo se tu Misma dejate llevar por el Momento . .lo demás solo sale . .

TE DOY UN CONSEJO mejor busca un hombre de tu edad que te de el sexo q te corresponde segun tu edad, porque los hombres mas grandes son manosos, como dicen el ya vivio su vida y seguro esta bien corretiado. y creeme q si a los 34 no tiene pareja o ha fracasado es por algo. ES UNA SENAL DE Q POR ALGO ESTABA SOLO. habre bien los ojos q esos son los peores porque cuando encuentran otra mas joven te dejan..

Otra cosa empieza a tomar tus desciones y no dudes de lo q pienses, pq si la gente te hace dudar como lo hacen tus amigas te falta mucho para madurar. ( te lo digo pq me paso lo mismo) eso a ellos les molesta mucho, q para tomar una decision necesitas como 40 opiniones de diferentes personas, tu toma tus decisiones no dejes q nadie te corra la vida.. tomalo como un consejo creeme por experiencia lo se... si tienes preguntas me puedes escribir a fabypg2003@hotmail.com|`|c5019f2829221078370ae77e9a8196fcaa	Pues no se cuanto tiempo lleves con él pero...  si no han tenido relaciones yo creo que el cuate esta más que estimulado y listo para hacerte el amor!!!!<br>  <br>  Y en cuanto a la potencia....  naaaaaa Eso que dicen tus amigas no es verdad recuerda que es solo el amor y la pasion que sientes por tu pareja lo que logra el grandioso poder de la exitación...<br>  <br>  Aparte creo que tienes razón creo que él seria el más indicado para tratarte con más delicadeza para ese momento...<br>  <br>  <br>  Saludos!

qkG9vFUlaa	Hi Unless you want it to be a surprise, why not ask your friend what would be important to him about celebrating his dads love? Then when you are clear about what is important to him, you can plan something that really honers his wishes, and his dads memory.<br>  <br>  Some times it is easier to ask, then try to guess!:)<br>  Good luck! Your friend is lucky he had a good dad and he has a good friend!|`|AA12247182	Take him Out On Dinner and say him that ur really sorry about his Dad but he always next to him Cus he really Loves you.

Pupils get bigger around u (watch out for changing lite tho)<br>  3.  He Hangs around ur friends (instead of his) and ask them about what u like. <br>  4. He'll be really interested in what u r saying (even if ur not talking 2 him)<br>  5. Remember little details about u and what u say<br>  6. says u did great even if u sucked<br>  7. drops his own little hints like, "I love your laugh"<br>  8. Stares at u<br>  9.

vAy3xl8Naa	It must be very unpleasant for you if all you are getting is negativity coming at you, especially from those closest to you who should value you. Not a good place to be, I'm sure. The greatest cause of low confidence is our home, the way we are brought up and the support we have. It does not seem as though you have too much support at the moment, but you have lots of time to turn it around, so don't worry.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is to begin to appreciate who you are and to love yourself. No one can love what you reject, so stop thinking that you are fat and ugly. If you believe that about yourself, how can anyone else think otherwise?  So, as hard as it is, just keep telling yourself EVERY DAY how lovely and slim you are, how unique and special (because you are, there's no one else like you!) and say it as often as you can in your head. You really have to get on top of the negative thoughts which are your constant company and replace them with more positive, uplifting ones because thoughts are the keys to the quality of our life. Negative thoughts simply give poor self-esteem because people treat you exactly how you treat yourself.<br>  <br>  Next, try and accept that you ARE worthy. If you don't accept that fact, you will always put off people from making connections with you. You really have to like yourself if you want guys to like you. That self-love will make you seem more attractive instead of being just gloomy and negative.  Most important, take an interest in others too and take the focus off yourself. You will be even more interesting as a person because you will feel more included in social things. Often when we are unhappy we just sink inside of us and notice the negative things while ignoring positive ones, which only makes us boring to be with and appear self-centred. <br>  <br>  Third, try to build up other friendships outside your home which are more supportive and positive. You cannot help the family you are born into, but you are an adult now so you can take some steps to build up other social friendships which will make you feel much better and reduce the time you have to spend hearing negative comments. There are social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace which can help you make new friends who like you and build your esteem.<br>  <br>  Confidence comes from inside us, nowhere else, but it is tied up with our feeling of belonging, acceptance, achievement and self-esteem. Once you sort out these aspects, especially the self-esteem and feeling of achievement, your confidence will grow, but it does take a while without positive help. You have to make a superhuman effort to be positive in that kind of environment, to focus upon good things and ignore the negatives around you. Begin to appreciate that guys do like you because you are attractive and they will lose interest if you never return their attention. Most of all, begin to give thanks and gratitude or your life, to welcome every new day instead of taking it and your blessings for granted. You will begin to feel much better about you.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you might find the confidence articles and quiz in the source list useful.|`|aflW9Y2iaa	yess there is plenty of hope for u. my family is kind of the same way with me because i am very shy. for just a start, u should try going up to random people at the mall and start a small convo with them. then move on to talking longer convos with as many guys as u can find. this will get u used to talking to people and it will help u gain confidence as long as u relax and try to have a good time. u can also get ur friend to join u with this because it sometimes helps u relax.|`|WVPHW3Njaa	Well first of all if u think ur too fat, pls help urself by hitting the gym, then maybe after ull get a boost of confidence.|`|4XmfpcgBaa	heyy--so wat if u don't have a boyfriend yet? the bestflowers bloom late. one way to gain confidence is quite fun, actually. look at yourself in the mirror, with no make-up on, and tell yourself you are the sexiest thing in the world. doesn't matter if it's true or not--tell it to yourself, and BELIEVE it. when you walk, smile, and don't just walk--STRIDE. you are who are, and if people don't love you for it, their loss! and plus, wouldn't it be BETTER to be like you? i mean, your sister has a "revolving door for guys"--well, that sux for her, cuz that just means a guy walks into her life, and then leaves! those guys don't mean ANYTHING. wouldn't you rather have one guy you REALLY love, than to have many guys who just walk through ur life, then leave you like you're nothing to them? i certainly wouldn't want that, would you?|`|UkV63Jjcaa	Of course there's hope for you!!! Never let anyone tell you otherwise. Sometimes, I find it's best not to think about why people talk to you too much. If someone is talking to you, even if they are "just being nice" it stilll means they want to!!! I think its important not to view every man you come across as a potential boyfriend. You can never have too many friends and you WILL get a boyfriend when it's meant to be. <br>  <br>  I wish I could tell u an easy three step approach or something to gain confidence in yourself but Im sorry to say I can't. You have to forget what those haters said about you and think about what good qualities you have. To appear confident and in control (even if you don't feel like you are) make yourself stand up straight. Make EYE CONTACT at all times and have a firm handshake. Don't be afraid to smile and don't worry that what you have to say is not good enough. Building confidence is a work in progress and when you actually do feel good about yourself, instead of pretending you do, you'll know.<br>  <br>  The boyfriend thing will happen, don't worry. People are getting married older and older this days!! Good luck and keep your head up (literally, lol) :-)|`|YIwS8KdYaa	First of all your confidence comes from within not from dating.  I'm sorry your family has been so cruel, I simply can't imagine why they would say such things.  You seem to be a very kind person.  If a guy is giving you attention it certainly doesn't mean he feels sorry for you.  More likely he is attracted to you, finds you interesting and would truly like to get to know you better.  Take it slow and work on building up your own confidence, no one else can do it for you.  You sound like you have alot to give.
Sbrex4Wraa	When you don't get love, attention, tenderness, the tender feeling of a nice touch that every human being wants and needs what happens is that you spirit will start dying inside of abandonment and loneliness.  Every human being in this world need to feel love not matter what anybody says.  <br>   <br>  Your boyfriend personality tells me that he is the   emotionless type.  those that are ashamed to express what they feel even if they feel something inside, but the person who doesn't have the ease to express what they feel not matter what are the type of persons that make the worst husbands/boyfriends/girlfriends etc;  <br>  <br>  I am not talking about sex I am talking about tenderness, sweetness... the kind that is so necessary and appreciated in a relationship.  <br>  After 2 years in a relationship with someone who has no desire to make you feel love, I do believe that is time for you to either accept him the way he is if it is possible for you to bear a life without affection at all, or to move on and find someone closer to what you really want from someone in a relationship.  I would it have dump him in a month... <br>  <br>  Oh! he hasn't take you out ever??? Gee whiZ!  he's cheap!!!  Another very good reason to dump him!|`|85a8f0d6d41c57acd11e132086872502aa	Yes.  And all you can do is be yourself and quit trying to change him.  If you aren't getting what you want they you are needy aren't you?|`|uW4Bup4Naa	sounds like he doesn't love you, and you def sound like you could do better|`|a69b8dd90d35b9553cfe95247afce8aeaa	well hes not gonna change...if u dont like it..dump him!|`|rndS9iPwaa	you should let him know that he can do other things to surprise you...like leaving you notes or letters..cards..make you a special dinner..let him know that theres alot of other things he can do to make you happier and he should be able to do it not because he has to but because he wants to. so i would go from there

You have to be really direct with him. Say something like, "A while back you asked if I like you. I let you know in a note that I do. You don't really show it though, so I was wondering if you still feel that way." Yes, it will be hard to ask that, but you won't have to wonder anymore!|`|WVPHW3Njaa	Well it's good that you answered the first time,but damn y did he ask u if he didnt want to hook up with u in the first place.That's kinda cold on his part.
f996c1b89c6d7f11756561d92baddbafaa	That's a good thing. A very good thing. If he's your crush and not into you or as into you as you would want him to be, then he'll get out of your head quicker than if he were still here. You most likely won't run into him again or hear about him, and the pain will lessen as new folks come into your life.<br>  <br>  If you saw him everyday, or hear about him often, or even live/work near him, it just becomes an obsession. And that's really unhealthy for you.<br>  <br>  I know it's hard, but it's the best that can happen when dealing with a crush.<br>  <br>  Give it about 3-4 months, if you need this much time. Things will be better for you.|`|cT2s6Ekgaa	Keep in contact with him/her.

hJljW0lHaa	Well if he doesn't he doesn't, most people have a spark and sometimes it just fades away. Being romantically involved with someone for over a year and then all of a sudden them saying they just dont feel the same anymore...well, I wouldn't take it too well. Do him and yourself a favour and break it off - you gave it a good try, go out and find the right person for you.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Don't hang on to someone because of fear...

BUT it's up to your boyfriend after your break up.. Coz most men, says that it's ok to be friend after they broke up but in just hours or days, they curse their ex-girlfriend for leaving them. He would normally think that if you want to be just-friends, then he would thought that you don't love him as "boyfriend" but as a friend. Just think of every way to tell him that your feelings is gone. If he don't get it, fine! No big deal. But if he do, you might become best friends. Trust me on this. Good luck!|`|PupTeMduaa	i dont know where you are getting at with this.

Y recuerda que los lazos afectivos no se crean en automático, así que si ellos llegaron a apreciar a la ex, les tomará algún tiempo superar el cambio y comenzar a apreciarte a ti. Mientras, sé amable, accesible, compartida (no quieras estar tooodo el tiempo con tu novio, sin dejarlo pasar ratos a solas con sus amigos).

n105FXWeaa	Mira es muy dificil que alguien cambie de parecer. Yo quisas le creiria si me lo dijo enojado pero no se fue como una discusion y aun haci esta de dudar. Pero el se fue y empeso una relacion eso ya no es logico. Mira lo que pienso que paso es que ya no te quiere como antes ya no te ama. Conosio a esa persona y le llamo la tencion o le atrajon algo a el y valiendole que te podia perder por siempre se arriesgo por amor a la otra persona. Y por alguna razon no funciono puede que ella no le gusto algo o le exijia algo nose y terminar y haora quiere volver contigo porque los hombres son tan dependientes que no pueden estar solos. Ponte a pensar que el te abondono no son ninos que cambian de parecer o no saben lo que quieren. Piensalo bien y fijate si quieres tener a alguien a tu lado que puede cambiar de parecer de la noche a la manana. Ellos te dicen hasta lo que no por convencerte hasta a llorar se ponen los canijos. si tu lo amas y piensas regresr con el apesar  de todo haslo pero no tan rapido que le cueste y le sude al cabron para que lo piense bien cada vez que haga algo. Y tambien tu te vas a dar cuenta si te quiere dile que necesitas tiempo que estas dolida y haslo esperar unos 1 o 2 meses y si el te espera y te sigue buscando sin tener nada de nada es que alomejor si te quiere y si no vas a ver que va a andar con alguien mas. Nunca les demuestres cuanto lo amas porque se aprovechan Suerte!!!|`|3bm238dvaa	Como dicen:<br>  <br>  NADIE SABE LO QUE TIENE HASTA QUE LO VE PERDIDO.<br>  <br>  Lo que tienes que investigar es que fue lo que hizo pensar a tu marido que ya no te amaba, ademas lo mas importante si tu lo sigues amando y si es asi todos tenemos derecho a una segunda oportunidad.|`|MP7XpLxQaa	Yo pienso que tu marido esta en crisis existencial y ni el sabe lo que quiere. Lo malo es que muy probablemente, en un tiempo vuelva a enga?arte y a decirte que ya no te ama . Y eso es porque tiene la comodidad de que haga lo que haga, tu lo vas a aceptar.

Hubieron algunos que pensaron que eramos novios; eso también se me paso por la mente, pero logre darme cuenta que solo era producto de lo que la gente decia y aveces del ego que uno lleva dentro, y con una mujer hermosa todos quieren sorprender. Yo no sentía amor por ella, solo era un espejismo llenado por lo que la gente expresaba. <br>  <br>  Tal era la relación que platicabamos todo el tiempo, muchas veces nos quedabamos laborando mucho más tiempo que otros compa?eros por recuperar el tiempo perdido (para nosostros no lo era) en platicar, conocí mucho más de lo que debia saber de su vida y ella de la mia. El punto es que hay un dicho: "Que un hermano nunca es un buen amigo, pero que un amigo siempre resulta ser más que un hermano", de tal manera que fijate lo importante que es tener a nuestro lado y el tiempo que querramos a una persona que nos proporcione confianza, seguridad y tiempo suficiente para escucharnos y compreder por lo que pasamos, a una persona sincera y honesta que más que mentirte y ser hipocrita es sumamente franca para decirnos las cosas tal cual son. Esto mi querido amigo no lo encuentras ni a la vuelta de muchos kilometros, y tu tienes el privilegio al igual que yo de tener a ese tesoro llamado "Mejor amigo (a)", no tires al tacho de la basura algo que tiene un valor incalculable para los seres humanos.<br>  <br>  Medita un poco ese sentimiento tuyo y analiza con cabeza fria lo que quieres y/o deseas.

To be honest, what you need to do is forget about the guy, and well, forget about your friend.  First of all, if a guy likes you, he will try to let you know how he feels.  He will only pay attention to you and not to your friends.  In regards to your friend, she is a true backstabber and sleeze bag.  How can a friends do that to each other?  That's just not right.  If she really was your friend, she would have told him to stop acting like that, and to stop spanking her, or to stop touching her, but she only showed that she liked it, and the worst part of all is that she was laughing in your face.  Like I said, that is not something a true friend would do.  As to the guy, he is just not worth it.  I know you don't want to be with someone who plays around with other girls.  The most important thing a guy can offer you is respect.  So I would say you need to let him go, and know that you deserve better.  There are good guys out there, but you just have to know how to pick them.  If he calls you just act cool, treat him like any other friend, without being too friendly or too flirty with him.  You deserve better than that guy, and you deserve a better friend.  If the guy calls just avoid his calls, and if your friend talks to you tell her to back off.  Remember not to let them take advantage of you.  Be strong and stand up for yourself. You can meet other friends and guys, but just avoid these two backstabbers.  Good luck.|`|a6752c5d47bd59f73a3df3e0e678ccc1aa	okay.. it seems like he just wants to get some.. and true friends wouldnt do that. your going to college so.. most likely you'll neva see them again.. good luck anyways.|`|0Jr9omhFaa	Let him go- if he sees that he can't have you that will probably drive him crazy...but i mean if he's gonna feel up on other girls with you sitting right there he probably wouldnt take a relationship seriously<br>  <br>  good luck|`|IvMhqRIOaa	Ditch the guy, make amends with your friend, tell her that she hurt you and if she's a good friend she will listen AND not do it again.

But you need to ask him why he is acting this way and if he really cared about you then he wouldn't do that to you.|`|uglYfiRSaa	boink -boink|`|vlCESC2Qaa	here is my opinion.. when the guy calls, tell him how you feel towards him and that you really didnt like the way that he acted in front of you. i jus graduated and i can tell you from experience.. there are plenty more guys. i know its hard but its best to move on. also tell your friend that you dont appreciate her actions, but dont let her go. because sometimes its better to make up with a friend then to not talk to them because friendship gets you through everything no matter what it is. but if the guy does that in front of you, he probably does worse when you are not looking. so keep your head up, stay confident, and find someone much better!!
4b00d9a31d6a0bab2ccf1a1493eca11faa	You can either suck it up and get the courage to talk to him even though he is around his friends or you can respect the fact that he likes someone else and move on to another guy.|`|f008a2cfd307189e80227ac2a0148365aa	I suggest you learn how to spell boy thats far more important.|`|aapFvNg3aa	flirt with him, let him know you like him (but never actuallly tell him), make plans to go out to the same place he is going..<br>  or you could approach him one day and casually say.. i found out you used to like me.. how is it that we never went out?.. or something like that.. boys tend to like girls who are direct and know what they want..
3q7yPfdaaa	Creo que has respondido tu propia pregunta... "las personas te miran mal y con odio" estas dando una valoracion a las miradas que recibes. Me parece que de alguna manera es cierto, nos detenemos ante detalles muy peque?os antes de decidirnos a conocer o no a una persona, pero no te sintas mal porque ?valdría la pena cambiar tu forma de mirar? si alguien se toma la molestia de conocerte vale la pena, aquellas que pasan de largo, que se vayan por donde viniveron...|`|j52lF8Wnaa	Yo creo que la mirada expresa mucho de tí. En mi caso suele suceder que Yo traigo una gran revolución en todo mi ser y me enojo, me rega?o, me doy de topes y demás y de repente alguien llega y me dice: y ahora? a tí qué te pasa?. Entonces por más que trato de sacarme una sonrisa y hacer entender que no es nada en contra de nadie, que no se sientan mal y ya me concentro con quién estoy y disfruto el momento, y la compa?ía de la persona que tengo frente.<br>  Otras veces me he subido a un taxi, y el taxista me empieza a hacer plática y me dicen que porque estoy triste ó enojada ó contenta? Y pues sólo sonrio y trato de no ser grosera, pero prefiero no hablar mucho.<br>  Espero esto te sirva, para concientizarte un poco y no te sientas mal por ello, al contrario, aprender.<br>  Saludos|`|hgLwEV3Taa	NO LO CREO,TAL VES DESPIERTAS ALGO NEGATIVO EN PERSONAS QUE SIENTEN ENVIDIA POR TI <br>  NO CREO KE LA MIRADA DEMUESTRE LA PERSONALIDAD DE LAS PERSONAS,SOLO LOS ACTOS <br>  QUIEN SABE ,TE FIJASTES EN TU ATITUD HACIA LOS DEMAS '????????????<br>  PERO LA MIRADA NO MI AMOR ,NO LO CREO BESISSSSSSSSSSSS|`|ce339b53dd0f9ff135bcf41750750041aa	si eso es cierto|`|fc4ff0c37e21473f147dabbf8da3c20aaa	pues eso depende de la persona que te mira pero no eso de la personalidad mentira|`|hO4TdoH0aa	si es cierto, yo tambien sufro de los mismo...

45749f50f8eda4d908230c1c17f07a80aa	If this will help and you are sure your sister didn't take the money. Let me ask you a few questions. Was there anyone else in the house the before they left? Was there anyone that had been in the house say a few days before they left that new they were fixing lo leave?Did they do any buying on there way? Are they sure they had that much? To prove to your mum that she didn't take money it may help to go to the police. It really sounds like they think she really took the money and nothing will change there mind. Also who accused her first your mum or her husband? Think about my questions do a little asking  yourself. Maybe they forgot they may of spent it  and now they feel foolish and don't want to admit it. I'm sorry they don't trust your sister. I hope that I may of helped you some way or another.Before you go to the police try yourself to get to the bottom of it.Hopefully things will come out ok.GOOD LUCK|`|de6c9d3ae305ef33e2004ae7755cf852aa	Going to the police is not going to solve the missing money within the household.

kTgh1DYuaa	No todas, he tenido muchos orgasmos pero no tengo la habilidad de tener eyaculación femenina(ese es el liquido al que te referis),ese liquído es orina en su estado puro y por lógica sale por la vejiga, no tiene ni olor, ni sabor pero solo algunas mujeres pueden eyacular cuando acaban y no hace ninguna diferencia en la sensación( que eyacule no significa que goce más que una que no lo hace), igual muchas que eyaculan se sienten incomodas porque la sensación es la misma que cuando te orinas.

Somos un conjunto de emociones, conocimientos, sentimientos y experiencias que nos hace ser bellas de una manera única.  Ninguna mujer es capaz de sentir como lo hace otra porque no somos igual que otra, y eso no significa que seamos mejores o peores que otra, pero somos especiales a nuestra manera.<br>  <br>  Porque mientras algunas son bellas al sonreír, <br>  otras son bellas al permanecer serenas.<br>  cuando están despiertas o cuando duermen, <br>  cuando observan o mientras son observadas.<br>  Porque mientras la timidez de unas es su mayor atractivo, <br>  la espontaneidad y dinamismo de otras es lo que las define<br>  porque las que llevan un estilo sencillo llaman la atención<br>  tanto como aquellas que son más llamativas.<br>  Son bellas naturalmente sin maquillaje<br>  pero también cuando se toman el tiempo de lucir espectaculares.<br>  Porque las que tienen los pies en la tierra son bellas<br>  como también las que viven de sue?os e ilusiones<br>  porque son bellas las que duermen 8 horas<br>  y también las que logran ver el sol sin dormir.<br>  Son bellas al nacer, son bellas al crecer<br>  al hacerse se?oritas, al hacerse mujeres<br>  al procrear otras vidas y al envejecer.<br>  Porque son bellas cuando hablan mucho<br>  y también cuando no permanecen calladas<br>  cuando dicen: lo quiero todo<br>  o cuando dicen: me conformo con lo que tengo<br>  cuando buscan alcanzar las estrellas<br>  o cuando sólo quieren ver a otros felices.<br>  Cuando son egoístas o cuando su vida por otros<br>  cuando estamos solas o cuando estamos bien acompa?adas<br>  cuando con comprendidas perfectamente <br>  o cuando son incomprendidas<br>  cuando son sumisas o cuando sonrebeldes<br>  cuando aman o cuando dejan que alguien las ame<br>  cuando perdonan o cuando se les hace difícil dar ese perdón<br>  cuando tienen mucho y cuando no tienen nada<br>  cuando entregan todo lo que sienten en un solo día<br>  o cuando guardan sus sentimientos para ma?ana.<br>  Cuando te regalan una mirada o cuando fingen ignorarte<br>  cuando sus penetrantes ojos buscan encontrar tu alma<br>  o cuando buscan que te encuentres con la suya.<br>  Cuando te regalan un beso de lejos<br>  o cuando te lo brindan muy de cerca,<br>  cuando te regalan un abrazo o cuando te hacen esperar para dártelo ma?ana.<br>  <br>  Cada mujer es una joya por descubrir para un hombre, porque existe una mujer perfecta para cada hombre,  aunque muchas veces no somos capaces de mirar con los ojos del corazón, nuestro corazón siempre sabe lo que necesitamos, pero nuestra vista y conocimientos suelen cegar lo que nuestro corazón quiere.  También el miedo de vencer lo que nos estorba  y puede entorpecer nuestra felicidad, el miedo de arriesgar lo que tenemos, el miedo a cambiar, miedo a empezar de nuevo o miedo a fracasar o ser exitosos.<br>  <br>  Creo que me extendí un poco en mi respuesta pero necesito muchas flores hoy y cada palabra cuenta por una.

owzFxSjeaa	A lot of times when people get married there are a lot more demands on there time and you don't have the time to do things you use to do.<br>  Your friend is worried you don't have time for her any more.<br>  You said you call her every day Does she call you?<br>  I think you are doing a lot to try and keep her as a friend and if she is really your friend she will under stand that your time is limited. You could invite her to dinner the three of you. Or all three of you go out some time. You could go out just the two of you and leave the fiance home (Ladies night out) <br>  As for expectations the only expectations you need to try to fill are your own don't worry about what everyone else expects. The only thing important is what do you want.|`|9iLY49hYaa	Hey, why don't you arrange to meet with her like over lunch or coffee and explain to her what's been going on.

You mention that your childhood was filled with abuse and stuff like that.  I think you should get yourself straightened out before you consider having a relationship with a guy.  I say this out of concern for you because, typically, women, who have had abuse in their past, settle for guys who abuse them.  I would not want you to do that to yourself.  So please talk to a therapist about your issues and get yourself better.|`|AA11933435	A man can love such a girl... but... how much of that baggage that she's carrying with her, is she going to saddle him with?<br>  <br>  How much is she going to make him pay, or endure, for what other people did to her, or life did to her, that isn't his fault?  It's not fair... to make someone else pay for those things, when they're not at all at fault.<br>  <br>  Such a woman... has to realize that she can be desirable, but not if she forces a guy to handle all of the baggage she is carrying into the relationship.  It's not fair to him, or to any woman if a man brings in the same thing.  It's just not right.<br>  <br>  Such a woman... must resolve to start over, fresh, and without all of that baggage being carried in and dumped on him.  She must decide that that baggage will not run what remains of the rest of her life, to move on, clear of all of that.  She must decide that things can indeed be better, if she were to leave all of that behind.  That... is what she should do.<br>  <br>  All of that baggage... isn't an issue if she leaves it behind, forgets all of it, and NEVER brings it up- to give the guy (or gal) an even chance.

You can't really comprehend how much of an impact a bad childhood can have unless u've experienced it yourself. I've been through some hellish stuff, and dated some girls who have gone through the worst. As long as they are strong enough to move on, and can find the ability to trust the one they are with (provided they deserve it), I see no reason why a woman can't be as beautiful as she would be if she had a perfect childhood.|`|T4wludugaa	If you can treat him well, he can treat you well, no matter your past.<br>  <br>  If you can't treat him well, seek therapy.

AA11933435	You made the right choice, I believe, but you didn't say that you discussed with him... how you felt about that.<br>  <br>  Tell him that him just demanding sex like that, was rude and unfeeling.  Tell him that you think about him in was that go beyond sex, and that sex is only part of it.  Tell him, how you told us, how you felt about what he did.  Tell him that it's wrong to start a conversation by first suggesting sex.  Tell him... that you want to know that he feels more about you... than the sex that he can get from you.<br>  <br>  Tell him that you have other needs, and that he should address them equally.  Love and sex... aren't the same thing, and that the sex is better if he's actually interested in the all of what you are as a friend and lover.  If he has a heart, and his love is real, he'll understand.<br>  <br>  And... if he doesn't understand, or what you tell him makes him 'angry' or defensive, then... you're with the wrong guy, in my opinion.<br>  <br>  ` Jon|`|7a66efbf62d78c5a4f868f4cf648e85daa	You absolutely made the right choice..|`|kSDXgT6Paa	I think you were right in saying that.  My boyfriend in high school all he wanted to do was have sex, it got to the point that I tried to always have friends around, he got a little better furthur in the relationship.  Just stand your ground, if you want to have sex at that time then have it, if not then don't.
RK9bJPOmaa	get a new one. he already broke ur trust, so if u try to get back with him, he will say no. or he might say yes, and cheat on u again. well good luck.|`|AA11933435	The answer is obvious.  Get another boyfriend- and right away.  He's a dog.   Leave him.<br>  <br>  ~ Jon
AA11933435	Ummm... do I know him, like a friend... or is he uninvited and stealing my new LCD TV???  LOLOL :-)<br>  <br>  Well... I have shared, and I am up for that, as long as my gal is the sharing kind too, and brings one of her girlfriends over on occasion :-)  Oh, I'm such a free spirit, but I can be VERY devoted too.  Depends on the situations and amiable sircumstances in my life, over time.<br>  <br>  But don't mind me, I'm a polyamorist, and I believe that everyone should love everyone else.  It kinda promotes peace, ya' know, and love... is for everybody :-)   And yes, I am a free-love advocate, true, but I have also had strictly monogamous relationships as well.  Good ones.  It always depended on who my partner was.  I for one, am very flexible when it comes to such things, and go with the flow.<br>  <br>  Anyway- that's my answer :-)  Hope you liked it :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jon|`|l5Ao3VrDaa	never gonna happen.  not good at sharing.|`|72456c16193058e51f02d8cc06ddc8bbaa	HeII NO!!

75GcSkF6aa	You need romance...He doesn't care<br>  <br>  Yall are on different vibes....you can't force romance from him because then there would be resentment in having to do something.....If it is something you demand from a man....find one that is romantic|`|AA11623203	If your boyfriend is not romantic by now after 5 years it is doubtful that he will be unless you can find a way to help him ignite the spark again.  Or was it ever there in the first place?? Don't show him what to do since he is not interested.  Just pay more attention to the way you look and try to get involved in creating a life outside of your boyfriend and maybe he will start getting more interested in you besides just for sex and friendship.|`|AA11933435	What you're trying to do... is mold a person who is one way, into a different person than he really is.  You can't turn a non-romantic... into a romantic.<br>  <br>  Romanticism can be learned... but only by those that are cabable of learning it, and want to be that way.  If doesn't care to be reomantic, is is unable to be, then... he can't, and it's as simple as that.<br>  <br>  One of the WORST and COMMONEST things that happens in relationships, is when one person tries to shape and mold and change their partner.  That is stressful, difficult, and it usually fails, and it is often the cause of many relationships failing, and badly.  You just can't coerce or force a person to be... something that they are not.  That is 'controlling; and most people don't like that at all.  And if you continue... you may lose him.<br>  <br>  Then problem, really, is with 'you', for not hooking up with the kind of man that you want.  You chose a non-romantic, when what you wanted is a romantic.  You may a poor choice, having been attracted to him for other reasons, whatever those reasons may be.  You made... a mistake.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I'm speaking the truth, and you may not like it and vote this as the best answer, but that doesn't really matter.  What you are demanding from him- is wrong- and you are destined to fail, and miserably.  The simple truth is... you just can't force a person to change to your liking.  You have to choose someone whom is ALREADY to your liking.  Simple.<br>  <br>  Think about it.  How would you like someone to try to force or coerce changes, in you?  Not a pleasant thought, and until that happens, you won't know how it feels.  Or perhaps... you already do, and have forgetten what that feels like.  Anyway, you won't get what you want.  Even if you do, by some miracle, making him into a romantic... will be phoney for him,  His romanticism won't be 'real' or 'genuine'.  He would just be 'acting' romantic, not being genuinely romantic.  It's like trying to force someone to like you, or love you.  Forcing it... doesn't make it real, in any way.<br>  <br>  You've chosen the wrong man, with qualities missing, that you desire.  He may be a fine person otherwise, good and devoted, decent and respectful, clean and loving, and a good provider, but the 'romantic' that you want... just isn't there, and you cannot inject him with it.  Can't happen.  You want a 'real' romantic'... but you're trying to built one.  That won't be 'real'.<br>  <br>  Just my oninion, but a very well-informed one.  So- good luck.<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich

DXSA1IlBaa	you could get charged for indicent exposure...but if your careful you wont get caught...i know this is weird but i had a friend who did it with her boyfriend in the field of a publice park...and people were walking/running on this path that went right by them...i wouldnt suggest doing that...but if you are a little bit smarter than my friend you should be fine!!! hehe good luck!!! <br>  oh...going up in a plane and setting it on autopilot and then doing it would be pretty exciting to me...then no one could catch you..you'd be in the air!! hehe i would go for that!!! lol|`|f572cd9e5284c6c84045096ffbd2aeb8aa	Well, as a flight attendant, I can tell you to put that plane on auto pilot.<br>   But still, you could lose your job.<br>  And remember, everyone can hear you over those airplane radios.<br>  Not cool.|`|AA12339883	I'd love to do the deed on the beach or in the countryside in a meadow full of fragrant flowers.  As long as no one is around.  Getting caught would be quite embarrassing.|`|AA11933435	Sex on a plane isn'r exactly 'public', unless you do it in front of everybody.  But yes, you can be charged with indecent exposure or with engaging in indecent acts in public, and that can mean court, fines, legal expenses, and possible real jail time :-(<br>  <br>  But why do you want to do it in public?  So that people can see you?  Well, if so, do it at home and invite some friends over to watch!  Believe me, they will, and true, some people think that it's kinky and exciting to be seen making love :-)<br>  <br>  But if what you 'really want to do, is make love 'outside' out in the natural open air, then... do it in some bushes, or in the woods, or in a freshwater lake or stream, or in the ocean just off the beach.  That's... kinda 'public'.  Just don't get caught by someone whom will call the police on you :-)<br>  <br>  Running naked through the woods, with your lover- oh... that's just great :-]<br>  <br>  ~ Jon|`|DpAeGOdMaa	I had sex while driving, and that is probably a worse idea than while flying (more things to run into). It was interesting when we came to the tool both. <br>  <br>  I think that sex in public is illegal in most places (maybe called lewd public behavior?) so don't get caught. Don't know about enforcement or penalties though.

t0KAgdqpaa	There could be multiple reasons for whats going on.<br>  First email the best friend and ask those questions. Why doesn't the ex tell you this, why is he doing the dirty work, does the ex even know he's doing this etc.<br>  If your ex has no idea ask if its alright to talk to the ex about him telling you to do these things.<br>  Watch his reaction carefully. <br>  Then go to your ex with the emails and show him and talk to him about them. If your ex cares about you and wants you back he will take advantage of this and tell you the truth. If not, he won't care and say his friend is being an a$$hole or something. <br>  Then you have to ask yourself. Do you still care for your ex? Do you want to try again.

Creo que Nadia es un poco extremista, creo que tu pareja si mere una explicación, pues ambos han vivido los mejores momentos de sus vidas, puesto que por algo aún siguen juntos. Lo más conveniente es que busques un momento en ti para armarte de valor y con la cabeza fría (y tocándote un poco el corazón) le digas ?hasta aquí! Pero explicándole el porque de las cosas… cuando se ama de verdad, puedes entender todo por muy doloroso que sea, ya que con el pasar de los a?os lo que menos queremos es ver sufrir a la gente que amamos.

sCOAEQgwaa	Darling, you do not have to have a landing strip! <br>  <br>  Do like I do my hubby, because I get tired of dental floss, take scissors and just trim them puppies short! <br>  <br>  You will still have hair, just not long and crazy like a wild hare! <br>  <br>  LUCK N BLESSINGS|`|AA11933435	Even though it's up to you, what she is asking of you is not a bad request, or an unfair one.  Part of 'love'... indeed involves accommodating your lover.  Be flexible, and that's not a hard request to honor, especially if 'she' wants to do it for you.  For some women, trimming a man's hair down there is a real turn-on.  And don't you want to turn your gal on?  Yeah... I thought so :-)<br>  <br>  Otherwise, what do you need your pubic hair for???  The only purpose it serves... is to hold your genotal scent, and if it holds your scent... it also holds your 'stink'.  And for many women who perform oral sex, it tickles their nose and face... terribly.  That's a bad distraction for some, and a turn-off for oral sex.  Also... who wants loose hairs in their mouth?!?!<br>  <br>  It's kool, hygenic, and it's what she wants, and it's not a harsh demand.  Let her do it.  And if you don't want a 'landing strip', then tell her.  Communicate, and nicely.  Tell her she can trim and/or shave you, but no landing stip.  If you can accommodate her... then she can accommodate you :-)<br>  <br>  So, don't be an inflexible dweeb.  Show her that you love her... and let her do it :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich

So... ask him, whomever it is :-)<br>  <br>  Some like being kissed all over, or only on the lips.  The variables... are uncountable.  And consider this; Some men... don't like kissing at all!  As men, we're all different.<br>  <br>  ~ Jon|`|1fb97736cef1e51c1ee799fc2f22b523aa	The neck is good. Cleavag is good. Wrists are nice. Backs of knees...

But if your service is through Verizon or Qwest for an example, call them up and they will hook you up with an e-mail, it's included with your internet service, however it's not like yahoo or hotmail where everyone has one. You know?<br>  Hope that helps, just call your internet provider, they have one for you.
AA11933435	Back away from those fats, carbs and sugars.  That means no potato chips and no pasta and pastries, and drink water instead of soda pop.  No sugary drinks.  If you hafta eat meat, make it lean, and eat more fish and foul- steamed or baked, not fried!  Stay away from the greasy stuff.  And darnit, NO FAST FOODS!!!  AT ALL!   Yikes.<br>  <br>  You can actually stuff yourself with all of the fruits and veggies that you want and can stand.  Just don't cook them with anything oily-fatty.  Stir-fry is good if you use something light like 'Pam' cooking spray.  And all raw fruits/veggies are good for you.<br>  <br>  If you just change your diet like I described above, the extra weight will come off all by themselves.  Exercising more will help a lot too :-)  And take your vitamins regularly.  Compulsions to eat are driven by your body's vitamin and mineral deficiencies, pushing you to stuff your face with practically anything.  Oh... and just plain get rid of all the bad foods from your house.  Give it to the hungry homeless or donate them to a church or charity.  Most fire stations will accept random food donations :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich|`|8e56f53126294dd211f276deb293ba69aa	First of all, you gotta put the break up behind you. You can't lose any weight unless you are free of stress. Start a cardio program, eat healthier foods (NOT LESS FOOD, HEALTHIER), and go to training.fitness.com.

I think it's always the guy that gets nervous about that kind of stuff.  If you're worried about it, chances are that he's 10x more nervous than you are. Also, it might help to just tell him that it's your first time. He should understand.

AA11933435	One cannot emphasize enough the need for TRUST in a relationship, where love is supposed to be involved.  If a man is so insecure and so untrusting, then he isn't loving you, but possessing you, and sorely dominating you.  That's all bad.<br>  <br>  Without trust, there isn't love.  Period.<br>  <br>  My advice- leave him.  He will ALWAYS suspect you, no matter what.  Leave him.  He will never change.  Leave him.  You will have to deal with that nonsense for as long as you know him and are close to him.  Leave him.  This CANNOT work, ever.  Leave him.  There is positively nothing that you can do to change him, or make him stop.  Leave him!<br>  <br>  Did I suggest that you 'leave him'?  LEAVE HIM!!!

If it's Thanksgiving, it could prove problematic to talk for a couple hours, but as you said, it is in the middle of the night. Now that it's summer and we have nothing to do, my boyfriend and I talk just about every day, but it's usually in between 10am and 2pm. But if talking in the middle of the night works for you and him, then I think it's fine. As long as you aren't waking anyone else (if there is anyone) in the house up. One time durring Spring Break, My boyfriend and I talked for six hours on the phone. We were just bored and didn't have anything else to do. But I have one question. Are you calling him, or is he calling you, and how long have you been going out? (okay, I know that was two questions, but whatever.)  If it is still early on in the relationship, you should let the person who called end the conversation. (unless you have to go to the bathroom, or leave, or somthing like that) I don't want to totally give my age, but my boyfriend and I are still in school, and we have been dating for one year and eight months, so we've probably racked up at least a week in time spent on the phone.|`|EnEI9BG7aa	it shows that you like each other..do you have 10 minute good byes too?|`|J9RGGOnraa	no its not long you can stay on the phone as long as you want when it comes to having a boy friend|`|R82useiWaa	There's no time limit to be on the phone with your boyfriend!|`|Rt0UAjZsaa	no not really.i stayed up all night on the phone with my boyfriend from 10:00 pm to 4:00 am.it seems we had a lot to say|`|hxxwmCeJaa	If he shut up say good bay|`|rf6d4eqmaa	sometimes <br>  we say lets sleep together and fall asleep on the phone together, there is not a time limit to talking to your bf on the phone|`|zDqswPVAaa	Well it depends on what type of conversation  you are talking about with him if you see that the subject is kinda boring change the subject if thats don't job plan a day to see him and you're can talk about everything

rNS2rDIgaa	You make the decision that you won't let yourself get that wound up. <br>  <br>  Usually if I feel very strongly about something I will say "Ok, I am only going to say one more thing..." Then say my piece and end the conversation. If you feel yorrself getting wound up, say one final statement and then end it. No matter what the other person says just end it, because odds are you won't change each others view point anyway and the crying makes you appear to be using emotional guilt and theatrics.  used to do this alot so i only let the conversations last a short while... then I am the one to always end it so I don't get crazy.|`|7hi7GF8Baa	You having to become more stronger and not be so inocent.|`|AA11760259	It happens to me since the other person just acts as if its nothing and when im alone even if i get my point across and other person agrees i feel guilty or just feel emotional to cry <br>  so this is what i do when im putting my point across i try to tell myself im not going to cry and let this other person win i know its not that way but it keeps me in check and i dont cry|`|Cz4ZFQ6faa	Don't worry about it, as long you don't use it as a tool to get your way...if not, it just means you are a passionate person who feels things more deeply than others do... I'd be more worried if I couldn't cry!|`|AA11704793	I don't think that's uncommon. Practice role playing with a trusted friend, or by yourself in the mirror. Strong emotions about anything stir up lots of feelings. Don't be so hard on yourself.|`|QZ8zbkmZaa	I was the same way until way into my 30s.  I think when we are young, we still feel vulnerable and somewhat insecure.  With time, you get stronger and are able to deliver your passionate opinion without shedding a tear.  As  a young woman, I think I found it hard to stand up for myself.  Now ( at my advanced age :-) I say what I feel and the h*** with what the other thinks about it.  I tell you what, it works a lot better that way!  Don't worry, take a deep breath and tell yourself your opinion is valuable and you are a bright and passionate individual.  Anyone who can't appreciate that in you is an idiot!
AA11933435	It's perfectly normal.  Nothing wrong with it- since you gotta learn somehow.  So then, why not learn... from the 'professionals' :-)<br>  <br>  And I've seen a number of statistics that tell who rents adult videos the most often, and those stats tell that women rent more- and often to excite their own men when they bring them home.<br>  <br>  One survey tells that some 59% of adult video rentals are made by women.  Another told that it was 48%, and another told it was 63%.  It varied by area/city.  Many are no doubt renting them for themselves, or... for their men.  And they both often watch them, likely :-)  So, it appears to be  perfectly normal for the female of the species to have a similar interest :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jon|`|X8V8ixlMaa	The only girls who watch porn are pervs or sluts or ho's or a little of all three.

Are you planning on having sex now?  Have your parents had the infamous "sex talk" with you?<br>  <br>  As far as your question of "if i got horny, would that be normal?" Yes, normal.<br>  As far as your question of "normal for girls to do that?"  Yes.  You're just curious:  thats just like boys looking at dirty magazines.  <br>  <br>  Should you be doing this?  ......don't rush it, ok?  Sex needs to be considered a special thing.  This is whats wrong with kids now-a-days...they have no respect for themselves & will sleep with whomever, for whatever reason.   You shouldnt just give yourself out to anyone...You need to be in love- sex will be a lot better then since you have feelings for the person.  Meaningless sex is...well, meaningless.  People that actually have a conscious and have meaningless sex, feel terrible afterwards.  You feel cheap...  make sense?<br>  <br>  So...dont consider sex until you find Mr. Right.  Dont let ANYONE pressure you into sex.  No One!!!  Dont fall for the line "If you love me, then you will sleep with me," because thats BS! If they truly love you, they will wait for you and until your married.<br>  <br>  If you MUST have sex, be safe about it!  Use a condom and consider getting on birth control pills (BCP also helps with your period)|`|lxWn0Lf7aa	Sounds kind of 'forced' and unnatural. How old are you? Maybe you are too young. Surely, if you are of age and willing you have some thoughts and fantasies of your own, no? If watching porn is what you like, it is what you like.|`|ueT8I9YRaa	If you feel in your heart its wrong don't do it. I did not look at porn to learn what to do but each their own. Yes it may make you horny but it may also make you sick.

AA11933435	Such 'illness' can be brought on by doubt and a lack of confidence.  Hormones are powerful things, and it sounds to me that you're suffering from a kind of 'hormore overload'.  it's like... when in a situation when you're all fearful and angry, and you may begin shaking because of the adrenalin that's backing up, unused, in yiur bloodstream.  Something similar can happen relative to the natural chemicals in your blood and brain that surge when you are close to someone you're deeply excited about, especially when you're near them.<br>  <br>  The solution?  Learn... to relax.  Chill.  Think calm thoughts and quite simply... relax.  Try to not get so worked up and excited in the presence of the one you love.  Be cool.

1c670f1c433da3f539e0ad03719c4df1aa	Un trastorno como la depresión afecta el ánimo de manera radical y no como arranques emocionales que resultan de problemas particulares, los cuales generalmente , son de un tiempo mucho mas corto. <br>  Los síntomas centrales de la depresión son:<br>  <br>  ? caída del ánimo <br>  ? pérdida de energía e interés <br>  ? sensación de enfermedad física o debilitamiento <br>  ? baja concentración <br>  ? apetito y sue?o alterados <br>  ? disminución de las funciones físicas y mentales<br>  <br>  Además, muchos problemas físicos genuinos como dolor pre-cordial, indigestión, dolores de cabeza o periodos alterados, frecuentemente van de la mano con la depresión. Esto ocurre tan comúnmente que mucha gente se enfoca en estos problemas sin darse cuenta que están sufriendo depresión.<br>  <br>  Pero es probable que sean los sentimientos de:<br>  <br>  ? desesperanza <br>  ? desamparo <br>  ? culpa <br>  ? ansiedad<br>  ? tristeza<br>  <br>  Que también acompa?an a la depresión, lo que resulte más difícil de soportar. Una indicación de la profundidad de desesperación experimentada por quienes la sufren es el hecho de que la depresión es la causa más común de suicidio.<br>  Incluso así, es muy difícil para cualquiera que no tiene experiencia personal de depresión realmente entender el grado del problema. <br>  <br>  El siguiente relato escrito por un anónimo, que apareció en el British Medical Journal, ayuda a ponerla en perspectiva:<br>  <br>  "Un síntoma de los malos tiempos es que usted piensa que ellos nunca acabarán. Usted se convence a si mismo que está condenado para siempre a un estado de media vida. Usted despierta a un susurro y necesita un esfuerzo desmesurado para dejar la cama. Usted sabe que debe levantarse para detener el sentimiento de desesperación, pero la languidez que es una característica de la condición lo mantiene ahí, contemplando el techo con una mirada estática, reflexionando sobre el interminable día que nos espera. Todo significa un esfuerzo y se realiza lentamente. La tarea más peque?a es un peso para usted... Problemas menores se convierten en temas de gran magnitud. Las decisiones son postergadas y evitadas.

Tal vez ha perdido interés en cosas de las que normalmente disfrutaba. Si usted padece Depresión quizás haya perdido una parte de su capacidad para sentirse feliz, incluso si sucede algo positivo. Puede sentirse cansado y que le falta energía. Asimismo le puede resultar difícil pensar y tomar decisiones.<br>  <br>  ?Quién detecta los síntomas?<br>  En la mayoría de los casos, los primeros en darse cuenta de los síntomas de la Depresión son las personas más allegadas al paciente.<br>  <br>  Asi, por ejemplo, pueden darse cuenta que esa persona:<br>  <br>  Tiene un aspecto triste <br>  Se mueve y habla lo menos posible y, además, lo hace lentamente <br>  Tiene dificultades para tomar decisiones <br>  Tiene mala memoria o dificultad para concentrarse <br>  En otros casos, la Depresión se puede manifestar a través de Nerviosismo, Ansiedad, Confusión, e inclusive, Agresividad. Tal vez la persona se preocupe realmente por problemas que otros consideran peque?eces. ésta puede ser una de las razones por las que tanto la persona, como quienes le rodean no consideren que puede estar padeciendo de Depresión.<br>  <br>  ?Existen síntomas físicos o corporales?<br>  Algunos tipos de Depresión se manifiestan mediante síntomas físicos, tales como:<br>  <br>  Pérdida o disminución de apetito <br>  Dolor generalizado (sin que se pueda definir una zona específica) <br>  Hipocondría (preocupación exagerada por la salud física, o exageración de un dolor o padecimiento) <br>  Alteraciones del sue?o (dormir demasiado o muy poco) <br>  Los síntomas físicos, pueden llevar a la persona a creer que está padeciendo una enfermedad orgánica. Aunque es muy importante se?alar que, si bien muchas enfermedades físicas tienen síntomas similares a los de la Depresión, sólo un Médico puede hacer el diagnóstico preciso de Depresión. También hay que se?alar que las enfermedades físicas graves aumentan las posibilidades de desarrollar Depresión. Si la Depresión surge como consecuencia de una enfermedad física grave, entonces se dice que el paciente padece Depresión Reactiva.<br>  <br>  ?Cuáles son los síntomas más frecuentes de la Depresión?<br>  Si bien la Depresión puede manifestarse de muchas maneras, los síntomas más comunes son:<br>  <br>  ánimo decaído <br>  Tristeza <br>  Falta de energía <br>  Sin embargo, existe toda una serie de síntomas diversos que la caracterizan. Estos síntomas forman una pauta que es la base para un correcto Diagnóstico de la Depresión.<br>  <br>  Si sospecha que usted, o alguien que conoce, puede estar padeciendo una Depresión o si tiene síntomas físicos que no puede explicar, consulte a un Médico, él es la única persona que puede establecer el diagnóstico preciso y recomendarle el tratamiento adecuado, que le ayudará a mejorar su calidad de vida.
AA11933435	Don't... submit to pressure, as you perceive it.  When you feel pressured, that feeling is a manifestation of how deeply uncomfortable you are with the thing that someone is trying to pressure you into.  So, if it doesn't feel right, then in all likelyhood- it isn't right.<br>  <br>  If you have an adgenda, a plan, and dreams that you first want to see fulfilled, like finishing school, then follow that.  Ignore what's pressuring you and follow you dreams instead- follow through with the plan that you're comfortable with.  You have to follow your heart... not the things that people are trying to drive you to.  If you submit to such pressures... then you're not being honest with yourself.  Above all... to thine own self be true.<br>  <br>  Be... what you want to be, not what someone else wants you to be.  It's your life... not their's.  Don't let them change your own good plan for your life.  Follow... 'your' own dreams :-)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich|`|dIYj73zHaa	I think you should do what's best for YOU; people are always going to say what they want no matter what, but what's the point of living your life if everyone else makes your decisions for you.  I think you should find a balance in it all. If you find the right guy, then don't let you're goals of school and a good job consume your life so much that you don't give him a chance; don't feel like you have to force things to happen so you won't be alone, because being with someone you don't love I think is worse because you're not only cutting yourself short but also the person you're with- and I think that's really selfish. In sum I think you should continue what you're doing but make sure to be open to meet that special guy when he comes or you might lose him- let thinks happen naturally.|`|WriYeGrbaa	Sounds to me that you are pressuring yourself and within your mind really thinking and making a big deal about dating. You are in your twenties and at this point focus on your future.Like finishing school,career you want, and of course establishing a good future for you and your family. So go witht the flow and wait till love knocks @ your door and date. You dont have to have a bf if you dont want to. Or take it easy ina relationship to come. You wont end up alone b/c you are still young and yeah dont think like your 80 already. So relax and focu on your priorities and if a guy pops up then take it easy and show him what a great and independent lady you are.Power to us!!!!

K97JdO43aa	I think it would depend on the guy. I told wifey when I first met her that she was naturally beautiful, and she didn't need to wear "AS MUCH" makeup as she did. She respected my decision and wear less now. But females go through so much to beautify themselves, they forget how they use to look before they would put on the lipstick, the eye-shadow, lip liner, contacts and fake moles. <br>  Look in the mirror and see who you really are. Feel comfortable with yourself before you woory about how you think someone else sees you.|`|AA11933435	It depends on the guy, really.  But... it's girls that use TOO MUCH makeup that's the real problem.  Some gals really cake it on.  I mean... really :-/<br>  <br>  And it also depends on the girl.  Some need none, or very little.

And that's just total nonsense.  There is no such formula.  There is no formula to win over White women, Black women, or Latina women.  Period.  The answer you want simply does not exist.  You're asking for the impossible.  Think about it.<br>  <br>  A better question is... what about you, as an Asian, would be of interest to a Latina girl?  Do you know anything about the Latin culture?  Do you listen to Latin music?  Do you wear Latin clothing styles?  Do you... even speak fluent Spanish?<br>  <br>  All of the above are good questions, BUT... it doesn't mean that you have to stuff yourself into a Latino mold, and become something that you aren't.  As an 'Asian', you will never be fully viewed as a 'Latino'.  And... to try to behave like one, would be just plain, well... 'phoney'.<br>  <br>  The real task... is to find a Latina girl whom likes Asians.  They do exist, you know.  You need to be real about yourself, and just be yourself, and search out that Latina girl whom likes good, decent, honest, Asian guys.  You can't be something that you're not, so, just be yourself, and search out that Latina girl that is destined to meet you one day, and perhaps, if you're lucky, even maybe fall in love with you.<br>  <br>  Latina women, like ALL women, expect and deserve respect.  Don't look at them as sex-objects, just because they may have such a reputation in your view.  No woman is a sex object.  None are.  That's unfair, and just plain wrong.  All women are people, and are atracted to being respected, among other things.  But respect is important.  Attract them, like all women, with mature caring and decency.  Be nice.  Be polite.  Be a gentleman.  Be... respectful.  Those things in general- attract ALL women- as a rule.  And such things as 'romance' are entirely universal, and some say that Latinas are VERY romance-centric.  They come from a hotly passionate and romantic culture.  But... that can be said about many cultures.  Romance though is very universal.  Believe that :-)<br>  <br>  Otherwise, no one will be able to give you a formula or a plan as to how to attract just Latina women.  That's just plain rediculous.  All women, are people, and all deserve to be treated the same, and that's... respectfully.  And they all have to be approached in that same gentlemanly manner.  And always... with respect.  That Sir, is the real deal, and the only answer worth noting :-)<br>  <br>  Thanx for asking :-)<br>  <br>  ~ Jonathan Rich|`|qPKB9tt1aa	rice and beans. then offer them a free firearm and then beat them senseless with an empanada.|`|OM6iZXtMaa	Learn how to dance, and do it well.

Learn things about him and get him to talk about himself. And current events are always a topic of conversation. Like the new movies out, or upcoming events, concerts etc.. talk about what projects you are working on or what happen in class or home or work.

Ask him how he feels about... 'you'.  Does he like his mom and dad?  If so, why... or... why not?<br>  <br>  Asks him what he finds exciting.  Ask him about places he's gone to, and tell him about places you've been, and what you did there.  Does he like school?  Plans for college?  Travel?  Ask him to tell you about his best friends, and tell him about yours :-)  And ask him questions that won;t provide just simple 'Yes' or 'No' answers- ask him things that he has to elaborate on.  And every answer elads to more interesting questions.  Show him... that you're interested in him.  Most guys like that :-)  Most guys, that is.  he may not be one of those.<br>  <br>  How about his favorite color, snacks, and meals?  His favorite style of clothes, or favorite kind of car?  Ask him why he likes such.  MUSIC?!?  What are his favorite singers, albums, and bands.  Websites?  Doe he like YouTube or eBay or MySpace?  How does he feel about art? Does he scateboard, ski or rollerblade?  How does he feel about politics... or God?  Religion?  What are his favorite video games, and tell him what yours are :-)<br>  <br>  Ask him... if knows... what 'love' means? :-)  Or ask him if he has a philosophy on life.  Many people do :-)<br>  <br>  Ask him anything, but tell him... the truth.  Honesty is very important.  Let him come to know the 'real' you :-)  And if he doesn't appreciate that, then... he's not the guy for you!  Keep looking then :-)  You're young.  You have the time, and the energy :-]  Be patient :-)<br>  <br>  Otherwise, 'silence' is a bad thing.  It's usually a sign... that he's not truly interested.  Remember that.  That hurts, but it's too often very true.  You may have to keep looking for the right guy.  Sorry.  Life is like that, even if you may not want to hear that.  Just accept it as a possible fact.

You've already confronted him and he's said he won't do it again, so you have a couple of options. You can just trust him to not do it again, or you can avoid him to try and make sure he doesn't confuse your feelings any more than he already has. <br>  <br>  On another note, him calling you to talk about your past and grill you about your whereabouts is kind of out of line. Even if you guys plan to stay friends, you may want to politely tell him that it isn't really his business. Remind him that you are no longer his girlfriend. If you want to talk to him at all, you might want to tell him that you don't want to talk about your past together. It's over and done with, and rehashing it serves no useful purpose. <br>  <br>  It sounds like this guy is being kind of immature and wants to have the perks of a relationship without the commitment. You deserve better than that. You ALWAYS have the right to say "no" when a guy wants to hug or kiss you, and even when he just wants to rehash your history together.|`|tD5OJI84aa	Seriously, this guy needs to stop playing mind games with you. It's not fair that you both obviously still have feelings for each other, but he doesn't want to further your relationship anymore. I would either tell him to make up his mind and stop messing with your emotions, or you'll find better , because most likely, thats what you deserve.

Esas mujeres que so pocas, pero las hay. Muchas veces ese tipo de mujeres no las encontramos en las mas esbeltas, algunas veces las encontramos en las mas retraídas.<br>  Recordemos que muchas veces las belleza interior es mejor que una estética dedicado a lo de afuera, pero con rollos en el yo interno.<br>  Yo hasta el momento no me he decepcionado con ninguna de las mujeres que he conocido, pero si me arrepiento de haberlas conocido, por el hecho de haberlas dejado o ilusionado.<br>  Pero siempre he sido su amigo, capas que con algunas he tenido otros privilegios.

Invece mantenere lo stato di innamoramento nei confronti di una persona in eterno non è possibile.La si può stimare,essergli fedele,ecc..ma le sensazioni iniziali che hanno una durata fisiologica,e che qualcuno interpreta come amore,sono destinate ad affievolirsi. Questo non credo che debba scoraggiarti,ne tanto meno farti passare la voglia di provare tale sensazione per paura che poi finisca.La cosa migliore da fare secondo me è prenderne coscienza.Trovo troppo facile scegliere una persona proprio nel momento della massima euforia,mentre per capire se veramente è possibile fare un percorso in comune bisognerà attendere proprio il complicarsi della situazione. Ti consiglio di provare,<br>  senza paura a metterti in gioco,ma con la coscienza di chi già sà che i rapporti sono un grande punto interrogativo.|`|A1Yoqn0Aaa	l'amore è eterno?io sn sempre innamorata del mio ex che mi ha mollatae stà cn altra <br>  è 3 anni che ci sn innamorata mi sembra un'eternità|`|AuOec2sUaa	Se intendi l' amore come innamoramento e tutti i sentimenti correlati :passione sconvolgimento il batticuore allora assolutamente no ,poi diventa affetto ,interessi condivisi, figli condivisione di problemi e gioie.

eh5pBKrbaa	Of course they can do a speech if they want to but if you don't want to I don't think an entire speech is required.  You should definately get up with your husband and thank your guests for coming, show your appreciation to anybody who helped make the wedding happen and let the guests know how much their prescenece means to you.  If you are super shy you can kinda tag team this part and have your new husband say some.  Here's example:<br>  <br>  Introduction as you enter reception, do your first dance as man and wife, then go up on stage.  "Wow!  Thank you all for coming, its nice to see so many of you have taken time to help us celebrate the beginning of a new chapter in our lives.  We would like to take this opportunity to thank our parents, the bridal party who spent all those hours licking invitation envelopes, and our friend Carol who set us up on our first date all those years ago....without your help this day wouldn't have been possible.  Seeing all the love and support in this room from you guys truly puts the icing on the cake and our wedding just wouldn't have been complete without you.  So!  Lets eat some of this great food, I know my stomach's rumbling, and really get this party started!"|`|6ebEgWewaa	I have never seen this done. I know for sure I didnt do it at mine, nor did my best friend at hers.<br>  Must be something new.|`|iBRfjO1Eaa	No, everybody else takes care of that.  It's the bride and grooms day.  All they need to do is soak in the joy of the beginning of the rest of their lives together.|`|vFF2cEHfaa	I was recently at a wedding where no one gave a speech and it was just wierd, and kind of boring. It's nice just to say thank you to your guest and to let them know that you hope that they are enjoying themselves. And if you need to thank anyone, like maybe your parents, maybe you should do that too. But like everyone else says, 'it's your wedding'|`|04c253b960f18a18e08c3f3a5950ba67aa	I have been to weddings when the bride has not given a toast speech. However I was at one where both bride and groom thanked their guest for sharing in their day. It worked well because it was a mixed crowd. Groom thanked those in English and she pretty much reiterated the thanks in Spanish. Hope that helps. If you're stressing out because you feel you need to give one, then don't. Wedding planning is stressful enough.|`|KnCBgpXwaa	It is not mandatory for the bride to give out a speech because it is her day, so she can do whatever she wants :-)<br>  I've been to several weddings where I didn't hear from the bride, mother of the bride or mother of the groom. The most common people I've heard are the maid of honor, the matron of honor, best man, groomsmen, sometimes father of the groom and/or bride.|`|NE5N7CgEaa	It's her day she can do whatever she wants!!|`|POJTsxFVaa	The bride does not have to  give a speech, but they can if they want to!|`|f15fc526bc5ecc91462413bc78a559efaa	I didn't, but I kind of wish I did.  I was so busy on the wedding day, that I didn't get to talk to half of my family and friends!  And it was a destination wedding in Vegas!  However,  I would have had too much on my mind, and  I probably would have sounded like a jackass anyway :)<br>  <br>  It's not necessary - just be sure to send thank yous to everyone that attended - Gift or no gift :)|`|nohkX2qgaa	the bride giving a toast is in no way mandatory.  normally the best man and/or maid of honor will toasts, along with a few family memebrs or friends.  if the bride and groom wish, either or both of them can give a toast of thanks to their guests.|`|sEWfgnfJaa	It's not necessary.

Otherwise, I didn't have one at mine (2 years ago) and another wedding I went to didn't either.|`|yJ9K1gakaa	I've been to numerous weddings lately and I haven't heard the bride, or the mother of the bride give a speech.

oFfnDideaa	When is your wedding? If it's after the Holidays you can pick up these lights for 75-90% off and use them if your wedding is next year. I haven't seen the hall completely covered in lights on the ceiling. You can also by tulle and string the lights through that. If not icicles would be your best bet. If you try to cover the entire ceiling it will cost you a fortune.|`|ETgvd9Euaa	Ask the hall, most likely they've either had it done already or know of someone local you could ask.  If your hall doesn't know, ask the DJ service. You'd be surprised at how much information they have available to them and how much they have seen over time.|`|vFF2cEHfaa	wow maybe I should have read this one before I answered your other question. Have you tried covering the lights with the fabric??? I asked the women that runs the place that I'm getting married at, how she did it, and she said, all she did was got some christmas lights and covered them with the fabric. But I guess it always depends on the fabric. If your using an aisle runner like you said, then it might not work as well. I would say take the lights that you have and run over to a fabric store, and ask for some help. Pull some different fabrics and plug in the light and then drap the lights in the fabric.|`|MoJ62nmJaa	Have you tried icicle lights maybe going around the outside and maybe crisscross them in the center?

I mean thats a big step all in itself, and then later on, if your still friends, then maybe tell him how you feel.|`|oUtEVKDHaa	yea like the another person said, first you need to tell him ur gay! see his reaction and then, think if you should tell him you have feelings for him. i'm sure that's a really hard thing to do if you say he's sord of homo-phobic or something. good luck|`|xNs7wLaCaa	Hes probably too afraid to admit it himself yet take it slow.|`|5kTILEIDaa	hmm id say see if like try to act a little like u have feelings<br>  for him and see if he freaks out or not. if its okay with him then.<br>  yahh anyways i think u should tell him if he was ur true friend<br>  Best Friend he will accept u fir who u are.|`|R6A1kCLdaa	tell him how you feel and, if he don't respect that then thats his lost.
de3668e40ae13d7fac9d07a7d550aaf7aa	awww lol pick one special boy to flirt with like the nicest or something(i know its hard to though) and flirt with him or maybe switch around every few days! lol<br>  good luck|`|21MUkAluaa	uhmmm you just sound like a Hore i no just get back to work and stop flirting|`|2K7YqxKYaa	What kind of advice is this for a 5th grader??? You are WAY too young to be acting the way you are. Get back to playing with your dolls!|`|cfPLgxVJaa	well... you got to figure out who you like the most... and figure out who likes you i mean your in fifth grade usally youngesters like yourself dont have a boyfriend till there in middle school but like i said up there....just pick out the one you like most and if he doesnt like you then just sat f&$k you and move on lol|`|vGjwfeOcaa	haha well don't lead all of them on, then you'd get at least nine of them with broken hearts! just try to be friends with all, if not most.|`|viNbNMp0aa	wow u must be really hot|`|xk96oAAaaa	You're in 5th grade. While it's not my place to tell you when you're old enough to date, I do think it should be a couple years before boys while begin to share your enthusiasm, anyway.<br>  Remember-- boys mature later than girls, so if they'd rather not think about dating yet, don't take it personally.|`|otPsBn89aa	Hey dude(?), I liked a girl when I was in 5th grade. I'd probably just tell them. Guys love it when girls say they like them. I'm in 7th grade now and I hate the girl. Ah, middle school has so much hotties wait till you get there. Girls are hotter in my opinion the boys are dicks usually.|`|c1c0e4322e67e6f7dd7a4e7eed6054daaa	Well in 5Th grade that is normal to have crushes on boys, but i think you need to stop flirting and concentrate on school and not boys. Maybe you could just like one boy at a time instead of 10. Tell one of them you like him and see how that works out first.
vFF2cEHfaa	tell your friends that they are stupid and then when they're in the hospital for a broken rib tell them 'i told you so'.
vFF2cEHfaa	Call him Honey. It's a lot sweeter then baby, and a lot more grown up.|`|7PmtCSzLaa	Hunk<br>  Guy<br>  Boy
vFF2cEHfaa	so why are you with him?|`|ixeIzWk5aa	He seems like he is a bum and likes to use people to get a free ride in life.  I'm assuming he is an adult, so he needs to take on responsibilty and get a taste of life by buying his own food and managing his money.  He also needs to be a real man and learn how to treat a women.  I would dump him and move on, or else you might have to support him for the rest of your life.

3wfmErTAaa	Do not assume things so quickly, let some time go. You will come to know yourself whether you like him or he likes you.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Vish|`|0s2SBakvaa	You really shouldn't assume that since he looks at you and talks with you means he likes you, I mean i talk and look at my bro when we have class together, but i don't like him (in that sense, lol). Let things progress naturally, and it should work out.|`|EeYUQuzaaa	either he thinks your ugky or funny looking...or he thinks you r hott...and he is thinkin of ways 2 get wit u|`|imSePQZaaa	I agree with Vish.<br>  ....but it does sound like he likes you.   :)
87a97307eb84f6b093dc19657dda478aaa	Sorta, I mean obviously there's something about you he finds attractive if he wants to talk to you, but he cant really like you if he doesn't know you. If he does call you, one way or another you'll find out what he's interested in.<br>  <br>  Do you have an older sister, a parent or someone with experiance you can trust to watch your back while your kicken it with this guy? As you confide in them they can be an extra set of eyes to help you determine what about you he's interested in.<br>  <br>  Take care of yourself.|`|3549cdff1d3b84339cad5493bfde13fdaa	I know your soooo excited to know but ur gonna have 2 see if he calls you...he probably does like you tho!!|`|Ym6rACTsaa	He either doesn't care about you or he is crazy about you and playing indifference to you thinking it's cool.|`|glzykixsaa	this girl ask for my number and she hasnt called me lol. But I think she likes me this year from what friend say. So wait for him to call u lol.|`|524bZ8JGaa	maybe!|`|JLjXzvieaa	I think that he maybe have some interest about you,but it hard to act when all around are yours both friends!!!|`|JQwoM5Txaa	i think he likes u.|`|fRXzKrbtaa	if he calls, then yes. but from the way he was mostly focusing on his friends, im not to sure. just wait for his call. =]|`|jcfd9LZmaa	Yeah, i think he likes u.|`|vFF2cEHfaa	It sure does sound like he does. he could have just said 'I dont want her number'. But nope, he gave a reason for not being able to talk to you.|`|vhxgdPKjaa	depends what he is like he could off just said that thinking you wouldnt give him your number just so he could shut your bff up|`|HvWwjnLFaa	time will tell see if he calls you.|`|M1d1KREIaa	yep, that was his smooth way of saying let's go out and get to know each other some time. Guarenteed
vFF2cEHfaa	If it's only been a week or less, give it time. He's moving, and getting settled in not only his new home but job as well. Don't expect, ANYTHING.... EVER!!! call him and if you two don't get the chance to see each other, well then there is always next time. But dont stop your life and what your doing for anyone.|`|2D72mjhiaa	Well he's obviously attracted to you...and interested sexually.  However, I don't think he's interested in a serious relationship otherwise he would have asked you out before he moved.  My guess is he's looking for a booty call when you go visit.  Beware & good luck.
fOg70Fk1aa	ddaaahhhh hi me wats up choose me for best answer|`|RdUggxwNaa	Can you say pedophial?|`|UFn1E8azaa	ummmmmmmm that IS really weird. srry. but normally girls r attracted to guyz OLDER than them. not 5 yrs YOUNGER. ew|`|vFF2cEHfaa	This took me a very long time to answer. I looked at it from your shoes and mine and this little kids. And there's not a whole lot of things I consider to be wrong, but this is one of them. If you were 25 and he was 20.... that's one thing, but he;s what, like 10, 11 at the most??? And your 15 maybe 16. He's a child, and your a teenager. Date guys your own age... for now, untill your about 23.... then if you want to like a younger guy, it's legal.|`|aWyKglIOaa	eew.........5th grade? he probably weighs like 55lbs. Have fun waching barney and elmo with him.|`|j2gILZmraa	you can think he's cute but not like him! that's nasty. imagine how awkard it'd be for him!|`|miXX41l3aa	You should try and focus on what you like about this boy, it's not illegal but I don't think the relationship will satisfy you, I'm sure you only like his looks because kids that age are still playing with transformers.<br>  Try and look for kids older or your age that you like, dating is so much fun and you will get to know a lot of people. <br>  If you're confused try writing about it and then get rid of it, express your feelings and try to understand them.|`|rQbHmDJVaa	itis kind of wierd liking a fith grader why dont you loo at the frehman the are younger than you.|`|sTQujzF0aa	you sicko<br>   what the hell is wrong with you|`|vRvoFOCOaa	Not gross, but also not acceptable in or society either.<br>  And even though you are under 18, you could get in trouble in some states if you fool around together.<br>  I am an adult and have an attraction for 12 year old girls.<br>  But I do not act on my thoughts. <br>  I think it's normal, but most people either are not honest and try to go along with what everyone else says or just don't understand that thinking and doing are two different things.|`|hG1VNgubaa	It's kinda weird but I guess when you are 55 he will be 50 and that won't be gross! But whatever floats your boat I guess, I also know that his mommy won't aprove though!!!|`|48fe46bf80f77ce6456b7b712da12bdaaa	Geez he doesn't even have pubes yet. At least wait until he's in 7th grade or something.
7yKbvJ1Paa	Well thats a toughie.lol. I would say yes cause its your mom|`|b8b956b2b276b131498b783b5850e58aaa	First of all, she is not your parent and did not HAVE to buy you a car. Second of all, you should respect her. You should try to get along with her. When you turn 18 you can move out and do whatever you want.|`|PTjjRiTDaa	First off i would say yes you must always respect your elders. But you should try kindness sometimes it what they dont like and throws them off balance.|`|cmbnjNREaa	I had a mother-in-law like dat she would constantly give give help here there den out of no where she bug out ... <br>  look if u old enough 2 move den move

She's insecure for some reason.  She's afraid that no one will notice her unless she points out that she's got a good grade or a nice body or whatever.  She sounds really insecure.  I would sit down with her and point these things out.  Ne very polite as she's fragile.  And show her by ezample.  If you get a good mark don't make a big deal out of it.  Maybe tell her if she asks but don't volunteer it.  She needs your companionship.  Try to stick with her and help her out.  Good luck!|`|Ba5FIiJ0aa	In my opinion I would confront your friend to see what is up with hero, as it  sounds that she is very insecure and all she needs is a little push. She could be using her emotions (bossyness)and the challenges as a barrier to hide something away from you. So what I would say is sit down with her and have a nice long chat to see if she's got any problems. don't force the answer out just let the answer come to you. <br>  .<br>  Good Luck.

Don't do drugs or drink. That is wasting your life. No offense. Talk to them and make them see your side of things. You might not love life but they are only a part of it. Hang out with your friends and talk to them about your problems! Your only 14 so don't do drugs and drink! Just try to make your parents see your side.|`|QuLfrN5Zaa	You are silly - drinking, drugs, cigaretts over a boy!!!!   And you are only 14!!!!    If I was your parent you would be grounded indefinitely.  Boys of 14 or 15 or 16 are fickle.  They are not ready for "relationships"   How do I know?  Because I have 3 of them - now 16, 19 and 21.    Don't be so stupid over a young boy.  He will always wander, he will always want to be doing "stuff" with his mates and he will only come to you when he has nothing better to do.  You will only be a distraction inbetween cool stuff.  Sorry to be harsh, but you need to wake up young lady.    Talk to you mum, tell her what you are feeling - tell her about your drinking etc.  Yes, she will be mad and angry and furious, but she will love you, care for you and help you through it..   she is your mother..  Get this out in the open now, before it is too late.  Take the grounding, take the help and get over this rough patch.  Your life will be so much better.|`|VWSuuFhaaa	What are you doing with your life? Do you want to become a drug addict? It's only 2 days. Im grounded too, if you want to talk to someone talk to me. Im 14 aswell, I smoke and drink, but I never tried drugs, and to be honest I don't even want to. Because I value my life. If you feel very stressed because of this e-mail me [bulytia@yahoo.com] I'll try and help you, in fact we have a bit more than a few things in common =] Good luck, and I'm waiting for your e-mail =)|`|emgIjPqMaa	wow. its  just english who cares.its one semester.<br>  altho its just a guy alot of people go thru this<br>  your parents seem to strict.<br>  goood luck!

Parece que os judeus usavam alian?as de casamento antes dos tempos crist?os.” — The International Cyclopaedia.<br>  <br>  Vê-se assim que é incerta a origem exata da alian?a de casamento.|`|bzBsCvvnaa	o significado era para ser algo inquebravél, sem ruptura, um elo sem solda, pois uma alian?a é dessa maneira e o casamento também era para ser assim, pois foi a unica institui??o criada por Deus, família.
7576ccf58b0f0d06d5465ee6303c37b2aa	You should be honest with your girlfriend and tell her why.  It sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.  It could cause you to lose everything.  Just get a part-time job and be peaceful at home!
apbuHIJOaa	The only way you can truly know if a person has feelings for you is to ask. By asking, you can be sure the answer is sincere as it came directly from said person.

Good luck!|`|aUDVBmZSaa	Well I'm a guy so I have limited knowledge on knowing whether a girl likes you or not, but I know how to approach a girl, First, give her eye contact and a little smile, if it happens again walk up to her confidently no hands in pockets and don't put your head to the floor. And as you approach if she starts grooming and stuff I think that means shes interested and wants you to talk to her.
vNlyRmB7aa	There's a book at Barnes & Noble that is called something like...Why I love you...or something like that. Anyway, it asks like 200 questions about the person you're with and you fill in all the reasons you love them, etc. Very cute!    Also, if you want to go cheap....buy a cheap frame at the dollar store. Print out a black and white photo of the two of you. Cut out colorful "love" words, etc from a magazine and glue them around the matting of  the photo or on the picture frame itself.

If it's less than a year and you're into a good relationship you could try a cute card, a special key chain (if he drives, or if he has a dream car), and a cute stuffed bear.  If it's been more than a year and all is good, try cooking a special dinner of his favourite foods a massage afterwards and then let your imagination run.  If it's been a few years, you should know him by now.  Tickets to his favourite sporting event, something his car might need, or if he lives on his own, something his place needs (like a picture frame with you and him in it).|`|yyLQTBJQaa	Cologne :D
hCIAD98Zaa	OMG ! buy her a braaaaa ! she'sssss madd ! ; )  A bra is like the most important thing in a girl's life .  Buy her one and just tell her to try it for a minute if she refuses still ask her to do it just so she can see how it looks . Like that she could see the difference between that and a training bra .     Those are for girls , we're talking about a teen here . Imagine what the boys say when they see her boobs pointy ! omgggggggg , so awful !     Well if it is a training bra and she's 15 then how about a 34-36 depending if she has larger or smaller ones .|`|dPULl5hjaa	Do you have any old ones to give to her?  That would help.

That way she could get a bra and get the right size.|`|U3iTIFdFaa	I would take her to a store that does free bra fittings (like J.C. Penny, Victoria's Secret and etc). After they tell her correct size, you can either buy her one or tell a grown up her situation. Maybe your mom could help out and buy her a couple. Walmart has nice bras that are inexpensive. All while this is going on make sure your friend approves and is comfortable with you doing this.
4eLLjTzzaa	On the list of the top five stressors in life you are hip-deep in three of them: job change, major move, and marriage.  Why wouldn't you be stressed?  Feeling stressed isn't necessarily a sign that something's wrong; just that things have changed--they aren't "normal" or within the range of your predictable meter.  Do not panic!  Feeling stressed is a legitimate feeling.  Find someone to talk to that you trust and respect and pour out your feelings.  All of them, dark and light, and remember your feelings can't harm you.  How you respond to your feelings can.  So respond to them by moving toward others who care about you and will give you a safe place to talk about your heart.    You CAN be alright!  Let people you trust help you be alright.|`|6WMOB0KHaa	Maybe because you feel so strongly that this SHOULD be the happiest time of your life, you are subconciously heaping pressure on yourself to believe it., just try to forget what you brain is thinking you "should" feel and relax, also try talking to a close friend or your partner about how you feel.|`|dIYj73zHaa	Happiness doesn't come from the outside, external things that we encounter in life (that's only temporary happiness), happiness comes by the way you approach life, and being realistic. No husband/wife, child, job, money etc. will ever satisfy you, or anyone; because happiness, true happiness comes from within, and the way you live, and think...it's a life long journey that everyone struggles with. In the end, we are alone in this world, but that shouldn't bring us down, but realize yes I have loved ones, people I love, and people who love me....but they aren't always going to do what I want, or save me from what I fear- I have to be the one, and not dependent on others, or things to make me happy because it doesn't last. Good luck.|`|F3RdW89baa	i agree, i think seceretly you do want a big fancy wedding.   because thats how i feel.   I've been married for about two years now and I did not get a wedding and i keep telling myself that its okay and that i dont need one but then every once in awhile i just blow up at my husband for never giving me one.  he keeps putting it off and its just making me feel more and more like   he just doesnt care enough about me to give me this beautiful wedding.   also   maybe its the stress of all that change at once you know.   llike your moving into a new place, you've got school to worry about again. its stressful. and change is hard.     just try your best and deal with everything little by little   talk about it to ppl, friends , family, or even just blog about it online.   it helps .  just dont let yourself go back to that bad place of cutting yourself again.|`|xdM1N6Wjaa	It is completely natural to be feeling this way, this coming from someone in the same situation aside from the marriage in 11 days. Change can cause anxieties- even if you like the changes that are being made. It can be really stressful and cause you to feel a little "unhappy" even though you are. It will pass - it's just a matter of getting used to everything and that you are moving from who you were to a new place, on a new level.     The cutting however- I've been there too and I know how addicting/habit forming/etc. it can become. I can't say that I relate to that right now, but I know how it feels to want to hurt yourself when you are in a good place. Just look in at yourself and see how amazing your life is becoming. Understand and embrace that you can be happy and good things can and are happening to you. It can be hard to see past the general idea that for every good thing 2 bad things will happen, but from my experience if you let good things happen- fully embrace them- you won't sabotage them, which for me has been a reason that it seems like things are so bad.     It sounds somewhat like you don't want to elope- maybe you should also consider having some sort of wedding ceremony- even if it's just taking all of your friends and family to dinner at a restaurant. Celebrate your marriage - in a non stressful way - because this is your one chance. There are many ways you can avoid stress while still  planning a time to share this time with those you are close to.    I hope you can find your happiness in all of the changes you are experiencing in your life. I know that it is hard but I'm sure that in time, if you are open to it, you can learn to appreciate everything that is going right for you.     And please don't cut. It will not help anything. Happiness comes from wading through the hard and looking at it in the face.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Talk to someone get different ideas. Talk to a counselor etc. someone that can be objective and not emotional|`|Rb087BsAaa	seek therapy.  you obvious have some unresolved issues and that's not fair to your new spouse.|`|y5P4dY7aaa	Maybe you should just find more things to help you keep occupied, help her with the weeeding plans, or go to therapy together they can help you there.|`|F447xl4gaa	i dont think theres anything wrong with you. you could be going through an anxiety/depression. you may not realize it but it you could be having anxiety thats causing you depression. i went through it myself awhile ago. maybe when you get married you'll feel alot better.|`|Bdo2GNA2aa	nothing,  just need therapy|`|iABAZj2Haa	i think subconsciously you are sad because of having to elope. Maybe part of you wishes that everything would be okay and have a normal wedding with all of your family there.|`|W618lfZ6aa	I had a friend who was a cutter, If you are having those evil thoughts again you need to go see a shrink, talk about it there will professionals.   You out of all people know how it can rule your life.    If you do not want to go that route try getting outside or go to the gym, get exercise, look at your diet also, that can play a role.|`|QT0qTFyAaa	Do you really want to get married?    Not that this is you, but I knew a girl once who "just wanted to get married" and said yes to the first guy who asked her. I am pretty sure she is divorced now.    I don't know why you are depressed, how's your finances and job situation? How is your family life? Did you see your doctor?|`|gqvvXknQaa	Do you get anxiety attacks or panic attacks? If you do, you might have something called "Adjustment Disorder". I went though a lot of changes in my life, such as going back to school, moving away from home, my parents got divorced, etc. I started to get unexplainable anxiety and depression. My doctor diagnosed me with Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety and Depression. When your body gets stressed out, sometimes you might get an anxiety attack as your body's way of releasing stress and tension. If you feel like you need some help, ask your doctor what options he has for you. I went on Paxil for about a year until my stress level evened out.

is4hA8eUaa	ask him on a spirit date  If either of you don't know what that is, watch the movie "The Lakehouse" (with Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock)    sending/getting emoticons don't mean a damn thing really, it's an empty language that conveys the tone of a message because texting someone has very little communicative value. So emoticons were invented to add a sense of funness.|`|AA11483933	Well if your friend lives in Scotland then it's going to be hard but not impossible. Just tell her to start a regular conversation and talk about stuff they usually talk about. Then tell her to ask him "I have a question to ask you".. then when he replies then she can ask him out. I'm sure that if he says no then they should work it out so their friendship is still there.

Say right I have to go.   My credits low and I cant not get a reply I get like this to a guy on msn   Just joke about it when you next see him.  Or be blunt and say :  if you dont like me just say.
ecNeN0staa	Aww, yo boyfriend's a playa, bi-atch!|`|RteBwg8laa	i think he is doing some with them i would dump him   he is a player|`|t4F59gf2aa	hahahaa your are  gf  2.  I would never be so ignorant to fall for that, were you born yesterdaym thanks for the laugh genius.|`|THuplVHpaa	Yea.. it sounds like he doesn't want to introduce you 'cause he doesn't want to interfere with his game (at uni).|`|0MunIx8raa	Yeah, my ex was this way and turns out he was screwing most of them.  Dump the guy.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Tell him that u can be a ***** right back...|`|SyHmExgtaa	Well if they're such bitches then why are they his friends?! Maybe it's just me but if he were my boyfriend he would no longer have lady friends besides family members...|`|m3H1A4W1aa	Maybe he just doesnt want your feelings to get hurt by those "bitches"|`|ZjiEQ3CGaa	brake up wid him killa|`|ShhSpZjJaa	PSSSHHH LEAVE THAT ASSSSSSS|`|qplKpji5aa	He's probably cheating on you. Not trying to be a ***** myself, but it doesn't sound good. If he thinks they are bitches why is he still friends with them.....Get it?|`|nJ4NFyvCaa	You've been with him over a year and he's got all these lady friends huh? How much common sense do you have? P.S.-a retard Liz? No, but for future reference, do refer to the old saying if it walks and talks like a duck, it must be.........get my drift? And ALWAYS trust what you feel is REALLY going on. Reason being, people will tell you want you want to hear 90 percent of the time. And it's B.S. You think they want to be found out? Listen to those, and you'll be all right.|`|avpv7u8saa	Your bf is a playa|`|QBPVdjAPaa	He is playing you, he does not want you to meet them and then be jealous of them assuming they are that great.|`|wk4GoCegaa	Why would they hate you if all they know about you is what he's told them?
KOYZfaDkaa	It sounds like she wants you to feel included and to get to know you better. I say if you have the time to go with her to places then go (you don't have an obligation to go all the time though), she invited you- it's not like you're inviting yourself. Go and enjoy!|`|sGP6s7uraa	When it comes to her dress, ANYBODY goes for a trial session.  When if comes to BM dresses, then yeah, that's the time to step down and say it isn't your place to decide and offer that the BM's go.  Go to her dress trial.  It'll be fun!|`|b9Hl0ITnaa	I am sure that her BM will be there also.  I think you should accept this invitation.  She is not asking you to do any wedding planning, she is only asking for you to tag along for the wedding dress shopping.  I think it would be an insult to him and his family if you declined.  Now, if there is bad vibes between you then I understand and so would she, but if you get along fine I think you should accept.  This is shopping for her dress, not the maids dresses.  I am sure she invited her maids, YOUR mom, her mom and so on.  In a good faith attempt with the family I would accept and if it gets too long, just say I have to run, I did not realize how long it takes and good luck.  But at least suck it up for a couple of hours.  It would be insulting not to.  Plus many women feel this is an honor, to help the bride pick out the dress.  MY SIL lives in another state, but I know she would have loved to have gone with me to pick out my dress.|`|Y8fHrVCHaa	well you could go to try on dresses with her because its lots of funn to go and check them out with your friends. I think that you could tell her that you will help her with things that she my need to get together (favor,made items, or guest bags) but that you think it would be better if the moh helped with the planning and that the moh should deff want to do that. She should understand that you just arent into the planning thing.|`|1gDYrbTOaa	I don't see why not go with her...of course if you have time to do so. After all she will be your sister. Do you get along with her? if not I understand. Also I have a feeling that you might be feeling bitter a tiny tiny bit about her not choosing you as a bridesmaid although you say it's fine. If that's the case i'm sorry... But i wonder why she doesn't ask her bridesmaid to do the planning together? where is she?? is she out of town or so??? Have you asked her why she doesn't help her?
ZkuYBUByaa	THe only person that can answer this question is U.  We all make mistakes and sometimes some of us get caught and end up in jail.  I wouldn't rush anything, I would let him get out and see where his mind is.  Like, is he focused on bettering himself, or is he doing the same thing that brought him to jail?  My best friend is in jail, we dated when we were teenagers, I write to him all the time.  On paper it sounds like he changed his life around, but actions speak louder then words.  So, when he gets out we shall see if he CHANGED.  Good Luck!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Whether they have changed or not jail will have changed them. Too many reasons to stay away. Finding work is a big one.|`|U5IigAByaa	that totally depends on what they went inside for!  any violence then its a definite no no.|`|PMtqTW6qaa	keep the bail bond numbers handy don't buy anything together you should be just fine.|`|AA11335702	You need to get to know each other all over again. Cause trust me that is not the same person you knew b4. Try a little dating first and see where his head is at. Please don't rush into nothing that you might regret in the long run.|`|lzooHi0Baa	We all deserve a second chance if we truly change for the better and become honest and decent.  You will need to test the water before jumping in.   Be friends for as long as it takes to convince you he has changed and proves it.   I don't think this is the time to even think of marriage, regardless.   A couple of months will show the true colors, don't rush.   You call the shots and sit back and watch.|`|X7Zk82Rsaa	If he his providing and can offer you something love ain't gonna pay the bills or feed your future children. If he has a record it's gonna be hard for him to find a job most of these men who get out of jail don't get a job their only job is WOMANIZING they can't get anything on their own apartment for example so they always have to DEPEND on someone if they have a felony be smart he may love u but he's gonna cheat believe that|`|uuMCGT9taa	its different for each person.    my bf went to jail b4 we dated and i plan on marrying him    he went to jail 1 while we where together for like 4 days for a warrant.    it was hard as long as they dont keep putting you threw the hassle there worth it. i told my man id only do that once and that was it !|`|UaSb84BOaa	First, what is 'recent'? Second, what were they in there for? Was that their first time? Did you know them before they went into jail or meet while they were in there?   I can't be suspect about everyone who was in jail as my fiance was in for 6 years, basically for being stupid. He realizes what he missed while he was in and is not planning on going back.   Answer those questions and then decide.|`|satoCRC6aa	proceed with caution,  why in jail and is the behavior continuing?  do you want to go to jail too just by hanging around that person..|`|AXbdNdPzaa	depends on why he went to jail!|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Probably not. They'd need to do a lot of proving to me that they changed and I wouldn't marry them until they stayed clean for a couple of years-one month or something proves nothing.|`|Y4B5CYKFaa	give him some time. let him be around normal people for a while like a year. if he can stabilize his life then sure, but don't rush.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	That depends the reason this person got locked up in the first place.  As long as he is good in the heart and you are madly in love with him, then maybe.  But I would wait until his life is back on track (steady job, good behavior, etc) before marring him.|`|M4X3HOV5aa	No cause they are going to end up going back. You should try to find a free man.|`|Bc4udMhUaa	No, I can honestly say I would not marry someone who has gone to jail|`|HRIbmp67aa	HELL NO!    Been there before.  Too much stress.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Corrections are to help correct people when they make a mistake.  I know some very nice people that have made some profound changes as a result of corrections.    Each person should be judged by the actions and deeds that they make today.  Of course, there is no guarantees in life as the only perfect human to have walked on this earth to my limited knowledge was a man named Jesus.|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Is his last gf dead or alive. That would be the person to ask|`|LUhh9bSWaa	Yeah that's a great idea.  Don't forget to get back to us on that one.|`|dgRTkccBaa	I guess it would depend why he was in jail.  Probably not, though, especially if it was something that he was liable to do again.
ugvgt6rMaa	I'm sorry but if he liked you than he would spend time with you and when ever he wanted to spend some time with his friends than he would bring you along with him. You should leave him and find yourself another boyfriend who treats you way better.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	No, a man who loves a woman or likes one a lot will ignore his friends to spend time.
XgejRqWsaa	no it's fine.|`|eoDWzUNxaa	Nope. Age is just a number what matters most is that they care about each other or are at least in a healthy relationship.      :)
zdWJUWk8aa	When I was younger ( and "in love".. long story) my boyfriend at the time gave me a promise ring to do basically what you are suggesting here, until we could get a little older and he could afford an engagement ring. It was a small diamond, and I wore it on my ring finger where the engagement ring would go, just to symbolize even more what it was, otherwise it just seemed like any other ring to me and to other people around me. I would suggest the same for you. Have her where it on the same finger so that people understand what it means, and its like the smaller version of what is to come. I used to get excited when I would look at it, just thinking about everything that would lye ahead. :) Good luck!|`|93a3cd690b6ab97234e9c87b1716e25baa	My boyfriend (at the time) gave me a promise ring before we went to college together. It was a clear symbol that I was taken and was there on my left ring finger holding the spot for my engagement ring. So I would definitely wear the "betrothal" ring on the same finger as the engagement ring would go on. :)|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	In case you didn't know, an engagement used to be called a betrothal. So you are planning to give her two engagement rings? Most guys do good to afford one and a wedding ring in addition.
YNlA7Yqdaa	algunas mujeres dicen que no importa el tama?o, sino que como lo uses.<br>  de igual manera, si se fue con otro esa no es excusa. Posiblemente no tenía una excusa y utilizó ese pretexto....<br>  eso es lo más probable.<br>  porque no creo que ella sea tan superficial como para que le importe eso solamente, y no valore tu calidad de ser humano y otras cualidades que de seguro tendrás. Si ella no valora lo demás, no te merece, y tranquilo que la venganza no es buena, al final destruye el alma, y ten esperanzas, que lo más seguro es que llegue una nueva mujer a tu vida que de verdad te valore y aprecie.|`|01vFxLNjaa	es importante<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chistesmuyfuertes.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://chistesmuyfuertes.blogspot.com</a>|`|ujSQWPlyaa	mira me parece que estas hablando de alguien muy superficial que no te amaba, mejor que salio de tu vida, por ahora te va a doler pero poco a poco se te va a ir no lo conviertas en venganza esa mala mujer no vale la pena restale importancia|`|544872447274c5c6b945b24f05ad3a88aa	Vamos que los hombres no saben leer entre líneas?. Si te dijo eso es que está enojada contigo,ó está harta de vos, entonces qué es lo que más les molesta a los hombres, que le digan que no la tienen grande, dijo eso para que te fueras y no la molestaras más.<br>  Ahora, si vive con otro hombre, obviamente ya no te eligió a vos en primer lugar, entonces lo del tama?o es sólo una excusa.  Otro tema es que ustedes no congenien en la cama, eso pasa, entonces por más enamorado que se esté, si no funcionan bien entonces no son el uno para el otro. <br>  El tama?o sí es importante, pero tenés que ser un anormal para no poder concretar la relación.<br>  Olvidate de la venganza, ya no le des más importancia y buscate una que te quiera tal como sos.|`|7Khj9uzOaa	CLARO QUE NO CUANDO SE AMA SINCERAMENTE  NO TE INTERESA EL TAMA?O SOLO TE IMPORTA LA PERSONA Y NO TE INTERESA SI TE PUEDE DAR COSAS MATERIALES O NO ESAS COSAS SON SUPERFICIALES, YO CREO QUE ELLA SOLO TE UTILIZO A SU CONVENIENCIA, PERO NO LE DESES NADA MALO PERDONALA LA VENGANZA NO ES BUENA NI TE DA SATISFACCION MANDALE BENDICIONES Y SE FELIZ TODO EN ESTA VIDA SE PAGA  EXISTE UN DIOS Y TU TRATA DE SER FELIZ SUERTE BYE PIENSA POSITIVO|`|8XjFxIqeaa	simplemente fue la respuesta estúpida de una persona que no le interesa nada de la vida... o es que acaso pensabas que te iba a ser fiel a vos, cuando le está metiendo los cuernos a alguien que seguramente le prometió amor eterno???<br>  <br>  Simplemente las mujeres son menos superficilaes que los hombre a la hora de elegir a alguien. Es en la mayoría de los casos, pero tranquilo, amigo... <br>  <br>  Si te cortó con excusa de que tu miembro viril no la satisface, lo más seguro es que sea ninfómana, o simplemente le gusta jugar ocn los hombres....<br>  <br>  Ya vas a encontrar a una mujer para vos... sólo hay que espera, y el tiempo te ayudará a olvidar a ese adefesio que se hace llamar mujer.<br>  <br>  Mucha suerte!|`|a5ProYJkaa	Entonces esta mal tu novia, no vale la pena, te recomiendo que la mandes al diablo, ella es una golosa que solo se fija en el dinero y en el tama?o del pene, asi que de echo te esta haciendo un favor al no estar contigo puesto que no vale la pena, buscate una chica que si valga la pena te aseguro que hay muchas.|`|40tRsbYRaa	uuuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy...... dejameee decirteee que tu noviesitaaaaaaaaaaaaa lamentablemente es una golfaaa....ese tipo de mujeresssss que se fijan en el tama?o del penee y esooo son unas juguetonasss que solo les importaaa el sexoo y pasarrr una placenteraa nocheee....desechalaa, olvidalaaaa y gracias a dios te distes cuentaaa que eraaa una juguetona....y otra cosa por esaaa malaa expirienciaa que te pasoooo....no odiess ni la paguesss con el resto de las mujeresss somosssssssssssss diferentesssss...cada una tiene lo suyoooo.....y no le agarres odioooo...es solo unaaa golfa heridaaaaaa.......lo unico que le importaba era tu plataaaa....buscatee otraaa mujerr que te valoreeee y no por tu peneee porqueee importaaa como se muevaa no el tama?oooo okkkk....|`|HM4OliFFaa	pues eso de pende de los gustos que tengan ellas<br>  pero la mayoria de las mujeres no lo toman mucho en cuenta<br>  otra no les gusta pues les lastima<br>  y creme que esa mujer no vale la pena pues para ella vale mas un trozo de carne que todo el amor que decia tenerte<br>  no te mortifiques <br>  un pene no es todo en una relacion<br>  y el dia que encuentres una chica que te valore por lo que res y como eres y no por el tama?o de tu miembro ella sera la indicada<br>  <br>  se lo que tedigo<br>  por algo todos somos diferentes<br>  yo no lo tengo muy grande pero hay muchas formas de hacer gozar a una mujer<br>  lee libros<br>  de sexualidad<br>  a mi me sirvieron mucho|`|MJR2FLcyaa	NO TE PREOCUPES, tampoco te vengues, no guardes rencor y trata de seguir tu vida, por lo que percibo en ti creo que kereces algo mejor que esa chica, quiza ella priorice la satisfacion sexual a traves de un miembro grande y no la culpo, a mi la mayoria de chicas que e tenido me persiguen por el tama?o de mi miembro pero no les doy mucha importancia pues buesco dos aspectos principales en una mujer:  placer sexual......y nobleza interna.....raras tienen las dos juntas.|`|NQV4LUtaaa	La persona que te ame, te va a amar tal y como lo tengas, ademas no importa lo "largo y  lo grueso si no lo que dure tieso", el amor es algo mas que sexo.

Por otro lado una mujer que solo busca el tama?o de un pene, es por que no esta bien de la cabeza y seguramente tendría que buscar trabajo un pelis de porno, si una mujer no sabe valorar lo que es un hombre por su esencia, por lo romántico, comprensivo, mira compadre dejala ir poque ella no es para tu esposa ni madre para tus hijos.|`|pQERhTJoaa	no  lo tomes enserio hay  muchas mujeres que prefieren lo normal  que lo anormal  yo pienso que  lo mejor siempre viene en frascos  peque?o  te amo

VAawBNwxaa	Você tem raz?o no que diz....amigo é aquele verdadeiro....que esta ali para qualquer coisa e qualquer situa??o.....e colega s?o os que fazemos ate mesmo olho a olho e que s?o falsos e que nunca podemos contar....no virtual embora n?o tenha olho no olho,tambem temos amigos.....aqueles que est?o aqui para te dar conforto, palavras de carinho, uma for?a quando prwecisa.....sendo assim....sou real qdo digo que existe amigos aqui sim......e se você tiver contato comigo....mesmo que virtual, vai poder acreditar que existem realmente amigos aqui.....agora como vc diz olhos nos olhos, ent?o posso dizer que vc é um gato....já que te vi na foto.....beijus meu lindo e nem encana com isso....fa?a amizades aqui.....e as boas vc guarda e as ruins deleta.....ok beij?o e prazer em te-lo na minha lista de amigos.......e é um prazer te conhecer mesmo que virtuaal................|`|035e2034895eb48548468ab04585acdbaa	Acho que amizade virtual é uma coisa e amizade é outra... O fato de ser virtual n?o deixa de ter o seu valor, mas as limita??es s?o bem maiores... <br>  <br>  Quem se enfia numa amizade virtual achando que é a mesma coisa que uma amizade onde existe a convivência e todas as etapas de uma amizade real tem todas as chances de se dar mal... Tem que saber separar!<br>  <br>  Infelizmente, ou felizmente, mo mundo virtual as pessoas mostram apenas aquilo que querem mostrar... Facilmente se fica encantado com os amigos virtuais, mas talvez se houvesse uma convivência real o encantamento n?o seria t?o grande assim ou nem houvesse.<br>  <br>  Abra?os...|`|04GNyFxwaa	Concordo com vc em certos pontos, mas creio q há possibilidade de convivências digamos assim, virtuais.|`|60SLet21aa	Realmente, mas temos que saber separar o real do virtual, embora tenham exce??es em que "amigos virtuais" podem virar "amigos reais". Certamente, muitas pessoas criam nomes, personalidades, identidades diferentes  do que realmente s?o,  se formos pensar na sinceridade ou verdade, cada pessoa pode inventar qualquer coisa... AMIGOS DE VERDADE é melhor conhecer na vida real ter aquele contato, poder conversar e ver o rosto da outra pessoa, sua sinceridade, respeito, companheirismo...<br>  é claro que existem pessoas que tem necessidade de ter amigos virtuais, porque talvez pensem ser mais fácil. Em rela??o ao YR, pode ser criada uma rela??o de afinidade, com idéias ou gostos parecidos, trocando informa??es por e-mails...  poderia ser considerado como "Colega do YR".|`|LL4hPustaa	rapaz, na net você faz colegas e companheiros...já tive muitos amigos virtuais que me comuniquei desde pequeno e quando os conhe?i pessoalmente foi totalmente diferente do que o que eu esperava.

abcsgRG3aa	well first off, you managed to tell us.<br>  <br>  why don't you try telling your dad that you've got a lot of stuff on your mind and need some help sorting it out? that would help you get closer to him since he'd understand your more. plus you'll be able to trust him and who says your dad can't be one of your best friends? <br>  i don't really worry about having close friends or real friends or people to trust. eventually people will come along that you know you can trust, and you'll be just fine. it's probably just a part of the fact that you're so young--a lot of the people your age are scared at growing up but won't admit it, so since they can't tell anyone, they really aren't adequate at being told important things like you've got here. just hang in there and you'll find that the important people will start to show up and will stay around for a long time.<br>  what kind of scary thoughts? if you mean like "what would happen if i got in a car crash" kind of scary, then add that to the things to talk to your dad about. parents really know their kids better than you'd think, and he can help comfort you and get you feeling better. <br>  what kinds of things have you been seeing? again, talking to your dad is a great help. i mean, he's your dad after all, so it's not like he'll say "you're weird, we aren't friends anymore." he's quite likely to say "what can i do to help?"<br>  feeling lonely is probably due to the feeling that you have no real friends you can trust. first off, don't worry what people think of you and you will find yourself much happier, which helps take care of that lonely feeling. and again, talk to your dad, because then you'll have someone who's there for you that can understand you. and if someone is there, then you aren't alone, are you? :)<br>  heck who doesn't want to be a kid again? :-D i'm 19 and i still wish i could run around playing games all day and have really easy homework from middle school and not have any responsibility. i get a little taste of being a kid every now and again because i have young nieces and nephews. if you have younger cousins or siblings, then just hang around with them a bit more if you can. playing a simple game like "go fish" with a 6 year old is the best medicine i've ever found to cure that feeling. :) and if you wanna bake with your mom again, then do it! find a time, like a weekend, when you two are both home and don't have any urgent work or homework to do, and say "hey mom can we bake some cookies or something?" i have yet to find a mother that doesn't want to bake with her daughter. got any birthdays coming up soon? perfect excuse to bake a cake! and frosting it is the best part--it's fun, and you can snag some to eat while you're doing it! :-P<br>  how do you mean abusive? like physical or verbal? if you are still having trouble coping with the fact that you did it, then talk to them about it. talk to them about how you're feeling about it and how they feel about it. best way to get over something is to get it out in the open. and at 14, who doesn't hurt a sibling every so often? my sister is 3 years older than me and we'd have relatively common physical fights from the time i was about 8 to when i was about 18. i used to get bruises all the time. i honestly wouldn't worry about it too much, you'll grow out of it eventually. in my case, my sister knows exactly what to do to get me in a temper and start a fight. see if you can figure out what your brother does to trigger it, so you know when you walk away or avoid it. <br>  where you should be spiritually is a question that really only you can answer. i would suggest thinking about what you already know about your religion, and trying to learn more about it. if you find that your religion doesn't answer your questions, then start learning about other religions and see if you can have your questions answered. i'd recommend staying jewish for now, but when you're grown up and on your own, if you find that another religion really suits you better, you could probably convert. i can't really help you any more than that since i'm orthodox, which is rather different.<br>  <br>  and definitely DON'T lose weight! at 105 i can imagine you are already very skinny and you definitely don't need to lose any weight. i tell you what, i've got to lose a little weight for my sister's wedding, so i'll lose the weight for you! :-D<br>  <br>  honestly i'd say sit and think these things over for a little while and then go talk to your dad. keep a journal of your thoughts, every day. at the end of the week, look over it and see if your thoughts have changed any and how. address whatever issues you want, none are off limits. if you get sad, put on some jumpy dance music and dance around your room with the door shut. it's absolutely my favorite therapy for sadness! and if that doesn't do it, then sometimes putting your ipod on shuffle will do the trick and play just the right music for your mood. if you find that after maybe a month or so you are still having a lot of trouble with these thoughts and talking to your parents (or just your dad or whoever) isn't helping, then maybe you do need to talk to someone else who's not so close with you. try a teacher you are close with or your school counselor. <br>  <br>  and i'm willing to help you out if you need someone else to talk to (even though technically i am a stranger). send an email if you need to. good luck sweetie! <3|`|2545e155e303c5adba6838fc91624d3caa	hey, listen i can understand what you are going through, and no i know you dont need to see a psychologist. maybe it would help to talk to a teacher you trust at school, like a guidence person. not saying you have to, but it may help =] and remember, dont let other make you think what they want to. if they say grow up, dont listen, life can be hard, just dont be too hard on your self. Ive been upset lately, but its just stress... i think. anyways....<br>  <br>  -i want to be closer to my dad<br>  well... why cant you?  if there isnt a good reason then try. do stuff you guys both like, or what he likes, then what you both like to do. spend time with people you love. really. and get to know any family member that is sick, because i lost my dad whne i was 2 and wish ididnt, i didnt get a chance to see who he actually was, i wish i could see him for a weekend just to see.. but i cant. =/ thats one of the things ive been upset about too.. and because one of my friends keep saying htey hate their dad and wish they werent around, which fries me up.<br>  <br>  -i dont have any friends that i can trust<br>  hmm that can be tough.  =[ im really sorry. taht may be me soon. parents want to move, and i wont know anyone. i guess you will have to be more independent and gain friends and see who u can really trust. just dont change to hang with them. and please please please dont do drugs or smoke. if my dad didnt smoke, he could of lived.<br>  <br>  -real friends.. same thing as above. maybe you could email me and tell me why u dont have anyone.<br>  <br>  -scary thoughts- hmm waht are they...? ive been having some messed up ones too... =/<br>  <br>  -seeing things- omg, me too. all the time, expecailly when im alone. i really hate it. and i hear things.... and i SKETCH and want to like run away and go lock myself in a car to be safe. very freaky things..... just try to ignore it. it can be hard. VERY hard, but just try harddddd. you can do it. make sure to be getting plenty of sleep as well.<br>  <br>  -lonely. me too. =/ i used to have lots of close friends. now i have just one close friend and one boyfriend, but im still thankful for that, because some people odnt have anything. u may think you dont have anyone. but you do ;)<br>  <br>  -kid, yeah i wish i could be too. people say im so unmature cause i have hyper streaks..( i think its ADD or ADHD but mom doesnt want me on anything) and that gets me mad. so i wish that i could have fun and run around.<br>  <br>  -abusive thing - AHH!! me too! with my little brother as well.. well just try to do stuff with him that he likes. and the whole time remember. stay friendly. dont get upset. then after a while it will click in untill you have it done. u may have anger issues, but if you do its ok. just try to find other ways to deal with stress... <br>  <br>  -sprit. sorry cant help you at all with that<br>  <br>  -weight... me 2, wow we are a lot alike. im 5'4'' i think im now 5'5''ish lol but im 120-135 depends on day.... :P and i wanna be 115... but i found if u get newer bigger clothes you feel more comfuturble, but dont go over bored... i alwas wear my sweater and now i feel like i can never take it off..<br>  <br>  <br>  well i hope i helped you. im passing out here. last night i had 6 hours of sleep... usually its 5 though for school but ive been running all around today.. so yeah just please write back to me at gmichelle10@yahoo.com or moony_569@yahoo.com its me both ways. lol<br>  <br>  ok take care.. <3 i can be here for you :) i love to help people. and i would be interested in helping you :D|`|18WVOMcHaa	lucky!

However, there is also going too far...playing hard to get constantly, taking days to return calls...a lot of the time it will either a) piss the person off or b) be obvious that you are only doing it to play hard to get.<br>  <br>  I sometimes like going for what i cant have and like the challenge...but then some guys take it too far and i end up just worrying that they dont like me.<br>  <br>  So i think the best aim is to keep a bit of you for yourself, dong give it your all and dont be too clingy..but dont play too hard to get...it will just send the wrong message and will end up in an on-going game playing relationship...not good.|`|qrRsDqmnaa	It's all about the person to me.  If they're what I want, I'll work with the rest of it, either way -- AS LONG AS THEY  AREN'T PLAYING GAMES.  Then, forget it, I know they're not for me.

mhS48EBqaa	You could ask him to help you with some of your homework or on something that you dont get or find out what he likes to do and you like to do and start a conversation on it and usually those conversations turn into something where you talk to him longer than you expected! That's what I would do!<br>  <br>  <br>  I really hope this helped,<br>  Allie<3|`|K4q4dByraa	Since you don't really talk, you should see if any of your friends talk to him, that way they could ask him to hang out: it'd be easier for them since they don't "like" him. Or if you talk to his friends then ask them to come to a movie with you and your friends and to bring him. Or if you want to do this on your own- go on myspace!!! it always works. and add him as a friend,, then start talking to him and say "we should hang out some time" and see what he says...then ask for his number, by the way i think guys would love it if a girl asked for their number  (unless she's just wierd and you don't seem wierd) well good luck.....if he likes you it'll work great : )
ChokfzRFaa	IM IN THE SAME SITUATION
LjCpk4rHaa	No I don't think it would be weird.  Isn't that like the cliche teen love story?  (Boy and girl who used to be best friends suddenly realize they're destined to be more than friends...etc...)  <br>  <br>  However, if this boy IS as big a flirt as you say, and he flirts even with your best friend who has a boyfriend, I would say watch out for that.
t0KAgdqpaa	Sounds like you like him more than your willing to admit. <br>  Jealously will end you anyway, maybe try a relationship. At this point, what do you have to lose?|`|smYt2qcdaa	Its not that easy.. since you got used to him.. its a habbit.<br>  you should find things to keep you occupied... it should do the trick to forget him.|`|Be0CtbMzaa	Wait until he starts dating a girl and starts flaunting her around you.|`|MJqmOEZVaa	ok if you dont want to be with just one guy then why do you care if he is saying he is single if you care soo much go out with him because if it is not offical then he can say he is single|`|XyXPCZMAaa	That sounds like a complex, annoying feeling but I have to remind you that you BOTH know what kind of relationship you have and unless the two of you talk about making it exclusive, you're in no position to complain.

Pode significar afei??o, compaix?o, misericórdia, ou ainda, inclina??o, atra??o, apetite, paix?o, querer bem, satisfa??o, conquista, desejo, libido, etc. O conceito mais popular de amor envolve, de modo geral, a forma??o de um vínculo emocional com alguém, ou com algum objeto que seja capaz de receber este comportamento amoroso e alimentar as estimula??es sensoriais e psicológicas necessárias para a sua manuten??o e motiva??o.<br>  <br>  Fala-se do amor das mais diversas formas: amor físico, amor plat?nico, amor materno, amor a Deus, amor à vida. é o tipo de amor que tem rela??o com o caráter da própria pessoa e a motiva a amar (no sentido de querer bem e agir em prol).<br>  <br>  As muitas dificuldades que essa diversidade de termos oferece, em conjunto à suposta unidade de significado, ocorrem n?o só nos idiomas modernos, mas também no grego e no latim. O grego possui outras palavras para amor, cada qual denotando um sentido específico. No latim encontramos amor, dilectio, charitas, bem como Eros, quando se refere ao amor personificado numa deidade.<br>  <br>  Amar também tem o sentido de gostar muito, sendo assim possível amar qualquer ser vivo ou objeto.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pode ser assim o amor?=D|`|hGdG7Ht7aa	pra mim é cumplicidade, lealdade , carinho pela pessoa amada. e estar sempre junto dela mesmo nos momentos mais dificieis.|`|jZKomZKraa	Amor é um sentimento magno, quem ama desenvolve a capacidade de escultar, de abdicar, de se doar, ou seja, se torma um ser humano melhor.|`|k5VOFJeYaa	Amor verdadeiro procede de Deus, é nele inspirado, faz apenas bem...<br>  <br>  e se encontra excepcionalmente definido na bíblia:<br>  <br>  1 Co 13<br>  <br>  1 AINDA que eu falasse as línguas dos homens e dos anjos, e n?o tivesse amor, seria como o metal que soa ou como o sino que tine. <br>  2 E ainda que tivesse o dom de profecia, e conhecesse todos os mistérios e toda a ciência, e ainda que tivesse toda a fé, de maneira tal que transportasse os montes, e n?o tivesse amor, nada seria. <br>  3 E ainda que distribuísse toda a minha fortuna para sustento dos pobres, e ainda que entregasse o meu corpo para ser queimado, e n?o tivesse amor, nada disso me aproveitaria. <br>  4 O amor é sofredor, é benigno; o amor n?o é invejoso; o amor n?o trata com leviandade, n?o se ensoberbece. <br>  5 N?o se porta com indecência, n?o busca os seus interesses, n?o se irrita, n?o suspeita mal; <br>  6 N?o folga com a injusti?a, mas folga com a verdade; <br>  7 Tudo sofre, tudo crê, tudo espera, tudo suporta. <br>  8 O amor nunca falha; mas havendo profecias, ser?o aniquiladas; havendo línguas, cessar?o; havendo ciência, desaparecerá; <br>  9 Porque, em parte, conhecemos, e em parte profetizamos; <br>  10 Mas, quando vier o que é perfeito, ent?o o que o é em parte será aniquilado. <br>  11 Quando eu era menino, falava como menino, sentia como menino, discorria como menino, mas, logo que cheguei a ser homem, acabei com as coisas de menino. <br>  12 Porque agora vemos por espelho em enigma, mas ent?o veremos face a face; agora conhe?o em parte, mas ent?o conhecerei como também sou conhecido. <br>  13 Agora, pois, permanecem a fé, a esperan?a e o amor, estes três, mas o maior destes é o amor.|`|pYba7g1oaa	Amor é diferente para todo o ser humano, e existem muitos tipos de amor, fraternal, maternal, etc...

fF5Zzd9laa	Rocha,excelente pergunta, meu irm?ozinho,pelo visto pouquíssimas pessoas entenderam a sua pergunta,e por isso ficam dando pedrada,n?o é culpa das mesmas,mas sim culpa da situa??o atual do mundo "moderno". Eu sei que você n?o excluiu os homens em sua pergunta,sei que você estava só tentando preservar a imagem das mo?as de hoje,pois enganam se,pois acham que ser moderna é se entregar sem a menor resistência a um dom Huam qualquer só porque ser virgem é "preconceito",ser?o deixadas pra titia,mas saiba meu amigo que estes bons principios nem sempre ser?o compreendidos nesta gera??o,pois a internet,a mídia falada e escrita,as músicas,cinemas etc,contribuem e muito para a degenera??o do real sentido da existência humana,n?o quero dizer que o sexo deve só ser feito para se ter filhos,mas o sexo é um sinal de amor,por isso o termo deve sempre ser " fazer amor" mas infelismente transar é mais importante que fazer amor,o sexo foi nos concedido por um Deus amoroso para ser usado como express?o de amor a outrem,e n?o para ser comercializado ou oferecido a bel prazer,simplesmente porque "eu tenho vontade" . Fomos colocados neste mundo para termos dominio sobre nós mesmos,e isso significa dominar nossa mente e corpo,o homem que perde o domínio de si mesmo,jamais se encontrará  nesta vida ou provavelmente em outra. Um homem deve se apegar a sua esposa e somente a ela,e do mesmo modo a esposa a seu marido e naturalmente dentro dos la?os sagrados do matrim?nio fazer sim bastante amor,mas um amor verdadeiro e n?o comercial ou banal,sem nenhum sentido. Pergunto aos amigos favoráveis ao sexo livre,porque existem tantas doen?as sexualmente transmissíveis ? porque existe a AIDS ? Qual foi a causa da destrui??o de sodoma e gomorra ? <br>  O homem foi criado a imagem e semelhan?a de Deus,imagem e semelhan?a significa que parecemos Deuses,será que nosso Deus  é libertino ?|`|0b88c5eee56a875fa7d349cc9e0780aaaa	Li todas as respostas,concordo com muitos aqui:<br>  <br>  Gisela T,Menino do Rio,Amigo Oculto,Malu,Andréa vlv,Caio Pires,Piper Arrojada,Estrela Maria Solitária,Passageiro do Mundo,Isa...........uau!!! depois dessa só posso deizer que vc parou num tempo lá atrás,mas muito atrás mesmo.<br>  <br>  é necessário acompanhar a evolu??o e n?o estagnar.<br>  <br>  Boa noite.|`|58373dbdebc55449ad466879a463debdaa	Acho que n?o tem nada de mais, pois o mundo evoluiu e está comprovado que o sexo faz bem para a saúde.<br>  Só é preciso se precaver tomando anticoncepcionais e usando camisinha.<br>  "No passado" o pensamento é igual ao de hoje, ou seja: O homem pode comer todas as mulheres, e porque a mulher tambem n?o pode dar pra quem quizer?<br>  Basta se prevenir, como eu falei.<br>  Isso tudo, eu falei para minha filha, quando ela tinha 14 anos, hoje ela está com 19 e provavelmente transa com o namorado, mas toma todos os cuidados, porque eu ensinei !!!!!!!!!|`|620520a81b0c8c9809178da5604646d6aa	Sou favorável ao sexo antes do casamento é uma forma de saber o que espera o casal as vezes o homem é um jumento e o casamento n?o dará certo a menos que a mulher seja uma égua ,também pode acontecer de a mulher ser uma cacimba,  assim sendo com um homem normal também n?o dura muito tempo o  casamento, além disso tem o problema visual algumas genitálias n?o s?o bonitas de se ver, tudo tem sua relevancia, por isso é preciso que haja intimidades antes do casamento (abra?os|`|6hYJIFCraa	e se sua namorada nao abrisse as pernas pra vc?<br>  <br>  vc iria dizer aqui:  "nossa o que eu fa?o?"<br>  <br>  po.. se vc come todo mundo pq ela nao pode tambem?|`|9Dgu33mCaa	ótima resposta Gisela, assino embaixo...

Girls like honesty, and if the girl made the first move, you're obviously in the driver's seat.  Good for you, and go out there and make me proud!|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	If you like her, and your interested you should go for it!!<br>  you can get to know her better...|`|4MZGbNsfaa	If you like her and want her as a girlfriend, go for it.

t0KAgdqpaa	As odd as this sounds its a sort of emotional cheating. Trust me, you have the perfect girl right now. You are going to destroy something perfect if you fall for this "what-if" woman. Do you really want to hurt your gf? Lose contact with this woman. Its the best bet. <br>  <br>  <br>  "Don't leave the one you love for the one you like because the one you like will leave you for the one they love."<br>  [great quote think before you do something rash]
t0KAgdqpaa	If you used to talk to her, then make a point to pass by her between classes just to say hi. [Don't make it obvious your doing this: if she finds out on her own she'll be impressed]. After a couple "hellos" proceed to saying "hey its been a while since we hung out, we should get a ____ after class today and catch up!" Then its out in the open you want to hang out, but its not quite asking her on a date.  Or try inviting her to a group movie thing using the same idea. "to catch up"|`|KBzc9SUeaa	Ask her out for coffee. Just go for it son! The worst she can say is "No." and if says something worse than just no, then she's not worth it. :)|`|WhbMFSDkaa	Talk to her when you see her. Not a long *** talk, i'm talking small talk. It accumulates. You know? Get her fimiliar with you again, out of sight out of mind. Eventually she will want to talk to you more. Be confident, be yourself, be charming. It should work out, let's hope.|`|d5dT50Syaa	Make eye contact with her at any change and as you used to speak to her before why not say hello and ask her how she has been! this will get a conversation flowing|`|lQmTA1Lsaa	friend , go n talk her otherwise she will forget u.<br>  keep in tough her.|`|pv2Ig8qDaa	just talk to her regularly <br>  share her feelings everything try to be her best friend <br>  then ask some day that are you her good friend or best friend in a joke to rate you for this|`|biUmHwmSaa	too bad i guess.|`|d0737ef8f11da887c8ae5b3067f7ff97aa	Just ask her number then
odIXsfaUaa	well that is different in mostly every single family. I mean sure moms get the rep. for being the "cool, calm, and collected" baking apple pies, i love my kids soooo much blahblah crap and Dads are usually the more solitary kind who read the newspaper in an armchair with their pipe or w/e, but honestly with adult-types running around trying to out-rich all of their neighbors these days i truley don't know who my better parent is since I don't see either of my parents too often..|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	my mom is the best to me!!!<br>  shes actually like my mom and dad<br>  she can play both roles<br>  shes capable of doing anything<br>  i love her sooo much ?<br>  she has her temper<br>  but doesnt every parent do?? lol ..well yeah
ZhFtSU1Laa	Does he like you? That's one of the complicated questions, I've answered over and over again. There are a few signs.<br>     <br>  1. He may be courteous but not curious.  Some men may be well-mannered and show this by remembering your name, making eye contact, engaging in small talk, being an attentive listener, and asking questions with apparent sincere interest.  But this may only be an indicator of courtesy, emotional maturity, or good human relations skills.  While all these positive things are helpful in creating a friendly atmosphere, it would be unwise for you to jump to the conclusion that the man is actually interested in a romantic way.  It may simply be a case of a more refined, civilized man acting in a courteous manner towards you as a person. <br>     2. He may be curious, but not actually be interested or even like you.  Sometimes you will run across a man who expresses a lot of curiosity in the way he asks questions, gives you his full attention, and keeps his eyes riveted on you.  But these behaviors don't automatically mean that the man is interested in dating you or that he has developed any feelings of affection towards you.  He may just find you to be interesting looking and/or he may be already involved with another woman and this is his one seemingly harmless way of enjoying the variety of other women in a detached, non-threatening way.<br>     3. He may like you some, but not enough to risk the pressure of rejection.   A man may have positive feelings for you, but those feelings aren't strong enough or clear enough at this point to make the effort of pursuing you aggressively.  It could be that the circumstances of his life make it much easier and less painful to just let this romantic opportunity pass.  Perhaps he feels the competition for you is too stiff, that you're already involved with another man, or that you don't think very highly of him.  In any case, the guy figures that it's just not worth the hassle to pursue you and feel the pressure of a possible rejection.  On the other hand, if a man starts asking around with your mutual acquaintances about you, then that may be his way of gathering all the facts before making his big calculated move towards asking you out.<br>     4. He may like you enough to overcome his fears and ask you out on a date.  If a man actually asks you out for a date, then that confirms his initial interest and positive feelings in the clearest way.  If he backs that up by making a real effort in planning the date, spending money, treating you with respect, and showing you a good time, then you may be well on your way to being asked out again.  You can help your cause towards continuing this dating relationship by:  expressing gratitude, allowing the man to get comfortable, enjoying yourself on the date, and engaging in lively conversation that leaves a pleasant imprint on the man's heart and mind.<br>     5. He likes you enough to want a relationship with you.  A man could actually like you, ask you out on a few dates, and still end up giving up the pursuit.  If his feelings of affection or desire aren't strong enough or don't come quickly enough, he may fade away from you.  Good indicators of a man who wants an expanded relationship with you include:  discussing the future together, showing you off to his friends, introducing you to his family, enjoying and maintaining daily contact, respecting your timetable for physical intimacy, opening up his feelings and revealing his sincere intentions to you.<br>     6. He likes you enough to want an exclusive relationship for keeps.  What you don't know after a few dates with a man is who you're competing with.  Two questions that remain are:  1) Does he like you more than anyone else in his life right now?  And 2) Does he like you more than anyone else he's ever known?  The answers to these questions will largely be determined in the future by the romantic chemistry that naturally develops between the two of you and the bonds of intimacy you start sharing with each other.<br>  <br>  The Bottom Line<br>  <br>  Men leave dating and romance clues all the time.  For you, it's just a matter of finding and interpreting these clues correctly and not jumping to unwise conclusions.  Remember, that gauging a man's level of sincere interest is a necessary skill that all smart women will want to possess in their pursuit of more enjoyable dating and successful long-term love relationships.|`|0D2CWwaMaa	He might like you, but if he teases the other girls and laughs at them he probably just likes to flirt with girls.|`|4Jm3LlBVaa	it doesnt matter how tall you are, just as long as you both get along with each other!|`|8RKA2KBUaa	Well, YEA! Y e;se would he give you so much attention? There's no way he'd waste his time unless he wanted something! I think you should ask him out....Oh, and height don't matter, I was dating this like REALLY short kid. I didn't care cause I liked him. Good Luck!|`|OPZMbITZaa	Stop crushing on midgets...|`|iP2dYaQQaa	If he didn't like you, he wouldn't bother with you at all.|`|kusudchnaa	most likely hun he does like you but he's a bit of a flirt. sit him down and talk to him|`|puxzpBrFaa	firat of all find out if he likes you for real, guys are weird they might seem to like you but not really. second weight size... doesnt matter. if you like each other than that wont matter. honestly it will also depend on you, if you care that he is shorter than you. for example my bf is my height but i am still growing so i might pass him so what i do is just not wear heels when i am going to see him. thanks to the style flats are popular so just wear those.<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|qLzQJ7G6aa	height doesnt matter...he may jus tbe a flirt...but he could like you too...you didnt tell us anything that he does to you that he doesnt do to anyone else so its hard to tell...good luck though|`|qOUeV1Y0aa	yes he does|`|xkrwLN7laa	tall chick, so I understand......<br>  Tell him how you feel and find out if he's just flirting or if you really likes you. best wishes!|`|mJmG3i4Oaa	height..weight..or age don't mean nothing when u have feelings for someone special!!! +P|`|nFelM9Wtaa	get someone to ask him. be to where you can hear without him knowing. if not this when he is around you show you like him and watch his reaction. sometimes we mistake like as friend for something else. try asking him out if you want. see there are alot of ways to find out
t0KAgdqpaa	Talk to him. Don't worry about body language. Especially at your age, your too young to read correctly and men are too young to know what they're saying with it. <br>  Your best bet is to TALK TO HIM. Then proceed [if uncomfortable to ask him out] to a group date [no pressure and pure fun!] after a while of seeing your personality, he should be gearing up to ask you out.|`|e067020ff447ba0c1bc5395d1b7783bcaa	Don't bother reading the signs. Just make it clear to him that you are interested and then if he feels the same, it's up to him to act first.|`|78DfeVSOaa	I suggest you "chill" (that's what you kids say now?) with him. Get to know him. I am a senior in my high school class. Iv been going out with the same girl through out high school since my sophomore year. I met her in my Latin class. My school has open lunch so one day i asked her if she wants to come to me to Subway ( i know how romantic ;)) and from there on we would talk n hangout.|`|0j6ID83Kaa	the most sure thing todo is to spand more time with him. dont only talk to him if he talks to you. after a while, if he likes you, he will have the guts to tell you. if not, then you should tell him. if you guys are close friends by then, he might tell you that he likes you too. nothing ever happens if you dont take a risk. that is how i got mine. (im a freshman too)|`|0pSOTMCVaa	Universal Rule...Bros Before Hoe's....|`|Ionq7kXdaa	You are on the right path... just keep flirting with him and talking and if there is a connection between you two something could happen.|`|SD2Yo5scaa	He's still feeling you out, but he sounds interested.  Don't push it yet|`|fUq4bqHPaa	get ur flirt on!!!!|`|gZGFyOx9aa	get to know him even more|`|ll7H76Fwaa	yea he likes you more then a friend|`|oKhTYkSgaa	My best advice to you is to let it develop on its own. It sounds like things are going your way, but usually pushing it has messy results. Just take things slow and don't rush anything, and you will have a good chance of getting what you want :)|`|sB6LAVCvaa	keep flitring with him and if he's intrested then ask him out. guys like it when girls ask them out instead of the guys asking the girls out.|`|vM9TZ8enaa	I study human interactions/behavior and relationship patterns in my spare time. I've found a lot out about the actual "signals" humans naturally send when they're attracted to another. If you give me some of the more exact details of the way he behaves around I can give you some really good clues. <br>  <br>  For instance: When you catch him staring at you does look down at the ground before looking away? That would be one of the many physical signals that he's looking at you with interest.<br>  <br>  I know tons of the little tid-bits like that. Send me a message if you'd like. If you have ever sat across from him, try and describe his behavior in detail to me.|`|wBlwnqCwaa	I think he likes you! I could be wrong because I cant read signs either. But anyway do you know any of his friends? If you do you can try asking one of them who he likes.
HVKFUvneaa	i think that u look cool<br>  and dare a say  a little hot in the picture!!!|`|bWfUlwBzaa	weird pic.|`|oKhTYkSgaa	You look like a junior high student with a little girl that wears makeup that's 110193485039485 times too dark for her.|`|t0KAgdqpaa	like your trying to hard.|`|p9C2FZnjaa	... you need to see my step mom Indira... not good... you need longer hair... maybe prep-cut ... but more hair... spikes are not working.|`|ryJUlbStaa	kinda cool|`|3KQpFHEBaa	I am older than you, and I think you look cute,<br>  I can tell, you are going to be a knockout in your adulthood.|`|4RwboLk2aa	I thought your sister is hot.
t0KAgdqpaa	If you really like her, call/text her saying how you feel. As in you like her etc. <br>  Or try going to her and talking to her. Do you know where she works? Leave a flower and a note.|`|Osn1xpu6aa	if you can, tell her all this in person. It's much more personal and caring. Also, it wouldn't hurt for you to bring flowers/any other little gift. <br>  good luck

CLEAN YOUR ROOM...DO HOMEWORK..MAKE BREAKFAST AND DINNER FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.
F0Gb6hhcaa	I am in the same predicament but I'm NOT the one who wants the relationship.  I think we'll be better off as friends and since nothings broke...why fix it?  If the relationship is so good now....why mess it up.  Just continue to be her pal, best-friend, and confidant...she'll love you in the long run for it.  Don't ask her anymore for a relationship...that's another way of ruining it.<br>  <br>  I've re-read what you wrote and I'm sorry...it sounds like you really love her.  It makes me think about what I'm doing with my own friendship.  We've kissed (small peck as well) when we were totally drunk.  It seems as if that's a good way to lead someone one because I don't have "those feelings" for him.  I guess, if you can't live without being her boyfriend or husband you should do what you said and "prove her wrong."  Just make sure you treat her amazingly and remember the 5 components to a lasting relationship:<br>  1. Love  2. Trust  3. Loyalty  4. Respect and 5. Honesty|`|8AWcwEkVaa	Awww that's so cute. You should just wait for the right moment, if you guys are meant to be she'll eventually realize it.|`|CPlkhWpKaa	do u watch the office??? well u r jim and she is pam|`|bDWDZ63Iaa	You can convince anyone to like you more than a friend.|`|99oYiMz3aa	i mean i have feelings for my BEST FRIEND! And i waited if i found some Else i liked then i would go with the other person. And i found someone else.possibly my dream Man! so you can wait or go for it remember " You don't know what you have until its gone" That was with me the hole time i was waiting. but i hope i helped, good luck!!|`|QykvwvHRaa	theirs only one way to know for sure when your playing around reach over and give a kiss, i mean the real kind and if she kisses you back with passion you know the answer if she cuts you off and pushes you back you , you will always just be her friend and you need to move on|`|ejcnzs4zaa	your screwd so just keep it like it is unless you cant so then go for IT|`|uga8mHMXaa	you could leave it alone and be depressed about it for the rest of your life and say man if i would of been there for her then i would be with her... you dont want to be that cat... you tell her this... tell her that you will always love her and you will always be her friend you will protect her and you will be there... and no matter what happens you will always be friends... i mean you guys dont fight now so why will you when your a couple... but dude you have to mean it or you guys will end getting hurt... so if that is how you feel then tell her that
LIrkSklFaa	Yep. I'm pretty sure she likes you.|`|Yiu4zXwKaa	She deff likes you.|`|0igEI2bbaa	Sounds like it, there is certainly a lot of flirting going on.|`|CNgSh1s8aa	i think its a sign she likes you!<br>  <br>  wohoo!!|`|d5b32d28222fc4939142f176a86c14d0aa	yeah if she told you to kiss her than she likes you|`|owzFxSjeaa	yes she really likes you .|`|NwEe0p4Jaa	Yeah, i think it's a sign that she's into you!<br>  <br>  =]<br>  <br>  Because honestly, if she wasn't i dont think she'd ask for a kiss at all haha.<br>  <br>  Well if you like her back you should definatley go for it!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kbb3mmcFaa	wow that's kinda weird, if she likes you that way and u like her, then say something to her about it.

It's up to u to decide.|`|lP9f4hvQaa	it could mean anything|`|oYbhl7NSaa	You were just hugging in the science lab without doing anything else?Was it a passionate embrace of two lovers or just a "brother and sister" huging is the question i am interested in finding the answer to.Also.How long were you hugging?is "hugging" your metaphore for a sexual activity?One thing is certain.She definitely likes you.The important question is how much.
t0KAgdqpaa	Because men whom are attracted to that type of woman are also the jealous type. And women like that get attention easily which makes them jealous. Be yourself, eventually you'll find a man worth your time.|`|11cf8f776163fff338cd696072ad743aaa	well, that is what attracted to them in the first place. then they ask, what if i had her? she is not an easy catch, then i would be happy. then they end up resenting her or feeling like she is too difficult to tame because afterall, she has a brain.<br>  <br>  some men don't want a challenge, they want a doormat.|`|0nW8wMBdaa	Well it indicates passion and excitment at the start and we like a challenge. i.e why do men climb mountains, it doesn't serve an logical thought, as for wanting to change them, calm them well I think that is because they don't want other men being attracted to them.|`|57p7DxC5aa	Because girls tend to become more slutty when they get a guy, they also tend to think they are hotter than what they are.|`|Be0CtbMzaa	because its very rude to wear headphones when they try and communicate about anything.|`|YpqQBfTRaa	Approach Any Woman, Anywhere And Know Exactly What To Say To Get Her To Give You Her Number And Go On A Date With You online.<br>  <br>  A huge dating service - thousands of members (like me and some friends) looking for friends, marriage, even bible-study.<br>   The site has a searchable emails, chatrooms, and more. <br>  Check it from the source and Find New Friends     <a href="http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-UfzxIps7fqDGlZCnXAWp_H4due5d?tag=fndfrnd">http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-UfzxIps7f...</a>

What do you say?|`|44OW4vwfaa	Not necessarily a reason...as to me...personality matters, it's the  down to Earth attitude of some English men that we do like at all.|`|AA12371259	From experience i agree English men are bigger. ALOT BIGGER.|`|GibEotV7aa	it's true that u r hot!<br>   But  i don't Know greater / lesser than american & anything abut u r stastics?|`|t0KAgdqpaa	I have always found English men attractive simply because they're more easy going. I definitely don't judge a man by his size, and any woman who does: you don't need in your life.<br>  The accents are very much a turn on, but personality is number one.|`|JBlJAJ5vaa	im english and my boyfriends penis is massive i havent seen americans but i do think english boys hae bigger 1ns but thats not why a girl should like you...|`|ae494W6Caa	The accents...alot of American girls love accents|`|yilREYWGaa	Im english and I prefer the english!<br>  My boyfriend is a farmer with a massive ding dong
zTOQmvZIaa	He's being hurtful, and that's lame of him. Those things were gifts!!!!<br>  I hate people like that. Arrrrrg<br>  <br>  <br>  Although, what's the other side of the story?|`|vj2pWs9Maa	He is totally lame.  A gift is a gift, you can't just take them back!|`|MSKS4h1Iaa	No, he did not have the right to do that. He GAVE those things to you. Which makes them yours. Would he have been right to take other things you own?|`|GNqQnAy9aa	Only if you considered them as payment for services rendered|`|t0KAgdqpaa	While he isn't right to take them because they are gifts and they are yours, you also don't have a right to take them back. One of those lame rules of etiquette.|`|uga8mHMXaa	haha he took those how funny... now thats a guy that knows what he is doing you should of smashed it!|`|ursCic7Gaa	Yeah like you said he was just trying to be controlling and hurtful... My sisters bf told her that he wanted her braclet back when they broke up but when its a gift you cant get it back unless you are going to let him in to take them..Legally the only time they can legally take things back are when they are strictly engagment or somesort of wedding anniversary gift|`|6JpuAPdYaa	What do you mean is he ALLOWED to do this? You let him so obviously he was allowed to. I think he was being a d**k.  I wouldn't have gave anything back - even if I really didn't want them, it would have been his lost. Or if I would have gave them back, they definitely would not have been in the same condition as when they were given to me.<br>  I'm vindictive like that, especially to people who are d**ks!!|`|ODnxYtlaaa	no just being an assh*le...you are right a gift is a gift...|`|U5oaaN8Vaa	THaT aiNT RiGHT!!<br>  TH0SE R THiNGS HE B0UGHT 4 U aND HE D0ESNT HaVE THE RiGHT T0 TaKE iT aWaY S0 U BETTER GET UR STUFF BaCK!!<br>  HE'S JUST MaD CUz HE N0'S HE STiLL LYKS U.<br>  ( WELL HE MiGHT STiLL LYK U) 0N THE 0FF CHaNCE THaT iM WR0NG S0RRY|`|aV8yxdeaaa	No, once you've been given something he can't just act like a baby and take it back because you broke up. They're not his to take back any more. You should haul his sorry *** onto Judge Judy and make him give them back.|`|fFbfgGXCaa	your boyfriend is being a dick.  by the letter of the law all those things are yours since he gave them to you.  kinda like when people get divorced the woman is allowed to keep the engagement ring because it was given to her. same rules apply
TZw9Q7pOaa	He could be nervous about calling you.  Email is not the same as talking on the phone.  Next time you write him.  Ask him his number and call him.|`|t0KAgdqpaa	If you guys are friends and are usually in regular contact, either way he likes you [as a friend or more different story]. If he asked for your number then he wants to get to know you on a more intimate level. If he hasn't called there are three possibilites. 1] he's just plain busy and hasn't gotten the chance 2] he's nervous and doesn't know what to say and keeps putting it off or 3] he's being a guy and trying to wait the three days before calling to show "he's not obcessed with you"<br>  If you have his number, go ahead and give him a call. He didn't change his mind. The reason he hasn't called, has nothing to do with you.|`|A4MmEXofaa	maybe his parents wouln't let him call|`|FAse5HFuaa	That hes probably busy but I think he will call u when u least expect it so jst dnt worry about it Im sure u have more important things to do than worrying about when some guy is going to call so so jst go wit the flow and u will get unexpected phone call I one day I think he s jst busy with something|`|gqHL1PPHaa	sometimes guys will wait a set amount of days before calling so they don't seem desperate. However, you 2 have known eachother for awhile so it may be another story.|`|l5MCXmTaaa	CLassic
