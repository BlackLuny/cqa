20090309131617AAJ1x7a	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Problems with a cat, what should I do?	I am a dog, my job is a household pet. I wag my tail for a living,  provide security, boost egos. My humans seemed to be pleased with me, but it was a sham! Because they got a cat! They dote on it. It has been in the house for less than a week, and it's already allowed on  the couch. I have been wagging my tail for years and I am not allowed! It does nothing, too, and just meows pitifully, and my humans jump, and run around it, and give it choicest bits of food, while I choke on dry cheap dog food! I had indigestion from it, and no one even noticed, they were all over the cat. It is so unfair, such an unfair return for my long faithful service. I am so unhappy and lonely. What should I do?

20090309132011AAM3ytL	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	What is the descendant's role?	I find a lot of information about the ascendant with various interpretations about the signs but when it comes to the descendant it is rather obscure. What I understand is that this is connected to our relationship with other people, but does it show in any way how we relate to others and how we perceive them? The ascendant shows how people see us. In relation to this, does the descendant represent the way we see others? As long as my ascendant is leo and my descendant - aquarius - does this mean that I am rather detached and cooler with others?

20090309135053AAx9uzl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	100% logic puzzle! anyone?	A man goes to an island which all of its inhabitants are people who either always tell the truth or always lie, but the man does not know how to tell the people apart (no physical clues for example).       The man travels on the island and comes to a fork in the road: one way goes to town which is the way he wants to go, the other way goes towards the monster's lair, so he cannot go that way. He has no idea which route to take.       There is a man sitting in the middle of the fork, and the travelling man may ask him ONE, and only one question, and that question must be able to be answered as "yes" or "no".       The inhabitants of the island speak a different language which the travelling man does not understand. He knows that their words for "yes" and "no" are "tish" and "tush", but he does NOT know which means yes and which means no. ALSO, since the inhabitants are either truth-tellers or liars, the travelling man does not know which kind of person the man is!      So, the travelling man can ask ONE yes/no question to the inhabitant AND must also be able to distinguish the answers "tish" and "tush" so that he knows which one means "yes" and which one means "no", AND figure out if the man if telling the truth or lying.       The travelling man needs to find out how to get to town and which road to take to get there, so what ONE yes/no question can he ask that will give him the correct direction, the answers to which "tish and tush" answer means "yes and no", AND figure out if the man is lying or telling the truth?????         THE ANSWER IS NOT:   "Did you know that there is an abundance of free beer in the city today?"       (in which case the travelling man would just follow the running inhabitant towards the city to get his free beer)

He is the one on the right, I saw his music video, he was the drummer and I couldn't help but feel attracted to him like I never have before.   In his interview he said he was filmmaker and drummer for a band and I loved his sense of humour and smile. I dont even know him it was pure coincidence, I just like him and I dont even know who he is. I never act this way towards men. This is the first and it seems odd.

I want to watch a Cleopatra movie now, and I am trying to decide between the one with Liz Taylor and the 1999 TV series. It seems like people use Liz Taylor's beauty (or Burton's looks) and the romance to justify why the film was good, but I guess I am just looking for the film being accurate and not just focusing on Cleopatra's love life but also on her role as a queen. Any ideas?

So I'm 18 years old and very shy, and my mom suggested I go to a Japanese spa to relax.      So I strip down and put on the robe they give you, and as I'm walking into the open area with all the mud baths and hot tubs, one of the workers there said "Oh, let me help you with this", and she yanks on the belt of my robe, pulls it RIGHT off my back and SHOVED me into the open area of people, while slamming the door behind me---leaving me out there BUCK NAKED!!!      I immediately covered my penis with my hands, and I started BEGGING the woman to let me have my robe back.      As I'm bouncing there on my tippytoes, trying to look into the window to get her attention, I hear all the people behind me LAUGHING at my bare misfortune.      Then, the most humiliating thing happened:      A 45 year old woman there gets out of her hot tub, puts on her robe, walks behind me and says "Just get in a tub, SWEET CHEEKS" and SLAPS my naked tush!!!      Why does my friend Sarah think this is SO hilarious???      What mental images are so hilarious to visualize that makes people laugh so hard?

I gotta start writing happy sh*t haha      Sing songs about the summer when the air was flowing fresh,   And the sun never missed a heartbeat as it steadied out my chest.   When times were different and the sun was more then just a light,   It was the reason for myself to wake up every morning.      Each morning I would wake up and run along the beach,   Growing flowers in my footsteps that I would leave behind.   And the the time came I would hate to go to school,   But I knew I would come home and see the family that I love.      But as the years went on things begun to drift apart,   Shoots were being fired from behind locked doors at hearts.   And the current picked up and washed my footsteps away,   Leaving dead rose petals to remain in their place.      But all is good in love and war as I have come to learn,   But when they mix together that's when things start to turn.   I'm walking down backstreet's just trying to find some drugs,   To pick my feet back up and learn to give a fu*k.....            As hours fold back into years it all is the same,   your the same wreck that I have known for years.   As I call you in the late hours of night,   You were always there to make me regret life.      As a runner you would run to me in my times of need,   You would never make things better but keep the pain there.   As heroin flows down my cheeks I can feel death upon me,   It's a feeling of knowing that your about to leave.      On mattress made of dust I used to sleep under lamps,   They would burn my skin until I was new again.   But each night was the same you would come around,   A dealer of death is all that you were to me.      I see you today with nothing but a weak smile on your face,   The heroin has lost all of it's taste.   I hope you relise that your life is about as useful as sh*t,   Stop pretending that your just doing what your told.   Stop pretending that your just doing what your told.

20090227153016AADAuUV	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Another song! Oh boy, you luck duckies!?	Please give honest opinions here. I wrote this in about 10-30 minutes. Pretty easy to tell what's it's about here. It's called Fornication Nation.      My school's been sweating something fierce,   It got a little toasty after just a couple beers.   There's a reason there's "high" right before the name,   Pissing on, pissing off, it's all the same.   Buy a car, just to wreck it, get a movie just to rent it,   Kill the smart, just for thrills, credit cards to pay the bills.      (pre-chorus)   Chug! Chug chug! Jer-ry! (X4)   F***in' it (X8)      (Chorus)   Welcome to the fornication nation!   Live it up- my pant's elation.   Smelled like that-for seven long years,   F*** it all, I have no fears!      Birds of prey? Prey no more!   Prey upon the dying whore.   Love like a razor, eyes like a lazer,   Shocked like a taser, nothing can faze her.   Act like a hater, talk like you're tamer,   Nothing is lamer, how much it will pain her.         And that's all, for the moment. And yes, I know it's NOT VERY GOOD. It's rather poppish. Even though it's slamming the whole pop-crowd...

20090309152432AA5dtaX	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Nick and Norah's infinite playlist.. are there girls like that?	Hello... So i'm 16. I'm pretty mature for my age, and i think i'm a pretty good person and i know who i am. I love indie (non-popular) music, i'm really not mean at all, and i'm a whole lot of other things. The other day i watched "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist" and i was shocked how good it was. I think i thought it was so good because the "Nick" character is just like me in about every way... so i could relate to the movie. Now, i've never had a girlfriend (I don't live near a city, i'm not that outgoing, etc.) But i was wondering if there are in fact girls like Norah in the world. Nick fell in love with Norah, so with me being like him, in a way i did too. She epitomized my ideal girlfriend... very plain, funny, not super hot, not trying to "fit in," very deep and genuine, and above all, a great sense of music... (pretty much all the songs in that movie i liked, several of which i already knew. If there aren't any girls like that at my age, could there be girls like that when i'm in college?... when girls have had a chance to figure themselves out and not care about what everybody else thinks anymore. Thanks!      By the way, this isn't a desperate post to meet girls... This has just been bugging me and i was hoping that my dreams could possibly one day see a reality.      Thanks

20090309152357AAsd01g	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Haunting in Connecticut legit? see http:www.cinemablend.com/previ…	The posting is by Ray Garton. READ ON!!!! .....    June 21, 2008 at 18:29 My name is Ray Garton. Back in the early nineties, I wrote a book called IN A DARK PLACE: THE STORY OF A TRUE HAUNTING. It was published as "non-fiction", but that was just marketing. I went to Connecticut to meet with the family involved in the alleged haunting of their former house, which used to be a funeral home. I was never able to see the inside of the home because the people who were living there by then wanted nothing to do with the "haunting", which they said was utter nonsense. It was my job to get the family's story down on paper and into a book. I worked with the family, and with the "ghostbusters" or "demon hunters" (whatever they happened to be calling themselves at the moment), Ed and Lorraine Warren. The article above claims "the family had little involvement" in this book -- that is simply a lie. They were DIRECTLY involved with the book -- it was them, the Warrens, and myself, nobody else. I attempted to get their story. Unfortunately, the members of the family couldn't seem to keep their "facts" straight. Their individual stories simply did not fit into one smooth hole. The article above states that the book I wrote "remains a source of controversy." The only source of controversy was the family, because they just couldn't keep their stories straight. I went to Ed Warren and told him the problem. He laughed. "They're crazy!" he said. "Everybody who comes to us is crazy, otherwise why would they come to US? Just do the best you can. You write scary books, right? That's why we hired you. Use whatever you can of their story, make the rest up, and make it scary." And that's what I did. The book IN A DARK PLACE is a combination of elements of the family's story and stuff I made up -- because it was a for-hire writing job, AND THAT'S WHAT I WAS TOLD TO DO. If this family is saying they had "little involvement" in this book, then they are bald-faced liars. They were involved from beginning to end, and THEY COLLECTED THE CHECK FOR IT. They were deeply involved in IN A DARK PLACE, and they were PAID for it -- their names are on the cover of the book along with my name and Ed and Lorraine Warren. I never got to meet their allegedly ill son -- I was only allowed to speak with him briefly on the phone. Although there was much talk of his illness, it was NEVER verified for me, although he did have a drug problem. It turned out that the girls in the family who claimed to have been groped by so-called invisible, demonic hands were actually groped by HIM. The Warrens and their nephew John Zaffis claimed they had videotape that clearly showed supernatural activity inside the house, and they told me numerous times that they would SHOW me that videotape. Somehow, during our time together, they just couldn't manage to find it. Not only did I not see that footage, I never saw an actual VHS videotape at ALL. Since my experience with the Warrens and this family, I've talked to other writers who have written books for Ed and Lorraine, and they've told me THE EXACT SAME STORY. This is how the Warrens have always worked. They find a very "emotional" family with claims of some supernatural activity in their lives, convince them there's money to be made if they just shape this into a better "story" (and this family was very eager to make money -- at the time I knew them, the mother was involved in some kind of interstate lottery scam), then they hire a writer of horror fiction to write it up as a book -- "Make it scary," Ed told me -- and they've got themselves a package, a piece of merchandise that they can hawk on talk shows and that the Warrens can discuss in their VERY lucrative lectures. And perhaps they can convince someone in Hollywood to make a movie of it. Of course, in THIS case, the book I wrote has been shoved aside and isn't involved in the making of the movie THE HAUNTING IN CONNECTICUT. It will be VERY interesting to see how much of this movie contains the material that I WAS TOLD TO MAKE UP. We'll see.

20090309155655AAPsTE9	Entertainment & Music;Movies	In movies, what is the correct term for a character that is never seen?	Sometimes in a movie or TV series, there is a character which is never seen - other characters talk about him/her, or even speak to him/her through a telephone, but no actor/actress is required for this role (not even for the voice). I'm sure there is a correct term for such a character, but I can't seem to find it.      An example of such a character is Sheridan, for those who know the British series Keeping Up Appearances. He's the son of the main character of the series and she's always talking about him, showing pictures of him to other people and so on, but we never get to hear nor see Sheridan.      Thanks for your help,      Marlon

Last week I was sobbing because I thought he   was gonna die. It was a shock that he didn't die last week, for me.   So I'm thinking he's done for now. And yes, I'm sure I'll be in frantic   tears. (I'm kinda emotional about 24)      Not to say that I'm not exited. I'm really happy that Larry is finally   gonna start (heaven forbid) BREAKING THE RULES! I have a high   hopes for Larry, if he actually lives to see next season.    (for those of you who don't know, 24 is not afraid to kill off anyone!)   So that should be pretty cool.       And I really like Jon Voights character so far. I think he's gonna make   an awesome villain.        Well I gotta run, so I guess I'll see ya on the other side.

20090309174140AAPqUQC	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Why are people rating peoples voices badly cause they don't sound american idol?	i mean the moment someone hears u sing a japanese song or a song in alanguage they dont understand, they rate you down, the moment u sound cute they rate u down, just because u dont sound like an american idol they rate you down, almost like other cultures dont exsist almost like other natures dont exsist, almost like only english voices exsist and only american idol voices exsist. i cant sing one son without some critizising me, that it doesnt sound good one because its in japanese and two because it sounds like i dont sing american idol. im tired of such discrimination i cant sing one song without that. the last commenter said to me, its overdone because it sounds overaly cute, and gave me like a 2 or a 4, and its like dissing my natural voice. why cant people just judge based on other factors that make a good song, and also if people rate poorly, why cant they just rate fairly, and give their reasoning. its not the fact that a persons voice sucks or not its the fact that no one is justifying their reasons behind their stupidity. what do u think?

We have been left with an amazingly low amount of jobs therefore a low amount of income which has turned into a never ending circle of poverty within some areas. Oil was discovered in the north sea which of course meant if kept to ourselves could flood vast amounts of money into the Scottish economy. We have been forced into the EU which tells us we cant even own fish in our own territory. We have the NHS but we now know that is underfunded to the point that you wait 7 hours in A and E (as i done last night). I think we would have been better off with our own government. The UK is now in a recession which we'll feel the effects for about another 20 years?. The much beloved English scone loving royal family are really Germans who changed the family name to Windsor during the first world war from, wait for it, Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha. We have a great history. We have invented many amazing things. Now the land is being over populated by the immigrants being allowed in like its a fair ground. We can't even call Christmas tree's by that name anymore, they are holiday tree's/lights. Have the English wrecked Scotland totally now or can we salvage some of it if we get some Independence? I hear the argument of us 'always moaning' and they are out of pocket because of US but if thats the case then let us go. We'd be fine like many other small countries.       Norway had roughly the same amount of oil and gas reserves and in 2004 its oil revenue was $38 billion US. Norway's net oil export revenues are forecast at about $46 billion each year. Westminister got a hold of it and used to it help out a mess they created, the already dwindling economy.       I think we'd be far better off don't you?      Everything i said is fact. You may check it for yourselves.

For anyone who knows him he was the lead singer of Escape the Fate. But then he was kicked out of the band and replaced because of his drug problems. He was also wanted for probation violation, and he was caught. He pleaded guilty to the charges, and therefore was sentenced to four years jail time. I heard from a friend that Ronnie got out a little earlier than planned.      So as far as I know he is out. But I just found out from somebody's myspace that he's in another band called From Behind These Walls. I would love to know if anybody would know the truth on this. And if you could help me find music by this band if it exist, I would appreciate it

I play the Bb clarinet and I already know the twelve scales, but is there a certain concert order to them?      What I mean is, I know that the major scales go C, G, D, A, etc, when played on a Bb clarinet, and the CONCERT major scales that correspond with those would be Bb, F, C, G, etc. But is there a certain concert order they are usually played in for, say, band auditions? I mean, is there a certain universal concert order that everyone uses (not something specific to your own school, camp, w/e)? Or is the Bb, F, C, G etc order the usual order?      I hope that wasn't TOO confusing...>__> Please try your best to understand my...weird question. It could be that I'm being paranoid about my upcoming band auditions, but I just want to make sure that I'm practicing the scales in the right order.

20090309124145AA7qnWs	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	What are guitarists who "just play for speed"?	I have heard some people say that guitarists only play for speed or have no feeling.      These include:   Yngwie Malmsteen   John Petrucci   Rusty Cooley   Michael Angelo Batio   Buckethead      I don't normally hear Malmsteen's emotion come out, but hey, we all have different ways of expressing emotion, I guess I just don't see/hear it when he plays.      Petrucci is a Progressive Metal guitarist, so he mainly plays technically challenging stuff rather than emotional stuff, but I have heard songs where they are quite emotional ("Wishful Thinking," "Lost Without You")      Rusty Cooley is wicked talented, but I have never seen him play with emotion.      Michael Angelo Batio usually just plays with technicality as well.      I completely disagree about Buckethead though. He is very technical, but can also slow it down and play with some raw emotion. Songs like "I Love My Parents," "Padmasana," and pretty much the whole 'Electric Tears' (2002) album.         Who is on your list and what do you have to say about the matter?

I was for McCain during the election, just because my family earns in the top 5%, and Obama is going to cost us a ton of money because of his tax plan, and he's kind of inexperienced. Now that he's president, I get a ton of stuff coming from the Obama's supporters at my school. So I was just wondering what mistakes Obama has made. Also, how many of you guys think he's doing a good job so far? By the way, Obama supporters, i'm sorry we don't have the same opinion, and I respect yours, but don't leave comments that don't answer my question.

20090309152953AA9L2V9	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Omg did you know msn is closing down?	Yeah...right.   If you get an email saying this, do not send it on. This is a scam.   My proof this is a scam?      1) MSN is owned by Microsoft, not "Andy and John".   3) There are billions of names available, I know, I tried a few out just to check. You can do that without making an account, so don't worry, I did not make more accounts.   4) Microsoft would send a global message, not ask 'send this to your friends'.   5) The news article that the links sends you to was written in 2005. That's five years ago!   This is obviously a fake. This question was made to inform every, and to hopefully stop this scam.   So if you get an email saying msn is closing down, ignore it.

Whether you're a night owl, living in a commune, or taking a vow of silence - you like to experiment with your lifestyle.   Expressing your individuality is important to you, and you often lie awake in bed thinking about the world and your place in it.   You enjoy staying home, but that doesn't mean you're a hermit. You also appreciate quality time with family and close friends.

We bought a fourth line for our daughter to get used to using a phone, (she is 6), but she forgets its even in the house because its so small.  We decided getting a regular land line would be better (though the cell was saving us like $20/month).          I've been trying to sell our cell phone with contract (craigslist & ebay), but no one wants the phone if they have to take over the contract.  Should I just give the phone away with contact?  We paid over $100 for the phone, but to cancel the cell phone plan would be $300.   It seems like either way I'm out of a lot of money.  :(      What do you think?

20090309144812AAQuqzk	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Just need your opinion??? Please Help!?	This is my opening paragraph to my biographical essay on lance armstrong. please tell me if it is good. P.S i know it is in the wrong section i just figured more people visit this area. Thanks in advance!      Some may see him as our nation’s most courageous athletic competitor; others may distinguish him as the individual who fought severe cancer. But overall he is an inspiration to those who have battled the repulsive disease of cancer. In 1999, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer, from that point Lance Armstrong has defeated not only this disease but has proven to all that he can obtain any obstacle that may come in the way of his success. As he once stated, “Beyond that, I guess there is no real ranking, but my commitment in the cancer community will increase significantly.”

Shay's house burns down on mother's day, when she tried to cook her mom breakfast. her mom got caught in the fire, and it killed her. Shay comes to Mady's house, crying her eyes out, and Mady says she can move in. Her mom doesn't care either, Mady just said "Shay, i already see you as a sister." then a narration, (MADY) "I love her, of course. of course i would let her stay here. but why am i getting a feeling that i'm going to regret this decision?"      that's ep. 1.      ep. 2 gets a little touchy ;D      __________ : Episode 2 - Is this my life? Or a drama movie?      MADY NARRATION: 3 days ago, Shae-Lynne came home from a party, drunk.   She was really hung over the next day, too.   Last week, she got sick.   Next thing i remember, she takes ME to a party, and gets ME drunk.   Now, she's getting all moody on me.   Like, every time i say something to her, she'll hesitate.   Like she's hiding something from me.   Now, my mom is helping flip my life, too.   Here is our conversation at the dining room table last night:      Taylor: Madison, hon.   Mady: What up?   Taylor: How would you feel if i...   Mady: What? If you what?   Taylor: Remarried.   Mady: WHAT!? NO!!!! nobody can take the place of my father!! NO!   Taylor: Won't you atleast meet him?

Are you insane?   *Shay runs into bathroom*   *Mady runs after*   Mady: I didn't hurt your feelings THAT badly!!!!   *shay throws up*   Mady: oh.   So what is wrong with you, anyways?   *Shay cries*   Shay: I don't ---   Fine! I can't take it anymore!!   I was late!!!   *cries*   Mady: Huh?!?!?   Shay: My period.   Mady: Oh, my god! Are you pregnant?   Shay: I think.   *Mady walks into bathroom, Shay follows*      (10 mins later, at the dining table)   *Shay cries*   Taylor: Sweetie, what's wrong??   *Shay crys more*   Mady: She's pregnant.   Taylor: WHAT!? How? Who!?   Shay: I don't know!!   Mady: I think she got pregnant when she went to that party, and got drunk.   Shay: Ok, wait a minute.   I thought it was water!   Then it just tasted so good....   Mady: Shut up.   Do you remember, err... getting into bed with anyone?   Shay: yes.   Mady: how many people?    Shay: 1. a guy.   Mady: oh, perfect. WONDERFUL.   Who was it?   Shay: I won't say.   Mady: I'm trying to HELP!!!   Shay: promise not to kill me?   Mady: No.   Shay: Fine.      Zach.   Mady: WHAT!? MY BOYFRIEND?   WAS HE DRUNK,TOO?

Shay: fine, whatEVER.   *hang out*(they sit cross legged on the floor)   Mady: You know, it's not too late to get an abortion.   Shay: I want this baby.   Mady: What about Acadamie`?   We'll only get into sim state if you have a child!!   Shay: Face it madz.   I don't WANT to go to Acad.   Mady: Shay, i love you. You are my best friend.

It was on at about 1:45 and it's been buggin' me all day. There was a song being played and it was sung by a female artist although I don't know who she was. It was a kind of Hip-Hop/Pop style song. I have no idea what the lyrics were but I think I made out 5 words from the chorus, although I don't think 4 of them were even words. It went:   Whoa whoa, whoa...hu-whoa shocked(?)   Any help would be appreciated, or if you could even just tell me the name of the artist or the name of the song I would be very grateful xD .

I'm a guy who is currently in college part-time. I work an awful full-time job on the side as well. I'm almost 20 years old, I'm 5'1, 228 pounds. I recently read a study that said tall and handsome people get paid much more than people like me. Do I have any hope at all in getting a better job? It took me a long time just to get the job I have now. Am I just dreaming for nothing? I always dream about becoming something great but I seriously think my body will inhibit me from doing so. I also know I will never get married due to my bad body. I wish I had a better body!    What should I do? I would rather die than have to work my job for the rest of my life!

20090309160309AA1mvNo	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	I'm 13 and have a very bad relationship with my mom...(WARNING: EXTREMELY LONG!!!)?	OK... This is pretty long, but I will try to make it as simple as I can...      So, ever since my mom got married to my step-dad in November 2008, my mom and I have had (and still have) relationship problems. I don't like my step dad at all. My hatred for him is so unbelievable that you don't even want to see the thoughts that I want to happen to him. This is because he has caused my only 2 siblings, that I was very close to, to leave the house and now both my brother (or siblings) hate our step-dad AND OUR MOTHER. My mom chose to represent his side and not stand up for us. She has a greater love for this man. One day, my little brother's teacher called our mom and said that he was behaving very poorly in school and class. When my little brother got home that day (when he was living with us last year), my mom and step-dad beated him with their hands and a belt. I would hear my little brother scream and his body bang against the wall as hard as you can imagine. On that same day, my little brother was so mad that he decided to go live with our dad (whom lives near Fort Lauderdale, FL). Before all this occured, my parents got divorced and my father moved out on my 11th birthday (May 17). OK. Let's skip to this year... So, sometime last week, I was working on my homework on my mom's computer until I came across some photos. When I looked at them, I was so in shock that I couldn't believe it. They were pictures of nude, old people and my mom and step-dad were in them/it!!! I saw my mom sucking other guys dick(s), being eaten out by other men and women. I even saw here posing naked in our jacuzzi!!! My mom never was like that/this until she met my step-dad. I always looked up to her as a big influence in my life until I saw those pictures. Now I think of her in disgust and as a slut and whore and everything bad. I get so mad when I look at her face and when ever she touches me (kiss, hug, handshake, etc.). She gives out the worst punishments ever! My cell phone is my life and my biggest protection. Where I live... It's very unpredicatable. There are a lot of creepy, old(er) guys that watch girls walk home after school and I have a big fear of getting raped. She could at least take away my radio or computer or something. And now when I look at the future, I see that it is horrible. I want a good future. If I do the same thing that my little brother did, which was move out and move to my dad's house and live with them, then I will be able to start thinking positive and do every thing to have a brilliant future. But I feel as if I can't do that if I continue to live down here. My step-dad kicked my oldest brother, of 21 years, out when he was 19-20 years old. My brother is stuggling as of today and I feel so bad for him. He wants to go to college and get a good job, but he's so low of money. I am so pissed with both my mom and step-dad. I want to tell her, "EITHER I GO OR HE GOES BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THE SH** HERE IN THIS HOUSEHOLD ANY MORE!!! IT'S NOT FAIR THAT LUKE AND MATTHEW DON'T HAVE TO COME HOME FROM SCHOOL AND FACE THIS CR** EVERYDAY!!! I WANT OUT!!!". Did I mention that they both argue everyday, non-stop, over the stupidest things?! It's so rediculous that I can't even barely find the love in that relationship. Anyways, I went to school today and got some transaction papers for me to move to a school that is closer to my dad's house because after I finish FCAT this month, I'm going to try to make this mission successful. I want out and I am so for real. I'm done with what I'm going through today. My mom has countinously gotten worser. She doesn't cook, clean, lazy. Everything oppostite that a good mother is like. I don't know what to do. Should i just leave forever and not talk to her anymore or just deal with reality?

I said; "Yes it is" and they still screwed up the order. I speak clearly almost perfect English and these retards still get my order wrong. I really believe they all do this on purpose, because it happens all the time to me and now I'm just sick of these numb skulls. I don't like cooking, so I think I will have to suffer and put up with this crap. If it happen every now and then, I wouldn't had gotten so upset today, but it happens all the time...
