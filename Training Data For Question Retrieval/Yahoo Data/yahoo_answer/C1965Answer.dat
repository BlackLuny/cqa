M7365DToaa	as the other answerers said, connecting to wifi hotspots is usually free (in places like McDonalds, coffee houses etc). Download an app called IM+ lite from Itunes, it's totally free and lets you connect to any messenger service (MSN, Yahoo, AIM, ICQ etc) so, yes you can use MSN provided you stay connected to your hotspot.|`|znLzOCHlaa	WiFi on the ipod touch is free. What you might have to pay for is the area you are getting thie WiFi in. Like a coffee shop would be free, but somewhere like a grocery store would have a cost to use it. There might be an App in the App store that has MSN on it, but it does come with Safari Internet browser. It comes in handy, and is very fast. It also has Email on it too. <br>  <br>  And YES, Ipod touches are worth the money. It is like having a cheap little laptop.<br>  <br>  Many Apps are free, but you should really think about getting a 50.00 itunes card for some good games and top of the line apps. Check on google if and where in Spain Has wifi. just type in the city and wifi, and search.|`|9be0CFy0aa	The wi-fi is free but can only be used if you have a wireless connection near you, so if there is wireless internet where you are staying in Spain then it should work. <br>  <br>  I dont think you can get msn on them but the iPod touch is really great, the touchscreen is excellent and you can download apps (some are free) which are pretty fun. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|mYSrB7yeaa	I really like my ipod touch.  Internet is free on them if you can find free wifi.  This isn't like an iphone, ie, it doesn't come with a phone network type internet.  Yes you can get MSN on them.  Wifi/MSN will work there if you can find free wifi.|`|tQNPy6d5aa	It all depends on where the WiFi is if it is in for example Starbucks it will cost $4.00 and hour but a lot of places will offer free WiFi where you can get on for free and if you get on a connection (either kind) MSN will work.

JHSZoPtPaa	It's like extra warranty, you can buy it while your original Apple warranty has not yet ended, it covers a lot more too. I'D recommend it for any Apple device because anything can happen. Yes it can be bought for iPhone at Apple.com on the Apple online store ( it's a great warranty protection plan ) !
3CJAUyqPaa	Yes.
TBYbzFIaaa	I'm sorry but there is no such website.  I have looked for a long time :-).

There are directory that can help you trace a cell phone number.

Still they offer you the best chance at getting the information you are seeking.
MJDSLmu4aa	emgs are the $h!t. all the ones  i tried at least. especially the zakk wyldes. the only thing i played that was drastically better were blackouts by seymour duncan.

w7Ffw6MYaa	Hello Nena, <br>  <br>  The whole problem is not the service at all, Virgin Mobile "says" they are working on the issue. Trust me, half of the Virgin Mobile phone representatives don't know what they are talking about. The problem is the phone, you have an older Super Slice. The issue with the older Super Slices' is that it has faulty software, with the newer Super Slices' they resolved the issued. I have heard of some people who had the same problem as you have (the resending of the same message continuously). <br>  <br>  I can understand where you can be annoyed (I would be). Unfortunately, there is nothing to do about the problem, the only resolution is to get a new Virgin Mobile phone. I know you said you didn't want the hassle, but its the only resolution. This is the only phone that I ever heard on Virgin Mobile that has this problem. Luckily, phone swapping is not as hard as it may seem. (I have swapped many phones.)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and sorry to hear about your misfortune. If you need any additional help, feel free to contact me via e-mail and I will gladly assist you :-)|`|7YOKSvRTaa	Call VMU again and tell them abt the problem.. if they dont fix it . they will send you a replacement phone

It is a little silver sticker that says Microsoft on it. Yes you should still be able to send it in for repair if it has not been opened and still has the warranty sticker intact.
ihYl3mJqaa	You won't. The outputs you require are for  PC type system. Keep the PC system on the PC and get a HTIB, less money and better results.
JzxS4jBDaa	It is basically personal preference. But When I got my 360 (Christmas 2007, but it was bought/used earlier that year.. Don't ask), I kept it vertical. But then it scratched ONLY my Rock Band 1 disc. I then put it horizontal, and I would still get disc errors in Rock Band 1, and then later in GH3. I also have gotten errors in Rock Band 2, GH:WT, and I think a couple of other games. So I put mine back vertical.<br>  <br>  I think it didn't help tho that I placed my Wii (vertical) on my 360 while it was horizontal. But the Wii is light enough to not cause any harm.. The 360 itself can just scratch discs.<br>  <br>  So basically it's your choice. I think they made it that way for space issues. Also maybe because certain face plates or skins look better when the system is one way or another.. Good luck tho with making sure your discs don't scratch!~|`|3kgqmJ6Laa	it really doesn't matter.  it's how ever you want to put it.  just be careful if you but it vertically.  you have to make sure the disk is in the tray securely....if not the disk will spin out and the lens will scratch it.<br>  <br>  i have mine horizontally.|`|Gw4vYwVDaa	personal choice you decide|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	Newer console doesn't matter. Older ones horizonatlly becuase vertically they like to scratch disks. Newer as in purchased late last year or early this year. With the newer console it doesn't really matter. There is some controvesy that horizontally the XBOX gets more airflow. I have tested both ways and the bottom of the console stays cooler when vertical. Untill someone does a comprehensive temperature test know one will really know.|`|A77eG7jWaa	You can place it anyway you like as long as you dont block the air vents on the sides. I have mine horizontally and i've never had any problems with it overheating or scratching discs, which can become a common problem if your Xbox isnt properly taken care of. either way just make sure it is on a level surface and free of obstructions,|`|oJJmJTuaaa	However you want. I put it horizontal because it runs better and is more stable.

You get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  Entry level consumer high definition camcorders include the Canon HF series and Sony HVR-CX12 for flash memory and the Canon HV series and Sony HDR series for miniDV tape.

q6uyloYdaa	The cheapest I've ever seen it is at Gamestop for $40. It's an unbelievably difficult to find game. You may just have to deal with the price if you really want it. I can only imagine someone selling it for cheap if they don't know what they have.
TBYbzFIaaa	What kind of phone is it? Are you sure it supports file transfer?<br>  <br>  Yeah Razr's require you to have a seperate software suite.  If you do some extensive searching you might find one for free.  This is the one that I have seen, from motorola, <a href="http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/phonetools/" rel="nofollow">http://direct.motorola.com/hellomoto/pho...</a><br>  Otherwise you should be able to bring it into your providers store and get the pictures and contacts off of it.  If you bring a usb jump drive with you, they can put it all directly onto that.  If they say they can't, they are most likely just being lazy haha. And you should come see me at US Cellular :-D

Save your 75 dollars until you have around $130 then go buy a wifi adapter for $99 with tax about 105- 110 and buy a xbox live card subscription 12 month for $59 in Canada and $49 in America, you get 1 extra month when you buy it so 13 months of xbox live gold. since IM guessing you have a wireless router buy a wifi adapter.|`|s115uaybaa	buy a wireles adapter for your xbox to hook up to the router. they sell them at any electronics store or game store|`|cHh0PTTsaa	The cheapest way is to buy a very long ethernet cable and run it along the baseboards to your router.  Remove it when you're done with a gaming session.  On eBay you can get 100 feet of ethernet cable for around $15 USD, shipped.|`|8bFgKg99aa	I am not sure what you talking about but i hope this help you.  You can buy a wireless router, and a xbox360 wireless network adapter and you play anywhere in the house without drilling, or you call 1-800-4MY-XBOX|`|woqSJNDiaa	your only option is to buy a wireless connection for the back of your xbox but that will be around 90$

W0ZsuxRTaa	go to the apple store. they're really good about fixing this stuff and making it easier on you. my friend was missing the vibrate button on his phone and when he went to the apple store, they just gave him a new one for new charge! they transferred his games and old texts and everything. so find the closest apple store to you and make an appointment asap.|`|95q15AjBaa	well be4 u take it to the apple store try holding both power and home for about 25 secs and then home for atleast 8, maybe this will wake it up.

They aren't that hard to find, check the internet, I know the store Brookstone sells them or you could probrably take them to company in your town that converts them for you, which ever one works for you easiest.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help.

RpCwfcRzaa	Some original Xbox games work on the 360 and Soul Calibur 2 is one of them. You need to either connect to Live to download the required update or download burn, and install it from xbox.com. Over Live, all you need to do is connect and put the game in. A prompt will come up asking you to update. If you play offline, you will need to go here <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backwardscompatibility.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/backward...</a> to download the update.|`|W5E8GhiBaa	Then once you get bored with that, then get Soul Calibur IV.

p1dcw35Qaa	You can get a 1080p tv in 26". The real question is, s it worth it? Most studies have shown that TVs under 50" (at normal viewing distances) look the same at 720p as they do at 1080p. So, if you can find a 720p with similar specs, save the $ and buy it instead of the full 1080p.<br>  <br>  As for a suggestion, I like this 32"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/partNumber/5293623/c_1/1|category_root|Home+entertainment+and+sat+nav|12108813/c_2/2|cat_12108813|Televisions|12108983/c_3/3|cat_12108983|32+inch+LCD+TVs|12108984.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.argos.co.uk/static/Product/pa...</a>|`|3d9513bff802e1bb1c92ea294d374e25aa	1080p (Blu-Ray) Is 1920 x 1080 pixels (size is irrelevant). A screen from 26" to 103" displaying a true 1080p image is very impressive. <br>  <br>  1080i - Broadcast HD media, is also very impressive across the size ranges, only not quite as rich as Blu-Ray. Go get your new 26" HD tv !!!<br>  <br>  Size is not important.......in this case.|`|fwdsp3dVaa	It doesn't have to be, but 1080p could be a waste of money!<br>  <br>  See the thing is, the smaller a TV is, the smaller the pixels are! Otherwise every TV size would have a different resolution! This isn't the case now is it!?<br>  <br>  Below a certain size, the pixels get so small that packing more of them into a certain screen size becomes irrelevant! Your eyes will not see a difference in the picture quality! However, the larger the TV is, the larger the pixels will be and the larger they get, the fuzzier the picture will look! So having more pixels in a larger TV makes perfect sense! And depending on how close you sit to your TV, 1080p is really only needed on screen sizes 42-50" or larger!|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	Our Panasonic is 32", and 1080.

boO0hTRmaa	In most areas you will be able to receive more stations.  In my area we get substations ( stations that are tied in with regular stations). i.e: Our PBS has 4 stations tied into it.  So our channel 9  also has 9.3 Create Channel, 9.4 Spanish PBS. When you set up your digital box, do the auto program feature.<br>  You may need to upgrade your antenna. <br>  For more info go to www.dtvansewrs.com  and www.antennaweb.com<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|oYP7Ug1Yaa	yes, it will, but it won't be but 3 to 5 new channels. Most of the time, the new channels will be variations of the ones you already have. The signal strength, or how good a signal you have, isn't very great right now. Sometimes you might even have to get a new anntenna to get a better signal. <br>  <br>                 hope i helped.|`|TWeRUgXxaa	na i bought it and it gave me less! it really depends where u live cause i got a friend in san francisco andhe recieves over100 channels free! unlike me i used to get like 12 with the antenna and now i recieve like 4 but i just switched to cable|`|lhAVoXNMaa	no it will only bring in the regular antenna channels|`|U23gGnG8aa	yes. you should get more from each of the 3 channels you get now. i have a set top box and had to delete some of the channels because there were too many for us to watch. too many options.|`|GKMYQmHaaa	the dig box will with the help of your antenna give you more to choose from  most networks have more than 1 signal|`|23c9fc7bde15c121fd9aadacf01a0339aa	No. A box at the end of the cable cannot receive more stations than your aerial can detect. <br>  <br>  I think that you are confusing analogue with digital.<br>  <br>  Your existing analogue transmissions will only be your 3 stations, but when you connect a digital converter box (we call them Freeview boxes in the UK) to the same aerial you will detect the digital signals being transmitted - if there are any in your area.<br>  Normally there are many more digital channels available for each transmitter than there are analogue channels.<br>  <br>  Before you buy a digital box ask the dealer exactly how many extra channels you will get - and what they are. Generally a "choice" from 50 or more tv stations is only a "choice" of which crummy repeat you want to watch. Very few offer any new programming,<br>  <br>  You will not get good digital reception from rabbits ears. The only sure way is a roof mounted high-gain aerail.<br>  <br>  If you really are out "in the sticks" then get satellite. It'll be more reliable and give you even more choices of repeats and shopping channels and religiuos channels etc.<br>  <br>  Enjoy.|`|uZEmRPBFaa	Yes, if the original channels are offering them. I live in the Chicago IL area and several of the local channels are offering sub-channels.
ElvQTpUVaa	SD Card?  You download the songs to your computer, and then transfer to your card.  Once hooked up to your PC, the card will appear in "my computer" to be a removable drive.  You just copy paste the files from your HD to the card.<br>  <br>  To actually get the music in the 1st place....<br>  <br>  If you want free music (and are too lazy to read the answers posted every time this question comes up here, which is a few times a day) then read.<br>  <br>  You have some options.<br>  <br>  You can buy the music online at legit sites like iTunes.  If you don’t have an iPod, you can use any number of free programs to convert the mp4 to mp3.  The problem is that much of the stuff on pay sites is covered by DRM that limits what you can do with it.<br>  <br>  You can rip music from CD’s – helpful if your local library is stocked, or you have friends that share your tastes but are okay with paying for them.<br>  <br>  You can stream music from an internet radio station through your PC, then use a program like Audacity to record that stream as an MP3 or wav file.  You can scan through that recorded stream looking for the songs you want, then copy that part of the stream containing the desired song to an excerpted copy of the larger stream  (audacity handles this as well).<br>  <br>  If you must use peer-share, you run the risk of infecting your pc by 1) downloading the client program, because it may have viruses; 2) visiting the webpage that hosts the program, because it may contain malware of its own & 3) downloading the media which (in peer-share) comes from other users.  No Peer-Share system can guarantee the safety or quality of its media.<br>  <br>  I’d avoid Limewire and its variants.  I tried limewire a few weeks back after years of happy reliance on winmx and emule.  It was nothing special – downloads weren’t fast, selection wasn’t great.

JzxS4jBDaa	Well, the Xbox 360 is a great system, until the red rings show. According to a GameInformer magazine, "You might not know it, but each Xbox 360 comes with a free game. It's called Living on Borrowed time. It starts the moment you buy the console..." Basically, each console os still prone to the inevitable rings..<br>  <br>  In another article I read (not sure if it is the same issue, but it is still GI), it said that Microsoft tested the Elite systems for this happening. And, not surprising, their test subjects (which they claimed wouldn't get the Rings of Death), got the Rings of Death!!<br>  <br>  Microsoft for me always bugs out and can be obsolete as compared to other products. But if you are willing to take the chance and buy it, great! Also, I think it is warranted for 3yrs from the time you buy your console (but don't hold me to that..) Then Microsoft will repair your console for free (or if it failed epically, they will send you a refurbished one). I forget if my dad was able to do this, but I am not sure of the store you buy the console from will give you a new one. You have to check with your local retailer on that one.<br>  <br>  I say, take the chance. Either way, you will be able to have a console (whether it never gets the Rings, or if you ship it to Texas).. Your bf will love his new 360!<br>  <br>  *I have the core (or what is now known as the Arcade) system. I *knock on wood* have not had the red rings yet. My dad has had the Pro system and had his catch the rings twice. My dad currently owns the Halo system (for a while now) and has no issues so far. One of my friends had their Xbox for a year or so and just got the rings. (They also had the arcade/core version).. So basically, right now, the chance of a system getting the rings at some point is there. It's just WHEN they get them that's random. (And as I said before, even Microsoft's superb Elite test consoles even got the Red Rings of Death!!)|`|RpCwfcRzaa	The Arcade is the basic version. What you want is called the Pro. The chances of getting the red rings has gone down, but there's still a possibility especially with the Pro. The best way to avoid the red rings is to get an Arcade version. They're the only ones as of today that come with the new Jasper chipset which reduces the chances of getting the rings. Of course by getting the Arcade you don't get the extras that the Pro or Elite have so you'll have to decide for yourself. As for the rings, if you do get them, Microsoft will fix or replace the console free of charge within the first 3 years.|`|AA10690306	Ok, as an XBox360 owner for 3 years here are some things to know. 1)  The new units have a better cooler running video processor with a much lower risk of the Red Ring of Death.  2) if something does go wrong the customer service is excellent and replacement times are down to about 2 weeks.  3) the Sony PS3 owners will tell you how much better their systems are while hiding the fact that they are crashing at least as often now because the BD drives are faulty.|`|oJJmJTuaaa	They still break, but it is a reasonable percentage now. (2%) Three flashing red lights will always be an issue. It can be caused by millions of things, some of which not hardware related. Something to know is that the system is loud and if you move it when a disc is spinning the game will be scratched. The systems are the same internally, no system is more reliable then the other. If you have any more questions feel free to email me.|`|dI7xEPHcaa	as an xbox owner i would say go for it, apparently the red ring problem is sorted in most new machines, however i bought my machine second hand/pre owned and did get the red ring problem, xbox/microsoft was amazing they sorted everything and gave me a new machine, so even if it does go wrong which it very rarely does it will be sorted free of charge......get one x|`|YweJ1PfUaa	the best bet you have is purchasing the xbox360 pro the issues aren't solved you but im pretty sure microsoft has some sort of warrranty on it.So hoping for the best is all you can do|`|3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	The newer console are way better than the original that came out. Yes RROD can still occur, but there is a 3 year warranty in place so that if it ever does happen Microsoft will repair it for free. Don't worry and buy one for him.<br>  <br>  Things that have been done.<br>  New BenQ disk drive to reduce noise and avoid scratching of disks.<br>  New heatsink added to GPU to reduce heat.<br>  Able to install games to hard drive to reduce wear and tear on disk drive/ game disks.<br>  <br>  They are all the same console. The only differnce is the elite is black and has a 120Gb HD. The Pro has a Chrome bezel and 60Gb HD. The arcade is all white and a memory unit built into it. They are all equally prone to and of the problems.

ElvQTpUVaa	Which one what?  You just said, "if i download limewire" - Limewire is one program.  There are different programs that do the same thing, but why would you want any of them?  LW connects to a network that is no better for getting any media than other programs like winmx or emule.  It's useless for video and no better for audio.<br>  <br>  "will it mess up my computer?"<br>  If you give it too much bandwidth, or if you get a malware version of it, or download malware-infested files with it.<br>  <br>  "how will i put the songs on my ipod/iphone"<br>  the same way you would any mp3's.  Viruses aside, there is nothing unique about the format of music you get through limewire.|`|MWDl8iowaa	Ge the basic version. Limewire can only mess up your computer if you're not paying attention to what you are doing. To put the music on your ipod ,download iTunes and add that folder to the library.
r7tzSp9caa	If all songs are still on your iPod, here is a way.<br>  Simply use this iPod-to-iTunes transfer program called iPod 2 iTunes <a href="http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-2-iTunes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutensoft.com/Utilities/iPod-...</a><br>  <br>  It is a handy program specially designed to help transfer all music/playlists/videos from iPod back to iTunes in a direct way.

So go into itunes and press recover and it will all be fine, trust me<br>  <br>  :D|`|eArLd5taaa	I say, go back to the store from where you bought it...and ask and show the problem to the employees...they will know what to do :)|`|axASQsMwaa	you can try resetting it?or restoring it which will delete all the songs and stuff u have on it!!
3d97e0903de2c4ce8a8b79492024ff4aaa	If you have gotten the RROD before call MS and send it in saying you just recently got it. They should repair it if you havn't voided your warranty.|`|oJJmJTuaaa	Say you have three flashing red lights and Microsoft will fix it for free. That's all you can do.

You will want to make sure your television can support at least 1080i to get the enhanced effect.  <br>  <br>  To get the cable at the lowest possible cost, I visited Amazon and purchased a 6ft cable for $10 including shipping!  Monster HDMI cabling or clones are only needed if you want to run the cable for longer than 6ft in an area with a lot of EMI (Electron Magnetic Interference).<br>  <br>  I find the my Sony Bravia 46" LCD gives about 25% better picture when using HDMI.  However, also remember that HDMI is also sending the audio digitally which can yield crisper highs and deeper bass for you listening pleasure.<br>  <br>  Here are a few of my recommended HDMI DVD players, they are cheap compared to HD players and allow you to view your existing DVD collection without the hassle of buying new HD media!<br>  <a href="http://www.epinions.com/review/Sony_DVP_NS700H_Player/content_453891165828" rel="nofollow">http://www.epinions.com/review/Sony_DVP_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epinions.com/review/Sony_DVP_NS77H_B/content_451914534532" rel="nofollow">http://www.epinions.com/review/Sony_DVP_...</a>

The Stratagus engine is one. Battle of Survival is the main mod that has been made for it. You can make your own mods fairly easily too.<br>  <br>  Another one is called Warzone2100. This was a commercial game that has just been released GPL. It's very much like C & C but more focused on vehicles, also you can custom design your own vehicles. And the main resource is oil, rather than ore, which is sensible.<br>  <br>  For a good LAN game try Netpanzer. Nobody really plays it online anymore but it's great for LANs.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	What gives a camera its picture quality?  <br>  It is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>   <br>  In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.<br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ...<br>  <a href="http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices.

Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.  <br>   <br>  For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera.

3CJAUyqPaa	What computer are you using?<br>  <br>  USB (Universal Serial Buss) is a connection method and communications protocol. Consumer-grade internal hard disc drive and flash memory camcorders use this connection to copy video data files to the computer for editing.<br>  <br>  MiniDV is a digital tape format typically used by consumer and professional grade camcorders to store DV or HDV video captured by the camcorder. MiniDV tape based camcorder's DV port connects to the computer's firewire port for high quality DV format digital video importing. Using a USB cable to connect the camcorder to the computer *might* allow USB streaming if the manufacturer provides a driver and your computer's operating system can support it, but this is highly compressed video and is very low quality when compared to high quality DV format video.<br>  <br>  Firewire, IEEE1394, DV and i.LINK are all the same thing. They are not USB. If your computer does not have a firewire port, hopefully it has an available expansion slot so you can add a firewire port. If there is no expansion slot available be advised that USB-to-firewire hub/adapter/converter/cable things do not work. Your other options are to use a computer with a working firewire port or get an external "capture" device and import analog video through the camcorder's analog/composite AV-out port.<br>  <br>  Since you did not tell us what computer you have we have no idea what its capabilities are. Answering your question is not possible.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	If it's a minidv camcorder, you need a firewire connection.<br>  If it's a minidvd camcorder you have to convert the files using a file converting program like handbrake (free download).<br>  If it's a hard disc, then download using the USB cord.<br>  If it's a flash drive, you can either use a card reader or USB and copy and paste the photo's from the card to the file of your choice.|`|jje1mNJEaa	Firewire, highest bandwidth, best quality and throughput from a tape.<br>  <br>  If its flash memory, it has to be a express card, like the ones used by sony and panasonic on their $3000+ models to compare with firewire.

FFcJFPadaa	Remove your battery for about 30 seconds then put it back in... wait for your phone to power up and check on the curser, if the curser still isnt working correctly you may have dirt built up beneath the ball, in that case you will need to remove the plastic covering around the ball and remove the ball... if you have compressed are blow it out with that, if not try blowing in there to remove the dirt and then wash the ball with rubbing alcohol. :) hope this helps :)

Each phone has a code that you can type in at <a href="http://tinyurl.com/CanIUpdate" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/CanIUpdate</a> to find out whether firmware updates are available for your phone.<br>  <br>  For examples Nokia sells phones through network operators and they insist to have it customized (some software added, some software removed, special graphic package ...) and that software variant is controlled by those operators. Nokia may release firmware for their unmodified phones in a much faster rate than for operator's customized versions. If you have such a variant phone you might have to wait for a long time and all you can do is contact your operator and ask for support if there are any annoying bugs on the phone.

qEET2iA6aa	Usually the case with Google Talk and Yahoo Messenger on the BB is that they are just links to their respective webpages so you can download/install these apps yourself if you want to. So no, you won't find them in the application list because they aren't actually installed. You can however choose to hide the icons, but they aren't taking up any significant amount of space on your BB.<br>  <br>  Also, while talking about Apps, I suggest you look at Viigo and Vlingo. Viigo offers RSS feeds, weather, sports updates, stocks, flights, package tracking, etc etc... and Vlingo takes advantage of Blackberry's voice recognition from Voice Dialing to allow you to do many other things like dictate a SMS message, Email, Google or Yahoo search query, Twitter/Facebook status updates, etc etc with just your voice and it is very accurate.

The 12,1A part is the most important part. No other versions but Jasper have this. It can take some searching.<br>  <br>  No versions up to this point are RROD proof.

That erases the photos, but also erases "housekeeping" stuff and errors. It isn't a guarantee, but formatting improves your chances of trouble free use of your memory card.<br>  <br>  There are many mobile options for storing and viewing photos, your camera is a very bad choice for that.

vgxEN4MGaa	Yes you can.<br>  It is illegal.<br>  I am sharing this with you to educate you only.<br>  <br>  BLU-RAY DISCS<br>  <br>  Firstly, copying blu-ray movies to your PS3 is a big no-no. Basically, very few programs can crack the copy protection (those who can cost money to buy and are not guaranteed to work 100%).<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you do manage to crack it with a program, the actual process of copying would take ages because blu-ray movies are about 25GB in file size. (So if you have a 40GB PS3, you can fit 1 movie).<br>  <br>  If you want to download blu-ray movies from the internet, this would take time because the uploads tend to be 12-13GB each which could mean days downloading 1 movie. And after you would need to buy a blank blu ray disc and a blu-ray burner which costs alot.<br>  <br>  Finally why go through all this trouble when you can buy a blu ray film for a good price now? Just be a good citizen and buy legal films.<br>  <br>  DVD DISCS<br>  <br>  This is another story.<br>  <br>  DVDs are converted to 700MB files and are available to download from the internet quite easily, the copy protection has been long cracked and pirate DVDs are available everywhere.<br>  <br>  PS3 will be able to play them if the movie file is DivX encoded (most films are which is lucky). To find and download films go to torrent sites such as www.mininova.org or www.isohunt.com or www.piratebay.org and search for a film.<br>  <br>  Copy the file onto a memory stick and put it onto your PS3 for playback.|`|jxpV13rTaa	you sure can, and since i live in canada it is not illegal. i dont do it directly because i dont get the dvds myself. my friend burns the blu ray dvd and i simply place it into the disc slot. after i just go to the disc and click copy and it copies the disc right to the harddrive (takes about 20 minutes). dont knwo why people are saying you cant do this, its beyond simple.|`|7QEcLWuzaa	Aimersoft DVD Studio Pack is the most powerful multimedia conversion tool that it support various video formats.

vgxEN4MGaa	For your media server, i recommend TVersity (Google for it), its very easy to setup and use and is fully compatable with PS3 and 360.<br>  <br>  To protect yourself you can do a few things.<br>  <br>  1. Use a wired connection with ethernet cable, this way no data is being sent around, only through secure connections.<br>  <br>  2. If you choose wi-fi, make sure your connection has some sort of WEP or WPA encryption. All this is really is a password of random numbers and letters you need to enter before someone can connect to your network. (If you currently dont enter a WEP key before you connect to your network then YOUR NOT SECURE.).<br>  <br>  Log in to your router, on wireless settings pick a security option and enable it to make sure your secure.<br>  <br>  3. For further security find another option in your router settings called MAC address filtering. Jot down the mac addresses of your PS3 and computers and enter them in the setup page. <br>  <br>  This will only let your devices connect to the network (each device has a unique MAC address so no one outside will be able to connect).<br>  <br>  <br>  This is great security for your network, and will stop the common person. But if someone is determined, they could crack the wifi encryption with a program and fake their MAC address to hack your network. But this is usually government stuff lol|`|AA11951021	Just make sure you enable the security on your router (WEP).

42tTsVuxaa	I would not expect too much, it would be ok. <br>  <br>  Family moments are special and worth keeping. <br>  <br>  I Mostly advise people to get Mini-dv camcorders. the reason for this is that they are easy to use, picture quality is very good. Probably after a while you will have loads of videos, Tapes are cheap and you can just leave the video on them (providing you look after the tapes) until you decide to edit them, you know removing all the bad shots, and turn it into something others will enjoy. Mini-dv is easy to get onto your computer and you dont need a super computer to edit them. Hard drive cameras and memory card cameras need a reasonably powerful one to edit the video. <br>  <br>  Its your choice your money, but read a little and get the best you can for your money<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  RR|`|fecUjSr1aa	between the 2 choices, i'd go for the 2nd one. those flip cameras are very limited in features. so if you're buying one, get the 2nd one ...<br>  <br>  however, i do have a suggestion (that is .. if you're interested) .. it requires an 8gb memory card which is another plus on your expenses and with that size, you'll have to transfer to your computer to create more space next time you'll use it to shoot videos ..<br>  <br>  I suggest (budget permitting) you get one with a bigger internal hard disk memory storage. I got one with a 30gb storage and can take hundreds of still pictures and hours of videos (that's right .. pictures and videos). its about $300 (US) so I guess that would be about a tad over 200 pounds. <br>  <br>  Its very easy to work with the computer, never had any problems with it.

Most medium format camera's don't go below about $7,000 just for the part the connects the lens to the sensor (Does not include sensor or lens) and then add whatever the lens is (I don't know, probably another $500 for an okay one) and then for the sensor expect to pay about $30,000 If it is a new one. Oh course you would not buy one of these unless you are a millionaire, or a company owner that has to take architectural pictures, And this camera being on the higher end of even medium format, people have been talking that this 39MP behemoth will cost in between $30,000 to $40,000 usd when it is available. If you NEED a medium format, just get one that is available now like a mamiya of any current med format hasselblad's, If you don't really need something this expensive than sony has a DSLR out (They took over konica minolta so if you had any of their film slr's the lenses will work) and It's a 24.6mp and you can bet it gives some nice shots with its full frame. Also the sony will run you around $1000-$2000 definitely my next camera.

JhC6BvPpaa	Hi Ian, yes I do this by opening Windows Movie Maker, 1st drag the movie file into the 'imported media' area, then drag the movie file onto the 'time line', then using the + button next to video, clic on it, it shows a separate video track and an audio track that runs simultaneous. You then 'grab' the audio track and drag it to the Audio/Music bar below. The video 'disappears'.<br>  <br>  Then clic 'PUBLISH MOVIE', but then it asks where you want it to go - say desktop (so you don't lose it), and give it a file name, clic what quality you want, then 'GO'... <br>  <br>  You should end up with an MP3 file without the movie.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|7QEcLWuzaa	Aimersoft DVD Ripper is the most powerful one that I have used before.

1F6KJt0oaa	It will require you to figure your exposure ahead of time.  Your camera won't be able to do it for you.  It will also require a really slow film.  Set your shutter speed to B and use the shutter release cord.  Pressing the button and holding it will cause wicked shake.  Slow film is needed because faster films reciprocity fails much sooner than slow films.  Fuji Neopan Acros is one of the best long exposure films made today.  My understanding is it will out perform the ISO 50 films out there even. I am not sure what kind of meter you can use to figure an exposure that long.|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Put it in Bulb mode and hold down the shutter for as long as you want.

6ff2b1486d29a23be2c10f496cbd1f3caa	im not going to tell you to get anything but i am going to recommend a phone. i recomend getting the Samsung Eternity. i don't have one, but i have been doing research day and night for it and everywebsite i went to the eternity got at least 1 more star the the LG VU. the touch screen is very responsive, easy texing, EXELENT camera, good colors, and easy to figure out. <br>  <br>  though i do recomend if you get a touch screen, to keep the dents out, buy a little SILICONE case to get around the outside back. you don't have to take it off to use the phone at all.

pZGLhV2Waa	Yes if it is the same thread size. The 17-40mm has a 77mm filter thread size so if it is the same then yes it will fit. That said be aware that the optical quality of these add on lenses is very poor. If you want a fisheye for anything other than a cheap thing to play around with you should buy a real fisheye lens. The Canon fisheye is great for a full frame or film camera but Canon does not make a fisheye for the cropped sensor DSLR's. In that case the Tokina 11-17mm fisheye is a very good choice.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Why would you buy a great DSLR camera just to attach crap optics in front of it? Yes, it will work, but my experience with "add-ons" is that they increase chromatic abberation and distortion to an untolerable degree (the latter irrelevant to a fisheye). If you're going after a fisheye because you like the effect it creates, then most softwares can recreate the same bulging effect digitally.
d1fee41232bb81bff138e747ce6187bdaa	Well first of all...are you watching cable tv or satellite tv when this happens? Not all regular TV broadcasts are in Dolby surround sound. So you will only get stereo sound. It is aggravating because I will be watching something on TV then the next show comes on the it is only stereo and I lose my center channel sound.<br>  <br>  Second...I hope with your poor instructions that it at least got you to install the TV source (cable or satellite) to the surround sound system inputs. Then you ran the cable from surround box to TV. This is the proper setup for listening to your TV in surround if the channel is broadcast in surround.

9M8lEQDqaa	Overall, Super Smash Bros Brawl.<br>  <br>  The only thing Mario Kart is better at than Super Smash Bros Brawl is maybe the online play and even then at least you don't have to worry about hackers (unlike in Mario Kart). But overall Brawl is more fun and it doesn't get old as fast as Mario Kart Wii.<br>  <br>  Unless you're more of racing fan than a fighting fan.|`|iZvr42Wuaa	I personally think SSBB gets old after a while.

(This is the one I use for my boys) We are at a shopping Mall.

What I, and other will say on this thread should not sway him.|`|DxoodgOtaa	if you get kidnapped or get lost or left somewhere and need help or someone else needs help, a cell phone is the thing. you have it with you everywhere, and its always available if you need to call someone.<br>  <br>  also, its the only way you can text, and it helps your social life A LOT. but give him the first reason so you sound more serious.|`|v3bhi62Kaa	Just tell him you deserve it if you( like if you've being doing good at school bring that up) say that you would feel more comfortable if you had a cell phone because you could keep in contact with him anywhere you where and just in case you needed help. Tell him he would also feel more comfortable because he could check up on you( that one is a good one but then he might actually start checking up on you. Tell him it would be easier to keep in contact with you when you are out of the house and he wouldn't need to worry about you because he could call. Tell its best to have a cell phone to keep in constant contact and in case of an emergency. I really hope this helps. Hope ya get a cell phone! BEST OF LUCK|`|Upop6p6Aaa	they definitely come in handy during emergencies. if youre stuck on the freeway, there arent always call boxes near by. also, those call boxes sometimes dont work. its also better than fumbling around for change to use a payphone.|`|m4nKkFDUaa	If you get lost, you can be contacted<br>  if there's an emergency, you can be contacted.<br>  You can stay in touch with your friends and make social plans (so you won't become unhappy and unpopular :) )<br>  If you forget homework you can text a friend.<br>  There are more, I'm sure of it!|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	in case of an emergency is a really good one to say
887aKDITaa	You can buy new drives on ebay for about 40 bucks.  Buy one just like your hitachi 78k so you can trade circuit boards to keep your modded firmware.  Also, make sure you don't burn the games faster than 3x.  You will get errors if you burn too fast.|`|ORK02MiXaa	Well that's what you get for illegally downloading games from the internet. It is people like you who ruin the fun of gaming.

Yp7xykIZaa	did u download a free/illegal version of the game|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	It sounds like you're running Vista.<br>  <br>  If this is the case, you need to make sure the game has the required permissions. Additionally, make sure you are logged into an account on the machine that has the ability to install\uninstall things. If you aren't, have your folks log in, try to play online(and download the patches), then log back into your account, and the patches should be applied!|`|yCeySYEyaa	ok you have to do the update manual. i had the same problem. you go into the folder where you installed it. usually C:\\program files\microsoft games\halo. you go in and look for the application haloupdate. it has a icon that looks like the halo legendary symbol. double click on that and it will open a halo window and start the update. then you will see a black box. dont close that out. if it asks for your password put that in and let it finish. then you should have no problems playing the game then.

U5AAPfyoaa	If you call Apple they will say that it's impossible, but i know better lol I found this little trick online a few years ago when our computer was struck by lightning (don't ask) & our motherboard fried, so here is what you do:<br>  <br>  1. go to help & support (if you have windows. idk about any other OS) & type in something like "hidden files" the first one should say "show hidden files". click on it<br>  2. follow the instructions to show hidden files. after you've completed that, plug your ipod in. if your itunes is open, make sure it you don't select to earse the ipod! go to my computer, then click the name of your ipod & there should be a file on there that looks a little bit more faint than the others called ipod_control click it & there will be folders that says like F01, F02, etc etc copy those files where ever you want them because that's where all your music is<br>  3. move the files into itunes. you may have to put them in one-by-one, i'm not sure.<br>  <br>  that's all you have to do =D<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. some songs may not be in those folders, but probably 99% of them are there, so don't worry.|`|K5dPbay6aa	Connect the iPod to your PC.

It entertains with many people like the whole family or even just yourself. Also Wii ski is really fun because you can make ridiculous characters and dress them up in ridiculous ski gear. Thats a fun one. If you are into a game that will entertain you for a while try super mario sunshine its great. Thats a game where you will get addicted to for a while then after just pop it in once in a while. If your into more action i have no reccomendations, for the wii is not for any action gaming. But hope you enjoy!|`|GY5Ju4ehaa	If you are into the cooking thing, I would check out the famous cooking mama games, there are a lot and it is a great pass time and maybe you could learn a thing or two!!! If you like the racing games then you should get Mario Kart Wii since it is the best around especially with your family!!! Another great one to look at is probably Mario Party 8, which can help spend lots of time and quick time, since you can sort of play a board game that is awesome with mini games and different variety of places too!!! Also you can set the number of turns that you want which will tell you how long the game will last...anywhere from like 10-50 turns per person!!!!...I have also heard about Carnival Games, which is a whole lot of fun.... If your into guitar..there is also Guitar Hero and remember there is always more on gamestop.com or something like that under wii and categories!!!!!!

j5Apt8hWaa	Fez is right.<br>  <br>  Clear?  That has to do with the quality of the lens and perfect focus.  Pixel count is probably the least important quality of a camera.<br>  <br>  So, go into a cell phone store and test cameras with 1.3 and 2 mp sensors.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	2MP|`|1F6KJt0oaa	2 megapixels should be but it really depends on the optics.  In cell phones they generally aren't very good but there is some variation.  Also it depends on the mount and how clean the lens is.  Finally it depends on the settings.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	Definitely the 2mp. When you're that low in pixel count then 700,000 pixels can make a phenomenal difference. However when you're dealing with 10 or 12 mega pixels, there is hardly if at all any difference.|`|Srat0Dvraa	2 megapixels, but it also depends on other factors how clear the picture will come out.

pPyaUCLHaa	You could show them you really want it by offering to do chores you don't usually do. If they can afford it, they'll be more inclined to get it for you if they get something in return, and if you show them that it's not something you're going to get tired of in six months, because parents hate seeing $250 gather dust in the closet.<br>  <br>  You could help them pay for it by sitting down and talking about a loan (they pay for it in full now, but you have to find ways to pay for half of it over the next year or half year). When the amount they have to pay goes down, the likelihood of them getting it for you goes up. If you want it more than anything, you should be willing to work for it.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to work hard for it, you could point out that it's a DVD player, can stream movies from Netflix (this will really only work if they have or are considering getting Netflix), has some games that families can enjoy and is fairly inexpensive compared to a certain PlayStation 3.|`|4999d7adc142f277d9650c9fcdbb39cdaa	Tell them it's really cheap and it can also play DVDs.

MvhtwyXfaa	Get Fallout 3. Its a little pricey an no online but it provides hour upon hour of entertainment. <br>  <br>  "Fallout 3 takes place in the year 2277, 36 years after the setting of Fallout 2 and 200 years after the nuclear war that devastated the game's world in an alternate post-World War II timeline.[11] The game places the player in the role of an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect a small number of humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the player is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington D.C. to track him down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of other human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that now inhabit the wasteland. The game has an attribute and combat system typical of an action role-playing game but also incorporates elements of first-person shooter and survival horror games."|`|oJJmJTuaaa	Gears of War 1 and 2<br>  Halo 3<br>  Mass Effect<br>  Saints Row 1<br>  Ninja Giaden 2<br>  The Darkness<br>  Bully|`|flMNMS7Iaa	I reccomend a membership at a video rental place.

ikpJW3m0aa	i had an iPhone 3G, not a 2G. <br>  <br>  i would say the iPhone 2G would be better only if you already have ATT and you are willing to spend a good chunk of money more for the features it has. <br>  <br>  expect to pay $100 a month if you are used to spending $50 a month on phone service.<br>  <br>  but with that you get amazing functionality. you get more features just about all the time, but its not without its downfall.<br>  <br>  when i owned my iPhone 3G i found horrible reception and dropped calls in areas such as seattle, a big silicone center. <br>  <br>  personally i am looking at an iPod Touch to replace my iPhone now that i have made a seperation between the two... but remember you can only use the iPod touch to its full abilities when at home or in other free wifi spots... unlike the phone where you can do it pretty much whenever you want.<br>  <br>  <br>  also look into a Microsoft Zune thats what i use for a MP3 player, you get a lot more space for less money, and wifi. <br>  <br>  no touch screen though, which is a big loss in todays day and age.|`|DCnukMFhaa	I would get the iphone because it is the newer generation and <br>  comes with more stuff<br>  and i have the iphone without a sim card and its cool|`|XcOrkXeXaa	ipod touch is wayy better becuz all u do is downlaod this app and u can text and talk for FREE!! and the iphone u hav to pay a bill every month!|`|xFVjLpdYaa	iPod touch<br>  You may think the iPhone is cheap,<br>  but wait until you get the bill!<br>  Even if you hardly use it,<br>  you will still have a huge bill|`|HLbWpsjuaa	the iPhone costs more money to run so i would say iPod touch because if you get a free text app you can use it for free!!|`|3piD14gAaa	iPod Touch is overall cheaper because of the total internet bill even though you can get the internet on the iTouch if you have wireless internet.

qVYyw1ndaa	no, it has to be the same model. but you might be able to get a similar one if you've had problems with the phone before.
SIHg9sWHaa	No, not without paying off the remainder of the contract (which is a wast of money),,, or by simply not paying and getting a poor credit rating and possibly but unlikely taken to court.<br>  <br>  Unless your willing to try something extreme!!!<br>  <br>  You can get a relative to contact t mobile, and tell them that you died in a car acident or something and that the contract should be terminated imediatley as they are greiving and every letter they send is causing them more greif . Get them to pay of the remainder of that months bill for you, and then you should be out of the contract.<br>  <br>  That is the only way you will be able to get out off contract am afraid, but i have heard that it works and iv never heard off any come backs from it.<br>  <br>  The choice is yours m8|`|AA11256390	They do allow you to cancel the contract but it will cost you however many months you have left time by the monthly payment. You're basically paying for the rest of the contract length. This, unfortnuately when you're only a few months into a contract is rarely an option. I would suggest try calling them to see if you can downgrade the contract amount, you may only be able to do this so often but could maybe get it down by quite a margin.|`|erOKvXjHaa	need to pay out but is really expensive|`|Rp8HoqP6aa	Tell them u wish to emigrate|`|z88IMXNFaa	You can always cancel a contract but you will be charged a contract termination fee.

3CJAUyqPaa	Canon XH or Canon XL2? It depends if you want to do standard definition or high definition. Both are fine, pro-grade, camcorders.<br>  <br>  Which JVC miniDV tape based camcorder do you have in mind? Some can accept a 35mm adapter - most cannot. But the JVC GY pro series would be up there with the Canon XH or Canon XL2... As would be the Sony HVR pro series and Panasonic AG-HDX200 series...
ofpmRvHpaa	Yes you usually have to subscribe to a service so  you get nightly updates on the electronic program guide.  (This is the basis of the magic of a DVR - the guide.)<br>  <br>  You can usually only watch it from the box. The sat systems tend to store the bit-for-bit sat data so it's not any standard format that a computer can understand.<br>  <br>  But search for hacking the Tivo as it may have converters.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	While most cameras take video, and some camcorders take photos; to get the best of both, you need both. Have not seen a camera that compares with the video from a camcorder and camcorders can't take good quality photos.  Suggest the least expensive Canon Camcorder and the Canon A590IS camera.<br>  <br>  The number of pictures that memory will hold depends on the mega pixel setting on your camera. My camera will hold about 900 pictures with a 1 GB memory card and a setting of 3 mega pixels. It will take 84 minutes of video at 30 fps.  Could use a 5.2 mega pixel setting, but there would be no improvement in picture quality.<br>  <br>  Check the Memory Card Storage Table at this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.digitalphotographywebsite.com/memorycardstoragechart.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.digitalphotographywebsite.com...</a> ...<br>   <br>  Would choose a 3 MP setting unless you plan to print a photo larger than 8 x 10 inches.  You actually lose picture quality when you crop a higher MP photo down to a smaller size.  It also takes more money, memory space, processing, and transmission time with a higher setting.<br>   <br>  Most companies are touting high mega pixel to sell cameras, but high mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for large pictures or enlarging parts of pictures. Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches.  Megapixel resolution is about potential photo size, not picture quality.<br>  Click links below for more details. <br>  <a href="http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.jhtml?pq-path=398&pq-locale=en_US&_requestid=2039" rel="nofollow">http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j...</a> ... <br>  <a href="http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going_digital/#resolution" rel="nofollow">http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going...</a> ...<br>   <br>  The memory card I like, bought, and have tested is the Kodak 1GB for $10.88 at Walmart. Had liked SanDisk, but had trouble with two and these were a little more expensive so took them back.  Both seemed about the same speed, but PNY was really slow.  Don't like to put too many pictures on one card because something could go wrong and all pictures would be lost.  Also, different cards could be used for different subject areas.<br>  <br>  The best way to move pictures to and from a memory card and a computer is with a card reader.  If there are no memory card slots on your computer that work with your memory card, purchase a Targus card reader at Walmart for $8.88 or another brand for less at Ritz/Wolf/Kit camera.  Also, they do 3? x 5" digital prints for 6￠ each on Tuesday and Wednesday.<br>   <br>  CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged, format in camera, and don't delete or fill card completely.  Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select, then click Stop and OK.<br>   <br>  Click this link for other camera tips and complete instructions on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts. <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13701973093918363271" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/base/a/4210404/D13...</a>|`|FPJSoxYwaa	It all depends on the size of the memory. 4 gigs will get you hours of video but keep in mind that most digital camera's record video in very small sizes so try to find one that can record in larger sizes that will not stretch out when viewed on a television screen.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	It depends on what resolution the camera has also. You may find that you can record a lot of video with a 5 mega pixel camera but not so much with a 10. I have a 7mp and it can record around 45 minutes of video and sound with a 1gb card which is pretty long especially for a point and shoot camera.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Mike - If you are talking about DJ or PA system speakers it is not too difficult to match the speakers and amplifier.  Pick out the speakers you want and then get an amp that puts out around the same wattage as the speakers can handle.  You will need to know what wattage a given amp puts out at the same ohms that your speakers are.<br>  <br>  People make it way more complicated than it is.  An exact match is not necessary.|`|8zW0hk5Haa	Many stereo speaker companies (I'm assuming car audio) grossly inflate the amount of power (watts) their speakers handle or the amount of power their amps put out. Watts usually means peak power handling capacity, RMS usually means the amount of continuous power per channel the speaker will safely handle.Ohms are a measure of resistance in the electronic device, most car audio speakers work at 4 ohms. A 2 ohm speaker has half the resistance of a 4 ohm speaker and will effectively DOUBLE the power of your amp if it(the amp) can handle the extreme heat of operating at 2 ohms. Mono is one channel, stereo is twp channel operation. Mono is only good for bass applications i.e.your sub(s). Stereo operation gives you the full sound from your mids, mid-bass, and highs.Bridged refers to making a stereo amp operate in mono mode. Please spend your hard earned money on a name brand amp and speakers! If you cant pronounce it or it is deceptively similar to another name brand do waste your time or money. Buy from a reputable car audio specailist not the local big box store.

I will say a cover is a must. At least you can keep its good look and sell at a better price when you are upgrading to another new ebook reader in the future. As you know, the used Kindle 1 is still selling at over $200.|`|51eb8d219433fe817252e3456f4a680baa	The differences between the kindle and the kindle 2 are: Kindle 1 has bigger next and back page buttons, the cursor on kindle 1 is a wheel whereas on the kindle 2 there is a joystick. The design of the kindle 2 is flat and round whereas the kindle 1 is thick and jagged. The kindle 1 is selling for $240 on amazon whereas the kindle 2 is selling for $359. You have to buy the books from amazon for example like the new stephen king and dean koontz books which most new books sell for no more than $9.99 or you can download free non copyright books from gutenberg.com. There is also free books on amazon you can get for the kindle by putting "-domain" in the search bar in the kindle store category they pull up hundreds of free kindle books you can receive. Most new books can be bought for the kindle about a week after they are released. I am purchasing a cover when i order my kindle 2 that way it can stay in a protector when i'm not using it. The reason i didn't buy the kindle 1 was because i never buy first generation electronics i wait til they improve the product before i purchase.

b7dp2PlHaa	It may be an issue with your actual internet connection. A short somewhere, or something with actual wiring outside of your house. You should contact your internet provider and tell them you're having issues. If the issues are only on your 360 and nothing changed on your computer or any other game systems, I can't really tell you what might be wrong. But usually when something happens to a 360 it breaks completely. I'd bet that it's something with your router or outside of your house. Best bet is to call your isp.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|oJJmJTuaaa	There's an issue with your ISP.
IQ7bNFaKaa	The signal from the AV sender will be as good as the TV downstairs as the indoor aerial will not effect it, however, there are other things which could effect it.<br>  <br>  The quality of the signal is dependant on the distance from the sender to the receiver and thickness of the walls, the further away the more snowy it might be.<br>  <br>  Also any devices such as cordless phones, microwaves and anything which omits radio waves of the same frequency might cause interference.<br>  <br>  On the whole, the dearer the AV sender costs the better the signal quality.

If it is below 1/250th of a second (1/500th is better), raise the ISO setting on your camera until you can get fast shutter speeds.<br>  <br>  The rule is, it is better to have grainy or noisy shots, than getting blurry shots with lower ISO film or sensor settings to reduce grain or noise.<br>  <br>  You may want to mount some flash units above the court and use them.  If you can do that, you can set your camera to its highest flash sync and use a Pocket Wizard to fire the flashes (you will need something like a pair of Alien Bees with at least 200 watt/second heads.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Blur reduction has to do with shutter speed.  You'll need to shoot somewhere around 1/640.  Another thing to try to do is to track your subject, IOW, follow your subject while shooting.

I did this last week while shooting a division I college game.  The court appeared to have decent lighting but I was not getting the shutter speed I needed even at ISO 1600 and F2.8.  I wound up underexposing the shots but still freezing the action (well, most of it) and used PS to lighten the shots.|`|1jFG5h1iaa	This may sound stupid but the focus mode might be on the manual setting. Also if you have dropped the lens then you may have knocked something out of place. If this is the case then you might want to check your warranty. This can be extremely expensive to fix and may be cheaper just to buy a new lens. Good luck
ihYl3mJqaa	Generally the speakers are mediocre in construction very similar to what you might find in lower end speakers such as what you would find at Best Buy, etc.. <br>  <br>  Most of the problems come from the impedance matching of the speaker to an amp. Most are lower impedance and not very efficient. requiring a big amp to drive them properly. <br>  <br>  But most of these are paired with are underpowered amps. These also do not have DD decoders or modern type connections(HDMI even optical). <br>  <br>  Also why wouldn't you raise issue with a item that is so clearly inflated in value to prey on consumers? I suggest that what ever you plan on offering for the system, take that and go get a HTIB. Even the cheapest system will be much better than a out of a van system.

XOPvmV5Iaa	There's two main kinds, active and passive. The passive simply seals off the outside sound with some type of insulation completely covering the ears. <br>  <br>  Very simply, the active type actually "listen" to the ambient noise and then generate a noise that "cancels" the existing noise. Basically it generates a noise that is sort of opposite to the existing sound which tends blank the existing sound out. <br>  <br>  Prices range from $30 on up depending on quaility and type purchased.|`|OQwFQTdFaa	Sound proof headphones make it so that all you really hear is the music or movie or whatever your listening to.

Period.<br>  Now it gets pretty interesting when it comes to the PS2 games.<br>  There are many types of PS3's out there, but only two types are still in stores.<br>  <br>  I will sort them by GB.<br>  -20GB: Has 4 USB slots, and can play ALL PS2 games.<br>  -40GB: Has 2 USB slots, and CAN'T play PS2 games.<br>  -60GB: Known to be the best PS3. Pretty much because it has a lot of memory, and can play ALL PS2 games, and has 4 USB slots.<br>  <br>  Now it might get kind of confusing. Sony had made 2 different 80GB PS3's. Only one of them is on stores.<br>  <br>  The old 80GB (one that is NOT on stores right now): Has 4 USB slots, and it can play PS2 games, but not all of the PS2 games, so this one is kind of hard to rely on if you want it to play all of your PS2 games.<br>  <br>  The new 80GB (one that IS on stores right now): Has 2 USB slots, and can't play PS2 games.<br>  <br>  160GB: This one is not that great since people never find themselves needing that much memory, and it's expensive, and it can't play PS2 games. It also has 2 USB slots. It is on stores right now.<br>  <br>  So if you want a brand new PS3, you can only buy the new 80GB, and the 160GB. The others, however, you can still find on gamestop, which is a store (lol), but only used ones. You can also buy those on eBay, Amazon, and other places online. You can buy the ones that are not on stores online, and you might find them in a NEW condition, but it would be expensive.<br>  <br>  You might be thinking why the ones on stores are worse than the old ones, if new things are supposed to be better. The reason Sony took out the emulator (the thing that lets you play PS2 games) and the 2 additional USB slots, is because when the PS3's had all that, they were very expensive, and people just couldn't afford it, and Sony lost too much money. So they couldn't just drop the prices like that with leaving all that good stuff inside, so they took it out, so that it won't hurt them even more.|`|QriWp4fzaa	i got 80 gig ps3. it has 4 slots and plays ps3 games. call the store ur buyin it from and ask to be sure. it shuld have 4 slots. add me for ps3, sacred_elite|`|Q9saUFYqaa	Unless you find a used model, you can't.

If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.<br>  <br>  I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.<br>  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.<br>  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.<br>  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  my suggestion<br>  go to this link for help <br>  <a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-buying-guide/" rel="nofollow">http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...</a>|`|1jFG5h1iaa	If I were you and you want a DSLR then I would've already narrowed it down to a Nikon. Nikon has proved with the D40 that mega pixels aren't the only things that matter for picture quality. This is because the D40 only has 6 mega pixels. The D40x is the newer D40 with 4 more mega pixels built in. It's pretty much the same thing as the earlier D40 except for the pixel count. I have the D60 which I bought for less than $700 with a 18-55mm VR Nikkor lens. It takes breathtaking pictures but it is a little on the expensive side compared to the D40 (about $200 more). I would highly recommend that if you're going to be purchasing any of these cameras then make sure it's a it with an 18-55mm VR Nikkor lens and a zoom 55-200mm VR lens. If you only want to have one lens then you can purchase an 18-200mm VR lens for over $500 or you could get an 18-200mm lens for around $200 without Vibration Reduction. If you don't want a DSLR at all then I would highly recommend the Nikon Coolpix P80. It has an 18x optical zoom with image stabilization. This is a really nice camera and is a great deal. The only reason I don't like this camera is because it's a little large and too big to fit into your pocket. However if that' no problem for you then you might want this. Also if you want to get a excellent quality point and shoot camera then I would get a Samsung SL310w. I have this camera and the reason I got it is because Consumer Reports rated this camera EXCELLENT for image quality while no other point and shoot cameras were rated this high. It also has dual image stabilization. Good luck and I hope this helps you.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Can't go wrong with Pentax.  They have a wide range of economic DSLR cameras that actually give you more features for your money.  Also you can get lenses for next to nothing on the second hand market because their DSLRs are compatible with all their Kmount lenses at least to a certain degree.  The worst thing you loose is with K-m lenses you can't control the lens in camera.  If it is a shock that a manual lens can't be automatically controlled then don't get M lenses.  There are plenty of K mount lenses out there to do just about any thing you may ever want to do.  And they give you the most for your money.  <br>  <br>  Does your class want you to have a digital?  That seems odd to me.

FVDbVcnCaa	yeah i would get it, looks dope|`|kFBpec6saa	Yes, this TV is good enough for gaming on the 360.|`|b7dp2PlHaa	That would be a nice tv for 360 gaming, especially since it's native resolution is close to that of most 360 video game titles (720p). The response time is good, the contrast is really good, and it would also look great if you decided to run it at 1080i.<br>  <br>  good luck dude|`|HX6JjCTyaa	Yes,that is a good tv.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141AZCW?ie=UTF8&tag=computer0bd-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00141AZCW" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00141A...</a>
1jFG5h1iaa	Let's start with the brand of the lens. If your camera is a Canon then I highly recommend going with a lens that matches the brand of the body of the camera. Now let's look at the zoom. If you want a wide angle with very little zoom then try a 18-55mm VR (vibration reduction) lens. This is a very wide angle lens but you might want a little more of a zoom. Then you might want to try a 18-200mm lens. This is what I would get for my Nikon. Now this might get to be pretty expensive (around $300) so you might want to think about a Sigma. Here is one below.<a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/Sigma-18-200mm-EX-Optical-Stabilizer-Lens-Canon-Digital_W0QQitemZ180330930455QQcmdZViewItemQQptZCamera_Lenses?hash=item180330930455&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72:1234|66:2|65:12|39:1|240:1318|301:0|293:1|294:50" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/Sigma-18-200mm-EX-Op...</a><br>  <br>  Now this is around $300 and is for a Canon. I would recommend asking the seller if this will auto focus with your camera. I'm not sure if it has a motor in it. The motor is what will allow the camera to auto focus if the lens doesn't have a motor in it. And if you're thinking you can save a few bucks and just deal with manual focus, don't do it. It can be extremely hard to auto focus especially in low light situations. You want to be able to get the most out of your camera and I want you to also. Good Luck|`|fp9bOiVFaa	Best starting lens is the Canon EF-S 18-55mm IS. It will cover all your general photo shots. If you don't already have it you can find it for less than $150. If you already have it and want some reach in your shots, pick up the Canon EF-S 55-250mm for around $250. These lenses will get you started for a low price and with decent quality. Once you've shot for a while you'll know what to look for in your next lens.

HKKu4CjEaa	My wife and I found one for $10.00 at a yard sale, and I was able to "jew" the guy down to $7.00.  Now, here's the deal:  So far, I can send faxes with no problem, but receiving them is something I haven't been able to do.  I've had a woman trying to fax me some forms on one occasion, but I ended up having her send them to a local business in town where I could go and get them.  I mean, the fax machine looked good, and the man still had the box he bought it in, the manual for it, and the receipt which he stuck to it with tape.  But, I don't know if it's something I'm not doing right or what when it comes to receiving faxes.  But, we see all kinds of good shittt at yard sales, but you have to get on up on Saturday mornings and hit them EARLY around 7 AM or even earlier before the stuff ges picked all over.  I've found a leaf blower, a hedge trimmer, an air compressor, a jigsaw, an ice cream churn, and it all works fine.  Give it a try and you might get hooked on it like we have.

o6JCM59Faa	If you are referring to 3G on the iPhone 3G, it refers to 3G internet connection and not numbers of release model/phones. International Telecommunications Union (ITU) defined the third generation (3G) of mobile telephony standards – IMT-2000 – to facilitate growth, increase bandwidth, and support more diverse applications. For example, GSM could deliver not only voice, but also circuit-switched data at speeds up to 14.4 Kbps. To support mobile multimedia applications, 3G had to deliver packet-switched data with better spectral efficiency, at far greater speeds. The old iPhone uses 2G/EDGE and WiFi for internet connection while the iPhone 3G support 3G, EDGE and WiFi. 3G is way faster than 2G/EDGE in connection speed. EDGE bars are not the same as 3G bars. EDGE connections use one tower at a time, 3G can use multiple towers simultaneously. So, a 2-bar 3G connection may actually be 'better' than a 5-bar EDGE connection (and it's certainly faster).|`|KfeeV5nraa	no idea what u are asking edit<br>  <br>  HELP ME?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AshPa6wwoXPHnk2edzVHrZTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222184009AANIVCe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223142427AA62Duo&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aot3.dttfAQxI3rAGHryoG7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222202542AAkT84a">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  THANKS HELP GREATLY APPRECIATED|`|3mU9hRluaa	Is this meant to be a joke? Anyways... 3G means it uses 3G connection. It doesn't mean its the third generation iPhone. Its the second. But 3G means that it is capable of using 3G. It can still use EDGE like the original iPhone but it is capable of using 3G in areas that have 3G coverage. The software is identical to the original iPhone.|`|i7TTejCEaa	most probably something to do with the software<br>  <br>  for example... i have an ipod 5.5g.. it is exactly the same as a 6g but the actual software on it is different.. different icons, colours etc.<br>  <br>  its probably something so small in the difference, and these days everyone wants the latest thing... easy cash for apple :)|`|AA10965358	There is no 1G or 2G iphone.<br>  <br>  The first Iphone is actually 2.5G because it uses the EDGE network.<br>  <br>  The 3G Iphone uses UMTS, which is (essentially) the fastest current network available in the US.

j5Apt8hWaa	Yes, your D80 can only stand a trigger voltage of 12v or less.<br>  <br>  Some of the older Vivitar 283 and 285 flash units use trigger voltages from 12v to 600v depending upon when they were made or exact model number ... for instance the 285HV has a voltage of 12V. The 285 has a voltage of 350V.<br>  <br>  You should really call the Nikon help line 800.NIKON-UX and ask them for any information they have on Vivitar flash units.<br>  <br>  What can happen?  You can fry the electronics on your D80 .. no warranty coverage for that.|`|jje1mNJEaa	If it has some sort of proprietary bolting that may damage the hot shoe, then no. But if it just has a screwdown grip, then yes it will work.<br>  <br>  The new nikon flash, for example, the sb900 has a steel pin instead of screwdown grip to hold it place, thus making it incompatible with non-nikon cameras without a special adapter.

The iPod Shuffle would be okay too but there is no screen making it hard to go through songs.  But sometimes older people think that's easier.  LOL JK.

j5Apt8hWaa	The next lens will probably be the 55-200 mm.  It will be the one you can use for shooting your children in action, sports.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, spend a lot of time using your camera and learn more and more about it.|`|7SXA5dhDaa	Taking people pictures requires more than a good lens.  Rapport with the people is often key.  Having said that, a telephoto lens in the 85-100mm range is often used.  You want telephoto to keep from intimidating your subjects by being able to be back from them.  It also allows you to blur the background so that your subject stands out, and is not distracted with whatever is in front or behind them.<br>  <br>  Have fun with this.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	why kind of "different" pictures do you want to take? O_O If you enjoy taking portraits, the Nikkor 60mm micro is a great lens. It's f/2.8 aperpture means its fairly bright, and it also doubles up as a great macro lens. If you want to take pictures of something far away and can't move any closer, the Nikkor 70-300mm f/4.5-5.6 is quite a decent lens, if a little expensive. Opt for the cheaper Nikkor 55-200mm if you dont have the cash to spend. For wide angle options, I suggest ditching the Nikkor 12-24mm altogether in favour of the Tokina 11-16mm. Not only is build quality better, it has a wider reach, better sharpness, and at a price about the half of the nikkor's. <br>  <br>  If you want a walk-around lens to use anywhere, any time, consider the Nikkor 35mm f/1.8 or the 50mm f/1.4 Personally, I'd prefer a 50mm lens on a DX body, because not only it is faster (if only very slightly), it also doubles up as a useful half-body portrait lens. If you're willing to sacrifice pristine performance at all settings but would like a zoom, then consider the Nikkor 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6 It suffers from pronounced distortion and chromatic abberation. But both of those are easily correctable in software.

AbRfd29Haa	A year ago when I got my PS3, it was a no-brainer... it was easily the best Blu-Ray player out, it got regular software updates from Sony (important for either Blu-Ray or HD-DVD in the early days... bugs were common enough), and it was actually one of the cheapest ones around. <br>  <br>  I'm happy with mine, and while I'm not a super serious gamer, I did buy some games. I'd claim they're starting to get better looking than the X-Box 360 games... it's taken that long for programmers to figure out what to do with the weird but very powerful PS3 architecture (my son has a 360). <br>  <br>  I still think it's one of the best Blu-Ray players around; you'd have to go pretty high end to get the full features (BD 2.0 stuff like online, for what that's worth), and of course, it's a great general media player, handles WMV and DivX files, network video, etc (sure, the X-Box does that kind of stuff too). And the regular DVD upscaling is crazy... I didn't really believe any player would do it better than your normal HDTV does it, but the PS3 made me a believer, whatever magic it's doing, it works. <br>  <br>  If you're a serious gamer, you eventually need every console, anyway (my kids also have a Wii). If you're on the fence, check out the games you can't get on the X-Box, and maybe that's enough for you to make a decision.<br>  <br>  The only real thing against the PS3 vs. a dedicated Blu-Ray player -- the sucker gets HOT. It uses lots of power, and if you have it in an enclosed area, that might be a problem. On an open shelf, no big deal. Also, they're supposedly dropping the price $100 in April or thereabouts.. you might want to check into that.|`|d388tGGpaa	SIMPLE.....in my eyes ! ! ! !    just get a PS3 there fantastic,, they upscale the quality of normal films anyway and if you get a 60GB one they are backwards compatible with ps1 and ps2 games and it upscales the quality of them too,, im only 15 years old and might think im talking rubbish but i know what im talking about with ps3's>>> some may say that the 60GB has the best blue-ray player and that the otheres have the cheaper style ones,, but i dont know about that m8 ??? buy a PS3 !!! and when u do ,, go online and add me>> meza101 or meza_uk i have two,, hope this has helped and if u take my advice you will be a wise wise man ! ! ! !
