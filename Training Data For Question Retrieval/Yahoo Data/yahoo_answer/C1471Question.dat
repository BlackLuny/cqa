20090203114834AAgdWRu	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Why are witchcraft, ESP, + psi vampirism thought to be more far-fetched than other "invisable pink unicorns"?	Can you prove the existence of God or souls?      Can one rationally say that one God concept or afterlife concept is correct, while others are false?      Does it matter how many people believe in something, whether that thing is real or not?      Is it more rational to believe one's own experiences or believe what others tell you?      Can you prove Christianity (for instance) is not a mass delusion reinforced by other Christians?      If millions of people believe acupuncture works, are they all experiencing a placebo effect?      If something is unproven by Science, does this mean it doesn't exist?      Please, no answers saying anything and everything is possible. I'm looking for rational debate here, not mindless sheep.

20090203120038AA1UC4a	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What should i do about all this?	Im engaged to an amazing NYPD man. He is so caring and treats me wonderful plus he is so gorgeous ha. He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed apparently on the job also. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same,They are very comfortable money wise and are so stuck up im not like them at all. They tell me i could do so much better but i absolutely love him. I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ended up putting his fist through the wall. He snapped at me the other night during sex, again i just walked away. We don't fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him. I was also engaged to a guy 3 years ago but he slept with someone else. He is now back around my friends and tells me he wants me back & says i mean the world to him.I use to love this man but he broke me. My family also really liked this guy. Please help?

20090203120941AAAdZEj	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Question re:labourers, your opinion please?	Repost (originally posted in wrong catagory)      I have recently had the need to consider employing an additional labourer on my estate. My Personal Assistant takes care of the interviews and then puts forward a recommendation to me for approval.       The vacancy is a trivial one and requires no skills or educational qualifications. It is basically an odd job man (for want of a better description) to carry out duties like cleaning the steps, polishing the gates and brushing the stripes into the lawns etc.      My PA has put forward an applicant to me for consideration who cannot read or write (this is of no consequence). He (my PA) tells me that the applicant is currently in the service of a noble gentleman whom I know very well – I shall refer to him simply as ‘R’ for obvious reasons. The applicant has told my PA that his services are currently being provided without remuneration and that he is happy with being given accommodation and food – although he claims that the accommodation amounts to no more than permission to sleep in one of the cow sheds.       He continues to say that the reason he is seeking alternate employment is because ‘R’ is a prankster (I know this to be true) and he is tiring of the continual japes carried out on him by ‘R’ (many of which leave him injured him in some way). He claims that the last jape involved him becoming a projectile having been shot by cannon as they do in a circus act. ‘R’ had insisted that it was safe but then went on to charge the cannon with four times the amount of gunpowder as that used in the circus novelty act.      Now, I don’t mind the man being illiterate or malodorous, (he won’t be allowed in the house) but I really don’t think there is room in my organisation for someone who has no sense of humour.      Would you agree that a sense of humour is imperative in today’s workplace?

20090203120414AA0Af0j	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Im a nerd how can I be more social or active?	Are there bars or anything where I can just kind of be there without really being there? Like in the background and still fit in and be comfortable?       I have to spend all my time alone so what are some things I can do to stay active, stay healthy, and stay in reality but by myself? I have sort of just confined myself to my house and drifted out of reality with movies and video games, but it really messes with my head. I feel like killing myself. With the question about bars and such, I like to drink but I dont want to just drink in a dark house by myself or something so I though maybe it would help me be at ease grabbing a drink by myself and being out in public.       Or what about sport or some sort of athletic activity can I do by myself and really get enjoyment out of besides running walking or riding a bike something that will keep my brain working. I know I am all over the place, but I cant just sit around doing homework and playing video games and masturbating all the time :x       I know I am lame, but I don't think I have to really deal with rejection or feel like I should just off myself because society doesn't accept me for who I am.      I also, like most people, don't have a ton of money to just go out and spend all the time either so I have to find some way to structure my days in a constructive way that will keep me in touch with reality, and sane but will be good for me and help me feel productive.          Again, society doesn't accept me, and I am who I am so I cant change that fact. So telling me go out and make friends or some bs like that is counterproductive and rather pointless and really insulting, so keep it to your self.      There are some things I want to do like save up for a solo trip to Cabo or Cancun one spring break. And I really want to go skydiving, and I have always wanted to try snowboarding and skateboarding, and I work on my mustang quite a bit but I don't always have money for parts so its a process. And there are concerts, or things like beer festivals or whatever here in CO that I go to but I feel like my life is miserable and pointless and I want to enjoy some things before I really do want to off myself x_X

But yeah the clerk was a total weirdo and was acting all slow and stuff. He also seemed to be scared to death of me lol. I know i was all hooded up in my coat bc it`s cold outside and since it`s the middle of the night, i didn`t take time to do my hair. So i was just trying to spare his eyes from my messy appearance. I guess my appearance frightened him instead or something. Whatever his problem is, it was a really uneasy, creepy feeling. Eating my snacks, i`m uncomfortable and haven`t stopped thinking about it yet. So i guess i need to get it off my chest and to not go there late at night again. I wanted to wait till early morning but damn, i really wanted my snacks! I`m watching movies all night. What`s the point of having a 24hr convenience store nearby your house when you can`t use it?

Why do our kids have to learn to be diverse in a way where they recognize differences? See, i have no problem with cultural diversity, But i'm just wondering why it is that everything has to be so recognized, and focused on. if we are truely equal, would we focus on eachother on purpose? if we americans, are truely unbiased why is it that in most cases a minority is given special rights over a white man? A white man works just as hard, and every other white guy you see doesnt have money falling out of his wallet. Id like to see this giant sprawl of mansions where white people live in complete happiness. It doesnt exist(Dont even try to say california.), so anyone tell me, why is it that white people go crazy over minorities, when the message they preach is to just not care, but if that was the case why are they doing it?

20090221034543AAamDfJ	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Is there any clear dividing line between magic, voodoo and what people call prayer? How should we be praying?	If one believes in prayer, can't it be used for both good and evil?      Some studies have shown that we can increase the healthiness of bacterial cultures, increase the healing of wounds in animals, germination rate of seeds [through positive intention]. Or one can produce the opposite effects in all the same instances [through negative intention].      A Spiritualist from England once said, "There is no essential difference between sticking pins into a wax image of an enemy and burning candles before a wax image of the Virgin Mary."      Prayer is wrapped up with a sense of ritual, our sense of sacredness, our sense of connection with a higher power. But so too is magic. Most people who do magic believe that they are appealing to a higher power.  The connection between prayer and ritual and magic as intention. It's the thought, the wish, the desire behind the act.      Isn't it easy to slip into using prayer to cover up your own hidden agenda for good or evil?

They watch everything I do and are always concerned about me, and very invasive, my parents are way too overprotective. I want to go on a trip to Europe with a couple of girlfriends during spring break and they said outright that I couldn't go because I'm too frail and that they're much too worried about me. I often feel very angry at them and even feel that I dislike them. They also dislike my friends for no reason, except for the fact that they are not religious Jews and they think they're a bad influence....I have siblings but they're extremely protective with me compared to them because I have Cystic Fibrosis and I've often been quite ill, but I am responsible enough to do the treatments I need daily myself or with the help of my friends and take all the medications at the right times myself if I went on the trip. I feel like they treat me like a baby and never trust me enough to do anything at all on my own and I'm 17.       How can I get them to agree to let me go on the trip? And how can I get them to quit being so watchful and protective of me?

20090221040426AAdnhdO	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists are going to love this question and Christians not.?	But is not almighty?      How about that?      I spent some time thinking on this and I came to the conclusion that there is absolutely no reason for god to be almighty at all. All he has to be is someone who made the earth and humanity, and that's it. Something else entirely could be responsible for the creation of the universe.      What if god is simply like our fathers? You know when we were kids, how we looked up to our fathers as beings who could do everything and anything. Problem at school? No matter, dad would take care of it. Having problem with your grades? No problem, dad can help you out with math. Bad at sports? Dad will jump in and give you some pointers. Wanted that one toy real bad? Dad always had the money to buy it, and even if he didn't, the reasons he gave for not wanting you to have it always were the right ones.      Dad was always there as an all-purpose safety net. And while he was responsible for the creation of not just me, it also felt as if he was responsible for everything around me to some degree. He could right all the wrongs and make everything come together and work out.      Of course, then you grow up. You grow up and you realise that, well.. your father is just a guy. Sure, you love him and cherish him because hey, he's your father. But he's still just another human being like everyone else, and there are significant limits to what he can do.      What if that is simply the same thing with god? Because we know absolutely nothing about the nature of existence, or what happens outside our own measurable realm of the universe, it is easy to grossly overestimate the capacity of god.      Assuming he exists, what if he's really just nothing more than a higher being who made us and the earth, the solar system at most, and just left it at that. What if, when it comes to god, we simply haven't grown up yet?      Would that not make a lot more sense?
20090221040019AAXIxQu	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What happened that made the USA so fanatically christian?	I was browsing through some quotes of famous atheists and it surprised me how many American presidents from the late 18th and early to mid-19th century appeared. Now while they might not all have been atheists, they did say some things that were definitely -not- in christianity's favour. It makes one wonder what happened to the US.      "The Bible is not my book nor Christianity my profession. I could never give assent to the long, complicated statements of Christian dogma."   -- Abraham Lincoln      "I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absenteed myself from Christian assemblies."   -- Benjamin Franklin      "Lighthouses are more helpful than churches."   -- Benjamin Franklin      "What influence in fact have Christian ecclesiastical establishments had on civil society? In many instances they have been upholding the thrones of political tyranny. In no instance have they been seen as the guardians of the liberties of the people. Rulers who wished to subvert the public liberty have found in the clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy."   -- James Madison      "During almost fifteen centuries has the legal establishment of Christianity been on trial. What has been its fruits? More or less, in all places, pride and indolence in the clergy; ignorance and servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry, and persecution."   -- James Madison      "The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity."   "This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it."   -- both from John Adams      "The Christian god can easily be pictured as virtually the same god as the many ancient gods of past civilizations. The Christian god is a three headed monster; cruel, vengeful and capricious. If one wishes to know more of this raging, three headed beast-like god, one only needs to look at the caliber of people who say they serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites."   -- Thomas Jefferson      "Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man."   -- Thomas Jefferson      "I do not believe in the divinity of Christ, and there are many other of the postulates of the orthodox creed to which I cannot subscribe."   -- William Howard Taft      So what happened? What has happened that would've lead to this current situation:      “No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered as patriots. This is one nation under God.”   -- George Bush      Sarah Palin would never have made it so big during the 19th century. But she did make it big during the time of George Bush.      Ron Reagan Jr, an atheist, responded to a question if he would ever attempt to run for president with "No, I wouldn't. I'm an atheist. There is no way that the american people would ever vote for someone who's openly atheistic." And he is right. America is currently a country where you can openly say that you would never vote for an atheist, and not only would you -not- be considered a bigot, the majority would actually agree with you.

I grabbed my chest and fell to the floor, and she gave me mouth to mouth but it wasn't working. She also told me my grandma was there yelling, "She's gonna die! She's gonna die before her sister!"

Also, i went to a female strippers club (dont ask how i ended up there) and felt no attraction to any of the women there... not even remotely..really wishing there were some men instead lol.   so my question is (sorry i drag on too much).. do any other women experience the same thing?? is it that these women are so hot that they can turn on any woman or that im probably bisexual??

There is a certain someone that… let's just say that I don't want to receive mail from this certain someone. I'm pretty sure that she had my address at one point. Is it permissible for me to mark “not at this address” on the envelope? If I do, will the Postal Service stop sending other mail that's addressed to me because they think that I'm no longer at that address? If the Postal Service finds out, will I be in trouble for wasting their resources by requiring them to send the letter back?

20090221051043AAZBeL4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Could Jesus steal the prophecies from gita?	I've been reading few prophecies from gita & saw that they came true. So I was thinking if Jesus really stole them or not? I mean according to those, the unrighteouss is increasing & righteouss is decreasing. So is there any chance that Jesus could copy the prophecies? I'm just asking.       "In the Kali Yuga, wealth alone will be the deciding factor of nobility [in place of birth, righteous behavior or merit]. And brute force will be the only standard or deciding what is righteous or just."       "Mutual liking [and not family pedigree, social status, etc.] will be the deciding factor in choosing a partner in marriage; cheating will be the order of the day in business relations; satisfaction of sexual pleasure will be the only consideration of male or female excellence and worthiness; and the wearing of the sacred thread (Yajnopavita) [and not pious behavior or Vedic or Shastric learning] will be the outward index of being a Brahmin.       In the Kali Yuga, only one quarter of each of the four feet of Dharma [panance, truthfulness, compassion and charity] remains. And that too goes on decreasing day by day while the feet of Adharma [unrighteousness] increase greatly. So that in the end Dharma becomes extinct."       "In that [Kali] age, people will be greedy. They will take to wicked behavior. They will be merciless, indulge in hostilities without any cause, unfortunate, extremely covetous for wealth and women. High social status will be attained by Sudras, fisherman and such other classes..."       "When deceit, falsehood, lethargy, sleepiness, violence, despondency. grief, delusion, fear, and poverty prevail, that is the Kali Yuga..."       "...mortal beings will become dull-wittwd, unlucky, voracious, destitute of wealth yet voloptuous, and women, wanton and unchaste.       Countries will be laid waste by robbers and vagabonds; the Vedas will be condemned heretics; kings will exploit their subjects, and twice-borns like Brahmanas will only think of the gratification of their sexual desires and other appetites.       "Celibates [of the Brahma Carya ashrama] will cease to observe their vows of study, purity and celibacy; householders will take to begging [instead of giving alms]; hermits [of the vanaprastha ashrama] will resort to villages [leaving their retreats in the forests]; and Sannyasins will be extremely greedy for money.[in short, the whole system of the Varnashrama Dharma will have broken down.]"       "Petty - minded people will conduct business transactions and merchants will be dishonest."       In the Kali Yuga, men will abandon their parents, brothers, friends, and relatives. They will occupy high seats [and pulpits] and will [pretend to] preach religion.       People will have their minds weighed down with constant anxiety and fear. This will be due to devastating famines and heavy taxation. The land will not grow food-crops, and the people will always be in fear of impending droughts.      Don't these prophecies sound familiar to the prophecies of Christ?

20090221052919AAiw6rn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Do you think it's true that it's harder for honest, sincere people to be in a romantic relationship?	I'm posting this in the R&S section because I want to here from more people, and the Dating section doesn't have that many people in it.       But thanks to kingson and Cecillia, your answers were really good, especially Cecillia. I like your close observation and honesty. You'll get best answer there.      I've noticed alot in life, and even in movies, that an honest, really good hearted person is less likely to get a romantic partner than someone who isn't that good. Of course, good people get into relationships, I'm not saying everyone in a relationship is bad or anything like that. People are usually attracted to another person who is unpredictable, etc, which isn't bad at all. Being in a relationship with a very predictable person can be boring, or some consider it nice. But do you think, considering that honest, quiet people don't get as many chances for a romantic relationship as those who aren't that honest etc, is fair?       This question is out of pure curiosity and personal experience, I'm just looking for opinions, or facts if there are any? What do you think?      Thanks.

20090220223649AAPKGmP	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	LGBT: I just got diagnosed with a severe case of Brokenheart syndrome or lovesickness?	So you see I googled everything I could to explain why was getting so sick and it kept coming back to the same thing, a broken heart. I thought... ******* bullshit, thats not a real cause of anything...      But as it turns out, my psychologist says its not a joke or poetic word. It's a real mental illness that can cause severe health problems as it is doing already. Apparently my great aunty died of it when her husband passed away...      Mental Symptoms -   # Mania: I have extreme highs when nothing can get me down, not even the worst things in the world   # Depression: I cry everynight almost now   # Insomnia: I don't sleep to well and constantly wake up in the middle of the night, and I can't sleep at all unless Teddy is in my arms   # Loss of concentration: I fade in and out in TAFE classes doing a thousand yard stare which apparently is another symptom   # OCD: I must be wearing my necklace and bracelet that Josh gave to me otherwise I break down completely. When my teacher took the bracelet off me I had a small anxiety attack.   # Suicidal thoughts (in extreme cases): Yes I have had them, but they pass very quickly with my drugs. Like I think of the option but it doesn't interest me.   # The thousand-yard stare: Already said I have them.   # A feeling of complete emptiness: Like theres nothing really to life at all... its just a boring ride... but I use to have those feelings long before I met Josh.      Physical Symptoms -   # Upset stomach: I started crying last night at Youth Group and ran to the bathroom to throw up   Change in appetite: When this all first started I didn't eat for 4 days straight and still barely eat now   # Dizziness and confusion: That time I ran all the way to my friends house. The confusion was when I couldn't remember a thing of where I was or what happened.   # Comatose: When I reached my friends house and couldn't say anything but Josh's name.   # A perceived tightness of the chest, similar to an anxiety attack: I find that when I have an anxiety attack I can't breath and begin to pant. Like when my teacher took my bracelet off me.   # Anger: When my mother brought his name up in the car and I screamed at her not to mention his name   # Nostalgia   # Apathy (loss of interest): I was playing a game the other week at Inspire when I just completely lost interest and sat out, it happens even at TAFE while we are doing something or talking about something really interesting I just give up and don't put much effort to it anymore.   # Feelings of loneliness: I feel it all the time and surround myself with friends to put that feeling off.   # Loss of self-respect and/or self-esteem: I've lost great respect for myself, I said and I promised him I would help him. But I haven't... That's something I worry about frequantly      # In extreme cases, death: No, that hasn't happened... lol      My doctor said that I'm pushing the boundary to being hospitalized, he's looking at another drug for me to go on seeing as thought my anti-depressants are only doing half the job.   I never thought Love Sick was actually a real thing, let alone deadly...   So tell me...      Ever heard of something like this or no someone whose been through this... I couldn't help but laugh even when my doctor said it was no laughing matter and I'm a severe case... lol, no I know why they say love kills...

Why not mine your own business, take care of number 1, and keep out of trouble? God is in full control and allows people to do what he permits them to do. So why not do what you want but be in line with God and if you want help people? I am not going to enter the Kingdom of God by being good so why try being good. However, I will be condemned to hell by doing evil works. So I shouldn't brake the law or do immoral things. What do you think?

20090221024956AAXbWVs	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is the UK too soft on its criminals...is this why crime is now rife in this country...should we go back to 50s?	Ask yourself this...."Why are there more stabbings and killings in one WEEK now than there were in one YEAR in the 40s and 50s?" The answer is simple....killers were executed then, stabbers were given lengthy sentences in drab, austere prisons. Nowadays they are given a (shortened) stint in one of HM's holiday camps (er, sorry, prisons) with state of the art gymnasia (which many a leisure centre would be proud of), flat screen TVs, DVDs, computers etc. A stint in jail now is not something a criminal quakes in his boots about. People serving a 4 year sentence are out in 2...why?? Even murderers (who, as the 'human rights' lot have banned hanging) are not serving a 'life' sentence....they are even debating whether to let Stephen Sutcliffe, the Yorkshire Ripper, who brutally murdered so many innocent girls, out early.   There is no deterrent....so criminals carry on carrying knives, stabbing people for looking at then the 'wrong' way and murdering people. We all know what the solution is but this government (ruled by Brussels) won't even let us have a referendum on the matter...I wonder why.

20090221020415AAaENrn	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I ask them to stop, or hint at something better?	My friends buy me things that I hate. I don't tell them I hate it, because sometimes it's expensive stuff. I don't want to seem ungrateful, but at the same time I don't wan them to waste their money on these things that I never use/wear.      Example #1: For christmas, my friends bought me merchandise from my all-time favorite band. The thing is, the only band shirts I wear are from local bands. I don't like wearing popular band merchandise. It makes me feel like a poser. It's not a big deal, but they bought me t-shirts and hoodies that I never wear and are basically brand new in my closet. (also, for my birthday 2 years prior they bought me merchandise from the same band that I never wore and ended up giving to good will.)      Example #2: My friend bought me a knock-off Fendi purse while in NY. It's UGLY. I never use it, but I feel bad because she spent the money on it and was very excited to give it to me.      Now my friends ask me why I never use/wear these gifts that I expressed joy over receiving, and I have no answer.      How do I tell them to stop buying me these things without hurting their feelings?

20090220224731AAZ1eQ3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Am I a bad person...?	I was having a conversation with my parents the other night about religion I don't even know how it came up but I basically told them I am agnostic and this seemed to upset my mother a great deal.  I was raised Catholic my whole life (I'm 20 now) and I can honestly say I don't want anything to do with the religion.  I feel it is too strict and also in my church there were cliques!  It was crazy how unaccepting these "Christian" people were of others.  In my mind religion was created to answer questions that had no better explanation and I find it crazy the amount of bloodshed that has been caused by religion.  I also can't stand these priests on television preaching the word of the Lord while making millions of dollars.  It's not that I don't believe in God, because I do believe in a higher power.  It doesn't seem possible that this universe could exist without something setting it in motion.  But is the fact that I choose not to follow a certain religion all that terrible as my mother made it seem?  Am I a bad person for trying to think for myself?  I guess I'm just really confused and needed to vent.

I just wanted to know what does it mean to have a vampire dream or werewolf dream. the first was me feeling like I was being followed by a vampire while I was on a roadtrip,but I couldn't see him until I was in trouble. I somehow fell in a river somehow in the forest(no it's not like twilight) and saw his face when he saved me,but I was knocked out. the other night I had a second dream I went somewhere and saw this guy dressed in a dark grey cape with half a white mask on cover half his face and his eyes were burning red. he kept me in this glass case until sundown when he decided to show me to his people. all of a sudden this vampiric person in all black swong at him and I was standing right by him. they fell through a glass window and I was watching them from above. the person in black was like the hero called upon by some queen that was caring for me and the one in gray was the evil one that kindnapped me for power. the third dream on another night was strange,I was outside at night in a forest area again and was taken by these gothic people and chained to a wall. they were going to use my energy to give them power because my energy was pure while thiers were dark. I was looking at this other girl the was chained on a wooden bed screeming. somehow the vampire came in and unchained us and carried me somewhere before they stole my energy. he kept me in a serect place and didn't let me go until three days later. does that mean anything with these dreams?

We are in good company because Australia made it clear, decades ago, that they hate God. So, now that all is clear, to wit: God Hates Australia and Australia Hates God, let us speak to the fact that God is causing fires in one part of Australia killing hundreds. Then in another part of Australia God is sending floods. That is called MOCKING people. Then these insincere, violent, feces-eating brutes call themselves having a "Australia National Day of Mourning".Here's the only thing you freaks from "down under" bringing to pass these words: Ezekiel 7:27 The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled: I will do unto them after their way, and according to their deserts will I judge them; and they shall know that I am the LORD. Matthew 24:30 And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. The Lord God will be coming shortly, so Prepare to Meet Thy God Australia. AMEN!       Lets send these inbreds back to the US in traction and shove their picket signs where the sun dont shine.

20090221003515AASQ5Gw	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why people are so inhuman?	Why people are so inhuman they dont even help a person who is dying in a road accident?   If you want to join and fight against for this social cause then pls visit and link yourself    http://www.orkut.co.in/Main#Community.as...    I as a mother of AAKASH MAIDWAL request you all that Let us all pledge today that we will extend our help to all those people who have unfortunately met with a road accident and need our help.....   I pledge that I will help any such person that I come across in any which way I can.... I will not let anyone loose his/her life just because they did not get medical help at the right time.... I pledge to bring back humanity on the roads.....    It happened with my only son aakash maindwal, just 25 yrs and about to get married this month. He was coming back from his office when this accident took place. If any one had taken action in time his life could have been saved and I would have had my son with me today. I dont want that it should happen with any one else in this world. It is an appeal of a mother, that we all should fight against inhumanity. When this accident occurred, there were ten to fifteen employees of TELCO present in the bus that hit my son’s car and no one had courage to call the police and help them as my son was driving a car and that bus from which accident occurred were bringing the employees of Telco after the duty. They didn’t even bother about the victims and ran away. This is such inhuman behavior that the victim is left to die and no one has any compassion to help. Also when the person who rushed my son to the hospital reached the spot the Police and the ambulance were standing there just watching…. Can you believe this…??????   See how inhuman they were.   This accident occurred in Lucknow and Im sure many such accidents happen everywhere in India   My question to all : “Why we dont have courage and decency to help the victims of road accidents. He was my only child. Due to negligence of the inhuman people he lost his life.”

20090221020411AASwp1i	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	What is the name of this story?	I was told a story once in philosophy class about a man named Oslo or Zozo or something strange.

He continues reading on and finds in Chapter 47 that at the age of 47 he will die in a plane crash. The day comes and he finds himself on a plane. Absolutely terrified of crashing, he yanks the controls from the pilot, causing the plane to crash.       It's a familiar concept, pretty similar to Oedipus Rex. However, I can't find a retelling of that story anywhere. Has anyone ever heard this story before, and can you provide me with a link to some info on it? Thanks a bunch!

20090221023903AAib30R	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Can we put this tall tail to bed now?	Darwin, Charles (1809-1882)    "I am not the least afraid to die."    Charles Darwin's study of the diversity of animal species led him to conclude that living things evolve from a process of natural selection.  In 1859, following the publication of his book, On the Origin of Species, he and his work were attacked by religious fundamentalists who realized the British naturalist's theory dealt a fatal blow to the Christian belief in literal biblical creation.  Twelve years later, when he published The Descent of Man and applied his theory to humans, the assault intensified. In 1882,  Darwin died peacefully in bed after speaking with his son.    In 1985, Jimmy Swaggart, an American televangelist, told his enthralled listeners that Darwin had a change of heart on his deathbed, renounced his scientific works, and asked for a Bible so that he could learn to love Jesus.  Apparently this tale stems from a lie told by the wife of Admiral of the Fleet Sir James Hope to seminary students in 1882.  She claimed that she was with Darwin at the end and that he professed "How I wish I had not expressed my theory of evolution as I have done!"  Further, she added that he begged her to gather an audience so he could "speak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation. . . ."  Darwin's daughter soon debunked this fabrication, reporting that "Lady Hope was not present during his last illness, or any illness.  I believe he never even saw her, but in any case she had no influence over him in any department of thought or belief.  He never recanted any of his scientific views, either then or earlier. . . .  The whole story has no foundation whatever."

And if You are a Theist, for one week, for one week, You could not accept gods or their existence, you simply lacked the ability to believe in gods, and were baffled by how some people could believe such nonsense? What would you do?         What would you do if you realized that you were wrong, and they were right, if you could see the world through their eyes?            Personally As an Atheist, If I had a Religious Experience, I would become an Agnostic, and begin to seek answered in the mystic revelations of the past, but I would put logic and reason to these revelations and possibly come out with something new altogether.

The get preferential treatment for jobs (otherwise we are seen as racists) and they even want us to change our laws to suit the laws from their country.

20090221045404AAIig5H	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some people call catholicism a cult?	I'm not ranting because I am not catholic, haven't been for about 8 yrs now.  One of my former friends tried to say that catholicism was a cult, but she's baptist and baptist came after catholicism.  That being said, would anything protestant be considered a cult?  I know, I know a lot of you are going to say that all religions are cult and yes by definiton they are, but that being said do you see my point?  If a group of people break off from the main belief and want to have nothing to do with them, isn't that considered a cult.  I know I might be wrong, so it is ok if you prove it that way to me, with real facts.   :)      Note: mind you this the same woman(my former friend) that tried to say buddhism wasn't older than christianity. So I have some doubts about her intelligence altogether.

In NHS we had to fill out a list of 10 extra-curriculars -- will it make a bad impression on the admission officers (for the summer program) that I say "see attached NHS application"?

I don't see what they have done to make them famous. their music is weak and they are pretty much just a boring pop music factory chugging out mediocre songs and somehow reaching number one because they have good PR working for them.

20090221034256AAA3oiP	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Why don't demons get a life (or a brain?)?	seriously. I mean how bored to you have to be to go around possessing people and dicking around with the same little girl (or whoever) for hours and hours even days and days on end. I mean, jesus christ, wouldn't that get old? If they were truly evil, and wanted to maximize suffering in the world, why do they waste time doing this? I assume they have the power to cause great suffering and pain in the world. Why don't they simply just do this? If I were a demon, and I were greatly evil with strong powers, I sure would. I would make entire families feel the worst pain they could possibly feel for as long as I could. Also, I would calculate the length of time for each family and then go family hopping in order to maximize the pain in the world. Do they not have the power to do this or what? Or are they just really dumb?      This question was inspired by thinking of the movie Exorcism of Emily Rose. I remember when she was in the barn, there were six demons in her or something like that, and they were saying "I was the one within Cain! I was the one within Nero! blah blah blah. I am satan in the flesh!"      ok...why do they need six different demons to possess one girl? Shouldn't the others at least be inside other people? Also, they claim to possess important people, who had great effects on others, for example, the deranged Roman emperor Nero. However, what's ironic is that they were in all these historical figures, and then now they're in some random hick girl's body, who nobody cares about, out in the middle of no where. Demons are sooo smart.       and last but not least. cmon. what was the point of this really?..>>>  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7D7mXndgi...

Thanks.      Every summer i go to northern spain with my family however last year i went with my best friend. All my family live in spain so for this reason we do not have to stay at a hotel which is great because it saves alot of money. Last year my we stayed at my grandparents apartment, it is  quite big and it has beautiful views of the town. Because the weather was very hot, we were able to go to the outdoor pool where we were able to sunbathe, swim, play tennis. Afterwards, we would usually go into town for some lunch. The restaurants are wonderful there, i love Spanish food. When we finished lunch we had a look round the town. I really enjoyed this because i am very interested in history and they town had many beautiful old buildings and monuments. There was also a museum which was very interesting. In the evening we were quite tired however this did not stop us going out to the 'fiestas'. This was the highlight of the whole holiday. There were so many different people from different parts of spain that we spoke to. There were stalls with beautiful clothes and open air concerts with traditional music. We went for a drink in the bars and stayed up all night! I had a great time with my friend however next year i would like to visit some other places in spain because i love travelling.

20090221040150AAQOKXy	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Religious people and people who are interested in my question, could you please check this?	Why is it that:      ... it's ok to ridicule scientologists and jedi.   But it's expected to respect abrahamic faiths.      ... it's ok to pity North Korean children who sing songs of praise to their divine leader Kim Jong Il, who they get told is a god from the day they are born.   But it's expected to find children in church choirs singing christian songs about crusades and lepers perfectly normal.      ... it's looked upon as childish and somewhat silly to take moral lessons from recent works of fiction.   But it's expected to find it completely normal when the same lessons are taken from "holy" books over a thousand years old.      ... it's alright to be opposed to all sorts of political doctrine.   But it's not alright to be opposed to religious doctrine under the banner of respect.      ... we look at a guy standing on the streetcorner in robes and a silly hat claiming to be the personal representative of god and think he's a crazy fool.   But don't think the same of the Pope, who our leaders still visit every now and then for praise, council or advice.      ... we claim to have seperated church and state.   But don't elect atheists to high office.      ... we as a species pride ourselves on our progression from cavemen to civilised societies and look for advancement in all things.   Yet still worship the same gods today as we did fifteenhundred years ago, if not further.      Why is it that we still give any sort of credibility to religion at all? Because of an ancient status quo that would be politically incorrect to break. That is why.

I was reading through some of the questions last night before before bed, and one of them pertained to the civil war. Well, I thought that was all finished up, done and over with, but apparently not. Now, my family, who arrived in this country SHORTLY before the start of the war all, EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM , fought for the Union. We still have aftifacts including the skull of a dead confedarate soldiar that my great great great uncle Bernard took clean off the body of a confederate soldier. Of course, that soldier wasn't dead yet. And my GGG uncle didn't want to waste any ammunition, so he took a hammer and hit the man (who was already badly injured) several times in the head with a hammer. He apparently had a significant neck wound, so my GGG uncle went ahead (no pun, I swear), and sawed his head off with the nearest available saw. He carried that guys head around with him (not too close, brains oozing out), until it had dried out. that skull was passed down generation after generation, hammer holes still punched in it, to remind us that that we are proud Yankees. I have 1/2 a heart, and so I donate the 677 Small American Flags needed every year on memorial day for the Confederate Cemetary on the Rock Island Arsenal (a 10 minute drive). I get a discount on them at the Military surplus store each year. And heck, why not. They were nothing but slave-owning bigots anyway, but I figure they all might've had families too, so why not give em each an American flag on Memorial Day. Escpecially when you considered that they all froze to death over any of the winters they spent here at the Rock Island Confederate Prison Camp on the Rock Island Arsenal. There families would send food and blankets up from down south, but it just wasn't enough at 42 degrees when the wind comes a 'whippin off the plains. 45 degrees is halfway between the equator and the north pole, so we are just due south of that, but let me tell you, the winters here are horrible. It's too bad 'bout all them rednecks. Real shame. Hard sayin' whatever happened to that old confederate soldiers skull...... hard saying.....   I'm sure there are alot of Yankee (and confederate) stories like this, but it just isn't that often that you get to hear one, now is it?

I do not understand what ANY of this means, and i was wondering if someone might help me out a little..... am i supposed to be Mother Earth or something?         Red Earth is your Conscious Self - who you are and who you are becoming.      Red Earth is the access point to your natural alignment with Earth force. It is the unis mundi, the point of perfect centeredness in the eternal present from which all alignment and magic manifest. Your center, the Earth center, is the secret of gravity's magnetizing force. Red Earth is the channel of harmonic synchronization that is aligned with the galactic heart. From the center point within eslf, you align with this galactic center and connect through your own crystalline structure to the larger crystal grid network. To keep this channel of synchronization open, connect to the elemental energies of earth, air, fire and water, and the seven directional guardians.      Cosmic consciousness is not just 'out there'; it is also resonating within you. Be sacramentally rooted where you are. You are made of the Earth! Look through the 'eyes' in your feet. Your body is the present focus of your consciousness - through it all gifts are received. Remember, too, that your environment is alive and reacts to your awareness of it; therefore, the way you perceive the Earth and your physical form affects the information you receive.      Red Earth is the Earth keeper, the keeper of the garden, the shaman/healer who, through reverence for all life, heals and sanctifies the Earth. Earth keepers preserve the harmonic relationship with nature by connecting to the wisdom held in matter. In Latin, mater means "mother". As you bring light into yourself, you bring light into matter. You and the Earth both contain the holographic seed of the new consciousness emerging.       Center yourself in the present moment! This is where you can most beneficially observe the synchronicities and revelations about your personal pattern and larger purpose. From here your mind can learn to be keenly observant, allowing the larger pattern to take shape as naturally as the small brushstrokes that eventually complete a beautiful painting.      Sit in simple relationship to the Earth, like a poet enraptured in a forest. Be rooted where you are now. Out of synergistic centeredness, you will receive your greatest desires and open to the full flowering of the mystic power of the universe. This synchronization can be seen as the alignment of your personal myth with the greater myth of our times. Myth is the framework or "story" in which the truth of the cosmos is revealed in symbolic form. Utilize it to catalyze your unfolding alignment.      By accepting your physical form and your growth process in this world, you access the hub of centeredness out of which all the truth and magic of the universe unfold.      Take off your shoes. Touch the one Earth. Find a place to dance with the sacred hoop of life. Contribute your vision as an awakened member of the global rainbow family!      Red Earth is also your Higher Self & Guide. (you are guided by your own power doubled)      Red Earth also represents the synergistic workings of destiny that bring people together for common spiritual purposes, as well as the synergy that becomes possible through shared intent. Synergy is the collective expression of individual harmony, the union of different parts in which the whole is exponentially greater than the sum of its parts. When two or more come together in synergy, the resonant vortices between the Earth, the galaxies, and divine archetypal energies are aligned, and all things become possible.         Yellow Seed is your Subconscious Self and Hidden Helper.      Yellow Seed is the ordered pattern of growth. You and your life are the fertile soil, and the mystery blooms within you through the power of your intention or seed thoughts. Just as a seed contains the hologram of its completion, the process of manifestation follows a natural order. In this gestation process, your intention is quickened by Spirit. The charged seed, your true desire or vision, becomes the focus for germination.      What can you open that will support receptivity and assist the germination of your seed intentions? Envision the seed receiving the invitation to grow in the openness of your world. Viscerally feel the possibility of your heart's dream emerging. Your true desires and dreams contain an innate intelligence that can break through even the rigidity of fixed expectations. Planting a new seed, even in the hard soil of old belief systems, can bring unexpected magic and growth.      Be willing to break open the constraining shells of past patterns, the shackles of old belief structures. Call forth your creative involvement with life. This involvement frees and awakens the powerful energy of the life force, shifting your perceptions and experience, catalyzing the manifestation of your dreams. Participate spontaneously in your growth, unrestricted by the illusion of old structure

Then I sat on the bench and started trying on shoes and I kept letting out these huge blasting smelly farts. She started muttering to herself about how I was disgusting and how much it stunk, she kept saying, "It stinks in here!". Then she got off the ladder and walked away.      Later I noticed her pointing at me and my sister said she heard her talking about me to another Wal-Mart employee. This made me mad so as I was walking by her, I couldn't summon a fart so when I was just a bit past her I let out a farting noise with my mouth.

I assumed this meant if I called them and requested and outreach from the mosque, that they would do as they promised and advertised and provide outreach.      Since they will not provide a very simple thing of meeting my request to have a brother do outreach and help me learn more about Islam and because the mosque does not offer Islam education classes for adults, I don't know how to do the prayers right and now the people at the mosque are gossiping about that instead of offering to teach me even though I told them I am a revert and need to learn how to do these things.      I am very frustrated and am starting to believe that there are no real Muslims at the mosque in my town and this is why I have had repeated problems trying to contact the place to become part of the community there.      Should I go back to this mosque again? Or should I quit? There is no other mosque in my town, nothing within any reasonable distance to go to instead. I do not have a way to travel hours back and forth to go to a mosque in a town hours away.      I really don't think the Muslims in my town want any new members to the community, they have not welcomed me as a new member. They have ignored my attempts to communicate with them repeatedly and have ignored repeated requests for assistance in learning Islam.      What should I do?       Please don't say "file a complaint" (file a complaint to who? to the people who I am complaining about, it doens't make sense people) and please do not put up the address for the islamfinder site to find another mosque!!!! There is no other mosque near me, none, it is this mosque or no mosque for me, please I beg you to not suggest "go to another mosque" and not put up the web site to find another mosque. This is the only mosque I have opportunity to go to and this is where all the problems are.  The question is, should I keep going or quit?
20090219170952AAvRlXD	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Did a jinn tell my daughter to say this?	I've been revert for just over a year. I've taught my daughter some things about Islam, but neither or I nor she consider her Muslim yet though she does accept Muhammad as Prophet and Allah as our one and only god. Some times when I try to teach things about religion to her she pays attention, like today she I gave a prayer lesson about why to pray prostrate and what to pray about and she listened and followed. At other times she resists (she asked today if you could wear bikinis and high heels in heaven!).       While she understands why organic foods are healthier, I have never talked to her before about halal foods. Today she asked if there was a market in town where we could buy meat that was from animals that had been raised and slaughtered without cruelty. My eyes lit up and I told her that was the Muslim way and that someone recently told me there is a halal market in town over by the college.      I thought that was neat that my daughter asked that and of course it reminded me to check out that market when I make my grocery trip next week.      Do you think a good jinn silently whispered in her ear and suggested she ask me that question?

Can someone please tell me the function of the myth      and how it relates to our sociaty today..   i really dont understand the story in the myth   i have to do a myth anlyss for english and i have to get a good grade      so far   this is what i wrote.      The story of Jupiter is about the way we are with each other, hospitality good fate and good companionship. He is the king of Gods, Thrower of thunderbolts; this underlines his natural side which is god of storms. He is the Lord of the Sky the god of rain and the gatherer of clouds who controlled the thunderbolt. So his symbol is the thunderbolt and when one rings out it is seen by mortals as a verification of either the God's anger against or his approval of someone. He’s story is about the rise to power he has to defeat his own father and the previous set of Gods called the Titans. Jupiter slept around a lot, and had a lot of babies with lots of goddesses and mortals.         i know its really bad   and i dont even explain how it relates to todays sociaty   please ppl tell me what to add what to take out    and how to relate what i wrote to todays sociaty   pleaseeeee help out

The patriotism of the Frence is blatantly obvious. They can support three major car manufacturers Peugeot, Citroen and Renault.

We need to stand for school boards and textbook boards and boards of education.       We are only just beginning to see the potential of Evolution. We are on the verge of an era where humans will become the major selective force on the human species.      At the dawn of astonishing new powers to shape living creatures, we will also become sources of new variation in other species ranging from disease   organisms up to higher mammals.       It’s not certain we will use these powers wisely or that the consequences will be benign.       We are already unthinkingly crossing the boundaries not just between species but between phyla, creating new life forms, largely so far without social/political controls.
20090203093944AAY2Utq	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What happens when Words of Knowledge turn out to be untrue?	I’ve had friends who are charismatic/Pentecostal and there is one thing that is confusing me.   I am talking about “words of knowledge” and “prophecy.”  As a person not raised in this type of Christianity, my immediate impression of those terms is a direct revelation from the Holy Spirit.  But in practice, I’ve seen countless words of knowledge and prophecies turn out to be totally untrue.  Also, my understanding of prophecy is that it cannot (or should not) be put on a weekly schedule by humans.  For example, I’ve known charismatic pastors to have a prophecy printed out (and photo-copied) every Sunday, without fail.  Usually, it was some general paraphrase of Psalms.        Among non-Charismatic Christians, there is often general prayer and sharing time, where one person may talk about something “God laid on his heart.”  A person might say, “I’m really getting a sense from my devotions that God wants you to go on a mission’s trip.”  But you never hear them say that it was a “Word of Knowledge.”      So my question is: As a Charismatic Christian, what do you do with a church member that consistently has “words of knowledge” that turn out to be untrue?  Is there any sort of accountability process?  If a person claims to have a direct message from God and that message contains false predictions, is there church discipline for it?

Okay well sorry this was very long, my question is what should i do? I personally think that my best friend is jealous, but that is like impossible because when i told her i liked her she told me that she wasn't like that and that she was sorry and i was like its okay so agh this is killing me idk what to do.

20090219174547AAaeJ0h	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	A question about the existence of God??? (No fundies, please.)?	If God created everything that exists and God exists, doesn't that mean God is part of the universe?   And if that's correct, does that not contradict itself?   Because according to religion, God has always existed and always will exist, and that cannot be true if God is part of the universe, because the universe has a beginning...   And yet, the universe is in and of itself an effect of an unknown cause, so does that not mean that there was indeed a creator of existence???   So perhaps, the answer is this: God does not exist as we exist, but is something beyond being or life.      But what is this existence beyond existence? And how can we understand it? Perhaps we may never know... or maybe we will.      But for now, the issue remains an unsolved condundrum, an enigma that drives me completely insane, and something that even the greatest minds cannot fully grasp. But can you???      Any thoughts??? ;)

20090219172838AAqXz7b	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Lottery Etiquette, what would you do? PLEASE read?	Okay, say for instance you have won the lottery. You've won so much that you don't have to work or worry about a career for the rest of your life. Basically, you've kept it on the down-low, because it's hard to explain to people the magnitude of money that you have and you want to remain somewhat modest.    Basically, your friends are all college dropouts in which you will be friends with forever, but you weren't so popular with them, I mean, they called you, but not so much, they all moved elsewhere, and you went to the bottom of their friend list, so to speak. No one really called you, therefore it seemed no one really cared.   Then, you win the lottery, and you buy a fairly contemporary home in an undisclosed community, near some friends who stuck it through with you. So, you are wondering how to treat these friends, but not treat them too much to the point that they expect to be treated everytime. Say for instance, you go out to eat with say, 2 friends, and they are hard working college students, one works 2 jobs while one is currently unemployed. Now, you paid for the bill at the restuarant of course, because, 50 bucks is nothing to you, and they really have to watch their money. But now, your worried that they will expect you to do this everytime. And to be quite honest, you've paid for their things several times, on specific days like, thier birthday or christmas. But, your worried that they will start to think that your their "sugar-mom/dad". On several occasions, they will nonchalantly ask for rent money, such as $475, which really made you mad. Also, you are starting to recieve phone calls and actual contact with the "friends" who abandoned you when they moved away. This makes you angry, because you seem to think that ever since you've gotten rich it seems people are more interested, hence you think all they are interested in is the money you've acquired. You really don't know how to treat them back and you are somewhat hurt by this. I mean, how would you feel if an old crush called you out of the blue and says "We should go out to dinner sometime soon.." when 2 years ago, he turned you down, and wouldn't include you in things?      Basically my questions are stated above, but I will put them more simply if you don't feel like reading...   1. If you go out to eat with friends, should you offer to pay, and should this be something you offer everytime?      2. What would you say to people who basically excommunicated themselves with you for several years and are all of a sudden calling?      3. How can you feel comfortable and explain to people how you've acquired the things you have?      4. How can you let your guard down basically, like, when your thinking people are only hanging out with you because you have money and nice things?      5. For instance, say your in best-buy, and this clown you are with jokingly asks you if you would buy him a new laptop, what would you say back?       6. People in which wouldn't ever even give you the time of day before are calling you and wanting to hang out...what should you say? I say yes, but don't let them take advantage of you...      7. How do you make yourself feel better when you are constantly feeling used, and people keep saying "lighten up" but they have no clue what your going through?      8. If someone asks for you to help with their rent, what would you say? Because you don't want to be the one who everyone comes to when people can't (or don't want to) pay their rent.    And you also don't want to sound like an uncaring scrooge.      Thanks

20090203095024AAFBrsU	Society & Culture;Holidays;Ramadan	Has anyone read "Does my head look big in this" by randa abdel-fattah ramadan?	it was a really good book about a girl wearing hijab at a private school in australia, the author brings up all different kinds of families in the book and it is easy to relate to. I really liked it, mostly because i am a muslim girl who is teh only one wearing hijab at my private school in the US. i loved the book, it made me laugh and is intresting to see how amal (the main character) copes with so many problems that she encounters. including boys :)      so if u have read it tell me what u think, if not try it, it is mostly for young teenage muslim girls but anyone can read it.
20090219180509AAxjPoU	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why Do Jewish people get so much praise for not trying to convert?	Isn't the real reason they do not want you to convert is because Judaism is a Creed and they don't want to encourage letting other Nationalities in, because this would make their race impure?      Ok , if you are Jewish please explain. I don't dislike Jewish people at all, but I do not like their role in the Middle East, sorry but that is the way I feel about that.

20090203094552AAAmXyd	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If Lucifer wasn't happy in Heaven, then doesn't that mean,..?	,..that there's going to be at least one or two human beings who aren't going to be happy there either once they are also in Heaven? The biggest problem I have about Heaven being this place that everyone can enjoy is that not everyone enjoyed it. Lucifer didn't enjoy it and as many as 1/3 of some angels agreed with him and sided with him. This must mean that there is something wrong with Heaven, and even if if humans are easier to please than angels, just the fact that an angel who was in God's presence and worshipped God a whole lot and wasn't happy, does leave open the possiblity that even one or two humans out of millions or billions there may not like it either.    It's funny how Christians never want to really think about why Lucifer was so unhappy there and wonder just what is in Heaven that Lucifer didn't like and made him so unhappy. They want to keep ignoring the possibility of discontentment in Heaven, the kind that Lucifer felt. They never want to stop and really think what was so unpleasant in Heaven that made him want to defy God and rebel against him.    1) If Heaven really was a place of perfect happiness, joy, and contentment for everyone, Lucifer would have never rebelled.  2) Christians say that being in God's presence will be so wonderful that you will never do anything against his will because you won't want to, but guess what, Lucifer along with a third of the angels became discontent and rebelled while they were in God's presence. They didn't feel the same joy as Christians say that they and all other humans in Heaven will feel in his presence.

20090219180223AA37FSt	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Should I correct my little sister on etiquette slip-ups?	Everyone once in a while, my 7 year old sister does something that really bugs me, like, recently, offering my cookies (a birthday present from a friend) to someone else. It's not like I'm not willing to share my cookies, I just felt like she needed to know that it's not right to give away stuff that isn't yours. I told her "you can't offer my cookies to someone else, they belong to me and only I can give them away". The wording probably sounded a little harsh, but I said it in a normal tone. It's such a small and nitpicky issue that my mom immediately scolded me for being hard on my sister. What do you think - should I correct her on stuff like this in the future or just leave it alone?

20090219180525AAZICis	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Does he like me or just want in my pants?	We've been on 5-6 dates. He's always texting me, saying he misses me or asking to hang out. Even if I say I'm busy with friends one night, he'll call or text and ask if I want to hang out after, or if there's been any change in plans. He tells me about his past and how he feels, and opens up to me.      BUT, whenever I talk about feeling depressed or anything negative about myself (like the fact that I get sick easily) he just kisses me and smiles and says something like "Yeah, but everything will be fine." It kinda makes me feel like he doesn't really care or want to hear it, he just wants me to shut up.      Does he love me?
