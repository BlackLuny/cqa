zMs6GUBKaa	Yes I know . In the nirtheast region no they don't . I large cpl makes all the donuts and delivers they to the stores in small trucks before the stores open . Thats why you can't get them nice and warm like you use to years ago . It's a corperate world we live in .|`|p2CJ8zNEaa	every dunkin donuts store makes the donuts on site but not all sale locations are true donut stores many are satellite locations like gas stations that get the donuts delivered from a nearby store. confusing enough for you?|`|H5PFEtVQaa	yes|`|sPiwb8Hraa	For most donuts yes, because of delivery and cost logistics. It is just not possible to deliver those donuts. It is not only logistically impossible, but cost prohibitive. See what I am saying?|`|Svanlzg7aa	No they don't. Where I lived in Florida, the donuts were made at one central location and delivered to each Dunkin' Donuts store. And I'm not talking the ones in gas stations, I'm talking about the regular stores.
nxeQFPEfaa	Mine is Olive Garden. Just love their soup,salad,breadsticks and their portabello ravioli. It's amazing...but here in my small town we have a little hole in the wall restaurant called the Picket Fence and it is to die for. They have a signature soup called Cream of Poblano. It is a white colored broth that is spicy, but they top it with crushed tortilla chips and the best shredded mozzarella cheese I have ever tasted. It is hot and crunch and gooey,melty...Amazing. and they serve it with cajun saltine crackers. Simply great.<br>  <br>  What is it that makes the diner amazing?? A certain dish?|`|rz6l19vlaa	in a paradise island with your significant other next to the beach in a nice warm, not to hot, not to cold weather...

mAlvOFnWaa	Rondevous has great ribs, and BBKings on Beal ave. is awesome too, they have live jazz music, drinks, and great food. Basically if you hit up Beale street your guaranteed to at least find one good place to eat! It's closed off for people to walk around. You can do a lot of shopping, and take in some of the atmosphere of Memphis. I spent about 6 months in Memphis on internship last summer. Beale street was one of the areas of town that I felt safer in. Memphis is not exactly the safest city, so make sure you know where you are going. You DO NOT want to get lost!|`|ucZOCMyAaa	I think it is called THE CRACKER BARREL. <br>  <br>  Anyway, it is really good.<br>  <br>  Here is their site, and I linked it to where it will give you directions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hosted.where2getit.com/crackerbarrel/index2.html" rel="nofollow">http://hosted.where2getit.com/crackerbar...</a>|`|8d6BxvGmaa	ummmmmmmmm olive garden|`|0C145qGLaa	Go to The Rondevous for ribs - the food is awesome and it's a Memphis landmark.

Sah5tjD8aa	tobegin u neeed lots of pure sand. and a very hot furnace.  melt the sand and make it into a long rod of silica.  then slice and dice so that you have little, itsy bitsy wafers.  now, find a very delicate etcher and etch microscopic circuits on the surfaces of the wafers.  then find lots of teeny weeny wire and solder the circuits into some kind of logical system.  next you will need to fabricate some sort of i/o device, out of wire, buttons, solder, and circuits.  this should be large enough to get your hands on, so you can manipulate it.  next you need to figure out a way to see the output, maybe by wiring in a monitor lizard, er, wizard. stir frequently so that noone can mess with your circuits.  next you need to slice more wafers and add brain cells for memory, or is it crushed ginko leaf??? and put that on the table with a sterling silver place setting.  serve at precisely 104 degrees after baking for a week at a temperature slightly above the melting point of silica.  your patrons will immediatley head for the nearest internet cafescafescafes with silica chips between their teeeeth

This indicates that trauma, tumor, or bleeding needs to be ruled out. If the animal has never been hit in the head then trauma is less likely, but nevertheless all of the above possibilities need evaluation by a VET. This needs to be done NOW as the chance of irreversible brain damage exists from prolonged pressure! Think Tumor until proven otherwise!!!!! GO TO THE VET!|`|gpTOomPvaa	That doesn't sound like epilepsy, which generally involves the dog laying on its side and being completely unconscious while convulsing uncontrollably, only to wake up often hungry and lethargic.
