Have a fun year with that annoying piece of crap on your team.  Yeah he does good in his first year, so say the experts, but I don't think it'll work out that way since his QB isn't as good as the past ones he has had.  I would bet he publicly complains by week 3 that he's not getting the ball enough.|`|mkueXAKoaa	Im sure he is glad that he found a team that wanted him. Believe it or not, only a few teams were willing to give Owens a chance to play for them.<br>  <br>  I think that the Bills made a do or die move. Owens will either be very successful in Buffalo, or he will crash and burn and bring everyone on the team down with him.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	1 year deal seems safe.  I like the sound of Lee Evans, T.O., Marshawn Lynch, Fred Jackson, Roscoe Parish, Josh Reed, and don't forget James Hardy.  Wasn't James Hardy hurt last year?  I liked him and think he could be the next big receiver in the league.|`|MxHRjPFHaa	Its a good move...going to buffalo for one season,he's going to shine then come next year he's going to want a huge paycheck from some other team...so expect huge numbers put up by T.O. this season|`|mcKKdbhgaa	Whatever...

WiIUEObTaa	due to economy the market for cards has crashed. common cards. if you have to sell. try newspaper ads. or large flea market in your city. if you do try flea market please take friend with you. a dealer would try 20 to 25 dollar offer. sad but true. it is impossible to price. 200 plus. newspaper add . less if you sell separately . this is the low price. if you can forget about them for few years. market will increase . avoid e bay.|`|WpqfQOTJaa	they're still too new to be worth anything.|`|ModuhBDIaa	Sometimes a huge lot (over 1000) of cards is worth less.<br>  People don't have the space and don't want to bother organizing it to their collection.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately cards between 1980-2000 aren't worth much.<br>  <br>  If you had to sell the cards and want the most from it, consider spend a day organize the cards by team and selling it in team lots.  (like all mets cards lot)  In general the only type of collector who wants commons are team or player collectors.

0AxWZDQRaa	Its possible especially since Crosby has asked the A's to trade him because they signed Cabrera but assuming Crosby would go to the Yankees to play 3rd base while A-Rod (The Fraud) recovers from surgery, what do the Yanks do with Crosby once A-Rod returns?  Crosby would be relegated to backing up A-Rod and/or Jeter at shortstop and Crosby has made it clear he wants to be a starter.|`|3XLEQQI6aa	It might, the A's would like some of the yankees prospects but they probably get who they want anyway, the yankees are being Conservativeve of their prospects|`|4SKmjYrsaa	Crosby is UPSET about not starting, he wants out badly and there are some teams that will take a flier on him, Sorry, Yanks don't seem to be the fit for me...Watch out for Melvin Mora, he's a good fit!

duJgBxUoaa	Im gonna have my own little rant for a change.<br>  <br>  Well..<br>  I wouldnt blame Lucas for saying that he wants to move to another club after what the fans behaved like during the Middlesborough game when we lost 2-0. After seeing that incident when the fans were booing Lucas, I somewhat feel ashamed to be a supporter of lfc. He is a Liverpool player that wears the famous red shirt, people that play for this club dont deserve that kind of behaviour from the fans. No matter if he is rubbish or mediocre we should get behind our own players. Let the staff or the board decide if he isnt good enough for the club. I know its frustrating being an lfc supporter as i am but this carry on isnt meant for a club like liverpool. The guy is probably scared shitless to walk out on the streets of Liverpool after that. Its just not on if you ask me. I dont think his heart will be set for lfc after that incident during that game and I wouldnt blame him.

R0NfdgzLaa	i don't think the duke ball is harder, it's just the seam.  the seam on a duke is much higher, and as such lasts a bit longer.  the kookaburra ball itself doesn't soften up faster, just the lower-profile seam.<br>  <br>  did the west indies change the type of ball mid-series?  i don't know how they managed that.  i agree with people saying different balls are part of cricket, like different pitches, but i don't agree with changing the ball mid-series.  hopefully you just mean they changed recently.  they've done enough to keep their series lead with the pitch - it had 'draw' written all over it before the match started.<br>  <br>  it's no wonder english bowlers struggle overseas, when they use a swing-friendly duke in swing-friendly conditions at home.|`|KyU7thGRaa	i would like to see the ICC have a true coloured ball like one that has a colour on it representing each team that plays international cricket<br>  <br>  gold for aus<br>  green for sa<br>  pale blue for india<br>  silver for nz<br>  yellow for bangladesh<br>  blood red for pakistan|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	WI probably doesn't want to lose anymore, no wonder they changed the ball, I think the ball should be the duke ball due to more battles between bowlers and batsmen.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	waxed|`|558ff4ba8e7d33a8220d4cc8b1701f56aa	No, the beauty of this game is the variety that it has(balls,pitches,players,people) all differ from place to  place , yet the games of cricket stands out as one. Great!!|`|Qr9UFnIuaa	As the Home crowd, pitches and environment, balls should also be used to home advantage. Like SG balls in India.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	I think u r rite.........the ball should be universal|`|AA11088802	yes....

4REeX6lbaa	well to stay calm before your meet go into a place by yourself, and visualize (ik i sound weird but i do it all the time b4 every meet and it helps!) visualize urself keeping a good pace and passing everyone. Also dont worry about the gun, and dont think about it. The gun will make everyone nervous but just ignore it and do your best, find your quiet place before and take a few deep breaths...<br>  <br>  Its been proven that adreniline actually is good because when you are nervous you do a lot better at running. So its not a BAD thing your nervous, but since you are doing long distance i would just focus on keeping your pace. Think in your head as you are running "1,2 1,2 1,2 1,2" or another beat to keep your pace!!<br>  <br>  I hope i helped!!<br>   (now you know all my secrets!) hehe|`|ss1h66ZGaa	Phew!<br>  <br>  It's okay; I'm sure you'll do O.K<br>  <br>  It's perfectly fine to be nervous.<br>  <br>  Just calm down, take a deep breath, and do your best.<br>  <br>  :)|`|NJUhQn60aa	focus focus focus.....<br>  <br>  When at the starting line before the race, do deep breaths, in through the nose, out through the mouth, held for a second.  Just relax and remember you don't win an 800 in the first 100 meters.<br>  <br>  If someone is ahead of you - no need to panic.  If it's someone you can beat - keep your eyes on the back of their head and just stay focused.<br>  <br>  When racing, the fastest person doesn't always win - the person who runs the best race wins.  If the other runner gets you to  not run your race, then you will perform badly.  Stick to your pacing, stick to your goal first lap.  Just get comfortable, try to stay inside on the curves and stick to your pace.
mKtGiuyZaa	why did they put william the refrigator perry and pete rose in the hof?|`|UWJinEbIaa	1. Owens death was the WWE's fault<br>  2.  Benoit's death was the WWE's fault<br>  3.  WWE can sell merchandise with Eddie's name<br>  4.  People have the right to refuse induction into the Hall of Fame.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	Owen Hart's wife won't allow it, evidently, and since she controls his estate, she has the say in anything that happens with his name.  As far as Chris Benoit goes, WWE is trying to make it seem like Chris Benoit never existed.  I agree that both men should be in the Hall of Fame, and I'm sure that WWE would love to have Owen Hart in, especially since he literally gave his life for them, but if Benoit will ever be in is hard to say.|`|b1bb1949f6bd80a6b260437ca822b177aa	calm down.  benoit is a murderer and hart's widow wants nothing to do w/wwe.  by rushing to induct eddie, vince was probably trying to sell one last round of guerrero's book and a few more t-shirts.  regardless, eduardo belongs in the HOF, but i'm sure all concerned would rather he still be alive instead of in there.|`|IkXU06wpaa	i agree with owen being in the Hof but not benoit even though he was a great wrestler he was also a murderer|`|R4dXxh6paa	Yea it's kinda stupid, I agree.|`|xKXu0Qb2aa	Lets Make One Thing Perfectly Clear - It's the WWE HOF.<br>  And The WWE HOF , for the Most Part , is a Complete Joke.<br>  With the Exception of a Few Inductees , it Means Absolutely Nothing.<br>  I Mean - Pete Rose , & "The Fridge"? Really? WTF!?<br>  <br>  The Pro Wrestling HOF is the REAL Deal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now , as for the Question - Eddie got Immediately Inducted because His Passing was Circumstantial , & Didn't Involve any Allegations Towards Steroids or Anything that could Hurt WWE's Reputation.<br>  <br>  Owen's Passing was the Result of a Mishap/Accident that Drew A LOT of Legit Heat from Wrestling Fans (for the PPV Continuing) & the Media for doing Something like that. WWE Caught Tremendous Heat for that.<br>  <br>  Benoit's Passing , Again , Drew A LOT of Allegations towards WWE , Steroids , His Wrestling Style , Etc...<br>  WWE Wants Absolutely Nothing to do with Anything that Draws Negative Attention to Them.<br>  <br>  I'm Sure Owen will make the WWE HOF within 10 Years. Benoit.....I Doubt He Ever Will.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Why does no one understand that WWE is a business? There is no denying whatsoever the contribution Chris Benoit has made to the wrestling world. How would it look in the press with a headline "WWE inducts murderer into the Hall of Fame"? Of course us wrestling fans don't look at Chris Benoit like that, but the press which is always looking for an excuse to bash professional wrestling will. WWE can't afford the horribly bad press attention that would come for that.<br>  <br>  As for Owen, I believe they are waiting for the right moment. That moment will likely be the next time WrestleMania is in Canada. They wait until they go to people's hometown's to induct them, like they did this year with Stone Cold in Texas|`|0562389e678689beab3d55840e8de4cfaa	Well sorry but I cant agree with them inducting Eddie when they did cuz imma huge Eddie Fan <br>  But you are so rite about Owen Hart. I have been waitin to see him get inducted for so long now and have always been disappointed. Owen gave so much to da wrestling business and its a shame to see Vince ignoring him every year <br>  As for Chris Benoit youre rite about dat too cuz even though im 100% disgusted and against wat he did but I still cant deny da fact dat he was one of da best and also should be inducted|`|WKhq6Cumaa	It makes me angry too.Did you know Vince isn't letting Macho Man or Chyna into the Hall of Fame.Chyna revolutionized the way people saw women wrestlers.Randy Savage did just as much for the company as Hogan or Flair.Don't get me started Benoit and Owen Hart,they had more heart than most of the superstars we have today they don't get respect.One question,how come Bob Orton makes it in the Hall of Fame before Sting,Randy Savage, or Chris Benoit?|`|7ImGw976aa	I agree with the Owen Hart, feels like been waiting forever for him to get inducted, thought it could've been this year because of it being the 10 year anniversary......... But looks like not going to happen again. Feels like they've put in some below wrestlers before some of the others, can be really annoying to watch.|`|ES13pJjoaa	Cause Ediie had charisma<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and actually deserved it

i6hVZsyCaa	You are probably taking your back foot off the board and that is why you can't lan on both feet. You should try to lean forward a little. Also, start off in the grass practicing to get the hang of it and not be nervous. Try and practice it everyday, don't worry you'll get it, it just takes time.|`|4qurIEtpaa	Typical, lol.<br>  <br>  You need to jump in the air when you flick the board. As in right when you flick, jump and then stomp down on both your feet.<br>  <br>  Practice on the carpet. Or else hold on to something with your hands so you can hold yourself in the air and flick the board, and land it.<br>  <br>  hope this helped.

It is a decent entry level airsoft gun, and it comes with two 50 round magazines, a speedloader, and a few other accessories. its $60 but the price should be worth it.

Jr9j5f6naa	put your foot at an angle to a wall, and push yourself towards the wall. this will stretch your calves, which prevents shin splints. I am in 8th grade and have been doing track for 2 years now and have never gotten a shin splint because I have always done that stretch. another one you could try is to find a curb or stair or something and let your feet hang half way off the ledge. you should feel it.<br>  <br>  that first stretch I mentioned looks like this: <a href="http://www.live2run4fun.com/images/stretch1.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.live2run4fun.com/images/stret...</a><br>  <br>  the farther up your foot is the more it will stretch.

Yes, distance tends to be harder- but running distance just... -is- harder. you can run distance for a long time because you use different energy, if you run back to back full out sprints you'll feel the weakness, while distance can run a long time before feeling burnt-out.<br>  it just depends what your better at and what you enjoy. There is also hurdle (100m, 300m) and field events, too.|`|ioebCxIwaa	Long distance!! Short sprinters have it soooo easy at practice. We distance runners get into great shape and have endurance.

THe Phillies are strike out artists, <br>  <br>  NYM <br>  <br>  vs.<br>  <br>  NYY<br>  <br>  WS|`|V430UrvFaa	The Mets will not make the playoffs, or will be as probable as the Phillies, who have much better pitching than the Mets. In the NL east there are so many variables, and I think the better pitching team will win, but for the Marlins to be in the talk they need to get better defensively, but the Phillies will probably win the division again.|`|4SKmjYrsaa	did anyone notice the Braves signed Javier Vazques, Derek Lowe, Kenshin Kawakami, and have 3 serious prospects coming up, in Tommy Hanson, Jason Heyward, and Jordan Schafer?|`|yk4S7uuraa	fPHI|`|7uffHRdkaa	Damn right we're going to get on you for this lol I hate to wake you up for your dream, but it's not going to happen. Let's start out by realizing that 2009 is a new season. 2008 is irrelevant at this point. The Phillies don't have everyone coming back. Pat Burrell, a ''Met-killer'', is no longer a Phillie. He's also right-handed, something that helped balance their line-up. Instead, they signed a 4 1/2 years older left-handed hitting LF. The Mets have two left-handed pitcher's in their rotation, who've they exposed themselves too. Obviously, Santana is good against anyone. But Perez had an 0.35 ERA in 26 innings against them last season.<br>  <br>  Why would the Phillies be ''confident?'' Because they won a WS? Than why weren't the '07 Cardinals? Or the '04 Marlins? Confidence always gets outweighed by the ''physical lag'' of a title. In the NL, unless you're that good, and no one has been since the Braves of the 90's, it's practically guaranteed you're due for a downfall. I'm not saying it's impossible for the Phillies to win the division or wild card, like the '02 Diamondback, but they just don't have it to win another World Series or Pennant. Why should anyone believe they do? What are they ''different?'' Because Phillies fans tell us so? I'll believe it when I see it. With K-Rod, what the Mets need to be concerned of is the percentage, not the amount of blown saves. If the Mets won 89 games and blew 29 saves (they won like 5-10 of those games in extra innings), they actually may have provided more save opportunities for him, if he were on their team last season. The Mets and Phillies will probably be nose-to-nose all year. In a way, they help keep each other competitive. I've seen this happen before in the NL East though. Following the '99 season, I didn't think there could be a way the Mets could beat the Braves. Somehow though, the Cardinals beat them in '00 and we made it to the World Series. The Mets had a collapse in '98 and had a pretty nice '99 and '00, so history can repeat itself. Having a Beltran in your line-up on Opening Day ten years ago too? It'd be all too ironic... The Phillies are going down, because this is the Mets division. The Phillies were one time wonders and that's it. If they don't win it this season, that's what they'll go down in history as. It'll probably take them another three decades to get another title... The Mets have the hunger, no lag, arguably a better bullpen and overall stronger roster.<br>  <br>  <br>  3 games behind with 29 blown saves versus a perfect ninth inning? Now what is it? A team with a lot less blown saves versus a probably not-as-perfect bullpen? The Mets ended up 3 behind, with a sh*tty Castillo too. If he's good, and Church is too, and healthy, the Phillies better watch out. Also, Chase Utley may or may not play on opening day and Pedro Feliz probably won't. And J.C. Romero's, one of their set-up men, is out until June. Look at the 1st half stats of Scott Eyre last season. That's your top lefty reliever... Chad Durbin and Clay Condrey only will do good when everyone else is. We've seen them get rocked at times too. A lot of things are going to have to go right for the Phillies to do it again... I honestly think there's just a lot of fans in baseball who don't have the ability to look at things from a wider time frame than one season though. People could believe the defending champ any year will do it again, even if no one has repeated it in how ever long... The Phillies needed luck to win this series. Their numbers with RISP in the first few games of the WS were embarrassing. If the Red Sox were there, they would have taken full advantage of them... The Rays just weren't prepared though. It's not to undermine the Phillies title, because it was well deserved, but this fact separates why they don't have the talent to defend their title... .255 team BA in '08, an inability to score with RISP, a mindless 2 starter, a 46 year old 3 starter, a suspended set-up man, no good right handed bat (unless you count the ''poker'' Werth) will be why this team mushes... This has nothing to do with the Mets. The question the Mets have to answer is can they take advantage of this? Either way though, the Phillies are going to gradually go down, and it'll either the Cubs, Mets, Diamondbacks or Dodgers who benefit.<br>  <br>  penn - You're out of your mind if you think Hamels is equal or better than Santana. I'm sure Santana's two cy young's don't count for anything though, right? Johan will get to one quicker than Cole in the NL... Even Cole would tell you Santana's better. Why would Lidge be better than K-Rod? He's had arm problems and is older. What do you think Lidge will look like once he blows a couple saves? Ask Albert Pujols, he could tell you. K-Rod's got a lot more energy... But that's close. Putz beats out Madson though... Ryan Howard's better than anyone on the Mets? What can he do besides hit home runs? Strike out? lol He's as good as the Mets best hitter, David Wright, but I don't know if he's better. Utley's good, but has hip problems... Beltran is better than any Phillies OF though. Reyes is a better all around player than Rollins and is younger. Sure, Jimmy won a WS, but what were his numbers in the postseason? What will his fans think of his ''frontrunner'' words if the Phillies fade? We'll see... Pelfrey/Perez/Maine vs Myers/Moyer/Blanton? Myers is a headcase, Moyer's old and Blanton's an innings eater who'd consistently bound to have a close to 5.00 ERA. Perez owns the Phillies. Pelfrey's only getting better and Maine's good too, if he can stay healthy...I think it's really funny how people can predict baseball based on two seasons, as if things happen the same every year... I wonder that's why it's been a few years since an NL team has just been able to make it three years in a row. It's been a little while since a team has made it passed the NLDS in consecutive seasons too...

I heard he was gonna be assistant coach for Chivas USA or something like that.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	I know I heard it on radio|`|6uc8ROfWaa	Yea but it was his time already he was 40 and he always deserved a chance in europe but never got it i bet if was argentinian or brazillian and played like that he would of probably went to the best teams in europe but for being mexican didnt get the chance.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	It was his time to retire but he will always be a legend. If went to Europe he probably would have become more recognized but since he was Mexican not as many people gave him attention.<br>  <br>   I hope he goes to the real Chivas and teach the defenders how to defend because our defense is not doing well.|`|82fd54d1c65455ed9c17232b1e7b390baa	I would consider him Mexico's Maldini even though he never played in the same club forever.|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Yeah he retired yestursday.|`|g4ukAIecaa	i think it was about time he retired he had a good run but started to slow down and i hope he gets to be coach or something like that|`|X4aweBgTaa	yes he was a great one..he was still playin at 40. imma miss him i enjoyed watching him play on tv. i regret never seeing him play in real life during his prime..he was definetely the best defender never to play in europe. he was truly a humble player who loved the game.|`|jUeiFZfmaa	I feel really sad, he has done so much in his career that it hurts to know he wont be playing anymore. Hope his soccer school goes smoothly.
BB6HGbnPaa	Nike probably have the worst running shoes out there. Try getting a pair of Asics or Saucony. They are comfortable and cost less than Nike.|`|lEX3CjWlaa	If your doing power walking do not use a running shoe! <br>  <br>  Many department store clerks and even specialty running stores will tell you that running shoes are okay for power walking. They often say this because they haven't done the research and probably don't carry good walking shoes - but they still want to sell you something.<br>  <br>  Walking shoes have different flexibility, torsion control and other features that are specifically made for power walking.<br>  <br>  Go online to Zappos or Shoebuy etc. to see people's reviews of walking shoes. Both carry a large number of them.<br>  <br>  Hope your feet feel better and Hope this Helps|`|m6rlbO3iaa	I have a pair of Adidas  and ive had them for a year i run walk jog work out and go to the YMCA in them. they still fit me and the are the most comfortable shoes i have ever had.

zoEx9ALyaa	THis is what you, or most coaches should know who are coaching JV, . Okay, now I'm not sure if you can lead off in JV, but if you can, it's a simple 3 steps off the bag, for basic beginners, who are learning to lead off. Also, try to teach them to make a 4 with their legs when sliding, when sliding feet first, and try to encourage the people not to use head first sliding, as peoplehave split  their hand sliding head first.A grounder is when the batter hits the ball and the ball is bouncing in the infield. A groundout is something when the batter hits the ball, it's bouncing in the infield, and the infeilder feilds it, and throws it to a base that has a force. Forexample if there is a man on second and first, and a groundball is hit, then there is a force at 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. 1st always has a force. But if there is no man on first, there cannot be a force anywhere else. There are always flyballs. If the ball is hit in the air, and it is caught by one of the defenders, then it is an out. Research Shift, Swing, Stride, And Squish the Bug. It is going to help a lot with hitting. And a Long Flyball that has bounced once and then goes over the wall is called a ground Rule double!! A grond rule double counts as a Double!! So Yeah. Those are some things every coach should know. Hope this Helps.<br>    The Baseball Man|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	A ground ball is a Ground ball literally.. and a ground out mean the ball was on the Ground picked up and thrown to record an out. <br>  Same with fly balls only there in the air. <br>  Theres also pitch counts a full out is 3-2.<br>   4 balls is a walk.<br>  When ur bunting and have two stikes on if you foul the ball of again its an out. <br>  You should have your players run with two outs even is the balls hit in the air.<br>  Hit and runs. Have ur player steal a base while the batters hits it.<br>  There are 9 position players, 9 players in the lineup.<br>  Ur #1 hitter is leadoff you can hit alot and with good speed.<br>  Your 3,4,5 are your best hitters who can drive alot of runs in.<br>  Usually ur worst hitter are 7,8,9<br>  Sacrifice fly is when u have a runner on any base with less then two outs the runner can advance to another base once the ball is caught.<br>  Sacrifice bunt is giving your self an out but advancing a runner.<br>  Double play is recording two outs in one play.<br>  Triple play recording three outs on one play.<br>  <br>  I cant think of anything else right now. If you have me questions just email me !|`|AYiVipawaa	A ground ball is a ball that's hit, and rolls. A chopper is a ball that's hit, but keeps bouncing fairly high. Fly balls are hit in the air, with a pretty big arc, and go pretty far. Pop ups are hit very high, and don't go too far (doesn't go too far out of the infield)

ZCHmhuFQaa	I realize that the bench is much better, and Gasol is more agressive. Kobe Bryant takes shots at the right time of the game so they win. <br>  Did you see the Lakers WHOOP the Suns?|`|i5MInqeMaa	Will see in the post season.  There clicking, but when you barely bit the timberwolves i wouldn't call that legendary.  And beating up on a nash/stoudemire less, no defensive playing suns team is no reason to brag about how legendary you are.|`|0fb4ce4da0f3875154ab271a088412fcaa	Yes, I think this is a phenomenal year out the Lakers. They are coming up in the ratings in everything and are playing the best they have in years. I agree with the legendary team making it's mark in the NBA. They are probably the second best franchise in the past decade and I think this year really put the mark on them. Kobe is having a great year and with all there players healthy they are just even better. If the Lakers aren't in the Finals this year I would be surprised. They only have one competition this year I think and it's my Spurs in the West. The East is a harder contest this year and I think that the Lakers will be the most overcome team. The Lakers are just playing and are phenomenal and awesome this year.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	They are the best team in the league and have the best player in the world that = 08-09 NBA Champions.
c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	Tarps don't tend to use poles and that's the advantage of them over a tent. It gives a problem that you have to find s suitable trees to tie them too though.<br>  <br>  Basically you want to tie a rope "ridge pole" between 2 trees. Keep it level and whatever height above the ground you think is suitable (depends on the predicted weather, temperature and your kit - the lower the ground the more weather tight it is, higher up and more space and you can cook easier under it).<br>  <br>  Next from the 4 corners tie a rope from them to a point low down on a tree or to the ground using pegs or a weight to hold the rope in place. This gives you a roof shape.<br>  <br>  That's about all there is to it.<br>  <br>  Go out and try for yourself and practise a bit.|`|H0MFNydyaa	<a href="http://www.999articles.com/tarp-shelters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.999articles.com/tarp-shelters...</a><br>  check this link for information on tarp shelters|`|QFQ5598Waa	Check out the member lens about backpacking's "big three" at this ultralight backpacking community.|`|tZPOSvHQaa	here you go<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFwmQuH-lo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AFFwmQuH-...</a><br>  this will get you started

The Redskins and Broncos both have problems with thinking that a big name will come along and save them. Broncos still can't stop the run, and they will only do moderately better against the pass now. Which means they will still suck. The Broncos are still worse than the Chargers, and they aren't good enough to get a wild-card spot. They need to do more, and quickly in order to be a competitor.<br>  <br>  Also, gotta say that your name makes you seem like a front runner that started enjoying sports in the late 90's. My bet is you are relatively young, and developed an interest in sports right around the time the Broncos won SBs, the Yanks were winning World Series, and a few years later the Lakers started their Championship streak.|`|MaizmvvMaa	As an eagles fan i'm not happy, but remember he isn't the best coverage guy and he isn't as good as he once was. The one thing he still does bring is fire and passion and a whole lot of leadership, even if he wasn't as good as he once was he will still makes everyone around him better. I hope you guys have as much fun watching him as I did.|`|cdQryr7paa	I'm glad your excited.<br>  But like you said, there are a ton of other things the Broncos need to be competitive.<br>  Luckily they are in a very weak division, so they always have a chance to win the division and go to the playoffs.|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	doesnt matter your still not going to win the afc west in any years coming belonged to the chargers for the last few years and its not going to change just because an aging big name comes to denver.|`|NqzCxepGaa	oohhh yeah u signed a 13 year veteran tht was considering retirerment|`|4KTe107Yaa	dont believe what you read<br>  it didn't happen yet|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	u seem like a bandwagaon fan<br>  denver?<br>  LA<br>  new york?<br>  douche bag/.....|`|CQcLHR0zaa	Broncos just got one of my fav defensive players in the game. he might be old but hes going to be a major upgrade in the broncos defense.

(THATS UN BELIEVABLE). ppl say kobe&james bcuz there the flashiest and most exciting but when you say best player i think of the player who impacts the game the most DIRK. he dragged role players to the finals in the western conference and no other star did that. (lebron did in a weaker eastern conference) dirk is an impossible person to guard. he can get past any bigmen with his quickness or take that bigmen out on the perimeter and use his guard skills to score. and if a smaller person is on him he will post him up. (KOBE IS A PERIMETER PLAYER WHO NEEDS A SHAQ OR A PAU OR AN INSIDE PRESENCE TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PLAYOFFS, DUNCAN IS A POST PLAYER WHO NEEDS A GINOBLI OR A PARKER TO HELP HIM HAVE PLAYOFF SUCCESS.

mber3JoAaa	Butler is good, but I would stick with having Broom in the side. As has been previously mentioned, our batting is often fragile enough as it is without lengthening the tail even more.|`|gz2M5hsBaa	Ian Butler at seven, what are you smoking. We have this other player, Vettori, who can bat much better, maybe you haven't heard of him.<br>  <br>  I don't think we can dump Broom. Our batting lineup is weak enough as it is, without chucking in an extra bowler. Besides, Butler has never really convinced me he's that good. He took a fair amount of wickets during the twenty/20 matches, but he also conceded a lot of runs.|`|2Gz6pVbKaa	Its great to see someone do well after such a long time out due to injury, however it would affect balance of team I dont think he can bat above 8. Ryder and Elliott will pick up occasional wickets there both more than just part time bowlers. Maybe Butler will have to wait for an injury to get place in 11, how ironic.

Flexibility training involves integrated strategies for proper muscular balance.  In other words, stretch only the muscles that are tight while leaving the muscles which are not tight alone.  This will allow for muscle imbalances to be corrected.  Go to Performbetter.com and purchase a video on flexibility and performance training or see a personal trainer.|`|WzusAmjYaa	a really cool one here: If you stand up, and bend down and dangle, but not like you are touching the floor....just bend down to the point your as far as you can get with no pain....and just dangle there for 2 minuets. After that, get up and shake around a little, and go back down, now you should be dangling alittle farther comfortably!|`|ZOYyfBFYaa	Reach to your toes and to the floor. That exercises legs and arms.

EmYNUZcXaa	practice doing splits and then start slowly by adding a book under each foot when you do it...then add another to each and so one. i used to do it with about 9-10 books under each foot. i would also do the splits and lean backwards to the leg you would be holding and reach for my feet. doing the bridge will also help your back. just ALWAYS make sure you are fully stretched and your muscles are warm before attempting the biellmann. if it hurts or pulls too much, stop, and keep stretching and attempt it later. good luck to you!!|`|AA11832206	hold onto a wall grab your foot and continue to stretch it upwards until you reach beillman position. Hold for at least ten seconds and repeat with other foot.|`|8u88LysRaa	Off ice- Hold on to a chair (or a wall or something with support) and lift your leg up just like you would for a biellman. Don't bring your other hand up to the shoe to pull it up like you would on ice... Keep it on the wall. Just keep on stretching that foot. If you are working on back biellmans, try this on the other foot. If not, just do your good side.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|PNFnZGrpaa	Whel I learned the Bielmann spin, I just stretched my back as much as possible.  Try doing bridges.  If you don’t know what that is, the easiest way is to lie down, put your hands like you are giving two high-fives, bring them next to your ears, and then put them on the floor.  Them bring your legs up like you are going to do crunches.  Then push yourself up.  Try to get your stomach as high as possible.  <br>   I also did what I call “mermaids”.  Lie down on your stomach.  Put your hands on the floor as if you were going to do push-ups.  Push your body up.  Then try to touch your chin with your toes.<br>  <br>  That is basically all I did.  Remember, do NOT hurt yourself!!!  I hope you get your Bielmann as soon as possible!!!
xE6WXVIeaa	Without looking at it myself, I can't tell you what's wrong. There will be schematics in the manual that you can use to check the locations of the parts ( in particular where the pins for the trigger and sear go in the grip, as well as where the springs go). If you don't have the manual, you can download it from Tippmann.com. It sounds to me like you've got a pin in the wrong place, or a spring slipped out of place when you put the reciever halves back together.

Q8yzhUewaa	jump rope, calf raises, toe raises, walk and run on tip toes, exercise your calfs a lot, try to buy a strength shoe, look up how to jump higher online|`|XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>|`|C4mzZwiWaa	practice...|`|vFHxY8CNaa	squats are really good, do them whilst holding dumbbells.

vN7hzs0taa	To most people who follow wrestling at all it should be In ring ability.<br>  <br>  However since most people are under the kool aid that wrestling is 90% promos and 10% in the ring then Charisma.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Ring skills hands down.<br>  I love technical wrestling. Promos are great and all but in the end, what happens in the ring is what counts.

Have you thought about investing in a bivy?? Works incredibly well in the cold, is a much lighter option than a tent but it can be a little claustrophobic but if you like gazing into the stars it′s well worth it. Depending how long you′re camping for I would recommend that you get yourself a new pack because a sleeping bag is essential can you imagine if you share that sleeping bag and his gets wet, then what?? If you′re planning on carrying a light load then take another look at your oven and fuel sources and even look into dehydrating your food. <br>  <br>  Depending on how rough your camping experience will be sharing a sleeping bag may or may not be a problem but the last thing I want to do after long days of hiking and the strong possibility of not showering for a few days is to share my sleeping space regardless of whether it′s loved one or not.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Use two identicle sleeping bags and zip them together....thats it!|`|XVljoYZ5aa	Oh yes!

RsTm8uUlaa	Try not to be the power hitter. Just try to be a hitter. Make sure you're focusing on making contact, not trying to hit a home run. Coaches will like the fact you can make contact more than the fact you can hit it far. Here's a list of tips and drills:<br>  <br>  1. Always throw your hands at the ball. It'll get you through the zone quicker and you swing right at the ball. Don't use your arms or shoulders, you'll swing late and there's a possibility of injury.<br>  2. Make sure the bat is the right size and has a good drop weight. You don't want to swing a bat that's too heavy, or you'll swing late.<br>  3. Leave your head down, don't bring it up. Watch the ball hit the bat.<br>  4. Wait for your pitch, if it's a ball or not where you want it, don't swing.<br>  5. Be aware of what types of pitches the pitcher has. Sit back on change-ups, don't swing to early.<br>  6. Don't grip the bat too tight, it'll sting your hands and give you blisters.<br>  7. Don't get down/lose confidence because of a previous hit.<br>  8. Know your strike zone.<br>  9. When you're using a pitching machine, chances are you're getting used to the speed and not actually watching the ball. WATCH THE BALL!<br>  10. Hit off a tee. If the tee moves you're not hitting the ball right. Hit the middle of the ball. The only way to do this right is by watching the ball.<br>  11. Soft toss. If you don't know what this is, it's when someone kneels next to you and tosses a ball in front of you, and you hit it (usually into a fence).<br>  12. Always catch the ball out front. If the balls over the plate, it's too late. You should make contact before it crosses the plate.<br>  13. If you're right handed, and you hit the ball and it goes foul to the left you're too early and if it goes to the right you're late. If you're left it's the opposite.<br>  14. Don't be afraid of a walk. I don't know about you, but a lot of people want to go up there and hit. If you're going to want to hit (like most do) wait for your pitch. Take a ball (or 4).<br>  15. Think single or double not fences. A single or double can be a lot more helpful than flying out trying to hit the game winning homerun.<br>  <br>  Bunting:<br>  1. Hold the bat out with both feet toward the pitcher. Hold the bat at a 45 degree angle upwards like / but at 45 degrees. You know what I'm saying?<br>  2. Don't chop/poke at the ball. Use your legs to go up and down and let the ball hit the bat and die off.<br>  3. Pull the bat handle towards third to bunt to first and vice versa. Never back to the pitcher or into the air. Try to get it down the third base line.<br>  4. If it's a sacrifice, it doesn't matter where the ball is, you have to get the bunt down.

NJUhQn60aa	you are just using muscles you aren't yet used to.  If your throat hurts, run with your mouth closed and breath through your nose.<br>  <br>  The only thing that will help is practice and getting more miles under your belt.  Don't worry about how fast you are going, just concentrate on getting in the miles.  The faster times will come later, but you need that good base and experience.<br>  <br>  As far as the stomach, that could be as easy as not eating too much right before running.<br>  <br>  Believe it or not - it does get easier.|`|nEm9xu1yaa	get in shape and you'll have to be embarrassed until you are fit.|`|ZKRdihV2aa	AHHHH! same here... but ike you i wanna stick it out...just keep on running at ur own pace...but DO NOT WALK ...a slow jog is better....woow i dont even take my own advice...but its good advice..i started track today and already want to quit..but im gunna try...my friend told me that the first week is the toughest because they wanna automatically get rid of people who dont wanna be there (like track is a joke)..but after that hopefully it gets better!! :)|`|ec2b7eeb4b63b9a31364982889371977aa	work on breathing more<br>  and also finding a better way to warm up<br>  <br>  if you start running no warm up thats sometimes what happens<br>  <br>  you might wana try breathing in though your nose and out though your mouth<br>  <br>  i dont do that (because i forget) but it helps with cramps for after your running|`|o9PvP75Vaa	Work out more :D

If not, don't.<br>  <br>  Do all of the following workouts until you die. If you're too lazy to do them until you die basically...don't be a SEAL, because there, it will be way harder.<br>  <br>  Situps, Pushups, Pullups, Running, Dips, Swimming. Make your body muscular basically, because if you have a lot of muscle, you're probably strong... and it takes strength to do what the SEALS make you do.|`|SVdVbYsFaa	well I,m a college swimmer so of course I'm going to say swimming. try to do about 6,000 meters i day (should take a good 3 hours). first days of doing this will be hell but after a week itll get better i recommend breaking it up into mini races to keep your confidince up. <br>  <br>  i love swimming and i hope you will too.
AA10702710	Check the link below for what is possible...|`|8ivnzNi5aa	If you live in the US, in a state other than California, New York, New Jersey, or Massachusetts, you may be able to find kits for such things at any of the larger sporting goods stores, or an independent gun shop.  If you're in one of the four states I listed, or not in the US, you're probably stuck out of luck.  Go to www.nra.org, and they may be able to help you further.|`|AA11694178	For your first effort, buy a good kit from some place like Dixie Gun Works at www.dixiegunworks.com, Midway USA at www.midwayusa.com, Cabela's at www.cabelas.com, Track of The Wolf at www.trackofthewolf.com, Natchez Shooter's Supplies at www.natchezss.com or Muzzleloader Builder's Supply.<br>  <br>  If you were to try to simply buy a chunk of wood, a barrel, a lock, etc to make a gun, you would likely fail miserabley.  Gun building is a very specialized art and is not somethign that you can simply jump into with no training or experience.  If you will buy a kit from one of these suppliers, most of the really difficult work will be done.  This will prevent you from making a bunch of bad mistakes and throwing up your hands in frustration.  After you build a few kit guns and read a lot of books and maybe get some hands on training, you will be <br>  better prepared to make a pistol or rifle from scratch.  I have built many muzzleloading guns from kits and parts that I have bought from some of the sources that I have mentioned and I am not yet ready to start a gun from just a chunk of wood and a bag of parts.  I may have the bag of parts but you can bet your booties I use a semi-inletted or 90% inletted stock to build one.  In fact, right now I have one in my basement that I am working on.  I bought my lock and other parts from one supplier and ordered a custom barrel from a barrel maker in Florida.  I bought the roughed out and partially inleted stock from another supplier.  Many parts from many sources but still I am still not ready to start with a chunk of wood to make the stock.  Believe me, if this is your first gun, a kit will be all of the chalange you will want.  Take your time and work carefully and you can end up with something you will be proud of.  It usually takes me a few months of working a few hours every evening to complete a muzzleloading rifle that I can be prooud of.  Starting with a kit will cut some time off but it is still time consuming to prepare all of your metal and wood and apply a finish that looks good.  I brown my metal and hand rub my wood finishes.  Lots of hours of most enjoyable and rewarding work.|`|QC2NozBkaa	Your best bet would be to get a kit.  Dixie Gun Works has some good ones.  Trying to make one from scratch without some basic gunsmithing skill  will be frustrating to put it mildly.

Jermaine O'Neal was traded to the Indiana Pacers for Dale Davis.Shawn Kemp and Rod Strickland was added in as well. They proved to be headed to the Finals when they had the WC Record till March of 2001, until they lost 17 of their last 25 games. They were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs. Ruben Patterson was added in the offseason that year, Dunleavy fired as coach, replaced by Mo Cheeks. They also signed Derek Anderson and Arvydas Sabonis (lol , who wouldn't forget the infamous towel-throw into this man's face courtesy of Rasheed Wallace). The following year, Sheed, Damon Stoudamire, and Woods were arrested for marijuana possesion. Zach sucker-punching the "Kobe stopper" Ruben Patterson during scrimmage. So now, you know why. :)<br>  <br>  2. 3 times. In '04-'05 they had 59-23 record, second best in franchise history along with the 15-1 division record, the best in NBA history. the next year, their record was 52-30, the year where they won the NBA Larry O'Brien trophy, also known as the NBA Championship Trophy. The next season, they had a 44-38 record despite big-time injuries.<br>  <br>  3. We all know why. Hurricane Katrina struck the Big Easy and the Hornets were forced to play in OK City.<br>  <br>  4.  Buffalo to Moline, Illinois to Milwaukee to St. Louis then to Atlanta. So the Answer is 4. ( I didn't count the Tri-Cities for the reason that they only played in one place, not in those Tri-Cities)<br>  <br>  5.  That was the lockout year where NBA players went on a strike because of money issues. They were tied with the San Antonio Spurs for having the best record in the league. Their record was 37-13.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ----------------------------<br>  Technically speaking if you have the best record in your division after 82 games of play, YOU GET THE DIVISION TITLE.<br>  Now, during the post season, after you win the Eastern Conference Finals, you get the CONFERENCE TITLE.<br>  In the finals, after you win against the western conference team, you get the TITLE.<br>  So, Miami won the Division Title in 3 straight years.

But the other 2 favorite teams of mine are Chelsea from the EPL and Juventus from the Serie A. I've always watched Real Madrid, ever since I can remember, I can remember all the players, well, most of them from back then. Olympique Lyon, I started watching them since around '00, Juninho is one of my favorite players of all time. Chelsea I started paying attention to in '02, a little before Abramovich took over the club. When Ranieri was still the Chelsea coach, I really liked how they play, that's what attracted me to start watching Chelsea and after that, I just never have stopped supporting them. About Juventus, I have also been watching them for a long time, Del Piero is the reason I started watching Juventus, the way he played, attracted me to watch Juventus, and like Chelsea, I never stopped watching them. But yeah, my 2 favorites are Real Madrid and Lyon, a bit more than Chelsea and Juventus.<br>  <br>  3. No, I wouldn't start the season again.|`|qbPbvLuLaa	1.

jY6cis4Kaa	Wow! That's a good question. There have been so many fights on PPV over time and a lot of them, I can't remember if they were PPV events or not, due to the fact that PPV fights date so far back.

I'm sure I'm probably overlooking some other event, but I just can't remember all of them.|`|0S0wRN0haa	their have been so many BS fights on PPV how about that holyfield v Valuev. 12 rounds of nothing.|`|bqrLJeceaa	Well jones calzaghe which did poorly at the box office, and was not even a fight after the first round.

AA11914978	As you go deeper the weight of water increases its 'pressure' so you need to equalise your inner ear with the pressure of the surrounding water. To do this is simple but please try it first while sitting comfortable at home and don't 'force' it. Firstly, pinch off your nostrils with your thumb and fingers then blow VERY gently against this through your nose. You should feel a little 'pop-plop' in your ears as the pressure increases in them. As I said, do this gently and often until it is natural to you then you can do it on the way to the bottom of the pool. The trick is to do it before any real pain is felt and you may need to do it twice to get to 12 feet. The pressure that you equalise into your ears will release naturally on surfacing so don't worry about that - its getting the pressure 'in' which requires working at.|`|9Z7Pl9fcaa	I'm wondering the same thing...

cKDralDHaa	I'm kind of pissed about it actually. I was one of the few people who was actually rooting for Kizarny to be on Smackdown ever since the first video package they gave him. I sat around waiting for months until he actually debuted. I was hoping he'd have some carnie workers coming with him during his entrance. I thought other then that his Debut match with MVP was so-so. It's not like wrestlers have great debut matches no matter what brand they start off on.<br>  <br>  Then he gets taken off, appearing in 1 battle royal and 1 backstage segment with Vickie then they release him....no chance whatsoever.

Depending on the fan reaction the guy will either stay, or his gimmick will be reworked.<br>  I think Kizarny was taken off TV to rework the image as he wasn't that accepted by the fans.<br>  Maybe Kizarny didn't agree with the rework ideas and opted on leaving. Or maybe he came in at a time when they were doing those random drug things and he got caught??

t8JQJP7Xaa	Well let's be honest. He's not going to go back to doing what he was doing prior to his injury. It will take him 2-4 weeks to get himself accustomed to game pace and team chemistry. His minutes will be limited, and his endurance will be watched. He might commit a lot of touchy fouls, because he won't be used to game speed. Neverthless, just his presence will be good for the team as he provides a good interior presence. So guards who penetrate won't have an easy time laying it up over him. This is where Lakers get punished the most anyways, guards like CP3, Parker, Wade, even LBJ easily get past the Lakers and get lay ups. But Bynum's length will change shots and thus will result in some missing. So you can expect their defense to get better once he returns.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	his comeback will give LA a much needed defensive presence.|`|L66IcsuUaa	He'll make sure that our rings are secure.

e0M5lpc2aa	I take it this is a pre-draft trade?<br>  You have NOTHING to lose if you take this trade pre-draft.<br>  In all honesty, you're getting a steal.<br>  Utley is the best 2B out there, and 2B is a very shallow position. Oswalt is good, and potentially a keeper, but you already have Hamels, so Oswalt is expendable. Also, SP is a DEEP position with lots of talent, so you can still pick up some good name players in the draft.<br>  Do this trade, and then keep Braun, Longoria, Utley and Hamels.<br>  You'd have 3 top 25 players, and Hamels (who Yahoo! unfairly ranks at 45) is coming off a monster postseason and has 20W and 250K potential. Though I don't see him hitting either mark, he has the possibility.|`|AA11720887	I would probably make the deal but you are really trading McLouth, Oswalt, and Stewart for Utley. Dukes is available in most free agents lists. Utley is one of the best in a position that has little competition. Take the deal and plenty of Pepto Bismol.|`|qFuIfIqSaa	oh yeah! definitely take it. stewart and dukes are both decent. so basically utley for mclouth and oswalt, and your pitching is strong, oswalt is up and down pitcher, and your other 2b's suck. take it in a heartbeat.

AA10179493	I definitely think Kane and Toews are going to be huge parts of the team as they are this season. Give them a year or two to learn a little more. Havlat's been doing so well lately too. And if Versteeg can avoid a sophomore slump, he'll do great. He's having an amazing rookie year.<br>  <br>  And I believe that the Hawks are well covered defensively also. Seabrook and Keith make an awesome pair and Campbell and Barker work well together too.<br>  <br>  It was tough to see Wisniewski go, and I'm hoping it wasn't for nothing. I hope we get some good things from Pahlsson.<br>  <br>  That would be awesome if the Hawks were champions a few years down the road. With a little more experience for the young guys, it's a definite possibility.|`|xsizQ5X1aa	If the blackhawks keep the core of there young good talent than in the next couple years, they will be contenders. The only problem I see is them being able to keep all of them, and still meet the budget cap.|`|a9d1c39e771753ee705728da48b7614eaa	I think that once Kane, Toews and some of the other young guys have more experience under their belt, they will be hard to beat. They still seem to going through a learning phase this year. I would have to agree that they could be ready to compete for the Cup in a year or two|`|Jy9KNgSDaa	I think that the blackhawks will have fans coming out of the wood work in the next two years

AA12170560	Fast is running the 40 yard dash in a given time.<br>  <br>  Quick is agility, on field mobility, and his reaction time.|`|B8sJEBxTaa	They are referring to agility which is lateral movement and acceleration. As you probably have seen, some people rely on juking people to get open, this requires agility to do. Also, running backs usually change directions a lot at the line. This also requires a lot of agility.|`|sMkJGmXaaa	People generally say fast when he is ''straight-line'' fast and quick is more of his moves are faster and he has more agility.|`|9P2C1Hfaaa	for example darren sproles on the chargers may have the same 40 time as brandon jacobs but he's obviously quicker. darren sproles is more quick than fast.|`|PJFeRy0Zaa	I think it means he is explosive, like Defensive ends are explosive/quick but not fast|`|RQAXysWVaa	what everyone else said basically|`|80267f252cf4007de4a44d2334671ed8aa	what it means is that he is agile and quick on his feet and able to make quick cuts.

yererDcnaa	my whole career of baseball i played first base never wore a cup (never was comfortable wearing one), which many may call stupid but i made it out okay and with a complete pair in between my legs. however, i have seen other guys guys get hit in the area without a cup and they are down for the count.<br>  <br>  and so my advice to you is that if you feel comfortable with a cup in then yes you should probably wear one. it never hurts to be protected in case some freak accident happens and you get nailed where it hurts. but if you feel that it hinders you in some way (maybe makes you run weird or something) then i say you would be okay and get by without wearing one.<br>  <br>  and yea, id say a huge majority of mlb players wear cups.|`|5LXAhJktaa	Yes, wear one.  What if someone throws a curveball inside?  You're fooled and turn your hips thinking its a fastball, and you get one right in the testes, which hurts even with a cup.<br>  <br>  And you don't want your coach to go in for the cup check.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  What's he gonna do Matt, stick his hands down his pants and take it out every half inning?|`|Wx6yx6YMaa	You should wear one. You might get a line drive that drops and bounces and hits you. It wouldn't be that fun.|`|XDTNSPO2aa	No!!!!! you might want one if batting i ran into that problem but no outfielding|`|4O2eM1yKaa	i played baseball for over 9 years and only wore a cup for about a month. outfielders don't really need a cup, infield its whatever you like and catcher its a must.|`|AHQX3EYHaa	yes you should. ive learned the hard way. you can by cheap and good cups at baseball-mechanics.devhub.com|`|5yZICXImaa	Yes. Even though your an outfielder your also a batter. Your want to get use to one at a younger age so it doesn't become a problem when your older and have harder hit balls at you and of course the MLB outfielders wear one because just like you they bat also and can risk a ball to the junk.|`|P1bO87l1aa	Wear one no matter what position you play.  The ball could take a bad hop and hit you there and you would wish you had worn a cup.  Most likely you will never need fit. but its better to have worn it and protect yourself than not to have worn it.  Police Officers usually never need their body armor (bullet proff vest)  but most of us won't go on duty with out it.

Sm7Oev8Iaa	With your current height an weight you probably will wind up at safety if you can achieve a 40 time of 4.4 or 4.5. A good way to this is to find a glute and ham machine. This will stretch out your ham strings an your glute muscles. Also try running stair and hills. As well as do box drills. Box drills and stairs help you fast twitch muscles. While hills build your push power. To close up leg workouts do parallel squats the last three in. help your speed as well. To work on those arms do bench presses, curls, and triceps. And don't forget your abs. these are crucial.|`|iCzRC6LUaa	You have to be willing, don't just take our advice.

People who say it has too much spins is obviously never seen a real Taekwondo spar, EVER or been trained in the area and have mostly seen DEMO's.<br>  <br>  Okay so Taekwondo kicks are FAST and very STRONG.<br>  For example: During Myth Busters (a famous show) --><br>  they tested martial arts' kicks.<br>  Taekwondo's back kick has a pressure (when landed successfully) of a truck bumping into you at 20 mph. Thats the strongest any kick has gotten so far.<br>  So if you really want kicks<br>  Go for Taekwondo<br>  give it a shot.<br>  Good luck!!|`|XAk6jZBhaa	Tae Kwan Do includes about 80% of kicking|`|rEhCPxcMaa	Taekwondo no doubt|`|MxlgAOdvaa	muay thai but u gotta kick banana trees to kill the nerves in ur shins and make them weapons|`|1e576939d9233965a515d8aaa9992a28aa	Given what you've eliminated....  <br>  <br>  French Savate and Muay Thai are really all that's left that heavily use kicking.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	tae kwon do.

Their kicks are both strong and damaging, and definitely offensive.  I doubt you'll find a style of Kung Fu which will feature agressive kicks in your area if you can't find this Taekyon (which I'm not familiar with, but I know a great deal about Kung Fu systems, and few of them are comprised MOSTLY of kick attacks)... and especially if you find capoeira to be dancing (it's more effective than that, although the system does require extreme flexibility and cardio movement - but find any kick training that isn't cardio and I'll show you a purple people eater).<br>  <br>  I can't recommend Tae Kwon Do because I have found very few schools in the world which offer any real offensive kick training at all, and most Tae Kwon Do students end up with little defensive ability either.  Most of the time, it's a sport, where you score points and look pretty doing kata.  I know there are exceptions - but I challenge you to find them.  It's a needle-in-the-haystack affair.<br>  <br>  Be sure to stretch daily to prevent injury.  Happy training.<br>  <br>  Grandmaster David A.

VCPrxDecaa	There is a small part on the right side of the bolt that is called the extractor, and looks sort of like a tiny hook.  If when you pull the bolt back, the shell stays put in the chamber, the extractor is likely broken, if not just very dirty.  There is usually a separate piece on the left side of the bolt called the ejector, but the problem you've described sounds more like the extractor.|`|yqx9YTBJaa	Usually there are two separate parts:  the extractor, and the ejector.<br>  <br>  The extractor hooks around the rim of the cartridge.  If you move the bolt back and forth, it'll pull the cartridge backwards and forwards.<br>  <br>  When you fire the gun, the action moves rearward and drags the cartridge with it.  When the cartridge hits the ejector, it is forced outward and ejects from the gun.|`|X3tyGKcBaa	Dont want to sound like a smart *** but have you cleaned the action extremly well I have had several over the years & some are more finacky then others|`|wbhqShh6aa	depends on your specific model but most have some kind of ejector claw that essentially grabs the case...something must be wrong there...|`|xcG5Tasiaa	Try checking your extractor spring, it may be loose, missing, damaged, or worn out. <br>  <br>  Also, you REALLY should specify models when asking questions like this. :-D|`|BckKMf0zaa	The claw might not reach far enough, i would take it to a gun smith to get it checked out.
tS33KBsAaa	for us Saturday meets are about 3 hours. regular ones are about2. depending on your team size is how many events you are in. you may be in 3 maybe even none to the someone else a chance. are usually every day after/before school.  track takes much time and devotion. don't worry if your not good at the feild stuff, not everyone does everything. try hurdles,if you are taller. they are mostly sprints & still very fun. you get the hang of it after a while. I love hurdles!!! sorry, but don't do distance. you have to still be fast& be able to go far.|`|iCzRC6LUaa	What you said about your mile, you dont need good long distance, you need to be quick.

6Efhd6lNaa	Hes got amazing TALENT, but i won't consider him an elite player until he puts it together for an entire season and leads a team to the playoffs. Which the Knicks won't likely make this year. And to say he'd beat Lebron 1 on 1 is ridiculous. Just because he could dunk over him doesnt mean he would beat him. Dont you think Lebron could dunk over Nate as well?|`|4gJTpitraa	I hope you're kidding...<br>  <br>  He averages around 10 points, and that is his only noticable stat. That is NOT MVP material. Knicks will get destroyed first round, no matter who they play.<br>  <br>  Yeah, he dunked over Howard, while pushing his head down and having Howard with his back turned and not contesting it. If Howard tried to block Nate's dunk, Nate would get owned, even if Robinson jumped off of Wilson Chandler's back (that dunk deserved no more than a 35)|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	He's certainly fun to watch, but that's an overstatement isn't it?

A few other players can play into that category also.<br>  <br>  Besides, last time I checked the Knicks were 13th in the East....|`|qaz33UnNaa	First of all, the knicks are NOT going to make the playoffs. Secondly, Nate is a beast. Thirdly, he could not lead a team to the championship right now.

Possibly Final Four, they are that good.<br>  <br>  I also think Louisville will go real far as well as Pitt.  My sleeper team is St. Marys.

AA12170560	You can play linebacker if your coach says so...<br>  and ONLY if your coach says so.<br>  <br>  Even if you can't see without your glasses...if the coach wants you at linebacker, thats where you'll play.<br>  <br>  It's his team.|`|1i9mrq5Yaa	weight?<br>  height?<br>  speed?<br>  hitting hard doesnt mean shi*|`|4eLzY2hfaa	hitting hard, and strength trumps glasses.  get yourself some athletic frames.|`|KfFb9vowaa	yea you can because you would be a force in the middle because when you lay a guy out and hes havin a hard time getting up they will never run the ball your way|`|zJC18FtAaa	So tired of kids asking this question on here <br>  Ask your COACH|`|QJzno2Mgaa	Agree with MattKemp,<br>  <br>  Ask your coach, see what your good at or something|`|2pMVnCIpaa	It's very rare. If your fast enough, I would look more towards a strong safety position. Unless you are very built and sturdy and have matured physically far faster than most your age. Linebackers are generally veteran's whose bodys are done growing. I really would look towards a strong/short safety position, but you have to be very lean. If you are a more husky freshman, look toward a defensive end. Defensive ends range in height and weight at all levels. But if you think you have what it takes at linebacker, i encourage you to go for it.<br>  <br>  In addition, linebackers are the smartest people on the field, with exception to the quarterback. If you know the game well, you would be a very good linebacker. Football is 90% mental and 10% skill. Knowledge of the game is the most important to coaches, teammates, and yourself.|`|xy7UinRfaa	Well hitting hard isn't everything in football if you are fast that is a major plus because you can play in coverage packages.  Being strong is good as well to fight off blockers and bring down larger running backs.  Honestly never really seen football players with glasses but i think it would work as long as they don't fog up in the helmet and stay on your face.  You would probably need some sort of strap to go around your head to help hold them on.  Or you could go with the Sports goggles they may work i have a feeling they would fog up in your helmet because of all the steam/sweat.|`|pwaRd8y8aa	I think you could. If you got the strength, speed, and skill, any coach will look past glasses or being a freshman. Some kids where goggles, which help them, so maybe try those. They might make you look a little tougher for all I know. Somebody who hits hard and has a mean look is perfect.
KwqZmlZRaa	Ugh what horrible answers :(<br>  Well I'll give it a shot. So I'm a sophomore at my high school and started playing tennis about my 7th grade year. Freshman year I posted a question similar to this because i wanted tips on how to make varsity. Well I did and played at #6 for a good school in SoCal (best division in the U.S) and my team this year won our whole division. So take this next bit of advice to heart.<br>  If you haven't played tennis, you can't play tennis. I know that sounds harsh but hear me out, tennis takes time and lots of practice, it's one of the hardest sports there is. Practice, practice, practice. You said you were going to hit a with a friend, i recommend doing it a lot. Be the first one on the courts and the last one to leave. make the coaches think your a coachable kid and show them how much you can improve and listen to what they have to say. ask other players if they want to hit with you over the weekend and maybe see if there are any tennis clinics you can try around your town. Chances are by the end of the season you will be playing much, much better and will still have a LOT of fun. also something I have learned.... sports like football or basketball you stop playing seriously during high school unless your going to play in college and few make it big. Tennis you can play your ENTIRE life!! If you ever goto a tennis club there probably old men playing doubles together and still having a blast!

BGl88O5Faa	Hello,<br>  Golf originated in Scotland in a basic form - hit a ball with a club, try to get to the finishing hole with the least strokes as possible. The earliest reference as to when golf started goes back to 1457, when King James II of Scotland banned golf and soccer to keep his men practice archery. But the game continued to develop over the decades and centuries until 1744, when the first golf rules were written down in Edinburgh.<br>  Hope this helps |`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	This is a highly debated question.  The first course that really comes to mind in history is St. Andrews in Scotland, but both the Scotts and the French lay some claim to the start of golf.  It is hard to say as many of the courses that were played back in the day were made to be "part of the landscape."  Personally I would say Scotland really made the game what it is today.  Over there it is goph more so then golf.  <br>  <br>  Also for a good laugh go to youtube and type in Robin Williams Golf.  He explains the origination of golf pretty well.  Funniest thing I have ever seen.|`|G3hTM9qeaa	Scotland. GOLF = Gentlemen Only Ladies Forbidden|`|IR55acQBaa	Golf was invented in the 15th century by the Scots. <br>  <br>  A little know fact about golf: Golf was banned in Scotland in 1457. The reason for the ban was that the game interfered with archery. Archery, then, was a much-needed practice because the country's defenses depended upon it. However, the Scots continued to play despite the ban from Parliament and the church. The Scots played golf on courses laid out by the sea. These courses are called links. <br>  <br>  There is an urban legend that says the word "golf" stood for "Gentlemen Only; Ladies Forbidden." This is false. We know this, to some degree, since Mary, Queen of Scots, the mother of James VI of Scotland and who later was James I of England, was known to have participated in the "sport" of golf. <br>  |`|n42I1Fusaa	Bend over and i will show you dumass|`|CMuaKItfaa	Wasn't it Scotland?|`|AA11920142	Nobody really knows for sure.

o46KCxyhaa	The tension throughout WWE continued to intensify at Mohegan Sun Arena as the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania looms on the horizon. (Special coverage of the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania) On SmackDown, seven different Superstars interrupted the action throughout the night, employing treacherous ambushes, calls for justice, attacks of revenge and outright meanness.<br>  <br>  WWE Champion Triple H def. Umaga (Non-title) (Disqualification) (WATCH | PHOTOS)<br>  Although Randy Orton set the stipulation on Monday Night Raw that Triple H could not touch him without being provoked until their epic encounter at WrestleMania, that didn’t stop “Legacy” from coming after The Game this Friday. After The King of Kings had hurled Umaga over the top rope and onto the floor, Orton, Ted DiBiase and Cody Rhodes emerged from the crowd, stalking the ring like a pack of wolves. Once they moved in, the 13-time World Champion launched a fierce counter-offensive, trying to hold off Legacy both in and outside the ring. But his dangerous adversaries were unrelenting, finishing their target off with four vicious kicks to the head by Orton, leaving Triple H completely annihilated.<br>  <br>  25th Anniversary of WrestleMania World Heavyweight Championship Match Contract Signing (WATCH | PHOTOS)<br>  Before SmackDown General Manager Vickie Guerrero could get the contract signing underway, World Heavyweight Champion Edge demanded to know the true definition of her relationship with Big Show. But, after a heated exchange of words between The Rated-R Superstar and The World’s Largest Athlete, it looked like their match would become official. That was until John Cena interrupted the gathering, laying waste to both Superstars. The former World Champion then whispered something into Guerrero’s ear that was not audible to the WWE Universe, but clearly shook the General Manager to her core. Later, a very upset Guerrero informed her husband that she was moving the contract signing to Monday Night Raw, leaving the WWE Universe with more questions than answers.<br>           <br>  Montel Vontavious Porter def. Matt Hardy (Money in the Bank Qualifying Match) (WATCH | PHOTOS)<br>  Prior to his match, Matt Hardy proclaimed that even though his brother, Jeff, didn’t wish to face him, he would not be able to run from him. He vowed to qualify for the WrestleMania Money in the Bank Ladder Match, destroy the seven other Superstars and finally become a World Champion. But, much to his chagrin, his opponent MVP was instead able to further his new-found winning streak, countering Hardy’s Twist of Fate to score a victory over his long-time foe, solidifying his place at the WrestleMania table. However, Matt Hardy’s night would not end there.<br>  <br>  United States Champion Shelton Benjamin def. Jeff Hardy (Disqualification) (Money in the Bank Qualifying Match) (WATCH | PHOTOS)<br>  After missing his chance at Money in the Bank, Matt Hardy decided to bring the same fate upon his brother. Once Jeff Hardy had executed the Twist of Fate on The Gold Standard, Matt calmly walked to the ring without a word and delivered a single punch to the reeling United States Champion, causing Jeff’s disqualification. For the second time, Matt Hardy intentionally squashed his brother’s dreams.<br>  <br>  Undertaker accepts the challenge of Shawn Michaels (WATCH | PHOTOS)<br>  After Shawn Michaels overcame Vladimir Kozlov this past Monday night to win the right to face Undertaker at the 25th Anniversary of WrestleMania, the legendary Deadman emerged to accept HBK’s challenge. And when a video compilation of Michaels’ WrestleMania history interrupted The Phenom, the Superstar with a 16 – 0 WrestleMania streak made the chilling warning that he was the wrong Superstar to play mind games with.<br>  <br>  Divas Champion Maryse def. Eve (Non-title) (PHOTOS)<br>  Following Maryse’s victory over Eve with the DDT, Women’s Champion Melina - who Maryse had attacked from behind on Monday Night Raw - charged to the ring and unleashed her fury on the Divas Champion. And though Michelle McCool appeared to be staying out of the action, joining Tazz and Jim Ross at the announce table, her neutrality was short-lived. While Melina was busy with Maryse, the former Divas Champion slid her way into the ring, delivering a massive kick to Melina from behind. In the end, Michelle left both war-torn champions down for the count.

Ir7JA6IUaa	Tan doesn't go away that easily, so you have to prevent it.  Wear moisturizer with a sunblock in it, and reapply every four hours.|`|WBzoocIhaa	First off coon tans are sick<br>  but if you don't a really bad one, put your goggles up on your helmet on the lift|`|jTaW3goeaa	one thing you can do to hide it is wear sunglasses whenever possible which will hide your eyes and the tan, it will also let the rest of your face get tanned while your eye area doesn't and this will help to get rid of the goggle tan|`|qyATAaeXaa	I agree. That's a badge of honor. Your friends are jealous that they don't ski as much as you do. <br>  <br>  You can always get new friends who also have goggle tans. They'll most likely be cooler friends.|`|t3rmVomeaa	Any real skiier would consider a goggle tan a sign of pride.  Who cares what your friends think.  I guarantee you can ski better than them.<br>  <br>  Stephen, you stole Jims line.  Thats not cool.|`|MBlY3pw1aa	dude, ski tans are fricken awesome my friend! Make your friends understand, and don't let them see that you care about it. be proud!|`|Xec6WGMhaa	Haha i actually had this problem a couple weeks ago. I was out skiing almost every day because I was on vacation. And they were stunning, colorado-blue sky days, too! Anyways the day before I went back to work, I realized I had this really big goggle tan. So of course, all my buddies at work were loving it...<br>  <br>  Anyways, the best way to get rid of a goggle tan, I've found, is to put sunblock on the part of your face that is tan, and leave the goggle area unprotected. Then I just lay out in the sun with my eyes closed for a few hours. (You might get sunburned, if you do easily wear really light sunblock around your eyes).<br>  <br>  Its worked for me well in the past.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|DhKQYHmraa	Yeah, it's easy to make the friends who make fun of your "funny looking tan lines" go away!

VU6ODC5Baa	The Cavilers|`|khbLZQHIaa	Who do you think I'll pick...<br>  <br>  *Hint: look at my name*|`|meNI6vuyaa	Cavs.|`|qaz33UnNaa	The lakers have a deeper bench, not saying the cavs don't.  but think of it this way, the lakers may not make it to the finals. same goes for the cavs. they would have to play great teams such as the Spurs, Nuggets, Hornets, Jazz, Mavs, Rockets, Trail Blazers, or Suns. The Cavs would have to play mainly two great teams if they did Celtics and Magic along with the strong at home Hawks, and the Heat which can be explosive .<br>  <br>  if i had to pick between the Cavs and Lakers, I would choose the Lakers in 6 games.|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	L.A., especially if Bynum is back and in top shape by then.  They just have more weapons and a deeper bench.  If they can contain LeBron, there isn't much else Cleveland can throw at them.<br>  <br>  I also think it's more likely that they make it to the finals in the first place.  Boston is a better team than Cleveland, and Orlando is really dangerous.  All L.A. has to do is beat a past-their-prime San Antonio team.|`|JThgHiaoaa	La Broom and the Cavs wont make the finals...<br>  <br>  If they do, I would say Lakers... but I wouldn't be suprised if the Celtics take it out again...|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Cleeeeeeeeeeveeelandddddddddd! <br>  <br>  Wooooooooooooooooooooooooh!!! <br>  <br>  I get so excited. :)|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Lakers<br>  <br>  --If Cavs get the #2 seed (Which could likely happen), they will most likely have to play both the Magic and Celtics. Not easy tasks<br>  <br>  ---West has been somewhat down:<br>  <br>  -Spurs: Missing Ginobili, (Duncan and Parker has also had their share of the injury bug)<br>  <br>  -Rockets: Missing T-Mac<br>  <br>  -Jazz: Boozer been injured for most of the season<br>  <br>  ----Alot of things happening out West, that is beneficial to the Lakers<br>  <br>  EDIT: I read your question wrong (I thought it was had a better chance of making it to the finals). <br>  <br>  Cavs haven't matched up well against the Lakers. I would pick Lakers in the series.|`|t8JQJP7Xaa	Well, judging from the two games they played, the Lakers were able to prevent penetration from LBJ, and somehow, Kobe's D made LBJ miss a lot of J's. LeBron isn't exactly the best jump shooter, but Kobe probably has some secret technique no one knows about (hand in the face?) that hinders LBJ's shot. Kobe and LBJ will cancel each other out, so it will come down to role players. We know Mo will give you 15-20 pts, but Fisher plays good D so shooting percentage wise, you won't know what Mo will give you. Bynum (assuming he returns) will outplay Wallace or Ilgauskas. Ilgauskas can't post Bynum or Gasol, so he will shoot from the outside. He can't make that shot all day (as Phil Jackson stated during one of the games vs the Cavs this season), Wallace is a liability because he isn't tall enough to guard Gasol or Bynum. Joe Smith will give you that jump shot, but he can't make it all day. Delonte is a good defender, but he can't guard Kobe, and the overall bench of the Lakers is better than the Cavs.<br>  <br>  So basically...<br>  <br>  Kobe = LBJ<br>  Cavs Role Players < Lakers Role Players<br>  Cavs Bench < Lakers Bench<br>  Cavs Defense > Lakers Defense<br>  Cavs Offense < Lakers Offense.<br>  <br>  On paper, the Lakers should win, but anything can happen in the NBA|`|lbgoHgDkaa	Lakers have a better chance.  the cavs still need to get through boston and/or orlando, which will be extremely difficult for them.  the lakers should have no problem getting to the nba finals.  but even if it were to end up being a lakers vs cavs finals the lakers still have a better chance than the cavs|`|ks54akugaa	lakers|`|kjtF4kjjaa	Lakers in 6|`|QtPdrKfuaa	want the Cavs but they got to get healthy.<br>  <br>  I got lakers|`|7domw3t5aa	depends if the cavs get home court or not!|`|sDufaYGtaa	Well, my answer has some bias since I am a hard core Lakers fan. The Lakers will win because they have a better o-fence and are a superior team to the Cavs. Lebron has had sub-par games against the Lakers this season and the Lakers have been able to impose their will against the Cavs D. Kobe's leadership is enough to lead the Lakers to a championship and Kobe also has that fire in his belly since he has yet to win a championship without Shaq. Lakers get home court advantage and beat the Cavs in 5.<br>  <br>  Lakers 117 Cavs 99   GM 1<br>  Lakers 102 Cavs 97   GM 2<br>  Lakers 96   Cavs 95   GM 3   Kobe with a buzzer beater<br>  Cavs 106  Lakers 85  GM 4   Lebron scores 51<br>  Lakers 123  Cavs 109 GM 5  Kobe scores 63<br>  <br>  Go Lakers|`|p4szdxrCaa	lakers but u gotta remember that cavs have lebron james and mo williams their 2 all stars. but lakers have pau gasol and kobe bryant.|`|5HgTTHDwaa	neither, the celtics will win no doubt bout it|`|5MlBOuCuaa	Cavs!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gprdq8E2aa	Lebron will throw powder in kobes eyes and kobe will rape him... so yer umm they will have draw

Kobe right now, and Lebron for the future.|`|khbLZQHIaa	Who even cares?<br>  <br>  People will always say who they think is best based mostly on bias and opinion.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's LeBron.  But it doesn't matter because LBJ vs Dwyane vs KB never work.  We'll never know who's best until it's clearly (And I mean CLEARLY) obvious.|`|qaz33UnNaa	Here look at it this way:<br>  <br>  Skillful Now: Kobe<br>  Playing Best RIGHT AT THIS MOMENT: Arguably Wade<br>  Probably best in Future: LbJ<br>  <br>  Think about it. Kobe has the greatest resume out of all of them.<br>  <br>  Wade is playing his best basketball of his career.<br>  <br>  LeBron is only 24-ish. Look for Lebron in this Century not taking anything away from Wade or Kobe|`|SaeUxO6Gaa	James.  He's more athletic, a better distributor, superior defender, and strong enough to finish without a whistle in the lane.  He just needs to work on his mid range jumper, but that will come with time.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me, just look at the results when they're on bad teams.  Kobe and Wade's teams were atrocious when they didn't have top-tier centers playing with them, James single-handedly took his teams deep into the playoffs.|`|DNkavhfBaa	GEE THIS QUESTION HAS ONLY BEEN ASKED TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN TIMES TODAY|`|Qb5mffM9aa	As far as overall best player, Kobe...|`|m501HwyWaa	not again...ask me in 10 yrs|`|qLo6LSGFaa	wade is my favorite players<br>  <br>  I feel scared whenever kobe touches the ball|`|S3E3Z7vMaa	Kobe Bryant <br>  he is in his prime right now and can do whatever he needs u to do the the basketball court|`|piWK49fAaa	LeBron James|`|6yoQhXsOaa	Dwayne Wade.|`|gprdq8E2aa	WADE ALL THE WAY!|`|qtwYHyH5aa	DWYANE WADE|`|2YhigCnXaa	kobe hands down but wade has sick game|`|j6TvkT78aa	Obviously your  not a very clever person. or you would have never added Kobe as a choice.

On the other days, do 800m to 400 m workouts with a few 100's and 200's included.<br>  <br>  Do not only practice your events.

The fastest runners don't collapse at the ankle/knee at ground contact. Try leg presses where you lift the weight with both legs but hold with one leg, on ball of foot, knee slightly bent. Hold as much weight at you can for 10-20 seconds. Do 4-6 holds on each leg a few times a week. Also run short under distance sprints to practice running as relaxed as possible. Don't waste your time running long distance. That just teaches you to run slower due to the longer ground contact times.

1UID5JtNaa	Sounds like you tore some muscle fibers.  The worst thing you can do for that is stretch it until the pain in swelling subsides.  Ice, maybe ibuprofen, and no running until the pain subsides.  You might consider inserting a thin heel lift in your shoe to take some pressure off of your achilles, calf when you resume, at least temporarily.  Once you are sure the injury is gone, remove the insert.  (I have a hunch you are a toe runner- maybe you can also try to land more flat footed).|`|EVoMEQeiaa	that happens to me when i don't stretch. it feels like your muscles are about to burst doesn't it? well if it does i recommend to stretch before you run so your muscles won't hurt next time. hope this helps.|`|BB6HGbnPaa	You just cramped up.

There are different poles for the different heights people can go over.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|khycvTKWaa	Well Pole Vaulting poles are very expensive. They are about $400 dollars. So you probably do not want to purchase them. <br>   <br>  I would suggest to borrow a pole from a different school if your school does not have one. <br>  <br>  But if you insist to get one you will most likely get a 11 or 12 foot 135 because in most states such as California they will not let you vault on a pole under your weight.<br>  <br>  Hope you do well,<br>  Happy Vaulting

You are to tall for the bike you have and I doubt there would be a section you could race it in as I know there isn't in the country I am in.  <br>  <br>  Look around for a model a few years old but make sure you get someone who knows bikes to check it over before you purchase so you are not just wasting money.  <br>  <br>  There are sections for all ages and abilities in mx so there will be one for you as well.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Man, it's never too late to start racing. A 125 won't be as competitive as a 250F but the 125 is a bit cheaper and it would be fine for your first couple seasons. Then if you are still really into the sport you can move up to a 250F.

AA10863966	Hey Jak<br>  <br>  Lots of great hunting, big game, small game, water fowl, birds; hunting, trapping, and subsistence lifestyle activities are a big part of Alaskan culture and life.<br>  Alaskan hunting regs are pretty complicated, mostly cause Alaska is so huge and there are a lot of regions and sub regions, all with their own specific regulations by game type. And they are different for non-residents (and fees are more expensive)<br>  This site is a good planning site<br>  Hunt Alaska<br>  <a href="http://www.wc.adfg.state.ak.us/index.cfm?adfg=huntalaska.main" rel="nofollow">http://www.wc.adfg.state.ak.us/index.cfm...</a><br>  <br>  But you are also responsible for all the rules and regs.<br>  <a href="http://www.wc.adfg.state.ak.us/index.cfm?adfg=regulations.main" rel="nofollow">http://www.wc.adfg.state.ak.us/index.cfm...</a><br>  <br>  For each region / hunt there will be specifics about what is a legal animal and when is open season. There are both bow and rifle hunting, and choice of firearm will depend on what are where you are hunting. Specifics like draw weight, caliber, or legal harvest are all in the reg by region.<br>  <br>  Many hunts take place in summer, fall, and spring, where actually we are having lots of daylight, so dark isn't a big factor for many hunts. But rules state you must hunt without artificial light, so if there is enough light for you to take the shot, your good. <br>  <br>  As for where you can hunt, again do you realize how big Alaska really is?<br>  <a href="http://www.tongass-seis.net/media/tong_USA.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tongass-seis.net/media/tong_U...</a><br>  and that we are a conceal carry state? Guns, hunting, and land are all pretty big up here, so make sure you do your research and know before you go.<br>  You will need to study the regs for the area where you think you want to hunt. And then make sure you are hunting in a legal area.<br>  <br>  Also as a non-resident you need an out of state license and will be required to use a guide for some animals and areas. Also be aware there are specifics in many cases about what must be salvaged, for instance in some hunts you must salvage all meat before you can even remove the hide and skull from the field (done to discourage wasteful trophy hunting) or how you can travel in a area (some hunts are non motorized)<br>  <br>  Alaskans take hunting pretty seriously, and a violation of the hunting regulations even more so. SO be warned, do your homework. The Hunt Alaska site above really is a good resource and will have answers to most of your questions.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	Lots of good answers so far.<br>  <br>  I am a Certified Alaskan Hunter Safety Instructor.<br>  <br>  Alaska does not have one set of Hunting Regulations - the state is broken into more than two dozen separate Game Management Units and each one will have very different bag limits and regulations.  It is very important you understand the hunting regs when near any of the GMU borders.<br>  <br>  To hunt in a bow only season you must have passed an Alaska bow safety course or one from a state that Alaska has reciprocity with.  <br>  <br>  Pay attention to the Draw Permits that you must sign up for in advance usually in May.  This is the best way for a non-resident to get a good animal.  Winning a Draw Permit gives you access to a better time or area than a normal non-resident area and season.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|RRFbDou9aa	You can hunt moose, caribou (the rats of the arctic), muskox, bear (only with a licensed guide), and in a few remote places: buffalo.<br>  <br>  To my knowledge there are no hunting hours; the summers here are all daylight.<br>  <br>  The specific answers can be found here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.admin.adfg.state.ak.us/license/" rel="nofollow">http://www.admin.adfg.state.ak.us/licens...</a>|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Thanks for asking that question because I wanted to know also.*

zJC18FtAaa	Gets you stronger which makes you hit harder|`|6nGII584aa	no<br>  body building doesnt make you a better fighter.<br>  yes it can if you do it right but if you are just doing a normal body building workout it can be make fighting harder. i have one friend i did tae kwon do with a few years ago he is a body builder now and sure he is strong and can lift lots of weighs but he also can move as much because muscle in the ways and lacking flexability in places plus he isnt as fast anymore. also he can lift **** loads of weighs but a lot or techniques in martial arts move in different ways not always the same think like benchpress so they use different muscles.|`|SM6qHDKeaa	bodybuilding makes you better at bodybuilding. fighting makes you better at fighting.|`|dmX3zwbHaa	Different strength types and how to train for them<br>  Most sports will require some or all of the following strength types to be developed to one degree or another and the weight training program should reflect this. <br>  <br>  1) Strength Endurance <br>  The aim is to develop muscles that are able to to produce repeated contractions under conditions of fatigue. This requires high repetitions (15+) with light loading (30-50% of 1RM). Appropriate for field sports, rowing and martial arts. <br>  <br>  2) Power<br>  The aim is to develop fast powerful movements. This requires medium number of repetitions (6-10) with medium to heavy loading (70-80% of 1RM). Appropriate for power based events e.g. sprinting, jumping (long jump), throwing (Javelin). <br>  <br>  3) Maximum strength <br>  The aim is to enable maximum loads to be lifted. This requires low number of repetitions (1-5) with heavy loads (80-100% of 1RM). Appropriate for Power Lifting, Olympic Lifting, Shot Putt.<br>  <br>  4) Size with strength<br>  The aim is to increase muscle size. This requires medium to high number of repetitions (8-12) with medium to heavy loading (70-80%+ of 1RM). Appropriate for Bodybuilding or sports like USA football where increased size is a valuable asset<br>  <br>  <br>  Training Systems<br>  <br>  Simple Sets<br>   e.g. 3 x 8 with 70% - meaning three sets of eight repetitions with a weight of 70% of maximum for one repetition. All novice lifters should work on, because the high number of repetitions enables the lifter to learn correct technique, and thereby reduce the risk of injury this system.<br>  <br>  Pyramid System <br>  Here the load is increased and the repetitions are reduced (e.g. 100kg x 10, 120kg x 5, 130kg x 4, 140kg x 3, 150kg x 2, 160kg x 1). Pyramid lifting is only for experienced lifters who have an established good technique.<br>  <br>  Super Setting <br>  This consists of performing two or three exercises continuously, without rest in between sets, until all exercises have been performed. The normal 'between sets' rest is taken before the next circuit of exercises is commenced.|`|sjHX2IbFaa	Does body building make you a better runner? NO!<br>  You should train specifically for the sport you are in. You should have a work out that addresses the demands you will encounter when fighting. Pro boxers or pro football players don't just do bodybuilding and neither should you. Find a good trainer who can give you a detailed program. The right tool for the right job. Big and strong is always good but there is always room for improvement.|`|6p9I889Iaa	Bodybuilding only makes you look stronger.  If you want to BE stronger you need to do strength training.  I recommend talking to a trainer but basically you're going to do lots of sets of very low reps (anything from 5 down to 1).|`|QSsU9gxGaa	Thats one of the things.|`|BLWxEdrMaa	Only certain types of weight training, combined with regular stretching, can help you become a better fighter.  Most body builders are poor fighters, because they focus on size of muscles.  Size, in this case, counts for little, and can cause a condition called 'muscle-bound', meaning you can't move as freely due to muscle size impedance.  I recommend a regimen of running and other cardiovascular training, moving to running with weights (which makes a much more effective fighter out of you).<br>  <br>  The right kind of weight training will be high reps with low weight.  That strengthens muscles without making them much larger, and that's exactly what you need for flexibility and range of motion.  Do that while stretching for an hour a day, all parts of the body as much as you can, and you're well on your way to becoming the best fighting machine your body can possibly build.  Build too much mass and you're screwed, believe it.<br>  <br>  Good luck in your training.  I recommend a high-protein diet with low to moderate carbs while weight training.  Use multivitamin supplements sparingly, but use them.  Drink a lot of water daily, with little use of electrolyte-replacement drinks (like Gatorade or Powerade), such as 2 waters per every 1 sports drink.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Grandmaster David A. Moore<br>  Co-Founder of Ming Wei Dao<br>  Instructor of Wing Chun Basics|`|76iuxeLWaa	That all depends on what style you fight. I do bodybuilding and MMA, works great for me. People will try to tell you that you will become muscle bound. You will, if you dont stretch. Stretch alot, I mean alot, and work to be limber. If you do this before and after your workouts, you wont become musclebound.|`|P3Hec0Olaa	Well skill is much more important then muscle... to a limit of course. I'd say that if you have average muscle mass you should just go for the training, but if not paring is gonna be hell fo the beginning of it|`|rl0NfUZFaa	no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! look at Bruce LEE!!!
AA10380060	good question, but no good answer. since matt is a kicker a place in the hall is somewhat unlikely, most kickers who are in the hall played at other positions as well. I don't think anyone could ever take a thing away from Stover if you remember the Ravens won like 6 games straight without an offensive TD all their scoring came from Matt or turnovers in which the defense scored, so he was among one of the key players in their 2000 championship run. Its always interesting to debate if a certain player should be in the hall of fame and I'm all for kickers making it as well and most football fans broadcasters analysts etc. never give kickers (or punters) the credit they deserve since the general school of thought is "kickers don't matter" but let me tell you, the kicker sure as hell matters when your team is down by 2, 3 seconds on the clock in the 4th and ball on the opponents 20...in that situation the kicker isn't a player that matters, he's THE player that matters!!!<br>  <br>  matt along with morten andersen, gary anderson (2 kickers who are number one and 2 in all time scoring) along with punter jeff feagles may one day be enshrined but I wouldn't count on it at least in the next 25-30 years<br>  <br>  <br>  oh by the way matt stover is number 5 on the all time most points scored list, behind andersen, anderson, george blanda (he is in the hall was a kicker but a qb as well and played for 26 years!!!) and the one active player ahead of stover john carney who is 4 years older than stover but has only scored 11 points more. Jan Stenerud is the only player to make it to the hall of fame as a player who only played the kicker position, no one who played punter only has made it to the hall|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that he was a good kicker, but not the Hall of Fame. There is only one pure kicker in the Hall of Fame-Jan Stenerud.<br>  <br>  I think that Gary Anderson and Morton Andersen are ahead of Stover in line for the Hall of Fame|`|HPqCRBq8aa	No, but the Ravens should keep him. He does deserve that much. How could they cut him. I know his distance isn't strong, but he is one the most reliable kickers in the game right now.|`|UJZZ4bnLaa	hard to evaluate  kickers  they all play so long  and with  so little  contact its really unfair  to induct a kicker over  a borderline  position player|`|yikZNA7aaa	he;s agreat kicker don't get me wrong but no. If you put Stover in you have to put both Anderson's in(Morten and Gary) and if you put Stover in you probably also have to put David Akers in and then definitely Adam Vintieri (he might actually make it just because of his playoff performance). But, Jan Stenarud(already in) and maybe Vinatieri are the only two kickers who I can see in the Hall of Fame|`|zJC18FtAaa	No he's not a Hall of Famer|`|aRStsO3yaa	no but kickers like adam vinateri(when he retires) and morten anderson will definetly go, because vinateri won three superbowls and two that were last second field goals, and anderson has the most points scored|`|5etFAmrsaa	What!!! the Ravens cut Stover???
v5MP0KJ8aa	Before an athlete can play a sport or receive a scholarship at a Division I or II college, he/she must meet NCAA’s academic requirements.  Division III athletes do not need to meet NCAA academic requirements.<br>  <br>  Athletes who want to go to a Division I college must have at least a 2.0 GPA in a specific number of core courses.  They must also have the required SAT or ACT score.  ACT/SAT requirements for Division I eligibility are based on a sliding scale.  The higher the core GPA, the lower the test score required. A student with a 2.0 GPA, for example, will be required to have a much higher test score than a student with a 3.0 core GPA.  Division II athletes need a 2.0 GPA in their core courses and the required minimum ACT or SAT score.<br>  <br>  Most schools require you to maintain at least a 2,0 but I think some schools are higher.|`|VHphDgrhaa	at least a 3.0 or 3.2 i think. thats a B average or a little better if you didn't know.|`|QtPdrKfuaa	Most schools will want a pretty high GPA because they don't want the risk of you becoming academically ineligible during the year.  You probably need to graduate from high school with at least a 2.7 but 2.0 GPA if you have an exception. <br>  <br>  I know a guy who is a pretty good player but not good enough to get into a great school because he didn't have a good GPA.  Also his teammate is going to a good college while being the second best player but he has a 4.0 GPA.

PzF5adlXaa	Hah!  What a cheater.  The first WWF ladder match was between Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels at Wrestlemania 10, and Razon won.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Boy are you a noob.  Good job trying to use Wikipedia.  The very first ladder match was an untelevised house show 1992, not at In Your House.  The first In Your House didn't happen until 1995.  The ladder match between Razon and Shawn is mostly regarded as the first because it was the first televised.  Noob, go back to watching your "wrestling".<br>  <br>  EDIT 2:  Haha, aren't you an internet tough guy.  I grew out of wrestling a long time ago, youngin'.  Maybe you should do the same thing... grow up.<br>  <br>  EDIT 3: Why shouldn't I answer a question?  I can still remember the old shows, it's called nostalgia, maybe you should look it up on Wikipedia.  And when I said I grew out of it I meant that I don't watch it anymore because it has become convoluted crap.<br>  <br>  EDIT 4:  Nope, I don't.  I would like it though, so I could reminisce about the old days.|`|5b10ad51aa19e5de536116e3611c25b3aa	It was a Shawn Michael match but I do not recall the exact opponent or when.

e8Z2FVofaa	No chance of winning the SB.  Two words completely describe their weakness....  Rex Grossman|`|8Bu8pZbraa	Take Rex Grossman out, and put in a mannequin as QB. With this vast improvement the bears will at least go to the SB.|`|3N3g0atlaa	Well well well, The bears. Winning, uh long shot. Basically you have a killer D that only Baltimore can beat but you have to have a decent offense too. Thats where points are mainly scored, and if your QB cant take a snap, they have problems. Hester as a WR is raarded, Just because he can return, dont mean he can catch.|`|3e9768577c4d7cc51dc244221c948c23aa	The have a decent chance of making it to the Superbowl since they are one of the better teams in the NFC, but I don't think they will win it. What last year has shown is that while you can make it to the big game with a dominant defense you can't win the big game without a competent offense, and the Bears are still lacking that with Grossman at the helm. I have a hard time believing that the Bears will be able to win the Superbowl against some of the powerhouse teams in the AFC like the Colts, the Chargers, and the Patriots.|`|a43350ec23333f4fdc3a87408403ad7eaa	DEAR SIRS ARE MISS <br>  <br>  PRETTY PLEASE READ THIS OK <br>  <br>  I AM BIG BEARS FAN SCENT 1978 AND I AM HOPE FULL <br>  <br>  THAT THEY GO TO THE SUPER BOWL THIS YEAR TO GO <br>  <br>  BEARS <br>  <br>  TAKE CARE|`|pT2wPhT1aa	No I still think the Lions will win the superbowl this year. It's almost a guaranteed.|`|20zLmf3Laa	I don't even think they will make it to the Super Bowl, but just for sake of argument, lets just say they do. If the do they will most likely play either the Patriots, Ravens, Colts, or maybe the Chargers. I don't think the Bears can beat any of these teams, so my answer is NO they won't.|`|F4ynxm9daa	Hate to say it man, but as long as grossman is their qb, unless he gets miraculous better in a short period of time, i don't really see the bears winning the super bowl. if grossman didn't turn the ball over so much, they'd probably have a good shot at winning it.|`|HGDFiwbbaa	Thats a tough question, because their are so many teams that could win the superbowl this year, but they do have a pretty good but skecthky chance to win the superbowl this year. I think they have a chance to win the superbowl, but problably wont win it.  I understand you like the bears and i kind of like them too. My favorite team is the denver broncos who i think will  win the superbowl this year because they look pretty impresive and little favoritism every year for them becaus their my favorite nfl team.  I think my second favorite  team Dallas Cowboys will win the nfc championship, but lose to denver in a close battle.  I do think the bears will make the playoffs this year. i think their record will be (11-5) or (10-6). but I could be wrong about this to. the preason over let the season begin!|`|JsC3rThcaa	I say the Bears will return to the Big Dance again this year, the NFC is weak and the Bears is the best team from the NFC. Rex Grossman will lead them back to the super bowl, he'll do a fine job, i don't care what anybody say about him, he's a winner. And the Bears defense is one of the best in the NFL, and they gonna relied on their defense to get them back to the super bowl again. Watch out DA BEARS.|`|LIK2Ekmbaa	not with rex grossman|`|WGqsQWupaa	They never won last year, so how will they win it again this year?.|`|a961337c08b4db61daad86d1e3e8f7c2aa	they have a good chance I mean look at the roster alot of Miami players who are good

0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Im a Cowboys fan and they dont have a chance unless they tighten up the defense and the special teams.  Im probably the only Dallas fan that will say that but I always say the facts.  |`|aGNjZmyJaa	Not a very good one.|`|1H3IsHmLaa	The Cowboys shouldnt of struggled so much today against the Bengals. I have to say Maybe the Skins or Giants. My bf is going to kill me for saying that but I just dont think the Cowboys have it this year.|`|wfnQNIhCaa	possible if romo does something else besides passing to TO|`|PMSSoTqNaa	dude the cards spanked the bills today|`|toJS4otPaa	I think I'm going to be sick!|`|BwFZJ9Nraa	This is quite simple: NO CHANCE.<br>  The Bills will be far from the Super Bowl as will the Cowboys.  Super Bowl Champs is a big prediction for a team that hasn't won a playoff game in 12 years.  12 YEARS!  I was in like 3rd grade the last time they won a playoff game.  Tony Romo has proven that if he doesn't get touched, he can make big plays and win games.  But he has also proven that he chokes in big games and turns the ball over when moderately hit.  Hey, it's good that people keep predicting this, but I think it's the predictions that make it seem so bad when they collapse in the postseason.|`|0P71zlECaa	Sure they can be the champs, but they’ll have to get better. They’ll need to go at least 3-1 in their remaining NFC East games, and one of the wins needs to be over the Redskins at their place. The Cowboys need to bring their A game for the other opponents too. <br>  <br>  I think the Cowboys will get better but so will the others in the East. And at this point in the season, it looks like the winner of the NFC East will likely be the SB favorite once the playoffs begin.   <br>  |`|jYONAqi3aa	The way the Giants are playing, I don't think so.  And I doubt the Bills will make it to the Super Bowl. They're off to a good start, but I still think the Patriots will win the division and I doubt they'll get the wild card.|`|AA10292331	Im a cowboys fan but they have A LOT of work to do if they will make it to the superbowl. They struggle in the second half against the Bengals today, not good not good at all.|`|sGQbF431aa	Yeah, wait until the Cowboys play a team that should actually be in the NFL, then we will see how good they are|`|JfzoXl6raa	Ima cowboys fan but we got some work that needs to be done|`|62448d2c7352fb81b83c596f34ff9a44aa	No. The Steelers will be.|`|cWRls0mmaa	We heard same last yr, but NYG won. Im sorry, Cowboys need to show me they could win. |`|FgTN1jIOaa	I think its out of the Cowboys or GIants or maybe even the redskins  vs like the ravens or steelers maybe the colts who just need to improve in thir run defence i dont think the titans or the bills will last long in the postseason  |`|sA6xcrVvaa	Dallas has it's own hands in it's destiny if they do not tighten that defense and get romo to act like a pro bowler the saints will beat them again i remember i was there for the first beat down|`|RRfq35gJaa	Bills, im not feeling them like everyone else. Who have they played? Let's see them play pitt or colts or even jags. then we can talk|`|LIK2Ekmbaa	redskins baby. they just whooped your *** and phillys *** both AWAY. |`|77euWyX6aa	I think the cowboys and bills could be there.....if they buy tickets just like everyone else.|`|GChzA1U1aa	nope you have that loser <br>  T>>>>O>>>>|`|5u5Mqi51aa	ok|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	We will see. at least, they are in the right division for it.

4PAh98J8aa	Alright the first thing to do is set the ball more to the front heel in your stance to allow more time to let the club come around. The next thing to do is on the top of your swing make sure your right elbow (for Rights) i parallel to the ground to stop coming down to high. Then the next thing to do i make sure that your hips are not leading your hands through impact. If all of that does not work set a towel under your right armpit (for Rights). This makes sure that your club face comes in before contact.<br>  <br>  1. set ball more on leading heel.<br>  2. make sure hips are not leading hands and are TURNING instead of sliding.<br>  3. right elbow parallel to ground.<br>  4. Drill is to set the towel under elbow.<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>      <br>  |`|CBVlu3Gvaa	The Only known cure to the dreaded slice is lessons and practice.....Nothing else works long term.|`|b1eacc63c481ff40082f035f83d011d1aa	take 2 tablets and call me if it gets worse.<br>  If anyone gives diagnosis without analysis, that is malpractice.<br>  <br>  You have to know how to judge what you are doing wrong yourself to self correct. <br>  1/ Use a Video Camera when you go to the driving range<br>  2/ wet the ball to see where it connects with the club head<br>  3/ read golf magazines<br>  <br>  Assuming you have taken lessons from a Pro and have only just developed this slice, there may be many different causes:<br>  <br>  - Grip (too loose?)<br>  - Stance (Too far from the ball?)<br>  - Stance (back foot not level?)<br>  - Down swing / address / a butterfly sneezed in Asia ... etc|`|d0PFbP3Taa	The club golf professional is in business to cater to the member, to supply his golf needs, to book his starting times and to improve his game. This is done with lessons. That is where to start and you may see decided improvement as well as the elimination of the dreaded slice.|`|4045eeb32c4ef2d7acd08239fb1eff37aa	are you closing your club face?  what is your stance like with each club?  What angle do you swing the club?<br>  <br>  I agree with the other posts...lessons, and practice.  Your swing is almost like a fingerprint...have someone show you what yours looks like.|`|m0muVAXfaa	a slice is caused by an open club face in relation to the direction the clubhead is traveling. I suspect the error is in your grip, have a good pro check your grip out.|`|utngZDWEaa	when you swing try to touch your left arm with your right. It will create most of the time a draw, but if you got too far it could become a nasty hook. So practice and find your comfortable position.|`|AA11750512	As others have said, it is that your clubface is open at impact and it can have a number of different causes which only a pro could detect.<br>  <br>  One common cause (I am not saying this is your problem, but may be worth investigating while at the range) is premature and excessive use of the lower body in relation to the arms. An exercise I have found extremely useful when practising is...<br>  <br>  Address the ball with feet together, then rather than spreading them sideways as normal, step forward about six inches with your left foot, and back similarly with your right.  Almost as though you are taking a walking step forward.  Then try hitting balls like that.  The effect is that you must maintain balance to hit the ball, and it becomes more of an arm-swinging action.<br>  <br>  For me personally that is a really good way of getting the sense of my arms swinging through the ball with correct timing.  It induces a perfect subtle draw, and I have often thought that if it didn't look so stupid I'd play a whole round like it. And oddly, I do not lose significant distance.<br>  <br>  But as others have said, lessons from a professional are the only real way of determing the cause and cure.<br>  <br>  I had a series of lessons from an ex-European Ryder Cup team member who teaches here, and something also that he gets all students doing is hitting balls one-armed.  It takes time to get the hang of, but is another excellent way of getting the correct sense of swinging the arms.  I watched him play a whole pro-am round here one-armed after an operation.  He did pretty well!|`|6InJBeweaa	there is 2 solutions to this problem<br>  <br>  1. you club face is open at impact, and if so you are not releasing ur hands, so loosen your grip<br>  2. your swing path is too flat meaning that your coming across the ball causing a slice, so get your swing path straightened out|`|Z01uKX6paa	place the ball further back in your stance.  make sure your stance isn't open.  stand further from the ball.  keep club head as low as possible when starting back swing.  don't swing with only arms.  start down swing with your legs, then your hips, shoulders...|`|b3qQeuu8aa	i would say ur grip is too loose!! line up the club behind the ball in the direction you want to hit it then do your normal grip but tighten it up a little bit more but not too tight!!|`|bYnkvFz7aa	try this website, you can find excellent courses about Golf. <br>  <br>  regards,<br>

RS3fjNboaa	The Cowboys released some players that had to go, and I'm happy about that even though they took big salry cap hits from TO and Roy Williams. The downside is we lost Chris Canty and replaced him with Igor Olshansky. I'm a little skeptical about Igor. Also, we gave up our 1st, 3rd, and 6th round picks for Roy Williams the receiver. Things don't look real good right now, but at least they are heading in the right direction. I'll give them a C+. I know how you feel about your team. That sucks for you, bro.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Patriots: B+<br>  <br>  Cassel/Vrabel to Kansas for a 2nd round pick is good enough for freeing up salary cap to sign players. But the sad thing about it is that upon tagging Cassel i think there was alot of hope of 2 1st picks which didn't happen with the way the economics plays in the NFL right now.<br>  <br>  Then again i also think there are certain players the team should have resigned, Jabar Gaffney and Heath Evans.<br>  <br>  But even with the loses i thin the moves to get Fred Taylor, Cris Baker and Shawn Springs will really help the team this year and i hope for another big move within a couple of weeks.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	B.

When you can get Matt Cassel and Mike Verbal for only a seconde round pick. Now they have solved there quarterback question for years to come. And Mike Verbal already has upgrade the linbacking core on the defense. And this year with everybody healty on the defense they should be alot better. Its time for all the defensive players they drafted the last couple of years to step up and start playing good. But I think they still need a couple of players on defence and they need players on there offensive line and at wide receiver. They have signed players at these postions. And with the number 3 pick in the draft I can see them doing three thing<br>  <br>  1. Draft Aaron Curry<br>  2. Draft Mike Crabtree<br>  3. Trade away the pick and get more picks to fill the needs they still have left.<br>  <br>  Go Chiefs|`|pwaRd8y8aa	I would have to give them a B+.

Or is Winston Justice ready to be starter (btw Osi is back from injury)  <br>  <br>  My other team has signed another 3-4 End to play 4-3 end...i really hope that works out better than Anthony Weaver (who they just released)...and then they signed that Detroit QB who lost the game by stepping out of bounds on his own endzone!!! wow if he is our backup...our starter better stay healthy.. also they failed to address the Safety need and to sign TE Owen Daniels to a long term deal (of course he is restricted FA)<br>  <br>  the moves the eagles have made are pretty risky because of both of their injuries last year and the texans are taking a chance because they made this same move a few years back and it did not work...HOWEVER I am confident that both my teams can do much better job in the draft than they did in Free agency...Texans have number 15 pick and the eagles have 12 picks and two first rounders!!! so im still hopeful but disappointed in what has happened SO FAR|`|sCCUesFWaa	Losing Dawkins was a big blow, and they haven't made any weird free agent trades like we do every year.

Qz80EA45aa	Actually I'm not sure who is on-staff at Hendrick's that has crew chief experience. Is Brian Whitsale ( not sure of spelling ) still around. Of course, I'd love for Tony Sr. to give it one more go, but that won't happen.<br>  <br>  As I have said before, I would settle for a crew chief swap during testing. Take the 88 team, and 48 or 24 team to a test session. And let Tony Jr. crew chief for the other car, while Chad or Steve call the adjustments on the 88. Then we could get some idea of whether the real problem lies with Tony's adjustments, or Dale Jr.'s lack of solid feedback.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Tony Jr has a problem with race strategy..<br>  Darian Grubb is good at it, and Stewart<br>  is benefiting from the help..<br>  You may have noticed that Jr has been mirroring<br>  Jimmie's pit strategy, and that has worked to a degree..<br>  But last week at Vegas, he waited for Jimmie to pit, when Jimmie was running way ahead, and it backfired..<br>  The cars around Jr's position all "short pitted", and Jr waited for Jimmie..<br>  Jr didn't lose anything to the leaders, but he lost four, or five positions to the guys that "short pitted"..|`|vet4adaYaa	Only a total NASCAR rookie is going to think Kyle Busch's set up is the same as JR. and Kyle could drive JR's crap filled set up to first place.<br>  <br>  Eury JR. sucks almost as much as Theresa and DEI.<br>  Have a nice night.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Now!

But being a die hard Dale Jr fan, some of the blame has to fall on Dale Jr as well, he rants, cusses, I'm tight, I'm loose, Tony Jr makes the change, then it gets worse, listening to the radio scanner yesterday, it was back to Dale Jr telling Tony Jr what to do..There is a mass communication problem with this team. No other driver at HMS rants and cusses like he does, Jimmie, Jeff and even Mark they tell the crew chief what is wrong with the car, they let the crew chief make the call, it was a total mess with Tony Jr and Dale Jr yesterday, I call it race strategy chaos.

I have been to races and listened to this guy on the scanner and he is mostly swearing and blaming everything on everyone else but himself. If he was more constructive and asked for different things it might help himself and the rest of his team so much is lost when your screaming and no body wants to help you. I know he has a lot of fans and I am not one of them but I do feel justice is being served to him with where he is in the points standings. Tony Eury is a good Crew cheif provided he has a good driver. This is proven by the year Junior did not do well at all when he lost him. The question should be stated is who can get along with Juniors over aggresive attitude and low self esteem.|`|MCWdcrpraa	I think anyone would be better than Tony Eury Jr. He is only there because he is related to Jr. He bought himself a little more time last year at Michigan because he made the call to stay out and not get fuel. I think Jr. would be a lot better off if Tony Eury Sr. would switch over. He is like a father figure to Jr. and would be able to keep his temper in check. An off the wall choice would be Dale Jarrett. He was a very smart driver, and from his commentary he sounds like he knows how the cars work. I think a former driver would be a good choice, especially one Jr. respects so much. Remember Jr. spoke with Jarrett when he was trying to decide where to go when he left DEI.|`|esvq9xyxaa	Ray Evernham would be a good man to put on Dale Jrs pitbox.

xhPKkkELaa	Hi Kelsy,<br>  <br>  You can go anywhere there is an ocean coastline. I guess you could even go to the Gulf coast, if you are lucky enough to hit the few times they get waves. Anywhere there is a resort town, there will be surf shops, and surf shops mean surf lessons. <br>  <br>  Surfing is an ocean sport, that should only be practiced by persons who are confident and competent ocean swimmers, who are able to deal with undertows, rips, and sometimes very BIG waves. Even if you are a great swimmer, in a pool. If you aren't a great ocean swimmer, master that first, then get on to surfing.<br>  <br>  Lessons are the only sensible way to start surfing, either from a professional instructor, or surfing family or friends who are experienced surfers. There are way too many dangerous people in the water now, who THINK they can surf. Please don't join their ranks.The VERY LAST THING the rest of us experienced surfers want is people to take silly on-line advice, and go down to the beach, grab a surfboard, and go out and get in our way.<br>  <br>  Check out the link, and see if it gives you any ideas for destinations.

I1w0HfQbaa	There was accustion by fight fans that Seldon took a dive in the fight against Tyson. He was not even hit by a solid punch from Mike and he went down...hard twice. I believe You Tube still has this fight so you can view it for free. Bruce had shown considerable improvement as a boxer since his losses to Oliver McCall and Riddick Bowe in 1991. <br>  <br>  Seldon lost that fight, as predicted, but his effort was so pathetic and paltry given his improvement as a boxer for the last five years that fans never forgave him for folding like an accordian. The funny thing is, given Bruce's suspect chin I didn't think he was going to win but I did feel he could have given a good fight--perhaps a solid effort of five or six rounds--against Tyson before losing.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	With all due respect to Jeff Murdoch, that's not an accusation, it's a fact.

RsTm8uUlaa	I've dislocated one of my shoulders too, but mine healed for the most part with ice, physical therapy, and just strengthening it in general. <br>  <br>  Here's my tips and drills:<br>  <br>  Batting:<br>  1. Always throw your hands at the ball. It'll get you through the zone quicker and you swing right at the ball. Don't use your arms or shoulders, you'll swing late and there's a possibility of injury.<br>  2. Make sure the bat is the right size and has a good drop weight. You don't want to swing a bat that's too heavy, or you'll swing late.<br>  3. Leave your head down, don't bring it up. Watch the ball hit the bat.<br>  4. Wait for your pitch, if it's a ball or not where you want it, don't swing.<br>  5. Be aware of what types of pitches the pitcher has. Sit back on change-ups, don't swing to early.<br>  6. Don't grip the bat too tight, it'll sting your hands and give you blisters.<br>  7. Don't get down/lose confidence because of a previous hit.<br>  8. Know your strike zone.<br>  9. When you're using a pitching machine, chances are you're getting used to the speed and not actually watching the ball. WATCH THE BALL!<br>  10. Hit off a tee. If the tee moves you're not hitting the ball right. Hit the middle of the ball. The only way to do this right is by watching the ball.<br>  11. Soft toss. If you don't know what this is, it's when someone kneels next to you and tosses a ball in front of you, and you hit it (usually into a fence).<br>  12. Always catch the ball out front. If the balls over the plate, it's too late. You should make contact before it crosses the plate.<br>  13. If you're right handed, and you hit the ball and it goes foul to the left you're too early and if it goes to the right you're late. If you're left it's the opposite.<br>  14. Don't be afraid of a walk. I don't know about you, but a lot of people want to go up there and hit. If you're going to want to hit (like most do) wait for your pitch. Take a ball (or 4).<br>  15. Think single or double not fences. A single or double can be a lot more helpful than flying out trying to hit the game winning homerun.<br>  <br>  Bunting:<br>  1. Hold the bat out with both feet toward the pitcher. Hold the bat at a 45 degree angle upwards like / but at 45 degrees. You know what I'm saying?<br>  2. Don't chop/poke at the ball. Use your legs to go up and down and let the ball hit the bat and die off.<br>  3. Pull the bat handle towards third to bunt to first and vice versa. Never back to the pitcher or into the air. Try to get it down the third base line.<br>  4. If it's a sacrifice, it doesn't matter where the ball is, you have to get the bunt down.<br>  <br>  Throwing:<br>  1. Quick toss. Have someone throw with you and catch and release quickly. <br>  2. Hard toss. Do the same but try to throw it harder and at a good height.<br>  3. When you release the ball, you should be in a motion that looks like you threw the ball the ground. (But you actually released it, it's the follow through)<br>  4. Use your glove to set the target.<br>  5. No side arm. Especially for an outfielder. Yes it's the quickest way to throw the ball, but actually go through and overhand motion.<br>  6. Crow hop. If you don't know what this is, search for a video. This gives you more power.<br>  Strength/Conditioning:<br>  1. Run laps around the field, not the bases, the entire field.<br>  2. Sprints. Run to first a few times. Go back to home and run to first than second, etc. until you run around the bases.<br>  3. Lifting weights. Not too heavy, just enough to get toned.<br>  4. More sprints or suicides.<br>  <br>  In the Outfield:<br>  1. Have someone hit fly balls (off a bat, don't throw. It'll train your eye better) Do step 2 at the same time.<br>  2. Long throws. Catch the ball crow hop and throw it in to different positions as if there were different situations.<br>  3. Have line drives hit to you and do the same as step 2.<br>  4. Grounders through the gap (step 2)<br>  5. During a game, make sure you back up everything. If, in your case, the first baseman missing the ball and you don't get it, the runners getting extra bases. Be aware on snap throws (when catch will throw the ball down after the pitch and pick them off)|`|u1T5TQP7aa	see ball----> hit ball
wgWbm2zUaa	Frustrating!  One second it is relaxing and fun.  The next second it is giving you thoughts of violence.  Luckily, it almost always returns to that fun feeling!

3M4dh7Odaa	Go to Walmart. There is an airsoft gun labeled "Colt 2132(I don't know the numbers)" The gun is about $13 but I only bought it for its scope attachment and laser sight. The sight is actually pretty accurate once you get it aligned. Good luck!
