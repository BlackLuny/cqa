20090220032431AAx7o1g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 20 (21 in 2 days) and never had a girlfriend?	I have never had a girlfriend. Not one, had a close encounter with one last August but ended up not following through because I was being forced by two people I came to college with. And didn't want them to force me into something that I might regret.      I am now wondering if that was my only chance. I have kissed on girl but she was drunk. And it was just spin the bottle.       I have 2 girls that are like my best friend. I got them because my best friends were dating them at the time. I always seem to become a girl best friend when they are dating one of my friends. They even got me a prom date my Senior year. Had a great time even though she had a boyfriend. And it always bugs me that I can only seem to gain girls as a good friend. I will admit I am very SHY when it comes to meeting people. Once I get to know I you and all of a sudden I become a talkative person. I have seen my friends cheat on both of them. I have had all of my friends ask me advice for a relationship. And I give them my advice but I'm like why me? I do treat girls better than most. I have helped a relationship. But the question I have is, why can't I get into one. I'm guessing its because of my size (I'm big) and because of my hearing impairment.      I'm also not one to like typical thing. I love sports and I love weather. Movies are alright but not great. I am also great at navigation and Mr. GPS. I also know how to make people laugh and just have a good time. Not big on partying, I enjoy hanging out with a group of friends. I also hate jeans and usually wear sweatpants. Could that be the problem. I am just starting to think that I am going to the friend that ends up with a dream career but never has a family. (Going to be a sports journalist). I just want to experience what it like to have a girl. To have a girl that focus's on you most of the time. I am looking for advice. All of my friends have said I will find someone, give it time. But I'm starting to think that's not the case.

He kept trying to hold my hand and put his arm around me, he is a really nice person and wants to be with me all the time, he even bought me a valentines card! But I just dont fancy him, at all. I have tried to make excuses not to meet him but he just gets annoyed. Hes a nice person but there is no way I can go out with someone that I do not find attractive! Help me, what do I do, just ignore him??
20090220032540AAocNRC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend cheated on me recently with her ex boyfriend should i still propose to her this april?	My girlfriend has cheated on me and yet I was going to propose to her this April!!      Am wondering, should I really go on and do this?      When we met she told me she had no boyfriend and that she was happy I loved her very much because men in her past life had mistreated her so much and that she has finally found someone who truly values her and that she had gained her confidence back.             We are in a long distance relationship and we meet every 3month for three weeks.             She cheated on me with her ex boyfriend who she had live with in same house for 1 ? years and that he told her he’s sorry for how he treated her and that he wants her back. She told him that she had moved on (with me and that we are serious because we are going to marry) and that he should not expect to be seeing her again.             She has had 5 boyfriends in the past and tells me that he’s the one she had loved most among all of them.             We tried making a baby the last time we met and now am wondering if she is really a serious, because why would she sleep with another man when she think she might be pregnant with my child (that’s what her argument was until when I told her to tell me the exact truth and she finally confessed everything to me. She says they used protection but am now fearful that they may not have used condoms since the man would want also may be to make her pregnant- because he has done it to another girl before.)                    And if she finally tells me she is pregnant, can I really be sure that the kid is mine? (She has done 2 pregnancy tests since I left on Jan 19th but still says she has pregnancy symptoms.)             Please Note: we had sex 3 days before her periods and 1 day after her period and then I left for work.             She has apologised a million times and says she is very sorry for let me down and that she will never do it again.             She says he called her to his place and that she wanted to tell him about me and our plans and they ended up having sex.             Am devastated because, I’ve always loved her and all our parents know us and that we intended to marry next year.             Could the distance have been the problem? (Because she actually has a very high sex drive).             If she could cheat on me when she thinks she might be pregnant with my baby, how sure am I that she will never do it again?             Please help me with your advise!!
20090220032743AAKGCx9	Family & Relationships;Friends	Worried about chemistry when meeting an online friend?	I have met online friends before in a safe, public place and notified a friend where I am going. So I am always safe and prepared.   I have been talking to a guy on the phone for almost 4 months and we both confessed that we love each other.   He is absolutely wonderful.      however, I am kind of afraid that when we meet the chemistry will not be the same. Because I am a nervous girl and have anxiety problems. (he knows this)      I am just afraid that the chemistry will not be there and we won't be boyfriend-girlfriend material.      Any avice? have you ever experienced something like this?

20090220032639AAq2jvb	Family & Relationships;Family	Does my mum have unfair standards?	I'm 15 (a girl). I love my mum and all but I think her standards are unfair. I'm a good teen. I DON'T drink,smoke or take drugs. I have never shoplifted or been in trouble with the law ,have never had a detention,don't have a boyfriend. Heck I don't even go out at night I come strait home after school and stay there. I get good grades and have never skipped a class ever. But my mum seems to think I'm a difficult teen because I sometimes talk back and I don't like to clean my room. I think it's unfair. She punishes me and goes on about me being difficult when as far as teens go I'm an angle. I don't know how to make her understand. Sometimes I think I should just show her how bad I could be, but that would just be immature. Any ideas to help?
20090220032945AAQO3Ex	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you girls/women like a man to be dominant against you?	I am not talking about being some kind of control-freak, or bdsm and that kind of stuff.  What I mean is if you like when a man takes control and in the same time are caring and soft against you, that he  sometimes is telling you what to do, without neglecting his own responsibilities.

20090220033014AAHgA2k	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice, i dont know what to do, is he interested?	I met a man a few months ago and we really clicked. We started off being really good friends. Then slowly it progressed. He works away alot and i have 2 children so i only get out every other weekend. One weekend he stopped texting me and started ignoring me. I finally found out that he was ignoring me because it was hard for him and he had been hurt before and could not handle it. We decided to stay friends. Anyway we started seeing each  other again and texting again. Because i dont go out alot he still does and goes on weekend benders where i dont here from him for a few days. All i do is think about him constantly and watch my phone all the time. Sometimes he is really chatty and loving others i get paranoid that he is ignoring me again. i cant get himoutta my head. Is he interested or am i just there when he wants something. Am i being paranoid. When we together its soo good, but i feel like im only there for his convenience and when he wants something. I do go out with him sometimes.

20090220033436AAzK0wg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would it be wrong for you to indirectly woo a girl away from her bf and make her fall for you?	Lets say you meet a girl and shes in a relationship with another man. Of course honor dictates that shes off limits so you just act like a normal guy would and be her friend nothing sexual or suggestive just a plain good friend. But by doing so it eventually causes her to fall for you and you know its happening. Would that be wrong on your part of would that just mean you were offering something better and she realized she would be happier with you than with her current bf?

20090220033631AACft1U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	First Girlfriend - Help & Advice?	To start off: Why did I delete the exact same question and re-post it? Well usually if someone sees a lot of replies on a question they move on to another question as if their opinion wouldn't matter any more.      Alright well I'm 15 (16 soon) and I'd like to consider myself more mature than everyone else in my grade level. Maturity is not about being young of age. Its about being in control of ones emotions... always.      So I met this girl not too long ago, soon enough we were texting/calling each other all day. We both have the same opinions of basically everything, but you don't need to know any of that. She's the first (real) girlfriend I've ever had. No, that doesn't mean I like to make up imaginary girlfriends and crap. It means she's the first girl that I've been with that I actually have a decent amount of feelings for. (I'm sure no matter what age you are, you can understand teenage lust.)      Basically, whenever I'm around girls they're usually very outgoing and that's what makes it easy to talk to them. This girl, though, is very shy. Equally as shy as me. Now before you start typing "just talk, it's easy!"   If you were shy, you'd realize that it isn't. So save it.      It's kind of awkward when we're around each other, because we don't talk to each other that much. She's trying to be dependent on me to start a conversation, and I'm being dependent on her.      Now I don't want your "oh when I was your age I thought I was madly in love with every girl I went out with too!" because nope, I'm not going to just miraculously think I'm in love for no apparent reason. I'm not naive.      Now I know for a question like this I've included a decent amount of arrogant blabber which may come off as a few things like "I know better than you" but I assure you it is not. No, I'm not arrogant either.   I'm just tired of stupid people writing stupid replies to these kinds of questions.      I really like this girl, mostly because she's pretty much the exact female version of me. Once again, I don't need to hear "I was a naive child and I thought the exact same things"      This relationship could and most likely will fall through eventually, but who knows? Do you know? No, you don't. =]      So yeah, sorry for all the ranting, I get cranky without sleep. (Yeah, I didn't just wake up. I never went to sleep. Oh, and it's 6:02AM here.)      Oh yeah, and let me clarify this: We are already dating.

20090220033826AAdOVBO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Single Moms Dating Issues :S?	Okay so heres my story.  I have a 2 year old little boy, and I am a single Mom.  I have been single for over a year now and I think I am ready to start dating.  Although I have been on dates here and there, I usually stopped calling the guy because I was scared to get serious.  I dont know if I dont want a serious relationship, or I am just scared to be treated and walked on like my babys father did.     So theres this really great guy.  Im 23, hes 24 and I have known him since I was, I dont know, around 10 yrs old, I guess.  Hes very sweet, and handsome, and a hard worker.. but his work involves long haul truck driving all across the USA.  I really like him, and I know he really likes me.  I feel he could potentially be someone I would want to get serious with but it sucks because he is only home for 2-3 days every other week!!! He has a daughter too, who he needs to spend time with, so I would probably only see him for one of the nights he was home.      Umm.... HELP?!?!?!

Sal is really nasty. she is rude, selfish, $lutty, mean and manipulative (especially to Jas. she takes advantage and is SO jealous). we talked about how Sal tried to break up Jas and her BF cuz she was jealous, how Sal abuses us and takes advantage of her friendship with everyone.   anyway, on monday we came back to school and I was talking to Sal about Jas's upcoming birthday get-together. i told her how Jas had invited me and Sal was like laughing and saying "yeah right!". i got p!ssed and accidently said "u no Jas doesnt even like u!". but she didnt beleive me.   we went to class and Jas and Sal were writing notes. i glimpsed a couple of sentences in Sal's writing and they said "She said she was coming and i got all worried, but now i know she was just lying. THANK GOD!" then jas had written a couple of smiley faces. i told them i saw the note they got all worried and refused to show it to me.      so now Jas is backstabbing me?? is she really a friend?

I'm a virgin (I don't find it that a big deal), I'm not interested in sex or using women. Not bothered about that, I have better things to do like saving my money.      I've never had a girlfriend, hence the latter.      I rarely drink.      I've never taken drugs or smoked.      I've never been in a fight with anyone.      I rarely talk to any girls in my daily life (only on MSN but most tend to block me I dunno why?) LMAO the shallow buggers.      I'm a kind and caring sort of guy but I try not to show it.      I've been told I'm good looking. I dunno maybe for a joke f*ck knows?      I have a heart condition it isn't that bad; most girls who are interested in me tend to block me once I tell them for 6 or 7 months. LMAO even more shallow.      Well, I'm sort of introvert and a bit nerdy lol.      I listen to classical music, I know women hate that type of guy because he's 'gay' and 'boring'.      I sound innocent but I do stick up for myself.      Other than that, I rather money over women. Women don't have respect for themselves any more. Money buys you a house, car and food. Girlfriends don't :P      I'd rather money :P mmm... crisp bank notes and nice clean cheques. Women just waste your money.      I'm not having a women so she can have my money and then cheat, f*ck that!      These days women are a bunch of using sl*ts.       Money is very important to me, more than my family and friends.

20090220041516AAfaTBc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Stupid Girlfriend!!!!!!!!?	Why is my girlfriend is so stupid? She's mad because i'm not in love with her. I told her I have deep feelings for her, but that doesn't mean it's love. There's a difference.  She oughta be thankful i'm not one of those guys who use "L.O.V.E" to get in her pants. Why do women try to force love and marriage on a man? They threaten to leave you if you don't say "I Love You" when they want to hear it.

20090220035536AA5xj9b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do my boyfriend like me anymore?	So heres the deal,   me and my boyfriend have been dating for almost two months now and there are so many signals he is sending me that he don't like me anymore. When we first started going out, he was always with me, kissing me , flirting with me.. you know the normal boyfriend girlfriend thing. Lately he has been spending more time with his friends, he hasn't really talked to me at all barely in the past fews weeks, not even on valentines day that much. Im not saying I want him to be with me 24/7 because his friends are just as important as i am, but i would like to know that he still has feelings for me. I heard stuff in the past that he was going to break up with me and stuff but he denies it all . Also , on valentines day he told me that he wasn't planning on dating me for a long time, such as 6 months because that is too long for him in any kind of relationship, which i must admit, broke my heart a bit.. but I really do like him alot, and I have liked him for 2 whole years now. Anybody have any suggestions or advice for me? Im only 14 by the way, turning 15 soon.
20090220040637AAO8liu	Family & Relationships;Family	Husband had been made redundant, trying to work out benefits but the figures seem too high?	We have never claimed benefits before but due to my husband being made redundant this week we have no other option but to claim whilst he looks for another job.   I have been on the tax credits and job seekers site and filled in the details of our circumstances but the figures i am getting seem very high, i done it quite a few times to check and it keeps saying the same every time.      Does this sound right for 2 adults (married) and 2 children aged 4 and 2 to get...      Rent paid   Most of the council tax paid   Child benefit ￡33 a week   Child Tax ￡97 a week (for 2 children)   Job seekers ￡94 a week (married allowance)      I can't see it being right, it would mean that we would get ￡224 a week and still not have to pay any rent and hardly any council tax.   Surly families on benefits dont get this much money, i would be a bit pi*sed off if it is right because my husband has always worked every hour god sends and we have never had ￡234 a week left after paying our rent and council tax.   Thanks :-)

20090220041844AAiabyT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I told my boyfriend not to talk about a specific secret, he did it anyways, and he denies he did it?	Ohkay, so me and my boyfriend did something sexual, but not sex, and I know how guys are, wanting to say something about this "awesome thing" so I told him he is allowed to tell his bestfriend, Patrick, who is also my bestfriend. So I trusted him.      Then the next day, he tells me, "Hey, I told Patrick, but Patrick kind of told someone else..."       And my boyfriend said that Patrick told one of my WORST enemies friend, but get this: my bf lied.       He was talking about it with Patrick, and it's obvious he wanted people to hear, so he probably said it out loud-ish but like a "oops you didn't hear that" sort of way, IM GUESSING, and when my boyfriend told the lie he was like,   "Yeah I'm soo pissed at Patrick. Can't believe him."    And I'm like, "Yeah, don't talk to him anymore. He lost my trust."       And he "agreed", and the next day he was like, "Yeah I talked to Patrick today and we were playing bloody knuckles hahaa."      Then I thought to myself, "Whoah wait a minute, I thought he wasn't his friend?"      So after he got done telling his stupid immature boy stories I said,   "And you're still friends with Patrick????"      Then he's like, "Huh? Oh no I just talked with him a bit, that's all."       POINT: So he's denying the fact that it was actually HIS fault the secret leaked out, and blaming someone else for it, his "BESTFRIEND" and is being two-faced, to me and him.       What I Really Want To Know: Think, yes lying is bad, but if he told me the truth, I probably would've ended up breaking up with him. He knows. I get pissed off real quick, so would you say he's doing the "best thing"? I'm thinking about talking to him, saying how I know in a calm, nice matter, but the thing is, I can't tell him that Patrick told me. Because Patrick's afraid of my bf, and he doesn't want my bf jumping him, so he told me not to tell, so I'm just saying someone else said so.       Would you say he cares so much that he doesn't want me hurt, or he's just being sneaky and doesn't give a f***?

20090220040453AAhL6UN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Agh! Such a boy dilemma!?	So, I have been seeing this boy called Scott    And have been really close to a boy called Carl (but in a best friend way)      Last night Scott told me the relationship is purely a link up and he wants to stay single... but is happy to link up when he wants it...   And I was with Carl, and he told me how much he liked me, we were at a party, and we kissed.    The thing is, Carl is such a good friend, genuinely like the nicest boy I have ever met in my life, we get on so well, and are great friends, he's so nice and I know he would make a great boyfriend. I’m just afraid that going further than a relationship may jeopardise what we got? And I only want to strengthen it, I want to date him... I’m just scared of hurting him in the long run, unintentionally.    So, he was like “are we going to be more than friends” and I raised my concerns and he agreed, but said he really likes me, etc.    I sort of want to stay single, but equally I know me and Carl could be potentially great – everyone trying to hook us up too...    SO do I go with him? Or, should I keep it a strong friendship? Are relationships that blossom out of great friendships the ones to go for? I never have before...

20090220040511AAtEFuI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 20 (21 in 2 days) and never had a girlfriend?	I have never had a girlfriend. Not one, had a close encounter with one in August of 2007 but ended up not following through because I was being forced by two people I came to college with. And didn't want them to force me into something that I might regret.      I am now wondering if that was my only chance. I have kissed on girl but she was drunk. And it was just spin the bottle.      I have 2 girls that are like my best friend. I got them because my best friends were dating them at the time. I always seem to become a girl best friend when they are dating one of my friends. They even got me a prom date my Senior year. Had a great time even though she had a boyfriend. And it always bugs me that I can only seem to gain girls as a good friend. I will admit I am very SHY when it comes to meeting people. Once I get to know I you and all of a sudden I become a talkative person. I have seen my friends cheat on both of them. I have had all of my friends ask me advice for a relationship. And I give them my advice but I'm like why me? I do treat girls better than most. I have helped a relationship. But the question I have is, why can't I get into one. I'm guessing its because of my size (I'm big) and because of my hearing impairment.      I'm also not one to like typical thing. I love sports and I love weather. Movies are alright but not great. I am also great at navigation and Mr. GPS. I also know how to make people laugh and just have a good time. Not big on partying, I enjoy hanging out with a group of friends. I also hate jeans and usually wear sweatpants. Could that be the problem. I am just starting to think that I am going to the friend that ends up with a dream career but never has a family. (Going to be a sports journalist). I just want to experience what it like to have a girl. To have a girl that focus's on you most of the time. I am looking for advice. All of my friends have said I will find someone, give it time. But I'm starting to think that's not the case.

The night before we were so tiered and we were on the phone that he said just don't hang up and i said why not and he told me that he wanted to listen to me sleep and that it puts him to sleep. When I got up in the morning the call time on my phone was 7 hours and something minutes. Well last night the same thing happened this call was 4 hours though. We have talked about spending the rest of our lives together and his friends tell me that i am all he thinks and talks about. I have actually slipped up in class and wrote his last name on my paper. We are both virgins and we have talked about that issue to. He told me that he would wait as long as i needed him to. I am honestly thinking about it. We have been together for around 5 months now. I know that we love each other but i want someone Else's opinion on it.

20090220040730AAmOP4V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend being sincere? (i know it's long but i really need help..please read the whole thing**)?	When my boyfriend and i started dating for 5 months, he was faithful and loyal, he helped me get rid of the baggage i had from the past. however i found out he was calling another girl just because she texted him everyday telling him to call her. he never told me about this until i went through his phone and found out, and when i did he said she was only a friend and that nothing was going on. i believed him. after these 5 months of dating, he moved to another city, and it would be two month until i moved to a city near him. we stayed together the whole time, and i drove 6 hours to visit him a few times. but toward the end of the 2 months, right before i was about to move near him, we started arguing and broke up. i moved to the city near him to go to college, and started talking to another guy. it was obvious that all this guy wanted was sex, so i dropped him right away.       my boyfriend and i had only been broken up for a week or two. We started talking again, and ended up back together. it had been 6 months that we were together by then. time went by, and for 4 months i kept having bad dreams about him. i felt like he was hiding something from me, but he kept denying it. I found out from one of his roommates that he had a fling with a girl right after we broke up. i asked him about it, and he said all they did was cuddle. for four months he lied to me, and little truths about what they did started coming out. i finally just went and asked the girl what they did together. she told me they had sex. I asked my boyfriend if this was true, and he lied. I asked him again and again many times, and he finally admitted it. He tells me now that he honestly doesn't know why he did that with her. and he says the only reason he didnt want to tell me was because he didn't want to hurt me or lose me. We have been together for a year now, and we love each other. but i don't know if i should trust that he's being sincere...i know he's never cheated on me, but he didnt even wait a WEEK after we broke up to have sex with another girl. he even lied to my face once about the things he did with a girl in his past. about a week ago i went through his phone and saw that he sent his friend a message saying "i'm sick of *******" meaning he was tired of having sex with me all the time.       Despite all this, I love him and we want to be with each other more than anything..even my family likes him and his family likes me too. but am i making a mistake? has anyone been through this situation before that can give me advice??

20070210200045AAR31V1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I tell my best friend something?	Lately I haven't been in a good mood when I've gone to school, b/c I got turned down by a girl I liked, and my best friend always asks why Im in a bad mood.  How do i tell him that its b/c of how lucky he is to have the girlfriend that he does have...b/c I honestly kinda envy him b/c he has everything going for him in his life, hes smart, has a good, family, and a girl friend, when all I have is some good friends, a personality and a hobby, and that isn't enough for me anymore...but it used to be, and thats why he doesn't understand my mood.     I know if I tell him, then he'll understand, but how do I go about telling him without sounding like a woose.

20090220044329AAS9rkw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is he behaving this way?	Last night during an argument my husband suddenly grabbed me by the throat, pushing me backwards.  I had our 6 month old girl in my arms too.        He's never been violent in the 6 years we've been together, so this was a huge shock.  I'd obviously pushed him too far, not that it excuses his behaviour but I can see a reason for it.      My question relates to how he behaved after the argument.  He said he was sorry immediately and got upset, was crying etc, and he called in to work to say he wouldn't be going in that evening (he's a chef).  I assumed he wanted to sort things out, but then he spent the whole evening silent and moody.  I said that we should just forget about it, but warned him that if it happens again he won't see me or the children for dust.  He never speaks to me, just listens with his head down.      I went to bed fairly early and said goodnight and when he followed 2 hours later he got into bed without saying a word and turned his back on me.  He hasn't once tried to cuddle me, tell me that he loves me and that he's truly sorry etc etc.  The only apology I had was immediately after the incident which I think was more of a reaction than anything.      I don't know how to go on from here.  To be honest I don't think he loves me anymore, because if he did then how could he hurt me so much without showing any remorse? Surely if he loved me he would want to cuddle me and make sure that I was all right?      This morning was much of the same, he pretty much remained silent.  If I ask him if he loves me then he says yes, and that he doesn't want to leave, but he doesn't say it off his own back very often and I think actions speak louder than words.      Why is he acting like this??

20090220043234AAlU8OZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls - What am I doing wrong??? Please help?	Hey, well this is the problem...I'm 17 years old, never had a girlfriend or anything close to it, only have a few female friends and i'm not sure why? I go to an all boys private school and most of the guys in my social circle/group don't know any girls either.      I'm not socially awkward or anything, I'm in the top class for all my subjects, I'm vice-captain of karate at school, i'm in good shape (i have a 6 pack and stuff), i can play the piano (i've recently learnt "river flows in you" and i'm currently learning "Right here waiting for you"), - i've played at the opera house a few times too and i'm kinda funny.      The only problem i can see is maybe my height? (i'm 5'4 but still growing) But i'm not sure...I've been told by my female friends that i'm really nice, thoughtful and caring. I also try to be confident.      So what's going on!?? Is there something wrong with me?   Any tips for meeting new girls? - places? - If you say the mall, can u be a bit more specific on what to say/do?

20090220042719AAazlsn	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm just fed up with myself. Is it my fault or there's?	I don't know why but I hate myself cause nothing in my life is great like it used to be. My best friend hates me cause she ignores me and goes of with my other friend who I'm really close to, and it really hurts. I've been trying to get it all normal again but nothing works, I've even tried talking to both of them but the result only lasts for a day. I've made some new friends but they have there own group and we're not so close that I can hang around with them all the time. My supposed best friend is a right pushover which really gets on my nerves, she never cares about what I have to say instead she cares about what other people have to say. My friends say I've become depressed lately, and always keep to my self, but I always try to be how I used to be (jumpy and loud) but things are not working out for me. All this has been going on for a long time and I'm fed up. I don't want to go to a councilor cause I've already been once or twice and it solves nothing. I need help.

20090219225712AA5nVR4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok, I have been asked this question several times and want to get some feedback...?	A couple are dating and have been for a few months, the male is 40 yr old spoiled. The female is 42 and is a single mother, they have fun together but she feels that he is using her to gain materialistic items...ie he is not the one that does the paying for dinner, and claims to always be broke. ( he has child support to pay, and has a lesser paying job) She on the other hand has her own responsibilities and enjoys spending time with him but does not like to be the one that does the paying. They were in a sexual relationship and now that seems to have come to a halt. He calls and texts but if she does not respond in a timely manner he gets upset and starts accusing her of not having time for him and/or spending time with another man. Should she dump him or try to work this out?  And is it worth her time, rem they are not young anymore...

Who left you, or you left them, & they went on to marry someone else, and became: divorced/widowed/seperated from that person, would you try to court them again? I've seen 2 of my ex gf's on dating sites, and both are now divorced, after declaring they were "the one & only". Would you try to send them a "hello" message, or try to contact them? if they did this to you, would you accept it, and try to re-connect w/them? too weird imo. I'm a firm believer in "karma", and think alot of these things happen for a reason.      So, would you try to re-coonect with an ex: gf/bf if they married someone else after being w/you(and they're now single too)?

I met him the night i was turning 13 and he was so sweet the perfect chocolate brown hair pale green eyes and perfect toned white skin. We talked and he lied saying he was 15. I guess since he really liked me? then my friend stole his number which is no longer my friend and pretended to be me and asked for sex and she said oh he said yeah. I believed her at the time and got mad and told his job and they fired him and forced him to change his number. Now I feel really bad i wish i didnt do that. Its been 9 months since i seen him. Im one of those people that belive they can find love at any age. I think im in love with him and hes the one. Not just because im a hormonal teen and fall head over heals for every guy. and its not first love. Its true love. mostly america dosent care the ages of dating anymore look at justin and miley!!! america cares about money and business!!!

We started dating and she was happy for us until recently she found out she was pregnant and now she has COMPLETELY changed.

20090220035807AA0UCsI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: do you mind being called this?! how do you take this?!?	I won't go into the long history of our relationship.. just the quick facts are that..   1) him and I are really really good friends   2) neither of us have had a relationship before, but we probably both should have by our age   3) we've never hung out outside of school.. but we have many times at school when we didn't have to. i asked him to go for a walk with me once, but he couldn't, so he has promised to come with me the next time i go..   4) I'm pretty much the only girl he talks to a lot, you never see him talking to any girls but me. and I talk to a few but minimal guys, it's just the way we are. but we get along great      now.. onto the question..   i was talking to him tonight.. i won't explain the whole conversation.. just pretty much..   ME: "well good luck with that hun, but no one will believe ya" (i've never called him hun before, i call a few close people that, it's just kinda what I call people sometimes. I do in naturally, i just called him it cause it's what i normally would say there"   HIM: "Hun?"   ME: "yeah, it's what I call people :P"   HIM: "haha, i'm your hun now"   ME: "haha :P"      Pretty much for the rest of the conversation I called him hun and he called me this thing that I'd have to explain but it'd take too long :P      QUESTIONS: Guys, would you find it weird a friend of yours that's a girl called you hun? Guys, do you take being called hun in a specific way? Do you think it's a good thing he said that he's my hun now?      to note.. i'm sorry, i already asked this before.. but for some reason it got deleted and I don't know why.. but i didn't get to see any of the answers, so i'm askin again, hope that's ok

We are trying to find out what happens- with the house and things.  My mum has the kids- she has 4 under 18 and an older schitzophrenic that has to live with her under mental health orders. Our father has said that he does not want anything to do with the children- which is fine by all of us.   Question is mainly to do with the house- they have a joint mortgage. Some people are telling us that mum will have to buy him out, and other people are saying that seeing as she has all of the children, he cannot force her to sell the house until the youngest is 14 (the youngest is currently 7)   anyone been through this and can shed a little light for us?? Of course she is seeking legal advice, however we were just wondering in the meantime.......   many thanks

He accused me Of cheating when i wasn’t.. he didn’t contact me till 2months  and i told him 2 call me bk cos i was out.. he called me back and asked about my BF and said i don’t know. and he said hes not tryna get into my knickers he was just ring to see how i was doing and that hes got a girl and hes happy and that we can still be friends. I asked him why he didn’t contact me after we made up after the argument and he said i didn’t ring him and i wasn’t expecting him 2 do the same thing so obviously i know what that means. He said when he called me earlier i was with a guy and i could’ve told him instead. But I wasn’t with a guy. He then told me to look after myself and hanged up. Am soo heart broken it hurts so much.. Why did he have 2 come bk and finish me off telling me he’s got a girl.. i was finally moving on. I was loyal 2 this guy i never ever even looked at other guy when we were together.. Why did he treat me this way? What did i ever to him 4 him to be soo cruel. Am back to the broken heart again i was finally picking up myself and now he’s ruined it all 4 me all over again.

Have you ever just realized something SO obvious one night and you go to bed with your head high and fully confident? Like right now, I am realizing that I love my boyfriend who cheated on me numerous times, I love him even though he treats me like crap. BUT i love myself even more! and that I shouldn't have to deal with him any longer. I know that i don't want to be with him any more, but in the morning I am probably not going to feel as free as i do now. He is going to talk to me, and i am going to fall for him again. WHAT DO I DO to keep this confidence so that I can move on from everything, and finally be happy with my life?      Wow! I don't think I have ever felt like this before. Someone talk? Anyone ever felt like this before?

20090220024250AA7HIie	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MEN:::::women too:::FRIEND-LATIONSHIP QUESTION (10points)?	We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I he's not using me for sex...it was never important to either of us. We haven't had sex in a month, but our bond is getting stronger and the time we spend together is more and more. He owes me a little money (which I dont really want back but his pride wont let him let it go) I feel like he is the incredible person he is to me because of his pride and not because he wants to be incredible to me...which is bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"      The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for...I care, but I'm just trying to take things slow...even If he fell in love with somone else I'd be alright)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???         Also, we are way past the flirting stage...the smiling and feather touches...We spoon each other almost every night to keep warm now    If I ask him this question he WILL say he's my friend...talk is cheap

20090220001817AAFMIxN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do You Believe In Soul Mates/ Just Knowing They Are The One?	I have crazy situation. I met a girl who worked for my family when she was 14 and I was 19. Within probably a month I had the inkling there was something very special about this girl. I had never been in love before so I don't know if it was love.       The girl on the other hand seemed to have huge crush on me during the summers we worked together. Even my mom and dad tell me that. She begged me to date her, or even stay in contact with her. She told me she loved me a few times and that I was breaking her heart by not responding.  I was an adult and running my family's business while she was a minor who worked for me. I could go through with it.      We had a huge argument after the last summer we worked together. We didn't talk for about six months. But as soon as I was back in my home town she was basically stalking me. She would never actually say anything to me when she bumped into me just stare at me.

We like the same exact music, movies, food, books, celebrities...we both have a similar logic, understand each others thought processes, have the same self destructing habits, dislike the same things, and even had kidney stones at the same exact time. If you met someone so similar wouldn't you want to date them?  I was wondering why we never got together romantically.  I believe him when he tells me he loves me, but I unfortunately don't think he's interested in me in anything more than a best friend and I don't understand why.  Wouldn't you want to date someone that is exactly like you and understands you?  Or is it true that opposites attract?

20090220041946AA33Cda	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know what to do about this boy?	Okay. So here's the thing, I never get excuses to write on Yahoo Answers about boys sooo.. here I go.      There's this boy, well my classmate.. he's been in school with me forever since I've moved to the Philippines in Jr High. Started off from 7th grade and now we're ending the 9th grade. In the 7th grade I never cared for him, I thought he was weird. In the 8th grade.. it got better I guess, we don't exactly talk but we've both changed so we talk a bit.. in the 9th grade things changed even more and we did as well.. we talked a bit more this yr and got closer and things as such. Considering we're only like 6 in a class where I live right now.. I just figure I guess that he's always been there I just never really got to know him, but we've always shared same taste in music and blah blah and we actually have a lot in common. Anywho.       Now.. I went to a Fall Out Boy concert with him in where my gal pal was supposed to go to, but she didn't so I had to go with this boy and his brother and in one day it actually turns out that I got to know him a lot and I find him as such a cool guy!!!! The next day, I got home from the concert after being with him a whole entire day in a car getting to the concert and having the time of my life.      So again, next day was valentines and he hung out with me and my gal pal and he usually NEVER goes out without another one of his guy friends and we had so much fun and we talked about things we've never talked before.. and he has a girlfriend which sucks, but she's older than him and taller and it's a sweet relation, I know his gf I just.. idk. They've been together for a yr now and all of the sudden 2 weeks ago after I got to know him I've started to feel for him.. and out of all guys I would have never known about liking him.      We've talked about his girlfriend and he told me he doesn't date her or hang out with her, only at school but they are cute and such.. I just don't know how to stop this feeling or whether I should let go into falling for him or not. I just feel like it's so wrong but I know that his gf is gonna leave him for college next yr. We're 16 by the way.       Sorry if this was long, but please.. some advice??

20090203124051AAN7oxD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I love him but I don't no what to do.?	I know this is a really long question, but id really appreciate your help      Theres a guy, that i really like, i think i love him, i used to see him alot, but now not so often      I feel like i have a special connection with him, he understands me perfectly, and im always at such ease with him and i can just be myself. He always listens so attentively, and he has an amazing ability to make me fell bettter when i'm sad. With a few words he can change tears to laughter.   when he's gone i feel like part of me is missing      Sometimes i think that we were made for eachother - like soulmates. There was a stage when I thought that he definitly felt the same way, he took every opportunty possible to be with me and his face lit up when he saw me      Ok - so heres the problem - shortly after i became close to him, he got a girlfriend, he's pretty serious with her now and i often wonder if they'l ever break-up. I don't think she loves him the way i do, its driving me crazy. It kills me to think that someday they could end up married, I don't know how I could endure that.      I think about him everyday and it often brings me to tears, i really don't know what to do. It hurts so much   What can i do?      thanks  xx

20090203123333AA4HPrK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it odd that I feel kinda cheated?	Me and one of my old best mates go to different schools so we don't see each other very often, but when we do we get along really well. I was browsing Facebook earlier today and got a bit of a shock though - she told me as recently as last week that she'd never had a boyfriend, never gone beyond a kiss, didn't want a boyfriend etc, but on her profile she was talking about her boyfriend of just over two years who she'd cheated on but still slept with and all sorts of other things that contradicted what she'd told me before. She's always maintained that I'm still one of her best mates who she tells everything to, but she doesn't seem to have told me everything. I don't wanna confront her about it 'cos I don't wanna lose her as a mate, but is it wrong that I feel cheated?      Sorry it's so long

I asked if he WANTED me to go and he kind of hesitated and said, yeah I guess. All his friends are going and some have girlfriends that are going as well. He then later said that he didnt want me to go cuase he thought I would be bored, which doesnt make much sence to me since I have gone before and was not bored. Should I insist on going or just let him go and miss out on it caus e for some reason he doesnt really want me to go with?

A friend of mine who I have known for about as long. This friend I began to like just a bit more then my girlfriend when I first started dating her. So after about a month or less then dating her I decided I liked my friend more. Problem. I met my friend through my girlfriend. I decided not to do anything and just stay my path. Well I always felt that a part of me decided wrong. So my friend and I had big problems because we ended up enemies for a time. But then we starting talking again 4 months ago. Now I feel as if I want to be with her agian. Maybe because I haven't seen her for a long time or I still like her. She moved a while ago too. I don't know what to do. She is coming back in the summer and I want to see her but I have no clue what I should do. I feel like I'm drifting from my girlfriend and that I may like my friend more.

20090220011648AAiN2yQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on how to avoid sex?	My fiance and I have had sex more times than we can count... we keep trying to give it up for moral reasons (we're both Christians), but it's usually not more than a week until we give in.       It's really starting to get to me, to the point where it's preventing me from being closer to God. My fiance feels that we should stop having sex as well.       The wedding will be in a little under 4 months; however, we live together and have trouble keeping our hands off each other, so it will be very difficult for us. Anyone have ideas on how we can get through this??
20090203124233AAoHsrY	Family & Relationships;Family	I don’t get along with my real mother 10pts best answer?	My mom left me and my dad when I was 4. My dad remarried when I was 9 and my dad, me and stepfamily have been living together ever since. I’m 18 now and two years ago my mom got back into my life again; saying she loves me and that she’s changed.      I still don’t understand why she left us; the answers she gives me just seem like excuses. I do love her but I just don’t think I can ever fully trust her. I often feel she gets involved in my life way too much and I feel uncomfortable, but I don’t know what to say? It’s not as if I want to hurt her feelings or anything, but she almost acts as if her leaving me never happened. I get along better with my stepmom too and I know my real mom doesn’t like it.      Any one else who’s been through something like this? Any advice would be great!
20090220014251AAUbNqD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Women; is it wrong or do you mind being called beautiful?	I've been dating my girlfriend for about 5 and a half months now. Things are great with her. And seriously, i believe she's the most beautiful girl in this world. I mean, I really, truly, honestly mean it. Every now and then, I tell her, "You're the most beautiful girl babe." She says, "not even or noooo." And then she just giggles or something.   But I was listening to a radio show the other day and the host was talking about how it isn't good to compliment girls like that. Supposedly because then you put them way above you and I quote him, "You want to keep them at your level."And the callers were agreeing.    Don't get me wrong I'm not ALWAYS saying it to my girl, but you know, I let her know every now and then to just remind her of how beautiful I really think she is. So my question is, if your boyfriend, or if you were dating a guy, and he'd tell you that over a text message or over the phone, or in person when you two go out, would it be wrong? Would you trip out?

20090220011635AAqZjve	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I dump my boyfriend for these reasons?	Okay. Long story short, he's very flirtatious. My "best friend" is constantly flirting with him. He flirts back. Then my ex best friend also flirts with him. He has way too many friends that are girls. He walks up to them ignoring me and talks to them without even introducing me. He turns his back to me while doing this leaving me alone. He doesn't call/text every day. In fact, it's pretty rare if he does. He's shown up late to every date we've been on. When he talks to his guy friends he also turns his back to me. We don't have any classes together, so we see each other in between classes and at the beginning and end of the day. He didn't bother coming to find me today. When I saw him in the halls he said hi and tried to talk to me about my "best friend" and ex best friend and what they all were talking about in Spanish class today. For the three, almost four months we've been dating, he hasn't once told me that he loved me, or even liked me for that matter. He has yet to tell me anything complimentary, like "You are so pretty/beautiful/smart." etc. Not once.   Are these good reasons to dump him? Thanks.
20090220015109AAcD97E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ultimate boyfriend experience?	Hi ladies      During these times of economic uncertainties, I have decided to set up my own business, offering the ultimate boyfriend experience.  I'd like to run this by you, if I may?      The evening would start with me picking you up, about 45 minutes later than agreed.  I will bring you some flowers I've bought from a petrol station, or some half price chocolates. Once inside your house I will try to get into your underwear- I think this is what would be expected.  After you have told me off, I will sulk all the way to the restaurant.       Once there, I will complain that I wanted to go to Nandos- or any cheap restaurant chain- and decide on the most expensive thing on the menu- you, of course, will be paying.  I will flirt outrageously with the waitress and get annoyed that you don't find this attractive.  We will order a bottle of wine which I will drink the majority of.  I will obviously burp throughout the meal.  When you order a sweet, I will make a comment about your weight.        We will then take a taxi to a pub/nightclub- on the way I will accuse you of flirting with the taxi driver and cause a scene.  I will do the same with the bouncer/barman/ any male that looks at you in the pub/club.  I will drink copious amounts of beer and vodka redbulls, refuse to dance and keep putting my hands on your bum.  You will get annoyed with this, and I will shout at you and show you up in front of all your friends.        After the club we will go to a kebab shop, where I will try to pick a fight with all the men in there, as you are obviously flirting with them all.  I will choose the kebab that smells and looks the most disgusting, and pour the whole bottle of chilli sauce over it so I can look really hard. We will then take a taxi back to your place, where I will raid your fridge for more alcohol, eat the chocolates that I bought you, and watch sport on the tv.  I will beg you for sex, and settle for a hand job.  I will then call you a frigid cow.       Staying the night will cost more.  I think ￡250.00 for the whole night will be about right.       I expect demand to be high for this service, so please book early to avoid disappointment.

20090220011422AAiKjjf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How does a serious relationship last through Med School? Is it possible?	I love my boyfriend of almost 8 months. I am 18 he is 19.   We both are going to college and then plan on going to dental school.   Lately he has been telling me how busy he is going to be for the next 10 years and has began to talk less and less to me to basically prepare us for whats coming because he doesn't want anything interfering with his career.      However, he also just told me I am the first serious relationship he has had/first one he has ever committed. He loves me i love him etc..      We want to be together, we've discussed career plans, even marriage.    We haven't had sex, we are waiting till marriage.      ----------      So During College/Dental School how hard is it to have a relationship? A serious one like mine? Where you do want to get married.      What about getting married after getting a college degree then going to Med school together.      Can a relationship last through these kind of schooling or will school take up that much time that you can't even talk to your lover once a week??      PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE HELP.

Oh man this is kinda long but hear me out !      my gf got laid off and looks for jobs every other day ( because she takes care of her son the other days )       Well her dad or brother will take her ( we only have 1 car and i need it at work for work )       I feel like she is having to much fun out there looking and not really trying her 150%.      I just feel like her not working right now is making me upset like im starting to think wow it must be nice to watch csi all day or something .       I even make little comments and she will say oh ya because i choose to get laid off.       Yes I know it wasn't her fault but im paying for everything and its getting hard and taking its toll on me !      How can I make it that im more supportive and not so bitchy about it. I even make her a list of places I want her to go apply .       In my mind i start to think oh what if she isn't even looking or trying just hanging out with family & friends when im over hear stressing like mad !         breaking up or kicking her out isn't an option so avoid that advice.       What are some jobs or things I could have her do to even bring in like 100 bucks a month.      thanks =)
20090220020315AAgN9mj	Family & Relationships;Friends	What is my best friend's problem? Is she even a good friend?	Okay, so I've been friends with this girl since the beginning of sec. school, along with this other girl, who's really nice. We were best friends for that first year and second (I'm now in third), but we were rather strange. We were really really good friends, but we were always rather immature together, and never did "proper" girly things together, just weird stuff. But we trusted each other and stuff. It was just the 3 of us. It was great. But then in 3rd year (8th grade) , my "best friend" and I were put in the same class, whilst the other friend was put in a different class. She now doesn't spend much time with us anymore...      I made new friends in my new class, because there were more new girls and stuff. But because I had ALWAYS done EVERYTHING with my "best friend", she found it weird. The thing is though, because we were all "weird" together, we never did girly things, and we never "opened up" or anything, we just laughed and had fun. She always laughed at me, but we did get annoyed with each other every so often.   I made a new friend in the new class, 2 new friends in fact, and my "best friend" started getting jealous and moody. She badmouthed my new friends and all that, because if you didn't know my new friends, you would think they're strange.   My "best friend" always wanted to be with me, but she always sooo moody!! Like she always wanted to copy my homework, but when I couldn't find it she started swearing at me!!!!!!   Now my "best friend" tried to become better friends with my new friends (even though she's annoying), but she's more likeable than me - meaning she's less awkward, but more friendly, whilst I am shy, and only confident around people I know. We went to my new friend's house, and I found that my "best friend" got on better with her than I did!!! The new girl is more girly, and she can actually talk about clothes and stuff and all that with us, even with my "best friend" more, even though I've always felt I was the one who wanted to be more "girly" than my "best friend".    I just don't understand WHY she has to deliberatley... I don't know. I can tell that my "best friend" and I have stopped being so close, and are more moody with each other, but why does she have to hang out with someone she didn't like initially until she insisted on hanging aroudn with me and them?
20090203123235AAhrFEu	Family & Relationships;Friends	HEY!!!!plz answer this....?	Okay. Theres this guy that asked me out last year, and I didn't answer him for a long time, cause I didn't want to say no and hurt his feelins or nothin. Well I was about to say yes, when he started dating my friends sister.....then after that him and one of my other friends dated him......they broke up like 5 months ago, and I talk to him some. My friend Megan (never dated him) sits beside me in class, and he sits behind me. We talk all the time and I laugh alot cause he's really funny, and she thinks we're flirting....but she also thinks that about everyone....there is this other girl, Kensey, that he talks to also. She hasn't been here at all this week, so we've been talking alot. When she's here, he talks to her, and when he talks to me, she has to get his attention, all the time. She's also dating someone. So any advice???

20090219234240AA1G8Lm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend came back from the dead?	5 years ago i was dating this guy an we were very serious we were planning to get married.  then all of the sudden he just completely disappeared,(he went on vacation to see his family in another state and never cam back!) it really hurt me. no calls, emails nothing. I later heard that he had gotten married with a girl2 years later  i had just heard rumors that he had gotten married from one of his cousins whom i really don't talk to at all.. So i couldn't actually go to her to ask her what happened with her cousin since they didn't even know we were dating, After that i never heard about him again.i cried everyday cuz it hurt that he disapeared and then next thing you know hes married.   now im engaged and will get married in june. but wat do you know? all of the sudden i get an Instant message from him. im like OMG!!!hes tells me it was an arranged marriage and that he still hasn't had sex with his wife because all this time he has been thinking about him. hes bumbed out cuz im getting married and he feel i forgot him very fast. im like duh you left and got married and switched yet u wanted me to wait for you. He claims he didnt switch me, that it was arranged. so he wants to leave his wife and come and steal me away. but why after 5 years? he never told me anything, he was as good as dead.     all this is weird cuz arranged marriages are not part of his family customs. hes Mexican!!!! plus y after 5 years does he contact me.   i think hes just unhappy with his marriage and want out now. he wants to start again. i don't know. i mean im sure i want to marry my now fiance and all this doesn't change my feelings at all, but im just curious why do guys think we'll always be waiting.
20090220035257AAP5oP8	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do you think of people who always make themselves seem like a victim? Help!?	I have a friend, and we were quite close at one time.    But over time, she kept on complaining and ranting about people in her life and how they mistreat her.    The thing is, she rants about her friends behind their backs, so naturally I'm scared that she's doing the same about me.       She also tends to pit people against each other. For example I once blew up at this guy for being mean to her so he ran off and cried. She followed after him and told him I was heartless even though she was the one who made me yell at him. Since then our relationship has never been the same.    I just can't trust her.       I don't know what to do... I'm scared that she might be turning common friends against me.       Have any of you been through the same experience?

20090203122642AAyCCsy	Family & Relationships;Family	Was it my fault or hers?	I have been babysitting my baby nephew while my Sister-In-Law works. In return, she picks up my son from preschool. Today I got a call from his teacher asking me why no one picked him up. My SIL wound up getting him, but 20 minutes late.  I haven't consistently watched her son, but I thought this was the system. The only reason I feel it could have been my fault was that I didn't confirm with her that she was getting him.    FYI: I could pick up my son, but between my two boys and my nephew it is more convenient that mine gets a ride.

20090220014905AARnZV9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong to break up through messaging?	So here's the deal - I want to break up with this guy, we've only been going out about 10 days or so. & I regret going out with him. We barely know each other, & we rushed into things. So things are still very awkward between us. We're soooo different, we barely talk. So that's why I want to break up.   Except we talk on Myspace all the time. That's practically our relationship.   So is it wrong to break up through a message?    I know I've been broken up with by message before. Honestly, it sucks for a few days but I got over it.   I just want to end it NOW - I don't want to drag it on any longer. & I want to do it during the weekend, so we don't have to see each other right after. That seems worse to me.   So is it okay to break up with him through a message? Or am I just a *****?      btw, we're both fifteen.

Anyway he's in a big mood with me, he think si should say sorry to him and if I don't like it pack my bags and leave.      if he had just said sorry ill get rid of the account, fine I would've forgotten about it. It's the fact he's being so mean to me and telling me it's all my fault.      Should I be apologising to him? If so what should I say
20090220000651AAq2g7c	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I find this kind of weird. (10 points for best answer)?	Is it weird if there is a group of 6 lesbians at my friends high school are all best friends with each other? They're all pretty feminine and very pretty and you wouldn't think any of them are gay. Two of them are dating each other, two of them are dating butchy looking girls and one is dating this really pretty girl. The other one is jokingly known as the group whore and is VERY girly and no one would ever guess shes gay. She just started dating a really pretty asian girl. Is it weird that theyre all friends with each other and do you think some of them arent really gay because theyre only 16-17 years old.

20090220035159AAhOqa0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need help as to what is going on?	We are friends/group mates. we work on things together, speak to each other in class sometimes. he always looks at me when we are speaking, even when others are.ive caught him staring when i walked into the class and sometimes in class but i could be dreaming.what's worse is, sometimes the both of us have prolonged eye contact. it is very daunting and very awkward for me as he is able to hold like 3-5 sec eye contact without looking away. and sometimes he does it smiling.       He's quite gentlemanly and seems to notice that i'm usually not paying attention in class. When he speaks to me, he seems to sound more gentle but he doesnt ask me personal stuff when we're alone but more sch qns.In a group where my good male friend is, he doesnt look at me much..      and when i did accidentally touch his hand today, he didnt move it away. and he swivelled his chair to look at me a few times though i wasnt speaking (was beside him). anyways as a result im shy, quiet and self-conscious and am afraid of smiling (i dont think i look nice).      what is going on and how do i get pass my awkward behavoiur? we're both in college. thanks!

20090220020919AAn0Ct6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	IS THIS NORMAL?..........?	how common is it for people to not think they are attractive? i look at myself and think im not good looking, yet other people say i am..   i feel self concious of my looks, because i am not blonde, skinny, or have delicate features. i have an ethnic background so i have a very obvious look...dark hair etc.
20090220024222AAJEhbI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think and any advice?	There are a few things you should know about me first.   I am in year 10, am 14 years old and I go to a grammar school.   All my friends know loads and loads of boys and I only know two.   I, myself, feel that i wouldn't want a boyfriend until i was around 20.   This is because I don't see the point in having a boyfriend at the age of 14, not marrying him and having to deal with the eventual heartbreak.   But a little part of me wishes I had one, someone to care and love me a different way to my friends and family.   The boys i know or know of don't tend to go for girls like me.   I am the sort of girl who is different from the rest.    I don't like clubbing. I would rather stay in to do my maths homework.   I won't straighten my hair and be a  sheep following everyone else.   I won't use ridiculous languages like "alie" and "skeen"   and I speak A LOT instead of acting all "mysterious".   I don't even know if any guy I like will ever ask me out, even when i'm older.   I know this isn't really a question but if you have any advice for me it would be greatly appreciated.   thankyou :)   x

20090220035744AAPWSvO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I want to be with my mom ex-husband?	Okay my best friends wants to be with her moms ex-husband and sees nothing wrong with it.  When her mom separated with him, the guy came to see her just 1 week after and said he has always seen her as a good person and wanted to be with her.   I just recently found out she was pregnant by him but ended up losing the baby.  She says they love each other and he loves her daughter and wants to start a family with her.  Now this is not her biological father but her step-dad. She says her daughter really love him and wants him around.  Does anyone else find this to be disgusting?  This man use to sleep with her mom and now wants to be with her.  She also said her therapist said that its not their place to judge the morality of the situation and their relationship has not crossed any legal boundaries.  Am I wrong for telling her to get out of the relationship?
20090220035826AAkQF0R	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would this be an ok birthday present?	My boyfriend's 29th birthday is coming up. We don't have a lot of money to spend right now because we're trying to save up to live together, so he doesn't expect anything big.      I wanted to get him a nice wooden keepsake box with his initials engraved on it if possible. Inside I was going to put the birthday card, and two wallet sized pictures (one of me, and one of our cat). He has wanted a pic of me for his wallet for a long time, but I kept forgetting it. He only has a tiny pic of his two old cats in there right now, so I thought one of our kitty might also be nice to add to that.      Does that sound ok? Is there anything else I could put in there?   I know it's not much, but I wanted it to be something he could use that's also a bit special.

20090220022856AAtqyBs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people (women) insult my lifestyle?	It's not like I insult their whorish lifestyles?      I'm a 19 y/o guy.      I never kissed, hugged or held hands with a woman. I'm a virgin (I don't find it that a big deal), I'm not interested in sex or using women. Not bothered about that, I have better things to do.      I've never had a girlfriend, hence the latter.      I rarely drink.      I've never taken drugs or smoked.      I've never been in a fight with anyone.      I rarely talk to any girls in my daily life (only on MSN but most tend to block me I dunno why?) LMAO the shallow buggers.      I'm a kind and caring sort of guy but I try not to show it.      I've been told I'm good looking. I dunno maybe for a joke f*ck knows?      I have a heart condition it isn't that bad; most girls who are interested in me tend to block me once I tell them for 6 or 7 months. LMAO even more shallow.      Well, I'm sort of introvert and a bit nerdy lol.      I listen to classical music, I know women hate that type of guy because he's 'gay' and 'boring'.      I sound innocent but I do stick up for myself.      Other than that, I rather money over women. Women don't have respect for themselves any more. Money buys you a house, car and food. Girlfriends don't :P      I'd rather money :P mmm... crisp bank notes and nice clean cheques. Women just waste your money.      I'm not having a women so she can have my money and then cheat, f*ck that!       These days women are a bunch of using sl*ts.
20090220035454AA1hbXD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this a rebound marriage?	I have an ex gf who seemingly, in less than a yr and a half, dumped me(after 3 and a half years + telling me she"loved me and wanted to spend the rest of her life w/me", move away, then to another state 3 months later, and get married to someone else within a year. W/no closure & many questions still lingering over the breakup, do you think she did all of this as a "rebound"? I mean, the timing of it all was weird. I think it is...and so do many of my friends, both married and unmarried. Do "rebound" marriages work out, or do they usually fail?

I am a step mother and have been for almost 10 years ... my step children have lived with my husband and myself the entire time. I have been their 'mother'. Their mom has been absent in their life for the entire time. I am currently wanting to leave my husband but feel obligated to stay because of my step children.

I need to be loved which I don't feel I am getting. I am not 'in love' with my husband but I am with his children and don't want to leave because of them but feel I need to...is that being selfish?

20090220042200AA7kxdH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is My Girlfriend Over Her Ex?	I am with my girlfriend its been 6 months and its been fantastic one problem at the start she left me because she was not sure n started getting in touch with her ex which she was with for 2 years but he cheated on her alot so she left him. i found out he was calling texting every min of the day. anyway we got back together and she said she would not speak to him. a few months down the line i find she is hiding something and has lied to me about talking to him despite asking her again she promises. now back today she is demanding to talk to him and is willing to not be with me if i dont let her talk to her ex because he is a "good Friend" i dont see how when someone cheats on you hits on your best friends loads of times he can be a good friend worth more than your boyfriend. He was always telling her not to get with me and trying to get her to work in a local night club with him after seconds of starting communication again i mean surely he wud ask his friends first ? i found out she was not telling me truth again yesterday and she has been talking to him and he is asking her the same. she swears he dont like her anymore but she has said it before and the signs are there so now im in the position let her talk or she is leaving me does anybody have any views =[

Can you give me another way of looking at things?      I have quite the problem at the moment. I've set my standards too high, and I can't seem to lower them. I think the problem is that I have the image of a perfect person in my head, but nobody I know is like that at all. And I know that everyone has their imperfections, but right now it seems like there's nobody that isn't too shallow, or dumb, or whatever.      I really need another, more positive view on these people, because if I don't, I'm gonna be a virgin for the rest of my life!!      NOOOO!

20090219231907AAU0zA4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Male body language and behaviour?	Okay, so I like this guy at my school. We  catch the same bus every morning, and today for the first time we got into a pretty long conversation. It's almost as if someone told him how I felt and he was responding. He asked me a lot about myself and it was great. However, at one point, he asked me how old I was, and it turned out I was maybe nine months older. After this, he said 'Sorry, I'm too young for you'.      This confused me a lot, because:    1. I don't think anyone told him how I felt, and we were talking about completely normal things. Maybe it was just obvious to him that I liked him?   2. Later on, we had first period together, and he asked me to sit next to him and kept talking to me. Then at lunch, he walked me all the way to where I sit with my friends.       I cannot tell if this guy likes me or is just messing with my head.    Why would he say that and then act like he's interested? Could the remark have been sarcastic?      Any opinions would be appreciated.

Do you like a guy who give you a potrait drawing of yourself , which he's been drawing while waiting for the bus, etc. ,which has his phone# or email address?   How would you like a guy flirt at you? give u flower?   And do you usually go for looks? or you will make him look better when he is you boyfriend?

20090220005857AA64BQM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I marry my friend in the Navy? Help!!?	Okay so my friend is in the Navy.... We have been really good friends since high school but I have known him since middle school.... And we are both 20 years old now....He has ALWAYS been there for me as I have for him. He is an amazing guy. Well, the other day he called me and told me that he was thinking about something... and that if I wanted to marry him. I was really surprised and I listened to what he had to say... He told me that in the Navy they make extra money for being married and that if I married him he would help me more. I do not have a job and the money would definitely help me and I know it would help him too. He said I could have time to think about it so... here I am thinking about it and I don't know what to do...   He told me that there would be no attachments and that we could see other people but to be honest I would feel weird doing that.... If I married him I think I would want to be with HIM... because I feel like eventually I could fall for him as more then a friend.... Maybe even as a husband....   I enjoy talking to him and spending time with him.... he makes me happy... all that stuff.    But I still don't know what to do....   I really need the money... I am getting unemployment and I have been looking for a job but can't find one anywhere and as of right now I can barely pay for bills or groceries. I live with my Grama and even her disability is not enough lately.... So like I said the money is much needed but then I think is it worth a marriage??   What if I end up falling in love with him?    What if I don't do it and then wish I did?    What if I do do it and get screwed over??   I am soooo confused....    I WANT to do it.... I am excited to do it even...    But I don't know if I SHOULD do it....   and I am not ONLY thinking about money either....    I wouldn't even think about it if it was any of my other friends....    It is partly because it is HIM....       What should I do??    Please give me answers with pros and cons   or logical reasons why this is right or wrong?   I need any answers I can get but please don't judge me.   Thank you.

20090220025741AARArlk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me????????????	I have this guy classmate of mine, who is at the same time is my seatmate. Some of my friends tell me that were very close and we sometimes have some moments that they call as "lambingan", i'm not quite sure about those times because for me he was just being "makulit" and most of all those moments are so often that i get used to it. So for me, there's nothing special about those.      But as we spend more time together, I can now feel that we are really close, and I can tell that he is so trustworthy that I even found myself very comfortable with his presence and company. With our situation by now, is it possible that he likes me?      He even cracked a joke with me today, that I was his partner for the prom.... I hope so, but I'm not sure if he mean it... I really wanted him to be my prom date... But I don't know if he will mention it again...... Our prom is three days to go but I don't have a date yet and I'm 10000000000% sure that he don't already have a date....... Would he ask me?

"I pay the bills around here." "I put bread on the table." That stuff. My parents are good people, neither are alcoholics or drug users. My dad has a job, my mom is a house wife constantly cleaning(Four family members total, 6 cats, a bird and a tank of fish.). I just want to put it to an end. I think its stupid and childish to fight meaninglessly like this. Can anyone help?

20090203123456AAi5qgR	Family & Relationships;Family	Why does my dad put me down?	okay so my dad is such a jerk all the time. he yells and screams about everything, critizes me about everything i do, and is so rude to me about everything. all he cares about is being the best football coach he can possibly be. he cant even try to be a good father. he always puts me down saying things like "im going to be driving you to dunkin donuts for the rest of your life" and "you have no future" and get ready for this one.. "shes going to be pregnant by the time shes 19" (saying that to my mom - i overheard him) okay im 17 now and i havent even had sex yet or have had a boyfriend in a long time. i dont know why he thinks im that type of person and says such mean and discouraging things to and about me.    about 3 years ago.. i had extreme selff-esteem issues and hated who i was as a person. i hated everything. i got in a lot of trouble because i was always trying to be "cool" and hang out with all the badasses. ive come a long way since then, and now, i have the highest self-esteem you will ever imagine. i love who i am no matter what happens. i love the qualities i have. im a good person with a good heart. im not trying to be conceited or anything, but its the truth and im proud to say that im not the same depressed person i was before.    he just doesnt understand that a person that is as mature and good as i am .. you just cant have it all. so what i get a couple C's, and i didnt do too hot on my midterms. but i have found ways to cope with the fact that i am not a good student and instead i am a good person. why cant he see that? it just really hurts to know that the vision my own father has of me is a 19 year old pregnant girl with no future. i dont drink, ive never done a drug, and im still a virgin. so why would he say something like that. he is supposed to be the one who is saying your a good person and anyone who doesnt see that can go screw.. instead of me saying dad im a good person why cant you see that?   please help me. what should i do? im afraid if i talk to him, hes just going to yell and critize me like he always does.      sorry it was so long, it was kind of a venting session.

20090203123901AAmYBLF	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you stop loving or wanting someone?...?	My ex-fiance broke up with me two days after Christmas.  I still love her, but she doesn't love me in that way anymore.      We are still close and we need to be because we have kids together.  She still lives with me, because I want to know she is safe.      I am in no "financial" position to seek out another person I could love, or would love me back.  Not to mention I get horny as hell, and every time I can't have her, I get stressed like hell.      Now there is another guy in the picture that she has said she has feelings for, which I don't believe is as true feelings as she thinks.  Not to mention I know this type of guy to be dangerous, they aren't dating or anything, but I can't stop her from falling for him.      I want to know she is safe, but everyday I see her I feel even more rejection and heartache.  But since I don't have cash to spare, I can't even take a girl out just to have fun, or anything and it is driving me nuts.  She is the only one I have for any compassion or sex, but being without her, without anyone else in my life, still feels worse than just taking what I can get from her.      Any suggestions!?
20090203123930AA5yxLa	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I deal with my friend moving?!?!?	Well okay so my friend told us today that he is moving in 45 days.

When I went away for a bit, he sent me lots of really lovely emails saying he missed me and stuff. And when I got back I introduced him to my friends and they got on well too. I gave him this stupid note saying 'you have to send me lots and lots of emails every day and come to visit me and introduce me to your family!'. It was a joke... but now when I email him he's offhand and doesn't really say much, but he emails my friends heaps. What's wrong? Didn't he realise the note was a joke? Should I tell him it was a joke or would that just seem even more desperate? Please help, I really want to stay friends with this guy. Thanks so much!

20090203124705AAMUT6q	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Older Boyfriend. Should I or Shouldn't I?	Ok, so I met this guy in a bar, he's the Dj/manager/barman, so sexy. He's tall and really handsome. I was with my friends and the place was quiet empty, he came to our table and asked my name, aparently he had seen me before about a month earlier, and I do remember a guy asking me how to get to some place, I didn't remember him, but he seemed to remember me pretty good. So the night I met him officially, he asked my name and we talked for a while outside the place, he asked my age and my number. so everything was good after that, we started dating and I got a big big crush on him and it seems like he's got a huge crush on me too. so everything was perfect until I found out his age - 29... pretty shocking, hu? I can imagine all people's faces when they know, a 17 year-old girl with a 29 year-old man.!! But he's actually a very respectful guy, he doesnt do drugs, he quit smoking and he drinks only socially (just like me). He has the mind of a teenager but he's mature like an adult. He's PERFECT!!   yesterday we were talking about what we should do, have a serious relationship, have fun for a while or just end it and remember it as something really fun and magical.    Another "Con" or maybe a "pro", I don't know. I'm gonna be an exchange student next year, I'm leaving to switzerland, Austria or Norway (I don't know yet) in August, so I'm not going to see him for one year. He's pretty worried about that.    So, from where I can see it, I'd like to have a relationship with him for this six months I got left, go on my exchange and come back with 18 years on my passport, and go on with our relationship, which would be easier because I'd be an adult. I want to tell him my plan and see what he thinks about it.   Do you think it might work?    What would you do if you were in my situation?
20090203124732AATLmSf	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I made a huge mistake..?	I broke up with my boyfriend on 26th december, we were together for 2 and a half years.      i cheated on him then broke up with him because i thought we'd never work, that it was over, and that i didnt deserve him - even though he forgave me for cheating...      i miss him.      and i still love him.      i keep thinking, if i hadnt jumped the gun, and of id though about things more and made an effort to rebuild our relationship, rather than break up, that we'd have been amazing together. I feel like i broke up too soon.Like we still had so much left...      i want him back :( i dont know what to to, or to say. People say to ignore him, and he'll come to you but, i know if itd been me who cheated and broke up, i wouldnt have the confidence to speak to him.      I've sent him a letter, telling him how i feel, and that i miss what we had, and that id really love it if we'd make another go of it, and that we'd talk about everthing.      But he didnt reply, he just hugged me really hard the next time he saw me (at my friends house) before talking to his mate (my friends boyfriend). He smiled at me really sweetly, there was somethign behind his eyes....      what do i do?      xxx

20090219233809AA7bXIc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there's this guy and it's so COMPLICATED!?	Basically, I kinda like this guy... but the problem is that he's one of my good friend's ex-bf. She's repeatedly told me last year and this year that she never really quite had feelings for him and he was slightly obnoxious... but he was also always nice. I don't want show any feelings like I kinda slightly like him because his myspace says that he's in a relationship. The other problem is that I never see him with a girlfriend. Not on his myspace, not in real life. His ex told me that he had a gf... but I never see her. Ever. There's not even pictures of them together on his myspace. So here's the confusing part. I don't know him that well but he seems flirtatious. I don't want to flirt back though because that'd be just TABOO for GUY IN RELATIONSHIP. But he also invited me to see this thing in his competition and it's like GUHWHUTAMISUPPOSETODO. I'm afraid to ask his ex too so I'm just left here... confused and stupid. Boy, I hope neither of them uses Yahoo Questions on a regular basis. v__v       Heeeeelppp mee. I'm embarrassed.

20090220011055AA7Zwha	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to deal with Girlfriends ex?	We've been dating for about 3 months now and things are going great, but she has a ex boyfriend whom she dated for 6 years (Highschool, then to the same college, lived together).  He lives in the same town so when we go out, I've encountered him about 3 times already.        I only introduced my self once to her ex boyfriend but that was it.  She ofcourse tells me that they are over and that she is finished with him, yet they share a dog (sort of like a child in custody) so she switches the dog back and forth about twice a week with him.  I know she likes me (we havn't really dropped the L bomb yet) and I like her alot but I feel pretty threatned about this ex boyfriend charcter.  That they dated for 6 years and lived together as well.  They have been broken up for 8 months now.  I have trust issues with girls, and I have been fucked over before so I feel secure when I **** over other girls as well.  So the only way to comfort my self is to think that if she does end up getting back together with this Ex figure, then i can just go **** other girls..  Am I just being insecure about her Ex?  I'm an full grown succesful adult and I can't believe this jr.high issue is getting to me..      Thank you for your time.
20090220011604AAHe7lh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GF cheated with 12 men; will she be loyal to me if she has my baby?	My new GF told me that she cheated on her now ex-BF with 12 different men while she was with him b/c he did not give her the attention she wanted from him (he would only see her a few times a month, and that too only as a "booty call").      While she was with him, she was regularly having sex with (1) her "friend with benefits" twice a month, (2) a man she called her "f*ckbuddy" once a month, and (3) having random one-night stands.      She also slept with her sister's husband.      She now claims that she will be loyal to me and will not lie to me, but I've already caught her lying to me on 3 different occasions: (1) denying that she slept with her brother-in-law, (2) denying that she got drunk and slept with my best friend -granted it was BEFORE she and I hooked up, (3) denying that she had cut off contacts with her "friend with benefits" and her "f*ckbuddy".      I keep giving her the benefit of the doubt, but it's very frustrating. She wants me to get her pregnant and says that it's "only cheating if you're married" b/c then you're "committed infront of God and family."      Should I get her pregnant and hope she will not cheat on me?

My fiance (whom I love with all of my heart) told me that she thought that we "may" last. She's not for sure if our differences (we are almost opposite) will make us break apart. I am truly in love with her and want to be with her for the rest of my life, but shes not for sure if were going to work out. I want to stay with her, but if she doesn't know if were going to last, do you think that she truly really loves me? Oh and we were talking one time and she said that I am "good enough for her". It kinda hurt me, but she said she didn't mean it.

20090220042406AAXXDfb	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I Throw My Family Out?	Recently a family member came to me saying that she was unable to find accomodation due to a blacklisting of her name on a residential database. She then asked if I would rent a house in my name so that my nieces and nephews would not be out on the street.  Not wanting them to pay for their parents problems, I agreed.  We have been in this new house for a while now and for the past few weeks my sister and her partners relationship has been getting really bad with alot of fighting and slamming doors.  It came to a head just recently when my sisters partner went to hit her, I stepped in and threw him out of my house.  My sister was fine with this, and he spend a couple of days in the park, I told her that I would let her decide when or if he was going to come back but to seriously think about the impact on their kids.  Two days passed and he was back, its now 3 days later and were back to the same thing, I am in the middle of a degree and dont want this sh*t in my life.  My sister said she will handle it but its just talk.  Should I throw them out, or is there another answer.  The last thing I want is the police involved after he has potentially hit my sister.  Your advise would be greatly appreciated!

20090220063423AApbAvZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are virgin men a turnoff?	This is especially for women that have had sex. Would you want to date a guy that is planning to stay a virgin until he's in a very serious relationship, or possibly even marriage? I'm a good looking guy, 6'7" 245 lbs muscular/toned build, black hair blue eyes. I'm extremely smart and nice too. It just seems like all the girls I meet are just looking for one night stands or short flings, when I'm not like that at all. I've had drunk girls try to come back to my place more than once but I don't want to have sex until I'm in love with the girl. I want to find a girl that's looking for something serious, but it's hard to find. So if your a girl that's had sex before would a guy like me be a turnoff?

We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I dont feel like he's using me for anything, I just feel like he does certain things because he feels he owes me...which is just as bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"   The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for)...circumstances make me wonder though.

20090220052129AAj8PmU	Family & Relationships;Family	More advice please...I need more advice from people... I am very stressed out?	Let me give you some background on myself. I am 17 and a senior in high school. I have roughly a 3.5 gpa and have been accepted to every college I have applied to and so far have recieve an offer of 10k scholarship to one and 14k to another-with others to come soon. Okay so I get migraines 2-3x's/wk and get dizziness which causes my eyes to go black for 2-secs to a few mins. It makes it difficult to go to school so I have missed about 38 days so far this year. We are trying to get home bound (teacher comes to the house, my sister got it for a whole year for getting pregnant) but they are giving a tough time about it. We should know by today, the doctor probably will sign it. I am about to break though. My mother and step-father were talking about kicking me out of the house because this is causing them so much stress. They said they can't deal with me. I am not much more welcome at my dad's house as he gives my sister everything she wants and I end up with the short end of the stick--it would be even moreso now that the baby is there and is 10 months old. My sister came home drunk, did drugs, got pregnant, and NO ONE ever threatened to kick her out. Why is it that I get sick by something that I can't control and they want to kick me out? I can't work at your traditional stand up place. I've tried it. I almost passed out several times. What should I do? I am very upset by this. I think it may have just been better I was never born because neither of my parents have ever seemed to want me and when things get bad they always threaten calling the cops or sending me away or something. I am a good student and a good kid. What did I do wrong?

20090220060640AAZ3UoZ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Does your spouse totally gross you out to the point where you can't have intimacy?	I don't want to sleep with my spouse, but this person has told me they will leave me if I don't, and we have a child together, I want to stay married for my child, among other reasons. If I were to divorce I would be living on the dole, I don't even have my own car and the money we make is just enough to barely get by, I can't "Save up." We get along fine, but this one issue is starting to take over my life because the spouse will not let it go. We're young. I can't blame my spouse I guess. I don't like to be pressured but what choice do I really have? This is horrible!      If anyone is wondering, I am grossed out/turned off because my spouse has become fat, eating and drinking too much, never exercises, and is so depressing all the time, everything is horrible and the world is against them. My spouse is a victim. Always a victim. I care for this person but I no longer desire intimacy! Maybe it's wrong of me but you know what... there is nothing I can do. I almost feel like, really dirty and horrible when I agree to sex.      I know this person would leave me if I said hey I think your lack of motivation and your personal appearance is sickening and I don' twant to sleep with you. But I don't want to be divorced and have my child carted to and fro, ugh.

20090219232703AAzgKqQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	It's so intimidating? o_O.?	He just thinks his so good. He's the vice captain of the school. To be honest I think all the girls would've voted for him because he's such a 'lady's man'.       The point is, he just looks at me like as if he owns the world or something. It gets to me. We don't exactly talk at all. I don't think either of us have the guts to even say hi to each other. lol. He probably thinks I'm the quiet type because I'm usually the one that focuses in class. It's the HSC year. Don't usually want to muck around.       How do you put someone back in their place..? What could I do without making a big scene..?      This story is peculiar. But it annoys me when people think they are 'all that' when I'm not even in a position of power. It's like they tread on you, but you can't do anything about it. Or is there a way? :)      I guess I could be more involved in the school and have some recognition.       Me, even saying this feels like I'm wasting my time because I don't want to be bothered by some guy that thinks his so awesome. His in two of my classes, unfortunately. Really, I don't want anything to do with him. LOL. And you could say I partially have a crush on him. I want it removed immediately.         Be nice. :)

I've got a separate account on Yahoo!Answers that my friend discovered recently and she always looks through my answers and questions. i mean, I don't have anything bad on it, its just private and not something i want people i know looking at. the whole point of this site is that its anonymous. she was looking through some questions i'd answered today and she was saying how stupid some of the questions were and my answers were really silly. I don't like that, people come on this site for help, not to be judged and I don't like her saying judgmental things like that, about both me and the asker. its my account and not something i want her seeing. its private to me. i tried saying not too, but she can easily have a good look through when im not there. i would just make a new account but i've got 20,000 points+ and im a TC so i don't want it gone just because of my friend.

He didnt want to be tied down in a relationship so he broke up with me. He insisted that we remain friends because he didnt want to lose me and we hung out a few times since the break up. He would make plans for us to have dinner but then never called and went to go party. I finally had enough and whenever he called or texted after that, I didnt reply. A month later, I saw him and he asked why I was ignoring him and I said I have been really busy. This was the last time I talked to him over a month ago. I think I am pretty much over him (I have been kissing this other guy haha) but I have really missed talking to him, as a friend and now I feel that ignoring him was a mistake and that he is still immature but maybe I should be patient with him. He was my first so I dont want him to simply disappear out of my life. I know his schedule and I want to "accidently" bump into him and see if he will talk to me and if he still wants to be friends. Is this a good idea?

I have recently installed a smoke detector (hidden camera), gave her multiple teddy bears (hidden cameras inside), "left" my pen (hidden camera pen) at her house, and have a few remote cameras outside to see when she leaves for work.  Is that illegal?  And what can I do so that she doesn't find out?  This was for personal reasons.  Thanks!
20090219232544AArajTt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	8 months into a relationship - and its not working, can I do the fade?	Is it appropriate to just fade away from a relationship if we've been in it for 8 months? We were very close, talking for hours at a time and seeing each other twice every other week.      But I feel like things need to end now, and I dont know how to say it...is it ok to just avoid the phone calls and do the fade?

Like no one other courts you and pays special attention to you like this person, and then you fall for him. But then when you think of it, had there been any other guys who court you, you wouldnt pick him..but since he is the only one courting you as of the moment, and you feel something for him, is it considered love or could lead to love?

20090220043109AAu6oUu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Gift for Girlfriend: Opinions on what she's thinking?	I'm with my Girlfriend for about a year now (she's turning 35 in May & I'II be 23 in 17 days) & I love & adore her with all of my heart & soul just as much as she loves me, if not more. It's amazing when people smile & (surprisingly) even compliment us when they see us in public together. My Girlfriend & parents haven't met as yet, but my Mom & Dad have always been supportive of me & they can't wait to see her (so please don't give me those immature, yet offensive "cougar" comments).      Anyway, I'm getting a little extra cash this month & since I work with computers everyday (& I've recently been working a LOT on Notebooks/Laptops), she's been obsessed to get her hands on one. We're Co-Workers too, so she comes into my office 2 days ago & she was like almost crying when she saw me working on one & said "PLEASE buy me a laptop?" (kind of cute the way she said it too). So, I wanted to surprise her by BUYING a notebook (laptop) of her very own.      Unfortunately, she got it out of me yesterday & she was so ecstatic about it that she could hardly get her hands off me. She says that nobody's ever done something like this for her before (which obviously meant that she really appreciated it). The thing is, I don't expect her to do anything in return for me, so how do I reassure her that she doesn't have to go out of her way just to find something for me? After all, She's given me everything I could possibly ask for & that's more than enough for me.

She said she had to do some homework but when she got here we ended up watching a movie.  She has come over before.  We usually pick a movie turn off the lights and lay on my bed.  She always gets a blanket for herself as if she doesnt want any funny business but it just feels like I should wrap my arms around her.  I don't want to have her over just because i feel worse when she leaves and I didnt do anything, another missed opportunity.  I'm not even thinking about sex just simply have my arm around her and hold her.  Do girls usually watch movies with their guy friends like this or should I try to get a little closer?   I just can't stop thinking about her.

Quick summary, Just before myself and my ex's 1 yr she broke up with me......shortly afer ended up messing with this guy. From wishful thinking and seeing pictures online and our 1 year anniversy and it being christmas timethe whole nine i was emotionally torn apart. this was all back in december   She still to this day is with this guy, now she dates him " officially". Me and her rarely talk, if ever. She has her new man,I'm livin it up being single we both are doing out own thing.      Today she instant messages me about do i miss her?....(which anyone can think that I must have been or currently am on her mind) i tell her "basically not anymore had it been 2 months ago yes" etc. Then she talks about us not talkin and not even being friends etc. I tell her that i feel like my efforts to be a friend are drawn out of me from everything back when we first broke it off. later in the conversation it gets to me saying i'm still cool with you and we have no problems. She then replies she feels like its her and she doesnt think she can handle being "just friends" b/c if she knew or saw me with others girls she'd still feel some type of way.      honestly I'm more so asking what does this mean? and should i still go amongst my life with her in the rear view, or attempt to at least be cool with her, also a good amount of me still has strong feelings       I'm a 20 y.o. in college, I've had a whole lot of crazy college fun but she was the only girl who made me feel, and act completely different words dont describe it............yet am i just reminiscing       but for the record i have moved on with my life , i still have feelings for her but I dunno what would come of me and her in the future....

20090220065154AAGgh2m	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is there anyone else out there that has never been in love with their spouse?	Ok don't shoot. I love my spouse very much he has given me two Beautiful children and has supported me and I have supported him as well over the years. However I am not in love with my spouse. We have been having problems for a while now and I know the reason our marriage wont' work is because I'm not in love with him I never was. I know I should have known to not get married if I felt this way, but I was dumb and immature. We started a family before marriage and things just took place. I felt as if I was being led down a road that I knew was wrong but wasn't strong enough to speak up.      Yes, I'm guilty, but it means I love him really to a point. But when I look into his eyes, I don't get watery eyed or feel up with emotion. He is the father of my children, he is good to me and my family loves him as do I. But in love means passion, just really heart felt love. Think of him and smile. I don't get that. . To be honest, someone in the past has that torch. My solution is divorce but I would hate having my children not having their parents under one roof but I want to be happy. Whats the right thing to do or your thoughts would be helpful. Should I tell my husband how I truly feel? I don't want to break his heart because I know he is crazy about me and that said is another reason I have stayed.

20090220071936AAPIGgS	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I dump him....he may not be in love?	Been seeing a guy very often for 3 months and he hasn't told me he loves me.  I've blurted out that I love him several times, which he seems to enjoy, but now I'm feeling pretty stupid about it because it feels one sided.  He treats me well; we enjoy our sex; i have the key to his house, but that doesn't mean he loves me or ever will.  He's told me that he takes awhile for him to love someone and he's concerned that I view him as a rebound relationship (which I think is a lame  excuse) because it's been over a year since my last relationship.  I discussed how foolish I feel about telling him I love him without getting any response.  I've tried to NOT tell him I love him, but then I feel phony and restrained.  He's told me to just go with the flow and reminded me that he's not searching for anyone else and has given me free rein to his home, which in my opinion could also mean that he's real happy with sex!.  I'm feeling like he's just "in sex" not in love.  I'm thinking that after 3 months, he probably should have verbally said I love you.  Should I cut my losses now?  I feel like a fool and don't want to put in too much more time into the relationship if I'm not going to be loved in returned?  What would you do?

20090220055429AAb3R8p	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	When changing a child's last name...?	I am currently in the process of changing my son`s last name.   Before anyone says "don`t do it, it will confuse the kid", the kid isn`t even two yet, so he won`t be confused.   I`ve also heard the argument "a child should have his father`s last name", but the truth is, I have full support of my ex-husband, and his consent, for the name change.    The name isn`t being changed because I`m not with my ex-husband anymore, or to "get back at him". We are doing it for completely other reasons.   The name will become a hyphenated version of my ex`s last name and mine.       With that said... After the name change is in effect, where do I have to change it? SSN? Hospital records?  I can't think of everywhere it would need to be changed, can anyone help?
20090220063706AAfb7RO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell him before, or after?...?	I'm a single divorced mother of a 20 month old boy.   I have sole legal and physical custody, my ex has a little bit of visitation.      I'm having our son baptized next month, and I'm not sure if I should tell my ex-husband before or after it is done. He has been against it (the baptism) from the start, stating when I was pregnant that I was NOT to have the child baptized. I'm worried that if I tell him before, he'd make trouble. But I'm sure that if I tell him after, he'd blow a fuse too..      I have sole custody, which means I can have the child baptized without his consent, that I can make decisions for my son regarding religion, or education, without him.       What would you do? Tell him before and run the risk of him cause trouble or showing up to cause a scene? Tell him after and run the risk of him blowing a fuse and threatening legal actions (yeah, he believes if things don't go his way, he can bring me back to court all the time)? Just have it done and not tell him at all?

20090220060019AAGKuP6	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Baby at the wedding--part 3!?	*SIGH* I am so sick of this drama.  Back story is this:   We are having an adult wedding  with no babies.  My fiance's sister will have a 1 years old by then and after some pissing and moaning from her, she agreed that she will arrange to have him at the photos and we will compensate the person who brings him.  After that was worked out, his dad got involved and yelled at him on the phone.  That was months ago and it has not been brought up since.      Last weekend he and my fiance were going somewhere and he asked his son if he had changed his mind about the baby.  Of course we haven't and he got all pissed again.  He then told him that if the baby wont be there then his sister's husband has said then he wont come either.  (PS his sister is a bridesmaid and my fiance was in her wedding party were he helped A LOT with the wedding set up and take down).      We are gong there for brunch on Sunday and I want this put to bed once and for all.  I don't think we should debate it anymore, because the decision has been made.      How should we go about bringing this up and making sure its put to rest?  He and I are paying for the wedding with some financial help from both parents (but not enough to foot the whole bill of course)  I have also, set up a website that will be sent out shortly and its states that it is adult only as will the invitations.      **NOTE** Please don't waste your time telling me how you've been weddings were kids acted fine, or that he should be there because he is family or any other tripe---NO BABIES WILL BE THERE!        Thanks

Once he even asked "you're ok with him right?"      What should I do?   please don't tell me to reconcile with that guy...it's not possible.         PS:   he asks me this stuff when the other guy i hate is around...in front of him.   what should i do/say in front of him?
20090220055635AAxy9bj	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did he have a soft erection?	A guy I use to date about 6 months ago---and I had broke off. But for the last two months, we casually kept in contact via email. When we had sex 6 months ago---it was some of the BEST sex I ever had. And he use to always tell me, how great it was for him too. Well we SELDOMLY if ever used condoms and luckily I never got pregnant. Well, the other night---we hooked up. It had been 6 months since our last time, and he WORE a condom. He was SOFT the entire time and couldn't keep an erection. I finally, told him---not to worry and we just went to sleep. Could he NOT get hard because of the condom, and him being use to going raw with me---or was he too nervous from time spent apart...I am confused and am wondering where we'll go from here...because I NEVER want to initiate sex again unless he feels "up" to it (pun intended)

20090220062257AAfrYDf	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Has anyone ever gotten married in Central Park in New York ?	I am considering getting married in Central Park but would like more information. The wedding co-ordinator for Central Park has given me some basic information regarding where I can have it and permit costs but they are currently updating their packages so have nothing to show me at the moment.      I was just wondering if anyone has got married there and if you could tell me anything about where you had the reception or how many guests you had and the arrangement for them etc ( as you cant have chairs in central park)      Any information would be great, thanks in advance :-)
20090220064206AALTS5p	Family & Relationships;Family	All my dad does is take things away. HELP ME!?	Note: FAMILY CONCELING DOES NOT WORK. HE WILL NEVER LISTEN TO THEIR ADVICE.      I ended up in the happy hotel and he didn't listen to their advice eather. Every time I try to get a word in he always has to butt in with... OH NICK... DONT USE (MYYYYYYYYYY) COMPUTER..... I'm like uh I don't care... (because I can just sneak on. The only reason I sneak on is because I'm done gaining his trust. He still doesn't trust me for one little thing I did two years ago. and now why even try to anymore? I FREAKING HATE HIM SO MUCH..... He never shuts up and lectures me for hours and hours.... He will not listen to any theripest/conceler or whatever. But if  I try to talk to him he just yells at me and says that I have an attitude problem. How can I get him out of my life without going to foster care/ killing him/ killing myself?
20090220080446AAYHO9Z	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Friend in unhealthy relationship - supposed to be her maid-of-honor, too - how to deal?	This may turn out slightly long, so if it does, I apologize.      My best friend got engaged after 6 months to this guy.  He had a problem with my boyfriend being a friend of hers (he has a problem with ANY man in her life before her) and he never wanted to get together with us so I haven't seen her for a while, though she's now making more of an effort, but never WITH him.  Only the two of us.      She recently told me something that made my heart drop to my stomach.  She said that his father had bought him a hunting rifle for Christmas.  She informed him that the gun was not allowed in their place, ever.  When I asked why, she said, "Because his dad used to beat his mom senseless and he has enough anger issues as it is..." and continues on with her story.  Inside my head, I contemplated how I wanted to respond, which was, "I'm sorry.  Are you telling me that you don't want a gun in your house because you fear that he might someday THREATEN you with it???"  And these are the kinds of things she tells me all the time.  Other problems:      - EVERY action he takes is the fault of his mom, his dad or his ex.  He takes no responsibility for his problems.  She encourages this.   - When she is in class, he will text her.  He knows that she won't answer texts in class, and yet when she gets out, she has 5 or 6 just pummeling her with bull about how she never answers and what is she doing and who is she with???  He knows her schedule, they live together.   - He has accused her, ragingly, several times, of cheating on him.  Even though there is no way that is possible, as he is either with her or she is in class.   - When we hang out, she often refers to the time period before him...not directly, but she'll say, "I miss my life from a year and a half ago..." which makes me wonder how happy she really is.   - Let me repeat...she won't allow a GUN in the house because she worries about his ANGER.   - She has asked me to be her maid-of honor, which is something I don't want to deny my best friend.  But I don't even know the guy, though they've been together over a year and all I ever hear are these emotional abuse stories that she doesn't even recognize.      I am at a total loss on what to do here.  I've said things before and she's gotten angry and I've almost lost her.  Now, I occasionally slip in little nuggets that I hope to God she thinks about later when she's alone.  They are not getting married until September of next year so I hope it's all straightened out before then, but I don't know what to do.  I want to give her things to think about without alienating myself from her entirely.  Because if I do that, then she has NO ONE to turn to - I am literally the only friend she sees anymore.  And I don't want her to only have this guy as an outlet.      So, I guess my questions are: have you ever had a friend in a relationship that scared you for her?  Have you been asked to be a maid-of-honor and give a speech about true love and stand up for a couple that you don't believe is right?  What do you do about it?  And, is there ANYTHING else I can be doing for her?  Should I be more direct?      I'm worried for her.      Gah - sorry.  This is a novel.  If you made it this far, advice is MUCH appreciated.

What do I say to this guy that I've known for years that happens to be my uncles friend?   OK so weve known eachother for 3-4 years. My uncle is only 1 year older than me, incase your thinking I'm sick lol. Anyways, I really like this guy. And like a year or two ago we both admitted we had crushes on eachother. But thing is, we live like about an hour away and only see eachother like once a year? But I've always had a crush on him. We talk on myspace all the time. My uncle moved last Dec. to New York, so he's gone. So the other day on myspace I told him that I basically broke up with my bf and wanted to know whats going on with his love life. Surprisingly he said there was no lady? So then I replied that "Now you have my attention". I am interested, I really am, but I don't want him to think I'm throwing myself at him, also I meant I'm interested in why he doesnt have one because hes so cute and charming. But he replied, "what type of atttention jess? lol i havent been really interested.. but now my hormones are starting to kill me.. you know what i mean.."      Thing is I know how to answer these questions when they arent concerning me, other thing is can I have a translation of what he means? Whats going on in his brain lol. Also what do you suggest I write back thats cute and has him wanting more but not boring-AND NOT SLUTTY, I'm serious, if your gona write a rude answer just move on to another answer plz. Thanks. =)

Women complain that the father of their child is nowhere in site, deadbeat dads and then they complain when the father is there. You just cant win. How can any woman in the world begrudge good fathers wanting to see their children. I know everyone isnt perfect, but my husband is a very good man who loves his children more than anything in the world, yet his ex is the most evil b**** ive ever met in my life and does everything to make life hard. I have never done anything wrong to her and i never put her down in front of her children as they should respect her no matter how crazy she is. Her daughter has got a nervous twitch now because of her playing stupid games and im getting fed up with it now. Im even thinking about doing a degree in family law to help fathers out, they have every right to be in their childs life. My dad died when i was 13 and would do anything to have him in my life.

I have a reasonably attractive and have a good figure, but I am very shy and don’t wear anything that will attract attention to myself, but do dress nicely in a modern way.      The problem is recently while putting away some ironing of my husband to be that I discovered 3 string bikinis and 2 sexy swimsuits that he has obviously bought for me for our honeymoon.   He doesn’t know that I found these and have tried them on twice, but each time when I have tried these bikinis and swimsuits on all I feel is naked and vulnerable and this is at home in private, so I don’t think I will be able or want to wear them in public.      How am I going to explain this to my husband to be, when he gives me these bikinis and swimsuits probably on honeymoon?

Decided to text this girl I just met who I thought might be interested in me (well I did her number). I think she responded pretty positively, some laughing (like after I addressed her as babe), and pretty quick responses. She never asked who I was so she obviously remembered. But I don't know if it's because she's interested or because she's just being friendly, so wanted to see what other women think (it's easier for me to make a move when I know the girl's interested). Thanks.

20090220071518AAp9uZz	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Would you stay in a relationship like this?	He always has his ways so he ended up touching my private parts but I tried to avoid him and I told him to stop. Then all he would say was "but we've been through so much to get back together" and that he wouldn’t touch a girl like that if he didn’t love her. At that moment, getting touched like that seemed enjoyable but when I go back home and have some alone time, the guilt starts building up and I can't get over the fact that I got touched like that even if we had our clothes on. So I started acting indifferent to what he says whenever we chat on msn or even on our next meeting.
20090220055334AAanUTq	Family & Relationships;Friends	I feel like All my life ive tried too hard with people?	Im a 17 year old guy, I have good friendships and a good family life, am in school, etc, so in terms of the bigger picture, everythings going ok and is in my control. However, my problem (if you look at it that way) is that I care too much, I give too much of a damn about what ppl think, and all my life i feel like all Ive done is tried too hard with ppl and ended up pushing them away. My friend whos a couple years older feels the same and said you have to 'play the game' and conceal your emotions and be cool in order to get what you want, and that it seems like nothing is ever enough for ppl, and no matter what you do, ppl arent satisfied, which ive found is true, especially when it comes to girls.   Will I ever find a girl who I dont have to 'play the game' with, or one who sees through that?   also, does anyone else feel the same?
20090220064704AAfpWxb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How likely is it that I get child custody as a mother?	I am so sad, so sad, so sad, I married my husband based on love, but all he has done in the past 3 years is hurting me day and night. He makes me feel ugly, he never ever listens to me, when I sing every single time, he asks me to turn the volume down, when I dance, every time, he tries to stop me, when I talk he rarely pays attention, to the point that I am always quiet at home, because I know it's better not to say anything than being hurt. OMG, he has nothing to offer me, he doesn't show love, or nothing. I am so depressed. I can't believe that it's so hard for me to make a decision and leave him. Nothing is working, ever, no amount of talking, begging for attention, thinking about different ways,,, nothing works. I have wasted 3 years of my life in total misery day and night. I can't get out,,,, why is it so hard? Why does it look impossible? I am a student, getting $800 pcm paying the rent and bills with that, he works gets $2000 and pays $800 for nursery of our kid and spends the rest of it on his TV, car and mobile habits. If I leave, I can't afford the nursery money, he is a US citizen and I am a conditional green card holder,,,, I am scared about everything. What should I do?

20090220073136AAUIxeM	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i get over him?	I have just recently broken up with my long term partner of 2 years. I am only 16 and this is my first break up. He did it on Tuesday night saying that he didn't think we would work out and that it was better to just end it now. I also found out that he like my best mate, who is also his best friend. The best mate has decided that she's gonna stop coming to our houses (we live across the road from each other) to stop herself having to chose. She's sworn to me that there are no feelings for him on her part and i trust her, she has also said that she wouldn't do that to me, especially so soon.       I am finding it really tough getting over him, we were always together and shared everything, i really want to be able to just move on like he has and find someone else and just enjoy my time again. With it being half term i do think it's worse & maybe when i go back to school it'll be better. We are still mates and i care about him but all he wants is our best mate and i am trying to make him see that she doesnt want him and he cant keep hanging onto her just like i cant keep hanging onto him.      I want to be able to sleep at night and eat, open my blinds and spend time with my family but i have to talk to him and i find it harder at night when he signs off msn or something because i cant talk anymore, we were so dependant on each other and the most annoying thing is that he's fine, he is living a normal life and doesnt even seem upset.       I want to be over him i just dont know how, its easy saying just take it a day at a time and eventually everything will be ok but how long will it take and how do i get by each day knowing i have no one there to be comforted by or loved by.      Please help me overcome this, it's the hardest thing i've ever gone through in my life and i need to come out the other end of this strong and ready to move on.      Thanks
20090219234246AAt7nye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Attracted to older men?	I am 16 years old and in grade 11.    I have always been attracted to older men, although im not sure why.    Now more than ever though, I don't go for older boys or teens, or even guys my age, I just want older men, like 20,s 30,s that type of thing.       I find myself extremely attracted to my science teacher even though he's married with kids, and any older man I just can't contain myself, I want them all!    haha, whats going on with me? I have all these fantasies of being the school girl with the teacher, and just any older man I meet that I find attractive I silently lust for them. Although I never show any signs, or even mention it. I keep very reserved..       any thoughts? suggestions? statements? thanks!
20090220062331AASoZzR	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friend cancelled our meeting to see another friend, am i wrong to be mad?	And the friend is always there to meet, its not like hes in the country for 2 days or anything. we meet just as much.      I cancelled one meeting with my friend because of a last minute medical appointment.       Now he said he would be with me today, but then he went to another friend and said he didnt promise anything (when he did, he cant remember)      I just feel stupid and disappointed. (i know its a one time thing for sure, but he never appreciates my efforts for our friendship)
20090220075243AAg9aHB	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I stop being her friend?	My college roommate and I have remained friends after college. We have a lot in common- music, art etc- which is why we stayed friends. However, immediately after we make plans I regret that we did. I dread going out with her and can't wait to leave. We only get together once a month so I feel like its not a big deal, but I don't think I should feel this way around a friend. She is a really nice girl so I don't know what to do. Should I stop being her friend? How do I do that without hurting her feelings?

20090219232353AAL8nEr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible for a 2 people to be meant for each other?	Those of you that have read my previous Q already know the situation.      Anyways, I've been having that "love sick" feeling every time I'm away from my girlfriend. When I drop her off at her house at night, I feel like my insides were just ripped out. We're both 17 almost 18, still in school, and have been going out since the 13th of this month.      So I can't even sleep or anything without thinking about her. So I whipped up enough guts to tell her how I have been feeling, and surprisingly, she told me that she felt the exact same way! I couldn't believe my own ears when she told me that she had the same feelings for me like I do her. So we both talked about it and we both assured each other that we would ALWAYS be together and we agreed that NOTHING IN OUR POWER COULD EVER BRING US APART!      Since we've talked about, I feel a little better and she now calls me late. So yeah, I feel better.      And I also think that this is the one I'm gonna marry! I know it's only a 1 week relationship, but we've been friends for about 3+ years, and I feel like we've been with each other for 20+ years!      So, is it possible for a guy and a girl to be meant for each other? What are your thoughts?
20090219231247AA0h5UQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend goes to frat parties that I can't get into?	My girlfriend goes to frat parties, and I can't go with her because only frat guys are allowed in. Am I being selfish for not wanting her to go because I cannot enjoy it with her? Also is it weird for me to tell her to "not go too crazy" or some variation of that?      I just feel left out when she goes to all these parties without me. And it happens often. At least once a week. Help?

20090220072151AAgu1lh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do think I'm being unreasonable?  husbands and wives out there . . .?	I like to keep the thermostat at 70F during the winter while I'm at home.  I also wear layers of clothing since I tend to get easily cold as well.      Here's the scoop, last night I turned the thermostat from 67F to 70F as I was walking to the bedroom to put on some more clothes after returning from work.  My husband, told me "No!" that I had to go put on the clothes FIRST and then see how I felt, and THEN turn up the heat.  I told him his behavior was controlling and that I was going to put on clothes but the thermostat was on the way to the bedroom.  He knows that I have a tendency to be colder than him and get cold easily.  I have also been keeping the thermostat at 70F while we're at home, so that this isn't a change in my behavior.  He told me that I don't respect him and that I'm not willing to compromise acting like I'm living in my house like I'm single.  Then he started to make threats that when summer came around, he would crank the thermostat down low and leave his clothes on (instead of getting cooler by dressing in shorts).      I got a mild headache and some slight chest pain last night which I didn't disclose to him.  I kept the thermostat at 70F and explained to him that is generally the temp that I feel comfortable.  He said that "70" is just a number and that it's "all in your mind."      Overall, don't get me wrong, he's a great guy, but I'm kinda hurt and don't know how to handle this situation better.  It's such a silly thing to fight about the thermostat. . . . I know.      Please any suggestions are welcome!  : )

20090219235903AAlf4Xf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What if a girl wrote you this?	I dated a girl for a few months and then sort of d icked her around and stopped talking for 2 weeks.  Then I bluntly told her I wasn't interested in her romantically and was going through some problems.  I did apologize and she said she wanted to be friends.  Now I have been trying to start small talk by emailing her and this is what she wrote:      I'm sorry to say this, but I don't really feel like I should be talking to you for a while. This situation has hurt me more than I thought, and sadly, I am not a robot. I didn't deserve any of this - especially after I've mustered up even more energy to find sympathy for you and handle it well.      You've apologized very kindly and I know you're having some problems, so I am only trying to be honest. You will always be my friend :) Right now I'm just having some trouble extending myself to people who have truly hurt me.      What does this mean?  Was I really a d ick for cutting her off without explanation?
20090219231258AAEsrxy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it okay to explain to this guy that he hurt me and that I don't want to talk to him anymore?	This guy and I dated for 3 months.  he really d icked me around, didn't call for 2 weeks, and then decided he didn't like me anymore.  I was so crushed because I gave a lot of myself to him, but I handled it well (he apologized and said he was going through things) and said I was always there for him and wanted to be friends.      I don't want him back (of COURSE not!) but I am suddenly feeling really hurt by the situation.  I don't think it's fair that he walked out of it the way he wanted but I am feeling so low (I'll get over it soon, definitely).  He keeps messaging me on facebook - I am not a robot and can't always be expected to just bounce back in whatever format people want me to.  He's a pretty guilt-ridden person, and I don't want to hurt him, but I feel I deserve the right ending.      Is it okay to message him back and say that he really hurt me and that I don't want to speak to him for a while?

20090219232748AAJxyIj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls/women, so curious about this!?	I'm a single guy in college am always eying girls.  I literally actively scan the area. Sometimes I feel obnoxious doing it, and I think this probably gets annoying for most girls.       My question is: say...at the mall, between classes or a similar place, how often do you check out a guy you find cute?       Will you look until he catches you or only look if you don't think youll get caught?      It seems like girls are usually not paying attention and as a reaction will avoid eye contact...but maybe it just says something about me.       Thanks

However, I have a lot of exams coming up next week and told him i wont be able to hang out with him after school for two weeks but maybe on the weekend at least. He said thats fine school should always be first. He later found out he has to go out of town for work next week for about a week. So the only time we're both going to be able to see each other this week is at my friends birthday party this saturday. This whole week he keeps saying that he misses me and really wants to see me.However he said he is only stopping by for an hour and he is leaving for another party. I told him to just stay the whole time so we can see each other more. He said its not like we're going to have alone time. Its a party with a lot of people so its not like it matters. I was a little upset but didnt say anything. But should i be upset? or is his reason reasonable??

At first he wanted to wait to get to know me better and I thought that was great but now he says he loves me and has somehow put me on a pedestal as the best woman who has ever come into his life and therefore can't have sex with me because it would degrade me. We kiss and he's very romantic and I have fallen in love with him but would like to move our relationship to physical one. He started seeing a sex therapist last week and I'm just wondering if this can be treated or am I putting hope into something that will never progress.

I think there is so much to learn about you.x' I replied with 'not sure what this means"and then he never replied. I think he must have been checking out my pics on my space.

Now I'm an 18 year old male with a fairly active sex life and have  experienced maybe ten or so Handjobs from various girls and to be honest they have all been pretty boring, mainly due to the fact they were very effortless.      Is this because girls do not enjoy it, or quite simply think they are doing a good job but really aren't?    I really would find it a bit awkward having to tell a girl what to do!      I only think a Girl can answer this question... I'm just a bit puzzled on what to do or say!?

You all have been dating for about 7 or 8 months….he gets defensive, and you sit there and say nothing, and he calls you insecure and says you are ruining his night, but yet you said nothing, what would you think?  If you ask him later on about who she is and why she is still calling, and he changes the subject like before, what would you think? I never accused him of anything, I just said nothing??
20090220043126AAO3YR9	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What can you do in an abusive/controlling relationship besides leaving them?	I'm currently in an emotionally and mentally abusive/controlling relationship. I know I probably SHOULD leave him but i'm wondering if there are any other options, I know his heart is in the right place, but his head isn't. If he doesn't get his way he starts calling me names, horrible ones like "****" and "slag". Another situation is that he will be going to a strip club this weekend, and though he knows i'd prefer if he didn't, I trust him, and never once told him he couldn't go. I said something about maybe taking photos of my friend's band that night, and he flipped out. He has it in his head that if I want to hang out with anyone but him it's just to 'get back at him' and upset him and i'm playing mind games. Which is NEVER the case. He threatened that 'this is the kind of stuff that's going to make me beat you in the future' (referring to the mind game BS). I also get constantly accused of cheating on him even though I spend all my time with him, and have never cheated on him or in any past relationships.      Is there anything I can do to maybe make him understand my side...?    Or do you think it's inevitable and he'll always be like this?
20090220044001AAv9q0G	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband not thinking straight?	My husband is in the military and right now he has been posted for about a year I stayed behind with the boys cause they were in school. I recently put the house up on the market and started to look for a house where his job is and he went strange on me. Things with us are good so I think, he would come home some weekends and I would drive up there. I was just down there for Valentines day and we had a good night but the next day he went to work first thing in the morning and I drove back home. We live maybe 2 hours away from each other. His job is so demanding on him and he is not allowed to tell me any info on it or where he is going on course, because of this he also changed the password to his bank account so I can't see where he has been. Just this past week he told me to stay here and not to move til he is back from going overseas, and that he doesn't know if we have a future. He told me that he has to sort himself out that things might be fine and he even mentioned renewing our vows or it might come to a divorce. He has become so distant to me and he's not the man he used to be. Do I just give up or wait things out. His parents are going through a seperation and his two brothers one just got a divorce and the other left his girlfriend who has three children, he says this has no effect on him but could it. I feel like talking to his dad that is where he is stayin for the time. I can calm down and wait for him but in a way i'm afriad of the outcome. What do I do, what is going on in his head.....
20090220044241AAVYzRN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend is slowly going insane?	He and I have been together for about a year and a half now. I love him dearly, and have been falling more in love with him since day one. However, I knew that he came with baggage and issues. I just didn't know how severe. He was sexually assaulted at a young age, manipulated by an older girlfriend at thirteen, and his mind is slowly deteriorating. He has attempted suicide two times in the past five years.. and he came close yesterday. He and his mother recently had to move back in with her parents because of extenuating circumstances which fuel the fire in his head. We hardly ever fought; however, in the past few weeks(since he moved), we've constantly been at each others throats. I think it has a lot to do with the fact we used to see each other every other day and now we can only see each other on weekends, but that's just a theory. He feels helpless because he's in a seemingly hopeless situation. (Grandpa's an ex FBI agent.. you get the gist.) What should I do to help him? I refuse to lose him over situations that are out of our control.      He treats me like I'm the most beautiful, special girl in the world. I want to show him that I care about him just as much. Can someone help me figure out how to handle this?      Any advice is appreciated.

20090220051606AAgqcFh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should he really have said this?	Almost 3 years ago I met the man of my dreams, he was going through a divorce at the time and I was single and owned outright my own home. My partner had already agreed with his ex to give her the house that they shared, the contents, the car and caravan and he told me it was for the children. She was a very wealthy woman and I couldnt understand why he was doing this as he would end up penniless and she would have everything. 4 or 5 months into the relationship things were getting serious and we talked about buying a house together, I didnt think it was fair that she should be fleecing him like this and asked him to see a solicitor to try and make things fairer, he refused and would never have me say a wrong thing about her, he even suggested that maybe I and her would be friends, he thought we would "get on" some chance.   He has also refused to get a mortgage with me and even though he asked me to marry him almost 2 years ago I still have no ring.   Well all throught the relationship we have been having problems in the bedroom, he seems to have loads of hang ups and pushes me away sometimes, I have begun to think he is still hung up on her, I have thought this all the way through the relationship. Last night I wanted to discuss why hes like he is with me and he said he thought I had issues with my past, I said "no" I think you have issues with your past and you want to be back with your ex, to this he replied "ok ok i do want to get back with her ok". At this point I stomped off to bed and he hasn't spoken to me yet not even to take back what he said.   What do you make of this?

20090220063407AAJ0uuz	Family & Relationships;Family	My grandparents aren't so grand?	I met my real dad about 2 years ago and I moved in with him at the beginning of the school year (I'm 16) because my mother & stepfather are alcoholics.I get along fine with my dad's wife and their 2 kids, but the problem I'm having is with my dad's family. His parents (my grandparents) don't care for me being there and neither does my aunt & uncle. Whenever we go to family get-togethers they hug my brother's & say to me "Oh we forgot you'd be coming too" even though I've lived here for 7 months now. My birthday was the day after Thanksgiving and not one of them acknowledged it even when my dad brought it up in conversation.   My dad has been arguing with them lately but I don't want my sibling's relationship with their grandparents to be jeopardized cause of me. I had to move out of state to live with my dad and I don't want to change up my life again. Apparently my dad's family considers me a sore subject since my dad was only 20 when I was born and I messed up his college education. Is there anything I can do, or should do to try to get my grandparents to like me? When they come to visit I try to stay out of their way and I don't say anything except for hello & goodbye. I'd be lying if I said that this didn't bother me. I'm so uncomfortable whenever my uncle stops by (he's lives down the street) because he gives me this look like he's saying "you don't belong here."   Any advice is appreciated.

20090220071351AAFhdOi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If I wasn't a good husband does it mean I am a bad father?	I have gone about my divorce in a very wrong way. My wife and I were married for 13 years, together for 17. For the last 3 years we have not been intimate and we have slept on totally different levels of the house. We had talked about separating a few times but she comes from a very religious family where divorce is frowned upon. I tried to make it work, tried bringing the spark back, but ended up being shot down every time.      Typical next chapter to this story... I found a friend at work, who is much younger than I am, and started a friendship with her. She was caring, sweet, understanding, and genuine. Our relationship became more than a friendship before I ended my marriage. This was a mistake, I am a pig, I know. I couldn't stop myself and felt stuck, My wife found out through an email, harrased the girl to no end by calling her at work and home and yelling and screaming. I do not blame her. She kicked me out that night.. called me a lying, cheating, drug addict, horrible father in front of our two young children. It was one of the worst nights of my life. She let me come home the next day. I stayed at home for 2 months and she just didn't talk to me. She probably would have continued the rest of our lives like this. I didn't want to be there besides for my kids, and she didn't love me and must have felt very hurt and betrayed and unhappy. I made the decision to move out. I didn't want to hurt the kids but I didn't think having them grow up to think that's how husband and wife should be, unhappy and never talking (even before the affair).      I see my kids every other weekend and almost every weekday at hockey practice, basketball, gymnastics, piano.      I am still with the girl from work.      I know I was a horrible husband, but does this mean I am a bad father?

He will make any excuse to start an argument for example this morning he started a fight over the issue why I didn't have the breakfast that he had cooked me yesterday...I explained I was running late but he starts to go on one and says things like...Yeah you think you own the world and blah blah.      He will also fight about things that are personal to me and have nothing to do with him. For example what my parents do in their own time has nothing to do with him or even me for the matter but he will bring that up and make it his business. He will give me advice to pass onto them.       He is driving me crazy with this and then when I get angry he tries to make up. And he will say you take it too serious ...but I know I don't because let him get away with it too far. I've had enough...what should I do???

He more-less gave up caring at the ultra sound when we found out we were having a girl. As of today we hardly ever talk and i may have received at the most 6 child support payments from him in the 5 years.   OK, So, almost 2 years ago I was talking to his brother over the computer and we made plans to take our kids to see a movie. So we did and from that day we started "talking". He said from the beginning  he didn't want a relationship (bc he just spent 9 years in one and also bc of my daughter being his niece). Well I did what I wasn't suppose to do and fell in love and he did too not long after i did.

I waited for him to realize that he needed me in his life for 6 months, he told me that he loved me and that I was important to him and nothing I would talk to him he would come over to the house for "sleepovers" and then nothing for two up to four weeks later. So I took as I was just something that he "played" with, nothing real. So after our last sleepover nothing for 3 weeks so when I spoke to him about it I thought I was sure that I was right even though he told me that he loved me I knew that it was superficial or so I thought....I started dating another guy and we have gotten serious now my ex is texting me wanting to know why I lied to him. I don't feel that I lied granted I didn't tell him but I did try to tell him that I was moving on I mean after 6 months of being a bootycall what did he expect? Now he loves me and has loved me since we were 12 and now we are knocking on 30's door. Why couldn't he tell me before I move on before I gave up on him? I mean nothing for over two months and now that he see's that I am happy in this life. With this wonderful man that loves me and my kids. and here he comes confessing his love. What the heck!!!

She lied to me 2 weeks ago and ditched me for another guy and she claims they are just getting to know each other. I am torn up and I do not know what to do. She did it all threw texts and now barely gives me the time of day. I know I should hate her but I am just having a hard time dealing with it. I haven't seen her in a month and a half and she wont even give me one last chance to see her. What do i do?
20090219234106AAHuqbx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls , how many of you would like to kick a man in his balls just for no reason at all.?	I have read alot of posts , and girls think they are becoming dominant in the world today and i think someone needs to set them straight and remind them that they are the weaker sex.Women kick men in the balls all the time just to feel powerful. have you ever kicked a man ?? what did he do ?? how did you react to it ?? Now women may be rising up , and dont get me wrong by saying this , but you should try to put yourself next to us instead of trying to be better than us, forget it , it wont happen

20090220044712AASuMYJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I wrong to feel this way?	My 10 month old daughter is teething, all 4 top front teeth coming in at the same time.  She is not sleeping well because of it.  Last night she was up at 8pm, midnight and 3:30am.  Finally at 3:30am I lost it.  My husband was up watching TV (he works nights) and I went into the living room and was loud telling him that she was up again.  I told him I was worn out and couldn't handle it being that I had to wake up at 5am to get ready for work and get her ready for daycare.  Instead and being understanding he got mad at me?!  I wasn't mad at him or her I was mad at the situation!  I just wanted some help and being that he gets to sleep all day today I thought he'd step up and help?!  He just got ruder and ruder and I ended up having to stay up with her rocking her back to sleep and sobbing my eyes out with no sympathy or compassion or HELP from my husband.  Was I wrong to be mad at the fact that I was awake at 3:30am and had gotten no sleep?
20090220055547AAzhdIl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Question about a girl I really like?	I really this girl that I work with. About a month ago her and I went on a ski trip with our work. We didn't really ski much but we talked the whole time and I made her smile and laugh a lot and we were both having a terrific time. At the end of the day I asked her for her number and she gave it to me. I let a few days pass and when I saw her at work I asked her If it would be alright if I called her later. She said "sure I'm not really doing anything later." I called her and we talked a bit and then we hung out that night and talked for hours and we had an awesome time. Towards the end of the night I asked her about her situation. She informed me that there were other men that liked her but that she was at the moment available. I went home and left her alone for a while. She texted me the next night wondering about how large my wrist was because she had decided to make me a bracelet (she makes various necklaces and bracelets from hemp and beads and such.) I responded to her text and asked her if she maybe wanted to do something the following night. She said that she didn't know if she could or not for sure but would get back to me. The next night I called her and left a message asking if she had figured out what she was gonna do. She sent me a text a few hours later saying that she had forgotten that it was her friends birthday and that she was going to hang out with her. I responded saying ok and that I would talk to her later. The next day at work I saw and talked to her a bit and then I asked her if she wanted to hang out after work. She agreed to and gave me directions to get to her house. I went to her house and met her mother who was really nice. I waited for her to come down and out of her room. When she came down she looked amazing and I told her so. We hung out for the rest of the night doing various things we went shopping a bit. I began to make a move on her. I started by trying to hold her hand and by touching her to show that I liked her. (I realize now that maybe I just should have said something to her about how I felt, I guess I just figured she already knew.) Anyways, at the end of the night because she was not really responding to any of my advances I just finally asked her to come closer to me while we were sitting on the couch. It was at this point that she informed me that she was seeing this other guy and that she feels gross if she does stuff with other people. I told her that I understood. She then preceded to tell me that her friend was coming to pick her up and that I would have to leave. (This was after I noticed her texting her friend a bunch.) Anyways, I sent her a text a couple of days later saying that I hope that this wouldn't make things awkward between us and that I was ok with just being friends. I made sure to not let the entire situation be awkward at work. I took control of the atmosphere and we still talk to this day even and we still really enjoy each other and get along quite well. Now here are my questions. Do you think that maybe I just didn't express my interest in her well enough, or maybe wasn't vocal enough about my interest in her? Do you think that maybe I smothered her by wanting to hang out so much? (I wasn't really thinking about this because I was undoubtedly having such a good time.) If I would've just asked her out would've her reaction been different than just me trying to show my affection?  Or do you just think maybe this other guy got to her first? Nowadays when I see her she laughs at my jokes (sometimes even when I don't think what I am saying is particularly funny.) She touches me now which is something that she didn't use to do. (This could be innocuous, but I thought I would mention it.) Do you think based on what you have read that she liked me? How about does she still like me? If you think so, what do you think I should do from here? Thanks for taking the time to read all of this and I hope to hear some good answers.

20090220052615AAdspIx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I doing the right thing?	I am leaving my husband on Monday.  We have been together for what would of been 5 years next months, we got married last June.      He was diagnosed with MS in October 2007, while we were planning out wedding.  People said that I am mistake by marrying someone who is ill.  I could not leave him because I loved him and I was with him so long before his illness, plus it would not of looked good on me if I left him as soon as he fell ill.      I am 25, he is 36.  Since he was diagnosed he has alienated me, lashed out at me and has been really abusive.  He will not let me speak, he is like a dictator and he tends to patronise me.  He tends to fly off the handle alot and he refuses to help me (like if I ask him to pass something to me, he will tell me to get it myself)      He moans about paying the rent, saying that he does not want to do it because before I came on the scene he had benefits.  I have been made redundant and I could not pay the rent, so he moans that I should pay it (how can I when I have no money?)      He thinks I am bluffing.  I really want to leave but I will feel guilty for doing it.

20090220062253AAIWHeN	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is It Wrong For Me To Want A Husband Who Is...........?	able to be a good provider?      I work, always have and always will.  Why should I be condemned for wanting a husband who can provide for our family just like I do?  One who can pick up the slack if i am ill or tired just like I will for him....      This question stems from a conversation last night with a "friend" who decided I was just looking for a husband to take care of me and my children.      I, of course, was insulted.  He had me mixed up with women from his past.  Insulted is an understatement of how I really felt.  He keeps forgetting who I am and its wearing on our friendship.

20090220005550AASRJGD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Mature answers...should I flirt with her friends?  Would that be rude?	We're in our 20s, known her for a few months. I told her I had feelings for her, she said she didn't. I said suggested we not be friends, as we wanted different things, and I couldn't be a great friend if I liked her, and she started crying at the restaurant. So after we took a month break, we tried friends again.  The thing is, we both know that my feelings for her is a problem.  We can be so close, calling each other everyday for hours, to distant.  Everytime we get into a fight, she thinks I am going to leave, and she gets upset and insists everything is good.  We were on a "break" from our friendship, when she called on Valentine's evening, we talked for a few hours, and she invited me to her party at this lounge.      I guess liking her really isn't going anywhere, but I still want her to be honest. I started seeing someone else, but nothing serious. Should I flirt with her friends at the lounge? Would that be considered rude?
20090220002826AAcmnNO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Serious answers!  Should I flirt at her birthday party?	We're in our 20s, known her for a few months.  I told her I had feelings for her, she said she didn't.  I said suggested we distance ourselves, and she started crying at the restaurant.  So I tried friends even though I told her my feelings for her would always be there.  Later on, I told her I needed a month break from her because I still liked her, she got upset there.  Last month she told me she needed a break from me for a few weeks, we didn't say anything, but we both knew it was because I still had feelings for her.  She broke the break by calling me on Valentine's night, and invited me to her party at a lounge.  The thing is, we constantly go from being very close, calling each other everyday for hours, and having dinners often, to being distant.        I guess liking her really isn't going anywhere, but I still want her to be honest.  I started seeing someone else, but nothing serious.  Should I flirt with her friends at the lounge?  Would that be considered rude?

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np.

20090220050455AAd6ZF4	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My friends or myself?  What's more important?	For a long time, I have been a highly-sensitive person, let my emotions control me, lacked self-esteem and confidence.  I've never had many friends in my life as my socialising skills aren't very high (the causes for them are private, yet genuine and understandable reasons for the way I am).  I'm happy to say I have a few, true friends in my life whom I'm very close to.       In the early spring of 2008, during the aftermath of the most INCREDIBLY EMOTIONAL experience I ever had to face, I came away with a huge, definate decision...if I'm going to survive in life and be happy, I NEED to toughen myself up!      Ever since then, I have been making a conscious effort to toughen myself up, both emotionally and physically.  I fell in love with self-help books (they're very inspiring), enjoy doing self-hypnosis and have started attending all kinds of activities that allows me to socialise with other people and have began to make some new friends along the way.      To put this all into short....I am toughening myself up and finally taking control of my life.      So far, I have been making wonderful progress as I have already noticed the changes in my life, the way people act towards me and I can even FEEL the changes.  Some people I have met along my way towards my new-self have said how much they admire me for my strength and confidence.  I no longer feel so scared and needing to run to others for help.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  I've actually had people coming to ME for advice and help and I've been so proud that I can actually help my friends and other people for a change, as I have shared their experiences.      My family have also noticed my gradual change in the type of music I like to listen to, the movies I like to watch and even my change in thoughts towards certain situations.      Here is what is stopping me from reaching my goal to my new, confident-self.      Like I said before, I have a few, true friends in my life who care about me very much and have been there for me through the good and bad times.  However, when they first met me, they got to know and like the OLD me, but what will they think about the new me?      What happens when I finally fulfill my dream, turn my life around and become the tougher, more confident person I've always wanted to be, only for my friends to not like the new me and leave me?        I want to fulfill my wish to become a stronger, more confident person, but I don't want to lose my friends.      How do you choose between your friends and yourself?      Thank you.

20090220051520AAx1uH3	Family & Relationships;Family	How to deal with my dad?	my dad has so many things against me. not in serious matters like abusing me or something, but because of just simple things building up over time, which is why i really hate him until today.   i cant remember when it all started, but i know, its because of simple disagreements.   i know, im just a teen, and it's parents job blablabla, no need to tell that to me. i know that.   i dont like my father forcing me to go somewhere unimportant. the mall for example.   he doesnt really know i hate him, its my secret.   even though im just forced to do it, i still do it, cuz i cant do anything about it. hes my father(even though i dont want to)      he really likes to pry my stuffs, my body(face, eyes, teeth, etc), what im doing blabla...   why is it such a big deal to him, its not his, so why worry?   because im his son?   cuz he loves me? concerned?   if he loves me then he should trust me, right? that i wont do anything wrong?   PS i dont do drugs, dont smoke, dont drink, ont drive, dont have premarital sex r whatever, im basically a normal teenager with normal problems,       the only time i feel happy is when im with my friends, or maybe sometimes hen im alone.   im almost never happy with my family.      and oh i seldom talk to my dad, if i do, i talk in short sentences. i dont really like talking to him.

20090220061502AAjuZaT	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Girls night cancelled, now what?	Our girls night out was canceled - some "bug" is going around...the real bummer is that our house was slated to be completely empty (daughter going to a sleepover) so my husband can have the guys over for a guy night.  It's the first time in 5 years that we've been able to pull this off for him.  He gets plenty of guy time out but is so excited to be having his crew by.  I am down to nobody available to go out with (sick people - what are they thinking?) and needing to make alternative plans to give the guys their space.  I know my husband wouldn't mind me staying (I used to hang out with the guys a lot...) but I really want him to have his friends all to himself.      Anyone have any suggestions on what to do tonight?
20090220064126AAYEupV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Peepz, should she or not? Help! -love and marriages-?	I've a great girl friend who came to me one day... I'm not sure how to reply to her, so I need y'all to help me with it :)      Firstly, her dad has a mistress and a family outside and was in debts. her mom gotta work and pay off all the debts. (btw they were once a very rich family). She is really very sad, she has no trust in guys too, because of her ex mistreated her, took her for granted, etc.      She knows a guy friend for almost 8 years. He's really rich, he likes her a lot... but she doesnt like the guy at all. They are of different culture, color but of course, same belief.       He told her that he would want to marry her and give her everything she wants, but my girl friend doesnt believe him and of course, doesn't like him.      But seeing her mom, pitying her mom instead (her mom doesnt know about the hubby's affair), she wants to give her a good life, and knowing that if she marries to this guy, she'll lead a very good life, so does her mom. But she'll afraid her dad would take the materials stuffs for granted and hurt her mom. (i'm not sure about the r/s with her parents till here...)      Her mom bugs her to marry this rich guy (4 years her senior), as she doesn't want my friend to suffer much - she wants my friend to lead a good life.      My friend tried to like this guy but she can't. But on the other hand, she wants to give her mom happiness and retire from the working environment.       What should my friend do?       *she believes in not shortchange herself in life, but then... it's really tough to decide...*      Please give me (us) the suggestions. Thanks.
20090220013847AAX7nva	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you like long stupid relationship questions? Then this one's for you! How do I get him to like me again?	How do I get him to like me again? Going from apathetic to suddenly expressing myself does not work for him!      So I like my best friend, since ever and well I once talked to him about it (I'm very apathetic and I have big issues from the past and so it's complicated) after the first time I didn't really do much to fix the situation I went back to being apathetic and he assumed I stopped liking him. His feelings that he had for me are now long gone and here's some stuff he said in our conversations to give you a better idea on the situation, please tell me what I can do to get him to like me again.      him: it seems like you're in a hurry to express some feeling because of certain people on my facebook   which seem to fight against you with the comments      me: well it's not really about those people, you said I had a slim chance and I don't want to lose it and go back to my usual self where I don't express anything      him: you're practically my best friend.. at one point i felt more but now i don't want to give you false hopes      me: well it is kind of annoying knowing that you talk to women that can express themselfs freely and I can't, even though you say they're annoying I just can't help being annoyed by it, since it's something I'm unable to do      him: i understand   i just cant promise that ill feel that way towards you again   the worst is that i dont want you to ever end up hating me   i dont want to explain how it could have been different because there's nothing you can do about the past   id wish i have the same feelings for you again   since you're so awesome   but i guess i cant force it      and then some more stuff where I said how it's hard for me cause I'm very apathetic and I suddenly have to show all this emotion and blah blah and he said:      it just doesn't work that way   for me   after all this time from apathetic to different   as in its nice to understand how you feel   but you did it wrong.. at the wrong time   you end up being alone in it   and it'll just hurt and scar you even more wouldn't it   i wish you'd behave this way a long time ago   right now i don't know what i can do with it   i shouldn't have to feel so bad for something that isn't my fault.. ive been around in all aspects   i don't feel romantic like that anymore   even though i feel even closer to you as a friend   after everything we've gone through   and i cant promise that ill feel romantic like that again   who knows what will happen in the future   we're friends anyway thats whats important   and no one can tell what will happen in the future   i hope you feel better   dont feel bad about this since we're comfortable around each other   by now i hope   you can talk about anything   as much as i know its hard.. even this is nothing for us since we're comfortable with each other   i hope you remember that   and be less afraid to talk about things      I want him to like me again, I screwed up and I tried writing on his page online stuff about how I feel and this other girl got jealous and was posting stuff too and it kind of was heading towards a comment war but I stopped don't want it to be that way, it's just she annoys me cause she wants him too and she can actually express her feelings.      Also just to add, he recently dreamt me 3 times, but not the usual way, twice we did something, and once he was watching me you know... he said he was shocked he had such dreams about me and didn't expect them and doesn't know why it's happening, like his subconscious is acting! can that mean anything? or maybe it's normal!   oh and if it's of any use we're best friends for almost 2 years!

20090220055629AASTq61	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you dump a friend?	Like, dump as in how do I tell my friend I don't want us to be friends anymore?      I hate her with a passion.   It's been three and a half long years.    I honestly, always thought she was hella annoying, but I put up with her till now.   She only has me and this other girl as friends. And she always calls me when the other is busy. And it's really annoying because one: I don't want to be a back up person because I have my own friends, and two: I just don't want to make plans with her.   Everybody is telling me to leave her, but I don't know what to do because I'm her longest, friend, and...without me...she only has one.... but I really can't stand her.       And honestly, I'm a nice person. I can be a ***** at times, but like, honestly, I'm wicked sweet usually. It's just this one girrrlllll !!!! >:[[ !!!!!      I think I want to leave her... but I don't want to be mean because then she'll tell people what a horrible person I am, and well.. haha I can't blame her right now. But like, she tends to over exagerate bigtime.
20090220051036AAPMowi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help...Wife is Depressed and I Don't Know What to do...?	My wife tells me last night the she is depressed about her weight.  We have been eating right since the beginning of the year and she has lost about 10 pounds but recently has put about 3 pounds back on.  She is upset about it.  She is not huge by any means.  She has belly fat from having a baby but that is about it.  We are trying to conceive and have been for the past 6 months.  She could be pregnant now.  She has some symptoms of pregnancy and I have noticed her breasts getting really big.  But she made the comment last night the she is afraid that if she gets pregnant she is going to gain so much weight and be over 200 pounds.  She is so stressed because she is in nursing school full time, she is trying to be a good mom, and a good wife.  I do everything I can to make her feel beautiful and let her know that I love her.  I write her a letter daily telling her how much I love her and I do all the laundry, the dishes nightly, most cleaning of the house, and take care of the little guy and dog 90% of the time.  So I do not understand why she is stressed and depressed.  What can I do to help her?  I am trying to be supportive but she doesn't care how beautiful I think she is.  If she doesn't think it, my words do not mean anything.  Any help please...???

20090220053504AAxAa2T	Family & Relationships;Family	Help with emotional abuse?	I am a 22 year old girl, married no kids as yet, married since june of 2008. i would like peoples sincere opinions on what i believe to be emotional abuse from my mother. if i were to write all the probs i have had with her down i would not have enough room on here so i will explain my most recent dilemma, about 7 months ago my mother left my father and she moved out on her own due to physical abuse on his part, myself and my husband let her move in with us for about a month until she found her own place, i was there for her through thick and thin, then she moved back with him after about 3 months of living on her own, this hurt me a lot as i had taken a lot of time off work to help her and pretty much put my life on hold until she got sorted. she then ignored me after moving back with my father for 3/4 months i hadnt heard from her, evantually we got back on talking terms and things went from there. i am presently starting to have a legal battle againt my father regarding property and at the start of this my mother was like go for it sarah you will be fine ETC. Just yesterday out of the blue she lashes out at me and says that she is not getting involved with any of this as it has nothing to do with her, that i do not have a prob with but what she said next really did shock me, she said i have been beaten over you since you were knee high and im not going to be beaten again because of you. May i add i moved out with my now husband at the ripe age of 16 because i could not live with them anymore. there is more to the story but would rather not ramble on on this. i have really had enough of my mothers behaviour and i feel that no commuinication with her would be the only solution as she doesnt listen when i speak to her or try to explain why i am upset with her. Anyone who has experienced a similar situation i would love to hear from you, or if anyone could recemend what i could do ? many thanks in advance......

20090220054926AANmGrt	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I right to be annoyed that my stepfather wants me to lie to my car insurance company?	I hit a median during a white out snow storm early in December last year. The police report makes it clear that I was not liable for any damages to a sign that I bumped into and that the cause of the accident was poor road conditions, not poor driving.       My insurance company asked me to give them a statement and interviewed the passenger in the car as well. Obviously they want me to tell them something that will allow them to jack up my rates but the police report would seem to prevent that. My stepdad ,however, wants me to lie to them about the fact that I hit the sign, how much the damage to vehicle was (I scrapped it since it was totaled), and about the fact that my passenger was drunk.      My parents pay for most of my insurance, but I don't think that means they can tell me to lie to the claims department . I keep telling him that I told the insurance company the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth... but yet he still wants me to call them up and lie to them... despite having already given the police, accident report dept. and the claims dept. the same exact statement (I have it written down). He's become so difficult about this that I can't even stand to be in the same room as he is for more than 5 minutes at a time.

I'm confused. I'm not really mad because i don't make a big deal out of it but why does he keep insulting me in a joking way? like testing my patience or something. it hurts too but i kinda don't think about it because he's joking. what does he want from me????         he embarrassed me in front of a crowd of strangers and they gave me bad looks. then he pulled me outside the crowd and apologized. he said it wasn't what he meant and he was sorry. but then again he did it. (on purpose i guess)   he keeps taunting me and since we go home from school together, he keeps asking me to poke his cheeks. i dont know why he likes it. he said it feels nice because my hands are soft ( i dont think so). suddenly he tickles me. because he knows i cant stand it. i just cant understand him.      we are a group of friends okay and he's the only one acting weird.

20090220060327AAJ0Ntl	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding Date Problems!...?	Okay so my fiance sat down one day and looked at a calendar.  We eliminated the months that had holidays and our birthdays.  Then eliminated the months that had too much going on it.  Then decided that we wanted to have a fall wedding.  Then decided that it had to be on a sat because we are military and it would be easier to get married on a sat and out of those 4 days we decided on the 22nd due to it being close to a payday.  Now.  We came up with this date a LONG time ago like before we got engaged. Then when we got engaged in Oct. We told everyone the date and reminded them at Christmas when we asked the bridesmaids to be in the wedding.  Now we had all the bridesmaids try on their dresses so far and we bought their jewelry which was EXTREMELY expensive all which said that they would be in the wedding and could come. Now I find out this week that 3 brides maids, 1 groomsmen, 1 photographer, the father, step father, and step mother of the groom will not be coming. Due to vacations planned and other conflicts.  This is the date that we fell in love with and everyone already knows its on this date. Now I don't know what to do! I am really big on family and really want his family to be at our wedding.

20090220045407AAKoRCc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he acting this way?	Sunday, I called my boyfriend up and told that I didn't want to be with him anymore. He got angry and asked why and I told him my reasons. Then he was like, he doesn't want us to break things off so of course, being a fool, I decided to stay. Now he's acting the same way he was before.       Why are guys like that? How can they be so inconsiderate but then expect you to stay?

20090220002224AAsVU0J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does it bother you when?	People on here say they weigh 98 pounds yet they still think they're morbidly obese...      Or when people post pictures of themselves asking if they're fat or ugly when they're clearly not?         How much of it do you think is for attention and how many of these psychos do you think are really being serious?

20090220045516AArnoht	Family & Relationships;Friends	Best friend... I think we are drifting apart?	Hey, my best friend and I have been as close as anything for about 3 and a half years now. It seems nothing, but straight away our personalities clicked and we shared the same interests opinions and humour.       However, these days I just feel she is very childish and spoilt, and she will only ever think of herself. I feel she is very competivitve and when I just want to lay back and have a good time she always has to add in some rude remark. I'm very certain that I am not perfect either, and so is she, seeing as to her it is always my fault. But whenever I am around my best friend I just know inside I really don't get on with her any more. Has she changed? Have I? Am I in the wrong? It started when we were starting to work towards our exams (happening in a few months) so maybe that triggered it. I feel like a nasty best friend, and our other friends like us both, so if we fell out, me being the quieter one, i'm sure I would end up friendless. I am between a rock and a hard place, but the longer it goes on, the more dominating she gets. What do you think?
20090220045915AAzBeL4	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is she really my best friend?	My best friend of 5 years, from childhood times. I love her so much and she was always my special friend but now things quite arent the same anymore. I knoe we all grow and change but i dont know what ive done wrong and i have talked to her about it but nothing seems to change. Shes just starting to ignore me...she doesnt call me for months or nothing. She does call me sometimes really unexpectedly but she acts like everything is fine but then ignores my calls and texts again. I dont feel like i can talk to her anymore or about my problems  because i dont feel close with her. and it hurts me that she has time to talk to her other friends. SHould i move on from her because i dont feel like shes a best friend anymore.

20090220061916AAok0NO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can you tell if he likes me.?	I have this guy friend and we've been friends since like 1st grade and we're in 9th now, but all of a sudden he has been acting weird.  I only have one class with him and we don't have signed seats soo he ALWAYS have to sit next to me.  And when we go to the computer lab I save two seats for my other friends and he comes and sits there, but his friends says moves up and he says i wanna sit here.  I'm really confused, he looks me in the eyes when talking to me, and he tries to make me laugh and succeeds, he also tries to get my attention a lot, like throwing stuff at me.  And if I look over at him and he was looking at me or somewhere else and he just looks and smile and turns around and blushes very lightly.  HELP!       If he just a friend or does he like me.       Sorry if this was a little confusing.

20090220063155AAli5nU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex wifes cant all be this bad?	Im pretty new at this and ive asked a few questions now, ive had mainly positive answers and only a one or two negative ones. Will someone look at all my questions and tell me i arent moaning or nagging! Im just looking for a solution to my problem at the moment as im running out of ideas. Ive tried most things, ive been patient, polite ,ive tried stepping back, been back court, been mediation, my husband has tried smoothing things over but nothing works. Its just so frustrating, also does anyone know what the chances of us getting more visitation? Our last solicitor wasnt that good really, as a result we only have the children every fortnight. We would like to have them for a full week in the school holidays, is this possible? And can the courts put it on to paper that we can take the children the hairdressers? At the moment we cant do that as she wont let us and programs it in the childrens heads that if we do they will never see us again, she even went beserk about them getting temporary tattoos they got from childrens magazines! She recently started complaining about us going to their school plays too! A few years ago just before my husband met me he wanted to take his children disney land but his ex refused and still does even now. Its driving me mad. Thanks to all the people who have got back to me positivly its nice hearing your opinion and i know im not the only one going through this nightmare!

20090220054055AAezgrl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Who is being selfish here me or my husband?	I just want some outside opinions. My husband works full time and is a part time student. I am a stay at home mom of our four kids ages 8,6,2 and 5 months, and have been for 8 years. I bend over backwards to do everything for everyone. My husband does not help around the house or with the kids at all, he says that is MY JOB. When he is home he sits on the couch and drinks beer, AND THAT IS ALL. My issue is that he spends no money on me or our kids, ever. He buys whatever he wants and i get nothing. We have one family vehicle and he drives it, so i am left with no car on a daily basis. He promised me that when he had the money he would get another car so i could have one too and not be a prisoner in my own home. I have to call other people to go get my kids from school when they are sick.Well when we got the money he bought a Harley instead of another car.Which only gives me a car a few months out of the year.He has promised to buy me things this year that i need and he is already spending the money on thousnads of dollars worth of guns, that he think he needs to have.He spends all the extra money at the end of the month on him.Mostly like stuff he wants and about 100.00 a month in beer. I have not bought new clothes in years or anything for my kids. The money is always all gone and i have to ask my mom to help me buy things for our kids if they need them.He says that if i want to buy things i should get a job. That is not possible because we cannot afford to put the babies in daycare, and i have no one who will watch them so i can work. Day care would cost us about 2000 a month. Am i really not entiled to anything in this marraige till i have a job, or is my husband a jerk?

20090220061910AAtKJCP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do in my situation?	long story short, my wife had an affair and we are divorcing. Its got really nasty through no fault of my own. I bumped into the wife of the bloke my wife had the affair with, she is divorcing him as well. We get on really well, i like her and we have supported each other through this. My wifes new relationship is based on lies that she tells him that i used to do to her etc and his is the same so there has been loads of slagging off about us. The fact is she is actually quite a good catch and is very very pretty now the problem is that they dont know that me and the other wife have been talking and now the divorce is nearly over they are gonna find out. i'm not seeing the woman in that way but my wife is going to accuse me of "seeing her" and i feel like saying yes i am, she is also not getting on with this bloke very well and my children tell me all they do is argue. I feel like playing along with it just to get a little payback. What would you do?

Decided to text this girl I just met who I thought might be interested in me (well I did her number). I think she responded pretty positively, some laughing (like after I addressed her as babe), and pretty quick responses. She never asked who I was so she obviously remembered. But I don't know if it's because she's interested or because she's just being friendly, so wanted to see what other women think (it's easier for me to make a move when I know the girl's interested). Thanks.

20090220005000AAupXjz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was talking to a girl and she lost interest suddenly(women help!)?	Ive been talking to this girl for a little over three months and we have gone on numerous dates and i had a lot of fun with her, i eventually told her i liked her after two months and she told me she liked me back so i took it for what it was and continued to hang out and text all day everyday, anyways she suddenly started acting like she didnt really care to talk to me, she would barely respond to my texts and give me short one word answers as well as declining offers to study for classes we have together. Its been three weeks since shes been acting this way and i decided not to bug her and probably texted her once or twice during the entire three weeks, i just talked to her last night and called her out on it asking her what the deal was, she proceeded to tell me that she just had a lot going on in her life at the moment. I asked her for some more details so she finally admitted to me that she was seeing a guy. Is it wrong for me to feel like what she did was messed up and that she should have at least told me she was into someone else or am i just being selfish? I really liked this girl despite the fact that she was more of the party type and likes to drink alot when i dont party nor drink. When we talked last night i told her i wasnt pursuing her if thats why she was acting wierd and she replied with a text saying "you dont like me anymore ? :(" and i told her that she doesnt feel the same way so i kinda didnt care anymore but in reality i really do. She was texting me like normal today but this time i was being the cold one and not really responding. I dont want to seem like the desperate guy who doesnt get hints and i dont want her to feel like she can just have me whenever she wants. Should i continue to act like i don't care with hopes shell come around or will that have the opposite affect?       I apologize for the long post i just wanted to give you guys a better understanding of where im coming from.

All my life my older brother has treated me like crap, he used to beat the crap out of me but now that I am older it's starting to turn into more mental attacks. I hate my brother but I can't go to my mum because in her eyes he is perfect and I will always be second best. All my brother does is sit around smoking and on the X-box 360 all day and he is 20 yet he still has no job and is still living with us.       He really gets into my head, I know this sound's sick but I honestly wish my brother was dead and I hate that, but he always pushes me around and I have no self confidence becuase of this. He has just destroyed my child hood and I am worried about how this will affect my future.   I have tried to move out and move in with my dad but he can't look after me because he had a stroke last year, I don't want to move in with any of my family as my borther is perfect in their eyes. I hate my brother and I know this may sound like a case of brother wars but I just hate the sight of him and he really is playing with my kind, I don't know what to do, what shiuld I do?

20090220052041AAEiMsl	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Based on my birth chart, what signs am I attracted to?	I'm an Aquarius, Scorpio rising, moon in Capricorn. Other planets are: Venus and Mars in Aries, Mercury and Jupiter in Aquarius, Saturn and Pluto in Scorpio, Uranus in Sagittarius and Neptune in Capricorn. I was wondering what does my birth chart generally say about me and what signs am I attracted to because I most commonly find myself attracted to either a Scorpio or an Aries man? Why is this so, does my birth chart have anything to do with that? What aspects reveal this? What sort of a relationship should I expect with a Scorpio man with Aquarius rising?

20090220011132AAxwMox	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I found the perfect man, but...?	He is married to someone else. This is someone that I admire greatly. When I met him I realized all the qualities that are important to me to find in a husband. He is someone who makes you want to be a better person. He is always happy like a small child, and someone who seems to really love life and living. He's someone whose goodness you can believe in with your whole heart. Also he's very intelligent and caring. I've never seen children who love their father like his love him. How rare is it to meet someone like this? Am I likely to find another?

20090220043424AAmoQtc	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you ever "divorced" would you try to reconnect or get back w/an ex BF/GF?	I'm just curious. I know so many people who claim they're "over their ex's" even when married to someone else. Then, years later, when things dont work ot for them(divorce, etc), they think of their ex gf/bf and want to reconnect with them. it's happened to 2 of my friends, and they couldnt be happier. They married someone else, and when things didnt work out, they tried to mend things w/an ex. Is this wise, does this happen? what are YOUR thoughts on this? keep in mind, you've both  shared yourselves w/each other, and time together. There was a spark there @ once, regardless of what happend. Would you try to rekindle something w/an ex if you current relationship didnt work out?

It just happened, he said that he loved being around me.   That i was so much fun to be around with.      None has ever said that to me.

20090220010924AAQKYAf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend wants me to control his horny-ness..?	My boyfriend of 2 1/2 years gets horny just as much as regular guys, if not more often.  But he says that it takes him too long to get himself off and wants me to 'help him' or do it for him and that sometimes he feels weird getting himself off.  Oftentimes when I don't see him for days and he's horny, he will just not 'address the issue' himself, so by the time he sees me he is worked up to begin with.  This puts a lot of pressure on me to do him favors, and I don't think that's right.  I think he should be able to control his own 'hormones' and not put the burden on me.  Even though we have discussed this explicitly, I'm pretty sure he still expects me to take responsibility for his hormones, even when I'm not in the mood.  I think this is unfair.  Do you think I should just continue to be the nice [perhaps taken-advantage-of] girlfriend and help him whenever he wants?  Or am I justified in feeling used?  *bonus question*  Is this injustice a good tidbit to put in the arsenal of reasons to break up with him, if I choose to do so?

20090220055025AAO63hA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i go  back to him?	Ok this is a long story but ill try make it short.   Beginning of December me and my ex fiancee broke up after 3 years. It was over something very stupid but our relationship did seem to be on the rocks seeing as we argued continuously for months after I found out he cheated. The problem is he can't resist girls that like him. He loves the attention they give him and he seems to be one hell of a girl magnet. And although he won't sleep with them he still likes to meet up  with other and all. It bothers me cause I know they want him. So when he cheated it all went down hill and i did something stupid too. He dumped me and acted like he hated me and got another girlfriend 3 weeks later. I took a couple weeks away from him and got my head straight and now I feel like a different person and I got use to the idea of not being with him although i love him VERY  much he means the world to me.   He broke up wit h his gf over the weekend and yesterday when I called he asked me to re-think marrying him. He said he's always been in love with me and didn't wanna say cause he didn't find it appropriate while having a gf and he could never have what he had with me with anyone else cause i'm the girl of his dreams etc    I love him so so much but i don't know what to do!   He will never change from his ''player'' ways and i don't know if i can handle that!
20090220005623AAAMpFC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he still love me?	I've been living with my boyfriend for nearly 2 months and we have a 10 week old son together, we are both 16. He says he loves me but i find it hard to believe him, because i am self conscious about my body as i still have my pregnancy weight and don't like the way i look and i have no confidence. He tells me that i am fine the way i am and that he loves me. He's never cheated on me before and we've been together for 2 years, i don't want to doubt him more than what i already do as i don't want him to end up finishing with me also i tell him that i don't think that he loves me and that i am fat, it's starting to get on his nerves but i can't help the way that i am feeling. What can i do to overcome this?

Not to mention she's so doubtful of a new relationship. She texts me random stuff saying, her flaws will push me away.. and when i try to show her to relax and take it slow, she says she's ruining it with me      Please if anyone has insight on to what is going through this girls mind, please please please let me know.      P.S. She broke up with her boyfriend about 6 months ago, so i don't know if she's still not over him, she always says what an asshole he is, etc.

I'm a broadcasting student in high school and on all of my major projects this girl always wants to be my partner, now I wouldn't mind normally but she freaks out over every little thing for example: I was interviewing someone and I guess she giggle very softly, she totally started to freak out and she told me to reshoot it (I told her no of course). And now I never want to work with her again how do I tell her without hurting her feelings.

20090220004457AAIYV5b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I Do About My "relationship?"?	I currently am having a problem. My ex boyfriend and I broke up about two months ago.  We were together for over a year.I really do love him more than anything. Now there's this guy, i really like him. Unfortunately the only sort of relationship we could have is one where i have sex with him. So I did. I figured that if I gave him the same sort of expression of love  I gave my ex I wouldn't have such a hard time moving on in life. Unfortunately, the guys I had sex with also has a girlfriend and a baby on the way. :/ I knew about the baby but he didn't tell me about his girlfriend, i don't know what to do now. My ex found out and is quite upset with me. What should I do from here in order to deal with my new found promiscuity? How can I make my ex understand why I did it. :/ Does anyone even understand why I did It. (of course I realize it wasn't worth it and didn't work.)
20090220004946AAL3kPL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend of 6yrs emailing another man.?	My fiance and I have been together for a long time and have been engaged the last year.       Anyway, I stumble upon her email account looking for an old email address and I find a large list of emails from another man. She has only briefly talked about meeting this guy while she was on vacation but the substance I found in the emails seemed to be extremely personal. She mentions nothing of me and avoids telling him of my family and has written things like, I wish you were here, when can you come, I miss the company, I can't wait to see you again. They share the exact same beliefs etc.       The final thing that worries me is that they have talked about the memories they share at a specific area they were at on holidays in a secret discourse. I am going completely insane, I don't know what to think considering she obviously is avoiding or hasn't told this guy that she's in a relationship we me. ARRGH, what the hell do I do???? I don't understand because there is nothing wrong with our relationship, why would she even consider keeping her option open or maybe she thinks she's found something better than me.      Should I confront her on this or wait and see what happens considering he is not in the country????

Ok the guy i like is actually my classmate and he's been giving me signs of liking me (asking for my msn, staring at me, making me laugh, asked me to skip class with him and go on a drink, etc...) and i've been returning them btw.      so he came back from skiing and sent me a msg on msn while i was offline. when i came online i replied but msn had some troubles and it said that the msg wasn't delivered.   so i sent it again, but he didn't reply. and it didn't say that it wasn't delivered.   so i clicked him the next day and he replied right away, but stopped replying after 2 or 3 msgs.

20090220021206AAxDe6w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not an average virgin....I think?	I am 21 years old and obviously still a virgin. I am not an average virgin ...i think. I have a few tattoos, two of them very large. I am also somewhat of a thrill seeker. I have tried things from motorcycling to bungee jumping.I even have a rule that you should try everything once because you never know if you might like it.Exception, i think sex is something special and i would prefer to only have with the man i love. The problem is when i start to get serious with a guy they want sex of course and they assume im experienced.When i tell them im a virgin i get those i don't believe it looks. One guy even said that virgins wouldn't have tattoos, how stupid is that. My question, Is it so hard to believe a girl like me is a virgin just because i don't fit the pure, innocent, sweet as pie stereotype and what would you think if you met a girl like me would you believe it?

20090220022825AAUD7Yx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Partner/Husband Help Feel so stuck!?	I have been with my fella for nearly 9 years, we have 2 kids 6 and 3. I work full time and my partner is the stay at home dad. It worked out better that way coz i could earn more money. The problem is I get very little say what we spend our money on. When it come to booking a holiday it take me weeks and arguments a plenty to book one (and i'm talking about 1 week in a carvan at Haven once a year, we have never been abroad). He always says we can't afford it. I shop round for bargains all year, never buy expensive clothes, always accept hand me downs etc. He on the other hand drinks quite abit well about 4-8 cans every night, more at weekends and smokes. He won't eat normal food, just crisps, sandwiches and chinese from the takeaway, oh and pizza. He'll never try any of my foods I cook like lasagne (doesn like the mince!) The other thing is he never does much around the house, I mean he does take them to school, but when I'm on lates I do half of that and when on days i always pick them up from school, and other than that he does the clothes washing, and the pots. But he never takes the kids out, never does anything with them in the day, half term never does anything.       The time is coming soon when he'll be able to go to work, when the youngest starts nursery, but everytime i talk about it he gets right *rse on and then starts to ignore me. He can be very nasty at times and plays on his xbox alot of the time.       We don't drive and find it difficult to be able to afford to take the kids anywhere, I got some free cinema tickets the other week, but it still cost us ￡10 in travel and ￡5 on goodies, and i often feel guilty that i dont take them many places. I always get envious when I hear about other people taking their kids here and there or when i hear about other husbands doing DIY or taking their kids swimming, its just something we'd (or He) would never do.      I just think he doesn't like doing any family things and thats why its always like - we can't afford it when i want to go on holiday or someting or a day out - but yet theres always money for his beer xbox chinese etc.      I dont know what to do. I know some people might say give him a ultimatum, but how, he'll just say f off or give me the silence treatment, then what? If i said get out he'd just say no and stay put, so....? I can't just leave myself coz if i did id have to lose my job  to look after the kids which ive worked so hard to get where I am for the past 4 years. We have a joint bank account, but even if i took all my wages out he would just use the tax credit money and the child benefit money for his spends and i would end up paying for it anyways.      Oh what can I do?? Please someone advise me? Thanks for listening. xx

20090220054848AAT7ZjD	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should i do? Do you ever have to just leave a friendship?	Well my friend keeps breaking my trust, and a few days ago he did it twice, badly in one day, and i told him the night before that i wasn;t going to keep on taking his ****, i dont believe in just one chance but when is enough enough?        Anyways he screwed me over, mind you it was partially my fault, i was judgemental about someone, i real horrible girl who only has 3 words in her dictionary, all of them swear words, i told him quietly that i thougth she was a bit riff - raff ish and he went  told everyone, including her what i said, later that day one of the girls enemys got a group of friend to attack her in the street, which ended with one girl vommitiing blood, and a collapse i said to my friend that it didnt surprise me what happens and that it only proves that she is not the calibre of person i want something to do with. Well he took that to mean that i had said "they deserved it" and went and told these girls and their friends that i thought they deserved gettign bashed.       I'm not particularly worried about the girls, but my friend cant keep his mouth closed. And i brought it up with him seeking answers, and he said he was sick of having to apologise to me all the time and sick of having arguments, and that he didnt want to be friends, but today he acted like nothing had happened. What do i do?  He is sometimes a really good friend, and i dont wanna make excuses for him but maybe he was having a bad day, i still want him as a friend, but he wont talk about it.       Should i want him as one of my friends? I have no other friends that are close at all, and he can be good. but he is 100% decided not to be friends anymore, is that a good or bad thing? So confusing lol

20090220055920AAw7qTR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you know when your think/am falling out of love?	i've loved a boy for 4 years.    we have been going out for 2 years.   things are really changing in our relationship.   we dont talk as much, or see each other tha much.    ill call, he wont pick up.    ill text, never answers.    he told me he was in love with me & that he has deep feelings for me, and i feel the same but now the way things are going im just so sure he feels the same way?      idk if were falling OUT of love?
20090220055956AAjxR9W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have recently been flirting with a man i am very attracted to and i am confused?	we work together, in different departments.    A few weeks ago we started chatting online.    Very flirty conversations which i am enjoying.   Almost every night he contacts me online and we spend hours and hours chatting to each other.   He even contacts me when we have both been at work together all day.   I just found out that he has a girlfriend, which is not working out.   I am attracted to him and think he maybe attracted to me.   but i'm unsure as to what i should do.    Is he a player and just using me for fun, is he interested or is this just friendship?   At work i find him watching me, he makes a point of starting a conversation and treats me differently from other employees.   I'm just really confused right now and don't want to ruin the friendship by telling him how i feel.   Any advice or comments would be great.
20090220060425AAc6XSh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex- girlfriend thought i cheated??	ok my girlfriend broke up with me 9months ago quite suddenly out of the blue. we were very much in love and things were going well. i couldn't work out why, she just said she wasn't happy so i eventually accepted it as maybe just she wasnt as into me as i thought.      we stayed friends and kept in contact, quite randomly she actually lived with me for a month while she had no-where to live and look for a new flat. we continued to get on well but nothing happened.      she then moved out and we would occasionally contact....then suddenly she deleted me from her facebook friends. after a while she added then deleted. after adding again she put an angry note on my page which was directed quite blatantly at one of my friends.      then i get a text saying 'you cheated on me, i know it'. after a lot of probing i find out she thought i cheated on her last year. what actually happened was my cousin was getting married and had the stag do in sweden. when the best man was organising the nite out i told him i had an old friend who used to live in london who was swedish who would know the best places to go. so i got back in contact with her to get details. after that she put msgs on my page such as 'miss u!!' and 'would be good to see you' as she left london bout 4 yrs ago and we were catching up.      anyway my ex thought i went to sweden on the do, metup with this girl and cheated despite the fact i told her she doesn't even live in sweden anymore, plus there was no way i would do anything like that to her. she is convinced      anyway a few weeks ago her dad fell ill and we were talking, she texted me she misses me and wished what we had was the best and she wished it never finished when it did.      A few days ago she has now texted me saying she is sorry for all the hurtful things she said to me (she called me everything under the sun at the time) saying shes thought about it and feels really bad.      I havent replied to her yet......what should I do??

20090220061741AArZgSM	Family & Relationships;Family	Would you threaten to kick your adult daughter out of the house just because she shaved her head?	For various reasons, the main one being convenience, I decided to shave my head.  I gave my grandparents (adoptive parents) about two weeks' warning about it, so they had plenty of time to express their opinions on the matter.  My grandpa said I should think long and hard about it before doing it and nothing more, and my grandma repeatedly made it clear that her main concern was that I would never find a job, being a bald woman by choice and tried telling me that the Bible says a woman's hair is her glory, etc.  Last night, my brother brought over the clippers and razor to do the deed, and I even told my grandparents beforehand that we were getting ready to do it.  My brother and I were laughing about it, having a great time as the hair fell off.  It wasn't until he had chopped most of my hair off in the back bathroom that I heard my grandma yelling, screaming, crying and carrying on to everyone but me about how I should have enough respect for them to wait until I'm out of the house.  This is when both my grandparents came stomping back to the bathroom after it's too late, and my grandpa says, "You might be looking for another place to live" and swore he had told me this long ago when I first brought it up when, in fact, he hadn't.  I cried because, had I known there was any chance I would be kicked out over something so stupid, I would have waited.  So, just to make sure I'm not the crazy one here, is there anyone out there who would threaten to kick their daughter out of the house simply because she shaved her head?      NOTE: I'm 19 years old, and as long as I don't vandalize their property, damage their health, play my music too loudly, blatantly disrespect them, do my part to help out around the house, etc., I believe it's my right as an adult to do whatever I want, especially with my own body.  They're hardcore Southern Baptists, who probably think my shaving my head is a sign I'm either insane or lesbian.  I'm not Christian (which they don't know, or else they would stop quoting the Bible like it's going to change my mind about everything I want to do that they disagree with), but I do respect their beliefs as long as they don't try to shove them down my throat or judge me based off of them.

He has been married and divorced 3 times with no kids and I  am going through a divorce and have two kids. I will always love him but cant forget all the things that tore us apart. He says he has and always will love me he just did not want us to be one of "THOSE" couple that get married right out of school and end up hating each other. He said he knew he would cheat on me and that we were to young at the time. He says that after all this time he thinks of me everyday and we must have really had something Special if 14 years and many people have gone by and we still love each other.

However, I don't know if all girls, or at least high school girls,   are like this but she changes the person that she likes   very quickly and easily.      For a while she was into me, then she changed it to one   of my best friends. then came back to me, then changed to   my friends. Then changed back to me, then changed again.      Right now she's liking this guy, and is being pretty blunt about it.   I used to act all friendly to her, and cheered her up when she   cried when the guy didn't her like her back, I used to like her back, but now I'm just plain sick and tired of this game.   I'm almost at a point where I just want to give up on her completely.

He's receiving unemployment because he doesn't have a job but I feel like he's not even looking for one, well I know he isn't. It's like he's been so spoiled by his parents he knows he can just lay around. And he constantly says "Well I'm a kid" and I reply "You not really a kid anymore"... It's like taking care of a little brother.. What do I say to motivate him to want to do something?

Guys I was wondering if I should tell my guy friend of one year tonight that I have liked him from the beginning & I know that he likes me. He said that he would date me but isn't over his ex g/f's cheating on him. They broke up last August so he probably should be over her by now. See I'm kinda afraid to do this b/c he has told me he likes me as a friend but before he would always ignore my calls/texts for no reason. Then all of a sudden he had this dream about me & is wanting to hangout alot more. He is answering my texts faster & wanting to hangout when before he was always busy. What should I say to him? Should I tell him that I still like him or what? Thanks! :)

20090220071536AA54h93	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Help!! Been married for a couple of months and thinking of divorce already?	The problem is my husband I agreed to live with his parents for a short while and then to move to our own place. Now the time has come he is dragging his feet and every time I bring up the topic he finds something to stop talking to me about when really he should be focusing on the house move.  i've asked him outright whether he actually wants to move at all and he has said 'yes', so i'm at a loss here as without any constructive action/feedback from him how can i move forward to look for a place to live.  I have considered just getting a place anyway but I know that he would use that as an excuse, ie: you found it yourself, I had no input, i'm not moving' But he's not trying to help at all.  His parents have both been so rude to me and made me feel like a 2nd class citizen the whole time I have lived with them, I've done everything I can to get them to stop so the only way is to move. Any insight would be greatly appreciated

20090220071127AAIgsYG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is this girl acting like this?	Ok theres this shy girl who really doesnt talk to a lot of people but she has a few friends. She started talking and I can tell she really likes me by the nonverbal communications and how I catch her stairing at me, now I just found out she has a boyfriend back at home and I think they seem really close. When we talk she only mentioned him once. Now I told her that I got the feeling that she liked me but I knew she had a boyfriend and everything and she acted so differently to me after that it was actually really awkward. So we agreed on being friends but she still avoids me. She stoped sitting next to me in class and 3 days later i got a text saying she needed a while, i guess before she would sit next to me again, so my question is will she end up sitting next to me and talking with me again and why is she acting like this if were goin be friends?

20090220071546AAjk8no	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I never found the girl I like, should I get out from my country?	99% of girls in my school are all cold, mean, highly secure or shy, they don't talk to me, So, I don't know what kind of girls they are, besides, I like girls who don't are not like that,I like girls who are very open and not scared to men. I am not sure, maybe, I don't talk to them because they don't talk to me, they may feel the same things as me. They dont talk so, I cant try to like them who they are. Not just that, when I see them,they are very shallow, they have boyfriends who I hate, guys who are jerks, shallow, wear too expensive clothes. I don't even like their looks and characteristics at all,do u think I should get out from my country and go to seek women in other country?
