20090307151220AAArn9Z	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Is there a "liberal" here who can tell us EXACTLY what Dems mean when they babble on about "assault weapons"?	Just curious to know if any of you understand the standard Dem sleight of hand on this issue. Ten points to the first "liberal" that actually KNOWS what DiFi, Jumpin' Johnnie Conyers, Little Chuckie Schumer, et al. mean (SPECIFICALLY) when they toss off the term "assault weapons".      The reason I ask is that the subject has once again reared its ugly head even though every top Dem in the party knows it's the kiss of death to get into the whole gun thing because they ALWAYS LOSE - with the public, in court, every which way but loose.  (Just ask Algae the Green Guy which was the most important reason why he lost in 2000. No, kiddies, it was NOT The Evil Supreme Court, Kathleen Harris, Jeb Bush, et al. - it was, according the The Green Guy himself, his position on firearms ownership by American citizens (along, of course, with his woeful lack of understanding of the Second Amendment. (Well, whattaya expect from a lawyer, anyway?)))      So, lefties, before you're once again manipulated to the detriment of your party, I suggest you understand how your elected betters are jerking you around when it comes to the oh-so important issue of "assault weapons". You might start by understanding exactly what those elected betters of yours mean when they utter the phrase. Just a thought - you DO wish to be informed citizens, don't you? I was SURE of it!      And, puhleeezzzeee, those of you who are inclined to prattle on about something other than the question at hand, grow up and move on to a question to which you have the faintest idea of the answer. This question requires you to have specific knowledge (which I'm inviting you to share with your fellow lefties) or to do a little work(!) and find that specific knowledge for the purpose of enlightening your own kind. You CAN do that, can't you?
20090307151138AAhKHnD	Politics & Government;Politics	A question about embryonc  stem cell research?	This is not a question about the pros/cons or rights/wrongs of stem cell research.       Regardless of personal feelings on the subject, the idea of embryonic stem cell research has a lot of ethical and controversial issues.  There have been research done and published regarding ways to obtain stem cells for study that do not come from embryos.  It seems logical to me that obtaining non-embryonic stem cells would erase the controversy and allow scientific research to continue.        For those who support embryonic stem cell research: if using stem cells from other sources (not embryos) is possible, why is it necessary to continue using embryos, especially since it carries such controversial baggage?       For those against embryonic stem cell research: Would you support stem cell research if the cells were not obtained from embryos?        It just seems to me that it would make more sense all around if we utilized the technology to obtain stem cells in a way that wasn't such an ethical and controversial nightmare.  I'm sure the research would go farther and faster if the public was behind it, instead of it being such a dividing factor.

20090307151538AA4Lzvc	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Need community property law & divorce settlement clarification?	This question applies to interpretation of the Wisconsin community property laws with regards to marriage/ divorce:      If one party (woman) has a house prior to getting married, and the mortgage isn't completely paid off yet, when she gets married then my understanding is the house would be her separate property.       However, since she doesn’t own the property outright yet and still has to make payments on the mortgage - would the husband then be able to claim the house was community property in the event of a divorce down the road?      For ex purposes, lets say the wife still had 15 years left on the mortgage, she made all the payments herself (though I'm not sure if that matters since her income would be apparently half his too) including principle, interest, insurance, repairs etc. And they got divorced 10 years after getting married and raising 3 children in the house.       Saying it another way, chronologically - say she buys the house in 1990, makes payments for 5 years while her boyfriend (future husband) lives with her rent free all that time. In 1995 they get married with this house as their primary residence. She continues making payments with income earned from HER job. The husband has a few low paying jobs, but stays home when they have their first child to be the caretaker since the wifes job pays more. In 2005 the wife files for a divorce when she finds out the husband has been cheating on her. At that point she would have been paying the mortgage for fifteen years, ten of which while married. If the husband were say 40 years old at this point, being the primary caretaker for their 3 children - would he have any rights to the house, spousal support or be able to receive alimony? Is there a certain number of years they would have to be together for alimony, or how does the judge look at making that determination?      How would a court look at that situation if the husband is trying to get partial ownership of the house as compensation for being a stay at home dad (and say he wasn't a professional - had no degree, was working at a gas station and would've rather stayed at home with the kids than make $6 an hour)?  Would it matter that they were already in a relationship and living together when she originally bought the house, though not yet married?

If you think there will be, when do you think? Also, don't forget a Jew won the most votes for VP in 2000, and the ticket with the most votes nationwide wins 94% of the time.
20090505174415AA2v8mi	Politics & Government;Politics	What historical figure has mirrored Obama?	What figure in history does Obama closely represent?      1. He came into power with clever slogans, good speeches, and promised to make the rich pay.       2. His father left his mother at a young age.       3. He is highly racist and blames that race for a myriad of problems.       4. He took over the automobile industry and wants to create an economical, environmentally friendly car for the people.       5. He used coercion to gain control of the banking sector and browbeat any CEO who dared stand up to him.       6. He plans on taking care of all the people by controlling what industries can produce.       7. He is highly agitated at the previous administration and will consolidate power by ridding himself of opponents all in the name of "justice".       8. His handlers have full control of the media and he wields their influence at his will.       9. He plans on silencing dissenting viewpoints through regulation, not legislation.       10. He has labeled those in the opposition as domestic terrorists.       11. He fancies himself as a leader of the world.       12. His first action in power was massive public works projects.       13. He was a strong advocate of unions and insured employees wielded great control over their employers.       14. He used the bully pulpit with ruthless abandon all in the name of the people.

I have just found out that there IS no will from a possible will. I am fairly sure that the total of the estate (with his wife, my step mother) is worth well over $200, 000 the amount she can claim. The rest would be split 3 ways 1/3 to her and the other 2/3 to my sibling and myself. I am curious HOW I can go about finding out the value of the assets before I would go to court. Hire a lawyer? Can they do these look ups? Hire a private investigator? My father was an alcoholic that abused our family since I can remember and when I was 18 and I left home never had any contact with me except a few odd phone calls and visits. I am wondering how long this process could take as well if anyone has been through this before. Thank you for your time. We live in Ontario Canada.

I went to Costco yesteday to pick up a prescription and handed the pharmacy tech a $100 bill and she handed to I guess a supervisior that was outside of the pharmacy area,      this lady and guy comes back and ask me if there is any other form of payment that I can use to pay for my prescription and I told them yes and they said that they $100 bill was counterfeit and that they needed to keep it to turn it in to some place,      Well I ask if I can have it back and they said no, which I have no problem with but I wanted to see what was counterfeit about it and so I said that anyone can claim that the money could be counterfeit and keep it so I wanted to see for my self if it was counterfeit, and they agree but what annoyed me was they kept on holding the money like I was going to run with it,      Anyway They show me something with the coloring and the strip and picture but the way their were holding it I did not see it real well but I beleive it was counterfeit,      My problem is that since I am the one going to be out $100 I should be able to examine the money and second they should have never taken the money out of my sight.      Like i said I am not questioning the money being good or not but for a person like me who did not have any idea that I was passing counterfeit money or a person who is basically out $100 I think they should have been a little more compassionate for me wanting to see why I am going to be out the money,      I realize their are people who purposely print or manipulate bills and pass them but I was embarrassed about the situation and angry.      just getting people thoughts here and seeing if I am making a mountain over a hill.

An MP has told the House of Commons that Scots are "hurt" by the suggestion in shops across the UK that there is "something wrong" with their banknotes.      David Mundell was introducing a bill which would ensure Scots banknotes had to be accepted south of the border.      He said people in his Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale constituency wanted their money to be "accepted and not challenged".      As time ran out on the debate at 1430 GMT, Mr Mundell complained about the minister "talking out" his bill.         Were they right to use such an underhand way to block something that's been wanted north of the border for as long as independence?      Is this why nothing real ever gets done?

After all, there are maybe fewer main thoroughfares in a city than there are separate radio frequencies.  So does Durbin's logic extend to parades?  who about speeched in the public square?  Only one person at a time can be in that spot, and there are probably fewer "time slots" in a day at a major meeting place than there are radio frequencies.      What about bumper stickers on cars?  The streets are public property, and only a finite number of cars can be on it at once - again, probably fewer than the number of different radio frequencies available on the AM and FM bands.      What are the limits of Durbin's logic?      Thanks.

"Some of my partners weren't happy with that, Barack sitting there with his keyboard on his lap and his feet up on the desk writing the book."

For those of you without the benefit of direct experience, profit-oriented-private-enterprise healthcare is the healthcare system in which a private enterprise with a profit motive determines the care and treatment of the patient, ‘haggling’ with doctors over diagnoses and treatment, and weighing profit and loss against the value of the patient’s life, which quite frequently results in death from routinely curable maladies untreated (at an estimated current annual average rate of over 10,000). The first socially conditioned thought-terminating cliché most Americans recite is, “I don’t want the government assigning my doctor!” to which I always respond, “Right! -because private enterprise assigning your doctor, haggling down your treatment, or prohibiting treatment altogether, and subsequent death of routinely curable malady untreated is philosophically so much more palatable!” Believe it or not, that argument by all appearance never changes the mind of the average American. Not that I expect it will ever aid me in any argument with any American, but for my own entertainment value, please express your overall approval or disapproval of socialized healthcare and perhaps address one or both of these popular superstitions:      (1) Under socialized healthcare, the government ‘assigns’ doctors, and meddles in diagnosis and treatment.      (2) Under socialized healthcare, service is inefficient and quality is deficient.      Please help an ignorant ugly American overcome the mass communications information blackout with honest responses from average real people.

The cars, vacations, houses, and the entire coastline littered with yachts and mansions. And it isn't just debt, $250,000 a year wouldn't even cover the minimum payments on this rampant lifestyle. EXPLAIN please! I know that $100,000 is a good wage, but it doesn't touch the common lifestyle I see. Where is all of this money coming from?      These "vicitms" were just "teachers" and other everyman people, but with $4 million tucked away.  ARE WE WORKING STIFFS IDIOTS?

20090307104914AAc2YDP	Politics & Government;Politics	What principles do you advocate for government?	THE CREED OF FREEDOM      INTRINSIC NATURE OF RIGHTS        I believe that only individuals have rights, not the collective group; that these rights are intrinsic to each individual, not granted by the state; for if the state has the power to grant them, it also has the power to deny them, and that is incompatible with personal liberty.        I believe that a just government derives its power solely from the governed. Therefore, the state must never presume to do anything beyond what individual citizens also have the right to do. Otherwise, the state is a power unto itself and becomes the master instead of the servant of society.      SUPREMACY OF THE INDIVIDUAL        I believe that one of the greatest threats to freedom is to allow any group, no matter its numeric superiority, to deny the rights of the minority; and that one of the primary functions of just government is to protect each individual from the greed and passion of the majority.      FREEDOM OF CHOICE        I believe that desirable social and economic objectives are better achieved by voluntary action than by coercion of law. I believe that social tranquility and brotherhood are better achieved by tolerance, persuasion, and the power of good example than by coercion of law. I believe that those in need are better served by charity, which is the giving of one's own money, than by welfare, which is the giving of other people's money through coercion of law.      EQUALITY UNDER LAW        I believe that all citizens should be equal under law, regardless of their national origin, race, religion, gender, education, economic status, life style, or political opinion. Likewise, no class should be given preferential treatment, regardless of the merit or popularity of its cause. To favor one class over another is not equality under law.      PROPER ROLE OF GOVERNMENT        I believe that the proper role of government is negative, not positive; defensive, not aggressive. It is to protect, not to provide; for if the state is granted the power to provide for some, it must also be able to take from others, and once that power is granted, there are those who will seek it for their advantage. It always leads to legalized plunder and loss of freedom. If government is powerful enough to give us everything we want, it is also powerful enough to take from us everything we have. Therefore, the proper function of government is to protect the lives, liberty, and property of its citizens; nothing more. That government is best which governs least.

20090307112314AAgJz0f	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	38 Special Suggestions?	I am a security guard. My employer wants me to become an armed security guard. My pistol permit is being processed. The boss sent me to the range with five armed guards who are supposedly experienced. The boss wants us to carry a 38 Special revolver with 4" barrel, because it is the "classic" security guard's pistol and has lower liability costs than an automatic or more powerful pistol.   Three have the $200 Armscor M-200 because "that's what the company pays for". One had a Rossi 851 and kept the $200 as a bonus. The 5th one has a used S&W Mod. 10 in very nice shape, about 5 years old, he paid $500 for it. It can handle the +P rounds, the others probably can't.   All of these guys shoot well.They shot some "B-29" targets at 50' and "B-34" rargets at 75'. They could put 6 rounds into the "X" ring in about 10 seconds.   They let me try the larger "B-34" at only 50' because I've never shot anything other than a pellet gun or 22 rifle. In about 20 seconds, I could put 2 rounds in the "9" ring and the rest in the 7 or 8 ring. I still need a LOT of training, but I never had a total "miss" and I got two in ring between "X" and 9. Both of those shots were actually with the Rossi. I did best with the Rossi, but being so green, that may be more luck... They suggest I practice with this in my basement at home...  http://www.crosman.com/airguns/pistols/3...  It is a similar weight, but a little longer.   Any advice is appreciated.
20090307114419AAEvZ4k	Politics & Government;Politics	How can anyone think Ted Kennedy is a good person after reading this?	1.  He was caught cheating at Harvard when he attended it.  He was expelled twice... once for cheating on a test, and once for paying a classmate to cheat for him.    2.  While expelled, Kennedy enlisted in the Army, but mistakenly signed up for four years instead of two.  Oops, the man can't count to four.  His father, Joseph P. Kennedy, former U.S. Ambassador to England (a step up from bootlegging liquor into the U.S. from Canada during prohibition), pulled the necessary strings to have his enlistment shortened to two years, and to ensure that he served in Europe, not Korea, where a war was raging.  No preferential treatment for him like he charged George W. Bush with receiving.               3.  Kennedy was assigned to Paris , never advanced beyond the rank of Private, and returned to Harvard upon being discharged.  Imagine a person of his "education" NEVER advancing past the rank of Private.               4.  While attending law school at the University of Virginia , he was cited for reckless driving four times, including once when he was clocked driving 90 miles per hour in a residential neighborhood with his headlights off after dark, yet his Virginia driver's license was never revoked.  Coincidentally, he passed the bar exam in 1959... amazing!               5.  In 1964, he was seriously injured in a plane crash, and hospitalized for several months.  Test results done by the hospital at the time he was admitted had shown that he was legally intoxicated.  The results of those tests remained a "state secret" until in the 1980's when the report was unsealed.  Didn't hear about that from the unbiased media, did we?               6.  On July 19, 1969, Kennedy attended a party on Chappaquiddick Island in Massachusetts .  At about 11:00 PM, he borrowed his chauffeur's keys to his Oldsmobile limousine and offered to give a ride home to Mary Jo Kopechne, a campaign worker.  Leaving the island via an unlit bridge with no guard rail, Kennedy steered the car off the bridge, flipped it and went into the water.               7.  He swam to shore and walked back to the party, after passing several houses and a fire station.  Then two friends returned with him to the scene of the accident.  According to their later testimony, they told him what he already knew, that he was required by law to immediately report the accident to the authorities.  Instead, Kennedy made his way to his hotel, called his lawyer, and went to sleep.  Kennedy called the police the next morning, and by then the wreck had already been discovered.  Before dying, Kopechne had scratched at the upholstered floor above her head in the upside-down car.  The Kennedy family began "calling in favors", ensuring that any inquiry would be contained.  Her corpse was whisked out-of-state to her family before an autopsy could be conducted.  Furtther details are uncertain, but after the accident Kennedy said he repeatedly dove under the water trying to rescue Kopechne, and he didn't call police because he was in a state of shock.  It is widely assumed that Kennedy was drunk, and he held off calling police in hopes that his family could fix the problem overnight.  Since the accident, Kennedy's "political enemies" have referred to him as the distinguished "Senator from Chappaquiddick"..  He pled guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a suspended sentence of two months.  Kopechne's family received a small payout from the Kennedy's insurance policy and never sued.  There was later an effort to have her body exhumed and autopsied, but her family successfully fought against this in court, and  Kennedy's family paid their attorney's bills... as a "token of friendship"?               8.  Kennedy has held his Senate seat for more than forty years,but considering his longevity, his accomplishments seem scant.  He authored or argued for legislation that ensured a variety of civil rights, increased the minimum wage in 1981, made access to health care easier for the indigent, funded Meals on Wheels for fixed-income seniors, and is widely held as the "standard-bearer for liberalism".  In his very first Senate role, he was the floor manager for the bill that turned U.S. immigration policy upside down and opened the floodgate for immigrants from third world countries.               9.  Since that time, he has been the prime instigator and author of every expansion of and increase in immigration, up to and including the latest attempt to grant amnesty to illegal aliens.  Not to mention the Pious grilling he gave the last two Supreme Court Nominees, as if he were the standard bearer for the nation in matters of right.                10.  He is known around Washington as a public drunk and loud, boisterous and very disrespectful to ladies.  JERK is a better description than "great American".

20090307115646AAQtSTA	Politics & Government;Politics	Is this another sign that Hussein Obama's trickle-up poverty plot is working?	MASSILON, Ohio  —  Evidence of the slumping economy is stacking up at an Ohio school which has nearly 700 applications for one open janitorial job.      Officials at Perry Local Schools near Canton in northeast Ohio say they've extended the deadline until Monday to accommodate the overwhelming response to the week-old posting.      The full-time position at Edison Junior High School pays $15 to $16 an hour plus benefits.      Superintendent John Richard says many applicants are laid-off workers with heart-wrenching stories about the tough economic times.      Forty-nine-year-old Donna Croston says she applied after losing jobs at two nearby factories that closed.      Croston says her chances of being hired amid the hundreds of applicants are slim, but she's hoping to get lucky.

20090307103900AANLHyP	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Falsely accused of Stealing A Laptop from Work!!! Help!!!?	I bought a computer off of Craigslist back in October. In Dec a friend and I pulled a prank on my roommate. Which he called the cops once he found out what we did. Unf. they charged us with Grand Larceny and conspiracy for Grand Larceny. I got stuck in jail for 6 weeks, and my friend got off of everything.      While I was in jail there where a few witnesses saying my roommate was out for revenge on me and wanted me locked up for 20 years. While I was in jail 3 weeks later my roommate returned 2 IPODS from where we worked at saying he found them underneath my bed. Where we work at you get money back if you report a theft. He had full access to the Ipod area.       Then the police called my best friend who took my computer and ipod saying that they needed it. So he mailed it out to them. It matched that it was a stolen laptop from where we worked at. But the thing is they are saying that I stole this laptop in November, when I bought it on Craigslist in October. All in all since it matches a stolen laptop from where I work at they are going to arrest me sometime soon.       Any idea on whats going to happen? I didn't know the laptop was stolen, cause if I did I would of returned it. I have a roommate who's out to get me locked up for a silly stupid prank and had full access to my room and everything at work? I found the email that I sent the person in October to buy the laptop.

I lived in a house on my ex-roommates grandparents property, under no lease. I informed her I was planning on moving, and within 2 weeks, I was. She then told me I couldn't get anything out of the house until rent was paid, it wasn't due for a week. I told her I was going to continue to stay there, I would pay it. She told me I wasn't allowed to stay there anymore. So tons of conflict went down with her mom threatening me (her mom doesnt live there) and what not, so crying, I wrote a check. My dad then told me I was under no liability before it was month to month, so i canceled the check. Now she saying i stole $400 worth of stuff from the house even though they watched EVERYTHING i took out, and also say i owe the rent. everyone i've talked to said that I dont owe it because I gave her plenty of warning and moved out a week before rent was even due for the next month. Can I be wrongfully taken to court for the rent money, and the "$400 worth of stuff" even though they have no proof because its false? They said something about theft charges, even though i didnt take anything?

From 2005 - 2007 I was moving intrastate but always filed my taxes in a timely manner. In March of 2007 I learned that a Notice of Deficiency was mailed to me in June 2006. It was mailed to a NJ address (Im in Missouri) and during a period when I was homeless (MAY 2006-JUNE 2006).      I filed petition with US tax court. The $ the IRS is claiming I owe is from an ARBITRATED AWARD settlement from suing a former employer for violation of Federal insurance law: COBRA. The money I won is what the IRS is claiming is taxable. IT WAS AN AWARD, NOT TAXABLE WAGES. It was not $ earned for OT work, pension, Workman's comp, wages, etc.      1.  They mailed Notice to wrong address & ironically when I experienced the only period of homelessness in my life. As evidence to JUdge, should I obtain receipt from the State Park I stayed in during that time?  And what would such a Motion to US Tax Court say?      Secondly, was the money I received through a NON_court awarded settlement taxable? And where is the source if yes?      THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR HELP.      Colleen O'Donnell

He is known by many of the police in the small town I live in. He continues to harass, call, and show up at her home making threats and verbally fighting with her, she's changed her number at least 5 times, moving isn't in the equation. He has a pattern of fighting with girlfriends until he can get the female to push or slap him then call the police and cries domestic violence getting her arrested, if this doesn't work he will puncture her car tires. Thank goodness my daughter was never arrested but her tires have been cut on two occasions. He has acted this way with at least two other women that I know of and continues to try to get my daughter to take him back. He is bi-polar and has bouts of depression. The problem with the restraining order is there are never any witnesses and it is her word against his. The police in town like him, and are unwilling to confront him. Him and his brother once attacked a friend of my son in front of my home. When the police arrived they did nothing but say there were no witnesses and it could be mutual combativeness. What can be done to stop him. I'm worried for my daughters life. She is now understands why I'm so worried about her life. Who is to say one night he gets it into his head to run her off the road or do something to her car and she ends up in a horrible accident or worse dead. Thank you in advance for your help.

20090307123627AA3DjMG	Politics & Government;Politics	America, how do you feel about Brad Pitt having private meetings with our President?	Capitol Hill goes gaga over Brad Pitt      Pitt's superpowers are such that he and President Barack Obama pulled off an improbably secret meeting on the same topic earlier in the day, White House spokesman Thomas F. Vietor confirmed.   House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was not immune to his charms. Praising Pitt for his work to rebuild New Orleans' hurricane-ravaged 9th Ward, she even allowed that meeting him affords her "bragging rights to my children and my grandchildren — a real treat for me as well."      And during a closed meeting earlier, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid confided to Pitt that he was envious that his lieutenant, Majority Whip Dick Durbin, got to meet soccer star Mia Hamm a day earlier, according to one person who was present and spoke on condition of anonymity.   Well, Pitt replied, he'll bring along co-parent Angelina Jolie next time to help Reid make Durbin jealous, this person said.      Later, a Durbin aide sniffed: "Durbin's already met Angelina Jolie."      Inside with Reid, Pitt made an earnest case for nationalizing his "Make It Right" campaign, in partnership with Congress, according to a second knowledgeable aide who spoke on condition that he not be named because the meeting was private.      Afterward, this official said, Reid and Pitt posed for pictures, the senator cracking, "How will people tell us apart?"      Outside the door, grinning Capitol Police officers put up ropes to keep the hordes out of the path Pitt was expected to take toward his next meeting, with Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., in a building across the street.   Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the Judiciary Committee chairman who has appeared as himself in several "Batman" movies and even had a speaking line in "The Dark Knight," stumbled across the crowd gathered outside Reid's door.   Told who was inside, Leahy issued a giddy, "Gosh!" and kept walking.

20090227083515AAvcVjP	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Obama has been lying about just about everything since before he was sworn-in.?	During the campaign, he said he would have a "transparent" administration...Yeah, right...What's one of the first things he does? He says that he won't hire lobbyists for administrative posts, and virtually the next day he does exactly that, but then tells us that this is an "exception" and doesn't count. Obama has also told us that he'll post all new legislation online for 48 hours before final voting on it, then immediately broke that pledge (and has continued to). He has said that he will make it impossible for congressmen to slip in pork barrel projects into legislation, but the stimulus bill and now the omnibus bill are both loaded with pork. Obama said that he would make meetings where laws are written more open to the public, then he and the Dems held closed door meetings about the stimulus bill, where they wouldn't even let their Republican colleagues take part. On Tuesday night during his congressional address, Obama essentially defined "rich" as anyone making  $250,000 and up, saying those making less than that would be safe from a tax increase. Then yesterday, we find that the omnibus bill states that those making less than $209,000 would be safe from a tax increase...Which is it, Mr. President? In less than 2 days, the number has changed? The list goes on and on...All this man has done since taking the oath is lie and spout a lot of half-truths and misdirections. I'm at the point now, where I don't believe anything that comes out of his mouth...Obama could say the grass is green, and I'd go outside to look, just to make sure.

Shouldn't our "representatives" be proposing the legalization of all drugs, and the tax, regulation, sale of all natural plants just like alcohol... for instance you could go to the weed store and buy pot and magic mushrooms. Soft drugs which are less harmful than alcohol if you go do your homework.      For the hard drugs like cocaine and heroin I believe addiction should be treated as a medical condition instead of criminal condition and that addicts should be able to receive a sufficient supply from their doctors and also have real drug treatment availible for these people if they so desire.       Not only would the legalization of drugs be the humane and honest thing to do, it would also take the profits out of the hands of violent criminals, and open totally new avenues of business. The current policies do more harm than good and fund corruption and violent organized crime.

Look, his father is FROM Kenya and Obama was BORN in Hawaii, are Republicans that silly? Oh wait! I forgot they don't know much anyway on Yahoo! Answers except how to blame Obama for an economy that Bush messed up. It seems rather silly that they act as if the mid-00s didn't happened. Its Bush's fault that the gas prices were out of control, that people hate the US so much they'd throw a shoe at him, and that the U.S. is in the worst shape since The Great Depression. Obama spending is HELPING---I guess conservatives think if you spend $0, somehow it will make it better.

In 2004 i was arrested and charged for soliciting sex during a police sting operation in DC.Now the police report was a total lie,it says i had a conversation with the female decoy that i never had and it also says i was arrested after i entered a room which was not true i was arrested in my car.There were a couple of other guys arrested that same day for soliciting and other acts.   I case was not papered which made the judge drop the case,i filed a timely motion to seal my arrest record but it was denied because the prosecutor contended i was also charged with crack cocain possession. I have the paper work and i was never charged with crack cocaine possession neither have i ever seen what crack cocain looks like.I have never taken or dealt with any drogs in my life.   This whole issue has been a nightmare to me and i wonder if i could saw the DC police department for this.Their entire report was a lie and the even wrote a lie to the judge stating their refusal for a motion to seal was because i was also charged with crack cocain possession.   I am broke and i don't know where to start in regards to lawyers who will be willing to hear my case or even take it up.   I have all the paperwork from the charging documents to the false claim that i was charged with crack cocain possession.

I know there are lots of good law enforcement officers out there but DC police are truly horroible.   Please someone help me with some valueable information.

20090307133844AA5hPmn	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Alright, what just happened here? Legal advice PLZ!?	So I had a date to meet a buddy at a local Dennys-type restaurant here in town, I got there and, being a typical guy and having not eaten all day, I ordered right away, and after finishing my meal I realized he wasn't showing up. Problem was, he owed me the meal so I didn't have anything to pay with on me, it was all at home nearby. So I walked over to the manager and explained to him what happened, that I was a complete tool for putting myself in such a position, how sorry I was, and that in order to pay my $18 tab, I needed to run home and grab some money. I said I'd leave two pieces of I.D, or anything else, but I had to go home as I had nothing on me, not even a phone. I've only been in town one week, I didn't know anyone either then the one buddy, so yeah that was what happened, he said I couldn't leave, I said ok I understand but lol what am I supposed to do now? He said I could talk with Security, as the restaurant was attached to the mall, and sort a deal out with the Mall Cops. I said that sounded fair, so I sat and waited...       These three guys show up, speak to the manager, then wave me over. I kindly walked over and explained what happened and that I needed a way to get home to pay this $18 tab, or I could come back later or I needed to call a friend.       Next thing I know, the one "cop" pushes me against the wall, hand cuffs me, and tells me I'm under arrest for fraud? They grab me and drag me through the mall, completely humiliating me, and upstairs to throw me in a holding cell they have. Yeah, this actually happened.       The part that got me was I could hear them through the holding room, they were training this one cop. I was nothin' but a prop for their training, as they were tellin' him all the things he did wrong with me, clearly they were waitin' for something to happen so they could get this guy some action.      SO! After informing me I was under arrest for "fraud", handcuffing me and literally dragging me through the mall (I have bruises on my arm), and throwing me in this room, they call RCMP.      The woman shows up, comes in, I tell her everything, and she tells me I'm not under arrest, and she has no reason to believe I intended to do any crime, and that I had done nothing wrong. So I asked her how they had the right to TELL me I was under arrest, and treat me like they did. She told me they didn't, and I should call a lawyer.       She checks my background, sees that I've never so much as even had a speeding ticket, yet alone any criminal record, CLEAN. She makes them take me out of cuffs, she PAYS for my tab, and gives me $20 for a cab home and some beer, lol, WHAT!?      What the **** just happened? And what should I do?

Also I hear the Marines have a lot of guys that cross over from The Marine Corps to the Army... so, so much for the title - I guess it ain't all its cracked up to be in this day and age.      Also... does the Marines have handed down equipment from the Army?   I heard the Marines is the poorest branch in the military and has the worst housing, food, opportunities for advancement, and worst of all - they don't prepare you for a job after the military.      I think I am going with the Army... maybe Rangers.  I was going to be a Marine but then I found out what its like to actually be in the marine corps and it sounds like it sucks.

I was going to sign up for a Ranger contract but now i may change my mind and sign up for infantry instead.         "RIP contract will put you through basic and into airborne. Then you will be sent to the ranger battalion to become the ranger's cleaning ladies until you make it through RIP. If you make it you will have a seat at the ranger battalion (as an un-tabed member) only to wait a few years to make E-4 or above and get awarded a slot for ranger school. (There is a long line for that one as well)   Your best bet is to go to a Infantry unit get your experience and go to school through that unit. Then transferring to the ranger batt after you have been tabbed. Unless you like being a whipping boy for every ranger in the battalion." ~T N
20090307140027AAebHV7	Politics & Government;Military	Why does everyone like the Air Force and dislike the Marine Corps?	You hear so much about the Marine Corps is the best and the people in the Marines say their the best... or do they?  I heard alot of Marines on here say they don't like is there... especially women.            On this board, everyone praises the Air Force and pretty much agree that it is the best branch to be in.  They have the best housing, food, facilities... and treat the women the best.        Why does the Air Force have such a bad reputation when all the people from other services say its the best?      Why does the Marine Corps have the best reputation when so many of the people in the services tell you all the reasons why it is the worst branch to possibly join.      As far as I can tell from what the people in the actual military say...   The best to worst branches do not match their reputation.... why?      Best   1.. Air Force   2.. Navy   3.. Army   4.. Marine Corps      The Coast Guard seems to be good like the Air Force and Navy for men.  But for women the Coast guard is a bad choice like the Marine Corps.         I guess we should pick a job and a branch based on what the actual members in those branches say instead of their reputations.      I never knew the Air Force was so respected by its members of the military and the Marine Corps is just the opposite.  The commercials don't match the feedback from military service-men and women.

My question involves real estate located in the State of: TEXAS      The house my husband and I are renting was recently foreclosed. There are a lot of things that I feel hurt the Plaintiffs case, such as we have been in contact with 2 different law firms one of which told us we had 60 days to be out before we would be evicted also we never received a notice to vacate or any written notice. I believe they notified the homeowner but we were renting through a property management company and we were never informed verbally or written that we needed to move until we received a notice saying we needed to appear in court. It has been less than 30 days since the house was foreclosed and we received a Petition for Forcible Detainer and with it was a Military Service Affidavit stating that the named defendant is not active duty signed and notatrized but my husband IS active duty military. Will this error in their paperwork effect the case? I used to be a property manager for apartments in FL and AK and with our evictions if we had an error in our paperwork we had to re-file everything or the case would be thrown out. I do not know if this is the same in this situation or in Texas.       I sincerely appreciate any advice.

I think it's ridiculous because it's MY address as in my property, so why can I not have a say in whose mail comes here?  It's not like I'm asking them to change the address, I just want them to remove my address.  I don't like having all this personal information coming to my house.

20090307144014AAySNmB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	2 Years ago, I was arrested for shoplifting (minor) ..?	So, let me explain..      I was 15 years old. It was summer and extremely hot outside. My friend and I got caught stealing a bottle of water (stupid, I know.. I learned my lesson). Well, I was the one with the bag, so I was the that actually got caught. They gave me an hour to have an adult over 18 show up, but called the police 30 minutes into it. They said if the police were to get there before my aunt did, they'd let me go. Oh, they also took down my information and everything. Well, the police got there 5 minutes before my aunt did, but she managed to get there under an hour. Well, I was handcuffed and taken to to precinct where they took down my information and everything. I also got a fine which was already taken care of.       My question is..       In job applications, they ask if you have any criminal records.. Since I'm a minor, do I have to write down what happened? I understand some people don't hire people with a record, but many people are telling me i don't have to write it and that my record would be 'wiped clean' when i turned 16. Is that true? or should i still write it in a job application?             SORRY IF THIS WAS LONG! ANY ANSWERS WOULD BE HIGHLY APPRECIATED!

The bankruptcy is due to a mortgage I can no longer afford to a reduction in my income. I have exhausted all options on my mortgage so please no lectures. Sale,re financing, short sale, stimulus plan etc. I need to get a newer car to carry me through the next several years of bad credit. My credit has suffered badly due to the house. I need a co-signer and have one. My question is if i put cash down on the car before purchasing it will that be viewed as fraud because the car is in 2 names? Like giving someone else my cash before a bankruptcy.

She has been since Feb 3rd this year so over a month and will be at least until March 23rd, that's when her revocation hearing is. She is on probation for dealing cocaine. She is being charged with felony child abuse. When i spoke with her P.O. he said she would be in for awhile! Anyways my hubby and I were taking care of her dogs. The multiple drives a day were killing us financially. We lived 30 min each way away from her. Since she had no money to pay her bills I spoke with her landlord and took over her house so we could take care of her dogs. We put all of her stuff in storage under the assumption she is going to prison. Now we feel like well "what if" she gets out soon. Did we jump the gun? Should we go back to our apartment before its too late? Then what will I do with her dogs b/c I cant have them there? Please I need advice!!!

Thing is the first and middle initial of the name is not mine. The rest of the information, however is true. My qeustion is am I still legally obligated to handle this ticket, or since the name is not mine, am I off the hook? Did the cop just give me a joke ticket? By the way I live in CT, but the ticket was issued in NY.

After the sales person swiped my card on the register, I noticed he used a pen to roll it over the credit card and on top of a piece of paper. He did this in front of me and I signed it but didn't receive a copy of it. Why would he do this and should I be aware of my accounts ?         I have since changed accounts and that credit card number is no longer any good.

Both of their names are on the deed to the house. They are no longer together, but he will not get out of the house. he is violent towards her, but she has never called the police on him. She only threatens to do it. He hits her, throws things at her, and is an alcoholic. My 2 year old niece looked at me and said I hate you. I said what?? She said thats what daddy says to mommy. So I just know all of this violence happens in front of her. He is saying he will not allow her to get off the deed because he will not be stuck paying for it. What are her rights here? I know she has just let this stuff happen, but she is done letting him do this to her. All she wants is to either get him out of the house, and she will solely own it, or leave it all behind??

20090307155024AAw4nEu	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	I feel like I'm being ripped off by my last employer...?	I worked for a large corporation for four and a half years. Right before I quit, I realized I had not been paid for 17.33 hours of regular pay (not overtime) that I had put on my timesheet. I called my boss, and he told me that for consistency purposes, my annual salary is split up over 24 paychecks so that every check has 86.67 hours on it. So even if it is a short pay period, or a long one, I'm still getting 86.67 hours of pay. I told him, I am not a salary employee, I am an hourly, non-exempt employee, and if I worked 17.33 hours over the usual 86.67 hours, I should get paid for them. He told me to email my concerns to HR, which I did, and I got the same exact answer from them. I finally sent another email two weeks ago asking for an emailed and hard copy of my hiring package. I haven't heard back from HR, and nothing has come in the mail. I also asked for a copy of all my e-time entries for 2008, because I found out that after sending my timesheet to my boss, he had to input my hours in, and changed them from what I had given him. I'm pretty sure that's illegal. Does anyone have any advice for me on how to settle this? I feel like they are just procrastinating on sending my my hiring package, in the hopes that I'll let it go, because they know they are wrong. Don't they have to send me a copy of it within a certain amount of time? I'm so frustrated, but I want the money that they owe me!
