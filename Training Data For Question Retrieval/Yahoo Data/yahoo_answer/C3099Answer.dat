So it's hard to tell.  Maybe you could call ahead.
fVlVoJ2iaa	It is more expensive to ship from Hong Kong to the US than from within the US. It also depends on how large the item is. The larger (and heavier) the item, the more expensive it will be to ship. You will find that shipping anything internationally, even shipping something to/from Canada, can be quite expensive.    Also, shipping is a way to raise the "price" of the item without having to pay extra fees to eBay. Think about how much the item is ACTUALLY worth and see if the shipping PLUS bid price is reasonable. Of course, some people will raise the shipping just to make an extra buck, but this is not necessarily the case. If you don't want to pay that price, don't bid.

Su0O55W8aa	Yes, most employers will contact your previous employers in order to find out your work habits and personality skills.  Some people will say not to notify your current employer that you are leaving or plan to leave because they can fire you on the spot and replace you.  If you have had good work ethics at your current job then I would talk to your boss and explain your situation.  Tell them that you are needing to focus on school more than work and need more time to devote to it instead of work and that you plan to leave once you find another job that meets your needs.  Let them know that they may be receiving calls from potential employers so they aren't thrown off when they answer the call.  Don't forget to tell them that you will work a two week notice before leaving them and notify your potential employer that you will be working a 2 week notice before you can start.  This is a typical time frame in order to allow time to replace you.  If you get fired then there's nothing you can really do about it, you went about things the right way and it is them in the wrong!

You can imagine the diseases going around in that place.  A coworker of mine's friend caught an STD in her eye from a male dancer.    A nice art show or play would be much more stimulating.
hIqCpiXKaa	To be honest, I don't think there is a plus size store for gothic chicks. One of my suggestions would be to go to a normal department store and search around in there. You will find alot of the black edgy stuff there. Another awesome store is Torrid. Click http://community.torrid.com/torrid/custo... for your local store. They will have alot of the black jackets and pants. Another tip if you want the black pants with the chains look for guy pants. If you are looking for the hard core goth your going to have to go to the internet. While I know this is always a scary though I found some places with some kick ... goth clothing. All of which can be returned for a full refund within 30 days. Check the sources box. Best of Luck!|`|fFqzD3aMaa	That's what hot topic was made for|`|a95614042febddd2890b0013dde6747caa	i think torrid might have some of what you are looking for.  if you can't find it there, i have had some luck just putting gothic plus size into yahoo or google search.

f6ZFjatlaa	You can go to their website once you are laid off and fill out the form. Depending on your salary, they will determine how much you will get. I think the cap though is like $400 a week! You will have to show that you are actively looking for a job. You just have to send like 3 jobs that you sent your resume to each week.

NfSLXHU3aa	It costs less to buy a house, property, etc than in Los Angeles, Riverside, or Orange Counties.    In 1996, my house rent was $550 in San Bernardino County.    My sister-in-law's rental was $1500 in Los Angeles County.    (both 3 bed 2ba houses)    My 3 cousins shared a 12 x 12 bedroom near the city of San Francisco and paid $1000 plus utilities.|`|o36YrSWRaa	I guess this only applies to the city of San Bernardino but here are my answers    Good things:   McDonalds museum on E street.  $2 beer Tuesdays at the Rustic Inn  Beautiful mountains  Cal State SB  Paco's Tacos    Bad things:  Murder  Rape  Arson  Gangs  Homelessness   Lack of culture  Crazy (I mean really insane) winds    There are nice parts of the county though. Redlands is nicer and has some really cool historic buildings. The Redlands Symphony is actually pretty good too.
4b05658f9b80d400cfc53e2ea5ecf209aa	You could try a business class hotel (Hilton Homewood Suites, Marriott Residence Inn, etc.).  Call one up and talk directly to their sales manager.  If you are at all flexible on your dates they may have a weekend that is wide open because these hotels tend to fill up more during the week than on the weekend.  Stick to places outside of Manhattan, though......if at all possible.    Other possibilities are a church, an American Legion or some sort of fellowship hall.    Good luck and have fun!|`|2G8lOPN8aa	Why not just a church hall or something like that?    Most hotels or other venues that serve food will not let you bring in your own food.  Does it have to be NY proper?    Because 50 people would be $10 a head if you did a nice brunch somewhere... many hotels will give you space if you confirm x number of guests at so much a head... depending on what you planned to spend on the food that you make to bring in...you might be able to have a nice catered brunch at a nice hotel for under $15-20 a head...or at a restaurant that has a private function room... places are hurting for business in these tough economic times...so see what they are quoting and then negotiate.

5cd65fca68a8e4880afd3f1b31db04a9aa	Look in the phone book for a legal aid clinic.  They should be able to provide legal services on a sliding scale according to your income.  Depending on the employer's reasoning for the termination, you may be able to enlist the aid of the state or federal Labor Board.  Keep in mind that Texas is a right to work state.  This means that while employees do have rights, employers can hire and fire at will and you will have a higher burden of proof to succeed in a lawsuit.  Unless the employer has done something particularly egregious, something you can easily and publicly document, you need to sit down and decide if you really want to spend your resources--time, money and energy--toward getting your old job back or some sort of settlement.  (Even if you do win a monetary settlement, there is no law forcing the employer to make him or her to pay promptly.  The employer could use the court system to fight the settlement.  The whole process can easily take 3-5 years.)  Too, a lawsuit is public information.  Future employers may not want to hire you if you have a reputation for suing employers.  It's not a fair system, but do talk to a lawyer about your particular circumstances.  Only then can you make an informed decision.|`|f4123c15d4eaad7426771d6679b1eadcaa	If you need an affordable way to get access to your LEGAL RIGHTS, please check out the site below and click on Family Legal Service Plans and watch the movie clip.

82359ab5eb2bec5d95da9132c032f006aa	Yes, you have to come up with a pretty good excuse and send it to them in writing, in order for them to stop.  Stay on top of the situation and demand to speak with a manager and get their name and document every time you call...if you know what you're talking about when you call the next time, the transactions will stop as long as you have fulfilled your contract, or have a good reason to get out of it.|`|VrjF986Aaa	my boyfriend had that problem when he joined LA Fitness in toms river, nj. he had to submit a form and keep calling and pestering them, even calling the corporate hq just to get them to cancel it and stop drawing money out of his account.|`|TZAWLsMOaa	is it planet fitness? lol|`|aBziQhx2aa	You need to fill something out at your bank telling them that the fitness club is no longer authorized to take money from your account. Make sure you've formally cancelled your membership with the club first.|`|hy3f7XqDaa	yes! 24 FITNESS does that its so annoying.  they were charging me a fee for not going?  ridiculous. so i cancelled.|`|xEJYJHECaa	More than likely you signed a contract saying that you allowed them to do so and in return the gym offered you a better rate compared to someone who pays per visit.  This means you don't just get to stop paying when you decide to stop going like you stated.  Usually you have to finish out the term of the contract or give them 30 days (some times more) written notice that you want to cancel.  Many people aren't responsible with accounts like this in getting them closed down correctly which gives the advantage to the gym.
ZWlMbne8aa	It depends on what you're looking for.    - I like Fred Meyer because it's usually the most conveniently located with numerous locations and has a good selection.  Most of the stores have clothing, hardware, furniture, etc. for "One Stop Shopping".    - Safeway is probably the other most common supermarket (but I'm not a fan).  - I prefer New Seasons for the "best place" in terms of quality food.  It is a small, local chain started by disillusioned former Wild Oats/Whole Foods employees.  It's organic/natural food are a little spendier than an average supermarket, but more reasonable than Whole Foods.   - Zupans is another local gourmet chain.    - QFC, Albertsons, Whole Foods also have a few stores.  - WinCo and Food4Less are the cheap, no frills, warehouse stores on the outskirts.    - Costco is the Blue state version of Sam's Club  - Portlanders have successfully kept WalMart out of town except for one location.|`|Nv9oTxLzaa	The employees are wonderful at NewSeasons.  Everyone is extremely nice and helpful.  If you're looking for a store that offers organic and locally grown options, then you want to head to New Seasons.  As a vegan, I love all their soy choices and random food you'd find nowhere else.  Trader Joe's also has a lot of the local/organic stuff, but offers fewer options than New Seasons.    WinCo is great if you want cheap.  You're not gonna find a lot of the options you would at New Seasons, but it costs a whole lot less.  I usually buy my fruits & veggies here.    If you're buying for more than one, getting a Costco membership might be worth it.  All of their bulk prices aren't great, but a lot of them are.    The above poster mentioned Freddies, Safeway, and Albertsons (I think).  Though convenient, the prices and options just aren't that great.    One more thing you may want to check out is one of the local food co-ops.  You can find more information at there website, which can be found here: http://www.peoples.coop/
COFPXYvZaa	if you're looking for "walmart-like" stores, your best option is fred meyer, popular with the locals. they have most things that walmart would have, as well as produce and food and lots of other things. besides that, we also have safeway, albertsons, QFC (generally geocery stores) and then the obvious target and walmarts.|`|83vhCGW1aa	It's hard enough moving to a new place, but don't worry, you're going to a great city.  Let me see what I can do to help.  First off, there is a wallmart in the city, at 4200 Se 82nd Ave.  But since your new to the city, theres also alot to do in town. There are tons of museums, galleries, bars, nightclubs, etc.  Also, if you're in the metro area, there's Clear internet http://www.clear.com/?utm_source=bc . Its wireless broadband that works anywhere in the metro area, and its not too expensive either.

Oye, ahora que me acuerdo, ?has mirado que las orejas sean aerodinmicas? No es aconsejable correr en "carretera", pero lo mismo se eternizan un poco los viajes en paquidermo.   Definitivamente, me das muuuucha envidia.   Me comprar un elefante yo tambin y la prxima vez que me cruce con el conductor estpido del otro da le pedir a mi nueva adquisicin que le sople un poco con la trompa, que va a resultar ser de lo ms polivalente... ;-)  Abrazos y saluditos.|`|vkg65VWTaa	?Qu raza es tu elefante, primero?|`|SVXvKsTYaa	?Le quitastes la L de principiante?  ?es su andar majestuoso e insinuante?  ?Pusistes los perniles antideslizantes?  ?Le surtes de mani en cantidades ingentes?  ?Y sus cagad-s son espesas, grandiosas y pestilentes?  Entonces, amigo, no hace faltan intermitentes  puede mover su trompa graciosamente  Solo un favor te pido  que si me ves pasar por detras  ruegale, por dios,   que no se ponga a cagar|`|34d0fb8d66f7cdfd34740a811ddc9d03aa	le amarras un hilo bieeeen largo y con eso hasta de la cama lo puedes manejar    asi manejo mi vaca|`|X8c3nawjaa	Joo Mani, t tienes un pastn! Mira que tunnear al elefante y contratar un seguro y an tener pasta para ponerle intermitentes...    Pero vamos, con la trompa basta, pero has de comprar una bombilla para ponerle en la punta para circular de noche, uuuh.    Salut!|`|HazsEWh7aa	Anda que te ha dado fuerte con los elefantes.... te espero en el cemententerio con ellos, te reconocer por tu pelo. Saludos titi.|`|f767a280c6d1c1443f4a3bccec4f3ed3aa	Creo que con la trompa basta y sobra, jajajajaja!|`|cW8nWmQjaa	Con la trompa es suficiente.  saludos|`|vaFiigqhaa	jejejejeejeje  Mejor le pones unos intermitentes en las orejas  jejejejejeje  Te ha dado con el elefantito, cuando le tengas puesto a punto nos invitaras a dar una vuelta, verdad?  Un abrazo|`|vr7bUosWaa	JAJAJAJAJA
IPdsK0kvaa	On a le droit de devenir riche. En revanche, souvent les nouveaux riches ont tendance  afficher leur fric de fa?on ostentatoire et ?a, c'est pas classe.  |`|xvlmnTxZaa	Il ne faut pas se moquer des riches,on sait jamais comment on peut devenir..|`|ySkrTfHOaa	Qui a toujours eu des anciens riches(dans le sens, riche de gnration en gnration), qu'il y a toujours eu des nouveaux riches et encore heureux car ?a donne la possibilit de se dire qu'on peut commencer en bas de l chelle et que peut tre un jour nous aussi on sera riche !!    Je n'apprcies pas certains nouveaux riches mais c'est bien pour eux qu'ils le soient devenu !! Faut pas envier les autres, ?a rends plus amre de ce qu'on a pas !!|`|vpimAMECaa	En gnral, des gens dcevants apprciant le " clinquant " roulant en BMW avec un truc pendant au rtroviseur, et utilisant leur argent en le montrant ce qui est d'un parfait mauvais go?t !  Vous regardez l'immense majorit des vedettes ( stars ) vous aurez une bonne ide du parvenu !  Les arrivistes,  l'inverse de ceux qui ont les moyens depuis longtemps, emploie leur argent sans discrtion et sans discernement et c'est cela qui les rend souvent odieux !|`|894081d398f0daa83bf6d3eb78f45000aa	Dtestables!Ils se croient tout permis comme si leur oseille toute fra?che leur donnait une immunit...Je suis assez fier de ne pas en connaitre personnellement.|`|2i2MjTI4aa	Genre Sarkozy ?    Chemise ouverte avec chaine en or, aucune classe, une fa?on de parler qu'on croirait qu'il vient du fin fond d'la creuse ?    Mais qui se prend pour un prince ?    C'est de ?a que tu parles ?|`|a96ae4ab7f0e2f66a2d37bdd82359adbaa	Pas pires que les anciens!|`|0g80uNZwaa	Et les nouveaux pauvres alors, ils sont pourtant plus nombreux !!!!!!!!|`|c86cb536041e307514081e03b00133c8aa	qu'ils sont tous nouveaux tous beaux|`|a3c2cf00ffff22abfe7d35cbd88754fdaa	tant qu'il ne volent pas cette argent et que c'est dans le respect et la dignit de l'humain de l'animal et de la nature , aucun problme, mais c'est peu probable .
