They eventually found out that he was innocent & finally accepted it was another guy. I think he was in jail for 4 years..unless im wrong.

20090304111020AAIkh89	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Can you extend the earphones cables by soldering it?	I plan on changing the Jack on my Earphones. But I have a problem. The wire is already short. I don't want to use a male, then a female, then a male output.       For example, I added the new 1\8" Connector on my short cable lines. Then, I bought the Extension cable Female and male end. Then attached the female end of the extension to the newly connector I soldered on my short cable.         Earphones -> Cable -> Earphone jack 1/8" -> (extension female to male) -> Mp3 Device.      I have other earphone cables here. I'm asking if it's possible and will it work if I solder the Wires from my earphones to my other used earphones cable so I can extend them. Like, Soldering the Red wire on my earphones to the red wire of the spare earphones cable I'm going to use.      Earphones cable -> Soldering to Old earphones cables -> Connector -> mp3 player      Thanks in advance. Planning on buying the connector this weekend.

20090304123330AAb3o8u	Consumer Electronics;TVs	Has HD TV pricing hit the bottom yet?	I saw a Westinghouse HD TV at Target for $383.  It is a 32'' 720p display.  The colors and contrast looked great, even next to a larger Samsung that was also on display.      I am willing to settle for 720, since it is a smaller display and the viewing distance will be approximately 8ft.      Should I jump on this deal?  Or should I wait for prices to come down even further?  Will prices even come down at all, at this point?

I have started repairing my own xbox 360, so far replacing the thermal paste under the heatsinks has managed to keep it working, but I sense that the X-clamps have been re-used too many times and now apply little pressure,   therefore I have opted to replace the clamps with screws, with washers.   I will also drill the neccesary hole in the case.   My Question; Can anyone help me with what I'm going to need in order to complete this X-clamp repair.   I know there are Xbox 360 repair Guides which you can buy, but I feel I'm already quite comfortable with the repair, I just don't know the stuff Im gonna need

20090304120940AAweK2C	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	How can I waive a cancellation fee with at&t?	Last year the track ball broke on my blackberry.  I had to sign another 2 year contract to get a new phone.  I have now been stuck with at&t contracts for 3 years total.     Last week, my trackball broke again.  When I went to the store I had two options - sign another contract (which brings me to 5 years stuck with at&t) and still pay full price for the phone - or just buy a new phone without the contract.  Both options would cost me over $300.  Although I am eligible for an upgrade in may, they wouldn't budge and still said I would have to pay full price plus $75 for upgrading before my contract allowed.  I asked about the termination fee and they said that if I wanted it waived or pro-rated that I would have to call customer service.     I needed a phone with PDA and couldn't wait three months for a new phone, so I went to T-mobile and bought a new phone and cancelled my contract with at&t.  I ended up paying $200 less than I would have paid at at&t as an existing customer.  Awesome - except when I called customer service today, they say that there is nothing they can do as far as waiving the fee and to go to the store that gave me my information.     I am extremely frusterated to be put in this position and need to know if there is any way to waive this fee.  I was with at&t for years with multiple accounts in my family and the fact that they could do nothing for me and gave me misleading information is completely ridiculous.

Okay, So I have a newer phone, And i bought a 1 GB mem. stick for it, and I used my dad's laptop to put music onto it.  It worked perfectly fine.  So, i was content, but when I used my laptop (it was not working atm I used by dad's) i tried to hook up the card to my laptop, which by the way is newer than his.  It wont load the card.  (Btw, I use an SD adapter to connect it to my laptop).  I plug it in, and nothing pops up or anything, Its not the adapter or the card, because it still works fine with his laptop.  I just dont think it would be my laptop either, but Idk if there is anything else I can do to my laptop to get it too read.  It would be nice, becaue all of my music is on my laptop.      Any suggestions?     Thank you, in advance

I like the fact that the x3 is wireless, but I can't find anything about battery life...  and exactly how much of a bother would the wires be on the x1? my friend made it sound like you had 3 different wires sticking out of your head when you use it...      so x3: worth the extra 50 dollars? battery life? comfortable? dependable?      x1: quality? wires get in the way? how long are they?       any ADDITIONAL information would be appreciated... thanks guys =]

My husband has bought a satellite dish and installed it himself, and has aligned it according to info he has downloaded from the internet. I have double-checked, and he DOES seem to have got the alignment about right.  The previous owners of the property had a dish, so all the cabling was already installed.      Hubby has connected all the cables, but 1) is using a "splitter" to connect the cables in the loft, and 2) is also having to extend from the points in the living room to the box by using standard aerial cable.      Am getting to the point where I am insisting on getting a man in to sort it out, although this will cost a lot (to us) of money.        Hubby has been up a ladder with a compass for 2 days now, in snow, hail and rain, and I am being run ragged, with no result.      Would be grateful for any hints/info, or any idea where we may be going wrong.      When we fire up the box, it cannot find a stable signal. It flashes up occasionally, anything between 10% & 100% on "signal strength", & nothing on "quality"      Anyone have any ideas? If so, please let me know in simple language suitable for an idiot.

This has happened to 2 previous different brands?? first arcing, or some sort of bright light, and smoke, then on my old microwaves, the plastic in the middle under the plate actually caught fire. The first model which was 2nd hand and in perfect condition, was in use for a year when there was a sudden loud pop and a massive puff of dark smoke came out from underneath the microwave!!   I am wondering if this an electric circuit/wiring problem in my home. If it makes a difference the microwaves have always been positioned on a thick sturdy kind of shelf, but above a very vigorous washing machine when on full spin??    Another fact to mention that maybe of some relevance is that i have an electric pay as u go type system, that has shut off at times, and when the electricity is turned back on the microwave has still been plugged into the mains, although the arc/smoke problems haven't occurred straight after?? help!!

And then today (Wed.) he turned it on and received thee oh-so-fantastic 3 red lights. After having it for just 2 days!! I bought it new from the store. Anyway, my question to any of you who might know, is since it's brand new, do you know if Microsoft uses a faster shipping? Cuz I've had this problem on my own before, and I'd say 95% of the time your system is gone is because it's in shipping (either to there or on the way back). They usually only have the unit for like a day. So do you know if they'll bump up the shipping speed since it's still under it's original 90 day warranty? Thanks in advance.

I want to record a CD onto a blank to make a back up of it, when I click to copy from CD, it made a list and said it had been added to the library, there was the original in the top drive, the blank in drive below, when finished, I put the back up in my CD player, it didnt play anything, I then tried putting the blank in the top drive and selecting copy to CD, I then loaded up the library list and both disc drives , one says please insert a blank CD, even though its already been inserted, the other says, theres no CD in the drive when in fact there is, any ideas on how to make it work anyone?
20090227071801AABpo0d	Consumer Electronics;Camcorders	Is PAL 1080p/25 hd video always interlaced?	The reason I'm asking is because I'm getting confused.      My camera (Panasonic HDC-HS9) is filming at it's highest rate of 1920x1080p and it's a PAL camera as I'm in the UK, so I'm assuming it's 25fps.      The native AVCHD format is a bit too much for my system, so I'm trying to encode the video to a format with similar quality with the Adobe Media Encoder.      Even when I bring a raw .m2ts straight from the camera into Premiere, the footage looks interlaced in the monitor window.      If anyone could shed a little light, that'd be great as I'm very confused.      Many thanks
