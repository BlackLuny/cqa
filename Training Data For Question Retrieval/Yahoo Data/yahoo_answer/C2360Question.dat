20090307084825AAZXxO1	Education & Reference;Standards & Testing	SAT score range question, 100 point range, what did i get?	So I bough the big blue SAT book from the college board at a borders down the street. So I did the Critical Reading test on one of the practice tests and scored myself. When I plugged my raw score (61) in to the conversion table, it gave me a 100 pt range: (670-770). But 670 is very different from 770. I know that this means that on a given test, adjusted for difficulty, blah blah blah, I would get between there, but I want to know what I got in this particular test. The halfway mark is 720, so should I assume that that is the score I got?

20090505130554AAUBcVW	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Is My Essay On Animal Abuse Alright So Far?	Okay, I just started a  new highschool today, and they were already writing essays in my english class, so I had to catch up quickly. I did mine on child abuse, (Informational essay). And I just wanted to know how it is so far, I've only done 3 parts so far.          Everyday, animals are inhumanly used for human purposes, are left suffering, or are cruely executed.   Some people find purpose in cruely killing an animal for a human need, such as food. Pet owners are also apart of the animal abuse conern, even if they are though to love their pets. Finally, there has been laws and regulations enacted in certain countries where animal abuse is known to exist. Many animal rights groups and individual people are against the known animal cruelty and are now finally becoming known.         Certain groups of people around the globe believe that animal cruelty abuse is needed, and/or is okay when it comes to human needs. For instance, when food is needed in an area they believe it is okay to harmfully execute ANY animal, for the need. In certain countries, groups of people  will beat an animal , and will put it through a time of suffering before they use it for food, or anything else. Also executing an animal harshly for food isn't uncommon either. At times an animal could be stripped painfully of it's fur  while it is still alive. Often animals that are killed to satisfy a human need, will go to waste when there is a low demand for the product/need. It definatly seems cruel and unfair to cruely abuse these animals in such a way in which they are left suffering.             Pets are thought to be taken in by loving owners who say they will care for them, but that isn't always the case. Some owners that take in new animals don't actually realize what they have gotten themselves into. Pet owners may easily become frustrated and some may even feel the need/want to lash out their anger on their pet. Physical harm to the pet could be an outcome to this problem. Kicking, hitting, any act to physically harm the animal could come from this... ( Not finished).            Thanks in advance.

In Fall of 2008, I was selected for verification meaning that my parents were required to send in their W2's and tax returns so that the counselor could compare that information with what was submitted on my fafsa. However my parents refuse to send in this information because they didn't want me to attend the college I was attending. As a result I was unable to receive my Lottery Scholarship and State Grants. Therefore I had no way to pay full tuition for school. So I ended up not attending school that semester as well as this one. So I've been out of school for a full academic year because documents of my parents failed to be turned in. Right now I am preparing to attend school this upcoming fall semester and I've filed my taxes and fafsa as an independent only to find out that my parents claimed me as a dependent again on their taxes. My question is Isn't there a law that requires my parents to submit IRS documents and if they refuse they can no longer claim me as a Dependent on their taxes?

Here's part of my story: (When something is in parentheses it means it should be italicized.)      "Zack didn’t have to look far to find something out of the ordinary. In the middle of the third shelf, there was a red leather-bound book with gold runes on the cover.   “Come look at this,” he called, brushing off the dust and carefully flipping the thin, yellow pages. He froze as he saw a sketch on one of the pages.   (That’s me.)   He flipped another page. And another.   (And there’s Jenna...And Max...And Spencer...And Rin...)   By now, all of the others were gathered around the book.   “What is this?” Jenna whispered. “And why are we in it?”   Zack looked up. Everyone was staring at the book, except for Rin, who had a far-away look in her eyes. Her expressionless face suddenly went pale and fearful.   (What could she be remembering?)   Her mouth moved and what she whispered was barely audible, but he saw that they were the words on the page in front of him:"      Then Rin says the spell and they get transported to a temple place. Anyway, what should the spell be? I want something that's NOT English and sounds cool.

20090227134610AAKX0gb	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	Should I go to a Christian school?	Okay, so I'm a freshman and I've gotten so sick of my public High School. Half the kids act like 5 year olds, and the other half have NO class. I don't go to church, I'm not terrible interested in it, but I do believe in God and I am a Christian. I am willing to learn more about God and Jesus if it means getting out of public school. I also think that    the kids at a Christian school would be more like me. I am upper-middle class and enjoy luxuries such as vacations and expensive clothing. My dad says that my (rich) Grandparents would probably not have a problem with sending me to a Christian school. I am aware that going to a Christian school would mean leaving my friends. What would a Christian school be like? Tuition around here is about $7,000 a year. Thanks!

20090307084007AAlA9fD	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	What to do about annoying college students?	I am a T.A. in College, I have a student, a girl who keeps disturbing my class by her weird remarks, I mean, whenever I assign a homework, she has to say that she doesn't understand anything. And she says it in class, well, I hold office hours during the week and the students are more than welcome to come and ask any question they may have about the homeworks or the course. This student waits for the last minute and then says in class that she doesn't understand anything about a particular question when the homework is due. I am not sure exactly what her problem is, but I have the feeling that she enjoys seeing me embarassed in front of other students . Anyways, I give her decent grades, she is a B-B+ student, so she really is not failing this class. Well, it came to the point when my whole day gets ruined by her remarks during class. I also have really good students who want to listen and work hard for this class. I am wondering, what should I do about her? Should I call her in my office and tell her to stop disturbing my lectures, or what should I do to have a normal atmosphere in my class with a student like that?

There's an awful teacher for one of my community college classes and it's driving me crazy. Her background and the class apparently bring up a lot of hate issues, and she definitely demonstrates this hate. She is angry all the time. She repeatedly tells us what a good teacher she is--therefore, we should accept it when she calls us out in class and treats us like children.      I have taken many classes in many different areas and have a good GPA. So, I know I'm not just complaining for no reason; this woman is an awful teacher. We don't learn anything, and she gives all good grades--after multiply berating us. I'm guessing this latter fact is so we can't technically complain.      Have you ever had a class like this? I don't have the option of dropping; (I need to graduate).

Or add anything you want. Thank you so much!   Being a leader means a great deal to me. I don’t think it should ever be about being acknowledged for your actions and getting credit for what you do. Instead, leadership should be about how one can use their strengths to help a community, a cause or just a random group of people. Leadership should never be based on only one person, and one idea, though it can often seem that way.

Professor Dr. Christoph Scherrer, heading the GPE and LPG programs at Kassel University, has attempted to rape Jewish and Muslim students. Yet the students of the Global Political Economy program (nearly all of whom are Christians from either Germany or Russia) act deaf, dumb and blind when he misbehaves toward Jewish and Muslim women in the classroom. All of the students are so dull that the best universities in the world would reject them. Moreover, the president of the Kassel University refuses to take action against Professor Christoph Scherrer. Clearly, something should be done about this Nazi program. What do you think?
