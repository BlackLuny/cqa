20070729123133AADVvhR	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	ATF vs. Power Steering Fluid?	I was checking the fluids in family's 1990 toyota cressida and noticed one of the fluids is kind of low.  The cap to the container that holds the fluids says Power Steering fluid.  So i would assume its power steering fluid.  However, it also says "use ATF or Dexon II type fluids".  I look through my auto fluids which my father usually handles but I noticed two different bottles.  1) Power Steering fluid 2)ATF fluid with Dexon.  What is the difference? Is there suppose to be a type that I have both? Which one should I use?      Thanks

20080928140026AADFv4N	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	2003 Honda Civic gas mileage?	I got a 2003 Honda Civic EX sedan with about 100,000 miles about a month ago, one of the reasons being is because they are supposed to get really good gas mileage. Mine doesn't seem to be getting overly good gas mileage though, something under 20 miles to a gallon. My maintenance indicator light came on and since then, my gas mileage seems to be getting worse. Of course I am going to take it in to have the routine maintenance done, but will that help put my gas mileage up where it's supposed to be? Does anyone have any other suggestions on how to get better gas mileage? I drive about 12 miles round trip to school each day and my car is always empty. My tires were slightly over inflated the last time I checked...and I usually just use the basic unleaded gas.

20090305035507AAP5VH6	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Can I keep my salvaged car and claim on the insurance?	I crashed my car and (due to it's age and the damage) the insurance company wants to scrap it. I told them that I would like to keep it and claim on the insurance to get it back on the road. I was told by provident insurance that i could claim the value of the vehicle (minus a salvage percentage) and get it repaired. When I spoke to someone else (at provident) last night they said that that wasn't possible and that i must let them scrap the car or have it back and not claim! What is the point of having insurance! I am going to fight them all the way, but where do i stand? I know many people who have had their vehicles back and claimed and had the cars repaired. Please help!

20090305045312AAO5oeA	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Should I have to pay a diagnostic charge bill?	The tail light circuit in my car kept shorting, so I brought it to the dealer and had them run diagnostics for two hours, and still, they couldn't figure it out. They said they had their best mechanic working on it (40+ years) and to come back the next day since they were closing. I went home and tried unplugging my stereo and replacing the fuse, which fixed the problem in 5 minutes. In addition, my remote starter no longer works. It was fine before they messed with the wiring. The seat belt and overdrive lights also start to blink randomly now. Would this be a legitimate argument for small claims court? They were supposed to diagnose the problem and fix it instead of making things worse. I've also heard wiring problems can't be diagnosed by hooking it up to the computer. This all takes place in Connecticut.
