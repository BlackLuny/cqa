To learn a particular list of words quickly, though, you will have to just buckle down and memorize some of them.  <br>  <br>  You can use flash cards;  the ones you make yourself on index cards are the best because the act of writing the words and their meanings will help set them in your memory.  Or you can make a list, with words in one column and definitions in another.  <br>  <br>  Don't try to learn all thousand words at once, although you might want to go all the way through them once just to remove the ones you're already sure of.  This will shorten the list right away, which might make you feel somewhat better starting out.  It will be much less intimidating if you work on  ten or twenty words at a time, and it is easier to carry just a couple of short lists or card packets in your pocket for whenever you have a few spare minutes.<br>  <br>  If you will take a moment on each word to notice the root word and any prefixes and/or suffixes, you will be better able  to decipher the words, should your memory fail, when you get to the test itself.<br>  <br>  And yes, people do actually use SAT vocabulary in daily life.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I am currently studying to take the GRE (Graduate Record Exam) to get into Grad school and attain my Masters Degree.<br>  <br>  The standardized test I am studying for requires many vocabulary questions.

FKf7K6sKaa	Good question! I think you know I've asked the same question and also given a very detailed answer...<br>  <br>  The answer is God!<br>  <br>  Just like the evils! Most people say Satan has created evil ... But it IS God who created Satan! <br>  <br>  If God is omnipotent and omniscient while at the same time evil exists. God either cannot stop evil or he/she will not. If he/she cannot then he/she is argued to not be omnipotent! <br>  <br>  Based on their sinning?! Hahha! Good joke! One can't do anything without God ... We are just a flesh-stuffed robot in the hands of God... (We can think, plan, dream but can we execute all our plans, dreams, thinking's?! The answer is NO!)<br>  <br>  Here I like to quote this! <br>  <br>  Nicolaus writes that in the days leading up to the assassination, Caesar was told by doctors, friends, and even his wife, Calpurnia, not to attend the Senate on the Ides for various reasons, including medical concerns and troubling dreams had by Calpurnia:<br>  <br>  "...his friends were alarmed at certain rumors and tried to stop him going to the Senate-house, as did his doctors, for he was suffering from one of his occasional dizzy spells. His wife, Calpurnia, especially, who was frightened by some visions in her dreams, clung to him and said that she would not let him go out that day. But Brutus, one of the conspirators who was then thought of as a firm friend, came up and said, 'What is this, Caesar? Are you a man to pay attention to a woman's dreams and the idle gossip of stupid men, and to insult the Senate by not going out, although it has honored you and has been specially summoned by you? But listen to me, cast aside the forebodings of all these people, and come. The Senate has been in session waiting for you since early this morning.' This swayed Caesar and he left."<br>  <br>  Caesar planned to leave Rome for the East in the latter half of March, which forced a timetable onto the conspirators. Two days before the actual assassination, Cassius met with the conspirators and told them that, should anyone discover the plan, they were to turn their knives on themselves."<br>  <br>  Note: Julius Caesar, the World Famous Political Leader neglected his trustworthy members like his friends, doctors, and even his beloved wife, Calpurnia and he also thought to leave Rome for the East ... But what happened at last?! According to Eutropius, around sixty or more men participated in the assassination. He was stabbed 23 times. According to Suetonius, a physician later established that only one wound, the second one to his chest, had been lethal. He was assassinated... Brutus is also Caesar's best friend... Why did Brutus act like that?!<br>  <br>  You may say... God has given free will and going to hell or heaven is only in our hands... Again it's a good joke! N mere escapism! God has given free will just to create anarchy... Satan with his/her evil squad in addition to viruses n diseases are helping God! <br>  <br>  Now imagine this...<br>  <br>  There is no use of doctors if there are no diseases n if there are no thieves... There is no use of Police... Just like that people will start to neglect God if there are no evil and diseases!<br>  <br>  How many of you respect your teachers after finishing your studies? Mostly they won't because there is no use in respecting them... (But I DO respect them) <br>  <br>  Will one work without salary? Nope! Just like that people respect if there is some profit...<br>  <br>  (Teachers taught you just like God creating you)<br>  <br>  N my answer is God is just like Humans...<br>  <br>  God created Humans<br>  Humans created Computers<br>  <br>  God created viruses, bacterias, fungi etc. to harm Humans<br>  Humans created viruses, trojans, worms etc. to harm Computers<br>  <br>  God is operating Humans<br>  Humans are operating Computers<br>  <br>  My final answer is "HIGHER POWER DOMINATING THE LOWER POWER!" It's that much simple! :)<br>  <br>  You may say life is a mixture of good and bad and it will be boring if there is no bad...<br>  <br>  My answer is NO! There must be only POSITIVE COMPETITION! Mostly BAD OVERTAKES GOOD... Mostly if one is shining well... The other will not work hard to overtake... He/she will evil plot... If there is positive competition.... one will take strenuous effort to overtake the other and other will also take strenuous effort to retain... <br>  <br>  Imagine a class of students full of intelligent students and teachers... Everyone will work hard to overcome the other... As a result what happens?! Everyone will work hard and it won't be boring...<br>  <br>  Now imagine a class of a single or some intelligent students... What will happen?! In the first situation the intelligent student himself/herself will get bored eventually and in the next situation... Other than those students... others will get bored eventually!<br>  <br>  Now say which one is better!|`|NXCMRb8waa	A number of possible explanations:<br>  <br>  1. There is no God<br>  <br>  2.

It tests our faith in God, in ourselves, and in others. We never know how strong we are until we become brave enough to face it. <br>  Trust me, I'm younger than you are, but I've faced a lot in my life. There were times when I was about to lose hope, but it was only when I became brave enough to face everything that I discovered my strength and was able to overcome those obstacles. It wasn't until those hard times have passed that I realized that they did me some good. They helped me become wiser and stronger. They also made me appreciate my life and the people and things in it a lot more.<br>  My point is that there is a reason behind everything that happens.

I believe in a God who created this world. I also believe in science's answers to a lot of these questions, because they don't flout common sense or our daily observations. This world was not just invented, kerplop.<br>  <br>  It is part of the Universe, which seems to have originated (at least the neighborhood we live in -- the expanse of space which is observable to us) billions of years ago. They even have a sort of rough estimate of the age of the Universe. That's not really important. What is important, at least  for me, is the apparent development of this world out of the chaos of the Universe.<br>  <br>  It bears every sign of being allowed to form in what way it will. Likewise, in every situation, the world has developed independently, without any tweaking (that we know of) by some watchmaker. I like to say the entire world -- the entire universe -- is free, and if you wish you might say the world has free will. God has set up this situation whereby we have freedom from any constraints from God. We are only free because the entire world also is free -- free to spawn viruses, tornadoes, earthquakes, cancer, etc. We humans are free to be what we want to be -- saints, carpenters, bricklayers, farmers, serial killers. <br>  <br>  So my opinion is that there are bad things in the world because the world is free, must be free so that we can be free. <br>  <br>  Negative situations also serve a s growing experiences, so it's a sort of win-win situation if you buy the idea that we are here to learn something or some things. In my opinion, this is the only way the world makes sense.<br>  <br>  Your mileage may vary.|`|A01w1dHqaa	We think they make us sick because we believe we need to be sick.

AA10945101	Major gains.<br>  <br>  Five years ago it was a small southern Baptist church with one service in a building that held about 300 people.  By 2007, they were holding six services a week in the same building AND broadcasting to an additional location in another town.  Then, in mid December last year, we moved to a new building that seats about 700 in three services...and it has grown so much in the last two months that they're adding a fourth service next week.  We've also added two additional remote locations (video broadcasting to locations in other cities) and the original remote location recently went to two services and is talking about adding a third service (weekly attendance of about 500 at that location).<br>  <br>  The church is still affiliated with the southern Baptist convention but you wouldn't know that unless you searched their charter...it basically operates like a non-denominational church.|`|j3wXdTuuaa	In the last 7 years my church went from five people meeting in the basement of one of the founding members to well over four hundred people who regularly attend.It happened in an area where there was an opportunity for growth and God put the right person in place.<br>  <br>  <br>   Apostolic-pentecostal(oneness)|`|m4geUBLTaa	gained. <br>  and we moved buildings from a small one to a very bigger one thats more in town (it was the old walmart) and tons of people came to visit, saw how nice it was and we gained rougly 1000 new people.<br>  <br>  and its christian, i guess its just the christian denomination b/c its harmony christian church.<br>  <br>   i used to be baptist though. and at my old church that i went to has lost a lot of people b/c theyre outdated and people want change, and the baptist wasn't about to do that.|`|L8yKZ1TRaa	I come from a Church of roughly 100 members.

Same when people say that about german. English actually sounds far worse. Hear some REAL Russian, spoken normally, and get away from the stereotypical movies and cartoons. I met a Russian person and they sounded very nice.<br>  <br>  And to the girl who said Japanese sounds angry, nooo it does not. It's very melodic and flowing; of course if they ARE yelling, NO language will sound nice when yelling.

6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	No, I would certainly be upset.  For some reason people think that because "children are our future" that a pregnant belly is public property.  She invaded your personal space and made deliberate contact with a stranger.  I wouldn't be surprised if she went up to a woman with big fake boobs and squeezed them to see if they felt as fake as they looked.  Seriously!  It's the same thing.  <br>  <br>  You have every right to say something.  The next time you see a stranger's hand zooming in to touch your child, before or after birth (because they will try touching babies, too), put up your hand and say, "Please don't.  It makes me uncomfortable."|`|ADP9swbMaa	It's not wrong for you to get upset. For some reason, many people think it's perfectly acceptable for a complete stranger to feel and pregnant woman's stomach. Many other people think it is completely not acceptable and, in fact, a little creepy. If you are of the latter group, there is nothing wrong with you. In fact, I hear you on that one! But it might help to understand that some people find it acceptable and even completely normal for whatever reason that we do not understand.|`|rThIVk2maa	No, you are not wrong to be annoyed. I don't know what it is about pregnant women that makes people think they want to be touched, but it's rude. <br>  <br>  What you can say is "I'm sorry, I'm asking that everybody wait until the baby is born before they try to hold her." Said with a mischievous smile, people tend to chuckle and back off.|`|Z7KRAzbeaa	You were not wrong to get upset, but it was nice that you didn't blow up at the lady.  My first pregnancy a man did that to me.  Freaked me out to be rubbed.  ugh!  From then on, I had "radar" for the touchy people.  I would back away quick and say "don't touch me"...calmly.  Or get my purse in front of my stomach.  Any barrier.  I don't think the people know what they are doing and how offensive it is.  You might want to prepare yourself for them trying to touch your baby too.  Get ready.  I had one person take the pacifier out of my babies mouth.  ugh!  Needless to say, it didn't get put back in my child's mouth. I guess you have to start now to protect your child.  Perhaps that is what it's all about.|`|R2iCzRjsaa	Glad you didn't say anything, write it off to being 8 months pregnant.  Smile, and think she was happy to talk with you and pat your belly.|`|AA11773731	There's nothing wrong with that. She invaded your personal space without your permission. That was rude.|`|AA10819407	No, you were not wrong..It is very rude when someone touches<br>   another, no matter what the reason...As for the " Wow" comment<br>  "wow" what a big mouth she had ..|`|IB2V5t1Oaa	Some pregnant women don't mind this while others do. If it bothered you, you should've told her to stop. :-||`|TcMa4a7paa	No, you have a right to be upset.  Even though the lady may have had good intentions, you can't just go around feeling on people you don't know!  Hopefully, there won't be a next time but if there is, try backing up and saying, "I'm sorry.  Do I know you?"  <br>  BTW, congratulations. :o)|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	I was just the other day wondering how pregnant women can stand total strangers barreling up to them and touching their stomachs. I couldn't bear that. I  think I would flip out anytime someone came near me after a few rubs.<br>  I don't know why people think a baby bump gives them permission to touch a total stranger and make comments. Having a baby doesn't make you public property.|`|AA10979361	Nobody has the right to put their hands on you, unless you give permission.  She was in the wrong, AND she was totally rude at the same time!!  <br>  You displayed great self control!  I'm guessing that little trials like that could reflect how you would handle situations in motherhood when your baby does things that annoy you.  <br>  <br>  Next time someone does something like that to you, just announce that you are not even pregnant!! Won't THAT make them feel terrible! HA HA HA!|`|irLnPW4aaa	I used to hate that when I was pregnant.  I don't know why people think that they are automatically allowed to touch a pregnant woman's belly.  I mean, they wouldn't touch my stomach if I weren't pregnant, would they? That's just plain rude.<br>  <br>  You are not wrong.|`|vG0tsqJtaa	You were rude.  Once your pregnant your body becomes the worlds to touch.<br>  No seriously.  I am sure she was trying to be nice, but you should touch anyone you don't know.  Especially without there permission.|`|AaknZ1RHaa	It would depend with me. If it was an older woman (elderly) then no I wouldn't be upset.<br>  <br>  Yes, it was wrong to pat your belly without permission. Next time say something to that person.|`|ZhhH5cAdaa	No.<br>  Good you didn't say anything tho, she was just trying to be nice|`|igI5yX0vaa	Not at all.  I would have screamed "Don't touch me!".  Maybe they won't assume the next time.|`|hLohtlPEaa	No, you're not wrong but get over it real quick. You can't control the world.|`|32b5862608cd641eff2b289e3a95ca58aa	Your annoyance was understandable...it used to get me riled up a little when people did that to me, but people tend to think of your 'baby bump' as a separate entity from you and forget that they're still invading YOUR personal space.  I think they feel like they're touching the baby...and not you.|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Wow, some people are so rude. I'm sorry she did this to you. People need to lear to keep their hands to themselves! That was very nice of you to ignore her. If I were you I would have grabbed her hand and broken it. lol.|`|VMY7No0eaa	The BEST THING you could have done was .. is just GLARE at them.<br>  and say "don't touch me" !<br>  <br>  People want to pat a PG belly almost like touching a baby...<br>  in the past it was not taboo.<br>  <br>  your harmonal but people need to ASK to touch you.|`|xnsU60hhaa	You were not wrong to get upset. She had a lot of nerve actually touching you! If my mother EVER does that to you again, slap her!

But you are part of this world, evolved and grown to fit into and understand it.  When you're born, the light entering your eyes is random, meaningless noise.  Then you learn to interpret it and find meaning.  Of COURSE things are going to seem "well designed" to you: your eyes filter out what doesn't make sense to you; your ears ignore sounds that aren't useful.  Your fingers pick up touches that tell you things, like you're holding too tightly, or this is soft, or this is hot.  But actually, there's no such thing even as a solid object.  The desk your computer is probably sitting on is not a solid object; it's a mesh of atoms with big holes between them, pushing other atoms away, due to the energy fields in different objects repelling each other.<br>  <br>  The fact is, as human beings, we have no clue where the universe came from.  God, some giant kid's daydream, our own mad delusions when we're really locked up in a mental institution imagining ALL of this... no one knows.  It's just arrogance to assume we do.  And maybe THAT is what religion mean when they talk about God being unknowable.  Maybe you're NOT supposed to believe in God as an intelligent being that exists and creates stuff.

The thing is none of us should be judge mental...people are who they are and they believe what they believe and that should be okay.

6uFaP2OAaa	It's a shame you didn't get picked, you sound like you would've been good for the job.<br>  But what about the other people in the final 32 that didn't get selected either?  Many of them probably feel the same way.<br>  The people that were chosen were probably chosen for variety, as well as their skills.  I've been on a college welcoming/orientation week committee myself.  A few people that were selected to be on there with me were surprises; they were quiet and didn't seem right for the job.  But the thing is, that some new kids are quiet and shy too.  They don't always want someone loud and confident to help them out; they want someone to relate too.  Which is why most groups like that always put in a few quiet kids. <br>  <br>  And I do think everything happens for a reason.  Opportunities are thrown at us, and we've got to make the best of it.  Maybe because you weren't chosen, you'll try even harder to better yourself, and do brilliantly outside school.  Maybe some of the people who were chosen will think themselves too good, slack off and not do as well as they could have.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

I do not know when this was. Maybe it was after the Flood.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Biologically speaking, it makes perfect sense that incest back then would not have produced birth defects. When there were only few people in existence on earth, the DNA had not been multiplied and complicated through adaptations and such. Throughout the history of the propagation of the species, DNA complicated more so much so that the DNA of people who are immediately related to each other will "clash" so to speak, and that's why it is so risky for birth defects. Seems perfectly logical, God designed DNA to do this so that as the final era came in which the New Covenant is here and morality is revealed, it is also unhealthy for us to commit incest not only immoral.|`|RZetcwalaa	losasha kitteh wasnt asking if it was ok to indulge in incest, we usually reserve that for the southern evangelists such as yourself.|`|9DW9irIGaa	hmm, i guess we're not evolving after all ;)|`|LjsRfaskaa	The Christians are infamous for inventing waffle bolox to explain their organized cult's oxymoron's.

Whoever told you that,didn't understand anything they read. If you are reffering to Cain. Its not true. You need to understand that Adam & Eve were not the only human life forms on earth. <br>  There were other life forms. And no it wasn't adams  family. Adam was cretated to  tend to the garden.  And the same time. God was still creating  M&F. Ok.<br>   No one can say how long it was before Adam lived in the garden. Before God cretated Eve.  So during all this time period. There were other humans on earth. As for noah aqnd his family. You need to know , they lived a very long time. They were putting out children every year. As time went on.<br>   Before the great flood, angels of God would take the women of men. and they would bare their children.<br>   You  need to go back and read the bible for yourself. Thatw why it is confusing ot you . You beleive what others have told you. Instead of reading the bible yourself.<br>   Noah was 600 years old, and he had plenty of chilfren.  So the whole incest crap is just anothers person dirty mind. <br>  Or anothers thoughts. that beleived that. Because they didn't understand, the bible.So they came to their own conclusion. Because the didn't understand
lqP9ayLKaa	Interesting.<br>  <br>  If the flood myth is taken as true, and the bible assumed to be a literal work (yes, two major assumptions but I think I understand the point of your question), then it would have to be fairly soon after the flood waters dropped but not before - allowing the handful of surviving humans to breed like rabbits.<br>  <br>  There is some impressive mental gymnastics taking place for people of faith to justify the "Literal Truth" of the creation myth.<br>  <br>  If genesis is taken at face value, god created adam and eve. All humanity is descended from them - so there can have been no people from other lands for Cain and Able to marry. If we accept that there were humans on Earth that god didn't create then we are in a whole world of theological confusion - not that this is unusual of course...<br>  <br>  Now, the simplest and most elegant solution is to accept that the bible was never supposed to be taken literally...|`|AA11481603	The thing is, the Bible never tells you where the spouses of Adam and Eve's children came from, and only mentions that the wife of Cain was from another land. So, incest is only a guess, with the assumption that the descendants of Adam and Eve were the only humans on Earth. As a Christian, even I can see that the Bible doesn't tell us everything, so incest cannot be presumed. As a students of genetics, I can tell you that children of incest would have a higher tendency to have defects. Also, it would not be logical for a supreme being to create a race in which incest later became "taboo" but allow the beginnings of that race to commit incest by somehow changing how genes work. It makes much more sense to think that there are large parts of the story that we don't know.|`|DxDfa3E7aa	Well, personally, I don't believe those stories. I'm Wiccan. But what I do know is that if two people incestuously breed together, it doesn't automatically doom their children to birth-defect-dom. That happens when there is a genetic problem in the family and both parents are carriers. This makes their child(ren) much more likely to develop whatever it is that they carry, whether it's polydactyly (multiple fingers) or heart defects.|`|BAaf9NKdaa	Once Adam chose to be like God and ate from the tree of good and<br>   bad. At that point it took Adam 930 years to die. Being so close<br>   to Adam as his children would take a good while before those born<br>   by Adam and his more immediate offspring would be affected by<br>   extreme deforming harmful births due to incest. This period was<br>   over a long time frame as Methuselah lived within several years of the <br>   great flood of Noah's day reaching the age of 970 years even longer<br>   than Adam. With divine help in populating the earth God made a<br>   fulfillment of his command to Adam to multiply and fill the earth as <br>   it was known at that time.....sadly Adam produced imperfect children<br>   but God in the Garden of Eden made arrangements to help those<br>   children of Adam by means of the seed that was to come who would<br>   be faithfully loyal to Jehovah by means of his seed and the one who<br>   heads that seed, Jesus Christ......the period of life was shortened by<br>   Jehovah to about 120 years and during this period mankind by being<br>   unfaithful brought all kind of diseases upon themselves by their own<br>   choice of sexual perversions with multiple partners and close relatives.<br>   Incest was not given as a violation of God's law until Moses received <br>   the laws on Mt. Sinai...so it was not known by the peoples that<br>   God no longer approved of incest to populate until after the Israelites<br>   were freed from Eqypt....once these laws were given they showed <br>   how God truly felt and how his knowledge of being clean in all matters<br>   meant life to those who listened.....|`|2gyJUTzRaa	Adam and Eve are mythological characters...we didn't seriously descend from them.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	What did your algebra teacher say about assuming?

Number of Gods and Goddesses in Hinduism is higher hence the advantage is higher. Not only this most of this Gods or almost 99% of this Gods are older ..very older even before the rise of Christianity or Islam and some are even older than the evolution of man on earth. Muslims also have peers and religious Christian people who die and go in company of Christ are engaged in service of humanity through churches, internal mind prayers etc. but comparatively Hindu Gods being eldest they have a better grip on solving problems of humans. They can identify the desire of humans more closely and their care taking attitude and advantage gained is quite superior if looked upon from personal benefit attaining point of view. They might not enrich you with money or luxury but small delights of life like company of parents, attainment of true love, devotional feelings towards Krishna which is responsible for attainment of highest heaven after death etc. are some of the benefits in which Hindus take the credit. In my view Hindus are more advantageous.<br>  <br>  To be a Hindu and be cool perform fasts, vratas that please Lord Shiva or Lord Vishnu, don't eat meat,worship rising sun early in morning by offering the sun water or flowers etc. are some of the actions by which your mind will develop barriers against ills prevading in external world and that will do you more good.<br>  <br>  Regarding Vaishnavas it is said that true devotee of Lord Vishnu gains higher worlds after death. Not only this he is responsible for the release or betterment or rise of 21 forefathers residing in Pitar lok means father, his father,his father and so on. Pitar lok is a world where our forefathers have collected just bcos their good acts are not sufficient to make them attain heaven. Similarly bad acts have yet not risen to push them towards hell. They stand in Pitar lok and can observer their families. If families are non religious they repent heavily as they can see their children wasting their lives in sensual pleasures ignorant regarding the fact that life is a chance given to them by nature and if they slip this chance the mighty nature wud take them to other lower species say animal,birds,insects which is considered to be a very horrible attainment by humans bcos we all know in animal kingdom feelings have no place and cruelty and cruel deaths prevail in presence of carnivorous animals and insects. They just tremble bcos if their family members are not religious that means not only their family member but also they standing up in the Pitar lok will be doomed either to hell or lower species. This advantage or making 21 family cycles released from Pitar lok towards heaven and other good attainments is mentioned just in Hinduism. So if your heart says become Hindu then its clear God residing in your heart has put some light in you or perhaps someone from Pitar lok ...your fathers father or his father's repentance thought is grabbed by your heart which leaded to rise of such thought within your mind.<br>  <br>  Although worshippers of Jesus might be having this ability of releasing 21 family cycles but it is not quoted by any of the Christians bcos most of them are unaware of the existence of such worlds. Among Hindu Gods only Lord Vishnu is given the credit and only his worshippers I have heard about having the ability to protect 21 previous family cycles or forefathers from fury of hell and rebirths in various species cycle|`|wKN7n2RKaa	I was told by an Indian woman years ago that you have to be born Hindu to be one.

hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.<br>  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.<br>  Would you accept the above argument. ?<br>  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.<br>  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

Science provides the best means to attain this ultimate goal.|`|URO3gDXcaa	proof is on the believer.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Your question is all over the place so I'm only  going to address one point.  First, you seem to misunderstand atheism.  Atheists aren't saying that have proof that there is no God.  They are saying that there is no proof that there is a God.  That may seem like a subtle distinction but it's a real one.<br>  <br>  As for your calculation, it doesn't matter what the odds were.  If they were better than zero, and we're here discussing it, then we beat the odds.  The odds calculation fails to take into account the number of worlds where life has developed.  We can speculate what that number might be but we don't know.  In our solar system there are about 100 worlds, planets, dwarf planets, moons, and we have landed probes or people to a total of 3.  We've barely scratched the surface in our search for extraterrestrial life.  The more planets develop simple life, the greater the chance that one of those life forms will evolve into something complex.  We can't truly estimate the likelihood of life firmly taking hold on a planet if we don't know the frequency of life developing in the first place.  That's the X factor that is missing from your equation and as I said, so far the sample size we've looked at is very small..|`|Xcri5qeTaa	I'll answer, but burden of proof is absolutely on those who claim the existence of something. This is an old canard which sounds good because it shifts burden to those who are saying, "prove your claim is true," with the childish response, "prove it isn't."<br>  <br>  Agree on #1 that religion and science cannot prove everything and don't have all the answers, and will point out that's because we are human, and there is no special knowledge gained from God which supersedes observable nature.<br>  <br>  #2 I disagree -- Science is not about proving religion right or wrong, it's about understand the observable, testable universe. We aren't talking about equal and similar fields, here.<br>  <br>  As to the odds you state on abiogenesis... it has little to do with odds, and everything to do with thermodynamics and chemistry. Anyway, it only had to happen once.<br>  <br>  And I bet you could accomplish all those things you mentioned given enough time.<br>  <br>  Monkeys aren't talking as far as you've thought about language, but that point is moot since monkeys and great apes diverged long ago, and while all vocalize, and have complex communication, humans have the greatest brain size. Species do not constantly develop along a set path, and it's rather speciesist of you to assume that human-like language is necessarily the next step in evolution for all primates.<br>  <br>  Consciousness doesn't "come from" anywhere, and it is biochemical. Why would you close yourself off to that fact? Obviously our chemistry and physiology are very much alike, but not exactly alike. Why would such similar composition necessarily mean we should think exactly the same? Your experiences are similar to mine, but not exactly the same. Yet we both have feelings, thought, memory, imagination, empathy, sympathy, etc.<br>  <br>  Love is a word we use for strong emotional attachment to another often characterized by feelings of longing and belonging.<br>  <br>  Present your God Theory and well discuss whether the facts support your theory.|`|czf6uhIraa	fail<br>  1)  You're the one making the claim, so burden of proof is on your back<br>  2)  If you factor in the trillions upon trillions of planets thought to be in the Universe, the chances are fantastic that life will spring up on atleast one.<br>  3) Because they do not posess the intelligence nor the special parts for speech.  However, they can communicate (like most mammals) with sounds and usually have their own primitive "language".<br>  4)Chemical reactions.  That's just it.  There's a difference between conciousness and personality.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	1.) And exactly where do you get those odds for life forming?  There remains insufficient evidence to compute the odds of life having occured on this planet, so anyone who tells you otherwise is lying.<br>  <br>  2.) Because talking is not evolutionarily advantageous in the environments monkeys live in.<br>  <br>  3.) We may be based on the same chemicals, but our brains are wired differently, and we exist in different environments.<br>  <br>  If I run different programs on different computer architectures (but those architectures are still made of the same three basic components - capacitors, resistors, and diode junctions), should I expect to get the same results?<br>  <br>  4.) A chemical reaction in the brain based on past experience and present stimulii.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	1) burden of proof is on the person making the claim, not the one rejecting the claim.<br>  <br>  2) is that probability for modern life (modern single celled organism) or something more primitive?<br>  <br>  3) what are you even asking about here?  apes cannot communicate like we do, but we cannot communicate like apes do, or wolves do.  Chimps can learn sign language and can communicate with other humans, therefore the ability to communicate through a form of language we can recognize is present.<br>  <br>  4) consciousness is a series of chemical reactions.  pretty much all animals with a developed brain are conscious (aware of their surroundings)  we are not the only animals to be so.  we are also not the only animal to be intelligent (intelligence being defined as the ability to learn).  again pretty much any animal with a developed brain can learn and is intelligent, some more so than others.<br>  <br>  5) love is the label we put on an emotion, which is a series of electro-chemical reactions.  what do you think is love may i ask?  does a mother bear love her cub?  does a mother chimp/gorilla love their child?<br>  <br>  now the million dollar question, can you answer any of those questions beyond a simple "goddidit"?  what is love?  what is consciousness? and where do they come from.  you would have to provide evidence along with your answer which is why "goddidit" does not work.|`|C42YeDPuaa	Based on your rant, there are two things you have no understanding of.  One is science and the other is religion.<br>  <br>  And if you made 3.9 x 10^372 soups what would your odds be then?<br>  <br>  Talking monkeys?

It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. QED.'<br>  'Oh dear,' says God, 'I hadn't thought of that,' and promptly vanished in a puff of logic.<br>  'Oh, that was easy,' says Man, and for an encore goes on to prove that black is white and gets himself killed on the next zebra crossing. Most leading theologians claim that this argument is a load of dingo's kidneys, but that didn't stop Oolon Colluphid making a small fortune when he used it as the central theme of his best- selling book Well That About Wraps It Up For God.<br>  <br>  Logiking the existence or non-existence of God is pointless.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	DRINK: Absence of proof does not reject proof of absence.

While I am not sure, I am certainly open to any tangible evidence. What evidence would convince you that g-d does not exist? Do you see the conundrum?<br>  <br>  Bible passages are not evidence of g-d's existence to me. This is my standard of proof, not yours. However, if proof were proffered that convinced me g-d exists, I would change absolutely nothing in my life or my behavior. Existence or not of g-d does not matter.<br>  <br>  What if evidence were produced that convinced you g-d does not exist with certainty (evidence according to your standards of proof)? What would you change in your life?<br>  <br>  - Would you stop evangelizing?<br>  - Would you start sinning more?<br>  - Would you stop helping those less fortunate than you?<br>  - Would you feel that life is meaningless?<br>  - Would you lose your Raison d'être?|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Ok, easy.  <br>  <br>  Show me your proof of god.  Logic dictates something cannot be proven to not exist without evidence proving it does.<br>  <br>  So your first step is show proof of your god.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I believe you need further education on statistics.  If there is 1 chance in let's say a googleplex, that just means you just have to have a googleplex worth of situations for that to occur.

Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit2: Ok then, I win welcome to atheism.  If you cannot provide proof of the god you claims exists, then because there is nothing fueling your argument I do not have to disprove your god.<br>  <br>  Well thought out questions may be further in need for you.

I mean christians make fun of other groups (ex. pagans), and really you can't name one time that any person belonging to a religion/lack there of, hasn't laughed or found humor when it came to theirs or another's religion. <br>  <br>  Oh and wb. here's a cookie for you *hands asker a cookie* don't ask for milk, i just ran out. (that cats drank it all)
AA11120822	Not exclusively, but certainly in large measure.|`|NQiVQmPUaa	i agree with upyr|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	Search your facts. <br>  Religious schools are so expensive to enroll in but for the promise of a good character development and disciplined students,  many parents are trying to find every means to have their children belong to those schools.<br>  I do not need to specify to you the kind of students (saving some great few) we have under the government fundings. The deterioration are often caused by political decisions not by any religion.|`|XEBpv9gwaa	There is no way to hold them responsible, nor do I think this should be done.  But I definitely think they have contributed in more ways than one to the deterioration of our educational system.<br>  <br>  Funny, the way to help to begin reversing the downward trend is education.  It's discouraging.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	No.  Politicians should be.<br>  <br>  Look, evangelicals may want garbage taught in the schools but it's the politicians who let the standards get so lax pandering to the evangelicals.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	No, let me see now, that would be the liberal socialist teachers and unions, not to mention the politically correct crowd|`|2567c53ea5be1f53420408d56fd5f4b4aa	They are responsible for a LOT of it.|`|5iiQnjE2aa	All americans share some blame in the poor state of education.<br>  Schools should be a place to learn how to critically think about the world. People today don't seem to know how to constructively scrutinize ideas or think for themselves. I blame general apathy by society, parents who are uninvolved and don't teach respect for education, and underfunding.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	As a federalist I have no problem with it. If local towns want their schools to be teaching nonsense go ahead, they'll just turn their communities into backwards slums that no one with a decent education will want to come anywhere near. <br>  I just think we need to get rid of the social welfare that overhwelmingly gets sent to these types of places. If people want their kids to be stupid don't make me subsidize them when they grow up and can't find a job.|`|P5rczL0Saa	How so? You want to be a little more specific on that?  I don't see how that can be since it's secular teaching that's in the schools, not Christian. You are allowed to teach you evolution lie. It has been that way for many, many, many years. satan has had his hand in education all along. <br>  "Wisdom of this world is foolishness to God."|`|XTyAMS5yaa	We should all be responsible. As should or government for public schools. Cutting education programs (not to mention No child left behind, stupid b.s that) is not a way to improve education. So it's not Christians, Muslim, Jews, or atheists who have the sole blame, but all of us are to blame.|`|LF4vun1maa	Where they are actually responsible, yes.  The various religiously motivated organizations that have tried to compromise the education system have broken laws in their efforts and should be held to account for it.|`|4Vt20nvoaa	ARE YOU SERIOUS?  SCHOOLS DIDN'T START GOING TO CRAP UNTIL AFTER THEY REMOVED PRAYER AND ALL OTHER CHRISTIAN FOUNDATIONS.  THIS "NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND STUFF IS WHAT'S GOING TO CATCH UP TO US.  WHEN KIDS GET INTO THE REAL WORLD AND THERE IS NO ONE TO HOLD THEIR HAND ANYMORE THEN WHAT?|`|G6JXHvZKaa	if we are gonna label  than blame our government!!!|`|K70Hkq5haa	No one party can be the cause of such a great problem. If anything, this nation was founded on Christian principles. We have lost sight as a nation the importance and value of education on all levels. As a result, this nation has a high drop out rate, overcrowded classrooms, lack of qualified personnel mainly teachers to list just some examples. It is the breakup of the 'family unit', cyles of poverty as well as many other factors that contribute to this problem. It is unfortunate that this nation that once was so rich is so poor. May we humble ourselves and rebuild so todays children can have a promising tomorrow.|`|GUTITGDlaa	Why would Christian fundamentalists be considered the cause of deterioration of education? They have no basis on public schools. I'd consider it the opposite - not having the fundamentals of <insert religion here> or spirituality would be the cause of deterioration of education in America. No morals, no ethics - downright downfall of America. <br>  <br>  You must be a lawyer...|`|P5AgKF9Yaa	no. every single american should. of course, it is true that countries like Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland where there is no religion involved in everyday life have the best education in the world. and guess what? they can afford to not perceive tuition fees for Universities...|`|4nAVWEjhaa	They should be held responsible for that and the poor economy, and lack of technology.  They should also quit judging others and look at their own miserable pathetic selves.|`|r8qJecrMaa	You colonials!<br>  F***ing daft or what!<br>  Dump the religious chumps! The rest of the civilised world is laughing at you!|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	we all should be held responible for this|`|RGabfWSVaa	no , it's a SHAME THAT *WE LET *THAT HAPPEN .
8Nqq7tkwaa	we have been asking for years to remove natives and native symbols as mascots. it insults and demeans us as people and often times mocks things we hold sacred. i'm a native mother who has seen my own children be humiliated by such displays at sporting or school events.<br>  but of course the arrogance of the dominant culture says "we are honoring you and you will be honored if we have to shove it down your savage throats"...and then they do. want to see how honored we are by them? read any online comments section about this issue and you will see how much they honor us. most are vulgar and many call for our deaths. how's that for honoring?<br>  <br>  this is not about honoring us. it never has been. its about entitlement. people  think they have the right to do whatever they want and you'll be damned if some savage is going to tell you that you can't. that's how it goes.|`|jcK6EXpiaa	If you have no problem with our tribal school using a slutty nun as our mascot, and perform the crucifixion at our foot ball game half times, then sure! Dehumanise our people into little more than mythical beasts.<br>  <br>  Edit: the term "red skins" was used to describe what native american flesh looked like after it was removed from the body like an animal hide. Whites were paid for these "red skins" as well as for other body parts, including fetuses. Do you still have mixed feelings?|`|BKyFxjeBaa	Personally, and tribally there are FAR MORE IMPORTANT THINGS, THEN MASCOTS to worry about.<br>  Namely making sure my elders have enough food and firewood to get through winter. Surviving, raising my own kids. Mascots are way way low on the list of things.<br>  <br>  A good example is Florida state and their deal with the Seminole nation. They did it right, the Tribe has given them their blessing.<br>  <br>  Redskin came from the cinnabar or red ochre we used for sunblock. This term predates the bounty on SCALPS.<br>  <br>  Talk it over with the elders of your local tribe. Work it out, do it with honor and pride. Do it in a good way.|`|y8DLyE5raa	No, but it's too late.  We've already taken everything from them, including their dignity.  Now people are saying this is wrong, that's wrong.  If it's so damn wrong why did we do so many horrible things to them in the first place?|`|HPqCRBq8aa	That's a good question. I remember a few years back, people wanted the "Redskins" name removed because it was insulting to Native Americans. The name is still there. I have mixed feelings about this.|`|DHtCzpNUaa	No.|`|a7Zu52jFaa	Nope. I think it would be equally offensive to have a "Jew" or an "angry Irish" or "black guy eating chicken".<br>  Offensive, outdated stereotypes that only promote racism and separatism.
znt2s3sMaa	We will all be with God and Jesus.....how can we be anything BUT blissfully happy to just be in their presence?   We all try so hard to get close to God,and are sad when we don't feel close to Him...so think of what it will be like to actually be in the very presence of Him!  Wow!<br>  <br>  Only people who have accepted Jesus as their personal savior and repented of their sins will even be in Heaven.  If they worship Mary rather than Jesus, they will not be in Heaven at all.<br>  <br>  We are free in Christ....if a person's conscious does not allow them to eat meat, then they shouldn't do it, but if they're conscious tells them it is Ok to eat meat, then they can-that's what Paul says.<br>  <br>  We won't remember any of our old lives when we are in Heaven....all we will know is God!  So there won't be any different levels of happiness probably.|`|LCZChP7Maa	If you read the pages of your bible more closely, you'll discover that only a small number of people go to heaven - 144,000. The rest of mankind (a great crowd) spoken of at Revelation 7:9 have the hope of living forever on earth after Armageddon. (Matt 5:5, Psalms 37:10,11)|`|70OClBEQaa	if there is a heaven people like Buddah are defently in there|`|KmnbjZIdaa	The degree of happiness of those who go to heaven depends on how much they love God, the more the love the happier the person.
AA11120822	Clearly, these kinds of people keep gravitating toward religious institutions because that's where they find all the gullible people who are easily separated from their money.|`|332vXA6oaa	Very much. Jehovah's Witnesses are the only religious group that don't get paid a cent for preaching and teaching.the word of God. All the work we do is voluntary.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	No they simply invented tithes and remained the very wealthy people they are by using it!!|`|aWHvHIr1aa	Why would the money changers change religions to the one that just embarrassed and caused them to lose a great deal of money?  This type of reasoning seems more random based than logic based.<br>  <br>  The Temple was named after Herod.  The High Priest was chosen by Rome.  The currency of Israel was Roman currency.  And money changers didn't exist in Solomon's Temple.  These are facts.  <br>  <br>  Not to allow the currency used through out Israel (Roman currency) meant profit had to be involved.  There is nothing in the Tanach mandating the type of money needed in the Temple.  Therefore, the need to have money changers as the question demands is consistent with the Temple being named for Herod and the High Priest being named by Rome.<br>  <br>  Being they were making their money in the Temple, they would be well connected with those in charge of the Temple. Had they converted to televangelist, they would be considered "apostate."  Being labeled as "apostate" would mean the money changers would not be able to continue making their living off the Jewish people as allowed by the Temple Jewish leadership.  If those in charge of the Temple  hadn't authorized the use of money changers, money changers would not have been in Herod's Temple.<br>  <br>  Therefore, money changing would have been practiced to 70 AD  where it would have died or be transformed into another part of Jewish culture.  However, there would be no connection to Christianity as the question implies.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	Moneychangers were probably like the poor folks we see at local dirt mall flea markets, the equivilent of the little old lady selling "Jesus Loves You" home-made candles so she can meet her mortgage.  They were not raking in the dough like a televangelist who tells you how "a family on welfare just pledged money, so why don't you?"...probably even scamming the little old lady at the flea market.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Uhmmmm, let me see now, I think that would be the Obama people who want to take from those that earn and redistribute the wealth in the name of equality|`|DArAz67Caa	you ask some strange questions-----I'm beginning to believe that your intentions are nothing other than to mock true soldiers of the lord-----this has no place here----
G2tnn5yjaa	No, but this guy named Tut keeps trying to tell me that he wants to make a really big withdrawal from the bank where I work. I don't think he really understands compound interest.|`|dR9UyP6naa	Is this person trying a 419 on you?<br>  <br>  *419 is the nigerian scammers*|`|2SzYXPrHaa	Is that what they are trying to do?|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Uhhmmm, let me see now, I believe that would be thems spiritually speaking and axing Nigerians, would it not?|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	In the AFTERLIFE?  No, All my spam is in the "Here and Now!"
9DW9irIGaa	the gospel itself IS very attractive! it's self-righteous, pious, or hypocritical christians that are the turn-off. also just in general, nobody wants to be accountable to their creator anymore. nobody wants to admit that someone made them, and that Someone wants to know them personally.|`|oJxceG0Kaa	The problem does not rest with legalism, or accountability for rules broken, but with rationalization and relativism.  Just like what happened to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, people figure the rules were not written for them and even if they were, God will excuse them for one reason or another.  Either that or they simply do not believe that there are any rules.  Just like gravity, there are laws of nature which govern balance, order and just weights.|`|hj76FSKdaa	It would help if you could point to a study that shows athieism is actually growing in North America.  As far as I can see, this is not the case in the United States or Mexico -- although perhaps true to a small extent in Canada.<br>  <br>  There is no point is trying to explain a claim that is not true.  First, establish that it is true. Then we can work on explaining it.|`|1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	Because Christians are not witnesses in the power, love and character of our Lord Jesus Christ (Romans 8:29, Galatians 2:20).  Christians ought to be transformed to be like Jesus to manifest the love and power of Him to the world.  Then the world will take notice of us seriously.  God bless you.|`|70OClBEQaa	Atheism is in high demand because it actually HAS evidence to back up any answers to ANY questions|`|b2bMy1EAaa	As intelligence increases, religion of all kinds decreases. There is a direct correlation, it is well documented.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	You provide a dramatic example of why Christianity isn't going anywhere anytime soon.|`|WwCBomTMaa	I think Atheism is on the rise because of lack of faith. We are a part of the "prove it to me" generation. But I am not quite sure what proof they want? I had an experience in my life that "proved" God is real, so God is real to me and has entered my heart. <br>  <br>  Also, we are a part of the generation where few people actually want to take responsibility for their actions. They choose not to believe in God because that would mean they would have to give up their immoral actions or face eternal damnation.<br>  <br>  Surprisingly a lot of Atheists grew up as Christians. But because of the type of Christians they were around they got turned off of Christianity, and the belief of God. Satan will do anything to diminish our numbers, including infiltrating churches and spouting poison that some Christians buy into.|`|nw0fqXj9aa	The God hypothesis is a failed one. It's not just Christianity that is having issues. All one needs is a rational mindset and a small degree of education.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Just try reading a small sample of Christian postings on here!!!<br>  <br>  Intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted!! Eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more. Christians are the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more - but far worse whilst they demand freedom of religion they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them!!!<br>  <br>  These terrible human emotions and attitudes coupled with the repeated use of threats of hell and damnation are well recorded as the things driving people away from Christianity!!<br>  <br>  As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it things might change!!|`|AA10249608	You are correct it is today's youth who are growing into atheists,they see no God in Christmas,no ten commandments at courts,the battle is on to remove in God we trust from our money and they are being taught in school evolution as a "FACT"  when it is just a theory, <br>  Sad|`|WalnRzfGaa	its on the rise because people are becoming more educated while religion is becoming more intolerant of others.|`|TMb076n6aa	Ditto to Sam! Agreed1|`|XEBpv9gwaa	I don't think it has anything to do with legalism.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking more along the lines of how people used to be in community with each other more and we slipped into the me generation and people as a whole tend to remain pretty self involved and self important.  Why be a part of a religion if you aren't interested in being within community and think you have all the answers?<br>  <br>  I'm also thinking the politicization of conservative Christianity has resulted in its decline.  Not all of us Christians want to tell others what they should do with their bodies or in their bedrooms.   Many of us care more about serving others and ministering to the poor.  But we aren't as visible and its the stereotype that may be driving some away.
83zdE9rTaa	Oh, but you do understand it . Your reference to my "gaps".  (I guess it is like the proverbial law of what is usually called the 2nd law or catch all law of thermodynamics. -- nature cannot resist a vacuum.  BTW as you know I am a weird Christian. One who believes for sure that Atheists along with all the rest of us will go to Heaven. --- of course some of us will require a remedial class in "How to play well with others". -- I think you will be an instructor in one of those classes-- I really do. (Now I am embarrassed for saying that, but just had to -- chagrin.)|`|QaT680QHaa	Its hard for me to answer this one as I have a view about the Goddess/Gods (Divine Purpose is my term) that is so different from others.<br>  I dont honour my deities because they created anything<br>  I honour them because they are part of everything. They <br>  offer guidance when I ask. <br>  Consciousness-becoming more in tune with the Earth and <br>  all of life force can lead you to a higher plane of consciousness<br>  Im still on a very low level so I really cant explain it I jsut follow<br>  my heart. People around me consider this wonky but it is truly working for me.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	If there is no Mithra, how do you explain why we have a conscience and a moral compass?<br>  <br>  "I am against religion because it makes us content with not understanding the world."-Richard Dawkins|`|yoPNXiluaa	I never said that.  Not even your paraphrase version.  I have never said that my version is better.  By the way, did you know that there is similarities in the creation story or myth, that is unverisal. Even in places that had no contact with each other.  There is a flood story almost everywhere.<br>  <br>  I believe in God, but i have never said what God is, so I can't say what God can do or not do, I can only speculate.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	I dont see that I can enlighten someone whos intelligence has far surpassed mine.|`|533z6lWpaa	I have never said that my God was best, because I do believe that is ignorant. I do believe He is the best, but I can understand why people deviate from Him.<br>  <br>  I can't speak for all Christian; I don't want to attempt to.<br>  <br>  But here is why I follow God:<br>  1. He loves us, but He does not demand that love.<br>  2. He sent His Son to teach us how to live, not to just hope for a better life beyond the grave.<br>  3. Jesus did not come for political domination.<br>  4. Jesus practiced what He preached.<br>  5. He died and rose from the grave.<br>  <br>  Those are my simple reasons. I didn't talk to you like you were really stupid, because I know you aren't. :)<br>  <br>  I don't know what others will answer, but that is my response.<br>  <br>  I hope you have an uber-fabulous day!|`|YUAegpPoaa	There is no short answer really but I think people have a hard time sorting out science, metaphysics, and religion and are partially arguing about where to draw any lines between them. If I have to compare and contrast all the possibilities I think you will lose either patience or interest if Y!A doesn't go down and lose my answer first. :)<br>  <br>  I know Buzz had not made it out of the box yet and does not ship with batteries so I can rule him out.<br>  <br>  There are still gaps even when you believe in God; you know that right? The questions you cite are just the reverse of  "Since I can think of this bad thing God must not exist. The (insert religious text name here) makes no sense to me when it says _____ so I have proved religion false. " that I also read over and over.<br>  <br>  If you determine there's something there as a cause for a particular whatever you feel compelled to look around and see if you can find what it is. That is how science works for me too - but I have to try other methods when science does not apply itself well, if at all.<br>  <br>  Are you specifically asking after empathy, morals, the beginning of everything or just why the question/why the answer?

Also, there can only be one omnipotent force, so this creator has no competition.  Finally, I want this creator to love me, which really ups my self esteem, and (why not?) have him look like me to send my self worth right over the top.  Now that we've established what this creator and ruler must be like, that's what God of the Bible must be like, because that's what my parents taught me to believe (regardless of whether the Bible actually corresponds).|`|aMrVslQkaa	It's a spiritual thing. I, personally, don't say "I don't understand it so it must be [insert whatever here]." But I do know, from being a former atheist to becoming a Catholic, that all it has to do with is faith, not stupidity. Yes, many people are uneducated about their own religion (and I wish they would educate themselves better!) but that doesn't mean they don't have faith. I can tell you from experience that it doesn't make sense until you feel that faith, so sorry the explanation can't be any better. The only thing I can relate it to that you might understand is science. Science is based on theories, not facts (been told that by many scientists, most of them atheist).  So when you sit down on a chair, you have faith that you won't float away from lack of gravity. It's the same thing, basically. Science is your faith, Catholicism is mine. That's not to say I believe science is bullcrap, because it's not and it's done (and is continuing to do) many great things for us. It's also done bad things (like nuclear weapons). The same goes for religion. Good things=Mother Teresa, people helping the poor, morals, values, etc. Bad things=people uneducated about their religion and using it as a tool for discrimination. So, like everything, the good comes with the bad. When a scientist doesn't understand something, they say, "I will do an experiment and my theory may or may not work out." And religious people say, "I will pray and may or may not get my answer."

According to your theory, he would have been perfect if he had been programmed like a machine to obey without mistakes.

FGcwxZz0aa	In first century Jerusalem there were at least four OT Canons in use by different Jewish Groups. There was the Canon of the Pharisees, the Sadducees, the Ethiopian Jews and the Diaspora/Essene Jews. Jesus and the disciples used the Septuagint which was the Canon of the Diaspora/Essenes. We know this because it is quoted in the New Testament. This Canon continued to be the Canon of Christians until after the Reformation and, in fact until about 200 years ago when the Protestants adopted a condensed version of the Canon eliminating the Deuterocanonicals from their Bibles. Even the AKJ originally contained the complete Christian Canon. It has been said by critics of Christ’s Church that the Deuterocanonicals were never believed to be inspired and just the opposite is true. The decision by Christians as to which books are inspired and useful for teaching was decided at the African Synods in the late fourth and early fifth century. There was never a question about their inspiration. <br>  <br>  The OT Canon chosen by the Protestants is actually a Jewish Canon not chosen by the Jews until after the establishment of Christianity as a result of the spread of Christianity to slow the growth of the new group in Jerusalem after the fall of the Temple in 70AD. Until then as I said previously there were many Canons in use. The adoption of the Canon missing the Deuterocanonicals united the Jews against the Christians was decided in the Jewish Council of Jamnia because the Deuterocanonicals referred too strongly to the Messiah fulfilled in Christ. <br>  <br>  Some Protestants will claim that only the Jews have the authority to choose Canon but the Church deferred that decision to Christ and the disciples and it is clear through biblical research, that the Septuagint is the Bible used by the first century Church and quoted in the NT Scriptures. The fact that Protestants choose to adopt the Canon that was approved by the same Jews that accused our Lord that resulted in His crucifixion suggests the source of this confusion as from the father of lies who led the Pharisees to accuse Christ and petition for His punishment. It is another way that Satan divides the body of Christ and separates the faithful denying Christ’s prayer that we all be one in Christ through His Church. The Christian Church has always used the Septuagint as Canon and never the truncated version of modernist Protestants.<br>  <br>  Some Protestants erroneously believe that Catholics added to the Bible with the Deuterocanonicals but this shows an ignorance of their own history and the history of Christianity as witnessed by Christ’s Church. The facts are that the Protestants removed the Deuterocanonicals and even considered strongly to remove some of the NT books currently in use by Protestants and Catholics. Fr. Martin Luther was in favor of removing the book of James because it conflicted with His heretical man made doctrines of the “Solas”, Sola Scriptura and Sola Fide. The heretic Ulrich Zwingli wanted to remove the Gospel of John because of its teaching of the commandment to Eat Christ’s Body and drink His Blood which contradicted his view of a real absence of Christ instead of a real presence in the Eucharist. Even Fr. Martin Luther could not endorse such a departure from Scriptures and deny that Christ is truly and really present in the Eucharist in Body, Blood, Soul and Divinity. <br>  <br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|PZKmZ95Yaa	The canon of the Old Testament that Catholics use is based on the text used by Alexandrian Jews, a version known as the "Septuagint" and which came into being around 280 B.C. as a translation of then existing texts from Hebrew into Greek by 72 Jewish scribes.<br>  <br>  The most striking difference between the Catholic and Protestant Bibles is the presence in the former of a number of writings which are wanting in the latter and also in the Hebrew Bible, which became the Old Testament of Protestantism. These number seven books: Tobias , Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, I and II Machabees, and three documents added to protocanonical books, the supplement to Esther, the Canticle of the Three Youths (Song of the Three Children) in Daniel, and the stories of Susanna and the Elders and Bel and the Dragon, forming the closing chapters of the Catholic version of that book. Of these works, Tobias and Judith were written originally in Aramaic, perhaps in Hebrew; Baruch and I Machabees in Hebrew, while Wisdom and II Machabees were certainly composed in Greek. The probabilities favour Hebrew as the original language of the addition to Esther, and Greek for the enlargements of Daniel. <br>  <br>  The history of Alexandrian and Palestinian Jews is where the differences are.This is where<br>  there is a smaller, or incomplete, and larger, or complete, Old Testament. <br>  <br>  The Old Testament canon of Scripture is that of the Septuagint, which was the Bible of the apostles. Other Christian communions through the years have deviated somewhat from this apostolic canon which the Orthodox Church still uses. The canon of the New Testament was developed over the early centuries of the Church. Its first known listing in its final form is the Paschal Letter of St. Athanasius of Alexandria in A.D. 367.<br>  <br>  The first major figure to codify the Biblical canon was Origen of Alexandria.|`|yQNit56Qaa	There's lots of misinformation in these answers.  Unfortunately, even some of the answers with extensive correct information include significant errors.<br>  <br>  The first problem is with your question, "were they there from the beginning".  Let's bypass that and go right to, "The argument seems to be over whether Catholics added the books, or whether Protestants removed them."<br>  <br>  <br>  First, let's define "bible".  I will use a very "loose" definition so that we can avoid detailed explanations.  Let's define "the bible" as<br>  a) a collection of religious documents<br>  b) this collection is bound under a single cover<br>  c) this collection contains, at the very least, all of the New Testament Scriptures and all of the Scriptures included in the Hebrew Bible.<br>  <br>  Now, using this as our definition, the very first bibles of which we are aware are the Greek codices of the 4th century - Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus.  The problem here is that these early Greek codices did not all contain the same content.  For example, Vaticanus did not include 1 & 2 Maccabees.  Sinaiticus includes additional Scriptures in the New Testament not include in Vaticanus or in modern bibles.<br>  <br>  In the late 4th century, councils of leaders of the early Christian church were convened to address this issue.  This issue was NOT addressed at the council of Nicea<br>  <a href="http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/nicaea.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tertullian.org/rpearse/nicaea...</a><br>  The first council that provided a list of Scriptures with a New Testament identical to our own was the synod of Hippo, 393 C.E.  This list was approved by the larger council of Carthage in 397 C.E.  You can see the list here<br>  <a href="http://www.bible-researcher.com/carthage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-researcher.com/carthage...</a><br>  <br>  To summarize:  the Hippo/Carthage list (known as a "biblical canon" or just "canon") is identical with the modern Roman Catholic canon **except** that the book of Baruch is not included.<br>  <br>  When the Latin Vulgate - the first book actually called "the bible" - was produced about the year 405 C.E., it followed this Hippo/Carthage canon (let's call it the HCc).  This is verified by our oldest complete Latin Vulgate, the 8th century Codex Amiatinus.<br>  <a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04081a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04081a.h...</a><br>  (4th paragraph beginning "The codex..." mentions that the book of Baruch is not present).<br>  <br>  The Decretum Gelasianum, a late 5th or early 6th century document, lists not only authorized Scriptures but also very many that were deemed to be unauthentic.  Once again, this agrees with the HCc and does not mention the book of Baruch either in the "authorized" list or the "unauthorized" list.<br>  <a href="http://www.ntcanon.org/Decretum_Gelasianum.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntcanon.org/Decretum_Gelasian...</a><br>  <br>  SO, we have every reason to believe that Christian bibles, in general, followed the HCc from 397 C.E. at least until the 8th century (the time of Codex Amiatinus).<br>  <br>  When Luther published his bible, he DID NOT remove any Scriptures from that bible.  Rather, those Old Testament Scriptures not found in the Hebrew Bible were separated into a section titled "Apocrypha".  SO, Luther DID NOT remove these Scriptures from the bible - not even in his final edition which was not published until after his death.<br>  <br>  However, Luther's first bible (1534) *did* include the book of Baruch.  Some time during the period between the 8th century and the 16th, the book of Baruch became a standard part of the Western bible.  I have been unable to determine exactly when or how this happened.<br>  <br>  It is important for this discussion to note that Luther wrote that the Scriptures of his Apocrypha were not inspired and therefore not worthy for the formation of Christian doctrine.  He wrote the same of Esther, James, Revelation and other Scriptures!  However, he did not separate *those* Scriptures from the rest of his bible.  We see from this that Luther separated the Scriptures of the Apocrypha into their own section solely do to the fact that they do not appear in the Hebrew Bible (or, alternately, that they were not known in Hebrew in Luther's time).<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_apocrypha#The_Luther_Bible" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_ap...</a><br>  <br>  The 39 articles of the Church of England of 1563 defined what Scriptures should be included in the English bible.  This list not only includes the Luther/Roman Catholic canon, but also the books of 1 & 2 Esdras.  Look at article VI here<br>  <a href="http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty...</a><br>  Notice that, in agreement with Luther, the Church of England identified the Apocrypha as containing Scriptures not worthy for the formation of doctrine but still useful for study.<br>  <br>  The Roman Catholic Church in 1564 authorized the decisions of the council of Trent.  This established a biblical canon that, like Luther's, included Baruch but omitted 1 & 2 Esdras.  However, the council of Trent asserted that all of these Scriptures were inspired, and Roman Catholic bibles never separate those Scriptures into a section titled "Apocrypha".  HOWEVER, the pope of the time insisted that 1 & 2 Esdras continue to be included in bibles simply for the sake of their preservation.  Therefore, 1 & 2 Esdras and the Prayer of Manasseh have come to be known as the Roman Catholic Apocrypha.  These 3 Scriptures were included in an appendix to all Roman Catholic bibles for about the next 2 centuries, but then (in the mid-1700s) Roman Catholic bibles began omitting them.<br>  <br>  The Anglican Communion - which includes the Church of England - continues to include readings from the English Protestant Apocrypha in their standard religious services and in their "Common Book of Prayer".  Thus, for the very numerous Anglican Communion, the Apocrypha remains an important, though uninspired, part of their bible.<br>  <br>  According to the HarperCollins Bible Dictionary, the first group - in any language - to omit the Scriptures of the Apocrypha from bibles were the Puritans in the late 1590s.  This practice caught on among other sects and in other languages after that time.<br>  <br>  In response to the Puritan practice, officials in England passed a law in the early 1600s prohibiting the production of a bible without the Apocrypha.  This is why you will be *very* hard-pressed to locate an English edition of the bible prior to 1800 that does not include the English Protestant Apocrypha.  Of course, there *were* some - the Puritans, for example, did not just give up on producing bibles without the Apocrypha.  Still, as I said, you will find it very difficult to find an English bible prior to 1800 that does not include the Apocrypha.<br>  <br>  Bibles that include the Apocrypha include the King James Version (here's the first edition table of contents)<br>  <a href="http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/printedbooksNew/index.cfm?TextID=kjbible&PagePosition=36" rel="nofollow">http://dewey.library.upenn.edu/sceti/pri...</a><br>  <br>  and the King James "Standard Text" produced in 1769.

I wonder how many Roman Catholics and Protestants are aware of the vastly greater differences between their Bibles and the Orthodox Bibles.|`|hvNqywbBaa	While all Christian Bibles have the same number of New Testament books, they do differ on the number of books found in the Old Testament. <br>  <br>  A Catholic Bible has 46 books in the Old Testament versus 39 in a Protestant Bible. The Catholic Church regards as part of the Bible the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus (Sirach), Baruch, 1 and 2 Maccabees, as well as some additional stories and verses in the books of Daniel and Esther. Catholics refer to these seven books as the “deuterocanonical” books, meaning the “second” standard books. Protestants refer to them as the “apocryphal,” or “hidden,” books. <br>  <br>  The roots of this discrepancy go back more than 2,000 years, when Judaism was still developing. One of the results of the foreign invasions of Palestine in the first millennium before Christ was the dispersion of Jews throughout the Mediterranean basin. Some of the displaced Jews formed a community in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, while others remained in Palestine. When deciding which books should be included in their scriptures, the Palestinian Jews identified the following conditions: The book must have been written in Hebrew; it must have been written in the region of Palestine; and it must not have been written after Ezra, approximately the year 250 B.C.<br>  <br>  The Alexandrian Jews, however, translated their Bible, our Old Testament, from the original Hebrew into Greek because that was the language they spoke. This translation, written sometime between the third and first centuries B.C., is called the Septuagint. They also included some “extra” books and verses that did not meet the Palestinian conditions: For example, the books of Maccabees and Wisdom were written around the year 100 B.C.; the book of Tobit was written in Aramaic; and chapters 13 and 14 of Daniel have been preserved only in Greek. <br>  <br>  By the end of the first century A.D. the Jews had officially chosen the Palestinian collection over the Alexandrian one. Christians, on the other hand, used the Septuagint as their Bible and eventually chose the Alexandrian over the Palestinian. <br>  <br>  Early church councils of the fourth century list the deuterocanonical books as part of the Christian Bible. Centuries later, in response to Martin Luther’s rejection of them, the Catholic Church’s Council of Trent in 1546 officially recognized the deuterocanonical books and verses as belonging to the Old Testament. The Protestant churches rejected these books because they seemed to support certain Catholic beliefs with which the Protestants disagreed, such as purgatory and prayers for the dead. Thus, the Protestant churches decided to follow the Palestinian canon instead of the Alexandrian (Septuagint), which is why Catholics and Protestants to this day do not read from the same Bible—or at least the same Old Testament.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	Here's a great article that might help answer your question:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://catholiceducation.org/articles/apologetics/ap0120.html" rel="nofollow">http://catholiceducation.org/articles/ap...</a><br>  <br>  The 7 books in question have always been in the Christian bible since the beginning.

Dr. Milo Gates, vicar of the Protestant Episcopal Church of the Intercession, in New York City, told why he deplored the "mutilation" of the Bible by the elimination of those books called "Apocrypha." Let me read you part of what he said:<br>  <br>  "Up to the time when a small but very noisy block of Scottish Presbyterians began their agitation in the British and Foreign Bible Society for the omission of these books every Bible had them. In fact every Bible had them until about 1826. In that year a Bible publishing society – the British and Foreign – voted to drop them. Immediately the English Bible Society threw out these books the Continental Bible societies ceased to work with them. Today the Apocrypha are in the Bibles of all the great churches – the Orthodox, Roman, Lutheran, Anglican and the Episcopal. We appeal for an unmutilated Bible in the interest of Christian unity."<br>  <br>  "In the second place, no one can really understand the New Testament without knowledge of these books. There are more than 111 quotations and allusions to the Apocrypha in the New Testament.<br>  <br>  "In the third place, some of the most blessed doctrines of the Church come from these books, and others we find developing in these books" (New York Times, Dec. 10, 1928).<br>  <br>  To list as "apocrypha," not genuine, seven Septuagint Old Testament Books, of which "more than 111 quotations and allusions" are recorded in the Protestant New Testament as having been used by Christ and the Apostles is an offense, though not so intended by the Protestants of our day and generation.<br>  <br>  One of the reasons given by Protestant churches for rejecting the seven books, is that doubts as to their authenticity were expressed in the early Church. But so were doubts expressed regarding the Epistles of St. Jude, St. James, 2nd and 3rd St. John, St. Paul’s Epistle to the Hebrews, and the Book of Revelation, until the Catholic Church made her canon of Scripture in the Council of Carthage (397 A.D.). <br>  <br>  It is interesting to note that Protestant churches do not include any books in their New Testament that the Catholic Church rejected.<br>  <br>  (((Korban))) Makes a great point. The Jews only rejected books after Christianity began to grow. <br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|z74a7wvlaa	To add on:<br>  a] The source of catholic OT is the Septuagint which was used at the time of Jesus and authorized about 300 BC. Septuagint includes 7 apocrypahl books [even more than that]. The Septuagint OT version was thus consolidated to the New Testaments somewhere in 400 ad and thus the catholic bible-Latin Vulgate by St Jerome.<br>   b] The christians eventually brokeaway from the rabbinical Jews. Due to the fighting of christians and Jews, and strengthening of christianity, the jews felt the need to cannonize their own bible; thus in Jamnia in 90 AD. Some QA writers have already mention that the Jews have recognized only the 39 books. They are jewish books. <br>  c] The protestants adopted the Jewish OT version; for some reasons, however their earlier version also includes the 7 apocryphal books. <br>  d] Conclusion: When the protestants came in 1500, they have the complete books including the 7 apocryphal; as time goes by, they eventually drop the 7 books as it against their anti-purgatory stand, anti-Icon veneration, etc. So, nowadays they are w/out the 7 books and still accuse the catholics of including the 7 books.|`|vMf7pL9Aaa	In order to understand Christian Bibles, it is first necessary to take a look at the Jewish Bible. It is divided into three sections: the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. The Law consists of the five books of Moses (Genesis to Deuteronomy). These formed the core of the canon. "Canon" is a Greek word meaning "reed," "measuring rod." The Law, therefore, was the canon, the measuring rod by which all later works were judged for correctness. The next Jewish division of the OT (Old Testament) is the prophets. This section contains books written by prophets like Isaias, Jeremias, etc., and books telling about the activities of prophets, such as the books of Kings. The last division of the OT is the Writings, a quite diversified group, for example, Psalms, Proverbs, Ruth and the apocalyptic work of Daniel. As centuries went by, the number of books in the Writings increased.<br>  <br>  The Septuagint (from the Greek meaning "seventy") is a Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, as well as other Jewish religious writings that are no longer part of the present-day Hebrew Bible. The Septuagint (abbreviated by its Roman numerals LXX) is the work of many translators. It was produced in the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. for Greek-speaking Jews. The LXX has more books in the section known as the Writings than the modern Hebrew Bible.<br>  <br>  Strictly speaking, there was no "Bible" then as we have it today. The canon wasn't closed or fixed during Jesus' lifetime. There was no authoritative list. Any scholarly, objective approach to the NT (New Testament) substantiates numerous parallels to the "extra" books contained in the LXX. The earliest Apostolic Fathers freely quote from the whole of the LXX as being inspired.<br>  <br>  From A.D. 90 onward, Christian writers explicitly quote from the "extra" books of the LXX. When the NT quotes the OT, 85 of the time it is from the LXX. But in the 2nd century, as Christians debated with Jews trying to convert them, they needed to meet them on their own ground, i.e. the Hebrew canon. As certain Church Fathers stopped using the "extra" books in debates, some Christians came to doubt their inspiration. However, facts show that when these same Church Fathers taught in their own circles, they employed the full LXX. The Septuagint was accepted as the official and inspired version of the OT because of its long-standing and consistent use by the Apostles and their disciples. In 393 St. Augustine and the Council of Hippo approved the list of books as contained in the present Catholic Bible. This was likewise ratified at Carthage in 397 and 419 and by the church practices of Rome.<br>  <br>  The early Christian Church was Greek-speaking; it therefore used the LXX. Even though the LXX sometimes gave different readings from the original Hebrew and had "extra" books interspersed with the rest, the early Church believed it to be inspired. "With regard to whatever is in the Septuagint that is not in the Hebrew manuscripts, we can say that the one Spirit wished to say to them through the writers of the former rather than through the latter in order to show that both the one and the other were inspired" (St. Augustine, City of God, 18:43). Hence the Orthodox Church uses only the LXX and not the original Hebrew as the official inspired OT. The LXX, compared to the Hebrew Bible, has the following additional books: Tobit, Judith, Wisdom of Solomon, Sirach, Baruch (including the Letter of Jeremias), 1-3 Machabees, Prayer of Manasseh, Psalm 151, 1 Esdras, additions to Esther and Daniel, and very rarely, 4 Machabees since it was not widely available and was never considered inspired. Since the Christians in the West spoke Latin, they translated the Bible into Latin, beginning about A.D. 150. But this was first of all done from the LXX, not the Hebrew. It wasn't until the end of the 4th century that St. Jerome made a translation from the Hebrew. It was then that he discovered that the Jews had a different Bible. Believing that Jesus never used anything other that the Hebrew Bible, Jerome wished to adopt their canon. Modern historical studies have shown, however, that the Jews did in fact have these other books and read them during Christ's time. Jerome was merely ill-informed, and the Tradition of the Church prevailed. Hence the Latin Bible (known as the Vulgate) contained the same books as the LXX. Increasingly, copies of the Latin Bible dropped out 1 Esdras, 3 Machabees, the Prayer of Manasseh, and Psalm 151. Consequently, when the Catholic Church responded to Protestantism at the Council of Trent, the Latin Vulgate that was made official on April 8, 1546, did not include these four works. Protestantism, initiated by Martin Luther, accepted the Jewish canon. Like Jerome, believing that Jesus used only the Hebrew Bible, Luther excluded the additional books found in the LXX. He also rejected the role of oral tradition as being equally authoritative with Scripture. Hence he questioned the Church's right to say which books were|`|HMteUyRdaa	The Holy Bible Douay-Rheims Version <br>  <br>  With Challoner Revisions 1749-52<br>  1899 Edition of the John Murphy Company<br>  <br>  IMPRIMATUR: <br>  James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, September 1, 1899.<br>  <br>  Pope Damasus assembled the first list of books of the Bible at the Roman Council in 382 A.D. He commissioned St.  Jerome to translate the original Greek and Hebrew texts into Latin, which became known as the Latin Vulgate Bible and was declared by the Church to be the only authentic and official version, in 1546. <br>  <br>  The DR New Testament was first published by the English College at Rheims in 1582 A.D.  The DR Old Testament was first published by the English College at Douay in 1609 A.D.  The first King James Version was not published until 1611.  This online DRV contains all 73 books, including the seven Deutero-Canonical books (erroneously called Apocrypha by Protestants).  These seven books were included in the 1611 KJV, but not in later KJV Bibles.  <br>  <br>  St. Jerome considered the seven Deutero-Canonical books to be NOT inspired by God, but he was commissioned by Pope Damasus to translate all 73 books into Latin. Pope Damasus considered the 7 DC books to be inspired by God. Later in 1946, after the finding of the dead-sea scrolls, it was discovered that these 7 DC books were used by the Jews in Alexandria, even in their services. This verifies that Pope Damasus was correct. <br>  <br>  It is interesting to note that the Palestinian Jews did not accept the 7 DC books for their version of Holy Scriptures and neither did they accept any of the New Testament. Unfortunately, the Protestants base their Bible on this version which comes from a people who did not accept Jesus Christ as the Messiah. <br>  <br>  The whole Douay-Rheims Bible was revised and diligently compared with the Latin Vulgate by Bishop Richard Challoner in 1749-1752 A.D.  The notes included in the text were written by Dr. Challoner. <br>  <br>  The DR Bible was photographically reproduced from the 1899 edition of the John Murphy Company, Baltimore, Maryland, by Tan Books in 1971.  Eventually, this edition was optically scanned to produce a large text file which this publisher used for creating this website, with the aid of text-processing software. <br>  <br>  One important goal of this project was to preserve the original text "as is", without making any changes in the wording, because the original text had the Imprimatur of James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, dated Sept 1st 1899.  <br>  <br>  The text file was checked quite thoroughly by software written by the publisher for punctuation errors and verses out of order.  The index was humanly checked for misspelled words and the corrections were made to the text.  However, some spelling errors may still be present in the text.  Many verses were out of order in the original file.  These have been corrected.  <br>  <br>  Every effort was made to ensure that this online version is an exact match to the original printed version.  No words were added or ommitted from the text, except for correcting errors caused by the scanning process.  No words were rearranged.  No verse numbers were changed, except in the case of Psalm 9.  <br>  <br>  Psalm 9 originally contained 21 verses and there were 2 versions of Psalm 10, numbering 1-18 and 1-8.  This obviously caused a conflict, so it was decided to put the first Psalm 10 in the last part of Psalm 9 and renumber the verses 22-39.  Thus, I retained the same numbering for all the Psalms as all the Douay Rheims Bibles. Note, in the Protestant Bibles the numbering of Psalms 10 through 146 differs by one. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://drbo.org/intro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://drbo.org/intro.htm</a><br>  <br>  Love<br>  Kate|`|ZAT8yqaGaa	There are Jewish comuites in Ethopia that use these books as scripture so some Jews did use them as scripture at the time the septuagent was transalted.

DTog0VZWaa	I don't feel like sorting through your quote & finding the error in your logic (again for your endless efforts today), but here's the gist of the whole thing.  Any of these links below can help you find the error in the specific quote's logic.<br>  <br>  I really wonder about your spirituality.  Why is it so shallow, that it matters to you to beat up on Jews about not being Christian?  You really think after 2000 years of hearing all this, that you've going to finally uncover how Judaism isn't what is it?<br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...<br>  <br>  In short here are the reasons Jesus is irrelevant to Judasim (he isn't mentioned, isn't a teacher, or rabbi, nor prophet):<br>   <br>  - There is a list of expectations of the messiah (someone else has it & I'm sure will post it). Jesus didn't do any of them. He did miracles which is a sign of not-the-messiah.<br>   <br>  - the Jewish messiah concept is a human being who does things like bring peace with the help of God. The Christ concept of being saved from sin by human or human-God sacrifice is totally alien to Judaism & to the Jewish messiah concept.<br>   <br>  - The OT is not the same as the Jewish Tanakh. It's quite similar, however there are small changes throughout that result in support for Christian theology. All those predictions go away when you use the Tanakh & the in-context Jewish understandings of them.<br>   <br>  - Judaism in general is very different than Christianity in many ways. While a Christ concept is central to Christianity, the focus on it when looking at Judaism pretty much misses most everything there is of importance in Judaism.  Briefly, Tikkun Olam (focus on this world & repairing it), a steady dialog for over 4000 years of how to live THIS life morally based on Torah, a style of doing that dialog that isn't in Christianity but is central to being Jewish, a whole complicated list of wonderful religious days, a way of being just one religion amoung others where non-Jews too can have a place in the world to come.<br>   <br>  Hope that helps. This is the first question every Christian seems to ask us. If you do a search in YA you may find any number of posts with answers to this with more details.<br>   <br>  Here's a good starting point to learn about Judaism:<br>  <a href="http://www.jewfaq.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewfaq.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aish.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.aish.org</a> <br>  Written for jews to learn more about Judasim so gives a sense of how Judasm works (including that study style - the essays have that flow)<br>  <a href="http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatjewsbelieve.org</a> <br>  Answers common Christian questions<br>  <a href="http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966" rel="nofollow">http://www.jcrelations.net/en/?id=966</a> <br>  Cool interfaith site that gives a Christian view of Judaism by clerics<br>   <br>  The idea of "do unto others" was in Judaism before Jesus said it (the sage Hillel is famous for it & it's in Deut). So Jesus basically didn't bring anything morally that is new to Judaism, & left out some stuff. So, there's no need from that point of view to adopt him either.<br>  <br>  Finally, there are a few sites & sources that really go into this. They aren't necessarily written PC style, but do have details like Hebrew quotes:<br>  <a href="http://www.messiahtruth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.messiahtruth.org</a><br>  <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tx5qrKz6dRMC&pg=PA91&lpg=PA91&dq=Isaiah+7+Jewish&source=web&ots=Eg_DtfmPv0&sig=Xgkfmo1coQ87FunhOtDWYJz1xn0&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=8&ct=result#PPP1,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tx5qr...</a><br>   <br>  =====<br>  As for any messanics that answer.

Daniel was not written exactly 490 years before the fall of the temple, or the 40 years prior when Jesus died, or the 30 years prior to that when he was born.  Who told you that it was?<br>  <br>  It was probably closer to 532 BC, when the Jews returned to their land at the behest of the "Son of God, Cyrus" (Cyrus' dates are 530-529 BC) and were told to build their temple, but even taking your date of 444, that still leaves a good 25 years off the mark...if you're going to tell a fib, you should do the math and at least claim that Artaxerxes or Darius the II was in charge of the decree, because at least that way the math works out closer.  Of course, that leaves a contradiction in the Bible since it clearly states that Cyrus decreed this, but somehow I think you're the type to conveniently ignore contradictions.  Still, you're a good 50 to 130 years off by most accounts, unless you want to continue manipulating the "start date" until it fits (something you prophecy proponents are incredibly accurate at doing - a lot moreso than your prophets)...besides the whole passage you quote was believed inserted during the time of the Maccabees to justify the over-throw of the Greek rulers at that time (and it fits!  how wonderful!)...see how manipulative the text can be?  Especially when your general populace is illiterate, and you can add things and then claim they were always there? Even to entice them to war?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  YOU: - "point is, as you can well see, the Messiah was supposed to come before the destruction of the temple. And he was supposed to die, which means that he has to come again."<br>  <br>  No, the point was, as your question clearly states about "the exact dates", of which I have clearly proved you wrong - even using your own information.  There is nothing remotely EXACT about your date.  Another question popped up on the same subject:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhaCS6huj70UIJOvdiRtGtPty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227231734AAso1td&show=7#profile-info-UVVce5hTaa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  You should read some of the responses, both pro and con - your "pro" advocates contradict each other - do you think God causes confusion amongst his followers?<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  One additional comment - I checked your verse against my husband's Bible (New American - Catholic) - it says that the term "weeks" is used, but that it somehow means years.  What I'm getting at is there seem to be some definate translation problems.  All scholars stress that the time table should not be taken literally (of course not, since it doesn't match up to anything).  Some scholars insist it is referencing the reconsecration of the Temple after Antiochus' desecration (the war against the Greek encroachment of the temple), while other's insist it refers to Jesus (though obviously not literally, and certainly not convincingly unless you are already pre-disposed to believing it).<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  I didn't say Daniel was written afterwards...not the entire book, just the passage used to help incite the Maccabees war.  Maybe our problem is that some of us prefer the serious study of the texts using archaelogical methods, literary criticism, and the opportunism of leaders in crisis to manipulate their populations, while you prefer the blind obedience of authoritarianism concerning the text as being "the word of God." <br>  <br>  The issue is not really where we start, but where we hope to end up.  I hope that people end up thinking for themselves, and can find a way to publicly debate our future on the sound basis of ethical justice, leaving behind the imaginary poetry of the Bible as absolutist dogma and seeing it for the literature it is, and what it was for the people that experienced it in their own historical and ethical growth.  It is not useless, as some would say, but simply a piece of our identity as a people - one that should be given no more or less status than any other contribution to our identity.<br>  <br>  I don't know you, but you strike me as a person who hopes we all end up riding white horses to heaven in the rapture, and that is a silly and naive hope for a people to have.  The superstitious has no place in our future, it needs to have it's place of rest in the long past of witches and vampires and fairies and wizards - instruments of the human imagination, but not of our reality.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Why "and I guess Jews"? anti-Semite NAZI!!|`|d8XND5ngaa	Quite simply, I don't.|`|LJlaHLQdaa	THE PROPHECY OF DAN. 8:14: "UNTO TWO THOUSAND AND THREE HUNDRED DAYS; THEN SHALL THE SANCTUARY BE CLEANSED." THAT A DAY IN SYMBOLIC PROPHECY REPRESENTS A YEAR, SEE NUM. 14:34; EZE. 4:6. AS THE PERIOD OF 2300 PROPHETIC DAYS, OR LITERAL YEARS, EXTENDED FAR BEYOND THE CLOSE OF THE JEWISH DISPENSATION, IT COULD NOT REFER TO THE SANCTUARY OF THAT DISPENSATION. MR. MILLER HELD THE GENERALLY RECEIVED VIEW THAT IN THE CHRISTIAN AGE THE EARTH IS THE SANCTUARY, AND HENCE CONCLUDED THAT THE CLEANSING OF THE SANCTUARY BROUGHT TO VIEW IN DAN. 8:14 REPRESENTED THE PURIFICATION OF THE EARTH BY FIRE AT THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST. THE POINT FROM WHICH TO RECKON THE 2300 DAYS IS FOUND IN DAN. 9:24-27, WHICH IS AN EXPLANATION OF THE VISION OF CHAPTER 8. IT IS STATED THAT 70 WEEKS, OR 490 YEARS, ARE DETERMINED, LITERALLY, CUT OFF, AS SPECIALLY PERTAINING TO THE JEWS. THE ONLY PERIOD FROM WHICH THE 70 WEEKS COULD BE CUT OFF IS THE 2300 DAYS, THAT BEING THE ONLY PERIOD OF TIME MENTIONED IN THE VISION OF CHAPTER 8. THE 70 WEEKS MUST THEREFORE BE A PART OF THE 2300 DAYS, AND THE TWO PERIODS MUST BEGIN TOGETHER. THE 70 WEEKS ARE DECLARED BY THE ANGEL TO DATE FROM THE GOING FORTH OF THE COMMANDMENT TO RESTORE AND BUILD JERUSALEM. IF, THEN, WE CAN CORRECTLY LOCATE THIS COMMANDMENT, WE HAVE THE STARTING-POINT FOR THE GREAT PERIOD OF THE 2300 DAYS. THE BIBLE FURNISHES US WITH FOUR TESTS BY WHICH WE MAY DETERMINE WHEN THE TRUE DATE IS FOUND:<br>  <br>       1. FROM THE TIME THE COMMANDMENT WAS GIVEN, 49 YEARS WERE TO WITNESS THE COMPLETION OF THE STREET AND WALL OF JERUSALEM. DAN. 9:25. <br>  <br>       2. THREESCORE AND TWO WEEKS FROM THIS TIME, OR, IN ALL, 69 WEEKS, 483 YEARS, WERE TO EXTEND TO MESSIAH THE PRINCE, OR TO THE ANOINTING OF CHRIST BY THE HOLY SPIRIT AT HIS BAPTISM, THE WORD MESSIAH SIGNIFYING ANOINTED. <br>  <br>       3. SIXTY-NINE AND A HALF WEEKS WERE TO EXTEND TO THE CRUCIFIXION,--THE CESSATION OF SACRIFICE AND OBLATION IN THE MIDST OF THE WEEK. VERSE 27. <br>  <br>       4. THE FULL PERIOD OF 70 WEEKS WAS TO WITNESS THE COMPLETE CONFIRMATION OF THE COVENANT WITH DANIEL'S PEOPLE. AT THE TERMINATION OF THIS PERIOD, THE JEWS HAVING CEASED TO BE GOD'S CHOSEN PEOPLE, THE GOSPEL WOULD BE PREACHED TO THE GENTILES. <br>  <br>       IN THE SEVENTH OF EZRA WE FIND THE DECREE WHICH WE SEEK. IT WAS ISSUED BY ARTAXERXES, KING OF PERSIA, B. C. 457. IN EZRA 6:14 THE HOUSE OF THE LORD AT JERUSALEM IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN BUILT "ACCORDING TO THE COMMANDMENT [MARGIN, DECREE] OF CYRUS, AND DARIUS, AND ARTAXERXES KING OF PERSIA." THE THREE KINGS DID THE ONE WORK; IT WAS BEGUN BY CYRUS, CARRIED FORWARD BY DARIUS, AND COMPLETED BY ARTAXERXES. THE SCRIPTURE COUNTS THIS ACTION ONE DECREE. THAT THE LATER DECREES WERE A CONTINUATION OR COMPLETION OF THAT OF CYRUS, SEE EZRA 6:1-14. TAKING B. C. 457 AS THE DATE OF THE COMMANDMENT, EVERY SPECIFICATION OF THE PROPHECY CONCERNING THE 70 WEEKS IS FULFILLED.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	People read the old testament and then wrote the new testament according to the old testament prophecies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it really that hard to come to that conclusion by yourself?|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Self-fulfilling prophecy!<br>  <br>  If someone says such and such will occur on a specific date, some nut out there will make sure it does.|`|czf6uhIraa	Oh boy.

Together they wrote a number of now standard rock-and-roll songs under assumed names, and Dr. X began helping Dobbs locate people to run what would become the public relations arm of the Church, The SubGenius Foundation.<br>  <br>  In 1972 "Bob" initiated telepathic contact with the then-down-and-out "Dr." Philo Drummond, and finally appeared to him in person in 1973. Philo recruited his friend Ivan Stang, a failed science fiction writer, to help generate the first Church brochures and propaganda booklets.<br>  <br>  The rest is history, at least to the I.R.S.<br>  <br>  So basically, this proves that the Bob HAD to come before the destruction of the second Millennium in 2001AD. <br>  <br>  Proves it, no doubt.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	Then how do you explain the fact Jesus failed to live up to the messianic prophecies?|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Besides Daniel being written after the events in question?|`|JUviY9hoaa	Uh huh.

Was he then establishing a ritual to be followed yearly? Not at all. This is evident from the fact that the Bible does not record any such practice among the early Christians. Lent was first observed in the fourth century after Christ. Like many other teachings of Christendom, it was borrowed from pagan sources.<br>  <br>  If Lent is in imitation of Jesus’ fasting in the wilderness after his baptism, why is it observed during the weeks leading up to Easter—supposedly the time of his resurrection? Jesus did not fast during the days prior to his death. The Gospel accounts indicate that he and his disciples visited homes and ate meals in Bethany just a few days before he died. And he ate the Passover meal the night before his death.—Matthew 26:6, 7; Luke 22:15; John 12:2.

The ‘Big Bang’ is excluded by this sequence (E.g. Earth before Sun). <br>  Man and the animals were created vegetarian (Genesis 1:29–30). No death and suffering in the original creation.<br>  <br>   The Koran says: <br>  Man was created in Paradise (‘janna’),1 not on Earth (first couple later banished to Earth, e.g. Koran 2:36).<br>  No clear details of each creation day. Some vague clustering of the days in 41:9–12.2 <br>  Carnivory (and thus death and suffering) apparently integral to life on the created Earth from the first.

There is new evidence for it everyday and nothing against it(except ancient religious scriptures).<br>  <br>  Also evolution hasn't just been created, and it definitely wasn't created to be biased against religion. It just is. Tough sh*t if it goes against creationism and 'God'.|`|NqxYL9aKaa	Not at all it's common sense something religion has lacked since it's creation, religion an organisation motivated  by greed and power by creating a myth that draws the hopeless, the poor, and the elderly that pays for religious wealth.|`|QQ2rTaPdaa	Its objective.

It is a THEORY. <br>  <br>  Just the thought of the earth forming from some "big bang" is ridiculous. It goes against all scientific reasoning. Where/ how did this stuff form that exploded? And created everything we see now? <br>  <br>  Think about all the intricate things around us (especially the human body- the brain, human gestation, DNA, human emotion and the chemicals related to them), and to think that this was all by accident? The probability of this is not even possible to comprehend. <br>  <br>  Science does not favor evolution. The basis of the laws of thermodynamics are totally against it. How could scientist even believe these laws and then say that everything is evolving for the better? <br>  <br>  Yes, I do think they favor atheism. I would even dare to say most "scientists" are atheist, because the evolutionary theory is nothing but everything happening by "accident", without a greater being intervening.|`|FCNAf6NTaa	Creationists will tell you that various things are "smoking guns" which disprove the theory of evolution (TOE).  Certain specific strata, the bacterial flagellum, and many others are trotted out again and again.  But scientists haven't changed their consensus that TOE is valid, useful, and predictive. Why is this?<br>  <br>  Even the most staunch creationist would agree that TOE has had a huge impact on our culture as well as on the work biologists do every day. They don't need to agree with it in order to acknowledge this - it's simply a fact. And I hope they would agree that anyone who toppled this sacred cow would be next in line for a Nobel prize and a place in the history books. <br>  <br>  This incentive is real, and even if there is some kind of mass conspiracy to keep the truth from the people it's unlikely that not a single person has decided to be the whistle blower and trade membership in a secret club for fame, riches, and notoriety. <br>  <br>  To the creationists here who post their reasons for the invalidity of TOE, reasons so simple they can be typed in two or three sentences, I have a simple question:<br>  <br>  If you have the smoking gun why haven't you published?  Just type it up and submit it to Nature. If your idea is so paridigm-shattering and it stands up to peer review you will never have to work a day again, and neither will your grandchildren. <br>  <br>  These people don't publish. And neither do the accredited scientists at the Discovery Institute. They admitted as much in the Dover trial - despite knowing the real scientific truth they had submitted exactly zero papers for review, instead getting their message across through websites aimed at laypeople. Why would they do this if they hold such a valuable piece of information?<br>  <br>  Why are they afraid to publish?<br>  <br>  The folks on YA don't publish because they're not scientists and have no understanding of what constitutes proof, evidence, or falsifiability. This lack of sophistication is also why they believe the propoganda. <br>  <br>  The scientists from the Discovery Institute, the ones who fill the people here and elsewhere with their nonsense, don't publish because they know they're lying. And they're doing it in the name of their god. <br>  <br>  Appalling, isn't it?|`|AA11606721	You ask this question as if you've never seen the objective evidence supporting evolution (and readily available to us all). Not having seen this evidence, why would you ask such a question unless you've been influenced by subjective opinion to the contrary? Because you've been influenced by contrary, subjective opinion, you are incapable of understanding the objective reality science has to offer.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question - no.....|`|z4Yeofq8aa	No. Scientists would be falling over themselves to try and disprove evolution if there were any viable evidence against it. Evolution occurs and there is just no evidence to suggest otherwise.|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	of course. but hey your an adult and are entitled to believe whatever you choose. I am a christian man and believe that evolution has its place in christianity just not necessarily how the scientist see it.|`|5eSJpYbMaa	Most people who accept evolution are Christians.

People judge each other all the time.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Everyone judges at times.|`|lbGVdgr1aa	No one judges them ?  Wow, are you for real ?<br>  <br>  Real Christians are not suppose to judge anyone.  However that does not mean that sinners are automatically accepted.  Sinners are accepted if they repent and sin no more.  You cannot be a Christian and declare that you live a sinner's lifestyle and wish to continue to live a sinner's lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Is this what you call judging ?  Because you cannot be accepted as a Christian unless you stop sinning ?|`|RyhluHk3aa	Scripture teaches two separate religions, which have separate gospels.<br>  <br>  Judaism is the teaching of the law, and has the Gospel of the Kingdom<br>  (the OT, the 4 Gospels, and the non-Pauline epistles)<br>  <br>  Christianity is the teaching of grace, and has the Gospel of the Grace of God. <br>  (the Pauline epistles)<br>  <br>  According to the Gospel of the Grace of God, Christians are taught to judge only those within the Body of Christ, and when a brother in Christ needs reproof, to correct him with love and meekness. A Christian is taught NOT to judge those outside of the Body of Christ, as it is the Father that judges those without.<br>  <br>  One who judges others misrepresents Christ, as they themselves are also sinners, saved only by the finished work of Christ on the cross.|`|AQ74jcKEaa	What one considers judging is simply conviction. To tell someone the truth of a matter sometimes interferes with their beliefs and look like someone is judging them when they are simply warning about the trouble that lies ahead.|`|79uzTFl7aa	Easy there.  Judging is meant to prohibit damning people to H-e-you know where.  Correcting mistakes is not necessarily judging.  You're welcome to disagree on whatever pronouncements people make of you, Christian or not.|`|Z1Gw6lVqaa	saying: you're a sinner and we're all sinners is NOT judging.<br>  <br>  saying: YOU'RE A STUPID IDIOT AND YOU DISGUST ME WITH YOUR LIFESTYLE, YOU'LL ALWAYS BE THAT WAY<br>  is judging.<br>  <br>  The first is trying to alert the person of their faults to help them<br>  <br>  the second is just putting the person down.<br>  <br>  apparently no one wants to hear about their own faults from anyone ever, they can just live in fantasy land, believing they are perfect....<br>  <br>  Again there is also a difference from casting the first stone, and alerting someone of their faults to help them. Too many people are on the defensive. <br>  <br>  I will definitly take constructive cristism, but put downs I will not stay around for....|`|cvp0SEBNaa	so you are saying if I see some man beating up a child i should not do anything  because some inbred atheist might think i am judging?<br>  <br>  dude get a life..|`|yzRHAWNhaa	What planet are you from? On earth Christians are constantly judged.|`|wSYYfBK4aa	Are you kidding?  I judge the hell out of them.|`|jHyzIHmCaa	I agree with "NotForogtten" People get the wrong idea about that verse.  Jesus said that we are to stand up to things that are immoral, we are too be bold against immorality. . . how can you stand against these things if you are afraid of society's idea of so called judging.  When jesus said judge not lest ye be judged that meant don't take vengeance on someone.  don't think you are the judge! Don't think you have not sinned and you deserve better than other people..Don't intentionally make someone feel less than you!!! If the case of judging was telling someone that they are doing wrong, then Jesus sinned as well!  This new idea is what culture made up! Not Jesus or the apostles, read the bible more carefully!  On another note , in pauls writings, how many times did he tell the people that what they were doing was wrong, how many times did moses tell the people that what they were doing was wrong, i can name many other examples....  what we are too look out for is hypocrites who put people down for their own image, not God fearing people who are bold to profess what is deemed right because they believe that your blood is on their soul if they don't  have the guts to speak up! Don't twist the words of scripture to justify your opinions when somebody offends you by telling you something that you don't want to hear.|`|lprYy9RGaa	Since God has dispensed judges to decide the fate of those breaking the laws that God sat down until now our system of laws is based on the Book Of The Law. Our interpretation is sometimes bad or not justified by God.<br>  Not every Christian out there judges others, that is not our function as many who do judge have something wrong with themselves and take it out on others. <br>  Call it "The Blame Game."<br>  As Jesus put it ..Be perfect as your Father in heaven IS perfect.<br>  Some have taken this scripture to the extreme, and some use it as a battering Ram to beat non-believers over their proverbial heads to convince them of the Truth when the Truth speaks, it Does Not Need a battering ram, rather a seeker who seeks after the Truth as one who thirsts seeks after water.|`|oCATmYDsaa	Christians go hand and hand with judging, because according to them whatever is wrong by their standards then your either going to hell, or your not accepted by them.|`|b1yr0KDEaa	Nobody judges them?!? - I judge 'em all the time!!!

First, there is not a shred of evidence that a 'God' (any of 'em, take your pick) exist. So by extension the mythology surrounding the 'God' also does not exist - so no hell. But lets be generous and suppose there is a God - what would you call a person who demanded constant praise, who demands everyone else follows a set of rules laid out by him/her without consultation upon those he/she is imposing the rules on, and who will send anyone who does not follow the dictated rules to an existence of never-ending torment? Well, you might call that person a dictator - or you may even call him/her quite, quite mad. Now that's a scary thought -  we may just have an insane God hanging over us.

44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Nessa,<br>  I also do not understand it.  I would personally like for some of those who believe this to tell me why the Bible says in Hebrews 10:25-26 (King James Version)  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching.  For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins...  Our FATHER expects each and every one of us to "work out our own salvation with fear and trembling" (Philippians 2:12) according to the scriptures also.  Why do they believe that only saying I believe in CHRIST is enough to fulfill these passages?  I am terribly worried that a number of them are going to meet CHRIST at the Judgment and HE may say, "I never knew you"  (Matthew 7:23).  Have a great week.<br>  Thanks,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  <br>  .|`|AA10182088	I can't speak for anyone else, but I believe that once I'm saved I've developed within my faith the knowledge of Christ and with that understand sin and repentance. I believe that I was saved through Grace not works and by repentance of wrongs I do, I'm understanding the sin and choosing to not repeat them.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Once saved is neither a theory nor theology..its a fact..the death and rising completed salvation ( sin) that leads to death (spiritually)Was stopped there is no death and where is thy sting.this sealed your fate in christ your sins are paid for,Past Present and future including repeated sins your destiny is paid for in full, there are no conditions in the payment made.and this is where you get full gospel..<br>  <br>    everything that is required on earth for us to be saved is finished in heaven.( forever o lord thy word is settled in heaven.)<br>    for Jesus asended to the father and came down to fulfill earthly assignments on earth for his followers and believers.|`|iMY2fgYdaa	hears how I see it....first only God truely knows ones heart, so if they have truely asked for salvation then he knows and only he knows if they hae repentented.....so its a bit to difficult for us to say who has or hasn't repented. But for those of us who can't see someones heart there actions should speak much louder then their words....in other words they should start producing fruits of the spirit.|`|tGgADx4Raa	It's Becouse after you are saved sin has nothing to do with getting to heaven. You will always be God child, but by sinning you put things between you and God and make it harder for you to have a close relationship with Him. The bible says once you are born again you get a temple in heaven, everything you do either puts hay and stubble or gold and silver in your temple. When we are judged your temple will be burned and the hay and stubble will be gone and what's left over is what we have to give as gifts to the Lord.<br>  <br>  So basicly sin makes you futher from God and puts bad stuff in your temple. It has nothing to do with going to heaven.|`|oJxceG0Kaa	They rely on the promise of God, "by grace you are saved and not of works lest any man should boast."  Since only God will be making the determination who is IN and who is OUT of heaven plus the fact that we would have no way of determining with absolutely accuracy what constitutes a sin and what would be sufficient repentance for it, most folks rely on God's promise of salvation.  There are such things as sins of omission - wrongdoing that people may not even be aware of that is hurting others, for example gossip.  Their faith has made them well, if in fact, they abide in faith.|`|aZvWDxqvaa	Salvation is based upon your true acceptance of Jesus as Lord and Savior. Just because one is saved does not make him or her perfect. It just makes them righteous in God's sight. But as a newly born Christian, just as a new born baby, we will do things wrong. This is a growing process called sanctification. During this time God is making corrections in your behavior in order to make you Christ like. This can not be done if your are constantly "jumping out of God's hand", if that is possible. You would always end back up being born again and again and again. <br>  <br>  By saying that, we still must ask for forgiveness as Christians in order that the sanctification process to continue. Your not kick out of your family anytime you mess up. The same is with God.|`|c695e3d842e5ce7f37359934a75d6b3caa	What the belief is<br>  <br>  is God's salvation is a gift to us, which it is.  He will not take it back.  Once we are saved we are saved.  But, He doesn't take it back, but we can give it up on our own.  Some once saved always saved believe they can do anythng they want and still get into heaven.  Not true.

Why? Because Jesus Christ took the penalty of our death upon Himself.<br>  So it seems that OSAS -- as you have so coined-- people believe that every sin has been forgiven. If you accept the gift of God, which is grace, you are justified and saved. (Note, we are all redeemed from sin, but still there will be many who are not saved).<br>  Doing a sin without asking for repentance, say suicide, is troublesome. I'm inclined to believe that if you are a Christian, you should not want to sin. So why would a true believer not repent? Also, why would a true believer commit suicide? I do not mean to judge anyone who has, but I am just really confused because of the Spirit's joy inside of me.|`|LCZChP7Maa	The bible says "he that has endured to the end is the one that will be saved."

The Wailing Wall will be rebuilt.Currently, Israel is clearing the area and preparing to do so.

The only country on earth that could single handedly  raise an army the size described in the bible, is China. China and Russia(Gog and Magog) appear to have a very close relationship with the US on the outside and could very easily invade Israel.

They've made my life better, so obviously you should follow them too, right?  If I accept them, it's clear what you should do too, huh?  (BTW, I don't believe that.  I have something called RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE.  You should try it.)<br>  <br>  Easy: I don't believe in him as a god.  While I like a lot of what he did, but his father is, according to the Bible, a genocidal maniac with no respect for life, even that of babies and small children.<br>  <br>  From the book of Revelations:<br>  <br>  # God gives someone on a white horse a bow and sends him out to conquer people. 6:2<br>  <br>  # God gave power to someone on a red horse "to take from the earth ... that they should kill one another." 6:4<br>  <br>  # God tells Death and Hell to kill one quarter of the earth's population with the sword, starvation, and "with the beasts of the earth." 6:8<br>  <br>  # The martyrs just can't wait until everyone else is slaughtered. God gives them a white robe and tells them to wait until he's done with his killing spree. 6:10-11<br>  <br>  # God tells his murderous angels to "hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of your God on their foreheads." This verse is one that Christians like to use to show God's loving concern for the environment. But the previous verse (7:2) makes it clear that it was their God-given job to "hurt the earth and the sea" just as soon as they finished their forehead marking job. 7:3<br>  <br>  # 144,000 Jews will be going to heaven; everyone else is going to hell. 7:4<br>  <br>  # Those that survive the great tribulation will get to wash their clothes in the blood of the lamb. 7:14<br>  <br>  # God sends his angels to destroy a third part of all the trees, grass, sea creature, mountains, sun, moon, starts, and water.   8:7-13<br>  <br>  # "Many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter." 8:11<br>  <br>  # The angels are instructed not to "hurt the grass [how could they? He already had all the grass killed in 8:7] ... but only those men which have not the seal of God on their foreheads." God tells his angels not to kill them, but rather torment them with scorpions for five months. Those tormented will want to die, but God won't let them. 9:4-6<br>  <br>  # God makes some horse-like locusts with human heads, women's hair, lion's teeth, and scorpion's tails. They sting people and hurt them for five months. 9:7-10<br>  <br>  # Four angels, with an army of 200 million, killed a third of the earth's population. 9:15-19<br>  <br>  # Anyone that messes with God's two olive trees and two candlesticks (God's witnesses) will be burned to death by fire that comes out of their mouths. 11:3-5<br>  <br>  # God's witnesses have special powers. They can shut up heaven so that it cannot rain, turn rivers into blood, and smite the earth with plagues "as often as they will." 11:6<br>  <br>  # After God's witnesses "have finished their testimony," they are  killed in a war with a beast from a bottomless pit. 11:7<br>  <br>  *****************************<br>  No way am I going to worship THAT!<br>  <br>  It's obvious you don't really want an answer.

Inserting windows adds time and work to the construction and they also add costs.<br>  <br>  We feel it is much more important to be out fulfilling the "Great Commission" to preach which Christ gave us rather than spending time and money on fancy buildings.<br>  <br>  As has been mentioned, another reason is vandalism in some populated areas.<br>  <br>  It also helps to identify the false Christians because they're the ones who spread lies and falsehoods even about such a little thing like not having windows.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|MSHxYrLEaa	hi<br>  <br>  that's an old lie, i have seen a few people try and tell others this<br>  <br>  but it is just not true, seeing as mine does, admittedly the back windows have bars on them which doesn't look pretty but that's to stop people breaking in (we had the sounds equipment nicked a few years ago)<br>  <br>  <br>  but a lot will depend on the area, or the layout of the building.<br>  <br>  the witnesses have nothing to hide whatsoever. the kingdom halls are actually a public place, if you want to go in then just walk right in when there is a meeting taking place|`|oen1tuyTaa	So they can molest the goats and sheep without being "witnessed"..<br>  Its actually not completely true, some Kingdom Halls do have windows...albeit obscured but nonetheless some do.|`|UITfm0fjaa	HAHHAHHAH!

wkWJzvakaa	Yes, and I'm christian. There are passages in the bible that supports this idea. Preadamite flood destroying everything, and the flood of Noah destroying mankind.<br>  <br>  It's widely acceptable that there's been a ~5,000 year time span from Adam to present. It's completely rediculous to believe that the heavens, and earth is only 5,000 years old. I don't see how anyone could believe that.<br>  <br>  “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.<br>  And the earth was [Heb. haja = had become] without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.” (Gen 1:1-2) <br>  <br>  In a nutshell, Genesis 1:1 is understood to be a time of the original creation of the universe. But verse 2 through to 2:1 is about the restoration of the earth in preparation for creation of man and subsequent events – so there would be considerable time between the two verses ~about 4 1/2 billion years or so.<br>  <br>  You think dinosaurs were roaming the earth while Adam and Eve were starting a family? You think the grand canyon was carved out in just 5,000 years, while now it's only dropping 1 foot every 1,000 years? You think meteor fragments that have been dated back 4 billion years or so, were less than 5,000 years old?<br>  <br>  IMO, the only way I could even justify the validity of the bible was to conclude there was a preadamite era. I've listened to preachers who do not believe in dinosaurs, and believe the fossils they uncover are fake.|`|pqveENjUaa	According to those wonderful books that the ancient religious leaders chose to leave out of the bible, there was indeed life before Adam.|`|f8JrAy5caa	No<br>  There is no Scriptural reference to it.

In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

Jehovah can direct and control this invisible force from heaven to accomplish whatever he wants. For example he used the Holy Spirit to help Noah built the Ark, he gave Holy Spirit to David to slay the Giant and to win many battles. He gave Holy Spirit to Samson to defeat the Philistines, with mighty feats. He gave Holy Spirit to Jesus and his Apostles to perform miracles, including resurrecting the dead. etc.  The Holy Spirit is not a person and is not God, it does not have a mind of its own it is an invisible force.

The Holy Ghost is manifested in every dispensation of the gospel since the beginning, being first made known to Adam (1 Ne. 10: 17-22; Moses 6: 51-68). The Holy Ghost is manifested to men on the earth both as the power of the Holy Ghost and as the gift of the Holy Ghost. The power can come upon one before baptism, and is the convincing witness that the gospel is true. It gives one a testimony of Jesus Christ and of his work and the work of his servants upon the earth. The gift can come only after proper and authorized baptism, and is conferred by the laying on of hands, as in Acts 8: 12-25 and Moroni 2: 1-3. The gift of the Holy Ghost is the right to have, whenever one is worthy, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. More powerful than that which is available before baptism, it acts as a cleansing agent to purify a person and sanctify him from all sin. Thus it is often spoken of as “fire” (Matt. 3: 11; 2 Ne. 31: 17; D&C 19: 31). The manifestation on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2) was the gift of the Holy Ghost that came upon the Twelve, without which they were not ready for their ministries to the world. <br>  <br>  For some reason not fully explained in the scriptures, the Holy Ghost did not operate in the fulness among the Jews during the years of Jesus’ mortal sojourn (John 7: 39; John 16: 7). Statements to the effect that the Holy Ghost did not come until after Jesus was resurrected must of necessity refer to that particular dispensation only, for it is abundantly clear that the Holy Ghost was operative in earlier dispensations. Furthermore, it has reference only to the gift of the Holy Ghost not being present, since the power of the Holy Ghost was operative during the ministries of John the Baptist and Jesus; otherwise no one would have received a testimony of the truths that these men taught (cf. Matt. 16: 16-17; 1 Cor. 12: 3). When a person speaks by the power of the Holy Ghost that same power carries a conviction of the truth into the heart of the hearer (2 Ne. 33: 1). The Holy Ghost knows all things (D&C 35: 19) and can lead one to know of future events (2 Pet. 1: 21). <br>  <br>  Other names that sometimes refer to the Holy Ghost are Holy Spirit, Spirit of god, Spirit of the Lord, Comforter, and Spirit.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	God<br>  <br>  If you would care to read some more of my position on the subject I have a page on my site on that subject...at: <a href="http://mikevanauken.pages.qpg.com/mikesfaith/id11.html" rel="nofollow">http://mikevanauken.pages.qpg.com/mikesf...</a><br>  <br>  feel free to look over the rest if you like... you ma contact me from the site with any question you may have on the basics.|`|b1233d2957b6685f6644485ce17a6f62aa	It's what's left of the Shekhinah after they made her gender-neutral. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekina" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shekina</a>|`|zBkaqIWcaa	The Spirit of God.<br>  The Spirit of the Father.<br>  The Spirit of the Son.|`|s7pqFa1eaa	Didn't you hear?

cR8UZdi1aa	Hi, I'm a JW, & I researched this. Apparently it was a "made up claim" about this Jeopardy question. It would be nice if it was on it, because it IS obviously the most accurate translation of the Holy Scriptures, people tend to believe things like Game Shows more then they do library's & encyclopedias. <br>  <br>  However, we don't need Game Shows to prove that the NWT is the most accurate translation, we know because of the research that has been done all over the world, for many many years, from all genre's of people & professions such as scientists, archaeologists & theologists. Even devote Clergy who have done serious studies of Bible translations & versions admit to this fact. So, game show question or not, it's the truth! <br>  <br>  So the claim that it is the most accurate translation is correct. But the claim that this question was asked on Jeopardy is most likely false.|`|k03dYskYaa	I did not get to see that episode. That is a good fact for the public to see. <br>  <br>  This Bible Scholar praises it, and I think the answer was based on his findings along with other scholars.<br>  <br>  Book: “TRUTH IN TRANSLATION: ACCURACY AND BIAS IN ENGLISH TRANSLATIONS OF THE NEW TESTAMENT”<br>  <br>  Author: Jason David BeDuhn is the Associate Professor of Religious Studies at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. He holds a B.A. in Religious Studies from the University of Illinois, Urbana, an M.T.S. in New Testament and Christian Origins form Harvard Divinity School, and a Ph.D. in Comparative Study of Religions form Indiana University, Bloomington<br>  <br>  The Nine English Translations Compared in BeDuhn’s book are:<br>  <br>  - The King James Version (KJV)<br>  <br>  - The Amplified Bible (AB)<br>  <br>  - The Living Bible (LB)<br>  <br>  - The New American Bible (NAB)<br>  <br>  - The New American Standard Bible (NASB)<br>  <br>  - The New International Version (NIV)<br>  <br>  - The New World Translation (NW)<br>  <br>  - The (New) Revised Standard Version (NRSV)<br>  <br>  - Today’s English Version (TEV)<br>  <br>  <br>  Excerpts from his book:<br>  <br>  Chapter Four: Examples of translation of the Greek word “proskuneo”, used 58 times in the New Testament. The word is translated various ways as worship, do obeisance, fall down on one’s knees, bow before. Scriptures discussed include Matt. 18:26; Rev. 3:9; Mark 15:18,19; Matt 2:1, 2, 8,11; Matt 14:33; Matt 28:9, “... in our exploration of this issue, we can see how theological bias has been the determining context for the choices made by all of the translations except the NAB and NW... translators seem to feel the need to add to the New Testament support for the idea that Jesus was recognized to be God.” Regarding Matt. 28:16, 17, where all versions except the NW use “worship” where the NW uses “did obeisance”: “Here all translations except the NW have recourse to “worship” -- a rendering which makes no sense in this context... This contradiction seems to be missed by all the translators except those who prepared the NW.”<br>  <br>  Chapter Five: A discussion of Philippians 2:5-1 1: “The NW translators... have understood “harpagmos” accurately as grasping at something one does not have, that is, a “seizure.” The literary context supports the NW translation (and refutes the KJV’s “thought it not robbery to be equal)...”<br>  <br>  Chapter Seven: A discussion on Col. 1: 15-20: “It is a tricky passage where every translation must add words.” “The LB translator is guilty of all the doctrinal importation discussed above with reference to the NIV, NRSV, and TEV, and even surpasses them in this respect. So it is the NIV, NRSV, TEV and LB -- the four Bibles that make no attempt to mark added words - that actually add the most significant tendentious material. Yet in many public forums on Bible translation, the practice of these four translations is rarely if ever pointed to or criticized, while the NW is attacked for adding the innocuous “other” in a way that clearly indicates its character as an addition of the translators... But the NW is correct. “Other” is implied in “all”, and the NW simply makes what is implicit explicit... It is ironic that the translation of Col. 1:15-20 that has received the most criticism is the one where the “added words” are fully justified by what is implied in the Greek.”<br>  <br>  Chapter Eight : A discussion on Titus 2:13; 2 Thess. 1:12; 2 Peter 1:1, 2: “... the position of those who insist “God” and “Savior” must refer to the same being... is decidedly weakened.”<br>  <br>  Chapter Nine: A discussion of Hebrews 8:1: “so we must conclude that the more probable translation is “God is your throne..., “the translation found in the NW... It seems likely that it is only because most translations were made by people who already believe that Jesus is God that the less probable way of translating this verse has been preferred.”<br>  <br>  Chapter Ten: A discussion on John 8:58: “Both the LB and the NW offer translations that coordinate the two verbs in John 8:58 according to proper English syntax, and that accurately reflect the meaning of the Greek idiom. The other translations fail to do this.” “There is absolutely nothing in the original Greek of John 8:58 to suggest that Jesus is quoting the Old Testament here, contrary to what the TEV tries to suggest by putting quotations marks around “I am.”<br>  <br>  “The majority of translations recognize these idiomatic uses of “I am”, and properly integrate the words into the context of the passages where they appear. Yet when it comes to 8:58, they suddenly forget how to translate.” “All the translations except the LB and NW also ignore the true relation between the verbs of the sentence and produce a sentence that makes no sense in English. These changes in the meaning of the Greek and in the normal procedure for translation point to a bias that has interfered with the work of the translators.” “No one listening to Jesus, and no one reading John in his own time would have picked up on a divine self-identification in the mere expression “I|`|7oCpSkmxaa	Here's a link to a blog on which the same thing was discussed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://boards.sonypictures.com/boards/showthread.php?t=31469" rel="nofollow">http://boards.sonypictures.com/boards/sh...</a><br>  <br>  I kinda don't think it really happened.

JCGtfNeTaa	Sure, the Bible is very clear about it. Those who reject God are totally and utterly destroyed. Several verses talk about the DESTRUCTION of the wicked.<br>  <br>  Revelation 20:7-10 tells us that hell will be on the face of this earth, that the wicked will surround the city of God (the New Jerusalem) and fire and brimstone will rain down upon them and DEVOUR them. Hell does not exist today, but it will one day. And it will be hotter than many Christians believe, because it won't merely be torturous but will burn them up.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 47:14 says tells of their utter destruction (the fire will go out once it's done its job):<br>  <br>  Behold, they shall be as stubble,<br>        The fire shall burn them;<br>        They shall not deliver themselves<br>        From the power of the flame;<br>        It shall not be a coal to be warmed by,<br>        Nor a fire to sit before! <br>  <br>  Malachi 4:1,3 tells of their utter destruction:<br>  <br>  “For behold, the day is coming,<br>        Burning like an oven,<br>        And all the proud, yes, all who do wickedly will be stubble.<br>        And the day which is coming shall burn them up,”<br>        Says the LORD of hosts,<br>  <br>        “ That will leave them neither root nor branch. <br>  <br>  You shall trample the wicked,<br>        For they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet<br>        On the day that I do this,”<br>        Says the LORD of hosts. <br>  <br>  <br>  "The soul who sins shall die." - Ezekiel 18:20<br>  <br>  2 Peter 2:6 tells us that Sodom and Gomorrah are examples to us as to what will happen to the ungodly. Those cities were destroyed, and are not still burning yet today (located where the dead sea is now)<br>  <br>  Revelation 21:1-8 tells us that there will be no more pain, for the former things have passed away. How can there be no more pain if there are those in eternal conscious torment?! How can the former things (like sin) have passed away if a former thing like sin and sinner still exist for all of eternity?!!<br>  <br>  To say that the wicked will experience eternal conscious torment is to bestow eternal life to them; something the Bible strictly denies:<br>  <br>  "He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life." - 1 John 5:12<br>  <br>  The Bible clearly teaches that we are not immortal, and that only God is immortal (1 Timothy 6:14-16) 1 Corinthians 15:53 tells us that we must put on immortality. If our souls are already immortal, then we would have no need to put on immortality.|`|AA10674998	They are blotted out of existence.<br>  <br>  What happens when a parent tells a kid that XBOX time is over?

Heaven would be hell to an irreligious man. We know how unhappy we are apt to feel at present, when alone in the midst of strangers, or of men of different tastes and habits from ourselves. How miserable, for example, would it be to have to live in a foreign land, among a people whose faces we never saw before, and whose language we could not learn. And this is but a faint illustration of the loneliness of a man of earthly dispositions and tastes, thrust into the society of saints and angels. How forlorn would he wander through the courts of heaven! He would find no one like himself; he would see in every direction the marks  of God's holiness, and these would make him shudder. He would feel himself always in His presence. He could no longer turn his thoughts another way, as he does now, when conscience reproaches him. He would know that the Eternal Eye was ever upon him; and that Eye of holiness, which is joy and life to holy creatures, would seem to him an Eye of wrath and punishment. God cannot change His nature. Holy He must ever be. But while He is holy, no unholy soul can be happy in heaven. "<br>  <br>  <br>  =====================<br>  Sermon 1.

That water wasn't flowing nowhere.<br>  <br>  Clouds float because they're water vapour, and we see the condensation when local atmospheric pressure drops and the droplets condense.  The vapour is less dense than the cool air below, so it floats.  If the condensation continues to the point that the droplets become too dense, they stop floating.  That's what we call rain (or snow, if it's cold enough).<br>  <br>  The sun shines because of internal hydrogen fusion releasing large amounts of energy, including lots and lots of photons.<br>  <br>  In general, the wind blows because of differentials in air pressure between different regions.  A lot of this has to do with the sun shine (see above), which hits different parts of the Earth at different angles and so impart different levels of heating to these regions.  <br>  <br>  It doesn't really "go" anywhere, any more than the contents of a bowl "go" anywhere when you stir them.  When one part of the atmosphere moves, the other parts are moved in conjunction.  Likewise, it doesn't really "come from" anywhere.  The atmosphere was already there.<br>  <br>  One lives because they obtain enough nutrients from their environment to sustain metabolic function, while avoiding physical injuries that inhibit the body's capability of maintaining those functions.

The moon's gravity is constantly pulling at the earth's oceans, and wind constantly blows across ponds and lakes.<br>  <br>  2. Clouds are less dense than the surrounding air, and thus float.

The sun shines because it is an extremely hot nuclear reactor causing the spontaneous combustion of vast amounts of gas-resources.<br>  <br>  4. The wind blows because the sun warms up the water over the equator, thus evaporating part of it and raising the water vapor. After reaching high altitudes, the vapor cools and condenses into clouds and rain. The constant rising and falling of this water vapor acts like a pump and causes winds to blow across the face of the earth. It doesn't come from or go anywhere.

b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	Of the 37 religions remaining 18 believe in the inherent immortality of the human soul. Does the Bible support them or eliminate them? There is not a scripture in the Bible that says man has an immortal soul. An earthly soul is a living, breathing, sentient creature, animal or human. It does not have a soul separate and distinct from the body, but can be said to have soul only in the sense that it has life. This definition includes animals as souls, which is contrary to the immortal-soul teaching but is in agreement with the Bible. Prior to man souls were created: “Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls.” “And God proceeded to create the great sea monsters and every living soul that glides.” Man was made a living soul, not an immortal one: “Then Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.” Men and animals are lumped together as souls, when a required tax was “one soul out of five hundred, of humankind and of the herd and of the asses and of the flock.” Also, “In case a man should strike any soul of mankind fatally, he should be put to death without fail. And the fatal striker of the soul of a domestic animal should make compensation for it, soul for soul.”—Gen. 1:20, 21; 2:7; Num. 31:28; Lev. 24:17, 18, NW.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	Please read in Genesis 2:7 And Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils (nose) the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.<br>  <br>  When you see "Living soul" it mean that person becoming alive mean soul.<br>  <br>  A soul mean someone is still alive but still breathing.<br>  <br>  When you see "Blow into his nostrils the breath of life" ...That mean his body is working alive like a flesh. <br>  But when you died then your body stopped working and your thinking stopped everything will stopped then your soul is gone.|`|AA10671142	I remember years ago a mormon was in my home and we showed him Genesis chapter 2 verse seven.

b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	Jehovah God did not create humans to go to heaven after they died. It was not his original purpose that they should die at all. Adam and Eve were created perfect and were given the opportunity to fill the earth with righteous offspring. (Genesis 1:28; Deuteronomy 32:4) Our first parents were told that they would die only if they disobeyed God. (Genesis 2:17) If they had remained obedient to their heavenly Father, they would have kept on living on earth forever.<br>  <br>  9 Sadly, though, Adam and Eve failed to obey God. (Genesis 3:6, 7) The tragic consequences are described by the apostle Paul: “Through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned.” (Romans 5:12) Instead of living forever on earth, Adam and Eve died. What happened then? Did they have immortal souls that could now be consigned to a fiery hell because of their sin? On the contrary, the Bible says that earlier, when he was created, Adam “came to be a living soul.” (Genesis 2:7) Man was not given a soul; he became a soul, a living person. (1?Corinthians 15:45) Why, not only was Adam “a living soul” but, as shown in the Hebrew language in which Genesis was written, the lower animals were “living souls” too! (Genesis 1:24) When Adam and Eve died, they became dead souls. Eventually, it happened to them just as Jehovah had said to Adam: “In the sweat of your face you will eat bread until you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken. For dust you are and to dust you will return.”—Genesis 3:19.<br>  <br>  10 In substance, the New Catholic Encyclopedia agrees with this. In its article “Soul (in the Bible),” it says: “There is no dichotomy [division into two parts] of body and soul in the OT [“Old Testament,” or Hebrew Scriptures].” It adds that in the Bible, the word “soul” “never means soul as distinct from the body or the individual person.” Indeed, soul often “means the individual being itself whether of animals or men.” Such candor is refreshing, but one can only wonder why churchgoers in general have not been made aware of these facts.<br>  <br>  11 How much concern and fear churchgoers would have been spared if they had known the simple Bible truth: “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die,” not suffer in hellfire! (Ezekiel 18:4) While this is very different from what Christendom teaches, it is entirely consistent with what the wise man Solomon said under inspiration: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all, neither do they anymore have wages [in this life], because the remembrance of them has been forgotten. All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol [mankind’s common grave], the place to which you are going.”—Ecclesiastes 9:5, 10|`|vSlG3ayiaa	arioch, I think you're absosmurfly right that a soul is a person.  But the question now is, "What is a person?"  I think a person is an immaterial thing.  We are not identical to our bodies.  Matthew 10:28 makes this clear.<br>  <br>  Think about what you are saying.  You interpret the inability to kill the soul to mean "for all time," since you believe in a resurrection.  But resurrection involve physical bodies.  By your reasoning, the passage ought to also say that nobody can kill the body either.  Or it should say you can kill both the soul AND the body, but that God will raise it up on the last day.<br>  <br>  If we are identical to our bodies, then whatever happens to our body happens to us.  It would not be possible for something to happen to a body and not happen to a soul.

AdmtROXUaa	Bruce,<br>  <br>  What it comes down to is a matter of Truth.  As Aristotle showed with his principle of non-contradiction long before Christianity showed up, if something is true the opposite must be false.  People innately know this, even without good old Aristotle pointing it out.  So, if christianity is true, then it is worth believing, it is life changing, it is the most important truth that humanity can ever be reconciled to, for christianity gives us the full picture of humanity, our origin, meaning, destinty, salvation.  C.S. Lewis said it well: "I believe in Christianity as I believe the sun has risen, not just because I see it, but because by it, I see everything else." <br>  <br>  FYI Catholic christianity (to which I espouse) does not teach that other religions are necessarily false, but that they may contain many elements of truth.  However, the Catholic Church also holds that she contains the fullness of revealed Truth as she is the Bride of Christ.  Also, the catholic church does not say that people of other religions cannot be saved, another common misconception.|`|ORmrJXRxaa	The best thing is that everyone be Christians, which means followers of Christ who borne our sins on the cross and is our hope for salvation. <br>  That is the ideal but I accept that it is not at all possible.

Now for the "caveat".<br>  <br>  As I said, "I believe" my faith is the correct faith.   While I do deeply feel others would benefit from Catholicism, I have to acknowledge they most likely believe as strongly as I that their faith, be it another denomination of Christianity or one of the Non_Christian based faiths is the correct and proper way to worship God, The Almighty.<br>  <br>  The Catholic Church itself holds that non-Catholics are not withheld from salvation due to their non-Catholicism (please, no remarks about ancient history, that was then, this is now.   Besides, who of us don't have ancestors, past countrymen or past religious leaders who'd be way back in the line of that "throw the first stone thing").<br>  <br>  Who knows, maybe God, in His infinite wisdom sees our various outlooks towards Him as a way of keeping our faith alive and our thoughts (and mouths, lol) always going in His direction.<br>  <br>  <br>  Think about it and regards,<br>  <br>  Lenny.|`|Z1Gw6lVqaa	Um think about this logically.

This number, when used figuratively, conveys the thought of singleness, uniqueness, as well as unity and agreement in purpose and action. “Jehovah our God is one Jehovah,” said Moses. (De 6:4) He alone is Sovereign. He is unique. He does not share his glory with another, as is the case with pagan trinitarian gods. (Ac 4:24; Re 6:10; Isa 42:8) There is oneness in purpose and activity between Jehovah and Jesus Christ (Joh 10:30) and there should be complete unity of Christ’s disciples with God, with his Son, and with one another. (Joh 17:21; Ga 3:28) Such oneness is illustrated in the marriage arrangement.—Ge 2:24; Mt 19:6; Eph 5:28-32.<br>  <br>  God is a God of order and not of disorder. He wants all of his spiritual and earthly children to unite in Hid one faith, he wants them to follow Him as he is a jealous God and wants exclusive devotin, and we should be baptised to request a good conscience before our God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes one faith is God's way.

That's just the excuse you use to cover your judgmentalism.<br>  <br>  "You're an idiot... etc." is how the person feels about you.<br>  <br>  Did that person ask your opinion? Or are you so egotistical that you expressed your judgment because you are perfect in your own mind, which warrants you telling people about the faults you judge them to have wether anyone gives a damn about your opinion or not?

Telling a thief that they are going to hell because they stole is judging. The first is the truth the second is passing judgment on someone. <br>  <br>  Many feel that they are being judged when they told the truth but they are mistaking conviction for judgment. Conviction gives them guilty conscience and they mistake if for being judged. They feel bad and if it is conviction it means they are wrong, if they claim that it is judgement, then that means someone else is making them feel bad and they do not have to take responsiblity for why they feel bad. <br>  <br>  Pro 15:10 Correction [is] grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: [and] he that hateth reproof shall die.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Believing that you know what is a sin for another person is your first mistake.

If I know who I am, what I think and feel, then when someone tells me what to think and feel, I am likely to feel the potential injury, and try to avoid it.<br>  <br>  Think of a woman walking down the street, and a guy walking up to her and saying, "Sex with me will be the best you ever have - you need an orgasm, lady."  That boundary violation is offensive.<br>  <br>  That's the same way it feels to someone with healthy boundaries when you talk about religion.  Boundary violations don't feel good to people with healthy boundaries.|`|pqveENjUaa	Because you are placing a label on others. Granted, in Christianity it is believed that everyone is born a sinner.

A lot of people will take offense to you calling them a sinner, especially if they are living what they believe to be good lives and if they aren't Christian. <br>  <br>  Obviously, the second is a much more blatant form of judging, but placing beliefs of your religion on others can be considered judging too. Maybe if it had been "According to Christianity everyone is a sinner," then it wouldn't have been taken as judgment?|`|AA10096992	Yes, it's judging.

As a Christian, this is what I believe.  <br>  <br>  However, interestingly enough, while most non-Christians scoff that the notion that there is only one-way, in fact, every religion has it's one-way!  For example:<br>  <br>  All religions in the world make absolute truth claims regarding the way to salvation…<br>  <br>  ?Christians proclaim that salvation comes by grace through faith in Jesus Christ. <br>  ? <br>  ?Hindus claim that salvation (liberation) is achieved when a person transcends this world of illusion by building up enough positive karma (good works) to escape the cycle of reincarnation. <br>  ? <br>  ?Muslims state that the possibility of salvation* results from submitting one’s life to Allah and faithfully carrying-out the Five Pillars of Islam (one of which is killing unbelievers). <br>  ? <br>  ?Buddhists say that salvation (Nirvana) is the result of detaching one’s self from the desires of the physical, material world. <br>  <br>  Each of the world’s religions claims to promote the true path to salvation, but each of these religions provides a distinct and contrary path from all of the others. Thus, one of these paths to salvation is true, or none of them are true, but they cannot all be true at the same time; this would be a violation of the Law of Non-Contradiction.|`|SZTm6mwmaa	He is not the best way to the Father.

If you read early Christian history, you'll see that the ancient Romans called the Christians cannibals because the Christians believed they were receiving their Lord Jesus in the bread and wine.

Good luck with finding the answer but if it was true they would not be considered cannibals because they would be eating themsleves, because god lives in your heart mind and spirit so they would be eating themselves i guess? Its kinda hard to explain but yeah.... Praise the lord!|`|MiAOnwN6aa	The wine & bread substantially become the real blood & body of Christ at the consecration during the Mass. There is no scientific proof since the accidents of bread & wine still remain & continue to nourish us as bread & wine. Therefore, cannibalism is not applicable. This belief requires pure faith based upon scripture.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	NO, we believe it becomes the Body and Blood of Christ when it is confected by the priest acting in Persona Christi.<br>  <br>  There is no scientific proof to back it up because the Lord said for it to profit us it must be believed in our spiritual senses instead of carnal reason.<br>  <br>  No, this is not cannibalism but such claims have always, from the first century until today, been the criticism of those who reject Christ's Church. <br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|wxBFZ41Taa	No, we believe it becomes the true Body and Blood of Christ at the consecration. <br>  <br>  No, there is no scientific proof, because the elements do not change. But Christ is wholly present under the species of bread and wine. <br>  <br>  If you believe in the Incarnation, you should have less trouble believing in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Jesus was fully God and fully man. Those who saw him saw a man, he looked like a man, had the DNA of a man, had all the physical attributes of a man...and yet he was fully God under the appearance of a man. So it is with the Eucharist. It's a miracle.|`|qVcDlp9Raa	Jesus a good source for carbs.|`|51WK9mGvaa	47 Amen, amen, I say to you, whoever believes has eternal life. 48 I am the bread of life. 49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the desert, but they died; 50 this is the bread that comes down from heaven so that one may eat it and not die. 51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven; whoever eats this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give is my flesh for the life of the world."<br>  <br>  52 The Jews quarreled among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us (his) flesh to eat?" 53 Jesus said to them, "Amen, amen, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life within you. 54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him on the last day. 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. 56 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me and I in him. 57 Just as the living Father sent me and I have life because of the Father, so also the one who feeds on me will have life because of me. 58 This is the bread that came down from heaven. Unlike your ancestors who ate and still died, whoever eats this bread will live forever." 59 These things he said while teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.<br>  <br>  60 Then many of his disciples who were listening said, "This saying is hard; who can accept it?" 61 Since Jesus knew that his disciples were murmuring about this, he said to them, "Does this shock you? 62 What if you were to see the Son of Man ascending to where he was before? 63 It is the spirit that gives life, while the flesh is of no avail. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. 64 But there are some of you who do not believe." Jesus knew from the beginning the ones who would not believe and the one who would betray him. 65 And he said, "For this reason I have told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by my Father."<br>  <br>  66 As a result of this, many (of) his disciples returned to their former way of life and no longer accompanied him. 67 Jesus then said to the Twelve, "Do you also want to leave?" 68 Simon Peter answered him, "Master, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life. 69 We have come to believe and are convinced that you are the Holy One of God." <br>  <br>  Jesus speaks to us in these passages, and He makes himself very clear.  Jesus’ body is the bread and His blood is the wine. We must eat His body and drink His blood. While it is true that we do this in “remembrance” as He said at the Last Supper, make no mistake about it, there is no symbolism whatsoever in Jesus‘ Word here. To this day there is only one Church passed down form the apostles almost 2000 years ago where you can eat and drink the true presence of our Lord Jesus Christ.  None of us can fully understand how the Eucharist works.  We must simply have the faith that because Jesus himself taught this, it is Truth. Now is your chance to come home to Jesus’ one true Holy Catholic and Apostolic Church.  The reformists from the past whom started your churches may have had valid reasons for being upset with the Catholic Church, but they went about fixing it in the wrong way.  We should not have divided.  We should have stayed united. Think about where your church came from, and if you are not sure, do a little research into the history of your church.  You will find that your church either broke off directly from the Catholic Church or broke off of a denomination that broke off directly from the Catholic Church.  We allowed Lucifer to divided us into thousands of pieces and take away form you the most important part of the Mass, The Most Holy Eucharist.  The longer we are divided, the more divided we are becoming.  There are over 40,000 denominations world wide and the number of people leaving to start their own religion is growing every day. Remember the old military saying “divide and conquer“? Today even the denominations are splitting into denominations.  There is no doubt about it, we have been divided, and if we don’t reunite soon, the devil is going to show us an evil that will make 9/11 look small in comparison.  Now is the time for us to fix what was broken into thousands of denominations by Satan, which started hundreds of years ago, and we all have to come together to work as one Church as Jesus originally intended for us. Greatness will come out of a united Christianity under one Catholic Church once again.|`|4Xy28QJkaa	Yes. Once the priest consecrated the Eucharist, it becomes Holy. The priest is given this honor by God, so anything that a priest does is in Jesus' name. (And to all of you who are going to say 'Do priests molest kids in the name of Jesus', well you are wrong.) There are bad priests who abuse their rights, and who ARE wrong, but you  can't let a bunch of rotten apples ruin the whole barrel!!!!!!!!<br>            Anyway, back to your question, no, we are not cannibals, that would be murder, and the Fifth Commandment states that YOU SHALL NOT KILL!!!!!!!! <br>            So I hope that that answered your question.|`|RuFZABFxaa	What?  The eucharist is symbolic and even when I was a Catholic I, and everybody I knew, considered it symbolic.  It's even written in that context in the bible when Jesus pronounced that such-and-such represents such-and-such.<br>  <br>  The canibalistic angle is underscored in Gibson's Passion where the Jews jeered such a thing.<br>  <br>  "Body" and "blood" aren't meant to mean what you're thinking they mean.

AA10676836	No its a deception. <br>  Look there is a battle going on right now for your mind. It is a battle between God and Satan. Jesus is coming back soon. I mean in just a couple of years.

But we can overcome this.

Do Christians think Jesus appreciates it when he sees them puking in the porcelain?<br>  No. Alcohol leads to wife beating, tearing up of families, and drunk accidents.<br>  <br>  Wife beating is not allowed. The Quran says that you will be punished if you even leave a bruise on your wife.<br>  <br>  Also, no pork. This is to test us to see how well we can resist any temptation.<br>  <br>  Many say that women are subordinate to mean. This is not necessarily the case. Men do the work outside the home because it is proven that they are physically stronger. Women take care of the children because they are more patient. Also, women have many priveleges over men in the household. If women worked outside, this would leave many parents both working. If they can't deal with the stress, this leads to a divorce, which is not reccomended in Islam. It tears up families. Family value is very important in Islam.

There are many holy books in Islam but the Koran is the highest, followed by the Hadith, and the others come after that. But in the Koran and Hadith there are contradictions, and so there is always the question, of which one do we follow. That question was answered in the Koran and gives the solution.<br>  <br>  FROM THE KORAN<br>  2:106<br>  Whatever a verse (revelation) do we abrogate or cause to be forgotten, We bring a better one or similar to it. Know you not that Allah is able to do all things?<br>  <br>  This basically means tha Allah changed his mind and the later teachings take priority.<br>  <br>  Here is how it works. from highest priority to lowest.<br>  1st priority  - Later teachings in the Koran<br>  2nd Priority - Earlier teachings in the Koran<br>  3rd Priority  - Later teachings in the Hadith<br>  4th Priority  - Earlier teachings in the Hadith<br>  <br>  All other teachings and sources come after that.<br>  <br>  Anytime you have a contradiction, you follow Juris Prudence and follow that one.<br>  <br>  As a side not, SURA 9 is part of the later teachings of the Koran and is amoung the most violent. This is one of the reasons why many terrorist activities take place, because those muslims are following Juris Prudence.

And Aisha is a very mature woman as she memorized lots and lots of Hadiths of the Prophet and is a great source to a lot of the Prophet's sayings.<br>  <br>  Also, the Pagans back then were looking for anything in order to use it against The Prophet. But History tells us that this issue was never the object of attention to all of the disbelievers which proves that it was normal and that a 9-year-old was not a child back then.<br>  <br>  Also, check this out:<br>  <br>  In the 19th century, the minimum age for marriage for female women in most states of America was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The British law of year 1911, stated that the permissible age for women to get married was 12 years old<br>  <br>  so, please don't take the answers of some people who are ignorant about Muhammed (PBUH) as the truth and make such a comment like: "he had sex with 9 year old kid.. it is really sick." as first of all she was not a "kid" and it's still not historically agreed upon on the age....<br>  <br>  Hope i have helped.<br>  Peace...

As an example, Jamie Farr(Klinger on Mash), is Christain Arab American, by birth, of Lebanese ancestry, as am I. Does Jamie Farr(Arab Semitic White Ammerican)  and Bill Cosby(Black American) look like they belong in the same ethnic group?The late Anwar Sadat was half Egyptian Arab Semitic White(father)-half Black Sudanese-people of Kemit-Nubian(mother)-he denied this until shortly before his death, always claiming to be Arab Semitic White.

tJBvGea5aa	They are all Great Prophets who delivered the message of monotheism. The stories of previous Prophets are helpful to all mankind. The great experiences and testings in them made them a timeless guidance for us to learn more about Religion and nature of humans. <br>  <br>  Allah sends Prophets to certain people with a miracle that is in the same area where the people are most good at.<br>  <br>  For example, people of Moses (PBUH), were very good at magic. So, Moses (PBUH) was sent down with the miracles of performing what exceeds magic.<br>  <br>  Also, people of Jesus (PBUH), were very good at medical science. So, Jesus (PBUH) was sent down with the miracles of performing what is beyond science of healing.<br>  <br>  The same with Prophet Muhammed (PBUH), his people (The Arabs) were very good in the Arabic language and in reciting peotry. So, Muhammed (PBUH) was sent down with the greatest miracle; The Quran. The greatest of the greatest peots could not defy it. They were sure it was not human's words. It must have been divine. That was what made people believe Muhammed (PBUH). Also, the great teachings he taught and the great person he was attracted the attnetion of many to Islam and the Quran.<br>  <br>  Hope i have answered your question...<br>  Peace  :)|`|a63qA8wzaa	no|`|G2yUpoqfaa	The prophets DID NOT DO what Muhammad did.  It is scandalous to even think so.  The prophets did not seek fame or divine interlocution. God sought them and they prayerfully responded to help their people. Moses was one of them. Their prophecies predicted the coming of the divine Redeemer, who when He came, fulfilled each one, His name is Jesus, (Messiah, Saviour) He was crucified, He was resurrected by the Father, He was taken to Heaven where He shall Judge the living and the dead. The prophets knew scripture and for 4,000 years had prayed for His coming. <br>  <br>  Muhammad could not read the scriptures, and when he was orally instructed by the Jews or the Christians, he distorted what he heard, to their astonishment and horror.  With these errors in mind, he foisted upon his countrymen an religion unheard of, and often in violation of the Arab traditions. <br>  <br>  Muhammad could not read any of the languages of his nearby countries.  He could not read Latin or Mosaic Hebrew.  He had no credentials, either secular of hierarchical, for his self-appointed "mission."   He was not spiritual.  He was attracted to religion, but not to its teachings.  His took on a title of prophet and by this gained attention; it empowered him to devise a religion to suit self-glorification..  From 30 years onward he became impressed with the sermon of the end of the world.  He withdrew to solitude and contemplated his virtually godless life, upon which his thoughts solidified into "voices" and "faces" which he "saw."  He stirred himself into psychotic-styled imaginings.<br>  <br>  He began to see spirits.  He called them the Archangel Gabriel and he imagined his way into a pseudo Prophethood by diabolical visions.  His words are still preserved in a Surah.  He wrote that mankind needed to be "reproved" and it is to be done by Muslims, indicating his knowledge of Christ was missing.  He won no credence for his "visionary" claims.  Only his wife was familiar with his ideas, and she believed his "vision."  <br>  <br>  In reality, Muhammad's concern was to warn the Makkans (of the end times) but he found satisfaction in his gift of gab and his self-appointed title, "divine" to his listeners, and especially in "clear Arabic speech," for a change.  After the first revelation, there was a rather long intermission in the supernatural apparitions; then the whole weight of the divine inspiration came (arose?) upon him.  In one admonition after another, he forcefully expressed in the style of the old Arab soothsayers (kahins); he found pictures of unexampled grandeur wherewith to forewarn his people of the doom which threatened if they did not follow him in the way of repentance and "god's" will. <br>  <br>  He promoted among his camp that the polemic of Christianity of earlier times was unquestionably wrong when it saw in Muhammad an epileptic or an impostor, a man who consciously uttered untruths in order to act against God's will.  Muhammad would insist that he was a sincere divine god-prophet!  The religious ideas which Muhammad represented were designated by him, its name, its style, its goals.  They were acceptable, however, to only a very few of his fellow citizens, to certain members of his family, like his cousin, Ali, to a respected notable, Abu Bakr, and to a few slaves.  The great mass of the Makkans were unmoved by the new "Prophet"; when Muhammad began to preach, they were glad to be diverted by a story-teller who related to them legends of the Persian heroes.  Muhammad himself cherished hopes of support from the Christians and Jews, with whose concepts he regarded his revelation as basically identical, and he did not hesitate to converse with such of his Jewish fellow-countrymen, in particular, as came his way.  Through them he learnt the main elements of the Jewish traditions, especially those bearing on popular piety, albeit in forms which were much distorted and which he probably often misunderstood.  These also influenced the revelations which he uttered at this time.  Soon both the Jews and his heathen opponents observed that the revelations contained manifest misunderstandings, and they did not hesitate to hold this up against him.  Though occasionally embarrassed, Muhammad nevertheless maintained unshakably that the messages were divinely inspired and, if subjective, then rightly so, in that the religious thoughts by which he was moved merged insensibly into the trances in which the revelations were communicated to him.  Jewish and Christian narrations, and Arab national traditions, gave Muhammad material for the stories of the Prophets with which he sought to warn (scare?) his people and bring them to his obedience.  These were constantly reiterated and expressed in an increasingly erudite style, tedious to Western tastes and markedly different from the highly poetic revelations of the earliest period.  Little by little the band of Believers grew. Higher ranking persons joined.

Someone hears his cry and someone comes to the rescue. That is the condition of all people we are drowning in our sins and when we cry out to Jesus then He saves us. He saves us as we are. He doesn't tell us to learn to swim first. Jesus came to seek and to save those that are lost.

I'm good enough without some kind of crutch!" - but other than that, people need to know the facts, but if they feel condemned, it's probably conviction from the Holy Spirit touching their conscience, and making them "squirm" so to speak.<br>  <br>  While it's true that Jesus didn't come to condemn the world, the very next verse says that those who do NOT believe are condemned already.<br>  <br>  If a person doesn't realize their need, they won't look to the answer.<br>  <br>  It's the same way that if a person doesn't realize that their house is on fire, they won't try to do anything to put it out.<br>  <br>  Some people just need more convincing (convicting) than others.<br>  <br>  But Jesus said that He would send the Holy Spirit "to convict of sin, righteousness and judgement."  But many people, not wanting to admit they have sinned, call it "condemning" when, in reality, it's just good old fashioned, Holy Spirit conviction of sin.
LuN1unJ3aa	Given the state and attitude of some Christians (not all of them), the idea has merit, especially for those who advertise the "authentic" Jesus and are so quick to condemn all but the followers of their particular path to hell.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I would KNOW that somebody is making money off some stupid atheists.

One who knows Jesus, and rejects the message of God, thus rejecting God, accepts the Devil and sin.  They will go to Hell.  One's who've never heard about the Gospels have never had the chance to reject God.  You are correct about the gate being narrow.  People professing Christian belief will reflect that belief in their lives.  I believe there will be many good people in Hell.  They profess their Belief but never make the committment to Christ even one second prior to death because they do not really understand the meaning of belief.  Prettty sad.  Perhaps you can gently tell someone the real meaning of Belief without insulting them.  Thats what being a missionary is all about.

See the nature of Christianity. As Christians we profess to attend upon Christ, to honour him, also to be waiting for his coming. Sincere Christians are the wise virgins, and hypocrites the foolish ones. Those are the truly wise or foolish that are so in the affairs of their souls. Many have a lamp of profession in their hands, but have not, in their hearts, sound knowledge and settled resolution, which are needed to carry them through the services and trials of the present state. Their hearts are not stored with holy dispositions, by the new-creating Spirit of God. Our light must shine before men in good works; but this is not likely to be long done, unless there is a fixed, active principle in the heart, of faith in Christ, and love to God and our brethren. They all slumbered and slept. The delay represents the space between the real or apparent conversion of these professors, and the coming of Christ, to take them away by death, or to judge the world. But though Christ tarry past our time, he will not tarry past the due time. The wise virgins kept their lamps burning, but they did not keep themselves awake. Too many real Christians grow remiss, and one degree of carelessness makes way for another. Those that allow themselves to slumber, will scarcely keep from sleeping; therefore dread the beginning of spiritual decays. A startling summons was given. Go ye forth to meet Him, is a call to those prepared. The notice of Christ’s approach, and the call to meet him, will awaken. Even those best prepared for death have work to do to get actually ready, 2Peter 3:14. It will be a day of search and inquiry; and it concerns us to think how we shall then be found. Some wanted oil to supply their lamps when going out. Those that take up short of true grace, will certainly find the want of it one time or other. An outward profession may light a man along this world, but the damps of the valley of the shadow of death will put out such a light. Those who care not to live the life, yet would die the death of the righteous. But those that would be saved, must have grace of their own; and those that have most grace, have none to spare. The best need more from Christ. And while the poor alarmed soul addresses itself, upon a sick-bed, to repentance and prayer, in awful confusion, death comes, judgment comes, the work is undone, and the poor sinner is undone for ever. This comes of having oil to buy when we should burn it, grace to get when we should use it. Those, and those only, shall go to heaven hereafter, that are made ready for heaven here. The suddenness of death and of Christ’s coming to us then, will not hinder our happiness, if we have been prepared. The door was shut. Many will seek admission into heaven when it is too late. The vain confidence of hypocrites will carry them far in expectations of happiness. The unexpected summons of death may alarm the Christian; but, proceeding without delay to trim his lamp, his graces often shine more bright; while the mere professor’s conduct shows that his lamp is going out. Watch therefore, attend to the business of your souls. Be in the fear of the Lord all the day long.|`|UL3XOKJxaa	The unprepared...not unbelievers, because as you notice, they believed.<br>  Did you also notice, there was no second chance.

AA11232725	Here's what Zodiates Word Study has to say about the soul.<br>  <br>  psuche?; gen. psuche?s, fem. noun from psúcho? (G5594), to breathe, blow. Soul, that immaterial part of man held in common with animals. One's understanding of this word's relationship to related terms is contingent upon his position regarding biblical anthropology. <br>  <br>  Dichotomists view man as consisting of two parts (or substances), material and immaterial, with spirit and soul denoting the immaterial and bearing only a functional and not a metaphysical difference. <br>  <br>  Trichotomists also view man as consisting of two parts (or substances), but with spirit and soul representing in some contexts a real subdivision of the immaterial. This latter view is here adopted. Accordingly, psuche? is contrasted to so??ma (G4983), body, and pneúma (G4151), spirit (1Th_5:23). <br>  <br>  The psuche?, no less than the sárx (G4561), flesh, belongs to the lower region of man's being. Sometimes psuche?? stands for the immaterial part of man made up of the soul (psuche?? in the restrictive sense of the life element), and the spirit pneúma. However, animals are not said to possess a spirit; this is only in man, giving him the ability to communicate with God. <br>  <br>  Also breath (Septuagint.: Gen_1:30; Job_41:12), and in the NT, usually meaning the vital breath, the life element through which the body lives and feels, the principle of life manifested in the breath.<br>  <br>  (I) The soul as the vital principle, the animating element in men and animals.<br>  <br>  (II) Specifically the soul as the sentient principle, the seat of the senses, desires, affections, appetites, passions, the lower aspect of one's nature. Distinguished in Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy from the higher rational nature, expressed by noús (G3563), mind, and pneúma (G4151), spirit belonging to man only. <br>  <br>  This distinction is also followed by the Septuagint and sometimes in the NT (cf. pneúma [G4151], spirit, II, B). In 1Th_5:23 the whole man is indicated as consisting of spirit, soul, and body; soul and spirit, the immaterial part of man upon which the word of God is operative (Heb_4:12); "my soul . . . and my spirit," the immaterial part of personality with which Mary could magnify the Lord (Luk_1:46-47). Distinguished from diánoia (G1271), understanding or mind, because soul is related to the affections<br>  <br>  (III) Metonymically, a soul, a living thing in which is he? psuche?, life.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	They must not read the bible because they think when the fleshly body dies the spiritual body floats off to heaven to sit on a cloud.<br>  <br>  They don't know that when God breathed into Adams nostrils he became a living soul....and the fish and animals also are called souls.<br>  So it can't be something intanible..it has to be the living thing itself.|`|Bi1W5U35aa	Without prophets, understandings become very complicated.

He is the ruler of this world most professed Christians agrees that he is running things... Who are the ones favorably impressed and deceived by such unscriptural “powerful work and lying signs and portents”? For whom are such things designed by the slyly operating Satan? The apostle Paul says that the “operation of Satan” during the presence of the clerical “lawless one” is “with every unrighteous deception for those who are perishing, as a retribution because they did not accept the love of the truth that they might be saved. So that is why God lets an operation of error go to them, that they may get to believing the lie, in order that they all may be judged because they did not believe the truth but took pleasure in unrighteousness.”—2?Thessalonians 2:10-12.<br>  <br>   God does not directly send an “operation of error” to these deceived ones. He lets it go to them, in order to prove what it is that they want and also because this is really what they want. This is what the apostle Paul pointed out to his fellow missionary Timothy in a final letter to him. Paul explained why he wanted Timothy to preach God’s Word urgently in all seasons in the Christian congregation. Paul said: “For there will be a period of time when they will not put up with the healthful teaching, but, in accord with their own desires, they will accumulate teachers for themselves to have their ears tickled; and they will turn their ears away from the truth, whereas they will be turned aside to false stories.” (2?Timothy 4:2-4) By means of the inspired Word of God a person can protect himself against an “operation of error” during the presence of the “lawless one.” But by letting Satan carry on an “operation of error” and by thus letting this operation go to the professed Christians, Jehovah God puts them to the proof as to whether they “accept the love of the truth” or love the lie.<br>  <br>  Our hope is in the resurrection.|`|VncSMLMpaa	The soul refers to us as people not some floaty bit that some churches have tried to imply.

Drucker predicts that the dominant factor for business will be demographics: underpopulation, not overpopulation, will pose the greatest challenge to economists and businessmen in the future.

His central messages are: Raw materials and energy are less scarce. The world's food supply is improving. Pollution in the U.S. has been decreasing. Population growth and immigration have long-term benefits. Simon challenges the doomsayers in this collection of essays, and explains why their beliefs are so widespread.<br>  <br>  Simon, Julian L., The Ultimate Resource 2, Princeton: Princeton University Press 1996 (734 pp.)<br>  <br>  The Ultimate Resource 2 is a revised and expanded edition of Julian Simon's The Ultimate Resource (1981), in which he argues that the ultimate resource is human intelligence.

(No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes the following observation: "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us."|`|AJr98ZReaa	kid... i don't know what to say. I don't think there is a God.

When we die, we leave our material bodies.  True religion is the eternal relationship of every living being (including you, I, your mom, etc) with a supreme living being.  The relationship is love.  Love takes two and makes both happy.  This material world is not our real home.  Nor these material bodies are real us.  We all have a spiritual body that is really us.  It is not that God invented heaven and hell and His only job is to determine who goes where.  Heaven can be accessed by pure devotional service to the Supreme.  We are in this material world because we did not want to serve God purely.  We all had some impurity one way or another.  We all to some degree wanted to be the supreme enjoy-er, and envied God and thus were not eligible to stay in the spiritual world.  By illusory energy of the Lord we came down to material world.  We re incarnate.  Meaning we take different material bodies as long as we ourselve truely want to stay in the material realm.  We can go back home by a simple method.  However when we get purified we will no longer care where God wants us to be.  Love for God transcends where we want to be.  We will be were God wants us to be.|`|901gcIS1aa	yea theres no heaven or hell either sorry.  its normal to wish that your relatives are in a better place and you will see them again, but the simple fact is you wont.  they are dead and they are decomposing in the ground fertilizing our land and turning slowly into fossil fuel.  just like you will be doing too when you die.  welcome to the real world where the only person judging whether or not your a decent person is you.  so live for yourself and not to try to get into some imaginary place.|`|si3eq11haa	God created heaven and hell. <br>  if there were no God, there would be no heaven, hell or us...<br>  the only way to heaven is by accepting Jesus as the Son of God, and accepting the gift of eternal life He offers.<br>  if you don't believe in Jesus, in God, you will not go to heaven.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The truth is that death brings IMMEDIATE heaven or hell, depending ONLY on whether you believe in Jesus alone for salvation or not. <br>  <br>  So to be in heaven and not hell, believe in Jesus alone for salvation now! :) <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

I am one Christian who is not going to pretend like he knows all the answers. The truth is that I don't really know! But I suspect one of the following to be true:<br>  <br>  1. It depends on whether or not they can tell right from wrong. Mentally handicapped people vary greatly in intellect. If they are incapable of making moral choices, then yes, they probably get a free ride. They are not intellectually responsible for their actions.<br>  <br>  2. If reincarnation exists, that is another possibility. I don't personally believe in it, but I cannot discount the possibility, either.<br>  <br>  3. God is not the crazy, arbitrary bearded man that people act like he is. I agree with Isaac Newton: the order of the cosmos suggests a rational, scientific God. I further believe that God is good (though I am not going to go into this debate here, as you could write a book on it). So naturally I believe that God will do right.

The age of accountability, though different for each person, would be somewhere around the age of 6-12 years, at whice point a person begins to understand abstract concepts such as sin, grace, forgiveness, guilt, etc., and can understand the gospel plan.<br>  <br>  It is that way because that is how God created us.|`|pMnMgt4Vaa	If they have that mental capability to make decisions, then yes, they are just like everyone else.

d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	The word appears in the Gospel of John, and is the English rendering for the Greek word "monogenes". The word can mean literally "only begotten", or it can also mean "unique".<br>  <br>  Actually the word first appears in the Old Testament when God describes Isaac As Abraham's unique or only begotten son:<br>  <br>   "Then God said, "Take your son, your only son, Isaac, whom you love, and go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains I will tell you about." "<br>  Genesis 22:2<br>  <br>  Now Abraham had an older son, Ishmael, through his concubine Hagar; yet God referred to Isaac as "your only son" because in God's eyes, Isaac was the unique son who was promised to Abraham by God, and through whom the promises God had given Abraham would be realized.<br>  <br>  I believe the reference then is to Jesus as the pre-incarnate Word of God, who was not a created being, but was derived from the very substance of the Father before time began. It also refers to Jesus in the resurrection from the dead, when according to Paul in his sermon in Acts Chapter 13 this word was fulfilled as prophesied in Psalm 2:7<br>  " I will tell of the decree:The LORD said to me, "You are my Son;<br>     today I have begotten you."<br>  ESV|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

The phrase "only begotten" translates the Greek word monogenes. This word is variously translated into English as "only," "one and only," and "only begotten." <br>  <br>  It's this last phrase ("only begotten" used in the KJV, NASB and the NKJV) that causes problems. False teachers have latched onto this phrase to try to prove their false teaching that Jesus Christ isn't God; i.e., that Jesus isn't equal in essence to God as the Second Person of the Trinity. They see the word "begotten" and say that Jesus is a created being because only someone who had a beginning in time can be "begotten." What this fails to note is that "begotten" is an English translation of a Greek word. As such, we have to look at the original meaning of the Greek word, not transfer English meanings into the text.<br>  <br>  So what does monogenes mean? According to the Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature (BAGD, 3rd Edition), monogenes has two primary definitions. The first definition is "pertaining to being the only one of its kind within a specific relationship." This is the meaning attached to its use in Hebrews 11:17 when the writer refers to Isaac as Abraham's "only begotten son." Abraham had more than one son, but Isaac was the only son he had by Sarah and the only son of the covenant. <br>  <br>  The second definition is "pertaining to being the only one of its kind or class, unique in kind." This is the meaning that is implied in John 3:16. In fact, John is the only New Testament writer who uses this word in reference to Jesus (see John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). John was primarily concerned with demonstrating that Jesus was the Son of God (John 20:31), and he uses this word to highlight Jesus as uniquely God's Son—sharing the same divine nature as God—as opposed to believers who are God's sons and daughters through faith.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that terms such as "Father" and "Son," that are descriptive of God and Jesus, are human terms used to help us understand the relationship between the different Persons of the Trinity. If you can understand the relationship between a human father and a human son, then you can understand, in part, the relationship between the First and Second Persons of the Trinity. The analogy breaks down if you try to take it too far and teach, as some Christian cults (such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses), that Jesus was literally "begotten" as in “produced” or “created” by God the Father.|`|RyhluHk3aa	Christ was begotten of a woman, by the Holy Ghost.

Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|3F6brF2xaa	come fill my world<br>  purify ur people<br>  the steadfast love of Lord<br>  one thing<br>  <br>  just try to listen of this songs  lyrics... fairly nice|`|rbqvDZyxaa	i can only imagaine by mercy me.

I worked with a devout Christian that I have no doubt would have run me down trying to get out if there had been a fire, but she acted so superior to me because she went to one church function or another every day of the week.

Hell is inside and heaven is there too.<br>  The Bible and other spiritual documents teach us how we can adjust our inner qualities to match the stages they talk about, and thus climbing the ladder from "Hell" to "Heaven".<br>  When we have reached a certain degree we will understand how to read these books, but until then we should just accept, that they do not describe actual events or characters.<br>  I hope it helps to remove your confusion, if you need more information here are some links below that could help.<br>  All the best.|`|b8e321f3ad0d1eae90c1058863af7856aa	bible says that heaven is above the earth<br>  <br>  and also speaks of the earth as a footstool for Jesus feet<br>  <br>  Use of the name Jehovah also distinguishes God from the one called “my Lord” at Psalm 110:1, where one rendition is: “The LORD [Hebrew, ]???? said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.” (King James Version) Acknowledging the occurrence of God’s name here in the Hebrew text, the New World Translation reads: “The utterance of Jehovah to my Lord is: ‘Sit at my right hand until I place your enemies as a stool for your feet.’” Those words of Jehovah God refer prophetically to Jesus Christ, whom the writer called “my Lord.”<br>  <br>  when the heavens were cleansed the devil and his wicked angels were hurled out of heaven and down to the earth.<br>  <br>  Sheol, hades, and hell are the common grave of mankind...Job, who was God's friend was tested by Satan and Job had come to his breaking point but before going against God he begged God to just let him die and be remembered in the resurection.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	Yonah was in the belly of a great fish for 3 days and 3 nights just as Messiah Yeshua was in the tomb (the belly of the earth). <br>  Heaven is the restored earth- back to the "garden of eden" state that it was when it was perfect. We will be here, in glorified bodies, reigning with the Messiah. <br>  Hell is to stay asleep in the dirt (buried in the ground) and never awake to be with Messiah.<br>  There are many parallels in scripture- when G-d rescued His people from egypt- they trekked for 3 days and 3 nights before emerging on the other side of the red sea, free from slavery and persecution.<br>  This is a picture of what Messiah would later do for us!|`|9PoGLVmXaa	Heaven is actually on a new earth.
2bC0dvPKaa	You can't make huge generalizations like that. Some people do fear Satan more, but others have a greater love for God. I believe that most Christians love God more than they fear, Satan, though. It's that way in my case, and with most of the people I know.|`|88fe0e7dd70efba47ddc995964dd5cb8aa	These are both interesting questions.<br>  <br>  I would answer no to both questions. God's love is amazing. If there were no afterlife, I would still live enjoying His love. The power of God is above all.<br>  <br>  A funny thing is that I have friends that are Budhist, Muslim, Atheist, etc. and they all respect the genuineness of my Christian faith. For me, I know that God helps me to be a loving friend. I respect how my friends treat other people.

The only real way to prove it would be to take all christian literature and compare how often they mention God and how often they mention Satan. Although I haven't done this myself, just what what I have read (my a grad student of Medieval and Classical studies, so my life is reading) I can tell you Christians wrote far more about God. Really, its amazing how little is written about hell or Satan. In fact, almost all of what we "know" about hell or Satan isn't from the Bible or theologians, most of it comes from Dante Alighieri who wrote satire. <br>  <br>  I will admit, modern fundamentalist Christianity seems to talk a lot about hell and Satan, but they are just a loud minority. In the Catholic Church, its pretty rare to talk about hell or Satan, and it would only be because of a specific Biblical passage.|`|RJRantBfaa	Interesting, if pointed, question.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal -- at least in MY faith path.<br>  <br>  God is not a god of negative reinforcement. Never was. <br>  <br>  Which, means, yep, I know.... there's issues with the Bible. But, one can not escape the illogic of a an unconditionally loving God and lots of whats in the Bible. <br>  <br>  I do not believe that God's love is conditional... which is how its portrayed in the OT.<br>  <br>  So... EITHER, <br>  <br>  The Bible (rather, those pertinent parts) is correct and God loves conditionally (which I can not believe in the slightest).<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  God loves unconditionally and parts of the Bible that describe God differently are wrong.<br>  <br>  Christianity has really got itself wrapped around the axle. <br>  <br>  By some standards I'm screwed.... I'm going to hell. But I tell you with a big loud voice, that this Christian doesn't worship a God who loves conditionally.<br>  <br>  Perhaps some other folks worship some other God....I dunno.....<br>  <br>  <sigh><br>  <br>  enjoy your weekend|`|2h8tqOeFaa	There is not one Christian that fears Satan, Satan cannot harm anyone he cannot hurt anyone but he has influenced many and that's where his strength are, but God on the other hand loves you and always will, so i love him right back..|`|AA11124121	and who can fight something that has influenced itself in man?<br>  <br>  also, that is an assumption that is untrue.|`|44cd283169fb972cb9a8006a9ecce2d1aa	Young Lady,<br>  I had a near-death experience and believe that I found GOD as a result.

Since the earth gets plenty of energy from the sun, it doesn't apply in our local system.<br>  <br>  Think of a "perpetual motion machine" -- it's impossible to make one, because there will *always* be some loss of energy (entropy) from friction, conversion of energy from one type to another (where the losses are usually in the form of heat), etc.  But you *can* make one if you allow just the tiniest bit of energy to be input to the system now and then...<br>  Same thing with earth.

Scientific Creationism, Green Forest, AR: Master Books, pp. 38-46.<br>  Response:<br>  <br>     1. The second law of thermodynamics says no such thing. It says that heat will not spontaneously flow from a colder body to a warmer one or, equivalently, that total entropy (a measure of useful energy) in a closed system will not decrease. This does not prevent increasing order because<br>  <br>            * the earth is not a closed system; sunlight (with low entropy) shines on it and heat (with higher entropy) radiates off. This flow of energy, and the change in entropy that accompanies it, can and will power local decreases in entropy on earth.<br>            * entropy is not the same as disorder. Sometimes the two correspond, but sometimes order increases as entropy increases. (Aranda-Espinoza et al. 1999; Kestenbaum 1998) Entropy can even be used to produce order, such as in the sorting of molecules by size (Han and Craighead 2000).<br>            * even in a closed system, pockets of lower entropy can form if they are offset by increased entropy elsewhere in the system. <br>        In short, order from disorder happens on earth all the time.<br>  <br>     2. The only processes necessary for evolution to occur are reproduction, heritable variation, and selection. All of these are seen to happen all the time, so, obviously, no physical laws are preventing them. In fact, connections between evolution and entropy have been studied in depth, and never to the detriment of evolution (Demetrius 2000).<br>  <br>        Several scientists have proposed that evolution and the origin of life is driven by entropy (McShea 1998). Some see the information content of organisms subject to diversification according to the second law (Brooks and Wiley 1988), so organisms diversify to fill empty niches much as a gas expands to fill an empty container. Others propose that highly ordered complex systems emerge and evolve to dissipate energy (and increase overall entropy) more efficiently (Schneider and Kay 1994).<br>  <br>     3. Creationists themselves admit that increasing order is possible. They introduce fictional exceptions to the law to account for it.<br>  <br>     4. Creationists themselves make claims that directly contradict their claims about the second law of thermodynamics, such as hydrological sorting of fossils during the Flood.|`|ozqYakRpaa	Earth is an open system receiving a constant supply of energy inputs from the sun.

hYQTOabRaa	* Why was it necessary for the ransom to be provided in the manner that it was in order order for us to have eternal life?<br>   - Romans 5:12  "through one man sin entered into the world and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned"  No matter how uprightly we might live, all of us are sinners from birth. (Psalms 51:5) <br>   - Romans 6:23  "The wages sin pays is death."<br>   - Psalms 49:6-9  "Those who are trusting in their means of maintenance, And who keep boasting about the abundance of their riches, Not one of them can by any means redeem even a brother,<br>  Nor give to God a ransom for him; (And the redemption price of their soul is so precious that it has ceased to time indefinite).  That he should still live forever [and] not see the pit."  O.K., so that scripture is a little hard to read but what it is saying is thatno perfect imperfect human can provide the means to deliver someone else from sin and death.  His money cannot buy eternal life, and his soul laid down in death, being the wages that are to come to hin amyway because of sin, has no value to save anyone.)<br>  <br>  * Why did God not simply decree that , although Adam and Eve must die for their rebellion, all of their offspring who would obey God could live forever?<br>   - Because Jehoveh is "a lover of righteousness and justice." (Psalms 33:5; Deuteronomy 32:4; Jeremiah9:24)  So, the way he dealt withthe situation upheld his righteousness, met teh demands of absolute justice, and, at the same time, magnified his love and mercy.  How is that so?<br>  (1) Adam and Eve hed produced no children before they sinned, so none were born perfect.  All of Adam's offspring were brought forth in sin, and sin leads to death.  If Jehovah had simply ignored this, that would have been a denial of his own righteous standards.  God could not do that and so become a party of unrighteousness.  He did not sidestep the requirements of absolute justice; so no intelligent creature could ever legitimately find fault in this respect. - Romans 3:21-26.<br>  (2) Without ignoring the requirements of justice, how could provision be made to deliver those of Adam's offspring who would demonstrate loving obedience to Jehovah?  If a perfect human was to die sacrificially, justice could allow for that perfect life to provide a covering for the sins of those who would in faith excetpt the provision.  Since one man's sin (that of Adam) had been responsible for causing the entire human family to be sinners, the shed blood of another perfect human (in effect, a second Adam), being of corresponding value, could balance the scales of justice.  Because Adam was a willful sinner, he could not benefit; but because the penalty that all mankind was due to pay for sin would in this way be paid by someone else, Adam's offspring could be delivered.  But there was no such perfect human.  Humankind could never meet those demands of absolute justice.  So, as an expression of marvelous love and at great personal cost, jehovah himself made the provision.  (1 Corinthians 15:45; 1 Timothy 2:5,6; John 3:16; Romans 5:8)  God's only-begotten Son was willing to do his part.  Humbly leaving behind his heavenly glory and becoming a perfect human, Jesus died on behalf of mankind. - Philipppians 2:7,8<br>  <br>  ILLUSTRATION: A family head may become a criminla and be sentanced to death.  His children may be left destitute, hopelessly in debt.  Perhaps their kindly grandfather intervenes on their behalf, making provision through a son who is living with him to pay their debts and to open up for them the possibility of a new life.  Of course, to benefit, the children must accept the arrangement, and the grandfather may reasonably require certain things as assurnace that the children will not imitate the course of their father.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more about what the bible says about our future and when we will be relieved of the suffering we are all facing right now in this time of so much heartache caused by financial struggling, violence, famine, disease, natural disasters, etc.  email me from my profile.|`|jOPUBmlJaa	Why do the good guys beat the bad guys in movies?

vqdNEtYPaa	Religion was used to explain things early man could not understand.  Why does the Earth shake?  What is lightning?  They did not have written language until about 4000 BCE so science was right out.  The first religions didn't even believe in an afterlife.  That left people feeling despondent.  Their lives were very hard and there was a lot of cruelty.  So believing that this is it, was depressing to them.  After a while, the concepts of heavens, hells, and eternal life were added.  <br>  <br>  At first they created all sorts of god/goddesses to explain why everything happened.  Over time some things became more obvious and a god was no longer needed to explain it.  As humankind has developed knowledge we have needed deities less and less to explain things.  These days gods explain how the universe began, where humans came from, and what happens after death.  Notice the pattern?  These are the things we still can't explain with scientific evidence.|`|AA11232725	Scientists do a great job when it comes to describing what we can investigate in this present world and apply to development of new technologies. When they try to explain the past they often do a poor job because scientists are just human beings like the rest of us and having a degree or degrees doesn't give you supernatural insight into events that no one was around to see and document.<br>  <br>  So basically scientists are coming up with their best scientific guesses about the origins of life on this planet and how life today reached it's current state. When you read the articles that support evolutionary theory they are full of key words like "could" or "might" or phrases like "it is reasonable to infer that".<br>  <br>  What do those words really mean?<br>  <br>  What they mean is the same as you or I saying "I don't know for sure. Here is my best guess after I spent a lot of time trying to figure it out."<br>  <br>  So you have two main competing "theories" if that's what you want to call them. One says that everything that we see is the result of natural forces operating over long periods of time that allowed events that are extremely unlikely to have occurred to come to pass because given enough time "anything" is possible.<br>  <br>  The other idea says that information (DNA codes) could never have arisen by chance because we never see information coming from natural forces. By it's very nature, information has to mean somthing to someone. The computer codes only cause a computer to perform different functions because the designers made chips that would do what those codes told them to do. Computer code is just a series of numbers, ones and zeros, and they don't mean a thing unless they are used in an application on a computer designed to "understand" and operate on them.<br>  <br>  Then you look at the DNA in a single cell and see the marvelous microbiological "machinery' in operation and it becomes ludicrous to imagine that all of this was the result of accidents achieving lucky breaks with natural selection canceling out all of the mistakes along the way.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.khouse.org/articles/2000/256/" rel="nofollow">http://www.khouse.org/articles/2000/256/</a><br>  <br>  Darwinists love to postulate the "simple cell."

The system design exploits artificial languages and decoding systems, memory banks for information storage, elegant control systems regulating the automated assembly of components, error correction techniques and proofreading devices for quality control.<br>  <br>  All by chance?

The odds that an average protein molecule forms by chance have been calculated as “1 in 10950, a figure that far exceeds human imagination. In mathematical terms, <br>  this figure represents a probability of “zero.”<br>  <br>  (2) There is not a single intermediate fossil…<br>  <br>  Although some 100 million fossils belonging to 250,000 separate species have to date been unearthed, not one supports Darwinism. All the fossils discovered belong to fully formed and complete life forms. However, if evolutionists’ claims were true then a great many out of so many fossils should belong to “intermediate life forms,” but not a single one actually does.<br>  <br>  <br>  (3) “Living fossils” are a response to evolutionary myths...<br>  <br>  Living fossils are proofs that refute the theory of evolution’s claim of “gradual development” in a particularly striking way. The reason why these are known as “living fossils” is that despite being hundreds of millions of years old, they are identical to specimens living today. There are living fossils belonging to a great many species, from ants to trees, and from bats to sharks. This represents definitive documentation that evolution never happened in natural history.<br>  <br>  <br>  (4) The unimaginable information in DNA…<br>  <br>  The information regarding all a person’s characteristics, from their physical appearance to the structure of their internal organs, is recorded in a special coding system inside DNA. If we were to put down this genetic information in DNA on paper, we would have to construct a giant library of 900 volumes containing 500 pages each. This unimaginable quantity of information is encoded in the parts of DNA known as “genes.” It is an absolute fact that DNA cannot form by chance.<br>  <br>  <br>  (5) Organs with irreducible complexity...<br>  <br>  Irreducible complexity is a feature that invalidates the claim of gradual development lying at the heart of the theory of evolution. For example, eyes and wings possess irreducible complexity. It is impossible for the structures such as the tear gland, retina and iris, that together comprise the eye, to come into being individually in stages. That is because sight will only take place when all the components making up the eye are present and fully formed. The same thing applies to the wing.<br>  <br>  <br>  (6) All the variety of life on Earth appeared suddenly 530 million years ago...<br>  <br>  Nearly all the phyla (Mollusca, Chordata and similar categories) emerged in the Cambrian Period, 530 million years ago. Only one or two phyla existed in the Pre-Cambrian, whereas more than 50 emerged suddenly in the Cambrian in various regions of the world. Pre-Cambrian life forms had only very simple bodily forms, while those from the Cambrian were incomparably complex. For example, there is no difference between the eye of the trilobite, a life form that emerged in the Cambrian, and the eyes of present-day life forms.<br>  <br>  <br>  (7) Reptiles are not the ancestors of birds...<br>  <br>  Evolutionists are no longer able to point to Archaeopteryx as an intermediate form between reptiles and birds. Investigations of fossils have shown that the creature is not a transitional form, but rather an extinct species of bird with slightly different characteristics to those of present-day birds. The presence of a breastbone (sternum) proving it had powerful flight muscles and an asymmetrical feather structure identical to that in present-day birds show that this animal was able to fly perfectly well.<br>  <br>  <br>  (8) Fish did not move onto the land...<br>  <br>  Evolutionists once used to point to the coelacanth as evidence for the myth of a transition from water to dry land. It was thought that the coelacanth was an intermediate life form between fish and amphibians. However, a “living” coelacanth was caught in the Indian Ocean in 1938. More than 200 other specimens have been caught to date. Analysis of living coelacanths has revealed that the animal is a flawless fish, and that all the previous conjecture based on fossil remains is completely false.<br>  <br>  <br>  (9) Mutations cannot form new species...<br>  <br>  Mutations are breakages and dislocations, caused by radiation or chemical effects, in the DNA molecule located in the nucleus of the living cell and that carries genetic information. DNA has a highly complex structure. For that reason, any random change arising in this molecule can only damage it. Mutations usually lead to irreparable damage, deformity and even death. People subjected to the tragedies of Hiroshima, Nagasaki or Chernobyl are living indications of this. The claim that mutations are an evolutionary mechanism is proof of the dilemma facing the theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  <br>  (10) Natural selection cannot lead to evolution…<br>  <br>  Natural selection means the survival of strong individuals best fitted to environmental conditions. But this does not give rise to new species. Fo

Unfortunately some of us do.<br>   <br>  We do find some things Christians say rather insulting.

(God in the flesh)<br>  <br>  Acts 2:38 (baptism)|`|fxHEZGcCaa	Greetings,<br>  <br>  There is only verse which reads “God manifested in the flesh” at 1Tim.3:16. However, almost all modern translators recognize that this is a spurious insertion and is not part of God’s Word. The word “God” was inserted by Trinitarians in the fourth century after Christ in a desperate attempt to support their doctrine (Rev 22:18,19). Even today Trinitarian scholars and clergy keep their followers ignorant of this fact. Scholars know that in the Alexandrine Codex (Codex A) a later copyist purposely changed the “he” to “God” because the ink does not match the original writer’s.<br>  <br>  Most modern Bibles read “he was manifested in the flesh” meaning God’s son Jesus (See NWT, NIV, ASV, NASV, NAB, NRSV). In fact, nearly all the ancient manuscripts and all the versions, including the Latin Vulgate, have in their text “he” instead of “God.” Notice what Bible scholars affirm:<br>  <br>  "As in the case of 1JN. 5:7, the evidence of interpolation is overwhelming."—M.S. Terry; Biblical Hermeneutics<br>  <br>  "Reliance [to prove the trinity] it is held by many competent critics, is not to be placed upon the passages in Ac. 20:28 and 1Tim. 3:16. And 1Jn. 5:7 is commonly regarded as spurius."—Unger's Bible Dictionary; 118b<br>  <br>  "No uncial earlier than the eighth or ninth century....supports theos, all ancient versions presuppose [he] and no patristic writer prior to the last third of the fourth century testifies to the reading [theos]."—Bruce M. Metzger, Textual Commentary on the Greek New Testament<br>  <br>  Even Sir Isaac Newton commented on this scripture and demonstrated how the word "God" was inserted to make the phrase read "God was manifest in the flesh" by a small alteration in the Greek text. Isaac Newton proved that whenever early Church writers cited this verse they never used the spurious reading. In fact, this verse was not even used by Trinitarians to combat Arius which shows that it did not come into the text until after the fourth century.<br>  (An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture, by Sir Isaac Newton)<br>  <br>  We can be confident that the reading “he [Jesus] was manifested in the flesh” is the original because it is in agreement with the rest of the Scriptures. It is always God’s son who became flesh not God himself (1Jn. 2:22; 4:2-3; 2Jn. 7; Jn. 8:42). If the fabricated reading were allowed to remain, it would cause a contradiction in God’s Word since John 1:18; 5:37; 6:46, and 1 John 4:12 explicitly states that "No man has seen God at any time." The scriptures show that God could not literally become flesh (Num. 23:19; 1Sam. 15:29; Hos. 11:9).<br>  <br>  It is true that Jesus “manifested” God, however, there is no mystical Trinitarianism involved. The Scriptures are clear that Jesus “showed” us God because he taught and demonstrated by example what God was like. John made this clear when he said: "No one has seen God, but His only-begotten son has made Him known" (Jn.1:18). Just as a son resembles his father Jesus showed us what his father was like. He was God's foremost representative because he perfectly reflected his Father's qualities and teaching.<br>  <br>  Even the verses which state that Jesus revealed God show that Jesus was less than God. Mat.11:27 and Lk.10:22 say that Jesus “reveals” God to us but it makes it clear that he had to receive his power and authority. Jn.5:36,37 says that Jesus bears witness regarding God, yet he was “assigned,” “dispatched” and “sent” by God. These are terms fitting a servant but could never be said of Almighty God since the one sent is less than the sender (Jn.13:16). The son only imitates his father and cannot do anything on his own (Jn 5:19; 8:28).<br>  <br>  (As a side note, any Trinitarian who uses Jn.10:30 or Jn.14:9 is not thinking or he is ignorant of his own belief since according to the trinity the son and the Father can not be one!  Such an interpretation would actually prove Sebellianism or Modalism; a heresy to Trinitarians.)<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, since Jesus perfectly reflected all the attributes and qualities of the invisible God to mankind he was the "reflection of," or "image of" the invisible God (Col. 1:15; Heb 1:3). The word translated "image" is "eikon" and means the "reflection of," “not the original.” He was not God who is invisible.<br>  <br>  So the context of Scripture always contradicts Trinitarian interpretation. The bible repeatedly shows that Jesus could not be equal to Almighty God. Jesus had a God over him before he came to earth and after he returned to heaven (Mic.5:4; Jn.20:17; Rom.15:6; Rev.3:12). Jesus had to receive his power (Jn. 5:22,25,26; 17:2; 3:35). Explicit scriptures show that Jesus was less than Almighty God at every point of his existence (Mk.13:32; 1Cor.15:27,28). At the highest position he will ever attain, Jesus is still "subject" to *GOD* the same way we are "subject" to him.<br>  <br>  It's is very significant that nearly every spurious addition to the Scriptures has been by Trinitarians. Corrupting God’s inspired Word in this way elicits God’s strongest condemnation (Rev. 22:18,19). How can someone who is under this curse be trusted to teach the truth about anything? The fact is that most modern Bible translators of every religious persuasion have recognized these verses as fake and do not include them in their version. Yet, many priests and ministers still deceive their flocks by referring to them and use faulty translations which include them. This is because there is not one clear verse in the whole bible that supports the teaching that Jesus is equal to Almighty God.<br>  <br>  Yours,<br>  <br>  Ron Rhoades|`|6w1e6zUVaa	I can't help you, but no matter what you show them from YOUR bible it doesn't mean they'll agree.  Because they can just as easily show you something from THEIRS that contradicts what you think.

Every parent loves their kids but the principles found in the Bible makes it really hard on him.<br>  <br>  (1 Corinthians 7:9) ...Marry…only in [the] Lord.<br>  <br>  (Matt 12:30)  He that is not on my side is against me, and he that does not gather with me scatters.<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 7:3) And you must form no marriage alliance with them. Your daughter you must not give to his son, and his daughter you must not take for your son.<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 7:4) For he will turn your son from following me, and they will certainly serve other gods; and Jehovah’s anger will indeed blaze against YOU, and he will certainly annihilate you in a hurry.<br>  <br>  (Nehemiah 13:25) And I began to find fault with them and call down evil upon them and strike some men of them and pull out their hair and make them swear by God: “YOU should not give YOUR daughters to their sons, and YOU should not accept any of their daughters for YOUR sons or yourselves.<br>  <br>  (2 Corinthians 6:14) Do not become unevenly yoked with unbelievers. For what fellowship do righteousness and lawlessness have? Or what sharing does light have with darkness?<br>  <br>  (Matt 10:37) He that has greater affection for father or mother than for me is not worthy of me; and he that has greater affection for son or daughter than for me is not worthy of me. <br>  <br>  I understand your love for your fiance and his dad.

If it is a legal document and is done in accordance with the law it is ok.<br>  If they are Jehovah's Witnesses that are disfellowshipped or publicly reproved or are just not in good standing the elder would not want to be a part of your ceremony.<br>  <br>  But it is a conscience matter.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	this is a very interesting question<br>  <br>  well i think it would all depend on what he thinks, and what he, and you want to say, or do at this wedding, i don't see a reason why not, personally. <br>  <br>  but i think at the end of the day, it's up to him

The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. - Galatians 2:20 <br>  <br>  Know therefore that the LORD your God is God; he is the faithful God, keeping his covenant of love to a thousand generations of those who love him and keep his commands. - Deuteronomy 7:9 <br>  <br>  For the LORD loves the just and will not forsake his faithful ones. . . - Psalm 37:28 <br>  <br>  I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me. - Proverbs 8:17 <br>  <br>  This is how God showed his love among us: He sent his one and only Son into the world that we might live through him. This is love: not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as an atoning sacrifice for our sins.

The one thing I remember most of all in that house was the cold hatred everyone seemed to have for everyone else.  Although I was just a child, I remember feeling a bottomless sorrow.<br>  <br>  When I became born again, I began praying for my father.  I prayed for him for 10 years.  Four days before he passed away, he accepted Jesus Christ as his savior.  After he died, God did something incredible.  He transformed the way I perceived my past.  I saw that it was all leading to that day, when Jesus made the way for my father to accept the cross.  It changed everything.  All the difficult years didn't matter anymore, because my father was saved and I will see him, and join him, in eternity one day.  As God promised, He had worked everything together for good.<br>  <br>  The only power on earth able to change things is Jesus Christ.

It sounds to me like you are on the verge of a break through. <br>  My only advice would be to draw near to God through prayer and spend a little time in the Word daily. <br>  There is no reason you can't be as knowledgable and transformed as the most "spiritual" people you have tried to rely on in the past. <br>  Thislife is a journey with Christ and he wants you whole spiritually, mentally, physically and financially.   But...none of it will be "easy" and will require hard work and patience and the willingness to change behaviors.  (I say that because I'm living through this now. )<br>  I would say the biggest thing is to not panic and to continue to pray and read Scripture and pray for wisdom. <br>  Personally, I've gone from a fear driven ,all is lost , give up way of thinking to a limited  outlook from Gods perspective where I've found that this life is so limited and God has this world in his control. <br>  Remember if you are a believer you are an heir withChrist. <br>  Sister, listen for the holy spirits council in prayer and begin to accept the beautiful transformation in your life. <br>  It won't happen over night, but He who began a good work in you will be faithful to complete it. <br>  Fight the good fight sister.|`|AypSdbwzaa	I spent 17 years in prison, like you, very much alone.

At one point in time everyone that I loved has let me down and left me alone. The turning point in my life was when I was 18 I had an unplanned pregnancy and because of my bad judgment and selfish reasons I has an abortion. I felt horrible after that I just killed my own child and thought I would never recover. I went into a deep depression and didn't have the energy to even clean my house or take a shower. I know gross right. That is when I turned my life to God and put my faith into Jesus. Believing that he died for my sins so I may be forgiven. God change my life and I have never been happier. Though I must admit God has never "spoken" to me I can feel His love and guidance in my heart and I know He is there. God has brought me a wonderful husband and two beautiful children and I thank Him everyday that He loved me enough to send Jesus for me and change my life. Give your life to God and He will meet your needs and take care of you the way all loving parents take care of their children only BETTER. My prayers are with you and I am sorry for your loss.

White racism has been demonstrated to be thorough and brutal. Around the world for over 500 years, non-whites have suffered white racism which seems to have been predicated by white pride and superiority.<br>   <br>  When people remember American slavery,  the Jewish holocaust and South African apartheid, then see any white claiming of pride,  they imagine a bloody history starting over again.<br>  <br>  For the people that continue to suffer white racism everyday of their lives, your ranting would seem ignorant if not racist. Theirs is a life and history of oppression and exclusion, yours is largely one of privilege.<br>  To put it simply, white pride to them means "we intend to oppress and exclude you, and everyone you love sometime soon, so hang tight and enjoy the good times."<br>  <br>  Race relations seem better today, but history takes too long to fade away. Oppressed people's sensitivity lasts for just as long. Say something critical about Israel and you might just be seen as Anti-Semitic. Treat a Black person badly and you might be seen as Racist. My advice is know the history and just be smart about your discretion.<br>  <br>  If everybody could just think a little deeper and harder about how we treat each other, then we could each happily claim pride in our cultures, ancestries, and histories without fear or favor.|`|npTZTzWRaa	I know that plenty of white people are racist and thet racism has had widespread longterm and long lasting negative effects on blacks in America and not whites, if any race in America benefits from rapid racism its white people<br>  <br>  I am too aware of black history and have seen too many racist whites to draw any other conclusion, also its hard to comprehend why they are so racist when in actuality we are the ones who suffer from racism in this country, not the other way around<br>  <br>  Not to mention white racism is highly ignored, and taken too lightly in this country which has always been the case since slavery but is still the case to a lesser degree today|`|8fyEZtyNaa	blame history. your ancestors, your grandparents whatever, are the ones that caused this.<br>  <br>  that is what happens when you oppress a group, it comes back to bite you in the butt.<br>  <br>  history shows its the generations that follow that suffer.|`|Jucak0HLaa	That's exactly what I think!!!It's like everytime they get in trouble,it's only bec they're black,but it's their fault they did it.And like with the paper thing you did,they're separating us out,and I think that's racist!!!Lol...Yeah,at school I got called a greedy racist bec I don't like Obama,and the boy is white!<br>  <br>  <br>  See the world:So are you telling me that if I called you the n word,you wouldn't be offended?|`|ncdTxID9aa	I think society accepts Whites being in the hot seat when it comes to racism and acknowledging other races who have come up in history.  It's not wrong to socially adjust to different races of people who in history had little positive relationships with whites or other nations, but I think people got comfortable with double standards.  Not all of what people consider a double standard is that but there are times where you can debate certain topics on race and racism. And for some reason some people hate for racism to no pertain to whites. But it's good to know smarter people aren't that biased.|`|da4zS4AOaa	How many times have you encountered a black racist?<br>  <br>  The paper filling thing well most Blacks in America shouldn't really be called African Americans since they weren't born in Africa in the first place or Asian Americans.

XN0cYCATaa	The only way to escape the righteous judgment of God is to trust in the provision He has made.  This provision is found in Jesus.  "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life," (John 3:16).  Jesus is the only way to salvation (John 14:6).  Jesus is also God in flesh (John 1:1,14; Col. 2:9).  Therefore, Jesus' life is of infinite value.  This means that His sacrifice is sufficient to cleanse you of your sins.  It is capable of satisfying the infinitely righteous standard of God that is required to match His infinite holiness.<br>  <br>  Jesus' sacrifice is the only provision acceptable to God the Father.  If you want to escape the eternal judgment of God, you must put your trust in Jesus and what He did on the cross and in nothing else.  Without Him, there is no hope of escape on the Day of Judgment.  How do you do this?  You receive Jesus (John 1:12).  You trust in Him alone.  You can ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins (John 14:14).  Trust Him alone.|`|93aY6WzAaa	No. it's spiritual mathematics. if you can see it the truth is if you are forgiving you will be forgiven. it works like this: you will FEEL forgiven.|`|uK3tkaOJaa	I've done nothing that deserves eternal punishment.

(S)He can't just say "Oh, you're a good guy, I forgive you!" and let you get away with it.<br>  If people sincerely apologize to me, I forgive them. If I did something to offend them, I apologize. Of course, this all depends on what they did to me, but then again my friends and I rarely fight.<br>  Only you can take the blame for what you did, or at least that's my firm belief. Take responsibility for your actions, and do better next time.|`|j471gxhxaa	In the catholic perspective the  forgiveness of sin is not earned. It is gratuitously given by God.  It "does" not have to be given by God because it is there right in front of you. You only have to ask God for forgiveness. Scripture is replete with accounts of Jesus healing people and forgiving their sins. Catholics believe in God's unfathomable mercy  and boundless compassion.|`|GlGjJpJraa	Your punishment for sin is death. Forgiveness come's in the form of eternal life when you repent. You can't compare a silly judicial system to an eternal God.|`|YLW7cEjkaa	The only reason we can be forgiven without punishment is because the price has already been paid for us. Jesus' death was the sacrifice that paid for our sin.|`|dj6FHy15aa	Through the stripes and Christ dieing on the cross I'm save so long as I confess my sins and proclaim him to be savior.|`|AA10574017	Who or what has ever really dictated that life is a test of faith other than the human mind? I percieve that life is a test of conscience and mindfulness rather than faith. All the props and images of faith are not required to experience the spiritual side of existence. <br>  <br>  I can neither deny nor confirm the existence of sin or salvation or God but I do have control over the conscious decisions and my moment-to-moment mindfulness. Whether I find peace and contentment beyond the external or material world is my responsibility. Other people can help guide and encourage us on that path or they can mislead us and convince us to act against our personal convictions. But no one other than the indiviual can truly find his or her way to experience peace of mind, heaven, nirvana or however one wishes to call it. That's free will!<br>  <br>  Despite my doubts about the existence of sin or salvation as an external reality outside our minds, I do not percieve myself to be perfect. Perfection is just a word afterall. Who or what determines the existence of perfection? <br>  <br>  When people ask if I'm spiritual and I tell them yes, they automatically assume that I hold strong feelings for Christianity. I believe that all doctrines like anything else in this seemingly dualistic existence hold truth and wisdom but I also believe that certain explanations from scriptures were and are based on man's understanding so I can never fully commit to any one interpretation. Similar truth and wisdom is also not secluded to only one culture, people, region, or time period and have been experienced and expressed by others from various walks of life. <br>  <br>  I personally believe that the writers of scripture and most of the time their followers like to dress God up in their favorite outfit with consulting God. Yet, outside the realm of man's words God, Brahman, Yaweh, Allah, the Dao, or however one wishes to refer to the permeating oneness of the universe, has already written his/hers/its history and existence in the creation of the universe for us to know and experience.<br>  <br>  I never get personally offended by people's beliefs or and in today's world there are so many people, who express offense to other people's beliefs. This happens on both sides but both claim to be victims of religious or spiritual discrimination. Many Christians complain when someone espresses their discomfort with religious hegemony in public squares and likewise many atheists complain if Christians or others practice their beliefs in public such as praying. Both of these arguements are pointless and only create tension between both parties. What people choose to deny is that this is a self-sustaining cycle. It's like two men wrestling on a bridge: the closer Man-A pushes Man-B to the edge of the bridge behind him, the stronger and more forceful Man-B will respond to keep himself from being pushed off the bridge and vice versa. <br>  <br>  We see this every day in society: Conservatives Vs. Liberals, Republicans Vs. Democrats, Christians Vs. Atheists, Fox News Vs. MSNBC, the NRA Vs. PETA and so  on until almost no one can see the middle ground which is the only reality outside people's imaginations and fantacies. They all fail to see that they are just a bunch of fundamentalists living in a neutral world.<br>  <br>  I percieve that the multitude of words that have remained in our minds and our scriptures throughout known history such as sin, salvation, heaven, hell, divinity, perfection, prophecy, good vs. evil, etc. may have a segregating effect on universal truth and spiritual well-being.<br>  <br>  I also believe there's a philosophical and conscious problem with "doubt" as the only grounds for eternal punishment according to scripture. I have known many devout people, who have not found contentment and peace... I can't help but believe that their lack of peace is somehow related to their level of devotion. It's happened before throughout history and continues to happen today. I like to think that among the faithful and self-righteous, there was some level of conscience and guilt during to Salem witch burnings, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, colonial occupation, slavery, 9/11, and so on, for essentially killing innocent human beings. I know that the faithful do not agree with groups considered occultic but whether they like it or not,  these acts were committed through the mindset of occultism.<br>  <br>  I believe that there is more reward for the mindful than the faithful but perhaps it's because no reward is sought after.   <br>  <br>  And I disagree with the last statement that says no one is good. We are all both good and evil because it only exists in man's intentions and we experience that on a daily basis also. People can never be only one otherwise we would be non-existant. It's like male without female or organisms without plant life. They could not exist otherwise.|`|RoqxGbgRaa	the apostle paul wrote that "all have sinned and come short of the glory of God."  <br>  <br>  for christians, forgiveness from God is not a matter of earning it, but of sincerely desiring it and asking for it.  john wrote that when we confess our sins, God forgives us and cleanses us of all unrighteousness.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	A person is forgiven their sin if they confess they are a sinner before God and believe in His son, Jesus Christ, who died on a cross to pay all the penalty for our sins.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Your religion has nothing to do with justice.   It says that you can get away with mass murder if you tell God you're really, really sorry and pray the sinner's prayer.  On the other hand your God supposedly gives nonbelivers eternal punishment for minor infractions.  <br>  <br>  That is not in any way, shape or form "justice."|`|ibAJ0YiMaa	You get forgiveness from God. You can't earn it. You forgive others because God forgave you. God sent his son to die for our sins.

That way you're advertising without having to say anything.|`|a1hevOG2aa	They do that because its hard to tell, and if you assume you could end up offending someone.  You really dont need to worry about it that much, people will pick up on it whether you change how you dress or what not.  Somethin you can do is maybe wear some rainbow stuff, like a bracelet or sweater.  Also, talk about it freely, dont jam it in peoples faces (cuz thats annoying), but when your with friends and you see an attractive girl turn to your friend say something like "damn! did you see her? very sexy." usually works with guy friends, lol.  After a while, and after you're out for a while, your network of people that you know will all know anyways, so yeah, dont worry bout it too much.|`|bkH9ODR6aa	Well they're not going to go straight upto you because they are too scared themselves that you won't be interested or you're either not bisexual.

I think the best way is to go to clubs in your area because you're not likely to find a date here and there. It's annoying being bi sometimes because I don't know where to look for a female partner like you. BUT. I would suggest that you make your sexuality more open.

03f8630c3eff0957c888c99030a27054aa	Nudists are misunderstood because of differing agendas. There are nudists that adhere to the historic German FKK free clothing culture of non-sexual social nudism. On the opposite end of the spectrum are "lifestyle" nudists who are open swingers. Here in the U.S. many current nudists found roots in the sexually liberating 1960s, and as a result when you visit many nudist resorts the average age is well into the 50s and 60s. That often times leads to the impression nudists are all aging baby boomers.<br>  <br>  As a nudist in my twenties, I am an example of someone who discovered the joys of the nude beach during my undergrad years in UC-Santa Barbara. Once a person overcomes the psychological reticence factor, they'll discover nudism is not the strange perversion they thought it was.|`|ua9GsHMjaa	Too many people just assume nudism is all about sex. To a certain extent, I think people WANT to think that. That's why the stereotype never goes away.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	in the right place and time, i think that is their business! it's not my cup of tea; but, if it works for others, okkkkkkkkkk.|`|da4zS4AOaa	Hihi.<br>  <br>  They're simply just people living their life. I respect them for how confident they are. I would never do what they do I'm not confident enough|`|iCqfmRC3aa	It seems that people love to discriminate against anything or anyone they don't understand.  It used to be people, whether by age, color, creed, nationality or sexual orientation. <br>  <br>  Today, most people acknowledge that discrimination is wrong, and we are a society that is much more tolerant than we once were.  But, you will still see negative comments regarding anything that "they" think is different.<br>  <br>  Nudists are the most friendly, outgoing and honest people you would ever want to meet.<br>  <br>  The average age of a nudist is in the early to mid 50's because that is the age where most reach security in their profession, and their self esteem, to where they feel they can do what they want, without fear it could do some type of harm to them financially or to their career. <br>  <br>  Nudists understand that there are a hundred different body types and none of them are ugly or gross.  We are tolerant, inclusive and non-judgmental.  Wouldn't it be nice if others were also?<br>  <br>  Nudists are not misunderstood, in fact 74% of Americans agree with nudist activities in appropriate settings.  The Federal Government, and quite a few States have official nudists sites that are governed by and staffed with agency personnel.  Over 55 Million Americans freely admit to skinny-dipping (swimming naked) with the opposite sex.  <br>  <br>  So, as you can see, nudists are now main stream.  All of the cruise lines now have nude cruises. <br>  <br>  Your body is natural, clothing is artificial.  <br>  <br>  The ones that complain about nudity, whether it is due to age, sagging body parts or any of the other "complaints' are probably the same ones that make fun of other people for any of a myriad of reasons ... pimple, spilled drink, spot on clothes, not having the "right" shoes or name brand jeans.  They tend to complain about anything they consider "different" or anything they don't think is cool, even if others do.<br>  <br>  I respect their right to prefer clothing, I even respect their right to not want to "look" at people of age, I just wonder why they think they'd feel such a need to check out "saggy" things they consider ugly :-)  I think they may protest to much ;-) <br>  <br>  I notice that some even felt the need to complain about spelling and grammar, but were apparently able to figure out the question.<br>  <br>  I know I prefer well thought out answers.|`|ynCJxyagaa	I think that they are misunderstood owing to their own failure to communicate.

Also you drinking isn't a good idea.  You do know that under-aged drinking is illegal?  You need to seek counseling so you can get the proper help.  Both of you are in trouble with your lives.

My dad recommended he "double bag it".  <br>  <br>  My mom also said that if you ever get a chance to marry somone who had studdied for the priesthood, you would get a good catch.  She was so right!

qvycijbOaa	Na, an alter ego is like your imagination being creative. Bi polar is an illness, you can't make yourself bi polar. Beyonce got Sasha Fierce because she thinks that she changes her persona on stage as a lot of people do.|`|ncdTxID9aa	No, I think the difference with Beyonce, Tyler Perry and Martin Lawrence is that they are entertainers, and that's fine, it entertains.  Now if people use alter egos and find themselves living double lives or being a bit two faced, then that's pretty odd.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	nah..bipolarity assumes you don't have control over it<br>  alter egos are usually something you have control over <br>  <br>  if you don't have control over which mental state you are in, it's bipolar (usually)<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  Peace|`|l7jLuvFeaa	no, GEMINI is a nice word for bipolar

While the clips were entertaining, I found the commentors racist and offensive so I stopped watching it.<br>  <br>  Edit: The whole promotion of the show was racist. Like saying "The only white you're gonna see is Barry." It's just entirely offensive to me. It's like "Oh. Forbid you include a white person for a few seconds." The lack of non-black commentors overall was offensive as well.|`|0hsh000waa	Yes, my husband I are watching reruns now I think it's funny and interesting.

The Antichrist cannot be known about before the 7 year "tribulation", and certainly not before the rapture. Since there is already a huge urban legend about Obama being the Antichrist, he cannot be. That's the whole point. Everyone is supposed to trust him.<br>  <br>  B. He's supposed to be of European/Middle Eastern descent...between the Tigris and Euphrates. Obama was born in Hawaii.|`|VcHxpRTQaa	I don't know what the hell Billy R is talking about but that preacher is probably just angry that Obama won the election and is trying to give him a bad reputation. He is no different than the people who said he was Muslim (not that there is anything wrong with that) and a racist. This preacher is just needs to except the fact that Obama is the president. Don't believe everything you hear.|`|MqCuDV4Naa	No. He is a tool of the Antichrist. He will usher in the one world government. He is not the only one though. Every President since Johnson has played their part. I believe he is the final one. He will in the next 8 years allow the US to become a full blown socialist government. This will allow the true antichrist to move in.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Luke 10:18<br>      He(Jesus) replied,  "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven".<br>  <br>  <br>  A Hebrew the word for "Lightning" is....Baraq<br>  A Hebrew the word for a high place is...Bamah<br>  In Hebrew the word "vau" is a connector word that sounds like the letter "O".<br>  In Hebrew, "Lightning from Heaven" might be translated as Baraq O Bamah.<br>  <br>  Then again this is nothing but a novelty in my opinion.

Wf3CdgJKaa	My friend ... I am 53 gay man I have been out of the closet for longer than I care to remember.. I married my boyfriend of 10 years this past september....and let me tell you PEOPLE are annoying.. a lot of gays get on my last nerve too .. so don't think for one moment that is a rarity.....but that is the way they choose to express themself..so may they be happy...I also think at some point and time every person questions their sexuality if only for a brief second..and as far as whether or not you are or aren't, in the big picture it means much less.. trust me in time you will know... the important thing is to be a good human...as long as you are who you are regardless no matter of a sexual preference you will turn out fine..|`|i8EcDMdZaa	You run around calling everyone a silly goose. You act talk look like a fag You get bummed and like it (Thats proberly the best sign you could ever get)|`|C021mpLLaa	When a guy is at that age and they start liking other boys. Also if they feel slightly feminine.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	Being gay isn't a choice. It's how you are. <br>  <br>  Just think about what you want in life. Down the road, do you see yourself with a man or a woman? In a sexual situation, do you see yourself with a man or a woman? Your ideal romance, man or woman? <br>  <br>  If you are constantly answering 'man,' then you are most likely gay. If you commonly answer 'woman,' you are most likely straight. If you answer both commonly, then you are probably bisexual. <br>  <br>  Being gay isn't something forced upon you that you are unhappy with. It's a wonderful feeling. <br>  <br>  Also, you may not be ready to have a sexuality yet. Take your time. No one's rushing you.|`|g6cUQFuCaa	ok umm...<br>  the u not liking some gay ppl becuz they r annoying<br>  that doesnt have anything to do with their sexuality<br>  that could just be their annoying<br>  same with the sweet thing<br>  and theres nothing wrong with being gay<br>  and u no if ur gay if u feel attraction towards other men|`|x0pqUrrgaa	wear rainbow color and not afraid to show it , guy walks , chick jean are baggy and wear wallets , basily the way they dress or walk or act super super gay|`|gcG1jvbnaa	no one can say that your gay you have to figure it out for yourself.. if you feel an attraction towards males than perhaps you are gay.. if you are afraid to be gay then go for bisexually|`|VVqGQfJYaa	no one has a choice about their sexuality<br>  i think its less to do with genes and more to do with a hormone balance<br>  <br>  you dnt want to be gay becasue of society etc and this will only be overcomed once you've accepted it if u are (im bi but its the same sort of thing - jst not as drastic)<br>  <br>  the only way to know if ur gay is if your attracted to men or not. simple as - there is no way to testing it unless you try a of sexual action from both sexes<br>  <br>  and ur issues with certain gays being annoying is fine becsaue everyone finds people annoying|`|oPYhUi8baa	If you're asking then you probably already know the answer and there's nothing to be ashamed of, embrace it!|`|iwOjydnFaa	Well if it was a choice and you didnt want to be gay then you wouldnt be asking this question would you? =/|`|GaKVvupTaa	Well, you may not agree with me (and certainly have every right not to) but I'll try and give a biblical explination, please at least consider.<br>  <br>  There are no gay genes, and if there are then there are theft genes, murder genes, sexual immorality genes, so on and so fourth. The Lord tells us the sins of the father will have an effect on their children. Heres one example<br>  <br>  (Deuteronomy 5:9) - "You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me,"<br>  <br>  So im inclined to say yes, people are born with a disposition to certain sins. And i've even found this true in my own by now knowing my fathers sins, I have gone down the same path. Not nearly to his extent but to an extent.<br>  <br>  But because we are put in this position doesn't mean we should give into it. Pray about it and you will recieve help.<br>  <br>  Its especially bad now because homosexuality is boarderline "quite alright" in societies eyes, while theft and murder are not. If you were born with the disposition to be a serial killer (and remember, if we have hated someone in our hearts we have committed murder) and the urges to kill were strong, would it be unhealthy to repress those urges conciously? To maintain order in the mind and get rid of these unsavory thoughts? Well, if I were to say the same about homosexuality, to pray to be cleansed of these thoughts, people now would say something like "Thats incredibly unhealthy! Give into sexual urges and let yourself be fulfilled! You only have one life!" or something like it. Terrible, doctrine of demons, doctrine of self love and worship. They have decieved so many.<br>  <br>  I know I probably wont be popular after this post, but I want you guys to know the truth. The stuggle is real but not unknown. Im praying for you!|`|VVwVhnmQaa	Well, I don't know if this will help much, but I can try:<br>  <br>  I first liked a guy when I was only six years old. I never knew there was a word for it (homosexual, gay, etc.) Therefore, I never really went through a phase where I liked girls and then all of a sudden I have these undesirable feelings for men. Try to be your natural self, look inside of you. At first there are many gays and lesbians who don't want to be gay, but like Oliver K said, I'm sure you don't want to be gay more because of you thinking society won't accept you than you won't accept yourself. See, if you are sexually attracted to males, or physically, mentally, emotionally, or romantically, then there's a big chance you might be gay. And always remember: only time wil tell. Don't rush things. And whatever happens, just remember to be yourself. Even if you aren't gay. You wouldn't believe the countless people who deny who they really are and live their lives as a lie. It's not fair to the people around them. And most of all it's not fair to themselves. I don't believe it's a choice. How could I have chosen to be gay at the age of six? I never saw two men together, nor had I ever heard anything about two men being together or even it being possible. I always tell myself: I love being gay and I always will. I just don't like the people who hate me for being gay. But I don't them bother me. I shove them off like a piece salami lol. So, hope I helped abit. If you need any more help, feel free to email me. Blessed be!

No that is not correct. 4 sunnah should be read in 4 rakahs, not in 2's seperatley. By seperatley i mean u do NOT finish prayer completley (saying salam facing your shoulders) then start to make intention/niyaah for new 2 rakahs. <br>  4 sunnah should be read like this- After u have read 2 rakahs & your in the sitting position & have finished reciting 'at-tahiyyatu...'  you stand up and complete the 2 remaining rakahs of your 4 sunnah. Just how you would when you read your usual 4 fard.<br>  I hope Allah (swt) will accept you prayers even if you have made mistakes in your past just pray for  forgiveness insha'Allah. All the best.
hP7edhKYaa	There are 3 types of dreams<br>  <br>  1) From Allah swt.<br>  2) From ur own mind.. i.e random dreams based on stuff thats been on ur mind<br>  3) A dream from shaytaan.. to scare u etc etc *not nice dreams*<br>  <br>  Sayidinah Abu Huraira reported that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said: When the time of Qiyamah gets closer, a believer’s dream can hardly be false. And the truest vision will be of one who is himself the most truthful in speech, for the dream of a Muslim is the forty-fifth part of Prophecy, and dreams are of three types: one good dream which is a sort of good tidings from Allah; the evil dream which causes pain is from the satan; and the third one is a suggestion of one’s own mind; so if any one of you sees a dream which he does not like he should stand tip and offer prayer and he should not relate it to people, and he said: I would love to see fetters, but I dislike wearing of necklace, for the fetters is (an indication of) one’s steadfastness in religion. The narrator said: I do not know whether this is a part of the hadith or the words of Ibn Sirin.<br>  <br>  Muslim: Book 29, Number 5621<br>  <br>  <br>  Sayidinah Qatada reports that Rasulullah (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) said:  Good dreams are from Allah and the evil dreams are from satan. If one sees a dream which one does not like, one should spit on one’s left side and seek the refuge of Allah from the satan; (spitting 3 times means to resemble the gesture of spitting, not actual splitting with a mouthful of saliva. Such a gesture will help that) it (the dream) will not do one any harm, and one should not disclose it to anyone and if one sees a good dream one should feel pleased but should not disclose it to anyone but whom one loves.(In other words, disclose it only to people that are pious, honorable, etc.)<br>  <br>  Muslim: Book 29, Number 5618<br>  <br>  You shudnt share nightmares as they may become true or harm u *as far as I know estaghfurilah if im wrong*<br>  <br>  Also u shudnt have a dream interpreted by others.. esp. jelous people as they may intperpret ur dream in a bad way, casuing harm<br>  <br>  And u shud only share good dreams with the ones U love and people who are not jelous. This is a good example, that when prophet Yusuf asalaam had a dream that there were 11 stars and a moon and sun, which he told his father Yaqub asalaam, his father told him not to tell his brothers as they wud be jelous of him<br>  <br>  ^^ i wasnt sure if i typed it correct so i asked my mate hafli to get me a quote and luckly i was right :P alhamdulilah<br>  <br>  O Father! I dreamt eleven stars, the sun and the moon were prostrating before me. Hazrat Yaqub (a.s.) said: O son, do not tell your dream to your brothers lest they will play some trick with you. Surely Shaitan is an open enemy of humans. Thus, Allah has chosen you..."<br>  (Surah Yusuf: 4, 5 &6)|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Because as male Muslims, we are by nature control freaks, afraid of every thing and every one, and the only way we can cope with the world is to take to the streets with offensive placards.<br>  <br>  Some of us even take out our insecurities by kidnapping non believers<br>  <br>  the real nuts like to kill the unbelievers<br>  <br>  but Woah, wait for it, some of us are so mental we fly planes in to office buildings|`|QcviYozHaa	Peace..<br>  <br>  Bad dreams or 'Nightmares' should not be uttered to anyone becuase if one does, there is a very high chance of it to come true.As a member said in her answer if you saw someone die, it's best not to talk so it won't be a (fall) on the person...<br>  <br>  There are guidelines to these dreams, if u have a dream before fajr or during fajr then this is something which could happen, and something you should avoid and must 'Not' ever say to any1, even to ur best friend, or the one u trust.

They saw so many wonderful miracles yet still turned against him...In fairness to the world I guess he had to be seen to punish those who he had chosen to represent him.  Otherwise he would not have been a very fair god would he.<br>  One example I guess would be no sex before marriage..what a boring old God one would think - but I suspect being God he could see the future and saw that in sleeping with multiple partners society would become as it is today - Aids (now more prevelant in hetrosexuals than homosexuals - all other sexually transmitted diseased - multiple abortions - unmarried Mums - brothers and sisters with different fathers-broken marriages (the grass is always greener etc.) No generation seems to learn from mistakes of the previous generation - in my 'umble opinion the world is getting worse. More wars and unrest now than in any other time.  Parents live in fear - kids seem unable to have the freedom I had as a child because of the fear of child abduction etc. Even the recent economic crisis has been caused by greed - and the 'must have now' society.  Inequality - racism - poverty. So on reflection many of God's laws, if followed would perhaps make the world a far better place to live in.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	I didn't click on the photo, but if your breathing, your doing on credit to God and you owe him a life.<br>  <br>  He brought you into this world and he take you out of it.<br>  <br>  No believers were harmed in the making of this bible|`|mG8kWrTXaa	Sorry, I can't explain why, I just don't get it either.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself.

Bb6fQtl0aa	When I was a teenager going through high school I was tricked by music. Once I started learning more about Allaah, Islaam, and Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, that helped me purify my life from things like music. <br>  <br>  It was difficult at the beginning, but one thing that helped was to stay away from things and places that led to music. And when I started to fast during Ramadhaan, that also made it easier to stay away from music.<br>  <br>  So yes, it was challenging at first, but alhamdulillaah after some time and struggle you look back and feel happy that Allaah helped you leave something bad for His Sake. And also, after some time, inshaa-Allaah you'll be surprised that you ever liked music in the first place.<br>  <br>  One big advice... ask Allaah for help in this.

I've attempted it once or twice, but now I'm choosing the cowardly way out and giving myself more time before I try again. I know some people who did give up though and found it amazingly difficult to begin with and it became easier over time (like most other things). I've noticed the shaytan likes to get in your head when you try something for the first time. Like when I first put on my hijab, that little idiot messed with my mind so much, but over time it became easier. I reckon it's like that with music too. <br>  <br>  What I have also noticed is a lot of people give up but keep 'relapsing' back to music, but each time they make an attempt, they get more stronger and better each time, and it tends to completely stop when people get married, coz then both husband and wife can work together to avoid music. It's always easier when someone else is suffering with you.<br>  <br>  Best of luck
n11tIuf0aa	this makes no sense<br>  <br>  but being a Roman Catholic I do believe in evolution|`|WRyHOEjSaa	Whether you call them "dogs" or not is semantics. You could call foxes and wolves "dogs" too if you wanted. But foxes and wolves are different species because they can't exchange significant amounts of genes. Chihuahuas and great danes would be different species too if it weren't for the numerous intermediate breeds that breed with one or the other and thus pass genes between them. Take away those intermediates and chihuahuas and great Danes would be separate species - much like foxes and wolves. Foxes and wolves once had intermediates connecting them too. The only difference is that their intermediates all died out.|`|759ae5ae6e1570ab62326b25526ef339aa	Intelligent humans can breed dogs into many different sizes and shapes.

Different breeds of dogs were created from random genetic mutations (Like different coat color). Genetic mutations that people felt made the dog look more desirable were bred to create more of the mutation and then it spread. There were so many dogs that genetic mutations were able to spread easily and create different breeds. This happened over thousands of years, that's why there are so many dogs that are completely different. This is NOT evolution because it was purposely done by humans and happened relatively quickly. (Evolution usually takes millions of years)|`|lfN4WuWzaa	You clearly don't know how evolution works. The different breeds of dog are man made creations because of selective breeding. Evolution occurs over millions of years through slight changes to an animal's appearance and then if a group of animals are separated by geography and they are allowed to develop and evolve independently they will eventually no longer be able to interbreed. And that is how new species develop. All house hold dogs and some wolfs can interbreed. However a dog cannot breed with a fox (same family different species)|`|KbyPVlq3aa	I don't know that evolution and creationism are at odds.

h6NUE6VTaa	??? ???????? ?????????? ??? ?????????????? ??? ???????? ???????? ?????????? ?????????? ???????????? ????????????? ?????????????? ???????????????? ???????? ?????????33:28? <br>  (33:28) O Prophet, *41 say to your wives, "If you seek the world and its adornments, come, I shall give you of these and send you off in a good way. <br>  *41 The verses from here to 35 were sent down in the period contiguous to the Battle of the Trench and the raid on Bani Quraizah, whose background we have touched upon in the Introduction to this Surah. According to a tradition related in Muslim on the authority of Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah, "One day when Hadrat Abu Bakr and Hadrat 'Umar visited the Holy Prophet, they saw that his wives were sitting around him and he was quiet. Addressing Hadrat `Umar, he said: `They are sitting around me as you see: they are asking for money for household expenditure'." At this both the Companions rebuked their daughters and said, "Why do you embarrass the Holy Prophet and demand from him that which he does not have." This event shows how hard pressed the Holy Prophct was economically at that time and how distressed and embarrassed he was feeling at his wives' demand for domestic expenditure during the period when a bitter conflict was going on between Islam and paganism. <br>  <br>  ????? ???????? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ?????????? ??????? ??????? ??????? ??????????????? ???????<br>  ? ??????? ?????????33:29? <br>  (33:29) But if you seek Allah and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, you should rest assured that Allah has prepared a great reward for those of you who do good. " *42 <br>  *42 At the time when this verse was sent down, the Holy Prophct had four wives with him: Hadrat Saudah, Hadrat 'A'ishah, Hadrat Hafsah and Hadrat Umm Salamah. He had not yet married Hadrat Zainab. (Ibn `Arabia Ahkam ai-Qur an. Egyptian Edition, 1958, vol. III, pp. 512-13). When this verse was revealed, he first spoke to Hadrat 'A'ishah, and said: "I ask you a thing; do not be hasty in answering; consult your parents, then decide." Then he told her of Allah's Command and recited this verse. She replied: "Should I consult my parents about this?-I seek Allah and His Messenger and the Hereafter. After this he went to each of his wives and asked the same thing and each one gave the same reply as had been given by Hadrat `A'ishah. (Musnad Ahmad, Muslim, Nasa'i). <br>  This is termed takhyir, i. e. to give the wife the option to decide for herself whether she would stay in wedlock or would separate from the husband. This was obligatory for the Holy Prophet because he had been commanded by Allah to offer such an option to his wives. If a lady from among the holy wives had opted to separate she would not have separated automatically but would have been separated by the Holy Prophet, as is clear from the words: " . . . I shall give you of these and send you off gracefully." But the Holy Prophet would certainly have separt red her because as a Prophct it would not behove him not to honour the word. After divorce apparently the lady would have stood excluded from the category of the holy wives, and she would not be forbidden to any other Muslim; for she would have chosen divorce from the Holy Prophet only for the sake of the world and its adornments of which she had been given the choice, and obviously the option could not be exercised in case she was forbidden to re-marry. On the other hand, the intention of the verse also seems that the Holy Prophet was not left with any authority to divorce the wives who chose Allah and His Messenger and the Hereafter in preference to the world. For takhyir had only two sides: if a wife opted for the world, she would be divorced; if she opted for Allah and His Messenger and the Hereafter, she would not be divorced. Obviously, if a lady chose one alternative, the other would become forbidden in her case by itself. <br>  In Islamic Law takhyir. in fact, amounts to delegation of the right to obtain divorce. The husband himself gives the wife the choice to stay in wedlock with him or be separated. Here are briefly the injunctions which the jurists have derived from the Qur'an and Sunnah in this regard: <br>  (1) Once a husband has given this choice to a wife, he can neither withdraw it nor stop her from exercising it. However, it is not necessary that the woman must exercise it. She may choose to remain in wedlock with the husband, or may prefer to separate, or may opt nothing and let the right of divorce be annulled. <br>  (2) There are two conditions of this choice being transferred to the woman: (a) The husband should have given her the right of divorce in clear words, or if there was no clear mention of the divorce, he should have had the intention of giving this right; e.g. if he says, "You have the choice" or "your business is in your own hand," such indirect words will not transfer the right of divorce to the woman without the intention of the husband. If the woman claims it and the husband states on oath that he had no intention of giving the right of divorce, his statement will be admitted, unless the woman produces evidence to the effect that those words were said during a dispute, or in connection with divorce, because in that context delegation of the right would mean that the husband had the intention of giving the right of divorce. (b) The woman knows that she has been given the right of divorce. If she was absent, she should receive information of this, and if she is present, she should hear the words. Unless she hears the words, or receives the news, the right will not be transferred to her. <br>  (3) As to the time limit within which the wife has to exercise her right if the husband gives it her absolutely without specifying any limit, there is a difference of opinion among the jurists. Some jurists have expressed the opinion that the woman can exercise the right at the same sitting at which the husband gave it her; if she leaves the place without making a response, or turns her attention to something else which indicates that she does not want to make a response, she forfeits the right invested in her and her choice no longer remains. This is the opinion of Hadrat `Umar, Hadrat `Uthman, Hadrat Ibn. Mas`ud, Hadrat Jabir bin `Abdullah, `Atta, Jabir bin Zaid, Mujahid, Sha'bi, Nakha`i, Imam Malik, Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam Shafe`i, Imam Auza`i, Sufyan Thauri `and Abu Thaur. The other opinion is that her exercise of the choice is not confined to that sitting but she can exercise it even afterwards. This opinion is held by Hadrat Hasan Basri, Qatadah and Zuhri. <br>  (4) If the husband specifies a time limit and says, for instance, "You have the option for a month or a year, or your business is in your own hand for so long," the wife would enjoy the option only for that long. However, if he says, "You can exercise this option as and when you like," her option would be unlimited. <br>  (5) If the woman intends to obtain separation, she should express her intention clearly and definitely. Vague words which do not express the intention clearly will have no effect. <br>  (6) Legally, the husband can give the option to the waft in three forms: <br>  (a) He may say, "Your business is in your own hand;" or <br>  (b) he may say: "You have the option; " or <br>  (c) "You are divorced if you so please. " <br>  The legal consequences of each arc separate as explained below: <br>  (a) If the husband has said: "Your business is in your own hand," and the woman responds clearly to the effect that she would opt for separation, it would amount to an irreversible divorce according to the Hanafites. That is, after this the husband will forfeit his right to have her back as his wife. However, they can remarry if they so like after the expiry of the waiting period. And if the husband said, "Your affair is in your own hand to the extent of one divorce," this will be regarded as the first reversible divorce. That is, the husband can take her back as his wife within the waiting-period. But if the husband had the intention of all the three divorces at the time of delegating to the woman the right of divorce, or mentioned this specifically, the woman's exercise of the option in such a case would amount to divorce no matter whether she pronounces divorce thrice on herself or says only once that she has chosen separation or divorced herself. <br>  (b) If the husband gives the woman the option to separate with the words: "You have the option," and the woman opts for separation in clear words, it will amount to one reversible divorce according to the Hanafites even if the husband had the intention of giving option for three divorces. However, if the husband has clearly given option for three divorces, the three divorces will take place only on the woman's exercise of the option for divorce. According to Imam Shafe'i, if at the time of giving the option, the husband had the intention of divorce, and the woman opts for separation, it will amount to one reversible divorce. According to Imam Malik, it will amount to three divorces in case the wife had been enjoyed; in case she had not been enjoyed, the husband's claim to have intended only one divorce will be admitted. <br>  (c) In case the words "You are divorced if you so please" have been used and the woman has opted for divorce, it will be a reversible divorce and not an irreversible one.|`|Qvc0tVOnaa	These are the good manners which Allah enjoined upon the wives of the Prophet so that they would be an example for the women of the Ummah to follow. Allah said, addressing the wives of the Prophet that they should fear Allah as He commanded them, and that no other woman is like them or can be their equal in virtue and status. Then Allah says:<br>  <br>  ?????? ?????????? ????????????<br>  <br>  (then be not soft in speech,) As-Suddi and others said, this means, do not be gentle in speech when addressing men. Allah says:<br>  <br>  ??????????? ??????? ??? ???????? ???????<br>  <br>  (lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire,) means, something unclean.<br>  <br>  ????????? ??????? ????????????<br>  <br>  (but speak in an honorable manner.) Ibn Zayd said: "Decent and honorable talk that is known to be good.'' This means that she should address non-Mahram men in a manner in which there is no softness, i.e., a woman should not address a non-Mahram man in the same way that she addresses her husband.<br>  <br>  ????????? ??? ?????????????<br>  <br>  (And stay in your houses,) means, stay in your houses and do not come out except for a purpose. One of the purposes mentioned in Shari`ah is prayer in the Masjid, so long as the conditions are fulfilled, as the Messenger of Allah said:<br>  <br>  ???? ?????????? ??????? ????? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ??????? ?????????<br>  <br>  (Do not prevent the female servants of Allah from the Masjids of Allah, but have them go out without wearing fragrance.)

Part of their role is to sort things like this and it is one of the main reasons they are paid more than other workers.<br>  <br>  From personal experience, I would not recommend talking to the culprit yourself as this often backfires and they will then say the bad things about you behind your back, rather than in your presence.<br>  <br>  Your manager needs to be aware.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	If someone crosses the line at work, you tell them that they are crossing the line.

Don't get upset or defensive.  Just treat them like the idiot they are.|`|EKjnMQVhaa	Whatever you do, DOCUMENT IT.  the problem is,  if it happens a lot and you never tell your bosses about it, and eventually they find out, they'll ask why you never mentioned anything before and it's kindof also your fault for letting it go on like this.   I would tell the person you don't like their comments.  write down the date you told them that, and then if they persist, write down all the things they say for a week.  then go up to your boss and say this is continued behaviour that you've told the person you don't like.  Your boss will recognize that as harrassment and deal with the person.  If you don't want to take it to your boss, then do what someone else said and just roll your eyes and get on with your life.  I am dealing with a person like that right now.  I'm her trainer and she's lipping me off all the time, so I simply report it in my training reports.  <br>    but if you want to file a harrassment charge, you need to document that you've informed them you don't like the way they treat you, and that they continue to treat you that way anyway.  That is the definition of harrassment.  <br>    it's tough trying to decide whether to bring it to the authorities or not, but if it's a big enough deal that you dread going to work every day, you deserve to get that sorted out.  Don't let a stupid bully ruin your life.  This isn't third grade anymore.|`|QOnkXzriaa	Tell them either you tone it down or get slapped with a class action lawsuit.

I would say that you are saved through faith.<br>  Ephesians 2:8-9 says "It is by grace you have been saved, through faith and this not from yourselves, it is the gift of God not by works, so that no one can boast." We also believe that you would pray directly to God. Catholics confess their sins to priests and the priests "mediate" between men and God. This is known as penance.

No one wants their faith grouped together with fanatics,extremists, or people who use it for means of power and conquest.  The Past of the old Roman Catholic church is horrid, not wanting to be grouped together with them is understandable.<br>  <br>  Muslims don't like being grouped together with terrorists, and that is completely understandable.  There is also the pope to consider, this man claims that he has the authority to forgive sins and make new ones; the other Christians do not want to be grouped with those who are a respecter of this man; completely understandable.<br>  <br>  During the height of the church's power, there were indeed other sanctions of Christianity.  Do you know what the Roman Catholic Church did to those belonging to any Christian sanction but the Catholic one? They killed them.<br>  <br>  If you want to call a Christian who kills other Christians for not believing in their Christianity, be my guest.  In my opinion, there is something wrong with Catholicism, if you want to think lower of me because of it, it proves my point.<br>  <br>  I refuse to respect a church that believes that the pope has the authority to forgive sins and make new ones.  Just as I refuse to respect a church that believes you can be a God.  Judge me if you want to, but that is how I feel about it.|`|zZXbWAOtaa	Because Catholics are taditionalists and charge you for everything: Baptisms, Funerals, Weddings, etc.. each one set at a different price. Catholicism isnt a religion, it is a business! They worship and pray to Mary and Saints, which is idolatry! <br>  <br>  By the way, you say you are an atheist. Here's my question to you: In order for you to claim that God (the Almighty, All Powerful, All Knowing) does not exist....you yourself have to be all knowing as well.<br>  In other words, how can  anyone claim, without any doubt, that red rocks (for example) do not exist on earth without first having complete knowledge about every rock that exists in this universe? <br>  Atheism literally means "no God"|`|SVgPkExsaa	they are both christian. the term christian its not even a religious denomination. its actually a word to describe somthing. the word christian is used to describe someone who is trying to be christ like or that follows in the teachings of christ so basically every religion that includes jesus christ in their doctrine should fall into the cathegory of a christian religion.<br>  <br>  i do believe in the existense of god but the concept of belonging in a religion is utterly absurd. there is really no point.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	Well for a start we are not ''Looney'' as you put it,secondly the reason some of these so called ''True Christians'' (as they like to call themselves).

It was into the eyes of a blind man - mud was thought to have healing properties in those days - as often used today in the treatment of skin ailments. So not so weird really. Notice in the story of the lepers only one returned to thank him. His purpose was to show the love of God towards his creation.  He never claimed to be powerful his abilities showed he was.  In fact many times he told people not to mention they had been healed - healing was just evidence of God's love - Many people are healed but don't follow Christ.  Faith is not necessary to be healed though.  After all he raised Lazarus from the dead and one could hardly be oozing faith when one is dead. Healing is a debatable subject - he only healed one person at the pool also - which puzzled me.  But then who is like God or indeed who has the mind of God. I don't believe it is a matter of faith or belief as so many amazing miracles happen to people today without faith or without even asking.  Such is God - as he says My ways are not your ways - and my thoughts are not your thoughts. If we could understand God we'd all be little Gods and that could be very dangerous in the wrong hands me thinks!!|`|nqkXE1cUaa	He only did the ones that believed in him.|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Because of choice some never believed and some didn't want to be healed..|`|0EAHk0Baaa	Because each individual has his or her own story and he personalizes it.

4sUek7ugaa	Because he didn't agree with Darwin and rejected the idea that the Aryan race didn't come directly from God.<br>  <br>  Hitler had many of his informal conversations tape recorded. These<br>  have been compiled into a book titled "Hitler's Table Talk". In<br>  that book it is recorded for for the night of July 25th, 1942, into<br>  the morning of the 26th Hitler said this:<br>  <br>  'From where do we get the right to believe, that from the very<br>  beginning Man was not what he is today? Looking at Nature tells us,<br>  that in the realm of plants and animals changes and developments<br>  happen. But nowhere inside a kind shows such a development as the<br>  breadth of the jump, as Man must supposedly have made, if he has<br>  developed from an ape-like state to what he is today.'<br>  <br>  Note that Hitler says that he believes that Man had not changed or<br>  evolved over time, and certainly has not "developed from an ape-like<br>  state". Also note that he even used of the word "kind" in this<br>  statement. He was a creationist.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	Hadn't known that. Thanks!<br>  <br>  My guess would be that Hitler banned Darwinian books because the major religious leaders of the time looked down on them, and he either accepted those leaders' views or simply wanted to gain their favor. The two major religious sects in Germany at the time were Hitler's natural allies in his campaign to scapegoat Jews. As Dawkins has noted: "Anti-Semitism has been rife in Europe for many many centuries, positively encouraged by most Christian churches, including especially the two that dominate Germany. The Roman Catholic Church has notoriously persecuted Jews as "Christ-killers". While, as for the Lutherans, Martin Luther himself wrote a book called "On the Jews and their Lies" from which Hitler quoted. And Luther publicly said that "All Jews should be driven from Germany."" <a href="http://richarddawkins.net/article,2488,Open-Letter-to-a-victim-of-Ben-Steins-lying-propaganda,Richard-Dawkins" rel="nofollow">http://richarddawkins.net/article,2488,O...</a> <br>  <br>  This reason presumably also explains the following quote from your same source, banning: "All writings that ridicule, belittle or besmirch the Christian religion and its institution, faith in God, or other things that are holy to the healthy sentiments of the Volk."|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	Because he believed in Eugenics, and a lot of writings on actual evolution would have gotten in the way of that.<br>  <br>  People who believe Hitler was a Catholic will have to ask themselves why Catholics were sent to the death camps along with Jews.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	Because at the time he did that - he WAS a Roman Catholic,<br>  and back in the 1930s they had not accepted Satan's evolution lies !<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|KMrclzpLaa	He was suppose to be 'christian', that why he tortured the Jews. because they didn't accept Jesus as the Messiah.<br>  <br>  But don't be offended if you are christian.

I'll have to admit, church does seem like just a lower version of the catwalk (although to me it's the best place in the world) but I guess it's something that you have to live with. As long as you are happy the way you are, then it shouldn't matter. Just close your eyes and pray to God.|`|9UQlhzitaa	because church in these times means social scene.People have forgotten we go to church to share or strength and weakness with the other saints of Christ.<br>  <br>  Church is with in you,it is where the holy spirit dwells with in.During the first century house's were the meeting places of the church.

He may turn and have pity <br>  and leave behind a blessing— <br>  grain offerings and drink offerings <br>  for the LORD your God.  <br>  The New International Version, (Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan Publishing House) 1984.<br>  <br>  <br>  The verb in verse 13 is rend, not render. (Rend<br>  To divide; break or tear apart.) It was a common Hebrew custom to tear one's garments to show grief, sorrow or repentance, God wants us to show a Godly sorrow and tear our hearts, not our clothes.<br>  <br>  The issue of making church into a fashion show is a separate matter. James addresses this in the following manner:<br>  <br>  Jas 2:1-4  My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.  (2)  For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,  (3)  and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or, "Sit down at my feet,"  (4)  have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?<br>  <br>  <br>  Paul has this to say:<br>  <br>  1Ti 2:8-10  I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling;  (9)  likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,  (10)  but with what is proper for women who profess godliness--with good works. English Standard Version<br>  <br>  My church has a come as you are policy. All are welcome no matter how they dress, as long as it is within the bounds of decency. Our pastors often wear jeans, and even the most shabbily dressed of the homeless is welcome. In fact, that is our primary ministry. We serve a hot meal and distribute groceries every Saturday evening.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this helped you with these verses, God bless.|`|r2JPcUN8aa	Yes and why do they render their garments with all that tacky god fearing jewelry?  Two weeks ago I saw a woman speaking at a City Council meeting and she was wearing a cross pin that was large enough to hang a baby from.  She was clearly trying to make the point that she was pure.  However, I noticed her shoes were dirty.|`|8pQrIL90aa	As a young man we called it our "Sundays best", so we would wear clothes that were only designated for church because it was said that we should come before God showing him respect and being clean in his presence, if we have been blessed to be able to present ourselves as such.<br>  I veer away from those old traditions, going to church in sweatpants and a hoodie sometimes because I figure that after 4-5 years most people only see me in my best, and not really know who I am outside the church. I go to show them this is who I really am, and I am still accepted by God regardless of what I wear.<br>  <br>  I see some people at our church do come in tight dresses, hip higging stuff and I don say nothing, people can wear what they like. But to me, a chaste woman does not want to flaunt herself in that manner. I want a godly woman, not a fashionista. Its okay to look good and still show a level of personal reservation, but sometimes I got to turn my head before I sin like david did with bathsheba!

I think because black people have had more trouble, they have tried so hard to get those equal rights, that, now they almost have them - well legally anyway, that society has forgotten racism works for white people too. No one dares to say anything prejudice towards a gay black man because of how much attention the media has given towards racism too.<br>  <br>  If that makes sense at all?

You cannot however hide being black. <br>  <br>  That said, I have encountered more opposition for being gay than I have for being black, of course that could simply be because I live in such a multicultural area.|`|yOYB4UXeaa	Sorry but being black and male<br>  <br>  I know I'll get reported but...<br>  <br>  I see society seeing the average black male as dishonest and having a prison record<br>  <br>  I see society as seeing the average openly gay white male as YES all girly but has a JOB and has an income|`|XuhQS9wsaa	Society is more against gays.

I can be funny, I am a decent tennis player, etc.  Even if you are shy, you can still open up to people that you meet and establish good relationships.  You don't have to be the most outgoing in a bunch.  There has to be something that you are good at.  Think of one of your talents that makes you feel really good.

neFd6a4paa	Seriously, I saw the same exact thing when I was in school. It was about 65% black and they treated whites and asians like HELL. Constant attacks, and it wouldn't be 1 on 1 it would be 10 on 1. They would rip someone's clothes off and stomp them. They put my 4th grade teacher in the hospital (it was H.S. senior's and adults) beat up male and female teachers, attacked the principal, security guards and especiall bus drivers. <br>  <br>  Lots and lots of problems. It is a class issue though. The black political elite like Jesse Jackson, Bobby Rush, Sheila Jackson Lee, that poet laureate of New Jersey who made a poem about raping whites, people at that level who made their career on stirring stuff up---many of them are racist and even black supremacist. You'll also see a lot of the lower class blacks as very racist and violent.<br>  <br>  The middle class and the majority are just fine and want to live in peace.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately racist black people tend to be very violent and disruptive.<br>  <br>  They view white people as timid when really white people are often taught to just follow the rules and don't start fights. Be orderly. The racist black people are taught to be violent against whites, asians etc. To get them before they get you. When I got out of there and saw life in the military, there were a whole different class of black people there. Yes some were racist, but even the racist ones weren't crazy and disruptive.|`|d5K8wORqaa	mhmm! i asked the same thing. im sick of it they walk around like they are above me or something.|`|Jucak0HLaa	That's what I say too!!People think that white people are the only ones that can be racist,but black people can be too.They also think that every single white person is racist,or a large majority of them.|`|0hsh000waa	Why do people have start their point with a disclaimer "I AM NOT RACIST" LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  That sounds hypocritical but I don't know any African Americans like that..... <br>  Not all African Americans are racist the ones that are they are fools just like white racist end of story.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	Just because someone doesn't like you doesn't make them racist.

What I have noticed is that racist black people tend to be the uneducated, unmotivated, do nothing with their life type of people. They blame white people because who else do they have to blame. I have not noticed blacks being racist if they have a life, like a job & an education.It is not that black people are racist, it is just a certain class of black people.Don't allow them to represent a whole race. Some want to use the excuse that the white race kept them down, the slavery thing and all. But actually blacks sold other blacks into slavery, then some very awful racist white people bought them & really abused them.Obama didn't play the race card & didn't let the white people hold him back. Good for him, he is now president. There are some really awful racist white people. Again usually low intelligence level white people.Afraid there wife or daughter will take off with a black man. And of course all those warning's from there ancestors about how black people want to take over the country. Then take all there money for welfare so that they won't have to work. But again that is just a certain class of white people. They should not represent the whole race.|`|oHvmqpxmaa	Well, there's white people that are like that too.
AA10829445	I don't really believe that anyone knows what they would do in any circumstances until they're faced with it.  I don't think you can prepare for a tragedy beforehand and I also don't believe we can judge anyone.  It is for God, alone, to judge someone.  I'm sure that wife will have a hard life alone & always have the burden of remembering her husband.  To me, that's a lifetime of punishment and life is hard enough without adding such a great burden.  Even though the State home gets his SSI payments, his children are entitled to benefits until they're 18 yrs old ( in the USA) from Social Security.|`|GaKVvupTaa	Very unfortunate situation<br>  <br>  In short, it may not have been the right thing to out (out of love) but she won't go to hell for not taking care of her husband.<br>  <br>  You go to hell for not having faith in the Lord Jesus|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	My husband and I spent 11 years taking care of my abusive and combative father-in-law. We made the decision to put him in a nursing home after the Christmas holidays because we were exhausted and couldn't take any more. Fortunately for my husband's  mental and emotional sake, his dad died in the middle of that December, never knowing what would have happened in January.<br>  <br>  My father in law was semi-mobile and could take care of some of his own needs, unlike that poor woman's husband who apparently couldn't do much for himself from what I gather by your description. If my husband and I were exhausted and unable to continue, I can only guess the hell that she must have gone through.<br>  <br>  God understands that we're human and we can only take so much. I don't think He'd have a problem with her decision to care for herself and her children while allowing health care professionals to care for her husband.|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Severe brain damage in a person requires 24/7 care.  That is equivalent to three 8-hour shifts of people to feed, wash, toilet, and do everything for that person.  No one person can possibly do it by themselves AND look after 2 small children.<br>  <br>  This situation requires common sense: to create the best care by professionals for the injured husband.  The wife can visit her husband when she can manage it.  Perhaps he doesn't even recognise his wife.  This is a situation that has nothing to do with God or what other people think - it's none of their business - they are not walking in that wife's shoes.  It has everything to do with what's most practical and what saves the sanity and health of those involved in that family.

THEY ARE AGAINST RELIGION PERIOD. Look at the billboards and none of them say Christianity. <br>  <br>  <br>  Also about the anti Republican billboard. Both parties put up hateful posters and ads.|`|TLLklriUaa	Actually the first three signs appear to be against all religions, not just Christianity.<br>  The fourth one appears to be addressing the fact that Bush and his cronies lied about weapons of mass destruction to justify invading a country. Not sure what this has to do with Christianity.<br>  <br>  As for me, I have stated that there are much better uses for the money spent on billboards from either side.<br>  <br>  A pro-life website claims their billboards cost anywhere from $350 to $3000 per month . If they are really pro-life, I wonder why they are not using that money for cancer or AIDS research and treatment or to get food to the tens of thousands of people who starve to death everyday?|`|s1zitZMOaa	How do you get that those billboards are anti-Christian? None of them say anything about Christianity. They all use the word "religion" and "religion" does not = "Christianity". You are aware that there are many, many religions? <br>  <br>  At any rate, I'm unconcerned with billboards regardless of the position they are supporting. If someone has the money to put up an ad supporting their cause then that's their right. It's a free country.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	First of all, Bush has nothing to do with Christianity.  Jesus would abhor his policies of hatred, deception, and preemptive war.<br>  <br>  As for "anti-Christian" billboards, those weren't.  They were anti-RELIGION billboards.  Or do you think that Christianity is the only religion in the world?<br>  <br>  Anyway, Christians own this country.  Their holy book, the most violent piece of literature ever written, is slowly but surely replacing the US Constitution.  Atheists, on the other hand, are the most oppressed group in the country, above even gays and Muslims.<br>  <br>  Get a clue: when you're a 70% majority, it's not possible for you to be persecuted.  Christians in this country are doing their damnedest to make sure that people who don't agree with them have no rights.  Doing a pretty good job, too.<br>  <br>  Atheists are severely persecuted.  They're trying to get their message out so that people will stop treating them like dirt.<br>  <br>  Get over your martyrdom complex.  Christians are the bossiest, most controlling group in this country, and Atheists and people of other religions are sick to death of them whining every time we try to defend ourselves from your self-righteous, superiority complex attempts at creating a theocracy.  Defending one's rights is not an attack on Christianity.  Keep your Bible out of our Constitution, then we'll quit complaining about your religion.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	we go and put up anti Christian billboards because complaining about yours doesn't work.<br>  <br>  At least we don't  put up blatant lies, like claiming atheists hate america.|`|sgHvnxe2aa	Here's my message..... :-)<br>  <br>                 NO BLOOD - NO HEAVEN!!!! <br>  <br>       EXODUS 12:13 - LEV. 17:11 - HEBREWS 9:22<br>  <br>  If I had the means to do so, I would have this on a billboard, like at a lg<br>  airport...

But apparently, youre so conceited as to be unable to realize that other religions besides your own exists. Shame shame.|`|AA11135281	Those billboards aren't anti-Christian, they're letting people know that it isn't necessary for one to have ANY religion at all.<br>  <br>  And the vast majority of atheists aren't anti-freedom of expression.  We wouldn't deny Christians the right to have billboards.  That doesn't mean, though, that we can't complain about them, or counter with some of our own expressing an alternative viewpoint.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Freedom of speech is relevant to all belief systems.  As a member of the Freedom From Religion Foundation I found it not only morally but constitutionally abhorrent and wrong that the billboard we erected in Rancho Cucamonga, CA was taken down after one Christian called the mayor's office and said "I believe in freedom of speech, but this is taking it too far."  <br>  <br>  If you are a citizen of the United States of America, I would be interested to hear if you actually think that was right.  Those billboards aren't anti-Christian, as you say.  They are just billboards asking people to think about what it would be like if there were no religion in the world.  I don't understand what is so hard about that.  <br>  <br>  Here is the article about the woman who had the billboard taken down in CA (unlawfully):  <a href="http://www.insidesocal.com/news247/2008/11/controversial-imagine-no-relig.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidesocal.com/news247/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  My husband and I are proud members of FFRF and we don't believe in censorship in any form.  If Christians want to use their private (I repeat, PRIVATE, not public) dollars to put up billboards, they can do that.  So can we.  Our goal is not to slander, it is to create awareness about freethinking and godlessness and to make sure that church and state remain separated.  <br>  <br>  If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.|`|WbaN6osZaa	Laura - I hate to tell you, but there are more religions than Christianity, not one of those was 'anti-Christian'.<br>  <br>  Not like this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://pulltheplugonatheism.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pulltheplugonatheism.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  You have had the public billboard for 2000 years, now y'all can't simply kill non-believers for having their say, I'm sure that theists can deal with a few cheeky non-specific ripostes....in the spirit of fair play?<br>  <br>  No?<br>  <br>  Oh well...|`|1du7Nbfbaa	Just as all Christians are not alike, there are many different Atheists. More than likely it is one group of Atheist complaining about Christian billboards and a completely different group of Atheists putting up their own billboards.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Not quite.<br>  <br>  The atheists are relaying information about christian cults.<br>  <br>  The christians are calling for outright censorship (again).<br>  <br>  You fail (again)|`|wwdllMzYaa	not one of those are "anti christian"<br>  they are anti religion<br>  and one is anti polititians, probably repuublicans<br>  but none of them said anything about christianty and only christianty|`|AA11058044	How are these anti-Christian??<br>  <br>  Seems to me they're pretty much equally applicable to all religions.<br>  <br>  Why do you think they are targeted at only your religion?<br>  <br>  Self important much?|`|1295e57ae07cf479cc3522bd7b13d4e5aa	First none of those billboards are specifically anti-Christian. As an atheist the Christian billboards used to bother me but now I only don't like the ones that say I am going to hell. The reason behind this is if someone thinks that they are going to heaven and I am going to hell they tend to treat me as less of a person since 'obviously' my life is less important if I am not going to heaven. <br>  And speaking of brainwashing children there are Christian churches out there, particularly in the South where I live, that promote Creationism to the point of dismissing evolution as blind chance, which it is not, and say that the earth is only about 5 thousand years old, going against scientific data.|`|9dOfxwuIaa	Its not anti-christian, its anti deist<br>  <br>  The last one has nothing to do with religion at all. <br>  <br>  id10t error my friend, id10t.|`|4d16b72ffa495ae128ab9f89679fc203aa	Just as some atheists complain about the christian advertising, the christians are complaining about the atheist advertising.<br>  <br>  Both sides could stop advertising, and thus save some money.  But somehow, I doubt this will happen.<br>  <br>  What is good for the goose, is good for the gander.<br>  <br>  FYI, the last billboard you posted is not of any atheist nature.|`|EXurNsB4aa	I don't see how those are considered hateful, though.|`|6w1e6zUVaa	First of all, teaching your children Christianity is technically brainwashing as well.  And they do it for the same reason you do it.  Because if someone doesn't believe what you believe you can possibly understand why.  I'm on the fence and don't care to dance on either side of it.  However I can use my free thinking and understand both sides.  By posting this question all you're doing is saying, "Fellow Christians lets continue bashing the atheists." aren't you?  Which means now one of them will search the web and find a billboard that they don't like and will ask, "why do they (Christians) always try to convert us.  My question to you is, "why do you care?"|`|uin3ffWDaa	because people are narrow minded jerks. i'm an agnostic. i believe we should be tolerant about each others religious choices. no matter what side of the fence you are on.|`|XbZIicftaa	The first one I see your point, the second two I don't think would brainwash any children and the last is not religious at all.<br>  <br>  I just ignore the billboards but there are some really nasty christian billboards out there.  I personally have never seen a billboard promoting atheism, or attacking religion though.  <br>  <br>  Who cares anyway?|`|qPbKJeXzaa	I am amazed!  Why on earth would anyone want a billboard put up pro-religion or anti-religion?  I have never been to America.  Are you a country full of billboards?  Aren't they all an eyesore?|`|pUOkWQ1yaa	I don't care about Christian billboards. It's America - freedom of speech. I hope most - both Christians and Atheists - are tactful though. <br>  <br>  But back to your question - a lot of people are hypocrites. And the 2nd and 3rd are not very anti-Christian or hateful. It gives information for like minded people to find each other.|`|KMrclzpLaa	Why do christian do the same? thats what i wanna know :/|`|S4XUl7qWaa	They're just atheist billboards, honey. Don't take it so personally!<br>  <br>  I'm an atheist and I have to drive by no fewer than four church signs on my way to get my kids from school every day. These signs on any given day say a number of things about certain people burning in hell, so on and so forth. Turnabout is fair play my dear.<br>  <br>  Someone can dish it out but can't seem to take it, and that someone isn't me I promise you.<br>  <br>  edit: seven thousand thumbs up for Emily H! You said that so well.|`|b8e3dd68b7fdbbbac6132e0c73015651aa	I don't see the hate anywhere in these billboards.  You push your agenda, they push theirs.  It practically seems fair, no?<br>  <br>  And what does questioning Bush have to do with Religion?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Uh... is it true that you used some very unChristian like derogatory language to another forum member in a private message? Seems somehow hypocritical.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	LOL.  I love how you add the political billboard to the list of atheist billboards.  Because clearly, all liberals are evil, nazi-commie atheists because they don't think like you, and that means they are bad.|`|x08oohwpaa	The last one is a political message what's that have to do with atheists?  Lots of Christians didn't agree with Bush.  <br>  <br>  I don't think these are any worse than Christian bill boards.  I don't complain about them, they annoy me but freedom of speech baby.|`|iZrNlSIJaa	We live in a free country that espouses and encourages freedom of speech. They aren't trying to brainwash, they're just stating their opinions, just like Christians are when they stick their billboards up.|`|nMWtEmEFaa	Because it's the only type you see. There are only religiously motivated billboards around, which is why they made billboards with the opposite view. <br>  <br>  I'm glad there's diversity now though.|`|pYomxgYfaa	Not all Atheists are like that.

But then again you can't knock them for trying to spread their beliefs. Look at the history of Christianity|`|SrSGgPoraa	I think if a Christian wants to put up a billboard like that it's fine, the problem is that Christians turn around and complain to whoever runs the billboard company that the atheistic billboards offend them.

Freedom of speech means just that. You're free to plant a big damn building with a giant cross on it on a public street and preach about how homosexuality and abortion are ruining the world, and i am EQUALLY free to put up a sign saying god doesn't exist.|`|WUfJaIOHaa	Why not try to help someone or try to keep peace.Why do billboards at all ? They should put their time and energy into doing something good.I believe in a Higher Power.Spirits are all around us but a lot of people are not sensitive enough to feel their presence.Ask an atheist if there is a Satan and what do they say ? If they say there is then they have to believe in God.

sVQ0IB0Gaa	I wish every body could quite smoking. Then where would the gov. get their tax money? high fat food?They are the number one cause of death in this country so do you hate fat poeple too? You must be an athiest because in the bible and I quote,"God put forth all plant bearing green seed to be used for human consumption" So maybe the smoking is wrong but you can have all the pot brownies you want.I don't know what has angered you so about pot smokers, I don't happen to be one myself but they are not the ones robbing and stealing and killing.  I feel your anger would be much more productive if you aimed it at someone who really is harmful to society. How about the child molesters, the crack addicts, the lazy poeple suckin up all the welfare money that caused this recession?|`|rk0C7KMxaa	i highly disagree|`|6gthdHpnaa	I agree with most of what you are saying, but I don't think people should hate other people/think they are evil because they smoke pot.

33ppbrMJaa	Even though America is called a Super Power, which is dubious at the moment, it is certainly not the number One Country in the world, unless you are an American, and then your view is a little prejudiced.<br>  <br>  Actually, we are near the bottom in educational issues. We have the highest high school dropout rate in the world. We have fewer high school graduates going on to higher learning and about half of our college freshmen drop out before graduating.  Our scientific world has been limited by the backward view of our country's government, so the scientists of other countries are surpassing ours.<br>  <br>  In medicine, we rank very low in prenatal and postnatal care. We lose babies.  However, we do have brilliant surgeons who perform miraculous tasks from time to time, but medical care is so expensive it is prohibitive. Many people travel to other countries to receive cheaper, superior medical care. Some fifty million Americans don't have health insurance or dental insurance. American dentistry is so expensive, we are known as the "yellow tooths."  <br>  <br>  I have never met immigrants who are rude.  Most of them are friendly and eager to help in any situation, if you can surpass the language barrier.  <br>  <br>    Is this some kind of a test?  You must know that Americans think of themselves as compassionate, loving and caring, but have often sat around doing nothing while atrocities occurred throughout the world.  At the moment, Americans have a rather superior, arrogant attitude..."Why should I help him when I worked hard for my money myself?"  It comes from eight years of greed and selfishness and let's hope the change is permanent.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	There is not such a thing as forth world countries.

Being fed inside the penitentiary who has the right to complain abuse while the victim may still be contributing his tax payment to keep the criminal alive inside.<br>  Those are some of the problems where our society may be heading to.<br>  Twisting things that were found unsound and unnatural before and now should considered just okay and right.<br>  Talking back about gay marriage, have nothing against it honestly but I only would term it as civil union between same sexes because marriage by religious or spiritual connotations are only for two people who have the natural capability to raise a family by their own.<br>  There are gays I know who have raised a family better than the common bond but still not the appropriate word to use for two people whose love is the only word they hold from each other.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	I don't have a problem with gay people.

I hold nothing against someone for being born gay, just as I hold nothing against someone who is born with Downs syndrome, or double-Y syndrome, but the actions that the condition leads to are abhorrent in that they are not natural and are in violation of the way in which we are meant to interact.<br>  <br>  Gay marriage IS wrong, the purposeful corruption of a sacramental institution that is meant to unite man and woman with God. Making it a gay rights issue is ridiculous, it is intended for heterosexual union. Complaining about not having the right to marry the same sex is as sensible as a non-Catholic complaining that they aren't allowed to receive the eucharist, and as insulting.|`|e0e3e97ecc5ec23822071f8a88c516b3aa	I honestly don't think you are a sinner for loving a man, there are gay animals as well. Do we think they are sinning, it's just human nature to get the molecules mixed every now and then, and out comes homosexuality. Your not ill, don't get me wrong. But you have to admit making love to a man may seem normal to you, but it really is not to a person who has experienced the opposite sex. Maybe society just does not understand the pleasure or the feeling, so if you don't want to be judged don't'  judge others..|`|dF5clN4daa	Salt and Light...<br>  <br>  Why do so many people go after christianity with a pitchfork?<br>  <br>  People have a right to practice homosexuality...

I have a few gay and lesbians in my family and I support them 100%|`|01T03pjPaa	because they lost the business card to their local psychologist...|`|9apjRRsRaa	My friend. Your question is a good one. First off, I have gay people in my family, one has died of AIDS virus, so I am not spouting off about the gay community without living around it since I was a little kid.<br>  <br>  The gay lifestyle is sin to God. Sin just like my uncalled for anger with my wife is sin. However, the Scripture is clear that the homosexual lifestyle is a mark that someone will not enter heaven. This goes for anyone that lives a lifestyle of permiscuous sex. Don't even try to give me the life partner thing. I know all the inside gay jokes because I have been around it. When a new guy is introduced to a circle of gay friends, the joke is that everyone is everyone else's X. I have been around lesbians, as well. The relationship is longer, but it is commonplace for a circle of friends to be lovers with multiple partners within a group of friends, as well, just over a period of 10 or 20 years.<br>  <br>  Spiritually, I will not hunt down any gay people to tell them they are wrong for their lifestyle, no more than I hunt down alcoholics or drunks. We all need to repent and put our faith in Christ. Gays are free to live their life, but all of us will answer to God one day.<br>  <br>  This is the only problem with the gay lifestyle I have in the political arena: gays should not be guaranteed insurance benefits because they are married for one simple reason, they are dying earlier. Gay men and women have a shorter life expectancy that straight couples. Insurance companies know this, and should not be told by government to give benefits to people when the company is going to lose money. Private businesses should not be bullied into losing money to try to provide gay rights. <br>  <br>  I know a lesbian who committed suicide. Don't think I am happy about this, I told her I did not want her to hurt herself and I wanted her to live, and that I cared about her. I never said one thing about her lifestyle, and helped her with things on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  In summation, I don't know that I have a problem with gay people, other that them asking for "rights" that are actually unjust benefits. The problem that they have is with God. I am commanded by God to tell people the gospel, whether they are gay or straight. After that, I pray for them, but it is between them and God. Their sin hurts me, because I know they are headed for judgment. I don't hate them, I feel sorry for them. <br>  <br>  On that note, I would like to apologize to anyone who is gay for the way the modern "church" has approached you. I care about you, God cares about you so much more, but your lifestyle will only bring you spiritual death. You may say you were born this way, but Jesus said to see the kingdom of God you must be "born again." I was headed to the same judgment you are headed for just 7 short years ago. I am no better that you, my friend, but I am eternally better off, now. Don't put your faith in a system, a political party, or in a book. Put your faith in the Author of Life. He will grant you everlasting life, but your present life has to go. <br>  <br>  John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.|`|AveVyEZDaa	why concern yourself with gay people ,there not very concerning to me.i dont care about them,they can do as they choose.its them that will pay the price in the afterlife, not me.so i dont care about gay people ,so long as they dont try to get in ny pants|`|YLW7cEjkaa	It's kind of selfish not to care what other people do.

What happened to looking past color?  If he was just trying to rhyme and be funny, there are other ways to rhyme white with right and there are plenty of other words that rhyme with white too.  <br>  <br>   I'm Asian and I don't agree with Affirmative Action either.  It's insulting to think that I achieved something because someone else felt sorry for me.  If I achieve something, I want it to be because I earned it, not because someone gave it to me because they had to just because I'm Asian.  <br>  <br>  There's a double standard in this country.  Many people don't find Lowery's comment inappropriate.  They argue: oh, it's just a joke but when the New York Post made that monkey comic thing, everybody was up in arms over it despite the fact that George Bush was portrayed as a monkey time and time again and the monkey was not meant to be racist but rather to say that the stimulus plan was written by a bunch of monkeys.  The president didn't write the plan.  Congress did.|`|iwOjydnFaa	Well i dont think that the white people who were not alive back in the days of slavery and stuff should have to apologize or anything like that. They didnt do it so what do they have to apologize for? I think its important that we remember what happened, but if a black person demanded that i apologize for ancestors misakes i would refuse. What he said was out of order, there are PLEANTY of racist minorities who hate others for a number of dumb things, so he should not have just picked on white people.

Obtainable... it depends on his personality. If he seems into you, but doesn't exactly want to show it, he isn't the right one. Don't even go to marrying. If he is a load of jerkiness, don't even bother. Telling you anything? Why? Do you want to ask ME out? If he's cutting you out, I think its over.

Demons and the devil don't know anything about the future,and can't know it,only God knows the future! Demons can bring about things to happen,by manipulation of people and events within their means as God allows them to, to the extant of His will.When a person go's to a psychic they open themselves up to having a demon come into their body,or negatively influence them in many other ways.Even just reading a horoscope can bring about these very consequences.<br>  The best thing to do,is go to a mature christian and ask for prayer,because they have God's ear,according the King-James bible which is written by God,and God can't lie! They have to pray for you and can't turn you away,and because they have Gods mind according to the bible,they have God's wisdom.Ever read the story of Solomon in the bible?He had God's wisdom which God blessed him with.He was considered by many countries in the past to be the wisest  man who ever lived, and most christians today still consider him to be the wisest man who ever lived! God bless you to know Jesus.
8VbWRkkkaa	Just go for it. I used to stress about this too. I'm always really bubbly around my friends, but when a hot guy comes around, sometimes I just don't know what to do; it's like I get stupid or something. The best thing to do is just be yourself. I know it can be hard at first, but think about the way you act around your good guy friends, and then try and act that way around other guys. When you see a random guy and want to talk to him, try to think of him as one of your guy friends; remember he's just a normal guy, not a Greek god. Just take a deep breath, relax, and talk. And remember, confidence is key.|`|n4CowmDRaa	Try asking this in another section, you may get some better responses, its not a language question.|`|pOx6vwMwaa	if u hear him talkin to someone else about something u know anything about join the conversation. always works for me|`|DC4Civrvaa	Well, you could try to talk about something he is wearing.

5YAe0Vffaa	a vampire is someone who drinks blood, and some people do, so yes.|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	there are no such things as vampires|`|1xMTNTgkaa	I believe there are different types of vampires. Not what you would find in most movies- the movie Nosferatu would be the closest to that -although the ones from the newer movies are better looking. Then there is the energy vampire that seeks humans energy as other vampires would seek blood. Cannibals, blood drinkers, those that live as vampires, ect.|`|2PZnXjZ7aa	So far, I only have knowledge of the Psychic vampires, and I doubt the media ones. This type of Vampirism is something you are born with. Genetic, I believe. However, one is not aware of it until they reach an Awakening, which normally occurs around 15-16. No superpowers or anything. They are technically human, yes humans, that have an energy deficiency and have to get 'extra' energy from someone else. There's the psychic kind, which feed on a person's energy. There's also the actually blood drinkers that get the it from donors. They can be beautiful, but it depends on genetics, just like any other human. They can be strong, but they have to work at it, like any other human. They don't have a phobia of garlic or anything. Get the point?|`|NcR27tISaa	One source for vampirism was from an old english event...<br>     A family had been struck ill by a disease (not sure of common modern name) and each died one after another. when dead the sickness would cause an orange/red liquid to come up the throat, and leak out of the mount on occasion, the sickness also caused the stomach to swell. People of old Transylvania got the notion the the people were coming back from the dead and drinking the blood of humans. after the rumor spred people changed certain features. the bat can from Africa's "vampire" bat because it would lap up blood from animals it preyed on. When u add all this together along with freaked farmers and old time folklore the vampire was born. And yes this is a true event.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	they have a possiblity to exist in one form or another, but however if they did they would do a decent arsed job of making sure they are not found and the hunters would do a decent arsed job so the public don't find out|`|nAFCQLZdaa	Vampires as we know it exist to entertain us.

N5OD5TQWaa	lol..
ge2IamhUaa	Go to your local book store and ask for a copy of a Haggadah, which is the seder booklet used to help families conduct the Pesach Seder meal, complete with blessings in hebrew and English.<br>  <br>  Are you planning on observing the rules of eight days without leavening in your home?  A Jewish cookbook can help you plan for it.<br>  <br>  You don't say whether or not you've ever been to a traditional Seder, but you may know that there are pages and pages to the ritual, recounting the plagues and the exodus, partaking of the ceremonial foods upon the seder plate, then for the kids, hiding the afikomen and giving a prize to the finder.<br>  <br>  "Making Pesach," as it is called in the Jewish community, is a huge undertaking and involves sometimes weeks of preparation for a household, not just one seder meal.  You can get a good idea of the basics from Blu Greenberg's book "How to Run A Jewish Household" which you can find at larger bookstores, oline or through the library, no doubt.<br>  <br>  I commend you on your desire to commemorate Pesach with a seder, despite most Christians' views that the commanded holy days need no longer be observed and have no relevance for them.<br>  <br>  I hope your Seder becomes a tradition for your family for all the years to come!|`|l9RDuthbaa	You could try finding a Hagada with phonetic translation. I think I got one that has every page divided to 3 - Hebrew, English translation, and Hebrew in phonetic English writing.|`|TXddP0uxaa	Go to the public library, visit the CHILDREN'S library.  There, you can find a haggadah (that is a special prayer book for passover) that is simple in language and will have full transliteration.  As a (soon to be) convert, I have found it really helpful in the past in planning my seder at home.  Good luck.|`|SJPfjaS0aa	The passover seder is VERY long and filled with blessings and rituals. I highly suggest you buy a passover Hagaddah that's both hebrew, and english (most of them have English phonetics). I actually have a few of them for my guests who dont speak a word of Hebrew but want to participate in the blessings.<br>  <br>  If you don't have time to order one, check with your local Chabad and they will give you one for free.|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	You''re planning on doing Passover WITHOUT a Haggaddah?  How would you do that?  <br>  <br>  Have you ever BEEN to a Seder?  Everything will be right there in the book.  And if your wife has the tiniest bit of sympathy for your situation, she will be sure that the haggadot that you use will have everything in that will make it possible for you to say the prayers.  All of them.|`|TbI9FGQHaa	aish.com<br>  ohr.edu<br>  simpletoremember.com
jOdzofOAaa	Good for you :) <br>  If your hairy and proud lol do a head shave;<br>  If your someone whos a wee bit lazy(or if you like the idea of getting fit/showing off ha ha) do a charity cycle ride/swim/run/hike,take photos of the stages for proof-! may be best doing in company, more fun;<br>  If your a chatter who gives your parents/friends a headache lol do a sponsered silence.(in school aswell!)<br>  If your an internet wizz and have your own popular blog sell advertising space on your page to companies.<br>  If your a bit of a socialite, invite everyone round for a barbeque or meal if your good at cooking(or a kind friend is) ask them to either pay say ￡5 obviously acknowledging it is for charity, or even better get each person to bring something/unwanted gifts/clothes as a gift for you hosting the evening/food, and do a mini-auction;<br>  If your practical and have a nice neighbourhood, advertise your services as a handyman/dog walker/oddjob/light gardener in your local shop/s (don't forget to leave your contact number on the leaflet :) );<br>  If you have an annoying habit, swear, or have a beloved possession eg.a playstation or something give it up, and get people to sponsor you so much depending on ow long you can last;<br>  If you're arty you could produce unique, personalised photo/portrait work for your friends, family, or neighbours;<br>  if your crafty make something simple and cheap and sell lots! if your at a school you might want to check they don't mind you doing this :) it could be something like bracelet style bands-i can remember a huge trend when i was at high school of people buying these from charities.<br>  I wouldn't recommend this but if your someone who takes themselves a little too serious get people to pay you to do something daft, sit in a bucket full of beans, go in the stocks, wear pants over your bottoms(get people to sign them after and keep them as a momento lol) etc.<br>  <br>  The best charity events that were ever held at my high school(organised by the students of course lol) were a 1) karaoke, this involved postering round the school week in advance-gives people time to practice, put a cheap price on it like 50p and have it at a lunch/break, getting a few of the popular/liked teachers to sign up or the ones that are up for a laugh anyway, encouraging/get word round, putting up list for people to write their names and tracks (groups and ind), sourcing music, and getting the technician to set up the sound in the main hall, and perhaps refreshments/snacks-to buy :)!<br>  2) A school 'disco' your school would probably need to get quite involved these days because of all the health and safety stuff, but the main things you'll need are a really good dj, a large enough room, and lighting access/equiptment, tickets(and on the day a reliable person to collect at door and handle extra cash), and light refreshments-keep it simple, cans and crisps.<br>  3)Netball/Basketball match-Played in our main sports hall, teams pre-arranged, 50p/something to watch, got 'popular' people involved and the loud mouths, so people just came to have a giggle really and as a talking point. Went down weel, though i think it would have been better, to do a teachers versus students match/game, more rivalry lol.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  ooo edit lol:if you don't already have one you could take photos and produce a leavers book, or a less timely option and simpler-produce a year calendar-get people who are interested in the purchase to sign up and available times- the one we had used friendship style groups to split them and say sports teams if that doesn't work. You'd have to shop around for prices, but once you've took the photos is really very easy to make a large some of money. Everyone bar one or two bought them at my high school, lovely momentos :)|`|54e2d58fd94386a1cdc5bb4a78853edaaa	Hold a race night.<br>  Ask local businesses to donate prizes or services and hold a charity auction.<br>  Do a sponsored something.|`|71h39Q5faa	Selling candy seems to be one of the easiest ways to earn money for charity.  You purchase it for one price and sell it for twice that price.  If you can get it 3 for the regular price than you have tripled your profit.<br>  <br>  If you have time and space available to you tag sales are always great.  People always have alot of things they need to get rid of.  An outdoor sale where other people can buy their donated items would raise money.<br>  <br>  A raffle is another simple way to raise funds.  You get individuals or local businesses to give you something to raffle and sell the tickets.  There are alot of valuable resources in your community available to assist you.  If you aren't the only student in this situation maybe a few of you could work together.<br>  <br>  If one of you has a parent or grandparent that knits, crochets or sews they might be able to give you something to raffle.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
fqEZyz2faa	It's completely fake. I'm guessing you weren't typing the questions yourself, were you? How it works is that after the person typing enters the phrase "Peter, will you answer this question?" or whatever the phrase is (I don't remember now), they type the answer to your question after it, but it doesn't show up on the screen so you don't see it. Then they type the question in the next space, and when they hit enter whatever they typed above appears. My friend showed me how it works after she tricked me with it... She had it insulting me. xD|`|1YNFFfmWaa	They are totally fake.

fdMKpXCHaa	If you're shallow enough to break up with someone for that reason, you shouldn't have any problem at all hurting her feelings.  Good luck.|`|ybn6beqiaa	You are seriously breaking up with someone because they are bad in bed??<br>  You teach them! You dont just break if off with them..<br>  If you liked her enough, you would give it another chance.|`|zRPXczxAaa	You don't say that she's "horrible at sex," even if you really think so.  Not only is it unforgivably rude, it is, in a sense, certainly false--because there is no standard of good/bad in sex, only of enjoyable/unenjoyable.  It's almost as terrible a thing to say to someone that you really don't enjoy having sex with her; but it has the advantage of being inarguably true, and it spares her from having to defend her sexual performance against an unfair, hypothetical, non-existent value-system.  You will learn, as you go through life, that the nitty-gritty truth, though it may sting temporarily, hurts far less, and heals quicker, than any sort of lie or falsehood.|`|g6cUQFuCaa	well if your breaking up with her just because she doesnt have sex very well obviously theres something else wrong with her or theres something wrong with you<br>  u can tell her and try and improve it|`|jcK6EXpiaa	Now that is SHALLOW.

Anyhow if this is so then ALOHA wake up and smell the mojo woman. How is she going to know she suck if you keep on faking it? When you do that she thinks she is giving you pleasure which means she thinks she screws well.<br>  <br>  Instead of running away from you relationship when things don't suit you try working on them.

qRFTEBlGaa	Surely, then, it is clear that Jesus’ words mean that the bread represented his body and the wine stood for his blood. This is confirmed by what Jesus said about the cup: “This cup is the new covenant in my blood which will be poured out for you.” (Luke 22:20, JB) Manifestly the cup of wine used on that occasion was not the new covenant. The cup merely had a symbolic connection with the new covenant. <br>  <br>  Was the loaf of bread a fitting emblem or symbol of Jesus’ literal fleshly body? Yes, for it was unleavened Passover bread. It was free of leaven or yeast, which at times pictures sin and hypocrisy.

yHfsHp6naa	Catholics are christians. Only ignorant fundies say they're not.|`|FGcwxZz0aa	The Protestant Christians really usurp the name because in actuality they are in protest of Christ's teaching and His Church. If you mean who is closer to the teaching of Christ one would have to say that it would be the Catholic Christians as well as they have the fullness of truth while the Protestants do not desire the apostolic teaching passed down to the Church. They desire and use as authority the New Testament books written by the Catholic Church and most of the Canon chosen by the Church having removed seven books from the Old Testament to suit some of their heretical doctrines. Catholics follow only Christ's teaching in its entirety through Sacred Tradition. So, It seems obvious that the Catholic Church with all of Christ's promises and veracity is really the only authentic Church as far as the visible Church is concerned. Where the invisible Church is is more of a mystery but all who are Christian are Catholic whether they recognise their familial relationship with the Church or not. Outside the Church there is no salvation. God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|0fnzDpKXaa	Catholics are Christians.<br>  <br>  Think of Christianity as a basket.

Besides, they are not satisfied with what Lord Jesus Christ has done at the cross of Calvary. They believe their leaders is vicar (substitute of Christ Jesus here on earth). They believe, partaking of bread and wine will miraculously transform to body and blood of Christ Jesus and thereby Christ is with them (too much worldly wisdom);  Pro 14:12  There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death. <br>  Pro 14:13  Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness. <br>  They believe they are the one who prepared and made the Holy Words of God yet they do not read and practice what's in it. 1Co 3:18  Let no man deceive himself.

May I ask how old are you? <br>  <br>  Theoretically, it would make you gay. Granted you and your clone are genetically the same person, but the circumstances and experiences in life will make you still different persons. Everyone of us go through certain unique set of experiences in one's live, that make us totally unique.<br>  <br>  -To give an example. Say you and your clone, grew up geographically apart you grew up in USA and he in France. The choices, the circumstances and the decisions that you would take, will make you a separate individual person (based on past experiences). It is highly unlikely that both you and him will face similar circumstances in their lives. Hence if you still feel a physical attraction to Your clone, it will make you a gay person.<br>  <br>  -Alternatively, if you and your clone grew up in very close proximity of each other, say like twins, then it is very unlikely that you will feel a physical attraction to him, as theorised by Sigmund Freud. When children grow up, close to each other, their relationships will be that of siblings, although unrelated by blood, they will not each other as potential mates. Still if you theoretically do what you stated, that will be termed as incest. <br>  <br>  Hence we can conclud that it will not be a masturbation in any case.|`|60ApQsGOaa	technically it would mean you were gay...just because it's not you.

She has more children than she can support.  Children cost money; they need to be housed, clothed, educated, fed, insured and supervised.  You obviously can't tell her not to have kids, but she doesn't have the money to support them!  And plus, it's unfair to society for her to be paid welfare.  If you can't pay for your own kid, you shouldn't have it in the first place.  People who willingly give birth to a child that either do not have a job or are simply very poor should not rely on taxpayers to support them and their children.  Poor people cannot possibly provide a good life for their children if they are struggling to pay bills, keep a roof over their heads and clothe the children.  It is not fair for middle and upper classes to have to support poor people that cannot live without welfare.  It should be illegal to raise children in low income households.  The fact that children are expensive should be reason enough to not have as many children.  It is overwhelming what she has to do to provide for her children.  Being born into a poor household simply adds to society’s burden.  The children that she has produced will end up learning the same irresponsible ways of their social welfare PARENT.  She has no job and no husband.  Those children will be/are deprived from many of life’s joys, including travelling and other luxuries.  Some may say that money does not buy happiness, but it does buy comfortable living.  Children will eventually participate in extracurricular activities, social events, school field trips, etc.  They will also need college funds.  Employed citizens who earn enough money and are self reliant tax payers should not be mandated to support other peoples’ children through taxation.  The analogy that can be used is as follows.  Two brothers drive new sports cars.  One irresponsible brother crashes his.  The parents proceed to take the other brother’s sports car away and give it to the one that just ruined his.  They tell the responsible brother that didn’t crash his to go earn another one because he makes enough money and is able to earn enough to replace his car.  The parents claim that he needs to help the irresponsible brother.  This is exactly what happens within the government’s welfare and taxation systems.  Taking hard earned money from responsible workers and giving it for free to the poor.  This system rewards non-working parents by supporting their families for free.  Welfare and government support should be for catastrophic, unforeseen events, not planned multiple pregnancies and the like by unwed, unfit and incapable mothers.  Those who earn money should not be punished by supporting other families, such as this 14 children family.  Having children does not mean that people have to live extravagantly, but children have basic physical, emotional, social, intellectual and creative needs.  This mother is less able to satisfy the children's needs and is depriving her children of a good life.|`|GdUnVFaxaa	They say that she doesn't really care about her kids and doesn't have the right setting for them.

jnnIwdtyaa	Merry Meet,<br>  <br>  If you are interested about learning Wicca and/or Witchcraft here are a few legitimate sources to glean knowledge from. One being Witchvox at <a href="http://www.witchvox.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com/.</a> Here you will gain knowledge through fellowship with other of like mind and knowledge through the countless articles posted. If this is not enough one could look into getting online training through the Sacred Mists at <a href="http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour..." rel="nofollow">http://www.workingwitches.com/wicca/cour...</a> or OZ Wicca at <a href="http://www.ozwicca.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozwicca.com/</a> , both are pretty decent for learning the Craft on the Web.<br>  <br>  Also if you are close enough to a group that specializes in education and development like the SCWF try and join them even if it’s on a limited capacity. Ultimately, study, study and then study some more. Find all you can and definitely cross reference whenever possible, this way you can get the best out of all you learn.<br>  <br>  I also suggest that you get your hands on Wicca for Beginners by Thea Sabin and/or The Circle Within by Dianne Sylvan. Both of these books are very good reading and both will give you some deeper insight to the Craft and how it relates to you. Also you cannot go wrong with anything by Scott Cunningham.<br>  <br>  Since you are a teen, I suggest Teen Witch by Silver Ravenwolf and Elements of Witchcraft: Natural Magick for Teens by Ellen Dugan.

There are some Wiccans who don't even bother with magic nowadays. I think in the beginning though, it's best to focus on the spirituality and prepare for the magic. Unlike you, a lot of people are mainly drawn to Wicca because they want to cast spells.

You should avoid reading books written by people who use phony Indian sounding names. There is one man who was ordained by wicca's founder Gardener. His name is Raymond Buckland. He lives in Ohio.

My definition of a Wiccan is someone who is initiated into Wicca.  If you aren't initiated into Wicca, but hold to the beliefs and practices, these days I think a lot of people are calling that Neo Wiccan, to differentiate that from an initiated Wiccan.<br>  There are many magickal paths and traditions, many which are attributed to Wicca, but are actually Pagan or Neo Pagan, it's kind of hard to sort them out sometimes.  Pagans and Neo Pagans may incorporate some Wiccan beliefs in their path, but may also add beliefs and practices  from other traditions as well.  There are many magickal traditions and beliefs, Wicca is one of many Pagan traditions, but Pagans are not necessarily Wiccan.  There are many Pagans who are not Wiccan at all. Wiccans are Wiccan.  There are many websites of various paths of practitioners out there, take em with a grain of salt.<br>  <a href="http://www.witchvox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.witchvox.com</a> might be a good place for you to look up info on different traditions, but if you're interested in learning about the basics of Wicca I would recommend you start with Scott Cunningham.<br>  Well, there are others who don't agree with me, I'm sure, but he's one of my favorites, anyway, and one of the reasons I like his work is he's geared to the solitary practice, where a lot of the other books are geared toward groups....  it's good that you are interested in the actual beliefs, and not just looking for spells and junk, good place to start.|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	Any thing by the author Scott Cunningham and Raymond Buckland is good too.

Other characteristics of Wicca include the ritual use of magic, a liberal code of morality and the celebration of eight seasonal-based festivals.<br>  <br>  There is dispute as to what actually constitutes Wicca. Initially, it referred to the lineage of one of Gardner's rivals, Charles Cardell,although in the 1960s it began to refer instead only to lineages stemming from Gardner and operating as initiatory Mystery Priesthoods (such as Gardnerian and Alexandrian Wicca). These are now collectively known in North America as British Traditional Wicca.A third usage, which has grown in popularity in recent years, and which was debatably the original usage,considers Wicca to include other forms of Goddess-oriented neopagan witchcraft that are similar to but independent of that lineage, including Cochrane's Craft, Dianic Wicca and the 1734 Tradition; these are sometimes collectively termed Eclectic Wicca<br>  <br>  Theology<br>  Main article: Wiccan views of divinity<br>  Although Wiccan views on theology vary, the vast majority of Wiccans venerate a Goddess and a God. These are variously understood through the frameworks of pantheism (as being dual aspects of a single godhead), duotheism (as being two polar opposites) or polytheism (being comprised of many lesser deities). In some pantheistic and duotheistic conceptions, deities from diverse cultures may be seen as aspects of the Goddess or God.[9]<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] The God and the Goddess<br>  For most Wiccans, Wicca is a duotheistic religion worshipping both a God and a Goddess, who are seen as complementary polarities (akin to the Taoist philosophy of yin and yang), and "embodiments of a life-force manifest in nature."[10] The God is sometimes symbolised as the Sun, and the Goddess as the Moon.<br>  <br>  Traditionally the God is viewed as a Horned God, associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality and hunting.[11] The Horned God is given various names according to the tradition, and these include Cernunnos, Pan, Atho and Karnayna. At other times the God is viewed as the Green Man,[12] a traditional figure in art and architecture of Europe, or as a Sun God[13] (particularly at the festival of Litha, or the summer solstice). Another depiction of the God is as the Oak King and the Holly King, one who rules over Spring and Summer, the other who rules over Autumn and Winter<br>  <br>  READ MORE ABOUT IT AT ONLINE<br>  <br>  Nikki Bado-Fralick, Coming to the Edge of the Circle: A Wiccan Initiation Ritual (Oxford University Press, 2005). <br>  Raymond Buckland, The Witch Book: The Encyclopedia of Witchcraft, Wicca, and Neo-paganism (Detroit: Visible Ink Press, 2002). <br>  Helen A.

AyEkA6Flaa	He is able to express himself more freely in messaging because you are not right there looking at him.  He is shy, and since he likes you he gets tongue-tied around you.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if he is gay, bi, or uncertain between the two.  It's interesting that he avoids the question -- I'd guess he is at least bi-curious, and wonders about it, but is not fully certain.  Either that or (like many of us) he finds it hard to fully admit that he likes guys.<br>  <br>  But whatever he is, I'd guess since he is very shy, he's hoping you will make the first move.<br>  <br>  Prediction:  if you hugged him close, or snuggled with him to watch a movie, or held his hand in the darkness of the theatre, or (gasp!) even kissed him -- he would accept it.  And my guess is that he would be glad.<br>  <br>  The thing is, with his riddling words, you can't be totally certain about his feelings.<br>  <br>  So, I'd start off with the close hug, hold him tight, and just see how he responds.  If he seems to like it, then watch a movie together and snuggle under a blanket with him.<br>  <br>  If he is comfortable snuggling with you, pick a time when you two are alone in a quiet place, and are seeming close to each other, and look him in the eyes for several seconds.  If he keeps your gaze for that time, or maybe looks slightly off but still is looking towards you -- try a kiss on the cheek.  If he smiles or seems to like that, make it a kiss on the lips.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|5UJSX3vJaa	if you want to know if some guy is gay all you have to do is have an answer to one of these ?<br>  <br>  Does he own a blender? <br>  <br>  Does he like color full drapes to brighten a room? <br>  <br>  if you answered yes to either of these ?s than yes he could be gay|`|Tkq1zvRIaa	most likely bi, or bi-curious|`|g6cUQFuCaa	hes probably bi|`|0JB4eb6raa	Do you know why I think your confused?

I dont know how much I'd trust that he knows what he's talking about. Almost any self respecting pagan that knows anything knows not to call themself a Warlock, as that doesn't mean male witch. It means an oathbreaker... <br>  anyways, the answer is yes. You could easily create a barrier or use a protection spell to keep things out of your room/house/whatever. The short version of this is you'll envision yourself (or your room) enveloped in a white protective light that nothing can penetrate. It'll take some getting used to, and some practice, but once you've got it, it should be pretty easy to do. <br>  Email me if you need more info.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Well  the word warlock comes from the word for oath breaker and no follower of any pagan path would use it to describe themselves;  if you want a barrier of protection, think of an oval of white light, impenetrable white light, that turns everything away. Think it there before you go to sleep, build it up in your mind, and leave it there as you sleep, telling yourself that it will remain throughout the night.  <br>  <br>  Have you also considered that you are just dreaming and there is no OOBE? Sorry, but you have to consider everything!?<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as "pagan" magic. THere is just magic, the word pagan is an umbrella term to describe a number of religious paths.  Magic is neutral and is practised by people of faith and no faith at all. The guy is  a charlatan is probably playing on your mind deliberately - ignore him.<br>  <br>  Talk to spirits?

BhzCW1rYaa	I have lived in the company of ghosts for more than 30 years and you get used to it, and why not feel privileged to actually share the same space as that of an entity that a huge % of people will either say doesn't exist or you have a vivid imagination or simply call you a liar...<br>  The entity will not hurt you or your family, and may not even know of your existence, just because you are in the same space, you are not in the same dimension...If you get a visual, the odds are that the entity will also see you and be just as "spooked", unless he/she has been "haunting" for a long time and is aware of the situation...<br>  <br>  Here is an answer I gave recently on what are some signs you might have a ghost... Via cut & paste...<br>  I have had some good experiences with ghosts and some extremely bad experiences, of which were detrimental to my health...<br>  Some of the signs are strange smells, like cigarette smoke, perfume, flowers, and some really bad smells, like something is dead and decaying...Also changes in temperature is a good indication, this usually occurs in one room at a time, like the smells...Things also go missing, like car keys, I have had them go missing plenty of times when I was younger and living in another place...I could search the whole house and no keys, I would have to get my then girl friend out of bed and get her to drive me in her car, and when I would come home from work, which was about 1 1/2 hours before my girl friend came home, my keys would be sitting on the kitchen table or the side dresser, and you know they weren't there in the morning or you would have seen them and avoided the drama...They weren't there when my girl friend went to work either, and that was their usual place...<br>  Banging of doors, usually during the night, and the squeaky floor boards letting you know someone/thing is walking on them...Closed doors are open in the morning as are some drawers or cupboard doors in the kitchen...Apart from things going missing and turning up later, days later sometimes, things get rearranged...Books appear on the table in the morning, they have moved from the bookcase to the table and you know they weren't there when you went to bed, some of the books you haven't even cared to look at since you read them years beforehand...<br>  That should give you some sort of an idea of the tell-tale signs of an entity being close by...One more thing, they can pester you for weeks even months at a time, then nothing at all for months, then they are back to it again...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|QVWwls11aa	Yes, the ghost wants you to move out of your house or "his" or "her" house.

In Europe royals are powerless heads of state. In the middle east they are still rulers.<br>  In some countries by getting married to a Queen or Crown princess will give you the title of king, (with the princess only when she becomes Queen). But that would only be a title. The throne is hers.<br>  In the case of Spain the FORMER royal family was invited back.. the King is exactly who would have been king if the Royals had never been de-throned.|`|Hj5NFqIQaa	depends on what culture or part of the world you are talking about. sometimes you must be part of a royal family, other times it is up to whoever gains control, and sometimes it is just a battle of the strongest leaders.|`|Iqp3ZUAlaa	A king is a successor to the throne by hereditary,so any one cannot become a monarch.For an idea about what a monarch does,visit <a href="http://www.royal.gov.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.royal.gov.uk</a> and click on The Queen and the UK.|`|MvuS0zMYaa	taga notre ka ba ? dba ean eung project ntiin this 4th Quarter sa CLVE I ?

AyEkA6Flaa	Please God by being *honest*.<br>  <br>  If guys give you passion and energy; if your eyes brighten up and your heart pounds when you see a cute guy; if you fantasize about a male when masturbating; if you fall in love with guys or crush on them; if you would really prefer kissing or holding a guy more than a girl, then you are likely gay.<br>  <br>  But if girls give you passion, energy, brighten your eyes, give you orgasm, and you fall in love with girls and crave to hold and kiss a girl, then you may be straight.<br>  <br>  Just be *honest* with what you really want.  Who do your arms yearn to hold?  Who do your lips want to kiss?  Who do you want?<br>  <br>  If you really like males, then find a nice, trustworthy, cute guy, build a life with him, and even adopt a child.  Or find a gay male who is divorced and has children.<br>  <br>  You can live a happy life and please God as a gay male.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	There are no commandments against homosexuality in the bible.<br>  <br>  Early Mediterranean sexual practices always involved a dominant, seen as superior, and a submissive, seen as inferior. This was because their society was soooo patriarchal. Invading armies would often rape the men of the armies that they had conquered to show their superiority. In Exodus, when it says "Do not lay with a man as you would a woman," all it's trying to say is that if you have sex with a man, it should be because you love him, not to show your superiority to him, as you would show a woman.<br>  <br>  Being in a relationship with a man is not displeasing to God. You can be in a Gay relationship and have a loving family. <br>  <br>  You can be very well male but still be attracted to men. If you feel male on the INSIDE, then you are a man. If you feel female on the inside, you are a woman.

I also read that it is natural for people who identify as heterosexual to become aroused by sexually explicit images of those of their same gender. As for your addiction to porn, thats the main concern here. Thats what you should be mostly concerned about. Now, I am not one who believes a persons sexual preference is sinful, God creates us in ways we have no control over, but we do make a choice when we choose to watch others not committed to us in marriage fornicate with one another. You arent married to any of those people, and they arent married to their partners. The filming of this sacred piece of a committed relationship is disgustingly wrong. Not that the "freaky" crap they do is necessarily wrong, I believe that partners are deserving of equal satisfaction (Allah said so in the Quran, so long as the act does not harm the other partner in any way) but its the fact that they show it to all the world, without any thought to the children and marriages their actions will impact.|`|AA12006309	Let me explain a few important things here:<br>  <br>  Your sexual orientation is different from your gender identity.  Your gender identity is "I am a boy" or "I am a girl".  Maybe even "I am androgyne (or genderqueer, or transgender, etc.)".  Your orientation would be gay, bisexual, pansexual, etc.<br>  <br>  God has nothing to do with your choice of partner, except in as far as this is the way he created you, as he creates all things.<br>  <br>  If you are attracted to both men and women, you could be bisexual, or possibly gay in denial.  You could also be straight with an active fantasy life.  The only one who can answer this question is you.  None of us have the answer for you.

We are not spirits that merely inhabit a body of flesh. Our thinking faculties cannot survive the destruction of our body.

God’s Word gives a clear answer: “The living are conscious that they will die; but as for the dead, they are conscious of nothing at all.” (Ecclesiastes 9:5) Rather than being like a friend welcoming us to a better life, death is called “the last enemy,” according to the Bible, for it halts all of our activity.

Hope this helped.|`|Dh9QRycaaa	Ser y estar are difficult verbs to understand in english, but you just need to remmember:<br>  <br>  1. Use "ser" for:<br>  *Adjectives and descriptions: I'm tall -> Yo soy alto<br>  *Time expressions: It's 3 o'clock -> Son las 3:00<br>  * To mention a club you belong to: Gerard Way is from MCR -> Gerard Wa es de MCR<br>  *To express that something is yours: It's my book -> Este es mi libro<br>  <br>  2. Use "estar" for:<br>  *Places where you areor where you will be: I′m on the United States -> Estoy en los Estados Unidos.<br>  I'll be with you-> Estare contigo<br>  *Comunicate feelings: I'm sad and tired -> Esto cansado y triste.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ___________________________________<br>  <br>  Now, it's important for you to remember the correct conjugations, so here they are:<br>  <br>  Yo soy<br>  Tú eres<br>  Usted es<br>  El es<br>  Ella es<br>  Este es<br>  Ustedes son<br>  Nosotros somos<br>  Ellos son<br>  <br>  Yo estoy<br>  Tú estás<br>  Usted está<br>  El está<br>  Ella está<br>  Este está<br>  Ustedes están<br>  Nosotros estamos<br>  Ellos están|`|zjxr6fRsaa	ser = to be<br>  estar = to be<br>  e.g.<br>         hola yo soy susie,como estas?<br>        hi, i am susie,how are you?<br>  <br>  <br>  he is from mexico = el es de mexico<br>  he is a writer = el es escritor<br>  <br>  they are here to watch a movie = ellos estan aqui para ver una pelicula.<br>  <br>  yo soy de el salvador = i am from el salvador.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|DC4Civrvaa	Basically estar is used for feelings, temporary situations and to describe where something is.  Ser is used for a desription of personality or before a verb to state that someone is doing something.  Good luck!|`|XCn2dK1laa	When to use estar-characteristics of a person,location,<br>  when to use ser-to describe where someone's from,someone's name,time|`|8VbWRkkkaa	You ser when talking about something that doesn't change, like someones personality. <br>  You use estar when talking about things that do change, like emotion.<br>  <br>  For example, if I wanted to talk about someone who has a generally happy personality, then I would say: La chica es alegre. (The girl is happy.)<br>  If I wanted to say that someone was in a happy mood, then I would say: La chica esta alegre.<br>  <br>  Here's a website that might help: <a href="http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/serest1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.studyspanish.com/lessons/sere...</a>|`|TzZnsjquaa	In general, "ser" is more permanent while "estar" is more temporary.<br>  Ex: Yo SOY un americano.<br>  Yo ESTOY viviendo en America.<br>  However, there are exceptions; locations of things that will never actually move come to mind ("El hotel ESTA al lado de mi casa,") as do times when someone is something, even if they won't always be ("Tu eres una estudiante.")|`|h4QZfadDaa	Everyone's made it sound complicated.<br>  ESTAR is used for something TEMPORARY.<br>  E.g. ESTOY en la tienda - I'm in the shop. You use ESTAR because you're not gonna be there forever.<br>  SER is something permanent.<br>  E.g. La puerta ES rojo - the door is red. Although it is possible that the door could get painted and not be red anymore, the colour is still a pretty permanent feature of the door.<br>  <br>  THAT'S IT. There really is nothing more to it. It's easy. Get your teacher to give you some excercises on it!! (:|`|rjfft8WZaa	Ser is more for things that aren't changing, such as a physical description.  "El es flaco."<br>  <br>  Estar is for things that can change, such as emotions and locations.  "El esta en la biblioteca."
85S7YRQdaa	Say that you are gay, then say just kidding I'm bi they will care much less.|`|g6cUQFuCaa	thats tough<br>  and i think its ur choice<br>  to tell them or not<br>  and if u r u choose when the time is right|`|GjfWcWj6aa	Only tell them if you really feel the need to.<br>  Personally i like to keep my sexuality to myself.. i don't really see why anyone should know.. especially family.<br>  If you decide to tell them they WILL probably act different around you at first as it's quite hard for other people to understand and don't know how to act.|`|xj8QZyykaa	One thing to consider first is your age. I have known since I was very young (14) that I was a lesbian, but most teens go through a time of being confused about their sexuality and most "bi" (not to say that bisexuality doesn't exist, it's just that statistically teenagers who identify as bi will eventually go one way or the other) teens are not actually bi. You're not like kissing girls to get attention, you actually have a genuine same sex attraction, right? If so, I think you should think about your sexuality not in terms of complying with society, but what you're actually interested in, many gay/lesbian teens first identify as bi because society grooms them to assume that they must be attracted to the opposite sex, so anyway, in conclusion, I think you should explore your sexuality for a little while and be sure one way or the other because it can be hard to come out as bi then a year later have to tell your parents that 'sorry, I'm actually a lesbian', get what I mean?|`|EfIXhZdqaa	If your friends wouldn't accept you for who you are, do you think they were really your friends in the first place? <br>  <br>  If your family wouldn't accept you for who you are, would you want to be part of that family?<br>  <br>  Just some stuff to think on. Don't rush yourself into coming out. There's no hurry. When you're ready, you're ready.
cfiXSkE0aa	im 1/4 native american.... so yes there are|`|XLXncQu9aa	Yes.  Native Americans live on reservations that have been preserved for certain Native American tribes.  Most of them are in the Mid West and near the mountainous regions.|`|99hfFssXaa	yeah of course there are|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Of course.  There are native americans all over the United States.  Every tribe is still represented and thriving.  Some more than others but still representing their tribes.  In Canada and the U.S. you can visit reservations anywhere.  I recently met a tribal chief in northern Michigan who was also mayor of the small local town I was visiting.  These people haven't gone away.  They are a viable part of our country and most continue their tribal traditions. Every State in the United States has native american tribes and all are functioning lifestyles but not all native americans live on reservations. They are every bit a part of our culture and lifestyle.|`|B7NPXRoqaa	Yeah. In Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico there are a lot. I went on a school trip out there and we met a bunch of nice native american tribes.|`|houWY7qvaa	Yes they have them hidden away on Reservations, right here in the USA.  and I am part Native American.|`|lAZWTLtRaa	Yeah...they have kids just like the rest of us.|`|8Nqq7tkwaa	we are about 2 million enrolled native people in the usa alone. 70% of us do not live on reservations. i am one of those who does not live there at this time. many live in urban areas like NYC and chicago and st louis as well as other cities. most americans don't know any native people since we are less than 1% of the population. as a result there are a ton of misconceptions about us, some benign, others harmful.|`|aSuLnvoSaa	lol wow. they just live life like everyone else, but they dont live in tipis or anything. but they still have powows and dress traditionally for powows and ceremonies and what not|`|ldAJ3Et8aa	Yeah, they mostly all blended with the rest of the population but there are colonies or reserves or whatever of just native americans, i believe.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Yes and there are still Indian reservations too. All over as a mater of fact.,but mostly out west.|`|4593057a35a6cd4bd6202267b788e26eaa	Yes I have a few friends who are Native Americans.|`|yenUJGsoaa	dont think in america maybe a few|`|gX40pgLyaa	duhhhhhhh|`|Ie9s1Z8kaa	um yeah... im one of them no we don't live in tee-pees, most of us live on reservations like myself, there are more native americans than you can imagine, i myself am from manchester point arena band of POMO indians in northern california- our reservation houses over 300 native american families where the rent is based on income, some pay as little as 7 dollars a month for pretty nice houses, in jackson the natives there get as much as 50,000 dollars every three months from there casinos, we only get 324 dollars every three months from our tribe,...any more questions feel free to email me...|`|0RBiVF20aa	Yes, mostly living on reservations, but also living all over the country. Many tribes still celebrate old rituals and their religions, and some even still maintain the original languages, but most of them live in modern houses just like you and I. <br>  <br>  However, I think perhaps what you're really trying to ask is , "Are there still native american tribes who have had no contact with modern society, or do not know that it exists?" The answer to that is no, not in North America or the United States. However a tribe was discovered last year in South America in Brazil, that has never had contact with the outside world. They were photographed from a plane.|`|stUY1k7Uaa	Yes! There are large groups of them still living in reservations on their native land that the govt gave them a long time ago. There are also others living outside the reservations, and a lot who are mixed.|`|OWxEqZCiaa	why you selling fire water and blankets tainted with small pox again|`|28297ea80c87a2a6674d9fc31df1898baa	Yes I believe so.

BDzaxnMCaa	russian women do have round faces (but with defined cheekbones) & strong noses. not very big, but somehow still very striking eyes with eyelids that tend to droop down a little at the corners (lol thats the best way i could describe it.) russians do not necessarily have light hair and eyes... it's actually a mix, but a lot are convinced that blonde hair makes them look younger, so there are so many bottle blondes there. skin is usually golden toned (as opposed to pinkish) and pale, so it still looks "white." oh, and the bottom lip is usually bigger than the top.|`|Wq3WUoNxaa	Russian women tend to have more round faces.

hHjPFxEdaa	I'm not sure why. I think a lot of it has to do with misconceptions they got from the media in their old countries which they believed and passed on. Another has to do with the bias in Asian culture towards even dark skinned Asians. In some Asian cultures the lighter your skin the better. <br>  <br>  Most of my relatives are not prejudiced and I was raised to respect all people and cultures.|`|8fyEZtyNaa	i do notice asians seem to be very snooty around here, towards blacks and mixed people. although i did somewhat get along with this chinese boy(he was actually FROM china) once.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	If you think about it, Asian-Americans are really the newest immigration group to America from another continent. They're a significantly smaller ethnic minority and you don't find large groups outside of the West coast. Many Asian-Americans have parents or grandparents that weren't from America so they are still somewhat connected to Asian culture(s). In Asia, the only black media that makes news are rappers and most countries view rappers as criminals as a majority do break the law in awful ways. So it's ingrained before they even step foot in America. With all the black people who dress and act thug, it's easy to associate them with criminals.|`|8RmazUuBaa	Well yippie Obama appoints 3 Asians..You can all pat yourselves on the back for your accomplishment..smh..|`|92iuiuZKaa	Because they are ignorant and alot of them will do anything to feel closer to the white race!|`|t8AQF5xXaa	they r dum!<br>  they really dont know what they r doing<br>  sometimes!<br>  <br>  cant they just get that we are all just <br>  <br>  <br>  PEOPLE? LoL <br>  its just true isnt it?|`|beO40ap7aa	Its the other way around, I grew up in a mostly Black area of Baltimore City and its the Blacks who are racist against Asians. I didnt know that the C word was a racist word until I moved to the County because the Blacks around me used it all the time. Asians owned most of the stores in Black Neighborhoods in Baltimore and Blacks would call them C, G, and S words, vandalize there stores, and frequently commit acts of robbery. I once talked with some Blacks about the Dont Be A Menace to South Central Movie by the Wayans brothers and they were offended by the device in the Asian owned Liquor store that went "N----z" and I told them "If you guys didnt rob their stores at gunpoint and call them C----s all the time, they might not feel that way" The Blacks I talked to were upset by what I said but at the same time unable to respond as they knew what I said was true.|`|SUMV525Aaa	Yeah I have noticed some asians are biased against blacks, but then I've seen some black people prejudice against asians as well.<br>   I guess there are racists in all ethnicities.|`|C9QQPROkaa	I really don't understand it at all actually what have black people done to asians? I really don't understand where all that hatred comes from its ridiculous.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	Because they believe everything they see on t.v. and think B.E.T represents every black person in america.  Just a thought!|`|CvSKPHiqaa	i don't get it. it must be a case of jumping on the racist bandwagon.|`|BLvLwN4Daa	the 1st answer is right.|`|pfke6Jieaa	hey u know i met a lot of asian americans in my city and they despise middle easterns even more. i even read a lot of comments from asians on some questions on YA in the past weeks and they think we are dirty or something like that. i didnt know asians even cared about middle easterns.....lol. <br>  <br>  i think they just hate dark skin and black people fall in that category so they hate them. i got a japanese friend and he said in his country dark skinned people are considered ugly and if you are not white they wont like you.

Qe9EULsdaa	I have an Indian friend (a girl) and she's really really pretty. People think that she's part puerto rican sometimes I think so they automatically accept her. It shouldn't be that way but it is. And all the black and puerto rican guys at my school are beating down her door. Either theyre too stupid to realize that she's Indian or they just only care about skin color. The funny thing is.. she's pretty much only attracted to indian guys. The way that i'm pretty much only attracted to white guys. Sh*ts f*cked.|`|sIqXCXoVaa	In the poor part of town I see tons of dark indians and I see them date whites but don't care|`|jzG8QcWQaa	I have never heard anything like that in my life|`|0YjftXPTaa	i dont get wat your talking about|`|m9MMxjyjaa	yeah... blacks are racist.|`|2PglNTjAaa	Well, they do if they date Oriental guys.  You will never see any Indian women or black women dating a Chinese guy.|`|ziPhihHNaa	IF YOUR PRETTY AND NICE IT SHOULD'NT MATTER ABOUT SKIN TONE|`|4Vmlf902aa	Idk, but they shouldn't from black guys. Since i'm sure a smart one can tell the difference between an Indian, and a fellow black girl.
uAZlvHgiaa	Don't feel bad. It is the same in the white community. Yeah, white women are treated like second class citizens by white men.I just play the game & use it to my advantage. When your a white woman a lot is expected of you. It's like you work for your man.If you measure up, you are rewarded greatly. If you mess up you pay big.You are expected to maintain a certain weight,keep your house a certain way. Be good at raising your children (so they turn out), work outside the home (if extra $ is needed), the list goes on & on. Basically make him look really good. If you can be everything then you get a good man with a good job & get a nice home with lot's of stuff. If you do not measure up you get a loser & a loser life to go with it. Life is hard for all women.|`|EufLQ9dKaa	I think you're speaking from your own life experiences.  T.V. does not represent the majority.  Most black men are very loyal to black women.  Most black men are married to and are dating black women.  Rap videos are entertainment for those who indulge.  The women shaking their tail feather aren't as innocent.  They can take off the pumps and go to school if they choose to.  black men are very loyal to black women.  The ones who prefer to date non black women are the minority.  The myth that all the good black men want non black women goes in one ear and out the other.  The largest interracial relationship is white man/asian woman.  I really hate to hear of black women giving up on black men.  Larry King said the black women is looked at as the strongest individual in America! Yes, black women are extremely strong and independent, but that's no excuse to knock our men down.  I love my beautiful black husband because he is a good man, father, son and friend.|`|8fyEZtyNaa	now that i think about it, outside of acting, i dont think i have really ever heard of many black women achievements aside from Rosa Parks and Harriet Tubman, and people alike.<br>  <br>  i know black guys like to get all ghetto around me. i dont like that gangsta stuff, and i can never understand what they say. no black guy as of yet has approached me in a more nicer manner....<br>  <br>  as for the rest of society...well they dont think to well of mixed or blacks, so they are unimportant to me.|`|92iuiuZKaa	I agree with "Silly Fart"!|`|ncdTxID9aa	All Black people aren't the same, so even if this is directed at Black men, you don't speak for all.  In Africa, The Middle East, parts of China, etc, women aren't given the freedom to marry who they want.  Girls as young as 14 are forced to marry old men, and birth malnourished babies.  I think what influences black men in general to act the way they do towards women which other men do the same is certain lifestyles that have been perceived as popular in society, and in history as well. Pimps existed back in the 1960s as well as today, so did gangsters, and some of the most infamous are praised today.|`|npTZTzWRaa	black women in the black community are treated no worse than black men are<br>  <br>  They are also treated no worse than white men treat white women, stop buying into the hype that is meant to keep us divided as a race<br>  <br>  "What makes you stay faithful to Black men?" <br>  <br>  what kinda question is that, it seems like a bait to bash black men, how about "what makes us stay faithful to black women" or "what makes white women stay faithful to white men"<br>  <br>  "what makes asian women stay faithful to asian men"|`|kaDuXT00aa	You've got that tunnel vision change your environment then you'll understand this; Who buys the most of rap music?  Who contributes and makes the most money in the illegal market.  Its a group of people who care nothing for the well being of there own people or the rest of the human race.  Look at the economy right now this is what happens when the wrong people are allowed to hold power.  You stay loyal cause in comparison gangster are saints to elitist slave traders and sweatshop owners.  Angels in comparison to those who have made so much money off the suffering of others.  the lesser of two evils.

A natural cycle of warming temperatures I do agree with.  Seeing as temps have gone up on several planets, I don't think we have as much influence on things as we like to think.  And I too have seen the news byte about the faulty measurement equipment missing masses of ice roughly the size of California when the last measurements were taken.  This is what initially caused all of the furor over missing ice.  I do believe in conservation, responsible stewardship of natural resources, and more ecologically friendly uses of what we are using.

jjDZJmfpaa	The prerequisite of life is a theory so how can scientists come up with the same conditions of a theory that has no facts of proof?

Even Richard Dawkins has said this, that they might have seeded our planet. Im not suprised they're thinking this, I believe the pegan gods are coming back in the near future.<br>  <br>  Fact is, we are a product of consciousness. Much like anything man-made, like software.

One question though....how do scientists know what the conditions for life were billions of years ago. They weren't there. So they are basically theorizing what the conditions were. They are in a sense basing their experiment on faith. They say that at the time there was very little hydrogen in the air. They say that they get organic molecules.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27.

It has been discovered that indeed there was a flood.  See website 'black sea flood' which will show you many sites and theories on this. (And an explanation why so many civilisations have either records or memories past down the generations of this).  The book of Revelations tells of a one world government which is not impossible to imagine nowadays. We have a mini one now with the EU.  Historical facts and geographical facts prove that certain things happened that were explained in biblical terms. I.e. the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, actually happened - it was a meteorite parts exploding above the earth showering the place and many others with hitting the earth with such force that it caused the writer to say that Lots wife turned into a pillar of salt...effects of the meteor had similar effects of the volcanic eruption that hit Pompeii and left the rock like bodies of humans discovered in that area. Revelations also says that one day men/women will have a mark on their head or wrist in order to purchase food etc.again not so far fetched with I.D theft being so prevalent - far safer to have a microchip inserted in one’s body with all personal details available at the stroke of a scanner. (Dogs have them for identification) so the technology is there...and no doubt already available.  Remember the technology we see today has probably been around for at least ten years - so Lord knows what’s in the pipe line.<br>  If one really studies the bible in depth it actually reads like a newspaper – telling the day’s events and the future.  The bible was written in the manner of the limited understanding of the world as seen in those times...as said most of its historical facts, though written in a form often misunderstood today is being investigated and now shown scientifically and geographically as true, so why not the God bit? In the bible it says that the stars sing - well they do send out sound waves which can be interpreted by early civilisations as singing - how could they know that?  It also says that there will be signs in the heavens and on the earth and men will grow feint with fear - most of the world live in fear and the climate is changing so much that the signs are very obvious to all.  Also the 'circle of the earth is mentioned' how long did we believe the earth was flat.and so on and so on. One of the psalms gives a complete description of the crucifixion long before the Romans conquered Jerusalem and brought the awful torture of death to the East. These are just a few examples. The bible is quite a fascinating book when read in the right context.|`|hIaBgCrgaa	The bible tell a myth that Jesus died, there is no evidence to support this.<br>  There are thousands of artifacts from Iraq which are evidence of God's existence. In addition there are 35 ziggurats in Iraq which was known as Nippur built to various deities as well as to the Most High God El.<br>  <br>  One must understand that all religions originated with the Sumerians the oldest religion, the first, thereby the most accurate. When one understands the Origin then one can understand how they became confused by the people who didn't want you to know.<br>  <br>  HalleLuJah.<br>  <br>  whoever thumbs down you know where ta put it!|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Generally lies are made to be believable.<br>  If it is too strange to be believable it is probably true.|`|AA10556726	A bit blunt, but true.  We know the creation did not occur anywhere close to what the Bible asserts.  We know that the flood did not happen and that the Tower of Babel is a myth.  We know that Joseph, Moses, Joshuah, the Exodus and the conquering of the "holy land" did not happen or exist.  Yes, the Bible is a set of myths -- essentially lies.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	The bible was written by monks in a cave by the dead sea. A group of MEN, no women, no children. It was written to suit their needs only. Not as the word of our creator. If it were why then, are there zero sections in protection of children and animals? Why then are women put into a subservient role all throughout? Why are men to look like GODS themselves and war is contradictory all throughout the bible?

Scriptures is a allegory and esoteric. And the bible never states that the world was created 6000 years old, the people who read the scriptures have come up with that number, because they read the scriptures literally. They are just applying them in the wrong way. <br>  <br>  But the bible never says the earth is 6k years old.

2PZnXjZ7aa	The first two, Diana and Mars, are of Roman mythology.<br>  <br>  Diana was the goddess of the hunt. She was usually associated with anything in the wild, such as animals or woodland. Later, she also became the moon goddess and was also called Luna. Her Greek equivalent was Artemis.<br>  <br>  Mars was the god of war. The Romans considered him second in importance, Jupiter being before him. There's several stories including him, such as being a lover of Venus. Of course, we named a planet after him. He came to be identified with the Greek god Ares.<br>  <br>  The latter two, Hestia and Hermes, are of Greek mythology.<br>  <br>  Hestia was the goddess of the hearth, the right ordering of domesticity and the family. Her Roman equivalent was Vesta. <br>  <br>  Hermes was the messenger of the gods. There's tons of stuff about him to find. He protects and takes care of all the travelers, miscreants, harlots, old crones and thieves that pray to him or cross his path. Hermes can be recognized by his winged sandels. Oh, and is Roman equivalent is Mercury.<br>  <br>  I know more boring details, but there's the basics. Good luck!|`|eYwzlsk4aa	Well, Diana, also called Artemis in Greek Mythology is the oldest, and fraternal twin sister of Apollo. She was Goddess of the Moon, Animals, Guardian of all young women, and virgins all over Greece. She is the daughter of the God, Zeus (also called Jupiter in Roman Mythology), and the mortal, Leto. When she was young, she asked her father for a few wishes:<br>  <br>  1.) To stay young forever.<br>  2.) To never be forced into marriage<br>  3.) A carriage of her own to watch over virgin girls, animals, and guide the moon across the sky at night. <br>  <br>  Zeus granted them all. And she's happy. <br>  <br>  <br>  Mars, also called Ares in Greek Myths, was the God of War. He is the younger brother of Hephaestus, (also called Vulcan in Roman Myths) He is the second son of Zeus and Hera, (also called Juno in Roman Myths), and is the lover of Aphrodite, (Venus in Roman) -Aphrodite loved him, over her husband, Hephaestus, and they made love together many times- and Mars is the father of Eros, (Cupid). He was a coward and a bully. Whenever he started a war, he would always take sides, of whoever was winning. And if he ever got hurt, he would lose the battle and come home crying, asking his mom to heal him. And he has his own city, called Sparta in Greece. <br>  <br>  Hestia (Vesta in Roman) is the oldest of the 12 Olympian Gods. She is the Daughter of Cronus, (Saturn) and Rhea. She is the Goddess of the Hearth, Home, and Families. She originally was the 12th Goddess to join Olympus, but when the god, Dionysus, (Bacchus) was born, and made into a god, she gave up her throne for him, because they all had a fear of the number 13.  So she sits in the center of the Olympian throne room, on a small wooden chair, making meals, and keeping everyone else comfy. She was the most humble of the gods, and also the nicest. <br>  <br>  And Hermes (Mercury) is the Messenger of the Gods. He has golden winged sandals that help him fly at supersonic speed to deliver messages. He is the son of Zeus and Maya. He is also the most mischievous. When he was only 2 hours old, he stole an entire flock of cows from Apollo. And he promised to give them back, if Apollo would give him a lyre, (an old harp). Hermes is also the God of medicine, and healing, thieves, robbers, trickster, and practical jokers.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped!|`|3OfCN27Aaa	This might help. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.greekmythology.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greekmythology.com/</a><br>  <br>  I also know that Diana (also known as Artemis) was the Goddess associated with hunting and also associated with the moon. Her brother was Apollo. She can also be associated with fertility and child birth. <br>  <br>  I don't really remember anything about Mars, except that he was possiblity associated with the Romans.|`|udMJ4BKeaa	well all i know is that hermes is the messengar god!!!or u could go to wikepedia for answers!!!
qRFTEBlGaa	Jesus castigated the scribes and Pharisees as hypocritical. Jesus Christ rightly referred to the scribes and Pharisees as “fools and blind ones,” that is, persons lacking wisdom and being morally worthless, for they had distorted the truth by man-made traditions and followed a hypocritical course. <br>  <br>  Strangely, the most strenuous enemies of peace with God today are hypocritical followers of Jesus Christ, so-called Christians, particularly their religious clergy, Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant, who take the lead in this hostility to peace with God on a proper basis. And yet, back in the days of Christ’s apostles, it was his own people who, although claiming to be still the chosen people of Jehovah God, were most bitter enemies of peace with God.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

You can get a pc for under $500 at the moment, and not a bad one. You can buy on higher purchase, so you pay monthly, or just save up.<br>  <br>  Even if you don't have a pc, you can probably go to a mall/pc shop/web room and pay like $2 and email from there. Local libraries and community centers might also have pc's.<br>  <br>  Is the person who said it to you generally condescending?<br>  Or was it just this they said?<br>  <br>  If you feel they are always condescending, might be a good idea to have a word with them.

I wear some foundation, a little eye liner and mascara, and like chapstick lol. I think the reason you think white american women look so fake and unnatural is because the majority of them tan the hell out of their skin. We in america like to call this "fake and bake." I don't do it, I think it looks bad and ruins skin. However, if that's what girls wanna do its whatever.

I'm biracial and wear makeup from time to time.|`|UmMxmmRMaa	The feeling I get from this question is that you're trying to imply that ONLY non-white woman can be naturally attractive which makes you seem somewhat pretentious. Maybe you aren't, but that's just the feeling I got.<br>  <br>  Anyways, like someone else said, it's really more of an American thing than a white American thing. It's just the "look" of the time; if you look at pictures from other eras you'll notice certain commonalities in the hair, makeup, and clothing styles of those who were considered beautiful during that time. It seems bigger with white women because, obviously, whites are currently in the majority, and most celebrity white women have that sort of a look. I do know what you mean, it's not JUST white women but I totally see where you're coming from.<br>  <br>  A lot of people look funny without makeup, but it hasn't got much to do with race. Most celebrity white women have had some plastic surgery because, yeah let's face it, white people generally don't age as nicely as some other races, and if you have work done like that then there's a pretty good chance you're gonna look at least a little weird no matter what color your skin is.<br>  <br>  Just on a side note, if you still think it's just a white thing then look at Oprah without makeup. She looks a lot different without it, and she isn't white. But she's still a remarkable person who's accomplished a lot and done a lot of good for other people, no matter how much makeup she wears.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Have you ever seen an Asian without makeup?<br>  <a href="http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y2/oNeHUngRybUnnY/For_Posting_and_BlahBlah/?action=view¤t=04a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s2.photobucket.com/albums/y2/oNeH...</a><br>  <br>  A black without makeup?<br>  <a href="http://s5.photobucket.com/albums/y194/Monkey119/Article/AOL/WithoutMakeup/?action=view¤t=beyonce.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s5.photobucket.com/albums/y194/Mo...</a><br>  <br>  A Mexican without makeup?<br>  <a href="http://www.aolcdn.com/aolr/no-makeup-eva-longoria-400a050307.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aolcdn.com/aolr/no-makeup-eva...</a>|`|rlEoPwjEaa	I hardly ever wear makeup...but when i do its usually pretty light...A water based moisturizer for my skin tone.<br>  <br>   mascara on my top and bottom lashes...sometimes i may wear eyeshadow..sometimes not. <br>  <br>  and depending on my mood...either a red gloss...or a red lipstick. I can stick to blue based reds because im very fair skinned.<br>  <br>  but most of the time i wear no makeup just something to keep my lips from getting chapped. I dont think I have too.

It just depends on the person. Thing is, white women age so fast. They tend to sit out in the sun a lot and do the whole tanning thing all the time, so their skin will age faster than a woman who stays inside or who protects her skin from sun damage. The makeup is a confidence booster. I only wish men could see past that. It's a trick!

NwXnzARwaa	Since I was laid-off from my regular job and have seen my real estate career go bust under the Bush administration, I would think anything is better than the past 8 years that created a budget deficit from a surplus through tax cuts for the rich and a war based on fictional WMDs as well as government money lining the pockets of "independent contractors" in Iraq that includes the previous employer of the US Vice-President (Halliburton/KBR) billing the Pentagon $212 million in overcharges that included bills for meals never even served to troops.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	Hold on now.  We've also been told for years that by continually cutting taxes for the rich and for corporations, we will get rid of the deficit like magic -- that didn't work either.  The pot can't call the kettle black.<br>  <br>  But right now, the truth is, consumer spending is at a standstill, and that is knocking the heck out of our economy.

Ve18FAnGaa	you pose a very good question.  ...frankly i don't always expect that in here...j/king(ish).... anyway, i have wondered about it as well.  i tend to think we develop many parts of our culture as defense.  all animals have defense mechanisms to help them survive (usually/largely called instincts) but they usually appear in physical behavior.  our main tools for survival have always been our brains, and our societies (even in the most primitive forms).  so i think we manifested a lot of mechanisms that have to do with protecting the workings of those two things.  we are not the only creatures to have instincts that safeguard these things, but we may have taken it to an entirely new level.<br>  i think religion and the supernatural is part of that.  in terms of survival, it is very helpful to an individual, and society, to be able to carry faith in something.  the fact that both the supernatural and religion itself are found in every native culture world wide reinforces that to me.  <br>  you are right, it is something people will 'cling' to.  its almost like a default setting because it is wired so deeply in us, and then reinforced by being raised in a culture that accepts these things.  eventually i suspect people would just find substitutes for religion.  they would exibit the same kind of behavior but replace the centerpiece with something new.  kind of like when some of us atheists start to put too much faith in everything scientists or teachers say.  <br>  because of all of these things, i do not see a time when people do not search for some type of religion or faith.  we would do well though none the less to encourage people to be as self actualized as possible so we can each realize more of the potential you spoke of.  like you said, its part of our psyche.  it always will be so lets just work with it as best we can.|`|ee56e9cb7d1592dfa375e3042d398350aa	Religion was invented to explain what was at the time unexplainable.

Its self-evident|`|AA10556726	There are many reasons for "belief", "religion", and thinking that life has a "purpose" or meaning.  This does not mean that we need those things to be social creatures or that religion or belief fulfills anything other than the purposes we give it.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, indulging in these things blinds us to reality and learning about it.|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	“Reality is what we take to be true. What we take to be true is what we believe. What we believe is based upon our perceptions. What we perceive depends upon what we look for. What we look for depends upon what we think. What we think depends upon what we perceive. What we perceive determines what we believe. What we believe determines what we take to be true. what we take to be true is our reality.”<br>  <br>  ---Gary Zukav|`|5UJSX3vJaa	The origin of religious belief is something of a mystery, but in recent years scientists have started to make suggestions. One leading idea is that religion is an evolutionary adaptation that makes people more likely to survive and pass their genes onto the next generation. In this view, shared religious belief helped our ancestors form tightly knit groups that cooperated in hunting, foraging and childcare, enabling these groups to outcompete others. In this way, the theory goes, religion was selected for by evolution, and eventually permeated every human society|`|AA12360579	Atheists can still believe in karma, and a spirit of the universe.  As long as there's no God involved, they're good.<br>  <br>  Anyway, religion developed because humans couldn't understand how things worked in the past.  They thought syphilis was God's way of cursing them, among other such things.

ARE YOU SERIOUS?<br>  <br>  If you don't like your job, quit.  If you don't feel you are being treated fairly, file a complaint, you will be fired soon enough.  Do you really need a public forum to tell you this.  Quit your damn whining.  What is it about women, always with the "the world is so unfair to me" and "I do everything around here, and no one appreciates me".  Its not just you, it is ALL of you.  What should you do?  File a complaint, if there is no HR dept. or he has no supervisor, file a complaint with the EEOC department in your state.  However, I would be careful about making the accusation that they are better looking than you, and that is the basis for your "mistreatment".  I don't think ugly is a protected class.  However, I doubt you are ugly, and I doubt they are pretty either.  I think you just have low self esteem, which may be why your boss thinks you act like a child.  If a production worker is giving you a hard time, why do you need to talk to his supervisor?  Handle it with the production worker.  Sometimes, life is not fair.  Mine sure as hell is not.  Someone must have lied to you and told you that it was fair.<br>  <br>  Also, just as a matter of respect for you, I need to tell you to NOT TAKE ANY ADVISE FROM PINKISH.

But what your going through isn't acceptable either. That's sexually harassment your putting with and plenty of more. So, it's up to you to report something girl. As women we often get put in situations in office that isn't acceptable at all but we most of the time don't know how to handle it cause we need the job. Stand up for your rights and take that man to court you will win but first record some to the problems you are having with out anyone knowing is cause when it comes down to it you will be alone in it nobody else will stand up for you.

The Supreme court justified it by saying there could be separate but equal facilities such as schools, hospitals and so on.  Later, it was determined impossible to have separate but EQUAL for blacks and whites. Whites had been getting the best all along because they were already living the privileged American way of life.

Les prophetes donnent des lois pour differencier le peuple Juif des peuples paiens qui les entoure afin que ce peuple soit different et ne puisse pas se meler aux autres ( tres impurs a l'epoque). C'était la condition pour que Dieu puisse se révéler à un peuple qui évolue vers la Sagesse et qui se laisse modeler par l'amour de Dieu.

Jésus est venu remplacé les anciens sacrifices. Vrai Dieu et vrai homme, il rachète enfin l'humanité de ses péchés. Dès lors le sang versé dans les holocaustes n'est plus nécessaire, seul celui du Christ a valeur rédemptrice. Consommer kasher n'est donc plus nécessaire.<br>  <br>  Par ailleurs, pour les catholiques, à ne pas confondre avec les chrétiens en général, Jésus est bien vrai Dieu et il se déclare tel notamment dans Jean 8, 58: avant qu'Abraham fut, je suis. (cfr; je suis celui qui est à Mo?se).<br>  <br>  Et il fallait qu'il en fut ainsi, car le péché offense une personne infinie et nécessite un sacrifice de valeur infinie pour racheter l'humanité. Le sacrifice d'un homme n'est pas suffisant. Dieu s'est donc incarné en Jésus Christ, vrai Dieu et vrai homme, qui en mourant sur la croix (en tant qu'homme) réalise un sacrifice de valeur infinie (en tant que Dieu).|`|b652df6bdbeace5f22b2f283711c47eaaa	ben on le sais c'est pas un scoop!, il est fils de Dieu, pour schématiser c'est le vrp de dieu , il représente dieu , mais c'est pas dieu, voilà<br>  <br>  il  a plusieurs Q/R faites sur ce sujet, mais on peux y retourner si tu veux, jésus est a la base un type normal  a ce détail prés qu'il est d'ascendance divine non pas par la chaire mais par l'esprit, donc il parles de Dieu parce qu'il l'est, il le représente et Dieu  parle par son intermédiaire, donc d'une manière il est dieu tout en étant son fils mais en ne l'étant pas physiquement.... voilà,|`|e2cf1b0ee6a307d2d6d19bbd77bbcf96aa	La bible,DANS LA MESURE OU ELLE EST TRADUITE CORRECTEMENT, est composée de l'ancien et du nouveau testament,les écrits qui se trouvent dans l'ancien testament ont été écrit à la suite de révélations accordées à différents prophètes par JEHOVA(qui traduit de l'hébreux veut dire:JE SUIS).Le nouveau testament raconte la naissance,la vie la mort,et la résurrection de JESUS,LE CHRIST.Il est l'alpha et l'oméga:jésus vient de josué traduit de l'hébreux...JAHVE soit JEHOVA.Il dit lui-meme:" Je suis celui qui est"(je suis).Il s'agit bien de la meme personne qui a donné des lois en un certain temps pour des hébreux qui avaient le" cou roide"! (la tete dure).Quand il est venu sur terre,Il n'a pas changé ses propres lois mais les a élevé à un niveau supérieur de spiritualité,donc de compréhension plus élevée.Par exemple: pour se faire pardonner leurs fautes les hébreux devaient offir un animal en holocauste ,la loi de consécration du CHRIST nous demande d' offir un coeur repentant et un esprit contrit,ce qui demande plus de sincérité et de dicipline car personne ne peux vérifier si l'on est repentant ou pas...ET je me permetrais de ne pas lire au premier degré la bible, d'y chercher un sens plus élevé,vous pensez bien que le sang d'un cheval n'est pas le sang" réel" du CHRIST.Le sang a un sens très symbolique,méditez et relisez ,et surtout tentez de prier DIEU avant de lire afin qu'il ouvre votre compréhension ,essayez sincèrement et vous serez surpris, je suis chrétienne, mais pas témoin de JEHOVA.Bonne lecture ! ! !|`|ea474a422fe61cbaa4f39bb640349224aa	C'est justement pour bien accentuer sa réforme de l'Ancien-Testament que Jésus nous a donné son sang.<br>  A partir de Jésus, le royaume de Dieu n'est plus réservé à une seule race.|`|07baca48a25041de57d72d575df39d2aaa	Jésus est Dieu. En lui, toute la plénitude de la déité s'est plue à habiter corporellement, il est le resplendissement de la gloire divine et l'empreinte même de sa substance (Colossiens, Hebreux). Pas Dieu le Père mais Il est Dieu dans le sens où son essence est divine. Dieu est un mais pourtant trois personnes distinctes: Dieu le Père, Dieu le Fils et Dieu le Saint Esprit. <br>  <br>  Cette distinction n'est visible que dans le nouveau testament parce que dans l'ancien, Dieu n'avait pas décidé de se révéler pleinement à l'homme. Or, quelle manière plus glorieuse et plus parlante de se révéler aux hommes qu'en devenant lui-même homme ?<br>  <br>  Tu confonds les périodes. Dieu est un, Dieu ne change pas, il ne se contredit pas, seulement il parle aux hommes de manière différente selon la période. Ainsi dans l'ancien testament, on voit Dieu donner la Loi (les 10 commandements bien connus plus un certain nombre de préceptes auxquels tu fais allusion). Pourquoi ? Pour prouver une fois pour toutes que l'homme ne peut en aucune manière s'approcher de lui par ses propres moyens.  En effet, transgresser un seul commandement de la Loi, c'est transgresser toute la Loi. Cette preuve de l'incapacité faite, Dieu montre son amour  : "puisque l'homme ne peut pas s'élever vers Lui, Lui va s'abaisser vers l'homme". La loi a rempli son r?le de démonstration, la période change, elle est maintenant la période de la Grace (Gratuité).<br>  <br>  Désormais, il n'est plus question de se rapprocher de Dieu en "faisant" (de toutes fa?ons personne ne peut faire QUE le bien dans sa vie), mais en "croyant". En croyant quoi ? Que justement, je n'ai pas de moyen de m'approcher de Dieu tout seul et qu'il a fallu le sacrifice d'une victime parfaite, son Fils, Dieu lui-même incarné en homme, pour me sauver...|`|1940a07809d2b3feb363d59941c32912aa	Page principale  Contact  Index Coran  Recherche Coran  Livre d'or  <br>   <br>  Sourate 3<br>  AL-IMRAN (LA FAMILLE D'IMRAN) <br>  200 versets<br>  Pré-Hégire<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Au nom d'Allah, le Tout Miséricordieux, le Très Miséricordieux.<br>  <br>  1.  à  32.<br>  <br>  33. Certes, Allah a élu Adam, Noé, la famille d'Abraham et la famille d'Imran au-dessus de tout le monde.<br>  <br>  34. En tant que descendants les uns des autres, et Allah est Audient et Omniscient.<br>  <br>  35. (Rappelle-toi) quand la femme d'Imran dit : "Seigneur, je T'ai voué en toute exclusivité ce qui est dans mon ventre. Accepte-le donc, de moi. C'est Toi certes l'Audient et l'Omniscient".<br>  <br>  36. Puis, lorsqu'elle en eut accouché, elle dit : "Seigneur, voilà que j'ai accouché d'une fille"; or Allah savait mieux ce dont elle avait accouché! Le gar?on n'est pas comme la fille. "Je l'ai nommée Marie, et je la place, ainsi que sa descendance, sous Ta protection contre le Diable, le banni" <br>  <br>  37. Son Seigneur l'agréa alors du bon agrément, la fit cro?tre en belle croissance. Et Il en confia la garde à Zacharie . Chaque fois que celui-ci entrait auprès d'elle dans le Sanctuaire, il trouvait près d'elle de la nourriture. Il dit : "? Marie, d'où te vient cette nourriture? " - Elle dit : "Cela me vient d'Allah". Il donne certes la nourriture à qui Il veut sans compter.<br>  <br>  38. Alors, Zacharie pria son Seigneur, et dit : "? mon Seigneur, donne-moi, venant de Toi, une excellente descendance. Car Tu es Celui qui entend bien la prière".<br>  <br>  39. Alors, les Anges l'appelèrent pendant que, debout, il priait dans le Sanctuaire : "Voilà qu'Allah t'annonce la naissance de Yahya, confirmateur d'une parole d'Allah . Il sera un chef, un chaste, un prophète et du nombre des gens de bien".<br>  <br>  40. Il dit : "? mon Seigneur, comment aurais-je un gar?on maintenant que la vieillesse m'a atteint et que ma femme est stérile?". Allah dit : "Comme cela! ", Allah fait ce qu'Il veut.<br>  <br>  41. - "Seigneur, dit Zacharie, donne-moi un signe." - " Ton signe, dit Allah, c'est que pendant trois jours tu ne pourras parler aux gens que par geste. Invoque beaucoup Ton Seigneur; et, glorifie-Le, en fin et en début de journée."<br>  <br>  42. (Rappelle-toi) quand les Anges dirent : "? Marie, certes Allah t'a élue au-dessus des femmes des mondes.<br>  <br>  43. "? Marie, obéis à Ton Seigneur, prosterne-toi, et incline-toi avec ceux qui s'inclinent" .<br>  <br>  44. - Ce sont là des nouvelles de l'Inconnaissable que Nous te révélons. Car tu n'étais pas là lorsqu'ils jetaient leurs calames pour décider qui se chargerait de Marie! Tu n'étais pas là non plus lorsqu'ils se disputaient .<br>  <br>  45. (Rappelle-toi,) quand les Anges dirent : "? Marie, voilà qu'Allah t'annonce une parole de Sa part : son nom sera "al-Masih" "Hissa", fils de Marie, illustre ici-bas comme dans l'au-delà, et l'un des rapprochés d'Allah" .<br>  <br>  46. Il parlera aux gens, dans le berceau et en son age m?r et il sera du nombre des gens de bien".<br>  <br>  47. - Elle dit : "Seigneur! Comment aurais-je un enfant, alors qu'aucun homme ne m'a touchée? " - "C'est ainsi! " dit-Il. Allah crée ce qu'Il veut. Quand Il décide d'une chose, Il lui dit seulement : "Sois"; et elle est aussit?t.<br>  <br>  48. "Et (Allah) lui enseignera l'écriture, la sagesse , la Thora et l'?vangile,<br>  <br>  49. et Il sera le messager aux enfants d'Isra?l, [et leur dira]: "En vérité, je viens à vous avec un signe de la part de votre Seigneur. Pour vous, je forme de la glaise comme la figure d'un oiseau, puis je souffle dedans : et, par la permission d'Allah, cela devient un oiseau. Et je guéris l'aveugle-né et le lépreux, et je ressuscite les morts, par la permission d'Allah. Et je vous apprends ce que vous mangez et ce que vous amassez dans vos maisons. Voilà bien là un signe, pour vous, si vous êtes croyants! <br>  <br>  50. Et je confirme ce qu'il y a dans la Thora révélée avant moi, et je vous rends licite une partie de ce qui était interdit. Et j'ai certes apporté un signe de votre Seigneur. Craignez Allah donc, et obéissez-moi.<br>  <br>  51. Allah est mon Seigneur et votre Seigneur. Adorez-Le donc : voilà le chemin droit."<br>  <br>  52. Puis, quand Jésus ressentit de l'incrédulité de leur part, il dit : "Qui sont mes alliés dans la voie d'Allah? " Les ap?tres dirent : "Nous sommes les alliés d'Allah. Nous croyons en Allah. Et sois témoin que nous Lui sommes soumis.<br>  <br>  53. Seigneur! Nous avons cru à ce que Tu as fait descendre et suivi le messager. Inscris-nous donc parmi ceux qui témoignent" .<br>  <br>  54. Et ils [les autres] se mirent à comploter. Allah a fait échouer leur complot. Et c'est Allah qui sait le mieux leur machination ! <br>  <br>  55. (Rappelle-toi) quand Allah dit : "? Jésus, certes, Je vais mettre fin à ta vie terrestre t'élever vers Moi, te débarrasser de ceux qui n'ont pas cru et mettre jusqu'au Jour de la Résurrection, ceux qui te suivent au-dessus de ceux qui ne croient pas. Puis, c'est vers Moi que sera votre retour, et Je jugerai, entre vous, ce sur quoi vous vous opposiez.<br>  <br>  56. Quant à ceux qui n'ont pas cru, Je les chatierai d'un dur chatiment, ici-bas tout comme dans l'au-delà; et pour eux pas de secoureurs.<br>  <br>  57. Et quant à ceux qui ont la foi et font de bonnes oeuvres, Il leur donnera leurs récompenses. Et Allah n'aime pas les injustes.<br>  <br>  58. Voilà ce que Nous te récitons des versets et de la révélation précise .<br>  <br>  59. Pour Allah, Jésus est comme Adam qu'Il créa de poussière, puis Il lui dit "Sois" : et il fut.<br>  <br>  60. La vérité vient de ton Seigneur. Ne sois donc pas du nombre des sceptiques.<br>  <br>  61. A ceux qui te contredisent à son propos, maintenant que tu en es bien informé, tu n'as qu'à dire : "Venez, appelons nos fils et les v?tres, nos femmes et les v?tres, nos propres personnes et les v?tres, puis proférons exécration réciproque en appelant la malédiction d'Allah sur les menteurs .<br>  <br>  62. Voilà, certes, le récit véridique. Et il n'y a pas de divinité à part Allah. En vérité, c'est Allah qui est le Puissant, le Sage.<br>  <br>  63. Si donc ils tournent le dos... alors Allah conna?t bien les semeurs de corruption! <br>  <br>  64. - Dis : "? gens du Livre, venez à une parole commune entre nous et vous : que nous n'adorions qu'Allah, sans rien Lui associer, et que nous ne prenions point les uns les autres pour seigneurs en dehors d'Allah". Puis, s'ils tournent le dos, dites : "Soyez témoins que nous, nous sommes soumis".<br>  <br>  65. ? gens du Livre, pourquoi disputez-vous au sujet d'Abraham, alors que la Thora et l'?vangile ne sont descendus qu'après lui? Ne raisonnez-vous donc pas ? <br>  <br>  66. Vous avez bel et bien disputé à propos d'une chose dont vous avez connaissance. Mais pourquoi disputez-vous des choses dont vous n'avez pas connaissance? Or Allah sait, tandis que vous ne savez pas.<br>  <br>  67. Abraham n'était ni Juif ni Chrétien. Il était entièrement soumis à Allah (Musulman).

Il répond là à une accusation précise des Pharisiens qui blamaient ses disciples pour avoir mangé sans s'être lavé les mains. <br>  A l'époque, les chefs religieux juifs avaient ajouté à la Parole écrite de nombreuses traditions orales qu’ils jugeaient indispensables au vrai culte.  En l'occurrence, les Pharisiens ‘ ne mangeaient pas sans s’être lavé les mains jusqu’au coude, tenant ferme la tradition des hommes d’autrefois ’. (Marc 7:3.) Pour eux, ce n’était pas une question d’hygiène, mais un rituel censé avoir un mérite religieux. Jésus indiquait par ses paroles qu'avoir les mains sales étaient un moindre mal si le coeur lui même était impur.<br>  <br>  De plus, la notion d'aliments purs et impurs a été abolie en même temps que la Loi mosa?que (Romains 6:14 ; éphésiens 2:11-16).

6reKmAlXaa	In Jewish belief, it's considered good form to say "Adon" or "The Lord."  They both mean the same thing.  Jewish folks are very careful to make rules that protect the name of The Lord from abuse.  <br>  <br>  It's the same with the Hebrew Language.  It's generally not spoken for just casual conversation.  An exception might be if you live in Isreal and don't speak Arabic.|`|368f082e535b7b984814252c9ae3f975aa	Yes - the Jewish prayers include a section that is recited daily, that states:<br>  <br>  "Slach Lanu Key Fashanu"<br>  <br>  which means<br>  <br>  "Forgive us, for we have sinned."<br>  <br>  You might find it interesting to know that 95% of all Jewish prayers are in the first person plural ("Forgive US, for WE have sinned)".  This is because the Jewish people are considered like one body, if one part sins then the whole body was involved. <br>  <br>  Only about 5% of Jewish prayers are personal, the word "I" rarely appears, it's almost only "WE", "US" etc.|`|4d1572760dbbe672371296295ce2ffdcaa	I HAVE COME FORTH FOR YOUR BLESSING,O LORD OF HOSTS,FOR I HAVE BEEN LOST.|`|d2a383c39b3b208bfabae696fef5a7e7aa	before i translate that into jewish, you need to translate your question into english. lol.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  okay, well going by the above answer's interpretation of what you would like to know, i would say that i would not naturally use the word L-rd in that sentence, i would say "Hashem" instead. but i probably wouldn't say that sentence in the first place because it sounds extremely catholic.|`|62989e0e9664c797d0752bc9779b7193aa	as jewish girl said, its not something a jewish person would generally say. we ask for help, but we generally don't feel bogged down with sins. we focus on the here and now and doing better in the future. <br>  <br>  p.s. hebrew is a language. jewish is a religion/society

Ceci n'étant pas propre à l'Islam, je pense que les religions ne sont présentes que pour répondre à la peur viscérale que l'homme a de la mort. L'idée de ne plus exister lui étant insupportable, il s'est forgé un aprés pour lutter contre la déprime de savoir que sa vie lui serait finalement retiré sans autre forme de procés. Les membres dirigeants de ces religions en ont alors profité pour édicter des règles sous couvert de commandements divins.<br>  Ainsi l'interdiction de manger du porc pour les juifs et les musulmans vient du fait que cette viande était la plus propagatrice de maladie aux années de leurs créations respectives. La polygamie était justifiée par le fait qu'en temps de guerre nombre de femmes restaient sans mari. La réincarnation bouddhiste incitait les gens fortunés à se montrer plus compatissant envers les pauvres qu'ils avaient dus être dans une vie antérieure.<br>  Pour finir chaque religion monothéiste a engendré des extrèmismes dangereux, l'inquisiton chez les catholiques, la guerre sainte chez les musulmans, georges bush chez les protestants, même les bouddhistes ont des extrèmistes au Sri lanka. <br>  Tout ?a n'est qu'une question de pouvoir.|`|43e7fd4732a08f567e3a2826393d6232aa	Alcuin, un moine à l'époque de Charlemagne, affirmait que la foi est affaire de liberté et non de contrainte. Il ne s'agit donc pas, pour un croyant, de forcer les autres à partager leur foi. Tout au plus pourra-t-il les y inviter en leur partageant ce qui le fait vivre et en témoignant de sa foi par ses actes. Cela n'exclut pas l'échange d'arguments mais il est rare que celui-ci aboutisse à des conversions. Pascal, un grand croyant, ne disait-il pas lui-même (je cite de mémoire) qu'il y a toujours suffisamment de lumière pour croire et toujours suffisamment d'obscurité pour douter...|`|6155d68772dbbd0c22de55ac178ddc21aa	Y a rien de pire que le prosélytisme.

Elles ont nécessairement un créateur qui leur a accordé l'existence , du fait qu'elles ne peuvent se créer elles-mêmes ni exister par hasard, et qu'avant leur existence, elles étaient inexistantes.<br>  Donc, comment peuvent-elles être créatrices ? Il est impossible d'exister par hasard car, pour tout accident il faut une cause. Leur existence au sein d'un système aussi merveilleux, d'une coordination harmonieuse, d'un rapport homogène et cohérent entre les causes et leurs effets.<br>  Donc, si les créatures ne se créent pas elles-mêmes, et si ce n'est pas le hasard non plus, elles se rendent compte qu'elles ont un créateur, qui n'est autre que Dieu?<br>  <br>  l'existence de Dieu par les révélations:<br>  Tous les Livres Révélés affirment l'existence de Dieu. Les préceptes qu'ils contiennent, destinés au profit de la création sont autant de preuves que tout cela provient d'un Seigneur et Ma?tre doué d'une Infinie Sagesse et qui a connaissance des affaires de Sa Création. <br>  Egalement les informations qu'ils véhiculent concernant l'univers, dont la réalité atteste la véracité, sont autant de Signes prouvant leur provenance d'un Seigneur capable de donner existence à tout ce qu'Il a mentionné dans Son Livre.<br>  <br>  Alors, croire en Dieu, en Boudha, en Jehovah,croire qu'on se réincarnera, croire en soi, au libre-arbitre, au destin, au karma, finalement. <br>  Seule la force que la croyance nous apporte est importante. Elle nous permet d'apprécier ce qui nous est offert, jour après jour, heure après heure. Elle est le moteur de notre esprit d'aventure, d'apprentissage, notre carburant de vie.<br>  <br>  Croire, c'est vivre. Et en être conscient. Tout simplement et c'est à toi de cherchere autour de toi tes convictions.|`|07baca48a25041de57d72d575df39d2aaa	On ne peut convaincre personne. C'est le principe même de la foi, croire ce qui n'est pas démontrable.<br>  <br>  Une piste quand même: <br>  Imagine que tu as un jardin bien soigné, ce jardin tu le laisses à l'abandon pendant trois ans. Penses-tu que les choses vont "s'ordonner" toutes seules, vont-elles s'organiser ? Non évidemment, les choses vont aller dans le sens de plus de désordre (Entropie croissante pour les physiciens).<br>  Maintenant, aligne des milliards de milliards d'atomes issus du Big Bang, imagines tu qu'ils vont se grouper, s'associer, se coordonner tous seuls pour créer une chose vivante ? Pas moi...<br>  <br>  Le fait même de "la vie", du passage de l'inanimé à l'animé, est une vraie question posée à ceux qui ne croient pas en Dieu...|`|202ddeb32ba734770f4dcae9ace6a2dbaa	c'est exactement comme une usine qui fait la synthèse d'un produit utile, et la panique survienne si l'usine manque d'un gestionnaire.<br>  c'est facile de dire à telle chose ?a n'existe pas mais un peu de réflexion  sur les données basés sur l'existence.|`|2n8zLHAFaa	C'est un sujet sensible et bien trop personnel.<br>  Rien ne s'impose, tout se propose...<br>  <br>  Force est de constaté que dans la grande majorité de nos religions dites monothéistes, Dieu est considéré comme un Sur-Homme siégeant sur un tr?ne situé quelque part dans le ciel et se comportant à l'égard des hommes comme un père envers ses enfants. Voilà pourquoi de plus en plus de personnes ne se reconnaissent pas dans cette "définition".|`|7cd5615a89abd08dc2dc80c4f212d102aa	Faut rien faire, il est inutile de vouloir convaincre ceux qui ne croient pas, faut juste respecter leur athéisme et leur foutre la paix.

C'est là que les scientifiques placent la naissance de l'univers. La suite n'est donc pas éternelle. Elle a une origine.<br>  Cependant il existe quelque chose d'éternel car sinon il n'existerait rien maintenant non plus: en effet si a un moment du temps rien n'existait alors rien n'aurait jamais existé car rien ne peut sortir du néant.<br>  Il existe quelque chose d'éternel et ce n'est pas notre monde matériel. Il s'agit donc de quelque chose de spirituel que les croyants appelent Dieu.<br>  Ce Dieu est al cause première a l'origine de toute chose en ce monde. Lui-même n'est pas le résultat de quelque chose qui l'a précédé puisqu'il est éternel. Ne recevant aucun influx extérieur, il est immuable càd il ne change pas. Il est également parfait car s'ilne l'était pas cela voudrait dire qu'il serait susceptible de s'améliorer suite à une cause extérieure à lui-même ce qui n'est pas possible puisqu'il est immuable et éternel.<br>  Voilà pour l'aspet philosophique.<br>  Quand je regarde la nature moi de mon c?té je suis convaincu que Dieu existe: quand je regarde une montre dans toute sa complexité, j'imagine l'horloger qui l'a fabriquée.

( J'ai 71 ans demain.)<br>  La foi en Dieu c'est comme l'amour: fondamentalement l'un comme l'autre ont besoin de la liberté au départ. C'est aussi simple que cela.<br>  Les deux sont "relation".<br>  La question de la nature, oui, c'est le stade : il existe ou il existe pas?<br>  Qui a créé l'univers et qui lui a donné ses lois. Einstein ( je sais, il n'est pas Dieu et peut se tromper ) disait en regardant par la fenêtre: " Tout de même, tout ?a ne peut pas être le fruit du hasard ! - Contrairement à ce que prétendait Monod - Il faut bien qu'il y ait un Créateur!" <br>  Mais ce n'est pas là avoir foi en Dieu... C'est croire que Dieu existe, c'est tout et c'est le début, peut-être...<br>  Conclusion: on ne peut surtout pas convaincre et c'est très bien comme ?a. Liberté chérie!...<br>  Se poser la question comme ?a, il n'y a que l'être humain pour se la poser.<br>  Joyeux courage!

Mais si ton coeur est fertile comme une bonne terre la parole germera et portera du fruit.<br>  Tout dépend donc de ton coeur.<br>  Jésus t'aime|`|be14d340202aed4903e63a3fad2d11b4aa	Franchement je suis croyant ; et il ne me viendrait pas à l'idée de chercher à te convaincre de l'existence de dieux. D'ailleurs "convaincre" par opposition à "persuader", signifie pousser une personne à se ranger à notre avis en recourant à des arguments qui font appel à l'intellect de cette personne.<br>  La persuasion fait appel aux émotions de la cible.<br>  Non je ne chercherai pas à te convaincre. Mon père qui est athée à cherché à me montrer tant bien que mal l'absurdité de la religion. Il n'y est pas parvenu.<br>  Je suis un scientifique, et plus j'en ai appris sur le monde, les mécanismes de la vie, plus j'ai trouvé ce système bien foutu. Cette connaissance n'a pas ébranlé mes convictions. J'adhère totalement aux théories de Darwin et pour moi l'aveuglement de nombreux corréligionnaires à nier les théories de l'évolution est risible. Autant ne pas croire que la télévision qu'on a dans le salon existe.<br>  Dieu on le sens ou on le sens pas. C'est pour ?a que je suis anti-prosélytisme. Comment amener quelqun à sentir quelquechose à laquelle il n'est pas réceptif ? On risque de faire de lui un homme creux comme un arbre mort.<br>  Moi je crois en Dieu parce que je crois que la vie a un sens et qu'elle est remplie de signaux qui me montrent comment m'élever. J'essaie comme les Cabalistes le disent de "regarder la réalité les yeux grand ouverts pour pouvoir voir au delà".<br>  Dans mes succès comme dans mes échecs j'apprends. Et je suis persuadé que quelqun m'observe et sais où j'en suis.<br>  Tu vois ? Je ne t'ai parlé ni de paradis, ni d'enfer... la plupart des croyants se focalisent sur ?a. En fait c'est parce qu'il veulent quelquechose en échange de la part de Dieu. C'est un grand marchandage. Je suis un bon ch'tit nenfant et je collectionne les Hit points, et au final tu me DOIS le paradis. C'est écris dans le contrat. Je suis s?r que Dieu à la fin des temps va se faire attquer en jsutice par tous ces procédurier quelque soit leur religion. Ils diront "article V alinéa 7 il est stipulé que j'ai dépassé le seuil des 799 point de piété, si on ajoute l'exonération de TVA religieuse il faut rajouter 15%"...."Citoyen Dieu veuillez prendre vos responsabilité ou nous vous poursuivrons en contentieux".<br>  En gros la masse des croyants c'est ?a.

Das Wort Engel kommt vom lateinischem "Angelus" und bedeutet "Bote", also ein Bote Gottes.

El papel de mesías en la nueva religión, Hitler se lo reservó para sí mismo. <br>  <br>  Hesemann considera que la retórica religiosa del nacionalsocialismo era más que una estrategia de propaganda, y que tanto Hitler como sus seguidores más leales estaban convencidos de actuar siguiendo la voluntad de Dios o de la providencia.<br>  <br>  El nacionalsocialismo, para Hesemann, en último término no es otra cosa que la puesta en práctica, en el terreno de la política, de una serie de corrientes esotéricas del siglo XIX entre las que se cuenta la teosofía, la ariosofía y el wagnerianismo.<br>  <br>  Hasemann asegura que casi toda la elite del Tercer Reich estudió intensivamente las doctrinas esotéricas de Richard Wagner y la mística neo-gnóstica, y algunos pertenecieron incluso a sociedades ocultistas.<br>  <br>  En el libro se asegura que ante todo, la doctrina neo-gnóstica fue clave en el desarrollo del antisemitismo eliminatorio, debido a su visión del dios de los judíos como un dios inferior, visto como infernal e identificado con el demonio.<br>  <br>  Hesemann manifestó en la presentación del libro que la dimensión religiosa del nacionalsocialismo estuvo en un segundo plano durante mucho tiempo debido a que o bien se veía a la religión como algo a lo sumo secundario, o se idealizaba y no se tomaban en cuenta sus elementos destructivos.<br>  <br>  "Con el 11 de septiembre (de 2001) volvimos a tener consciencia de los elementos destructivos de la religión", dijo Hesemann, en alusión a los ataques perpetrados por células de Al Qaeda que decían actuar en nombre de Alá (Dios). <br>  <br>  Esa fecha, según el autor, "nos ha ense?ado que la religión es algo más que creencia personal" y que constituye "un poder que puede llevar a los humanos a lo más sublime o a lo más bajo, siempre con la promesa de la redención".|`|a281d682d52904e2721c6ffa9507ca43aa	ATEO el cien por ciento|`|d1307b6bfb6f71c93003a99d5b224edfaa	TJ.|`|e97aaa713f98e3eaf9bd0be45f770f04aa	El protestantismo es la religion del norte y <br>  es la iglesia oficial de hitler.

Mais parfois, ce ne sont pas les personnes qu'ils jugent, seulement leur péché. Par exemple, si un chrétien condamne l'homosexualité, en tant que faute grave, ce n'est pas pour autant qu'il ne respecte pas les homosexuels en tant que personnes. Par exemple l'association David et Jonathan, qui est chrétienne, les écoute et les aide. Un chrétien condamne la prostitution mais aidera les prostituées dans des associations de soutien. Je pourrais donner des exemples similaires pour l'avortement , que les chrétiens condamnent comme péché grave, mais qui, dans le même temps, ouvrent les portes de groupes d'entraide pour les mère ayant avorté. Et, les chrétiens qui ont suivi le Concile Vatican II, savent que dans toute religion, il y a une parcelle de vérité, et respectent toutes les religions ainsi que tout homme, quel qu'il soit.

5e7071ae63241269acbf6184afc6dceaaa	Judas no fue el traidor que vendió a Jesús por unas monedas, sino el discípulo privilegiado al que encarga la misión más difícil, sacrificarlo, según un documento llamado el “Evangelio de Judas”.<br>    Es un papiro de 26 páginas que fue encontrado en Egipto en 1978 y que ha rodado desde entonces por los círculos de anticuarios, pero cuyo contenido y edad se desconocían. <br>    La organización National Geographic dio a conocer los resultados de su restauración y traducción. Los análisis de carbono 14, la tinta, el estilo de escritura y el contenido han hecho llegar a la conclusión de que se trata de un texto escrito alrededor del a?o 300. <br>    El códice contiene la única copia del “ Evangelio de Judas ” , en una traducción al copto del original en griego. <br>    Por ello, Terry Garcia, vicepresidente ejecutivo de National Geographic, lo calificó en una rueda de prensa como uno de los tres textos antiguos más importantes descubiertos en el último siglo, junto con los manuscritos del Mar Muerto y los de Nag Hammadi (Egipto) . <br>    Se conocía de la existencia del “ Evangelio de Judas ” por una referencia hecha por el obispo Irineo de Lyon en el a?o 180 en su tratado “ Contra la herejía ” . <br>    Pero hasta ahora nadie sabía lo que decía. Su mensaje transforma totalmente la figura de Judas Iscariote, que es el prototipo de la traición y la mentira en la Cristiandad. <br>    El libro comienza así: “El relato secreto de la revelación que Jesús hizo en conversaciones con Judas Iscariote durante una semana antes de que celebrasen la Pascua”. <br>    En él se pinta a Judas como “el único discípulo que conoce la identidad verdadera de Jesús ” , según George Wurst, profesor de la Universidad de Augsburg, en Alemania. <br>    No lo traicionó, “ sino sólo hizo lo que Jesús le pidió ” , afirmó Craig Evans, profesor de Nuevo Testamento de Acadia Divinity College, en Canadá. Así, Jesús dice a Judas en el libro: “ Tú superarás a todos ellos. Tú sacrificarás al hombre que me recubre ” . <br>    El texto se encuadra en la tradición de los cristianos gnósticos, que enfatizaban la importancia del conocimiento: gnosis, en griego. <br>    No se trata del concepto actual de conocimiento, sino de un conocimiento espiritual, de lo divino dentro del ser humano, que permite a la esencia de la persona escapar de la prisión del cuerpo y elevarse al espacio celestial. <br>    Por ello, Judas, al entregar a Jesús a la muerte, facilita su salida del cuerpo y la liberación de la divinidad que llevaba dentro, según explicó Wurst. <br>    No es la primera vez que se ha lanzado la hipótesis de que Judas actuó por indicación de su maestro al venderlo con un beso, como refleja la película “ La última tentación de Cristo ” . <br>    Sin embargo, se trata del primer documento antiguo que defiende esta visión. <br>    Evans recuerda que en dos ocasiones Jesús pidió cosas en privado a dos de sus discípulos, según el Nuevo Testamento, y se pregunta si su entrega a las autoridades judías por parte de Judas no sería una tercera. <br>  <br>  “ Es posible que el Evangelio de Judas fuera preservado en la memoria y que los otros discípulos no lo supieran ” , dijo. <br>  <br>    Elaine Pagels, profesora de la Universidad de Princeton (EU), destaca que los cuatro Evangelios aceptados por el canon cristiano relatan los actos públicos de Jesús, pero no conversaciones privadas. <br>    Sin embargo, no es de esperar que se lea el Evangelio de Judas desde el púlpito en la Semana Santa. <br>    El padre Donald Senior, presidente de la Unión Católica de Teología de EU, dijo que este texto no se ancla en ninguna tradición histórica. <br>    A su juicio, usa los personajes de los libros canónicos, pero “ es una expresión de una teología específica ” , la gnóstica, en su concepción del cuerpo humano y la creación, que son muy diferentes a la de los Evangelios aceptados por la Iglesia Católica. <br>    Quién lo escribió es otro misterio. En ningún lugar se dice que fuera Judas, pero eso no debería hacer dudar de su veracidad, pues la autoría de los Evangelios del Nuevo Testamento tampoco está asegurada. <br>    “La mayoría de los textos son escritos en nombre de alguien más famoso ” , como lo es un discípulo de Jesús, según Marvin Meyer, profesor de la Universidad Chapman, en California. <br>  <br>  Pocos hay tan famosos como Judas.<br>  <br>  ...............votame si te parecio buena la respuesta... no digo q sea cierto... quien sabe, lo q se es q esto se encontro...|`|0e48a8d285724765e059e7ac301e2b0eaa	ALGUIEN TENIA QUE HACER SU PAPEL !|`|7a8dd868925c4732d854879f4b8d27ccaa	mejor entra aqui y lo sabras <a href="http://www.ehui.com/?c=3&a=49935" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehui.com/?c=3&a=49935</a>|`|b1b27487ed5a0da589d24e3602d5129faa	Judas según los evangelios fue un hombre, traidor pero así mismo, y aunque quieran ahora justificarlo no puedes justificar lo injustificable, el hubiera no existe así paso, es como si quisieras justificar las atrocidades de cortes en la conquista y la disque Santa inquisición que Justificaba matar, destruir y martirizar a la gente por no creer o no entender, una religión, que no era la de nuestros naturales, como justificar los actos abominables de la Santa inquisición, queriendo imponer la Fe Cristiana, por la fuerza el odio y el asesinato, si Jesús era, es y siempre sera amor.|`|d261115bcc3bbd9b4abb8c49cf779517aa	Traidor, pero de no haber sido èl el que entregara a Jesus hubiera sido otro pues escrito estaba en a biblia y debia pasar.|`|e19c20f274b25e5f2c0ccffed90ae4f7aa	yo  creo q era un mal nesesario ya q jesus sabia ya q habia un traidor.Es un mal nesesario para dar una lecsiion a todos los seres humanos.|`|64324dcc1b21c24629df66638343ebedaa	ni una cosa ni la otra. sólo un tipo que tomó una mala decisión y no supo afrontar las consecuencias...|`|6b3fde994adfaacb99cca2c19cb74eb4aa	La existencia del "Evangelio de Judas" era ya conocido por las distintas corrientes del cristianismo y San Ireneo de Lyon se hizo eco, en el a?o 180, de una obra bajo ese nombre en su tratado "Contra la herejía".<br>  <br>  Sin embargo pocos conocían su contenido y durante siglos quedó como uno de esos misterios que acompa?an a todas las religiones. Recientemente, la prestigiosa National Geographic invirtió dos millones de dólares en su recuperación y traducción revelando su contenido, que para algunos cambia totalmente la visión que hasta ahora teníamos de Judas Iscariote y del papel que este jugó durante las últimas horas del padre del cristianismo.<br>  <br>  El libro comienza así: "El relato secreto de la revelación que Jesús hizo en conversaciones con Judas Iscariote durante una semana antes de que celebrasen la Pascua".<br>  <br>  En él se pinta a Judas como "el único discípulo que conoce la identidad verdadera de Jesús", según George Wurst, profesor de la Universidad de Augsburg, en Alemania.<br>  <br>  No lo traicionó, "sino sólo hizo lo que Jesús le pidió", afirmó Craig Evans, profesor de Nuevo Testamento de Acadia Divinity College, en Canadá. Así, Jesús dice a Judas en el libro: "Tú superarás a todos ellos. Tú sacrificarás al hombre que me recubre".<br>  <br>  Los expertos que han analizado los manuscritos explican que según estos, Judas no fue un traidor que vendió a Jesús por treinta monedas de plata, sino el discípulo privilegiado al que encarga la misión más difícil, sacrificarlo para ayudar a su esencia divina a escapar de la prisión del cuerpo y elevarse al espacio celestial entroncando el sacrificio de Jesús con la más pura tradición gnostica.<br>  <br>  ?Obra de una secta?<br>  <br>  Este es uno de los motivos que llevan a algunos expertos expertos a situar este manuscrito como una obra de los Cainitas, una de las corrientes cristianas de la época. Estos entendían el conocimiento (gnosis, del griego conocimiento) como algo espiritual, de lo divino dentro del ser humano, que permite a la esencia de la persona escapar de la prisión del cuerpo y elevarse al espacio celestial.<br>  <br>  Otras corrientes del cristianismo abjuraron de estas teorías y consideraron a los gnosticos como una secta e incluso herejes.<br>  <br>  "Los gnósticos constituían una especie de movimiento de carácter ecléctico, que había integrado elementos del judaísmo, de la religión irania y de la filosofía griega, junto con otros provenientes del cristianismo", dijo al periódico argentino Infobae el teólogo católico Luís Rivas contrario a considerarlos como cristianos.<br>  <br>  "San Ireneo de Lyon, en torno al a?o 180, dijo que existía un libro llamado 'Evangelio de Judas', que no era un 'evangelio' de la Iglesia Católica, sino que se trataba de una obra escrita en el seno de la secta gnóstica de los Cainitas"<br>  <br>  "Es evidente que no es un escrito de Judas, sino de alguien que en el siglo III o IV utilizó su nombre para dar fundamento a las ense?anzas de la secta gnóstica", enfatizó Rivas. <br>  <br>  El biblista a?adió que el contenido del documento "no puede ser tomado como una auténtica tradición proveniente de Jesús, porque aunque se presenta como una palabra dicha en secreto a uno de sus discípulos, no está de acuerdo con lo que el Se?or dijo públicamente, y que se contiene en los cuatro evangelios que la Iglesia tiene desde el comienzo". <br>  <br>  ?No eran cristianos?<br>  <br>  Rivas asevera que "las ense?anzas de la secta (Cainitas) no tenían origen cristiano, y sus miembros no eran reconocidos como 'cristianos'. Con la desaparición de la secta, también se perdieron sus libros". <br>  <br>  "De los cuatro evangelios originales existen copias desde el siglo II. Por esa razón, a la Iglesia no le preocupa el encuentro y la traducción de este texto escrito algunos siglos después, y que no transmite una ense?anza auténtica sino algo elucubrado en el siglo III. No dice otra cosa que lo que pensaba un peque?o grupo sectario, rechazado por los cristianos.<br>  <br>  El padre Donald Senior, presidente de la Unión Católica de Teología de EEUU, dijo que este texto no se ancla en ninguna tradición histórica.<br>  <br>  A su juicio, usa los personajes de los libros canónicos, pero "es una expresión de una teología específica", la gnóstica, en su concepción del cuerpo humano y la creación, que son muy diferentes a la de los Evangelios aceptados por la Iglesia Católica.<br>  <br>  <br>  Por el contrario, Craig Evans, Profesor de Nuevo Testamento en el Academia Divinity College en Wolfville, Nueva Escocia, cree que este evangelio "convierte el acto de traición de Judas en un acto de obediencia", se?aló <br>  <br>  En su opinión, "el sacrificio del cuerpo de Jesús se convirtió en salvación. Por eso, Judas emerge como el héroe y termina siendo envidiado e inclusive insultado por los otros discípulos".<br>  <br>  ?Es plausible lo que dice? Evans recuerda que en dos ocasiones Jesús pidió cosas en privado a dos de sus discípulos, según el Nuevo Testamento, y se pregunta si su entrega a las autoridades judías por parte de Judas no sería una tercera.<br>  <br>  "Es posible que el Evangelio de Judas fuera preservado en la memoria y que los otros discípulos no lo supieran", dijo.<br>  <br>  Quién lo escribió es otro misterio. En ningún lugar se dice que fuera Judas, pero eso no debería hacer dudar de su veracidad, pues la autoría de los Evangelios del Nuevo Testamento tampoco está asegurada.<br>  <br>  "La mayoría de los textos son escritos en nombre de alguien más famoso", como lo es un discípulo de Jesús, según Marvin Meyer, profesor de la Universidad Chapman, en California.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Una larga historia<br>  <br>  Aunque se desconoce quien o quienes fueron los autores del "Evangelio de Judas" si sabemos que los manuscritos datan del siglo III de nuestra era. Así lo demuestran los análisis de carbono 14, la tinta, el estilo de escritura y el contenido de este misterioso libro que muestra otro aspecto del papel del que paso a la historia como el discípulo traidor.<br>  <br>  Según los expertos del National Geographic los manuscritos que fueron hallados en la decada de los 70 serian la traducción al copto de los manuscritos originales escritos en griego. Anteriores a esta fecha, ya que el propio San Ireneo de Lyon ya mencionaba este "Evangelio" en el a?o 180 por lo que seguramente debía haber tenido una cierta difusión en algunos sectores de la cristiandad.<br>  <br>  Su hallazgo se produjo por casualidad. Fue un agricultor egipcio quien los encontró en una gruta situada en una zona desértica próxima a la localidad de Bani Mazar, a unos 190 kilómetros al sur de El Cairo.<br>  El hallazgo consistió en trece papiros envueltos en cuero y fueron vendidos a un traficante ilegal egipcio de arqueología que se los llevó a EEUU, donde los depositó en un banco para venderlos luego a otro contrabandista a quien se los compró en los a?os ochenta la fundación Maecenas, con sede en la ciudad suiza de Basilea.<br>  <br>  Finalmente, la National Geographic ayudo a la recuperación de estos manuscritos y en colaboracion con el Instituto Waitt los restauró y tradujo antes de entregarlos al Estado Egipcio quien los exhibirá al publico en el Museo Copto.<br>  <br>  Terry Garcia, vicepresidente ejecutivo de National Geographic, los calificó como uno de los tres textos antiguos más importantes descubiertos en el último siglo, junto con los manuscritos del Mar Muerto y los de Nag Hammadi (Egipto).<br>  <br>  A pesar de estar escrito en copto este evangelio tampoco es reconocido por la iglesia Copta que al igual que otros brazos del cristianismo solo prestan devoción y validez a los cuatro evangelios históricos: san Juan, san Mateo, san Lucas y san Marcos.

You might not believe in the same God as a Christian, but some sort of higher being.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	Concept of god does not belong to Christianity exclusively.  Other religions have gods too.  Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, etc have gods.  Many Buddhists from India and Sri Lanka believe in Hindu gods and even go to temples and pray to them and worship them.|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Yes it's possible to believe in 'God'.  I am a Christian. One only has to see the beauty of the planet in all its diversity to imagine there must be somthingsomeone  out there bigger than we are.  If one believes in a God one therefore must believe there is evil. Watch out for those spells though they can bring a lot of harm if you don't know what you are dabbling in and how to control it.|`|CQz8dMzFaa	There is only one God, who created us, and who we are all supposed to believe in.

Because if you are, believing in him without being a Christian is not very common, I'd say.<br>  <br>  Which god do you believe in?<br>  Or do you just believe that there might be *some* god out there?<br>  <br>  Consider that.|`|HG5Smxkjaa	I suppose it is possible to believe in a god and not be a Christian....But if you are asking for yourself....I don't know how you could believe in God of the Bible...and be a buddhist...

The reason she is living at home is because she can live free through college. Keeping her student loan amount to a minimum. Example: my friends daughter is living at home.She occasionally works a part time job. Is not interested in college. Not interested in a full time job. Driving her parents car. Sleep's,eats & goes out with friends. She is living at home because she is to lazy to go out & make it on her own so she is living off of family. I don't know your situation but you do.

Denmark as you know is an island and sweden and Norway are connected.  This theory works except when you include Finland.  Their language is more like Russian.|`|AA11445621	Because the Danes are closer to Germany, therefore they share the pronounciation of some things.

I was shot by a drug dealer who freaked out when he saw my fireteam moving up the street.<br>  <br>  I remember the spinning sensation as the round hit, allot of pressure built up as my arm was forced inward toward my body, almost like a squeezing pressure that happened super quick. then i hit the ground on my right side and I remember landing on my M-16, that's where the pain hit, I didn't realize I was shot, I just knew I hurt my ribs falling across my rifle. My buddy Paul charged froward to me firing bursts while Doc Dave dragged me back into a door way, then I went out and woke up in the hospital.|`|xC9SIZbGaa	Being shot, depending on where it is, it feels like a heavy thick pin has been pushed thru ur skin, usually stings more at first. when it hits bone it's like an electric shock that stops you moving. Some people don't even feel the bullet untill it causes them to bleed.<br>  <br>  Being stabbed is worse usually, its more like a piercing burning pain that doesn't bugger off till either someone drugs you or you fall unconscious.|`|aXDRWYKRaa	I got stabbed on the back of my shoulder once.

npTZTzWRaa	No they wouldve been blacks 50 yrs ago during segregation and 150 years ago during slavery, they are still black today, some just dont want to accept or embrace that,they would rather "have the best of both worlds" as many of them say which basically says to me that they dont want to be considered black because of the negative connotations that <br>  <br>  may come along with it<br>  <br>  <br>  Why you want to seperate yourself from the black community now when we as a people have progressed this far is tragic.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  edit- People werent saying that sh*t back in the day, now all of a sudden everybody wants to claim mixed, well hell I think if I was half black I would just say I was black like Obama does because by standard definition YOU ARE BLACK like it or love it, if you had to deal with the same issues that our great grandparents had to overcome you would understand the relevance and significance of that, its the one drop rule baby, like it or love it<br>  <br>  <br>  @Faith- I dont know anyone who waits for handouts there goes your white side refering to blacks again im not stupid<br>  <br>  @Faith- how about you shut up, just because someone is on welfare does not mean they are sitting around for handouts, welfare is there for a reason in case you didnt know,you dont know there situation, stop thinking your better than someone because having your 'holier than thou' attitude makes you the dumbazz, your half white anywayz so you dont fully relate to the black community as I can see, you talk like those crackers,because your  'mixed' and enjoying your "best of both worlds",<br>  <br>  <br>  @Faith- did I make any referance to those abusing the welfare system, I dont believe so, also it kills me how you people act as if a few dollars going to the welfare system is the problem but never comment on your rich white criminals who are the reason we are in a recession, also spare me with that "im more educated than you are" crap, people who think they are better than somebody else because they've acquired  degrees kill me,especially when youve been given ahead start in life in comparison to your 'ghetto' counterparts, its actually quite hilarious how uppity and full of yourselves some of you 'degree holders' can get, you would think with all of that 'school smarts' would come some real wisdom and understanding but it obviously is not always the case,Im glad I know some 'educated' people who are actually down to earth, but you know until you walk in the shoes of  a 'lowly' 'street walking' 'urban' black person you are only on the outside looking in making uneducated assumptions<br>  <br>  Unless youve been there and actually came from nothing to better yourself , then shut up<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I'll add you but you cant educate me, im already aware that there were many causes of the recession,and you can pretend you fully understand every last detail if you want|`|C9QQPROkaa	Just because you wont dismiss your other ethnicity's does not mean you have something against being black david.

I call mixed people mixed, not black nor white!|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	The truth is that would be pretty hard to do because there are so many combinations of bi-racials  black/white (mulatto) , white/Asian (Euraisan) White/Native American  (Métis), black/asian(Blasian), white/Latino, Lation/black  lation/asian etc <br>  <br>  Race should not be an issue at all but since it is I do think there should be caterogires for Multraicals. They could just do Multiracial category  or if they want to break it down to <br>  Bi-racial – 2 races and Multiracial – 3 or more races.  Progress is at least being made as 2000 was the first time that people could check more then one race.<br>  <br>  I am sorry David but it is not for you are anyone else to decide how someone chooses to identify racially. The truth is the multiracial community is growing and you are finding more and more people who are choosing to identify as mixed race regardless what their mixture is or what their skin complexion is.  Even more in the younger generation like people who are under around 33 years old. Why do people think mixies who identify as mixed are self hating?  The majority of us  aren’t we embrace all of our racial backrounds and not just one like many want us too. Why do monoraicals feel offended or threatened by mixed people who choose to identify as what we are mixed raced? <br>  <br>  Many people don’t know this but the US Census use to list mulatto as a separate race that’s right they had white, black and mulatto. It was taken off in 1930 when the started one dropping mulattos and anyone who had black in their racial mixture. <br>  <br>   During the salves days though many mulattos would have been and were slaves they were called mulattos (Quadroon) or sometimes even plantation children. They were rarely called black they were not considered white but nor where they considered black.   One can also look at what they called  “House ******” because the majority of those slaves were mulattos/Quadroons. This was also due to the fact that often because the mulattos were the children of the master and they were often given more opportunities to learn to read and have an education. They many times had better clothing and got more and better food then that field ****** who were mostly black slaves. Some mulattos even had their own property and yes even had slaves themselves.|`|rWqrN7Apaa	I dunno but a classmate of mine just says "Brown" for anyone who doesn't look Asian, White, or Black|`|JwW7j8yYaa	they are|`|ncdTxID9aa	Well we still get stereotyped the same, so it's not like it would make a difference. I'm fine being called biracial or mixed.<br>  <br>  <br>  David, thanks for the thumbs down but shut up about segregation.  Because as I said in another question, if I were born back then, I'd fight for my freedom and not wait for people to fight for me, as some people today wait for some one to hand them education and handouts.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Like I said David, shut up.  I know not one black person from the hood who doesn't know people on welfare even if they aren't. But this is irrelevant to the topic.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  lol Listen to you David defend the people who abuse the welfare system.  I don't refer to all people on welfare that way, but it seems people with Democratic or Liberal views love to ignore the downside of why they support free market, free everything.  No I'm just more educated than you are, has nothing to do with me looking down on people because I met people everyday less fortunate or more successful than me everyday and see them no different. I judge character which is human.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:   Are you done ranting David?  How about you add me and educate yourself on recession, we can discuss that another time, and as for the rest of your statements, give it a rest.  I'm so uppidy but I bet I contribute more to your type of communities than you do dear. Just give it a rest

c3c4c8a2074ae0650a9eda853f4c66a3aa	I hope that one day they will be accepted<br>  <br>  I hate some homophobes views on gay people<br>  <br>  I have strong opinions on this topic<br>  that go as follows<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is not an abomination. I am a firm believer that Gay's and Lesbians were born that way. Why would someone chose to be so different? I am not gay, but some of my best friends are. They would give anything to be like other people and be normal. They did not chose to be this way I can assure you. What they do with each other in a sexual manner can be concieved differently. I personally don't have a problem with it. It is their choice and if that is what makes them both happy and they do not drag other people into it, then I see no problem with it. Other people cannot even fathom any justification in two men together and those are the people most commonly known as homophobic in our society. <br>  Gay people might be frowned upon, but so are people who are racist and judge people on the conditions that they were born with. <br>  And tell me this, If God is errorless, how come there are Gays?<br>  I think that God placed homosexuals on earth to teach us acceptance and equality. Noone is getting the point though.<br>  <br>  Do you honestly think that a homosexual with a choice would CHOSE to be so different? Do you think that my 13 year old nephew would have cried every night and wrote a 12 page suicide letter if he coulod have just CHANGED his sexuality?<br>  <br>  Let me ask you this, can you CHANGE your sexuality? Right now. Try it. Can you CHOSE to be gay right now? I didn't think so. And why not? Because you were born that way.<br>  <br>  Do you think that God put homosexuals on this earth so that you all could have someone to abuse?<br>  <br>  NO!|`|d94f26490bb51c2bf9aff6bc5200f334aa	In the USA, we've made enormous strides in changing cultural attitudes towards gays. This is a recent phenomenon. <br>  <br>  After awhile, nobody cares. I guess that's acceptance.
dPYotwUxaa	Your analogy is flawed, people eat cake. There is no inner turmoil or fighting within cake, other cakes don't send in currants to oppress other currants and to look for cherries which aren't there.|`|Te7OkH2faa	Not so much a slice as the icing , leaving the sponge that no one really cares for ,the center has already being well eroded|`|DiPc84wQaa	Cake ? where ? show me.|`|DHCwLBuwaa	Mmmmm... cake.|`|PR28wVHzaa	"If Iraq is a cake" it is under-baked. You try to slice it, but it sticks to th knife and comes up un even. You'll eventually get to eat some, but you'll make a hell of a mess out of it first.|`|UuGOHHG5aa	No you just ruined it  so you can sell your own cake  :(|`|NEkssyeAaa	I think America ate the Cherry and UK ate the icing and France was left with the sponge|`|FFqWeIX7aa	Yes, America does...<br>  <br>  =)|`|psMZrXa7aa	So how many churches have we built over there?|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	No - we have left it in the oven too long and it is burnt to a crisp.

AA12006309	Some people just don't want reassignment surgery, for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  Perhaps they don't feel the surgical risk is worth it, or the results aren't up to level that they're comfortable with. Maybe they're just comfortable with what they have, despite their gender identity.  It's an individual choice whether or not to go through with surgery.  For each person you ask, you'll likely receive a completely different answer.<br>  <br>  Another term for this that you might search is is another term for this "Gender Identity Disorder, Adolescent or Adult onset, Non-Transsexual".|`|vDG0iA8laa	It's a tough call really...  If it became "free" you'd have semi-skilled "doctors / surgeons" performing these operations, and before you know it, there'd be a "rash" of bad situations..<br>  Once something becomes "free" we have to be very leary..!! And then again, I'm sure many of the transgendered "community" although "wanting" to have srs, are somewhat shy of big time surgery such as this..<br>  Breast implants, they can handle, but once you get into the <br>  "unknown areas", it's a different story<br>  From the ones that I know and have known, who have had srs, not all of them are entirely happy with the end results, and are having a very difficult time adapting to the world of "femme"..<br>  I know for myself, as a crossdresser / transvestite and "then some" that I'd like a "couple of things ADDED" but not really interested in "surrendering anything"<br>  Rachelle In High Heels|`|VRsu7c3Paa	If it was offered free by a reputable doctor then yes.<br>  <br>  However since I'm FtM and I know that the bottom surgeries suck I would not.<br>  <br>  Free top surgery I would with out a doubt if it was free and by a reputable doctor.|`|AA12074512	your a transsexual  would you..|`|W11nQzVPaa	I can fully comprehend how a transman might say that due to the obvious! The FtM surgical procedures are still at best lackluster. For them I understand it. However, for a MtF that is a very distinctly different story. The results we have available are many times more successful at both function as well as ascetics. I mean no disrespect to transmen here. Any transwoman who is a real transwoman and did not have a medical reason not to have surgery would gladly have it done. That is why my partner and I are spending virtually all of out monies shortly for her surgery. Because it is Necessary for survival! There is no way for her to be normal and whole otherwise, I say this for myself also as I am next on the list for SRS! There are no true transsexual women who would say no! It is simply not possible! <br>  Sharon|`|nsZuZ1O9aa	I would take it.|`|UbvglIS6aa	Most Transsexuals would, but some FTMs wouldn't because the FTM surgery is not as good as it needs to be.|`|xuuaMTmtaa	It depends. <br>  <br>  If you were offering me free chest reconstruction? Absolutely.  Give me that in a heartbeat!  If you were offering me genital reassignment?  No.  <br>  <br>  At this point the results aren't as asthetically pleasing as I'd like, the surgey is too invasive and painful, and the functionality of the results are less then I'd like to see. <br>  <br>  If the surgery were to improve?  Probably then I'd consider it.  At this point though? No. But thanks for offering.
Abl3Zj09aa	As an African American, I would hope that the cop is not using unnecessary force and that if he is, the cop be charged with assault. I would also be upset over the obvious black on black crime, but each person is different.|`|5Duv63Udaa	lets determine what makes an African American.....was it a person born in Africa then became a American through naturalization? <br>  <br>  like a white guy born in Johannesburg south Africa that moved here then be came an American? That is a African American.  <br>  <br>  Someone born in America regardless of the race is AMERICAN, someone who beats on someone cause of their color is an idiot.<br>  <br>  And someone  like Al Sharpton who likes to pull the race card, holding certain people back from true nondiscrimination is a hate monger....|`|LOfZNNdfaa	They care when white cops brutalize someone because it could possibly be racist.

But I agree, white on black crime is much more promoted than black on black or black on white crime.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	nothing.  they constantly talk about the slavery issue which is so old and out dated that no body who was a part of it is still alive, but don't really seem to care that it still goes on in africa...|`|kOoCya9Oaa	Unfortunately it happens all the time.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	I'm sure it happens often . . .|`|80pzIwitaa	Join in the fun.|`|5PKrR25Qaa	I would help my brother. and report the cop

P8CBDLiKaa	Unlikely, but plausible and worthy of consideration and open discussion, instead of the outright sneering you're getting from the hidebound dogmatists who can't consider anything outside of their own narrow world view.<br>  <br>  What your theory does show is that you are capable of independent thought, that you have an inquisitive mind, and that you seek new and innovative answers to age-old questions.<br>  <br>  Keep thinking the way you do and you may cure cancer or discover faster-than-light travel someday.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that God gave us not only free will, but an inquisitive nature and a drive to seek truth and knowledge.  I'd say you are working His will better than many who are answering your question.  Keep it up.|`|CB15kchkaa	Jesus walked on water to his disciples in the boat. If he was walking on ice, what were they rowing in?|`|U311MeRNaa	my answer is not intended to offend but.....<br>  Christ was born on a warm summers eve (according to the bible), we celebrate his birthday on september 25h, quite close to the druid celebration of the winter solstice, this is an amazing coincidence (also the feast of saint nicholas)<br>  Mary had a virgin birth, but we have proved this is possible with ivf treatment, is this likely in christs age? no... but it is more likely he was not a virgin birth and that mary lied to her husband (someone prove me wrong before i get a thumbs down).<br>  i could go on for a long time but basically a whole lot of the bible can be explained in such a way to make it seem like complete fiction nowadays. sorry for all you believers out there but there are too many discrepancies out there in your great book.<br>  <br>  EDIT: for the people who discredit science, science does not have all the answers, but uses facts to find them, religion thinks they have all the answers and uses books to seek then|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I think your theory is dependent on the frequent and erroneous assumption that Christians are idiots.   Surely you can not really think that frozen water was discovered only 2000 years ago.  <br>  <br>  Where or how would Jesus study medicine that would be a complete secret (i.e. nobody knew he was really just a physician)?<br>  <br>  Lots of eyewitnesses testified as to the miraculous nature of many things that Jesus did.  They suffered and even were executed for sticking to their stories.  This seems very unlikely based on your supposition that they just "made up" stories of miracles.  People with nothing to gain except eternal salvation are very unlikely to make up silly stories and die for them.  The stories were not silly, though,  and that's why people were wiling to die to stick to the Truth of the Christian story. <br>  <br>  It is also noteworthy that the Gospel writer, Luke, was himself a physician.  It seems that if Jesus was a mere physician performing reasonable medical procedures that Luke the physician would have figured that out from the available evidence.<br>  <br>  I think your proposition is about as plausible as the various hypotheses that Jesus was invented by a fiction writer in the middle ages.   Those hypotheses are astonishingly lacking in support, and so is your.  Your theory is not in reasonable terms "plausible'.<br>  <br>  I'm Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.|`|HxlRHy3Daa	ay well a theory is lol a theory it doesnt have to be true but until its proved false by other means then its plausiable and saying no in the bible it says such and such isnt hard proof that you are wrong.<br>  its an interesting theory i never thought of it that way mine were that jesus had some form of dual personality. or maybe the <br>  ancient astronaut theory|`|coYARP3aaa	If we are all gods childeren, what makes Jesus so special? Sorry f that offends you but I found that really funny.<br>  <br>  Could be possible, but I doubt he could change bread into fish using science. I belive the bible, but only the New Testement. The Old Testement sounds so farfetched.|`|aZvWDxqvaa	Un-plausible and it would be a stretch to say other wise. Reason why?<br>  <br>  Prophecies pertaining to His birth, life, death and Resurrection; You would have to deal with these issues before this theory could be possible.|`|YLW7cEjkaa	If the lake was covered in ice, they wouldn't have beens sailing across it in a boat. Kind of a weak theory, there's nothing that even indicates science.|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	No. Just no.|`|db4b4aa8deeae52ad9947eec755b5f73aa	no, not really. many of jesus' " miracles" would be hard to replicate even with today's science.<br>  <br>  For example, i don't think it is likely you can put a man in a coffin for 2 days, and find him alive.<br>  <br>  So in that sense, I don't see how those jesus "raised from the dead" could have stayed in the tombs for DAYS before jesus got to them.<br>  <br>  <br>  your theory works for some miracles, but not others.<br>  <br>  Besides, if Jesus was really a scientist, someone would have found his notes by now.<br>  <br>  Or  at least; we would have "tons of medical firsts" originating in the middle east.<br>  <br>  <br>  But we haven't heard of neither.<br>  <br>  No one has found any notes to suggest jesus was a scientist; <br>  and the middle east is not particularly famous for medical advances.|`|jjDZJmfpaa	Racist? Did you add race in your theory? I missed that.<br>  <br>  Is your theory plausible? No.<br>  <br>  There is a joke in Christian circles that I find apropos here<br>  A scientist was having a conversation with God. He marveled at the things he could do and said to God that he could do everything himself and wouldn't need Him for anything. God asked, "you can turn water into wine?" The scientist answered, "yes, I can." God asked, "you can make man from a handful of dirt?" The scientist stated, "yes, I can." There was a pause for a moment and the scientist was rather pleased with himself having the discovery that he is as great as the Almighty. So God said to him, I would like to see you create man from that handful of dirt. So the scientist bent down to grasp a handful of dirt and God interrupted him, "ah-ah, make your own dirt."<br>  <br>  Scientists make mistakes all of the time. God never made one.|`|vPeNKLK7aa	There are very many theories that could explain the whole Jesus story much better than that which we are told.  I noticed in a Stephen Fry book I was reading recently, that the Magi story is in the process of being changed: not 3 wise men anymore, now possibly twenty-thousand wise people.  The reason for this is clearly explained in the Zeitgeist movie (you can find it on this net thing).  The whole bible story is very clearly mapped out in the stars, so, change it before too many people discover that the whole story could have been made up to help people learn astral characteristics.|`|Gnbk8mrkaa	No, it is frivolous.<br>  <br>  And, moreover, the story is completely unoriginal. There were many stories like it before yet many humans find it to be true or, at the very least, plausible.<br>  <br>  In order for one to believe an ancient man—who knew MUCH LESS about the world around us than humans do as of now—is the one and only way to what many people arrogantly declare as salvation, one must be putting themselves through a great mental strain and suspending critical thinking.|`|eSfCTgHAaa	It is easy to show ancient people had as much natural intelligence or even more than we are today.

Well I use to have it, and it was awesome keeping it cause' you know you can't always say everything to someone. So it was nice, writing anything that came to mind. So yeah, I had one a few years ago. But I stopped because, well lets just say two of my family members were reading it the whole time and I had no clue. It was totally unexpected and they were the most mature people in my family. I was really hurt and then I just stopped. And I lost all trust in those people.

Also, he does not ascribe faults to himself; he defends and exonerates himself like a lawyer.

dQmFoRRiaa	I'm not sure exactly what you are driving at, but I will go on record as saying that I abhor racism.  It amounts, at best, to a distortion of fact; as one of your earlier respondents has said, the differences among individuals is more pronounced than that between races, putting the lie to the stereotypes that so confound the racists' thinking.  At worst, racism serves as an unofficial sanction for the abridgement of civil liberties and as a justification for blind hatred and oppression.  I'm sorry you have to encounter this at school, but it will, I suspect, be with us always...|`|a0b1f8c0a89f6e9a6fb1048bcf570db3aa	Whah? Hmmm. The way you asked this is a little confusing. My opinion about racism is that it is often eliminated if people do develop relationships with one another. It takes pure hatred and fear to be racist. Racism is often a wall that makes people feel falsely superior to others which makes small people feel special. Sorry that you have to deal with racists. Don't let the epidemic personally effect you. Stay positive. Know that every place is not that way.|`|19b02a50f67872d6956b72cff56771e0aa	I don't really get your question but you perhaps mean what is the difference?  We are 1 human race  but that race is under divide in levels  levels that do not mean that one is stupid or whatever  just that there are differences between one race and another. its like with animals  we are not better or worse just different, that means that one race would .likely survive better or do well better than the other, simple and true  it also depends of where and when.. a polar bear wont survive in tropical africa / neither does a lion in the arctics.. the same is for humans   they try though and adapt  but not completely   i took the weather as an example  but you can take anything  such as politics or religion..  see what i mean?|`|GaKVvupTaa	Racism is ignorance at its finest<br>  <br>  Did you know the term "race" is really worth nothing, there's one race and thats human.<br>  <br>  The differences percieved as "race" make up only .02% of our DNA.|`|3zxVzPBxaa	i know... not think, i know that there are more differences between individuals than between races.<br>  <br>  I'm not really sure what you are trying to ask here.. add more detail.|`|OM71kA5Faa	You need to be more specific.

OzPheiN1aa	Wow the unfairness is the school, the state and the parents allowing children to be indoctrinated into  this nonsense at aged 8, leave the kids alone and allow them to decide at 18 after they have life experience and an education|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Why do you care what they do? It's their child. I'm pretty sure they just want their child to experience the same thing all the other children are experiencing. You can visit different places of worship, join in with their activities, and not be a member of that particular faith. I used to do it quite a lot when I was young. It's a good way to learn about things. I don't think it's making a mockery of anything. Children are innocent. <br>  At that time in life they just want to be like all their friends. :-)|`|VUfT35UQaa	The parents are either thinking that they don't want their child to feel excluded, or they aren't thinking at all and just want a photo opportunity. They probably do not realize that they are hoodwinking her into a religion that a lot of people take seriously. They should make sure that she wants to be catholic and have her baptized before the communion if she wants to be part of the faith. They are making this religious tradition into a ceremony with no religious bearing, and that is both wrong and offensive.<br>  <br>  By saying you do not even have to be Christian to take part in the ceremony is making other children feel as if this is not the special occasion and right of passage that it should be, and is just a dress up party which does not have to be a religious issue.<br>  <br>  I was not religious at the time, but when I was 8 I went to my friends communion where it was an issue of religion, not of doing it for the sake of it.<br>  <br>  Why should she take part when it won;t mean anything to her and just decrease the meaning for others?<br>  <br>  "I feel that its making a mockery of the church, and that you cant just 'pretend' to be part of a certain faith just for the sake of a day. I have no problem with the child being present at the mass, but i don't think that she should be going through the motions just for the sake of fitting in." - you are totally right, the priest can't however disallow her as it could be seen as discrimination.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Sounds like they are offering her a chance to not be left out.  Her level of understanding must be minimal.

If that is what they plan to do, you need to talk to your priest right away.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Oh, I see. Well, at least the child doesn't plan on consuming the Eucharist. But in any way, I believe that going through the physical ups, downs, lefts, and rights, just for the sake of doing so is not morally correct. You should still talk with your priest about this.

When I think of "emo", I think of a very arrogant, self absorbed, teenager who believes they know better than people who have been walking this earth longer than they have been alive. Feel that they deserve a pat on the back every time they do a good deed, and so on.  I myself am 16, so I guess I could say I see A LOT of this high school branding name game (Jocks, Emos, etc.) I like to get along with anyone who welcomes me, The branding thing is 1950's crap, it's 2009. Most kids that claim they are "emo" that I know of, have more money than my family, live in a big house, and get spoiled beyond belief, so no clue where that whole "I Hate my life!" thing came from, maybe they want negative attention just for the simple fact that it's some kind of attention?

The effects on the brain include distortion of the senses, confused judgment, and decreased motor skills. Operating machinery and motor vehicles becomes dangerous. Effects on the heart include rapid heart rate and high blood pressure. Respiratory problems include pharyngitis, laryngitis, and bronchitis. Marijuana has been associated with lung, head, and neck cancers. It reduces the T-cells in the immune system that are needed to fight off infections. In pre-teens, marijuana use can retard physical growth and slow down development. High dose marijuana use can cause decreased fertility, breast enlargement in males, and breast milk production.|`|BnTYoxUIaa	Marijuana is not bad or good.

Estradiol, and testosterone, which is catalysed by the enzyme 5α-reductase into dihydrotestosterone, act upon androgen receptors in the brain to masculinize it. If there are few androgen receptors (people with Androgen insensitivity syndrome) or too much androgen (females with Congenital adrenal hyperplasia) there can be physical and psychological effects. It has been suggested that both male and female homosexuality are results of variation in this process. In these studies lesbianism is typically linked with a higher amount of masculinization than is found in heterosexual females, though when dealing with male homosexuality there are results supporting both higher and lower degrees of masculinization than heterosexual males|`|61c337fa18a8733fdf55c06c6acb891faa	It's like asking, can someone choose to stop loving someone.

However, if u loved that person even more than u valued ure life, that u culdnt imagine a life without that person, then no, u wuldnt be able to stop loving.

If you are attracted to a certain kind of person (guy or girl), you can't change it. It is a part of who you are. Nobody talks about straight people having to decide who they are attracted to, and it should be the same for people who are gay and lesbian. Once you accept who you are and who you are attracted to, you are able to search and find the love of your life.|`|AA11198284	Its in you.  Its not changable.  If you ask any gay person.  They would tell you they had these feelings since childhood.  No one can just turn gay.  You are born with it.

Our purpose was to understand our purpose. To help, some created a God to explain those things they could never hope to understand. And while they still don't KNOW, it helps them sleep at night while allowing them to live with the illusion of certitude.<br>  <br>  Many are happy in their ignorance and distrustful of anyone with an original idea who challenges their composure by forcing them to experience an original thought.

"Dad, pues, al César lo que es del César y a Dios lo que es de Dios" (Mt. 20, 21 y par.). <br>  Ambos poderes son originarios e inderivables el uno del otro, y correspondientes al orden natural y sobrenatural. Es doctrina de la Iglesia esta dualidad de poderes con su ámbito propio: las doctrinas monistas son contrarias a la doctrina católica. <br>  <br>  15.1.2 Interdependencia y colaboración <br>  Las relaciones entre la Iglesia y el Estado han de ser de unión y colaboración, actuando cada uno en su propio orden, y a la vez de mutuo reconocimiento, particularmente en las materias mixtas (porque afectan a los fines de ambas), como son la educación, el matrimonio, etc. <br>  <br>  El Estado, cumpliendo con su fin propio, debe ayudar a la Iglesia y colaborar con ella, disponiendo los asuntos temporales con libertad de modo que puedan ser fácilmente ordenados al fin sobrenatural. El Estado tiene no sólo un fin material sino también ético: debe custodiar la ley natural. De esta manera, coopera, en su orden, a la salvación de las almas. <br>  <br>  La Iglesia no persigue fines temporales puesto que su fin es más alto, y a este fin se ordena todo lo temporal. La Iglesia, cumpliendo su fin sobrenatural, presta un gran servicio a la sociedad civil en lo que se refiere al bien temporal, pues impulsa y facilita a los ciudadanos la práctica de todas las virtudes, con lo cual se asegura el respeto a las leyes, el orden, la paz, la justicia, etc. <br>  <br>  15.1.3 Potestad de la Iglesia en asuntos temporales <br>  <br>  La Iglesia goza de una potestad indirecta en el orden temporal, en cuanto que es de su competencia declarar la ley natural y protegerla, puesto que el fin natural se ordena al sobrenatural. <br>  <br>  Esta potestad la ejerce mediante declaraciones, prohibiciones, sanciones en cuanto a realidades o situaciones que se opongan a la moral natural: por ejemplo a través de la prohibición de votar en favor de partidos políticos que se oponen a la ley natural. <br>  <br>  "La comunidad política v la Iglesia son independientes y autónomas, cada una en su Propio terreno. Ambas, sin embargo, aunque por diverso título, están al servicio de la vocación personal y social del hombre. Este servicio lo realizarán con tanta mayor eficiencia, para bien de todos, cuanto más sana y mejor sea la cooperación entre ellas, habida cuenta de las circunstancias de lugar y tiempo. El hombre, en efecto, no se limita al solo horizonte temporal, sino que, sujeto de la historia humana, mantiene íntegramente su vocación eterna. ( ... ) Es de justicia que pueda la Iglesia en todo momento y en todas partes predicar la fe con auténtica libertad, ense?ar su doctrina social, ejercer su misión entre los hombres sin traba alguna y dar su juicio moral, incluso sobre materias referentes al orden político, cuando lo exijan los derechos fundamentales de la persona o la salvación de las almas, utilizando todos y sólo aquellos medios que sean conformes al Evangelio y al bien de todos según la diversidad de tiempos y situaciones" (Conc. Vaticano II, Const. Gaudiumet Spes, n. 76).<br>  Por tanto, la Iglesia tiene el derecho y el deber de intervenir, incluso de modo autoritario -dando criterios de acción a los católicos-, en cuestiones de orden temporal, cuando lo amerita una causa justa y grave, esto es, cuando estén en grave peligro los derechos de Dios o de la Iglesia, y la salvación de las almas. <br>  <br>  15.2 DIVERSOS MODOS DE REGULAR LAS RELACIONES JURIDICAS ENTRE LA IGLESIA Y EL ESTADO <br>  <br>  15.2.1 Los Concordatos <br>  <br>  a) Teniendo en cuenta los criterios centrales que se acaban de exponer, la forma práctica de proceder puede variar según los tiempos y circunstancias: no será la misma en aquellos paises donde hay mayoría católica, que donde son una minoría. <br>  <br>  b) La Iglesia, en algunos casos, tolera situaciones menos justas atendiendo a la situación del país o del gobierno. Cuando se presentan ciertas anormalidades, es obligación de los católicos conseguir que cesen esas circunstancias, mediante el ejercicio de sus deberes y derechos de ciudadanos. <br>  <br>  c) Actualmente, las relaciones entre la Iglesia y el Estado, suelen regularse mediante pactos que se llaman Concordatos. <br>  <br>  15.3 LEGISLACION CIVIL EN ALGUNOS PAISES <br>  <br>  a) En algunos países no existen relaciones oficiales entre la Iglesia y el Estado. <br>  <br>  b) La legislación en algunos países no reconoce ni otorga ninguna personalidad jurídica a instituciones religiosas, ni a sus ministros. Incluso en naciones donde el gobierno se declara neutro en este terreno, resulta, por su orientación liberal y materialista, injusto y anitirreligioso. <br>  <br>  Por desgracia, en muchos lugares la Iglesia no goza de la plena libertad y respeto que requiere para cumplir con su misión; se ve forzada a actuar mediante "concesiones". <br>  <br>  "La libertad o inmunidad de coacción en materia religiosa que compete a las personas individualmente consideradas, debe serles reconocida también cuando actúan en común. Porque las sociedades religiosas son exigidas por la naturaleza social del hombre y de la misma religión". <br>  Por consiguiente, a estas sociedades, con tal que no se violen las justas exigencias del orden público, debe reconocérseles el derecho de inmunidad para regirse por sus propias normas, para honrar a la Divinidad con culto público, para ayudar a sus miembros en el ejercicio de la vida religiosa y sostenerles mediante la doctrina, así como para promover instituciones en la que sus seguidores colaboren con el fin de ordenar la propia vida según sus principios refigiosos" (Conc. Vat. II, Decl. Dignitatis Humanae, n. 4). <br>  <br>  <br>  15.4 CUESTIONES MIXTAS; MATRIMONIO Y EDUCACION <br>  15.4.1 Matrimonio entre bautizados <br>  <br>  El régimen del matrimonio entre bautizados, compete directamente a la Iglesia por ser un sacramento además de contrato. Y es también competencia del Estado en cuanto a sus efectos civiles, por tratarse de la familia que es la primera célula de la sociedad. <br>  <br>  El poder civil tiene la obligación por derecho natural, de reconocer la validez del matrimonio canónico entre los bautizados, dándoles plenos efectos civiles. Esta obligación afecta a todos los Estados, por ser de derecho natural, con independencia de que exista o no en el país una mayoría católica. <br>  <br>  "... todos los que influyen en las comunidades y grupos sociales deben contribuir eficazmente al progreso del matrimonio y de la familia. El poder civil ha de considerar obligación suya sagrada reconocer la verdadera naturaleza del matrimonio y de la familia, protegerla y ayudarla, asegurar la moralidad pública y favorecer la prosperidad doméstica. Hay que salvaguardar el derecho de los padres a procrear y educar en el seno de la familia a sus hijos. Se debe proteger con la legislación adecuada y diversas instituciones, y ayudar de forma suficiente a aquéllos que desgraciadamente carecen del bien de una familia propia" (Conc. Vat. II, Const. Gaudiun et Spes, n. 52).<br>  Normalmente, los concordatos regulan con detalle esta cuestión. En general, la Iglesia exige el reconocimiento por parte del Estado de todos los efectos del matrimonio y de su función de única intérprete de la ley natural, dejando en manos del Estado la regulación de los efectos meramente civiles: por ejemplo la cuantía de la dote legitima, <br>  No obstante, en virtud de circunstancias especiales, a veces la Iglesia "tolera" pero no aprueba, en los concordatos, que algunos de sus derechos en esta materia no sea reconocido por la ley civil, sin perjuicio de la vigencia inmediata de la Ley divina natural y positiva.<br>  15.4.2 Educación <br>  El derecho y el deber de educar a los hijos corresponde primariamente a los padres, bajo la potestad de la Iglesia y del Estado en lo que se refiere a sus fines respectivos. La escuela es una institución subsidiaria y complementaria de la familia, a quien compete el derecho primario de promoverlas, regirlas, etc. <br>  <br>  La competencia que tienen sobre la escuela el Estado y la Iglesia, se determina por la competencia que ambos tienen sobre el ejercicio del derecho y del deber de los padres a educar a sus hijos. <br>  <br>  Compete a la Iglesia una potestad directa sobre la ense?anza, en todo lo que haga relación a la fe y a las costumbres: no sólo sobre el modo de ense?ar la religión, sino sobre la orientación cristiana de cualquier ense?anza que se imparte a los fieles (católicos), al menos, sobre la no contrariedad de toda ense?anza en general, con la verdad y ley naturales. Además, por propia iniciativa, puede promover centros de ense?anza privada; y debe velar porque el Estado cumpla con sus deberes de ley natural respecto a ella misma y a los padres. <br>  <br>  Al Estado le compete dictar las normas relativas a la ense?anza "(exigidas" por el bien común temporal de la sociedad. Este bien común exige, precisamente, ante todo la tutela del derecho de los padres y, además, una función subsidiaria para completar lo que no puedan los padres: en primer lugar -subvencionando la ense?anza privada, y si fuera necesario, supliéndola donde no llegue. <br>  <br>  15.5 LA IGLESIA Y LAS CUESTIONES TEMPORALES <br>  <br>  15.5.1 Defensa de la ley natural <br>  <br>  La parte más importante del bien común temporal, es de carácter o alcance espiritual, ya que implica la defensa de todos aquellos aspectos de orden social que más directamente aseguran que los individuos puedan vivir conforme a su dignidad humana, y dirigirse al mismo tiempo a su fin último que es Dios. Esto es: la defensa de la ley natural, de la verdad, de la honestidad, de las costumbres, de los derechos de Dios en la sociedad, del matrimonio, de la recta educación, etc. <br>  <br>  "El bien común de la sociedad, que es la suma de aquellas condiciones de la vida social mediante las cuales los hombres pueden conseguir con mayor plenitud y facilidad su propia perfección, consiste sobre todo en el respeto de los deberes y derechos de la persona humana. <br>  ( ... ) Pertenece esencialmente a la obligación de todo poder civil promover y proteger los derechos inviolables del hombre" (Conc. Vat. II, Decl. Dignitatis Humanae, n. 6) <br>  <br>  15.5.2 Derecho y deber de defender estos principios <br>  La Iglesia tiene además del derecho, el grave deber de defender siempre estos principios, mostrándolos con toda su fuerza y condenando los errores que los contradigan, como el más grande da?o para el bien común. Esto afecta tanto a los fieles como a la jerarquía, pero especialmente a la Autoridad eclesiástica. <br>  <br>  "En cuanto ata?e a las obras e instituciones de orden temporal, el oficio de la jerarquía eclesiástica es ense?ar e interpretar auténticamente los principios morales que hay que seguir en los asuntos temporales, a discernir sobre la conformidad de tales obras e instituciones con los principios morales, y sobre cuanto se requiere para salvaguardar y promover los bienes del orden sobrenatural" (Conc. Vat. II, Decl. Apostolicam Actuositaten, n. 24).<br>  15.5.3La Iglesia puede emitir juicios sobre situaciones concretas <br>  En uso de este derecho, la Iglesia puede, en caso necesario (que no será normal), emitir juicios sobre situaciones concretas, denunciándolas como repugnantes directamente a tales principios. <br>  <br>  Este tipo de declaraciones por parte de la Autoridad eclesiástica, ha sido más frecuentemente en este último siglo, sobre todo en relación a las exigencias de la ley natural en cuestiones como el trabajo, la distribución de la riqueza, la educación, las obligaciones sociales, etc., en una serie de Documentos cuyo contenido suele denominarse Ense?anza Social de la Iglesia. <br>  <br>  "La Iglesia ( ... ) no puede en modo alguno renunciar al cometido, a ella confiado por Dios, de interponer su autoridad, no ciertamente en materias teóricas, para las cuales no cuenta con los medios adecuados ni es su cometido, sino en todas aquellas que se refieran a la moral. En lo que ata?e a estas cosas, el depósito de la verdad, a Nos confiada por Dios, y el gravísimo deber de divulgar, de interpretar y aun de urgir oportuna e inoportunamente toda la ley moral, somete y sujeta a nuestro supremo juicio tanto el orden de las cosas sociales cuanto el de las mismas cosas económicas" (Pío XI, Enc. Quadragessimo Anno, n. 41). <br>  <br>  15.6 DERECHOS Y DEBERES DE LOS CATOLICOS EN CUANTO A LA POLITICA <br>  15.6.1Los católicos como ciudadanos <br>  <br>  Los católicos como ciudadanos tienen los mismos deberes y derechos que los demás ciudadanos, con igual libertad y responsabilidad ante el Estado. <br>  <br>  15.6.2 El orden de la ley natural <br>  <br>  El católico tiene, como todo ciudadano, el derecho y el deber de exigir que el Estado respete el orden de la ley natural; y en concreto: su derecho sobre la educación de los hijos, una justa regulación del matrimonio, y la potestad dada por Dios a su Iglesia. Especialmente para los católicos se trata de un deber grave. <br>  <br>  Especialmente en estos puntos, los católicos han de saber luchar bien. Es muy importante que quienes tienen condiciones y posibilidades, participen activamente en la política; pero todos han de intervenir de un modo u otro en la consecución del bien común y el recto orden de la vida social. <br>  <br>  "La vocación propia de los laicos consiste en buscar el reino de Dios tratando y ordenando, según el querer de Dios, las cosas temporales" (Conc. Vat. II, Decl. Apostolicam Actuositaten, n. 7). <br>  "Es preciso que los laicos acepten como obligación propia el instaurar el orden temporal v el actuar directamente y de forma concreta en dicho orden, dirigidos por la luz del Evangelio y la mente de la Iglesia, y movidos por la caridad cristiana; el cooperar como ciudadanos con los demás, según su competencia y bajo su propia responsabilidad,- y el buscar en todas partes y en todo la justicia del Reino de Dios. Hay que instaurar el orden temporal de tal forma que, salvando íntegramente todas las leyes, se ajuste a los principios superiores de la vida cristiana y se mantenga adaptado a las variadas circunstancias de lugar, tiempo y nación" Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, Amigos de Dios, ERSA 1982, n. 58). <br>  <br>  15.6.3 Libertad de los católicos <br>  Además de la obligación de cumplir en todo la ley de Dios, y de defender especialmente estos principios de la Ley natural que obligan a todos los hombres por ser de Ley natural, los católicos no tienen otra obligación propia por ser católicos. Por esto, actúan con libertad y responsabilidad en materia política. <br>  <br>  La jerarquía no puede inmiscuirse en su modo concreto de actuar, si respetan la ley de Dios, dentro de las múltiples opciones humanas legítimamente opinables. Este es el fundamento de que el Estado tampoco pueda ponerles ninguna traba o condición a los católicos, por el mismo hecho de serlo, pues sería injusto. <br>  <br>  15.6.4 Verdadera obligación cristiana <br>  <br>  Por desgracia, "es frecuente, aun entre católicos que parecen responsables y piadosos, el error de pensar que sólo están obligados a cumplir sus deberes familiares y religiosos, y apenas quieren oír hablar de deberes cívicos. No se trata de egoísmo: es sencillamente falta de formación, porque nadie les ha dicho nunca claramente que la virtud de la piedad -aparte de la virtud cardinal de la justicia-, y el sentido de la solidaridad cristiana se concretan también en este estar presentes, en este conocer y contribuir a resolver los problemas que interesan a toda la comunidad" (Escrivá de Balaguer, J., citado por Illanes, J.L., en La santificación del trabajo, (5a. ed., Madrid 1974), p. 75.) <br>  <br>  "No pueden, por consiguiente, los fieles descuidar el cumplimiento de sus deberes "sociales" (...) semejante ignorancia o abstencionismo significaría una grave omisión: privar a la sociedad de las aportaciones constructivas que las praxis de dicha doctrina acarrea para el bien común" (Pero-Sanz, J.M, Creyentes en la Sociedad (Madrid 1981) p. 62). <br>  <br>  Como es lógico, en estas páginas no cabe apuntar sumariamente -ni es posible todo el contenido de las "obligaciones sociales" del cristiano. Basta a modo de ejemplo se?alar omisiones -a veces graves en este terreno: <br>  <br>  - Transigencia cómplice con irregularidades de tipo institucional; <br>  <br>  - abstencionismo en elecciones <br>  <br>  - acomodación a un sistema injusto de comisiones comerciales <br>  <br>  - incumplimiento de obligaciones con los superiores o inferiores <br>  <br>  - maltrato o desprecio a los necesitados <br>  <br>  - negar el apoyo que pueda darse a instituciones asistenciales, culturales, etc. <br>  <br>  - apegamiento a los bienes de la tierra <br>  <br>  - gastos inútiles o superfluos, por lujo, capricho, vanidad, etc. <br>  <br>  - aplicación de la justicia a secas, sin que esté empapada de caridad <br>  <br>  - limitarse a un poco de beneficencia <br>  <br>  - desprecio de las obras de misericordia <br>  <br>  -trabajo mal hecho <br>  <br>  - etc. <br>  <br>  "Un hombre o una sociedad que no reaccione ante las tribulaciones o las injusticias, y que no se esfuerce por aliviarlas, no son un hombre o una sociedad a la medida del amor del Corazón de Cristo, los cristianos -conservando siempre la más amplia libertad a la hora de estudiar y de llevar a la práctica las diversas soluciones y, por tanto, con un lógico pluralismo-, han de coincidir en el idéntico afán de servir a la humanidad. De otro modo, su cristianismo no será la Palabra y la Vida de Jesús: será un disfraz, un enga?o de cara a Dios y de cara a los hombres" Josemaría Escrivá de Balaguer, Es Cristo que pasa, n. 167).
AA11059890	as you may have noticed seaworld the whole racism bit changes person to person, that alone tells me that racism has no one set meaning and just means whatever the speaker wants it to, it's also why i have no use for it what so ever, if it was the special treatment that some folks say black folks get how's that supposed to help me meet my goals? all that will lead to is more infighting and more wasted time. as i see it no matter what colour you are people will always have a rough road forward and stopping to worry about how green the grass is on the other side will do is just breed more of the same, i washed my hands of it long ago, i will continue to do what i do until one of two things happen 1) i die 2) someone stops me|`|ncdTxID9aa	When will people stop asking questions based on what people say online and not in society?  I mean how many white people in real life complain about other races and special treatment?(whatever that means).  They aren't mad about Black history month, Puerto Rican parade, Native American History month.   You and other one race defenders love trying to show how Pro Black you are and Anti White. Look at your ideology on whites, your past questions you call them cavemen, wet dogs, etc, why should you be taken seriously?<br>  <br>  <br>  Some of you have a LOT of growing up to do.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I just answered, White people aren't concerned about you.  Black history month was established by whites,  many black colleges are owned by whites, some of you kill me with the White people are evil rants.  Like I said you only speak of whites online.|`|c1fEFlc7aa	I understand your point, but in a way its not really special treatment.  Because minorities have so much going against them (discrimination in the education system, finding employment, etc), giving them "special treatment" is a way of letting them catch up to the whites and have the same opportunities as everyone else.  <br>  For example, afrocentric schools give black students a fair shot and more opportunities in life than they otherwise wouldnt have, so i dunno...i dont really think you would call it "special treatment" and I dont see how ppl could be upset about it...|`|npTZTzWRaa	I just want to comment on an HBO special I recently saw where they interviewed white people in the south (Mississipi and Texas) and these people were saying racial slurs left and right talking about they would have never voted for a black man<br>  <br>  I believe that roughly 50-60%of Mccain supporters were racist or atleast prejudiced or biased<br>  <br>  When it comes to the south (and other areas) this country has not actually made so much progress<br>  <br>  They even had a couple older white guys literally crying TEARS because Obama came this far and they were saying how this country used to be great (when there was more racism) and how they're terrified of a black man being in office|`|OUBuIKDMaa	Sometimes, but not always. Special treatment is only racism when it has to do exclusively with race (ie hiring someone just because they're a minority, denying employment because they're not, etc.)

I LOVE Lil' Wayne and I wouldn't be surprised if he was bi-sexual only because of the whole kissing on the lips thing with Baby. However, I haven't heard anything about him having sexual relations with any males, only females.|`|ph9ZE1veaa	no. have you actually heard one of his songs? they dont sound gay AT ALL. and he says "no homo" at the beginning of a lot of them.|`|dqszKQfBaa	I seriously doubt it. And he doesn't seem like the type of guy that would come out in high school if he was gay. I think it's just another gay humor.|`|cbY6NoHSaa	Then that is one ugly gay man! haha|`|jIS8JBiJaa	lil wayne is straight i here that alot but then he has 3 kids and i dont think he was married though plus have you heared lolipop?|`|tOd9OuNiaa	ew, I hate lil' wayne. He's not worthy enough to be gay.
4MLtp9g1aa	Sounds like you might just like north east and central Kansas. Plenty of demand for nurses. Pretty country with timber, fields,lakes and ponds, crop ground, etc. Close enough to the cities for the culture scene. Good place to live and enjoy life. Small towns or cities. Most people are friendly and just plain old folk. Our neighbors just moved here(small town, pop.2500) from San Antonio last summer, and they love it. Give it a look, and good luck to you.|`|vYeS5mYnaa	STAY OUTTA new brunswick canada! too much bleeping snow!
fBjGH4zEaa	There's nothing in the Bible that commands we follow lent, it's more a remembrance of Jesus' 40 days of temptation and a chance to reflect on his sacrifice in the run up to Easter. The important thing is that you resist temptation, it doesn't really matter which food you've chosen.<br>  <br>  Having said that I suppose if you change the food a few days in because you're finding it too hard to avoid then it's kinda defeating the point of lent at all! It's not meant to be easy! <br>  <br>  But no, it's not a sin and if you mess up then it's a chance to think about why. <br>  <br>  I gave up chocolate and ate some today; i did it without thinking because i usually eat it everyday so I just bought and ate some on autopilot. I was so annoyed when i realised what I'd done! But it's made me realise that we are tempted all the time and can give into it without even realising. So in a way I've learned something by failing and so I'm not going to beat myself up about it! I will just start again tomorrow.|`|Wt398Yueaa	They keep changing the rules. <br>  In the middle ages, people had to give up certain kinds of foods, so they must have been pretty spaced out by the time Easter came along. Back when I was Catholic, I was only expected to make a token gesture. I can't remember anyone telling me that it was compulsory.|`|x3RAaLfNaa	No idea, not Catholic, but I would love to know the reasoning behind this.
sdS6tLTPaa	What does your question about the moon have to do with atheism? All you are doing is showing how ignorant you are about both atheism and basic astronomy.<br>  <br>  Actually, perhaps it is because you are so completely ignorant that you believe in a god. After all, religion had its beginning way long ago when ignorant primitives tried to come up with explanations of what they saw in nature.<br>  <br>  In any case, the moon has gravity, but it is less than the earth's because it has less mass. It also has energy because of its orbital velocity around the earth. Also, the moon on average is no closer to the sun than is the earth. (You do understand that the earth/moon system is orbiting the sun, don't you. Or do you believe the Bible when it says that the earth doesn't move?) <br>  <br>  And you said "oh the Sun made it goes around the Earth." Are you saying that is what atheists say is the reason the moon goes around the earth? That is dumb piled upon dumb. (Also, why don't you go back to school and learn some basic grammar?)<br>  <br>  What is your question about eclipses? It's a perfectly natural thing that happens when the moon in its orbit comes between the earth and the sun. What's so impossible about that?<br>  <br>  What it all boils down to is this: Instead of reading that book of myths and superstition called the Bible, why not read some books on science and really learn something?|`|CLB32006aa	You lack knowledge about the world around you and think that there is a giant all powerful being in your image making the universe work like a puppeteer? That is truly a stone age understanding of the universe, please make use of all of the information we have acquired since then.|`|pO8OzblHaa	Hahaha. You don't make any sense. The moon goes around the Earth because of Earth's gravitational pull. The Earth goes around the sun because of the sun's gravitational pull. Neither of those are directly involved with the Big Bang Theory, they're just connected.|`|bEeozqacaa	Billions of years ago the Moon and the Earth collided and the remaining parts of the Moon put itself together and it is stuck in our gravitation pull. The moon has gravity but it is smaller so it could only attract smaller planetoids or asteroids.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	Wow - please read about gravity.<br>  <br>  Every object has mass and everything with mass has gravity.<br>  <br>  The astronauts were able to walk on the moon remember?  The gravity is less because the total mass of the moon is less than earth.|`|k5Ece8BTaa	Actually, the moon does have some gravity.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be an Atheist to enjoy or study science. Anybody can enjoy science. Those who believe in God they feel that science helps them to study God's creation.|`|5urfAbazaa	what on earth are you even talking about? Why do you even bother asking a question like this when you know it'd be a science/astronomy book? Oh I know, you just want biased answers that'd support what you think.|`|pSS1xPknaa	You should be congratulated. I didn't think it was humanly possible to cram that much stupidity in a single question.<br>  <br>  I am awe struck.|`|bb5e3162f4c207ab157801f357f83c36aa	<<<sound of brain gently frying>>><br>  <br>  Don't be silly, there is no gravity.  God holds us down to the Earth by grasping us with His Noodly Appendages.  Once we achieve His grace by True Belief, He will release us and we will float off the Earth and land on the slopes of the Beer Volcano in Heaven!  RAmen!<br>  <br>  Similarly, some of His Longer Appendages hold the Moon in its circle around the Earth.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	I can't imagine why you'd post this here, and as it reads. If you truly seek the answers you can do a couple different things. One, post in the science section. Two, start learning things for yourself by researching them here online. There are great sites that you can get the info from without the religious/non-religious game. That is, if you really want the answers from scientists with doctorate degrees. Maybe you don't want that?|`|LGBNKuxRaa	hey, do you tie your own shoelaces?|`|qbelhflAaa	I. AM. NOT. A. SCIENTIST. OR. ANYTHING. LIKE. THAT.<br>  <br>  I. LACK. BELIEF. IN. DEITIES. <br>  <br>  THAT.

They both orbit the sun about this point.|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	I hope that you are not the future of America (if you are in America).  It would be disastrous if the new generations start thinking like you.|`|TinNG7k7aa	Wow, your lack of education is showing.<br>  <br>  In fact the moon DOES have gravity. Just not as much as Earth's.<br>  <br>  But as for anything else, please make your point or stop ranting.|`|WMPbyXwcaa	OMG MY EYES!!!  if you were just stupid and wanted to know the answer that would be bad enough.  But you asked atheists to explain one of the worlds most OBVIOUS things.  and not only did they shut you down, the CHRISTIANS told you you were stupid.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	you're curious that's a really good quality, keep reading books and maybe asking questions in the science section or astronomy section and stay in school!|`|35ff9d3ad1eb64812f64b2031173d7e4aa	Backtrack, of course the moon has gravity. That's why astronauts don't go floating away. The exact same thing happens on Earth.<br>  <br>  The moon is caught in an orbit around Earth due to gravtity. The Earth is larger than the moon. The Earth is caught in the sun's orbit due to gravity. That is because the sun is larger than the Earth.<br>  <br>  So...what is the rest of your question? It's very confusing. Might I recommend a trip to the public library?<br>  <br>  And why just ask Atheists? I'm a Christian, and even I knew these things...|`|77cb033374598e8c10938763c9fe03f7aa	Gravity and the moon are a grave concern to astronomers and lunatics.<br>    We will just have to wait for your results.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	The moon DOES have gravity.  Wait, are you really that stupid????

Ignorance is NOT something to be proud about.  But, if thats all you have, I guess you can blame God for not giving you the ability to use your brain.<br>  The Moon is near the Sun? (please note capitalization - might want to consider reviewing grade school English).  Not.<br>  "Causes" ?  No, not really.  You won't understand this but here goes: Many "scientific" explanations simply use words to mask our ignorance.  You are right that using the label "gravity" to describe a force doesn't EXPLAIN the force.  Nor does all of the math, tensor calculus and differential topology we have sucessfully (and not so sucessfully) used to describe and predict the effects of this force.  Actually, description and prediction are what science does.  Its up to each one of us to absorb the facts and arrive at understanding ...or not.<br>  "Causes" is one of those words that doesn't really have a good definition. It means what we want it to in the context of the moment.<br>  Did the JFK assassination "cause" LBJ to be sworn in as president?  There is no effect (excluding the big bang which none of us understand at all) which does not have millions and trillions of predecessor events any or all of which can be claimed to be "causes".  We use the word to allow us to understand what we can and can not control in this beautiful Universe God gave us.  A "cause" is a type of categorization.<br>  But I wouldn't expect you to understand a word of this.<br>  "The Sun made it goes around the Earth."

The moon revolves around the earth because it is caught in an orbit around the earth due to our gravitational field.  Just like the earth revolves around the sun because we are in orbit around the sun because we are caught in its gravitational field.  As for eclipses, they happen when the moon comes between the earth and the sun thereby making it appear as if the moon blocks out the sun.  Since the moon is 400 times closer to the earth than the sun, and the sun is 400 times farther away but 400 times bigger, it just appears as if they are the same size relative to your position on earth.|`|fQAjPXPAaa	God!

Science and religion are not contradictory.  They teach us about completely different aspects of our lives.  Religion is for the spirit; science is for the physical body.  The Bible does not say that science is blasphemous.  Science is the study of nature and what happens in it.  You could also say we are studying the nature that God created.<br>  <br>  One of the founding fathers of the Big Bang theory was a Catholic priest.  His name was Georges Lema?tre.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	So, instead of learning any basic science (the stuff most of us learned in grade 3), you choose to show your ignorance about the most basic facts.<br>  <br>  What do atheists have to do with your lack of education?<br>  <br>  The moon is no closer to the sun than the Earth is (the moon orbits the Earth).  <br>  The moon has gravity, just like the Earth does, just like an elephant does, just like a kernel of corn does.  Gravity is directly related to the amount of mass in an object (mass simply means the amount of stuff).<br>  The more mass (the more stuff) the more gravity.<br>  Since the Earth has more mass than the moon, Earth's gravity affects the moon and keeps it in orbit around the Earth (just like the sun's gravity keeps the planets in orbit around the sun).<br>  Think of a string with a rock tied to it that you twirl around your head - the string keeps the rock from flying off, but the rock's speed as it moves around you keeps it from falling towards you.  The string is like gravity, the rock's speed is like a planet's motion around the sun (or the moon's motion around the Earth).<br>  <br>  Not sure what you mean by "species, dirt, competition, gravity, energy" - that makes absolutely no sense.<br>  <br>  During a total solar eclipse, the moon has simply moved between the Earth and the sun so that the moon's shadow falls on the surface of the Earth.  Its no different than putting up your hand to shade your eyes from the sun - they are both just shadows.<br>  <br>  No, the Big Bang theory didn't "do that too" - the Big Bang has nothing to do with the motion of the moon around the Earth or the motions of the planets around the sun.|`|L86QJXzEaa	Go read any astronomically based book.<br>  Try learning something.<br>  It would help.|`|MF9YknDYaa	Wow,really?how old are you?Let me explain,Mass causes space-time to bend and this bending is gravity.You have mass and you have gravity as well.The Moon has mass and gravity but not as much as the Sun or the Earth.Please you use a computer,a product of science and reason,learn some science,you will love it.|`|DZ9ADg7Xaa	Ask this in the science section if you want real answers, not biased ones that will only try to confirm your ignorance.|`|YkvXHsqnaa	sheesh, this is what happens when you are cramped with half knowledge,. of course moon has gravity, and of course sun and earth have gravity too....gravity is best explained in theory of relativity, we fall towards sun coz of its higher mass, moon falls towards us because of our greater mass. the big bang ( if that really did happen ) has something to do with everything. <br>  n yeah, stop criticising the atheists, they dont want to believe in the existence of supernatural, fine, u better try proving ur self correct, dont bother saying that they're wrong.<br>  Scinece and religion are not at loggergeads with each other, its just that science is to young to understand religion.|`|GaKjyr6xaa	The moon has gravity, a pencil has gravity just not as much as earth or the sun|`|Wr09qsYMaa	The moon is smaller than earth therefore gravity is less.

No big bang theorist is making any claims that there was any bang or that it was big.  It comes out of a purer and truer language called mathematics, and it is quite fascinating.  It's just that you need some scientific background to appreciate and understand what is going on.  This theory has held true for over 50 years now, and more and more confirmation is coming in.  The discovery of the cosmic microwave background in the 1990s pretty much confirmed the expansion of the universe, which is all the "big bang" theory is saying.<br>  <br>  But I like your big Aquarium idea too.  Only problem is, God doesn't clean the acquarium, nor protect his back yard from pests (humans).<br>  <br>  Churches are places that don't pay taxes on the money they are given by people that would like to believe somebody up there loves us.

Resolving that issue to your satisfaction can help you to see what the future holds for our planet.<br>  MANY scientists who have in depth studied the universe and our earth have seen evidences that point to the existence of a Creator, that God is behind it. Consider the comments from just?one:<br>  Professor Paul Davies writes in The Mind of God: “The existence of an orderly, coherent universe containing stable, organized, complex structures requires laws and conditions of a very special kind.”<br>  After discussing a number of “coincidences” that astrophysicists and others have noted, Professor Davies adds: “Taken together, they provide impressive evidence that life as we know it depends very sensitively on the form of the laws of physics, and on some seemingly fortuitous accidents in the actual values that nature has chosen for various particle masses, force strengths, and so on. .?.?. Suffice it to say that, if we could play God, and select values for these quantities at whim by twiddling a set of knobs, we would find that almost all knob settings would render the universe uninhabitable. In some cases it seems as if the different knobs have to be fine-tuned to enormous precision if the universe is to be such that life will flourish. .?.?. The fact that even slight changes to the way things are might render the universe unobservable is surely a fact of deep significance.”<br>  What it signifies to many is that our earth, along with the rest of the universe, was produced by a purposeful Creator. If that is so, we need to find out why he formed the earth in the first place. We also need to ascertain, if we can, what his purpose is for the earth. In this connection a strange anomaly appears. Despite the widespread popularity of atheism, a surprising number of people still hold belief in an intelligent Creator. Most churches of Christendom nominally speak of an almighty God and Creator of our universe. Yet, rarely do any of these religions speak with confidence and conviction about earth’s future in God’s?purpose.<br>  What Does the Bible Say?<br>  It is logical to look to a source of information that is widely accepted as coming from the Creator. That source is the Bible. One of the simplest and clearest statements in it regarding the future of our earth is found at Ecclesiastes 1:4. We read: “One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh: but the earth abideth for ever.” (King James Version) The Bible is straightforward in explaining why Jehovah God created the earth. It also shows that he placed it in just the right position in the universe and in relation to our sun to sustain life on it. Almighty God inspired the ancient prophet Isaiah to write: “This is what Jehovah has said, the Creator of the heavens, He the true God, the Former of the earth and the Maker of it, He the One who firmly established it, who did not create it simply for nothing, who formed it even to be inhabited: ‘I am Jehovah, and there is no one else.’”—Isaiah 45:18.<br>  But what of man’s developing the means to destroy all life on the earth? In his incomparable wisdom, God declares that he will step in before mankind can destroy all life on our planet. Note this reassuring promise in the Bible’s last book, Revelation: “The nations became wrathful, and your own wrath came, and the appointed time for the dead to be judged, and to give their reward to your slaves the prophets and to the holy ones and to those fearing your name, the small and the great, and to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.”—Revelation 11:18.<br>  Jehovah reveals to us what was his original purpose in creating the earth, this jewel in space, as an astronaut circling the earth described it. God purposed it to be a global paradise, comfortably populated by humans—men and women—all living in peace and harmony. He arranged to populate the planet gradually by allowing the first human pair to produce offspring. For the first human couple’s pleasure and enjoyment, Jehovah had brought a small section of the earth into a paradise condition. As the procreation of human families would proceed over the years and centuries, the garden of Eden would gradually be extended until Genesis 1:28 would be fulfilled: “God said to them: ‘Be fruitful and become many and fill the earth and subdue it.’”<br>  As we now see the sorry plight of the earth and its inhabitants, does it mean that God’s original purpose for the earth has failed? Or has he changed his purpose and decided that because of mankind’s waywardness, he will let the planet be ruined altogether and start again, as it were? No, we can be sure that neither of these situations is true. The Bible tells us that whatever Jehovah purposes must eventually take place, that whatever he decides cannot be thwarted by any individual or even by an unexpected development. He ***|`|S0QWZCQiaa	he created earth and people to be tested and to worship him he doesnt need worship but commands it from us he is the most merciful so he created us to bestow his mercy upon us|`|h61uE7YIaa	wow...you need some help with grammar|`|7cogf3U1aa	God is not neglecting anything. He told us to take care of one another and it's our selfishness and greed that leaves others without the basic necessities of life. Those that are rich and upper income, according to God, are supposed to help those that are considered low or no income and the homeless. Perhaps you should read the story of Lazarus and the rich man; (Luke 16:19-31) or (Mark 12:28-31) these may help you understand.<br>  <br>  You are not a pet, God said man is created in His image. How can we be considered a pet if we have any likeness or anything like Him. Our pets have no likeness or any linking identity to us. We can, however, prove an identify to God and Christ.<br>  <br>  God's house is where He choses it to be. His dwelling place (home) is the Heaven of Heaven's.<br>  <br>  As far as the Big Bang, it probably happened just like they say. It tells how the Big Bang occured but it cannot tell where those things came from to make the Big Bang happen. Science always proves what God says, it never disproves Him. God has always used the physical things of this world to create what is contained in this world. Like people. The bible says, man was made from the dust of the ground, (Gen 2:7). Science cannot prove that we were not made from dirt. It has proven that all the minerals, chemicals and such, we are composed of, can be found in the earth.
AA10311549	Our understanding of human sexuality and sexual orientation is vastly different now from what it was even 100 years ago let alone when Paul was writing Romans Ch 1.<br>  <br>  Paul, and all other authors at the time, had no conception of sexual orientation, exclusive homosexuality, or of bisexuality.  Loving committed same-sex relationships would never have occurred to him.  Paul was a product of his times.  To realize this just look at what he wrote about slavery or women's (lack of) rights.  In Romans he speaks of people who have ALREADY abandoned God and THEN became prey to their lusts.  <br>  <br>  As we get a better understanding of humanity and the human condition we get a better understanding of how best to obey christ's basic rule of love.  (Which replaced "the Mosaic Law -- read Galatians)<br>  <br>  Note that eventually we have been able to understand that slavery was wrong and that women DID have rights.  We are also starting to realize that committed same-sex relationships are exactly that, and not to be condemned.<br>  <br>  Christ Himself, makes NO mention of homosexuality.  Many people -- many Christian people -- believe that being gay and Christian are NOT in opposition. <br>  <br>  See any of the following sites:<br>  <a href="http://www.soulforce.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.soulforce.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gaychristianonline.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychristianonline.org</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gaychurch.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychurch.org</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gaychristiansurvivors.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gaychristiansurvivors.com</a><br>  <br>  There are many more including support groups for gay people of specific denominations. <br>  <br>  Catholic: Dignity USA <a href="http://www.dignity.usa.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dignity.usa.org</a><br>  Evangelicals Concerned: <a href="http://www.ecwr.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecwr.org</a><br>  More Light Presbyterians: <a href="http://www.mlp.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlp.org</a><br>  United Church of Christ: <a href="http://www.ucccoalition.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucccoalition.org</a><br>  and others (google gay and specific denomination)<br>  <br>  There are many excellent books available too for the Gay Christian<br>  "Gay Christian 101" by Rick Brentlinger<br>  [See also the website: <a href="http://gaychristan101.com]" rel="nofollow">http://gaychristan101.com]</a><br>  "The Children are Free" by Rev. Jeff Miner & John Tyler Connoley<br>  "The Church and the Homosexual" by John J. McNeill (Catholic)<br>  "Homosexuality and Christian Faith" ed. by Walter Wink<br>  "Jesus, the Bible, and Homosexuality" by Jack Rogers<br>  "What the Bible Really Says About Homosexuality" by Daniel A. Helminiak<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Please note that answers such as JOHN's  are written in ignorance.  It is HE who is confused.  Being exclusively gay, or exclusively heterosexual, or bisexual is simply how God made us.  It is ONLY people like JOHN who believe that it is a "punishment" or a "trial" to be overcome.  The formula is simple.  "God is love and he who abides in love abides in God and God in him."   A loving committed relationship is exactly that, nothing more, nothing less, and certainly NOT a sin.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  And people like DANIEL J confuse sexual orientation with libido.  It is one's libido which urges to have sex or take delight in sexual pleasure.  Sexual orientation is a condition and merely directs who we are physically and emotional attracted to.  Using our faculty of sex can be either a good thing or a bad thing.  It can be used a measure of our lust, or it can be used in the unitive and joyful merging of two people in an intimate relationship and one of the greatest gifts given to us by God.  There is nothing essentially different from a loving committed same-sex marriage than a heterosexual one where children can also not be conceived.  The physical form of the sex act is trivial in comparison to the relationship itself and the love which it can engender.  All those people who like JOHN or Daniel J would want us to be forever denied this possibility, because they erroneously keep thinking of only the sex act.  But marriage, and interpersonal relationships, are infinitely more than this.  If a committed relationship engenders love, self-sacrifice, giving of oneself to our partner it must necessarily bring us closer to Christ.  Annd NO, God does not hate gays, and people who state this are only baring their own hatreds and intollerances.<br>  <br>  And one last thing.  Look at all the so-called "abominations" found in Leviticus that these people are so apt to quote.  Most of these portions of Mosaic Law make no sense for us today and no one really follows most of them.  And this injunction about "lying with a man as a women" etc is one of them.  I am certain that these same quoters would be aghast if we adopted all of that society's mores concerning men, women, and slaves.  Note also that the Hebrew word which has been translated as "abomination" is not accurate.  A better translation would be "it is against the law."|`|AA12165299	how can one be repentant of a sin if they live in it everyday by choice without making any effort to be free from that sin...does God forgive that kind of sin...if i choose to lie everyday am i really repentant and sorry for that sin of lying...no...so why should God forgive me of that sin...|`|H9AlDTZOaa	2 points|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	God says that homosexual behavior is an abomination to Him...all sin stinks in His nostrils, homosexuality is no more a sin than lying...<br>  All of those who commit sin without repenting go to hell, that is what God decided, so what are we going to do about it ?

We are made in his image, and He has a love for us that goes beyond what our finite minds can comprehend. Now, if you believe that homosexuality isn't wrong then that is another issue. God created Adam and Eve as an example of how man and woman should come together and procreate. When one's heart is turned away from what God has declared as sin in the Bible, whether it is homosexuality, drugs, adultery, stealing etc, then that is where the main problem comes in at. Each person must examine themselves and see if they are walking in the light that God has shown us. If we decide to disobey, then we will eventually become set in our ways, and we will not be able to change even if we wanted.|`|24H2CMHMaa	god dont hate gays he hates the devil for makeing turn in to a pervert.<br>  <br>  <br>  read john 3:16 he died for you to be born again john 3:1-7|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The bible teaches that, to God, homosexuality is a sin.<br>  <br>  God loves people, but He will not condone sin, nor will a homosexual gain entrance to heaven.  His own word teaches this in 1st Corinthians.<br>  <br>  I do not believe it is hateful to answer a question from scripture.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	God isn't anti-gay. He never was, nor were His early followers. Europe developed homophobia in the middle ages, and translators put that homophobia into the Bible. You won't find it in the original Hebrew and Greek.<br>  <br>  Don't let ignorant people keep you from God. He made you and loves you... just the way you are.<br>  <br>  Edit: Too bad the bashers didn't heed your request to leave.
xvxT46iJaa	I'm not really sure what you want me to say, but i think people self harm because they don't know another way of letting out how they feel. I also think that it's their way of coping with what's going on and calming down when you are stressed out. I think it's like an extreme version of punching the wall when you're angry, purely because you don't know what else to do, or how to let out what you're feeling without getting physical.<br>  I'm not going to sit here and judge people who self harm, until you've walked a mile in some one's shoes, and dealt with their problems i don't think any one has the right to. I do however think that they should seek some kind of help. Talk to a friend/parent/helpline, and don't feel like you are alone.|`|RShYFxA9aa	No one in their right mind is going to sit here and defend self injury. It is maladaptive and is often disturbing to others (often others can have a visceral initial reaction to it).<br>  <br>  HOWEVER<br>  <br>  People make do with what they have. It's not a 'good' thing to do... but sometimes it feels like it is necessary. Problems with SI *should* be addressed early on... but often aren't. The "cutting" is rarely the real issue-- but the behavior is often overly focused on, as it scares others.<br>  <br>  The real problem is that it is a "growing epidemic." Emerging copycat behaviors are not a good thing. Honestly, it offends me/makes me uncomfortable when people put self-inflicted injuries on display... not exactly sure why. But even those people deserve help; the "attention-seekers" just need a different kind than those who hide it.|`|AA10280598	I think anyone who does this needs to seek out some kind of help. It is never okay to hurt yourself. You don't deserve it and even if you think noone cares, God cares and he did not create you for no reason. You are worthy to be happy and no matter what you have done in the past you can seek redemption thru Him. He loves you as you are.|`|s1GccsZ9aa	its definitely not the answer to any problems.  you have to look to God for help, not self inflicted pain.|`|6uFaP2OAaa	In my opinion cutting and self injury is completely pointless.  People should learn to let their frustration out through other ways.  If they need to feel physical pain, take up a sport like hockey where you're likely to get yourself injured.  <br>  <br>  Also you don't really need to make a point that satanism and atheism are different things; most everybody knows they are, and those that don't are probably too into their own religion to listen to your explanation anyways :P|`|S4zNEAFJaa	It must hurt, so therefor, it can't be good for you.
e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	If you do not think that you are gay, you probably should not have started your statement or question with that phrase. It seems to me that you are thinking about it... maybe just a little but who knows. <br>  <br>  Did your friend return and tell you she was gay? <br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with hanging with anyone (gay or straight) who has a crush on you, as long as you are honest with him or her and they respect your stance. You really did not ask a question, so I am not sure what you are searching for. <br>  <br>  You can consider a person's sexuality openly by respecting that and considering it. If it is a girl who has a crush on you, make sure she understands that you do not feel the same way and that since you have always been friends and that will not change.

Pero de ello he aprendido mucho y he evolucionado. <br>  Ahora, yo si creo que exista la reencarnacion, o sea, que puede que esta sea la primera vez que estas (tu, o sea, tu alma) en este planeta, o puede que ya lleves bastantes vidas aqui. Si la vida pasada INvolucionaste en lugar de evolucionar, te tocara algo peor en la siguiente, o si evolucionas, puedes salir de este planeta.

De todos modos la religion mas que hablar de la vida eterna tambien lo justifica con la nocion de KARMA que dice que al final recibes lo que das.<br>  Yo soy mas tendente a pensar eso y realmente creo que el sufrimiento es necesario pero visto que el anormal de Bush sigue tan fresco y que Pinochet murio en la cama ya no se que pensar si te digo la verdad. Estoy por hacerme adorador del diablo y asi joder la parva a base de bien.|`|ec53cfbb7de0c652a72921023b26d46caa	EN EFECTO, Dios permite la maldad, y millones de seres humanos la practican deliberadamente. Por ejemplo, declaran guerras, matan a ni?os en los bombardeos, arrasan los terrenos y provocan hambres. Millones fuman y contraen cáncer de pulmón, cometen adulterio y se contagian de enfermedades de transmisión sexual, abusan del alcohol y enferman de cirrosis, por citar algunos casos. Tales personas no desean realmente que se elimine la maldad, sino, más bien, sus consecuencias. Cuando recogen lo que han sembrado, preguntan indignadas: “?Por qué yo?”, y culpan a Dios. Como dice Proverbios 19:3, “la necedad del hombre malogra sus empresas y luego su corazón se irrita contra Dios” (Pontificio Instituto Bíblico). Por otra parte, si Dios les impidiera seguir practicando el mal, protestarían por la pérdida de libertad.<br>  <br>   <br>  Jehová permite la maldad principalmente para responder al desafío de Satanás el Diablo. Este alegó que Dios no podía tener a hombres en la Tierra que fueran leales a él bajo prueba (Job 1:6-12; 2:1-10). Jehová consiente que siga con vida para darle la oportunidad de que pruebe su afirmación (éxodo 9:16). En su afán por demostrar que tiene razón, el Diablo sigue hoy causando dificultades para que el hombre se vuelva contra Dios (Revelación 12:12). No obstante, al igual que Job y Jesús, los cristianos verdaderos de la actualidad se mantienen íntegros (Job 27:5; 31:6; Mateo 4:1-11; 1 Pedro 1:6, 7).<br>  un dia viajaba en un colectivo y detras del asiento del chofer lei esto"cuando intentes todo y nada de resultado consulta el manual de intruccion" y al lado se hallaba una biblia <br>  piensalo|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Por tu pregunta veo que no crees en Dios, claro que existe y por eso estas aquí. No es culpa de Dios lo que haga la mano del hombre ni tiene culpa Dios de que el hombre prefiera andar por malos caminos y no por los buenos, no es culpa de Dios que el hombre se deje dominar más por el diablo que por los mandamientos de éL.  Dios es bueno y NO  permite el mal. Sucede por la mano del hombre que se resiste en creer en El y en ser bueno. Las religiones no son un instrumento de consuelo son para ense?arnos los caminos del bien, independientemente de la religión que profeses siempre será la misma, ....los caminos del bien.  El mal lo hace la mano del hombre y por eso es que hay tanto sufrimiento en el mundo y no es culpa de Dios. El es nuestro Padre y nunca un padre quiere el mal para sus hijos. Te aconsejo leas más y te instruyas mejor en cuanto a la Ley de Dios y lo que profesan las Santas Escrituras. Y si estoy de acuerdo contigo en cuando a que hay que terminar con el sufrimiento ahora,?Cómo? Ser mejores personas, querer al prójimo como a nosotros mismos, no hacer el mal, tratar de ayudar a los demás, evitar las guerras en el mundo, etc. En fin seria muy extenso poder darte una razón explicita a tu pregunta. Y eso del que calla Otorga no se a que viene. Solo tratemos de ser buenos y ayudar a los demás y verás como todo en el mundo mejorará. En cuanto a que dicen las religiones que todo cambiará en la otra vida. No sé cual religión dice eso porque hasta ahora ninguna lo ha dicho. Ahi estas cambiando de tema, pasando de la religión a lo científico que es la REENCARNACIóN algo que aún está en estudio y no se sabe si reencarnamos o no, independientemente que tengamos eso que nombran deya-bu. y estudiosos del tema como Brian Weiss que es cientifico y médico psiquiatra que expresa muy bien de acuerdo a sus investigaciones sobre la reencarnación.

iLFYj6Qgaa	I think you should only say gay when you mean gay (a person that has a relationship with someone of the same gender... but of course you already knew that). I don't see the point in using it to say lame when you have enough words already to say that.<br>  And, by the way, why were you talking during class? Aren't you supposed to listen to the teacher and talk during breaks? lol<br>  <br>  P.S. Why do some people here say that gay has a negative meaning? It's just a word, guys. If you think it's negative, that's only in your own heads. Not in everybody's, and certainly not in mine. It's the fact that you use it in a negative expression that gives it a bad connotation...|`|pTv1Dc2Oaa	I have a gay friend, and she doesn't mind the word being used. <br>  <br>  I'm straight and I actually think it shouldn't be used. I think connoting the word 'gay' with things that you consider 'bad' is sending a negative message.<br>  <br>  As I'm sure you know- the word gay used to just mean happy. The gay rights movement used this word to mean something positive so that homosexuals could be thought of in a positive light. The fact that people have turned this word into something negative is kind of a slap in the face to gay rights activists of the past.<br>  <br>  Also, it's so typical. Everyone who is young calls each other gay- it's not even original or clever. By using the word you're just following the crowd. It's not cool in my opinion, or right.|`|GGX2s1S9aa	I honestly find it offensive...<br>  <br>  I do think there are other words that can portray what you want to say.<br>  <br>  But maybe that's just because I have lots of gay friends, and my sister is lesbian. lol|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	Lame would insult lame people wouldn't it?You should use something that nobody is, like "that's so Ancient Sumerian."|`|593f5a959e494d93b72266dbf2f2bd3faa	you should go up to your teacher and slap the "politically correct crap" right out of her big , fat liberal mouth.|`|fhWrgq0baa	I think it's derogatory and the way it's used is just plain wrong, but it's pretty common for teenagers to say since it's "an expression".

I wish I am the lucky one to sit next to you. <br>  <br>  Still, rules are rules. May be the teacher could not reach other students because of your talking.

kK4GG6Z2aa	Depends on how they use their money I guess.  To be wealthy and not want to give back to society is an abomination to me.  Now it seems many of the rich have lost an awful lot of their money in this present economic crisis.  I think it's not how much you give rather than what 'spirit' it is given in.  Many give to charity to off set their taxes whilst others give genuinly to help others because the are good people. God doesn't mind people getting rich - he only told one man to give up his riches to follow him - that was because even though the man wanted to follow Jesus - jesus could see in his heart that money meant more to him than anything. When challenged to give away his money to the poor he walked away from Jesus.  Whereas the tax collector (who were hated by the Jews as he essentially being one of them worked for the romans) wanted to follow Jesus and without being told gave back all the money out of his own pocket.  So deep down it's about motive rather than amount.  Jesus was more impressed with the widow who gave her last 'penny' into the poor box - than the man who gave hundreds but was boastful and puffed up about it and expected a reward. God encourages us to use our money wisely - but not stack it up without giving to those less fortunate.  Greed is an awful thing and now we are reaping the rewards of that greed.  I do believe that it's OK to have a good income - but footballers and super stars and now it seems bankers earn an obscene amount of money and it causes such pain to others who are struggling to survive- be it in this country or the African plains.|`|VUfT35UQaa	It's not a sin to live well if you have earned your money fairly. It is however a sin if you hoard money you do not need without helping out charities. A lot of celebrities do their part by earning money for their skills and then donating 10% to Charities.<br>  <br>  The Jonas Brothers are *very* Christian and no doubt *very* well off due to their hard work and talent, and they donate a lot of money to their 'change for the children' charity.<br>  <br>  And ignore the rude answers, some people have nothing better to do than mock other people's faith.|`|H9AlDTZOaa	It is easier for a camel to enter in the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God|`|6RCHJQfQaa	Camel and the eye of the needle.|`|a5ef125f73c7e0507eb991485e86abc2aa	While I do believe that God blesses us and it is possible for Christians to be wealthy, you are right that they should not hoard it. God blesses us and it turn we should bless others. The thing I would like to add though is that God loves us anyway and if those people are true Christians than they would still go to Heaven, but they should be prepared to possibly have as many rewards where it matters. Jesus may be disappointed, but he will take all true Christians to Heaven with Him because He knows that we are not perfect. Haters are the only ones who expect Christians to be perfect and they use it to deny Him, but that will only hurt them in the end, not us.|`|1jGEeMDYaa	There are some filthy rich people who donate A LOT to charities and are still filthy rich.

The problem with rich people is that money can become their God and not the true God. That is what Jesus would not like.|`|UVVce5hTaa	The fact is that conservative Christians give more to charity than any other group in America.<br>  <br>  It is easier for a camel to enter in the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God<br>  <br>  When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished and said, "Who, then, can be saved?"<br>  <br>  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	ok people!<br>  it is NOT a sin to be rich,the sin comes when people put their wealth ahead of Almighty God.<br>  Jesus knows their heart and will judge accordingly.<br>  how do we know they are not using their wealth to help people less fortunate?<br>  when you read those scriptures,are you really looking at what He was saying?<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|47a9f147d11fee144c4019cdc8cbba87aa	No Esther, but God does.

It is those who become consumed in their own wealth and do not honor God that are sinful. As for your question it is a very vague question. Jesus would be more concerned with how these people are honoring him with their money, rather then simply "If they were filthy rich". If they are not honoring him but still claiming to be Christians, he would consider them hypocrites and dishonoring his name. <br>  <br>  It is easy for people to call themselves Christians and of course no one is perfect but a true man of God does everything in his power to try and demonstrate God through his actions.|`|Xuw8v8bPaa	Yes Jesus said "give their riches to the poor" but, I don't think money has anything to do with what he would think of you.

At least that is what I think.|`|jOPUBmlJaa	I think, (if he had existed) he would tell people follow him and we would have a more natural lifestlye, and because of this the money system would fail and the rich's money would have no value.|`|QIGtbYpEaa	WHEN Jesus comes back yea he'll take the rich people if they have confessed there sins and believe in Jesus, like what he did and also the Holy Spirit and God well there the same thing but u know|`|24H2CMHMaa	if jesus comes back and he will soon he will be a shame of them<br>  like jesus siad the rich man dont go to heaven beuase he to earthly.<br>   and if he realy christians he pick up his cross and follow him.|`|bHI4NLonaa	If Jesus came back, what would he think of a person who judged rich people?|`|AAoQzU7oaa	God is sovereign and that means he can choose whomever he wishes to be rich or poor......<br>  <br>  with lots of money comes lots of responsibility and most people are not responsible enough to handle lots of money so God blesses only those whom are capable of handling great wealth.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	He would not be favorably impressed.  I would have a hard time believing the person was truly a Christian if he was "filthy rich".  Well off, OK.  But to have  that much means you are holding on to it and not being a good steward  with what God has given you.  Money is to be used to meet needs, not hoarded.
AA12163032	I think you are referring to...<br>  You shall not covet your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, nor his male servant, nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey, nor anything that is your neighbor’s. Exodus 20:17<br>  <br>  Covet is defined best as greed, not just envy. <br>  <br>  There are commandments against child molestation and drugs, in the same chapter you were most likely reading from...<br>  Thou shalt not kill. ~ Exodus 20:13<br>  That includes killing yourself with things like drugs.<br>  <br>  You shall not commit adultery. ~ Exodus 20:14<br>  <br>  Jesus gave an in-depth talk about this...<br>  <br>  You have heard that it was said, 'Do not commit adultery.' But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ~ Matthew 5:27-28<br>  <br>  So child molestation falls under adultery.  By the way Jesus is not saying thinking about it is just as bad as doing it.  But we should do neither.<br>  ----<br>  Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,<br>        for they will be filled. ~ Matthew 5:6<br>  <br>  If you search the Bible with an open mind you can find the answers with the help of God.  <br>  <br>  Some useful tools...<br>  <a href="http://amazingfacts.org/" rel="nofollow">http://amazingfacts.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.adventistdirectory.org/new/FindByType.aspx?EntityType=C" rel="nofollow">http://www.adventistdirectory.org/new/Fi...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bibleuniverse.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bibleuniverse.com/</a><br>  <br>  God bless!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	There are.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Those fall under Thou shall not kill.

The first and foremost commandment is to love the Lord God with all your heart, soul, and mind, and to love your neighbor as yourself. Molesting someone is obviously not a loving act, not to mention it's adultery. Loving your neighbor as yourself means that you have to love and respect yourself, and intoxicating yourself isn't respecting your body.
22gnldgPaa	Tu soulignes là une particularité qu'il vaut la peine de souligner. Dans les nombreux manuscrits de la Bible que nous possédons, le mot "ame" apparait des dizaines de fois. Dans les écritures, le mot “ame” rend l’hébreu 'nèphèsh' et le grec 'psukhê'. Si, à chaque fois que l'on rencontre ces deux mots, hébreux et grec, on traduisait simplement par "ame", plus personne ne douterait de ce qu'enseigne réellement la Bible sur l'ame. La Bible s'expliquerait d'elle-même.<br>  <br>  Malheureusement, les traducteurs de la chrétienté, influencés par leur doctrine religieuse piquée aux philosophes pa?ens, grecs, n'ont pas eu l'honnêteté de traduire toujours 'nèphèsh' et 'psukhê' par "ame". La raison est simple à comprendre : beaucoup de versets de la Bible disent que l'ame mange, boit, pleure, dort, souffre et... meurt ! Ben oui ! D’après l’usage qu’en fait la Bible, ce terme désigne soit une personne, soit un animal, soit la vie qui anime l’un ou l’autre. <br>  <br>  Donc, l'ame meurt. Et après ? Ben rien. On retourne à la poussière, comme Dieu l'avait dit (Genèse 3:19). Du coup, tout ce que la chrétienté (ou l'Islam, également) a piqué aux religions pa?ennes issues de Babylone s'effondrent aussi : enfer de feu, rotissoires, royaume souterrain de Satan, paradis au ciel, purgatoire, limbe, indulgences...<br>  <br>  Bon débarras ! Voila qui nous libère de pas mal de mensonges (Jean 8:32). Ainsi, la vérité révélée par Dieu nous apparait plus claire et plus en accord avec l'idée que l'on se fait d'un Dieu juste, sage et plein d'amour. Et quand on découvre un passage qui parle de feu, de souffrance et de jugement éternel, on analyse sereinement le contexte pour comprendre de quoi il s'agit... sachant pertinemment que la Bible ne se contredit pas.|`|Xqu3682haa	je vais vous accordez cette faveur et je ne vais pas répondre|`|11a61faa3a7315cdae22318920954621aa	Dieu est immortel,il appara?trait que nous le sommes aussi,c'est a cause de notre condition d'évolution ,qu'actuellement nous avons du mal a l'imaginer.Nous sommes egalement restreint dans nos vues et pensées par les écrits saints,cependant comment pouvoir croire que Dieu le créateur de l'univers,voudrait nous astreindre et nous limiter a des écritures faites par des gens plus ou moins inspirer.Quand je contemple une nuit étoilées et pense a  son créateur ,qui nous offre un spectacle grandiose et permanent ce serait l'oppose a cela que je pense qu'il nous offre.Ne pas se restreindre dans nos pensées et explorations,et prendre un plaisir a découvrir les joyaux qu'il  laisse découvrir ,a ceux qui se donne la peine de le faire.Les grandes religions qui ont vue le jour au moyen orient s'oppose les unes aux autres ,les gens de ces religions se ha?ssent,et se tuent au nom même de Dieu.Si les écrits de ces religions étaient "Les parole de Dieu",elle ne pourrait pas diviser les hommes,les rendrent haineux,intolérables,et assassins de leurs frères.La parole de Dieu serait absolu sans contestation possible,et etant parfaite,unirait les hommes au lieu de les diviser.Pour dire ce que je viens d'ecrire,a une autre epoque j'aurais ete mit sur le bucher.La plupart d'entre nous seraient d'accord a penser que ce serait excessif,et c'est un exemple de l'evolution que nous avons faites depuis le moyen age.Avec la grace de Dieu nous evolueront encore,lui a mon avis n'attend que ca ,tout en nous laissant le choix de venir a lui a la vitesse que nous avons choisis de le faire.Dieu nous a cree libre de penser ,d'etre,et d'agir,et aussi incroyable que cela puisse paraitre,beaucoup renonce a cela et se laisse enfermer dans des croyances religieuses desuetes.Qu'ils prennent la liberte de le faire,sans oublier le respect qu'ils doivent a ceux qui pensent differement Nous avons l'eternite devant nous,mais pourquoi attendre si longtemps a nous respecter et aimer les uns les autres.|`|3b298aecf52dbcf3a47e2b94be056bf0aa	Je ne suis déjà pas d'accord avec les prémisses de ta question , lorsque tu affirmes : "Dieu est immortel;nous sommes tous d`accord."<br>  <br>  Non , Dieu a quelques milliers d'années , et il moura lorsque l'Homme passera à un autre "dieu" .

Il y vécu en dépensant l'argent en jeux de hasard, alcool, femmes. Puis un jour il fut battu et volé, ceux qui hier encore etaient ses amis ce detournèrent de lui. Il retourna alors auprès de son père et lui demanda son pardon. Son père lui accorda sa misericorde. Il fit tué le veau gras et fit un banquet en l'honneur du retour de son fils. <br>  <br>  <br>  Saint Fran?ois d'Assise était riche, dispendieux ...

KBBonf97aa	You're right.  Television and movies have made it fashionable for girls to label themselves bisexual and "dabble" in same-sex relationships, even though the vast majority of them are straight.  Some are doing it because it's considered cool and others don't realize that same-sex attractions are normal during adolescence, but usually temporary, and have nothing to do with sexual orientation.  It has to do with hormones.<br>  <br>  If you attend your 10-year class reunion, you'll find that virtually all the girls who claimed to be bisexual as teenagers grew up to be happily heterosexual.  That's what happens when kids treat sexual orientation as a fashion statement.  Too bad "playing lesbian" makes life harder for kids who are struggling to accept their genuine homosexuality.  For them, sexual orientation isn't something they can wear for a while and discard when it's no longer in style.  And very often they're used and tossed aside by peers who want to satisfy their curiosity or test their own boundaries without the risk of being labeled gay.  And the bisexual tag gives them that freedom, but still allows them to run back to the security of their true orientation once the novelty wears off.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	I completely agree.They need to shut up and stay with what they know best-guys.They give bis a bad name.|`|ddxVPAUgaa	I think it is a trend (and you'll all go mad with me because of this, lol!), and it's one I follow. <br>  <br>  After a lot of consideration, I updated my status on MySpace to bisexual, and that's what I say I am if people ask.

He got the idea because he's God.  He created everything in the universe, so why would it be hard for him to think up the idea of coming into existence???  If  God created everything, than everything was his idea in the first place.

e4d0645999f7976ac8ec502018c5781eaa	If you are straight, why do you want to have sex with a woman? That is like a man on the down low saying that he only gets oral from a man but is not gay. <br>  <br>  You dont have to label yourself as straight, gay, bi, black, white or anything else. So many times we get caught up in labels that we do not follow our guts and explore the true paths we are supposed to lead. Sometimes, it is just a phase. <br>  <br>  If you do get involved with a girl, make sure she knows that you do not believe you are looking for a relationship and that you are just curious. Also, you hae to let your boyfriend know what's up and I would suggest going into things without him. I know that is a man's dream come true but it changes the dynamics of things. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|op3270fXaa	obviously as other ppl said if u wanna bang a woman then maybe ur bi or even lez should break-up with ur bf for a little and look for a woman if u have sex with her and u like it then ur bi so then maybe u can stay with u her|`|2rUpxpaXaa	maybe you can just have cyber sex with a girl instead of real so u wont be cheating|`|jIS8JBiJaa	bi-curious its normal to feel that way once in your life|`|KBBonf97aa	It's not uncommon to be curious, but it would be pretty sleazy to act on it, not only because you're involved with someone, but because you'd be using someone as a piece of meat to test your boundaries.  That would be dehumanizing to both yourself and the other woman.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I agree it seems you either actually bi-sexual or you are simple curious.   Ask yourself why want to have sex with a woman why do you think you would enjoy it?  Is there something your man is not doing to satisfy you sexual that you feel a woman can satisfy?<br>  <br>  You have been with your man for over a decade so you must really love him. Certainly if you feel deep down that you might be bi-sexual you should discuss this with your man. Who knows maybe he would be open for you all doing a threesome . However I would not risk throwing away an 11 year relationship due to a curiosity.|`|FHLKpNv4aa	bi-curios.Maybe bi-sexual.<br>  <br>  Don't act on it unless you want to end that 11 year relationship honestly.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	go to a party. you will find a drunk girl there. your bicourious.|`|JTSNljLhaa	then your not straight|`|g6cUQFuCaa	maybe ur not straight<br>  id say ur bi-curious

40c85b996c134163f45223b2c362cd80aa	The language of Scandinavia during the Viking Age is called "Old Norse" in English.  It was also known as "Donsk Tunga" (the Danish Tongue) and "Norr?nt Mál" (Norse-speak).   There was also a distinct dialect called "Old Guntish" spoken in Gotland.<br>  <br>  By the 14th century, Old Norse had splintered into the current Scandinavian and North Sea languages:  Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, Icelandic, and Faroese.  Of those, Icelandic bears the closest resemblance to Old Norse, although there is a dialect called  Elfdalian spoken by a very small population (less than 5000 native speakers) in part of Sweden which is also very close to Old Norse.<br>  <br>  Old Norse also influenced a number of modern languages besides those decended from it, including: English (words like "knife" and "egg" come to us from Old Norse), Scots, Manx Gaelic, the Normandy dialect of French, Russian, Finnish and Estonian.<br>  <br>  Finally up until fairly recently there were at least two "pidgin" forms of Norse:  "Norn" (a mixture of Norse and Gaelic spoken in the Scottish Isles like Orkney), and "Tavringer Romani" (a mixture of Norse and Rom spoken by Gypsies/Travellers in Scandinavia).|`|k1zMsWxOaa	The vikings spoke a language known as old norse.<br>  now-a-days a version of danish is spoke in norway, as the danish kingdom ruled it in the middle ages<br>  The closest language is icelandic, though there have been significant changes, and even in the viking age icelanders had their own, names and dialects.<br>  <br>  It also changed in their own time, many new routes were opened up by the vikings, and events like chrisitanity changed whole sections of culture. they even completely re-structured their alphabet at the time changing it from about 24 letters to 16|`|HPNymf0Waa	Uhmm...vikings come from Scandinavia. I would assume they speak the same languages now, although I don't see very many vikings in everyday life, hah :)<br>  <br>  Norwegian, is what you mean by Norse I presume.<br>  And Scandinavian, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Icelandic, Finnish(Finland is part of Scandinavia, so yeah)<br>  But seems more like Norwegian and such.<br>  Jeg snakker Norsk :D<br>  <br>  Didn't you already ask this?

No one comes to the Father except through me.  7 If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.” <br>  <br>  8 Philip said, “Lord, show us the Father and that will be enough for us.” <br>  9 Jesus answered: “Don’t you know me, Philip, even after I have been among you such a long time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?  10 Don’t you believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is in me? The words I say to you are not just my own. Rather, it is the Father, living in me, who is doing his work.  <br>  <br>  11 Believe me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least believe on the evidence of the miracles themselves.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	There is no other way to salvation than by faith in Jesus as your savior.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Not for YOU there isn't.

No one wants to sound like an uneducated douche right?  Not sure which bible you're reading, but i'm pretty sure "god" didn't kill jesus.  Jesus was a willing martyr who refused to stand up and fight for himself (in the story I mean). He surrendered his life, though nobody really asked him too.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

Then, the question "What was there before the Universe?" makes no sense; the concept of "before" becomes meaningless when considering a situation without time, and thus the concepts of cause and effect so necessary to the cosmological argument no longer apply.

bmoCpcdraa	hello, the folling is the myth allusions,,,,,Narcissus is the most beautiful boy whom many have ever seen, but he does not return anyone’s affections. One of the disappointed nymphs prays to the god of anger, Nemesis, that "he who loves not others love himself." Nemesis answers this prayer. Narcissus looks at his own reflection in a river and suddenly falls in love with himself. He can think of nothing and no one else. He pines away, leaning perpetually over the pool, until finally he perishes. <br>  <br>   The story of Narcissus includes the story of Echo, a nymph who falls in love with him. Echo falls under an unfortunate spell cast by Hera, who has suspected that Zeus is interested in her or, at least, in one of her nymph friends. Hera determines that Echo will always have the last word but never have the power to speak first. That is, she only can repeat other people's utterances. When the dying Narcissus calls "farewell" to his own image, Echo can only repeat the words—a final good-bye. In the place where Narcissus dies, a beautiful flower grows, and the nymphs call it Narcissus.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  <br>  Apollo and Hyacinthus are best friends. They compete to see who can throw a discus the farthest. In the competition, Apollo accidentally throws his discus into Hyacinthus, killing him. As Apollo holds the body of his best friend, he wishes that he himself would stop living so that the beautiful, young Hyacinthus could live on. As he speaks those words, the blood spilling from the dying youth turns the grass green, and a beautiful flower grows—the hyacinth.<br>  <br>  ...<br>  <br>  Adonis is an extremely handsome young man, and Aphrodite falls in love with him. She puts him in Persephone's care, but she also falls in love with him. Finally, Zeus intervenes and decides that Adonis shall spend half the year with Persephone and half the year with Aphrodite. One day, Adonis hunts a wild boar and thinks he killed it. But the boar was only wounded, and it fiercely lunges at Adonis as he approaches. Aphrodite flies to him and holds him, dying, in her arms. Flowers grow where the blood wets the ground.<br>  <br>  Analysis<br>  <br>  The story of Narcissus concerns the dangers of self-love. Western culture often returns to consider the nature of the self-absorbed individual. Literature, art, and philosophy have investigated the relative importance of self-love. Here, the extreme form of self-love is figured as a warning.<br>  <br>  Echo is yet another unfortunate female who is a victim of Hera's jealousy. The sad story of Echo’s unrequited love and Narcissus’s perverted love reveals the importance of natural imagery in Greek myths. Echo reflects the echoes people hear across empty spaces, and wildflowers were revered as physical reminders of a Greek's beauty and fertility.<br>  <br>  Together, the stories of Narcissus and Echo represent the tragedy of missed connections, for they both love wrongly. Narcissus loves simply a reflection; Echo loves someone who cannot love another. The Greek myths thus explore sad scenarios that leave certain characters unhappy or unfulfilled. It seems that the gods have the power to make everything "right" and could make love reciprocal, but they rarely choose to do so. From the troubles of love arise many the complex dramas of the human condition.<br>  <br>  In the story of Narcissus, natural imagery stands out. Typical of Greek mythology, elements in nature take on narrative significance and add a particular attitude to a tale. By setting the stories in such idyllic, natural settings as by the river where Narcissus falls in love with himself, the Greek storytellers conjured an imaginary world in which beauty and nature rule the imagination.<br>  <br>  The short myth of Apollo and Hyacinthus concerns the fragility of living. It seems strange that such an impressive god as Apollo should make such a tragic mistake, but this story shows a rare instance in which a god regrets an action and a time in which fate goes against a god's wishes. The tragedy of error thus extends to the powerful gods, not just the mortals on earth.<br>  <br>  The story also warns against the dangers of competition, for it is in this context that Hyacinthus dies. Competitions arise throughout Greek mythology, and not always to tragic effect. But in almost every case, competitions cause an important or dramatic situation to occur.<br>  <br>  Perhaps most importantly, the story of Hyacinthus concerns the cyclical relationship between life and death. Just after Hyacinthus dies, he is in a sense reborn as a flower. As in other stories of life after death, Hyacinthus's new form as a flower suggests that life cycles can recur from one natural state to another. In this case, it is hard to see what Hyacinthus retains of his human nature in having become a flower.<br>  <br>  Finally, the story displays an unusually human portrayal of a god. As good friends do, the two men share love and loyalty; Apollo shows both masculine heroism and sensitive compassion. Indeed, his love for his friend appears to be the main reason why Hyacinthus is able to live on.<br>  <br>  Another tragic|`|vhlORK4Waa	Hello<br>  <br>  the following makes mention of flowers in each of the myths for the chracters you mention.<br>  <br>  Narcissus or Narkissos in Greek mythology was a hero from the territory of Thespiae in Boeotia who was renowned for his beauty. In the various stories, he became obsessed with his own reflection in a pool, and for one reason or another, dies because of it.<br>  <br>  Hyacinth - In the myth, Hyacinth was a beautiful youth loved by the god Apollo. The two took turns throwing the discus. Hyacinth ran to catch it, to impress Apollo, was struck by the discus as it fell to the ground, and died.<br>  <br>  Another myth adds that the wind god Zephyrus was actually responsible for the death of Hyacinth. The boy's beauty caused a feud between Zephyrus and Apollo. Jealous that Hyacinth preferred the radiant archery god Apollo, Zephyrus blew Apollo's discus off course, so as to injure and kill Hyacinth. When he died, Apollo didn't allow Hades to claim the boy; rather, he made a flower, the hyacinth, from his spilled blood. According to Ovid's account, the tears of Apollo stained the newly formed flower's petals with the sign of his grief. However, the flower of the mythological Hyacinth has been identified with a number of plants other than the true hyacinth, such as the iris.<br>  <br>  <br>  Adonis - Adonis was certainly based in large part on Tammuz. His name is Semitic, a variation on the word "adon" meaning "lord" that was also used, as "Adonai", to refer to Yahweh in the Old Testament. When the Hebrews first arrived in Canaan, they were opposed by the king of the Jebusites, Adonizedek, whose name means "lord of Zedek" (Justice). Yet there is no trace of a Semitic cult directly connected with Adonis, and no trace in Semitic languages of any specific mythemes connected with his Greek myth; both Greek and Near Eastern scholars have questioned the connection. The connection in cult practice is with Adonis' Mesopotamian counterpart, Tammuz:<br>  <br>  "Women sit by the gate weeping for Tammuz, or they offer incense to Baal on roof-tops and plant pleasant plants. These are the very features of the Adonis cult: a cult confined to women which is celebrated on flat roof-tops on which sherds sown with quickly germinating green salading are placed, Adonis gardens... the climax is loud lamentation for the dead god.".   <br>  When the cult of Adonis was incorporated into Greek culture is debated: Hesiod made him the son of Phoinix, eponym of the Phoenicians, and his association with Cyprus is not attested before the classical era..<br>  <br>  Adonis was worshipped in unspoken mystery religions: not until Imperial Roman times does any written source mention that the women were consoled by a revived Adonis. The third century BCE poet Euphorion of Chalcis in his Hyacinth wrote "Only Cocytus washed the wounds of Adonis".Women in Athens would plant "gardens of Adonis" quick-growing herbs that sprang up from seed and died. The Festival of Adonis was celebrated by women at midsummer by sowing fennel and lettuce, and grains of wheat and barley. The plants sprang up soon, and withered quickly, and women mourned for the untimely death of the vegetation god <br>  <br>  Europa - Sources differ in details regarding Europa's family, but agree that she is Phoenician, and from a lineage that descended from Io, the mythical nymph beloved of Zeus, who was transformed into a heifer. She is said to be the daughter of Agenor, the Phoenician King of Tyre, and Queen Telephassa ("far-shining") or of Argiope ("white-faced"). Other sources, such as the Iliad, claim that she is the daughter of Agenor's son, the "sun-red" Phoenix. It is generally agreed that she had two brothers, Cadmus, who brought the alphabet to mainland Greece, and Cilix who gave his name to Cilicia in Asia Minor, with Apollodorus including Phoenix as a third. After arriving in Crete, Europa had three sons: Minos, Rhadamanthus, and Sarpedon, the three of whom became the three judges of the Underworld when they died. She married Asterion also rendered Asterius. According to mythology, her children were fathered by Zeus.<br>  <br>  There were two competing myths relating how Europa came into the Hellenic world, but they agreed that she came to Crete, where the sacred bull was paramount. In the more familiar telling she was seduced by the god Zeus in the form of a bull, who breathed from his mouth a saffron crocus and carried her away to Crete on his back— to be welcomed by Asterion,but according to a more literal, euhemerist version in Herodotus, she was kidnapped by Minoans, who likewise were said to have taken her to Crete. The mythical Europa cannot be separated from the mythology of the sacred bull, which had been worshipped in the Levant.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Halcon

If you are just experimenting to see what you like,let her know so that both of you can go into things openly and neither will have unrealistic expectations. Who knows? She may just be your future girlfriend. If not, then the two of you will have something to giggle about when you look back on your lives.

bmoCpcdraa	Mr Creme is an erstwhile Theosophist and student of the esotericist Alice Bailey, whose writings in the 1920s foretold the imminent coming of 'the Cosmic Christ'. Following this theme, in 1982, Mr Creme took out full page advertisements in newspapers around the world to announce that Maitreya had arrived in London on a flight from Pakistan, having descended from the Himalayan redoubt where he had been living with a community of ascended Masters, who are watching over Mankind with a concerned eye, and was now living among the Asian community awaiting the appropriate time to reveal himself.<br>  <br>  Mr Creme has apparently been in telepathic communication with one of these Masters since 1959. The announcement of Maitreya's arrival in London occasioned some excitement among newspapers of the day - there was a small stampede of reporters to the Brick Lane area of East London in search of the new Messiah. When he failed to materialise the newspapers promptly forgot all about Mr Creme. But he is one of the world's great and indefatigable optimists. Undeterred, he has continued to travel the world, lecturing about the coming of the Maitreya, and publishing his magazine Share International.<br>  <br>  In 1988 this published the first - and only - photograph of Maitreya, who had reportedly made a fleeting appearance at a prayer meeting in Nairobi. Since then he has maintained a resolutely low profile, apparently preferring to travel incognito. A regular feature in Share International are the letters from readers reporting chance encounters with mysterious strangers performing random acts of kindness. After telepathic consultation with his Master, Mr Creme is usually able to report that the 'mysterious stranger' was, in fact, Maitreya.<br>  <br>  When I contacted Mr Creme this week (by nothing more miraculous than telephone) to enquire about Maitreya's imminent appearance, he told me that the good news had first been given to a woman in Germany, who was told by Maitreya himself, 'through a familiar', to 'look out for a star'. Mr Creme's Master had confirmed that the star would be appearing shortly, would be seen by everybody throughout the world and that 'around a week' after that Maitreya would be making his appearance on American television.<br>  <br>  Did Mr Creme know what programme he would be appearing on? 'I do. But I'm not allowed to say'.<br>  <br>  Confusingly, it seems he will not actually be using the name Maitreya, although Mr Creme says that people will instantly recognise that he has a special message to impart. 'He will talk about the way to solve the present crisis, about the creation of trust and justice and the need of the world to share its resources.' Apparently, the 'Day of Declaration' when Maitreya reveals his true identity will follow shortly afterwards, ushering in a new, golden age when the world's resources will be redistributed through a specially constituted department of the United Nations.<br>  <br>  'Every nation will be asked to make an inventory, and to make over whatever they have in excess of their needs', Mr Creme told me. 'It's expected to happen quite quickly.'<br>  <br>  When I put it to Mr Creme that the timing of the bright star's appearance seemed to have a particularly seasonal resonance, he replied, 'That's why we're calling it a Christmas Miracle.'<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what to make of all this. But in the interests of balance, I consulted The Rapture Index - 'The prophetic speedometer of end-time activity'.<br>  <br>  While Mr Creme sees the new age of enlightenment arriving relatively painlessly, The Rapture Index, which is run by a fundamentalist Christian organisation in America, takes more of a fire-and-brimstone view of the future, regularly totting up all the factors necessary for the final apocalypse - war, famine, financial meltdown, 'false Christs' and 'Beast Government' among them. The current reading is 156 points. This, apparently, constitutes 'Heavy prophetic activity' - not good, but still a few reassuring notches below the alarming threshold of 160, when you are advised to 'Fasten your seat belts'.<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, I, for one shall be watching the skies more closely over the next few days and weeks.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  Both Matthew and Mark record the following statement:<br>  <br>   "For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect."<br>  <br>  No, this "Maitreya" person is a fake !<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><|`|AA11705909	This character Benjamin Creme has made a good living telling impressionable people about "Maitreya" He holds fringe meetings now and again but does not get any believers, even after 35 years.<br>  He seems  to believe it, I suppose it keeps him from drink eh?|`|Ghg0UIflaa	how do you eat that dish sounds good unless its to boney i like meat|`|mBHQEzd1aa	Never heard of this person.

In the one most commonly cited, Zeus lay with Metis, the goddess of crafty thought and wisdom, but he immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that Metis would bear children more powerful than the sire, even Zeus himself. In order to forestall these dire consequences, after lying with Metis, Zeus "put her away inside his own belly;" he "swallowed her down all of a sudden." He was too late: Metis had already conceived a child. Athena was born by emerging from Zues's head.<br>  <br>  Athena competed with Poseidon to be named after the greatest city-state in Athens. agreed that each would give the Athenians one gift and that the Athenians would choose the gift they preferred. Poseidon struck the ground with his trident and a spring sprang up, promising wealthy by trade on sea.  Athena just planeted an olive tree. Olives became the best source of money for trading, as Athens made it into an oil. Therefor, Athena won.|`|tYqUutidaa	Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, war, the arts, industry, justice and skill. She was the favorite child of Zeus. She had sprung fully grown out of her father's head. Her mother was Metis, goddess of wisdom and Zeus' first wife. In fear that Metis would bear a son mightier than himself. Zeus swallowed her and she began to make a robe and helmet for her daughter. The hammering of the helmet caused Zeus great pain in the form of headaches and he cried out in agony. Skilled Hephaestus ran to his father and split his skull open and from it emerged Athena, fully grown and wearing her mother's robe and helmet. She is the virgin mother of Erichthnonius.|`|DnwhJ4F6aa	Even the myth of her origin and the competition for Athens is overshadowed, in my opinion, by the role she plays in the Odyssey.

However, if they didn't register, your only hope would be oral history which you obviously don't have.

ZOifSvNhaa	“What God has yoked together let no man put apart.”—MATTHEW 19:6.<br>  <br>  Jehovah god placed the first man and woman together in a relationship that was to last forever. Jehovah wants couples to be married and committed forever. Marriages were not made to breakup<br>  <br>  OUR Maker, Jehovah God, instituted marriage as a permanent union between a man and a woman. Says Genesis 2:18, 22-24: “Jehovah God went on to say: ‘It is not good for the man to continue by himself. I am going to make a helper for him, as a complement of him.’ And Jehovah God proceeded to build the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and to bring her to the man. Then the man said: ‘This is at last bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh. This one will be called Woman, because from man this one was taken.’ That is why a man will leave his father and his mother and he must stick to his wife and they must become one flesh.”<br>  <br>  True, building a lasting, happy marriage is not easy, but it is certainly possible. Many couples have been happily married for 50, 60, or more years. How do they do it? They work at their marriage continually and unselfishly to “gain the approval” of their mate. (1 Corinthians 7:33, 34) That takes work. If you are willing to invest the time and effort, you too can build a happy marriage, one that will last a long time.|`|6ypnDnvLaa	Here are some that popped into my mind (better than nothing)|`|bfP9vz9Naa	It commands husbands to love their wives and wives to love their husbands.|`|pOP0Jt0Qaa	Deuteronomy 20:10-14<br>  Deuteronomy 22:28-29<br>  Deuteronomy 22:23-24|`|KWLlTIHXaa	"...three things remain: faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love."

Certains pensent que le nom était jugé trop saint pour être prononcé par des lèvres imparfaites. <br>  De même que la ou les raisons invoquées à l’origine pour cesser d’employer le nom divin sont obscures, de même on ne sait pas trop quand cette superstition s’imposa vraiment. Certains prétendent que ce fut après l’exil à Babylone (607-537 av.?n.?è.). Cette théorie, toutefois, s’appuie sur l’emploi prétendument restreint du nom par les derniers rédacteurs des écritures hébra?ques, une opinion qui ne résiste pas à l’analyse. Malaki, par exemple, fut sans doute un des livres des écritures hébra?ques écrits les derniers (dans la deuxième moitié du Ve?siècle av.?n.?è.), et il accorde une place de choix au nom divin YHWH (aujourd'hui connu sous YAWEH ou JEHOVAH).<br>  <br>  De nombreux ouvrages de référence ont émis l’avis que le nom tomba en désuétude vers 300 av.?n.?è. On a invoqué à l’appui de cette date l’absence du Tétragramme (ou de sa transcription) dans la traduction grecque des écritures hébra?ques appelée Septante, entreprise aux environs de 280 av.?n.?è. Il est vrai que les copies manuscrites de la Septante les plus complètes connues aujourd’hui substituent systématiquement les mots grecs Kurios (Seigneur) ou Théos (Dieu) au Tétragramme. Mais ces manuscrits principaux ne remontent qu’aux IVe et Ve?siècles de n.?è. On a retrouvé des copies antérieures qui, bien que fragmentaires, prouvent que les copies les plus anciennes de la Septante portaient bien le nom divin.<br>  <br>  La version grecque d’Aquila, qui date du IIe?siècle de n.?è., portait encore le Tétragramme en caractères hébreux. Aux environs de 245 de n.?è., Origène, érudit célèbre, produisit les Hexaples, reproduction en six colonnes des écritures hébra?ques inspirées?: 1)?l’original hébreu et araméen, accompagné 2)?d’une transcription en grec et des versions grecques 3)?d’Aquila, 4)?de Symmaque, 5)?de la Septante et 6)?de Théodotion. à propos de ce qu’ont révélé les copies fragmentaires connues actuellement, le professeur W.?Waddell déclare?: “?Dans les Hexaples d’Origène [...] les versions grecques d’Aquila, de Symmaque et de la LXX [Septante] représentaient toutes JHWH par ΠΙΠΙ?; dans la deuxième colonne des Hexaples, le Tétragramme était écrit en caractères hébreux.?” (The Journal of Theological Studies, Oxford, vol.?XLV, 1944, p.?158, 159). D’autres pensent que le texte original des Hexaples d’Origène portait le Tétragramme en caractères hébreux dans toutes les colonnes. Origène lui-même déclara que “?dans les manuscrits les plus fidèles LE NOM figure en caractères hébreux, toutefois non en [caractères] hébreux actuels, mais dans les plus anciens?”.<br>  <br>  Même encore au IVe?siècle de n.?è., Jér?me, le traducteur de la Vulgate, dit dans son prologue aux livres de Samuel et des Rois?: “?Nous trouvons aujourd’hui encore le nom de Dieu, lequel renferme quatre lettres [????], nous le trouvons exprimé en antiques lettres dans certains volumes grecs.?” (Mélanges théologiques, historiques et moraux, empruntés des ?uvres de Saint Jérome, traduit par F.-Z. Collombet, Paris, 1842, tome second, p.?115).<br>  <br>  Les prétendus chrétiens qui donc “?ont remplacé le Tétragramme par le mot kurios?” (Kurios = Seigneur) dans les copies de la Septante n’étaient pas les premiers disciples de Jésus. Ce furent des personnes des siècles suivants, où l’apostasie prédite s’était amplement développée et avait entamé la pureté des enseignements chrétiens. — 2Th 2:3?; 1Tm 4:1.|`|07baca48a25041de57d72d575df39d2aaa	Les noms de Dieu sont nombreux dans la Bible:<br>  <br>  El, Eloah, Elohim : Dieu<br>  El Shaddai : Le Tout-Puissant<br>  Jehovah ou Yahveh ou YHVH : L'Eternel<br>  "Le Même"<br>  Le Dieu des cieux et de la terre<br>  Le Dieu des cieux<br>  "Je suis", "Je suis celui qui suis"<br>  L'Ange de l'Eternel<br>  "Le Premier et le Dernier"<br>  <br>  Et j'en passe... et s?rement beaucoup...|`|386d468ede2f11653cccaa6c8e72fb62aa	Les grandes religions monothéiste font toutes référence à un seul dieu unique et chacune d'elle lui donne un mon différent.<br>  Yahvé, alla, dieu, ra (ancienne Egypte) etc..|`|638dadd53d9b5912274ff4de582cb8deaa	Dans chaque langue, tu as un ou plusieurs noms pour le désigner... tu n'as que l'embarras du choix|`|6f7OHONbaa	Il ya plusieurs "noms", en effet, mais tous désignent la même entité.Il ya autant de noms que d'humains, en fait...Ce qui me gêne, dans chaque religion, et en premier lieu les monothéistes, c'est qu'elles excluent de fait les femmes (pas de prêtresses, pas d'"imamesses", et dans les "textes" soi disant sacrés, une place riquiqui pour celles-ci...Que sont ces religions, sinon une confiscation totalitaire par les hommes, du pouvoir?

The breakup of the Ottoman Empire after the war created a number of new nation-states, but not a separate Kurdistan. Kurds, no longer free to roam, were forced to abandon their seasonal migrations and traditional ways. <br>  <br>  They have been fighting to establish a land of their own to follow their own culture nad traditiond freely but have not been succesful yet and all their efforts have been crushed so far.<br>  <br>  <br>  REgarding the Sunni/Shia muslims:<br>  <br>  Both Sunni and Shia Muslims share the most fundamental Islamic beliefs and articles of faith. The differences between these two main sub-groups within Islam initially stemmed not from spiritual differences, but political ones. Over the centuries, however, these political differences have spawned a number of varying practices and positions which have come to carry a spiritual significance.<br>  The division between Shia and Sunni dates back to the death of the Prophet Muhammad, and the question of who was to take over the leadership of the Muslim nation. Sunni Muslims agree with the position taken by many of the Prophet's companions, that the new leader should be elected from among those capable of the job. This is what was done, and the Prophet Muhammad's close friend and advisor, Abu Bakr, became the first Caliph of the Islamic nation<br>  <br>  The word "Sunni" in Arabic comes from a word meaning "one who follows the traditions of the Prophet."<br>  On the other hand, some Muslims share the belief that leadership should have stayed within the Prophet's own family, among those specifically appointed by him, or among Imams appointed by God Himself.<br>  <br>  The Shia Muslims believe that following the Prophet Muhammad's death, leadership should have passed directly to his cousin/son-in-law, Ali. Throughout history, Shia Muslims have not recognized the authority of elected Muslim leaders, choosing instead to follow a line of Imams which they believe have been appointed by the Prophet Muhammad or God Himself. The word "Shia" in Arabic means a group or supportive party of people. The commonly-known term is shortened from the historical "Shia-t-Ali," or "the Party of Ali." They are also known as followers of "Ahl-al-Bayt" or "People of the Household" (of the Prophet).<br>  <br>  From this initial question of political leadership, some aspects of spiritual life have been affected and now differ between the two groups of Muslims.<br>  <br>  Shia Muslims believe that the Imam is sinless by nature, and that his authority is infallible as it comes directly from God. Therefore, Shia Muslims often venerate the Imams as saints and perform pilgrimages to their tombs and shrines in the hopes of divine intercession. Sunni Muslims counter that there is no basis in Islam for a hereditary privileged class of spiritual leaders, and certainly no basis for the veneration or intercession of saints. Sunni Muslims contend that leadership of the community is not a birthright, but a trust that is earned and which may be given or taken away by the people themselves.<br>  <br>  Shia Muslims also feel animosity towards some of the companions of the Prophet Muhammad, based on their positions and actions during the early years of discord about leadership in the community. Many of these companions (Abu Bakr, Umar, Aisha, etc.) have narrated traditions about the Prophet's life and spiritual practice. Shia Muslims reject these traditions (hadith) and do not base any of their religious practices on the testimony of these individuals. This naturally gives rise to some differences in religious practice between the two groups. These differences touch all detailed aspects of religious life: prayer, fasting, pilgrimage, etc.<br>  <br>  Sunni Muslims make up the majority (85%) of Muslims all over the world. Significant populations of Shia Muslims can be found in Iran and Iraq, and large minority communities in Yemen, Bahrain, Syria, and Lebanon.<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that despite all of these differences in opinion and practice, Shia and Sunni Muslims share the main articles of Islamic belief and are considered by most to be brethren in faith. In fact, most Muslims do not distinguish themselves by claiming membership in any particular group, but prefer to call themselves simply, "Muslims."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Pls follow the following link to read abt issues  b/w Sunni-Shia.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hnn.us/articles/934.html----difference" rel="nofollow">http://hnn.us/articles/934.html----diffe...</a> between shia/sunni<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.islamfortoday.com/shia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamfortoday.com/shia.htm</a>|`|DiDmWPcHaa	conflicts have existed for 1500 years and are not just something that can be overlooked. The fundamental differences date back to approximately 630-650 CE, when the prophet Muhammad died and a successor was elected by the people of Medina. They elected Abu Bakr (father of Muhammads favorite wife)Not every one accepted him as their leader, those who didn't, followed Ali ibn Abi Talib(Muhammadís Son in Law) whom Muhammad named heir. <br>  <br>  Another major difference is the practice of taking a temporary wife or mut'ah allowed by the Shia but long since eradicated by the Sunni...also they have a difference in spiritual leaders, holy days and cities, as well as the practice of taqiya(the act of concealing ones faith for protection and self preservation. although at the core they share the same beliefs. Tension was heightened further but Saddams rule he and other Sunnis oppressed the Shiites for years...As for the Kurds I still can't find out why everyone seems to hate them...They follow another sect of Islam...Sufi I believe.<br>  <br>  Basically there disagreement is much like the fight between different sects of Christianity...for the most part they agree on everything, but are unwilling to accept the little differences that set them apart. Below are two websites that talk about their religious and cultural differences...I hope that this helps you to further understand the longterm animosity between the groups.

Les catholiques, les orthodoxes et la plupart des églises protestantes le célèbrent comme étant à la fois vrai homme et vrai Dieu, deuxième personne de la Sainte Trinité. Il existe d'autres courants chrétiens avec des croyances diverses. Les musulmans le considèrent comme le dernier grand prophète avant Mahomet.

Yes, part was that this was the last day that you could have whatever you were going to give up, but it was not to start partying and getting drunk and such as it is now.<br>  <br>  As Lent started being practiced throughout the whole church in the early 900's, Mardi Gras didn't appear until later. It used to be called Shrove Tuesday and was a time for family to have a feast before fasting the next day and starting the 40 days to Easter. <br>  <br>  Yes, God wants us to have fun, but if you look through the Bible, God wants us to suffer as well. We can have fun as long as we are not committing any mortal sins, which separates us from God. <br>  <br>  This being said, no, I don't think that is the Catholic motto.

E cmq, per rispondere pure alla sottodomanda, non penso che le maschere siano mai una soltanto. Le maschere servono a piacere ad altri, ad evitare complicazioni, a rendere le cose meno agitate, ad ottenere benefici... e questo dipende sempre da chi é colui/colei con cui devi trattare.<br>  é piu semplice essere se stessi, perché sebbene i tira e molla con gli altri sono di piú e pure piu pesanti, il rapporto con te stesso é assolutamente liscio e scorrevole, e questo, semplica molto tante cose.|`|uBv3GQ54aa	Domanda eccellente ma anche difficilissima.   Più ci penso meno so decidermi.  Ci sono tanti pro e tanti contro.  Si, propendo a dire che sia meglio essere se stessi, ma si paga un prezzo troppo alto se si vuol essere sé stessi sempre.   Forse la via migliore riman essere sé stessi solo con i veri amici (sperando di non sbagliare sul loro conto e che l'amicizia duri)  e portare le maschere che più sono adatte in tutti gli altri casi.|`|uzm1QQyhaa	per alcuni portare una maschera è facile,per alcuni psicologi tutti noi abbiamo delle maschere che indossiamo abitualmente per il ruolo e il luogo dove siamo (professionale al lavoro,simpatico e rilassato con gli amici e così via),ma non è detto che questo sia sbagliato.

Ma l'unica cosa è essere sempre se stessi, perchè la maschera così come si indossa con facilità, si può togliere con altrettanta facilità!|`|a0389c2cb76fe65e4263ce5d6bd20d04aa	ciao penso che essere se stessi portare una maschera e facile|`|hvdBFp31aa	portare una maschera, perchè prima o poi ti cade!|`|klG2WQwtaa	La maschera la portiamo tutti fin dalla più tenerà età, E' data dall'educazione, dalle convenzioni sociali, dalle convenienze individuali. Se ce la siamo costruita bene, saremo coerenti senza sforzo.

Te ne penti più in là di aver iniziato ad indossare maschere perchè dopo avere iniziato non si finisce più, è un circolo vizioso. Capisci che le persone ti apprezzano di più se ti avvicini al loro essere e così inizi ad usare una maschera a lavoro, una con gli amici, una con il partner, una a casa e così via fino ad indossare persino una maschera a persona! E' difficile dire: 'io sono così, chi mi vuole mi prenda!' ma si cade nella tentazione di cambiare il proprio essere per piacere agli altri..

However BOTH will grow to the former size of the original and they too will "split" and so on and so forth. That is how the Deities come into being and how they gain in strength and acceptance. Sometimes a split cell, as with NEW deities does not have viability and it will die but the rest wil survive, intact and continue.<br>  <br>  An excellent allegory, Tahuti!<br>  <br>  Brightest Blessings,<br>  Raji the Green Witch|`|WoxA3ilFaa	Often these divisions only makes the religion stronger, I think it's basically how some people like to weed out the bad and out-of-date parts. I don't think it needs to keep splitting but as people change it probably will keep doing so, as to make it suit them. Of course the original will also remain out-of-date parts and all because a lot of people like having it that way it seems to have more value being untouched by time, I mean look at Catholicism it's as old and dusty as it gets.|`|BLnXhWoTaa	my opinion is that everything manifests downward from the source, so for the process to be relevant to us, it must continue to split.  if manifestation stops at the level of polarity, what's the point of the rest of it?|`|xnVTRGmyaa	I don't see it that way myself; allegorically, I think you could use the concept of a candle, which is able to light another candle without losing anything of itself. As long as there is that which allows the flame to continue burning, it will do so--both the original flame, and the one that was lit from it.

8OREBeRdaa	I don't approach women that often because honestly, the majority can be downright b&tchy in their rejections.  When I do, I tend to look for<br>  <br>  - Apperance: She doesn't have to be all 'glammed' up but if she looks like she takes care of herself then that's a good start.<br>  <br>  - Smile: When people smile, it makes them that much more approachable. <br>  <br>  - Look before you Leap: This is merely taking, 10-30 (or less) seconds to assess the situation.  <br>  -I look for rings on the 'wedding finger'.  If she's wearing one then she could be married OR she's wearing a ring because she doesn't want to be flirted with or hit on. It's best to just steer clear of them.<br>  <br>  - What's she doing? If she's fiddling with her keys, looking at a list, texting on her phone, then she probably doesn't want to be bugged at that moment.  Wait a few seconds so that she's less engaged with what she's doing.  I know this sounds like a "playa" tactic but it's not - it's actually just exhibiting some pointed courtesy and ladies tend to be more receptive to potential interruptions.<br>  <br>  - If she's working, then it's how she's interracting with others. If she's pleasant and can carry on a decent conversation then she's more likely to be openminded to starting one up with me. <br>  <br>  - Compliments: This loops back to appearance.  4 out of 5 times I'll tell a girl that I like her hair, her jacket, her dog, whatever. Oh yeah, and these are SINCERE compliments. If she just says "Thanks" and that's it - then so be it.

vYAgIMLdaa	If you feel that you need the contacts for business or social life and can afford it, join.<br>  Personally, I wouldn't join any club that would have ME for a member.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	If you need the social contacts to make business deals, then it may be worth the cost in return business.  If you don't require it, then personally I recommend not wasting the money.  <br>  <br>  Most of these "Private Members" clubs are about establishing social  exclusivity through cash.  It is an old concept established by the dieing aristocracy in the face of equality and democratization of modern countries.  Many of the people who view themselves as "elite" due to their financial condition have picked up this practice to filter out the riff raff.  <br>  <br>  So if you view yourself as socially elite due to your financial condition, then feel free to join the club as it were.  If you need to make the business contacts to prosper, then joining may be a sound financial investment.  Otherwise, if you need a social outlet for social reasons, join a public club which doesn't require an invitation to be a member.  Many museums, playhouses, etc. have open clubs of this nature, and in addition to having club functions, they also perform philanthropic activities with the funds they receive from members.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|GPznIhzMaa	Will the benefits outweigh the cost?

He doesn't love you hon.He wants to fully control you.He probably don't want you going out w/ your friends and he will put an end to it pretty soon. He will cut you off from everyone who cares about you so he has more control over  you. Don't ever put up with another human being who puts his hand on you in any threatening way.

Jehovah’s angel appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying: “Get up, take the young child and its mother and flee into Egypt, and stay there until I give you word; for Herod is about to search for the young child to destroy it.” 14?So he got up and took along the young child and its mother by night and withdrew into Egypt, 15?and he stayed there until the decease of Herod, for that to be fulfilled which was spoken by Jehovah through his prophet, saying: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”<br>  <br>  <br>  (Isaiah 11:1-2) And there must go forth a twig out of the stump of Jes′se; and out of his roots a sprout will be fruitful. <br>  <br>  (Micah 5:2) “And you, O Beth′le?hem Eph′ra?thah, the one too little to get to be among the thousands of Judah, from you there will come out to me the one who is to become ruler in Israel, whose origin is from early times, from the days of time indefinite.<br>  <br>  Things that Jesus could not have planned were these prophecies,being born in Bethlehem,being called out of Egypt when all the children were slaughtered by Herod.Being in the line of Jesse and David he was the sacrificial lamb of God.When the lamb was offered as sacrifice the order was not a bone was to be broken.Jesus died during passover as a sacrificial lamb once and for all times to take away the sin of the world.When the soldiers came to break his legs on the torture stake as was customary he had already died fulfilling the prophecy not a bone of his would be broken.<br>  (Psalm 34:20) He is guarding all the bones of that one; Not one of them has been broken.(John 19:31-36) Then the Jews, since it was Preparation, in order that the bodies might not remain upon the torture stakes on the Sabbath, (for the day of that Sabbath was a great one,) requested Pilate to have their legs broken and the [bodies] taken away. 32?The soldiers came, therefore, and broke the legs of the first [man] and those of the other [man] that had been impaled with him. 33?But on coming to Jesus, as they saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34?Yet one of the soldiers jabbed his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out. 35?And he that has seen [it] has borne witness, and his witness is true, and that man knows he tells true things, in order that YOU also may believe. 36?In fact, these things took place in order for the scripture to be fulfilled: “Not a bone of his will be crushed.”<br>  (Isaiah 53:5) But he was being pierced for our transgression;  The chastisement meant for our peace was upon him, and because of his wounds there has been a healing for us.<br>  <br>  Note the prophecy he would be pierced no others that day were pierced in their sides only he.(Luke 2:34) Also, Sim′e?on blessed them, but said to Mary his mother: “Look!

Then Pilate commanded it to be given over. 59?And Joseph took the body, wrapped it up in clean fine linen, 60?and laid it in his new memorial tomb, which he had quarried in the rock-mass.

349a52849634afa3c0cfcd532c676572aa	Gli storici che elencate-tutti, nessuno escluso- citano i cristiani, e spesso per sentito dire. Non ci vuole molto a capire che c'è una bella differenza. Pensa un pò, c'è chi pensa di aver trovato pure le ossa, o addirittura chi pensa che un cencio- che non risale neanche all'epoca giusta- sia una prova dell'esistenza di quel particolare personaggio (come se non potesse averlo usato un qualsiasi popolano!). <br>  I 4 evangelisti  riportano miracoli diversi tra loro (la resurrezione di un morto è presente solo in due vangeli su 4, e si tratta di due morti diversi!!!). <br>  Come ha già detto qualcuno, uno storico SERIO ammette che il problema è quantomeno controverso.<br>  <br>  Come hanno detto, implicitamente o esplicitamente, molti altri, anche se riuscissi a dimostrare, senza ombra di dubbio, senza falla alcuna, con assoluto rigore, che Gesù NON è esistito, loro continuerebbero a crederci lo stesso. <br>  Dubito che sia esistito. Sono certo che non sia stato figlio di un dio e che non abbia compiuto miracoli. Tanto mi basta|`|1b26177a1416bc520cd9caadaac6a2d1aa	Il fatto che sia esistito, cioè che un uomo con il suo nome abbia effettivamente calpestato questa terra circa 2000 anni fa, è stato storicamente provato.<br>  Che poi abbia fatto quello che sta scritto nei vangeli, per me è alquanto dubbioso.<br>  Dopotutto i vangeli sono stati scritti da degli "adepti" appartenenti alla sua "setta", pertanto ne hanno parlato fin troppo bene, per non dire che quasi sicuramente sono stati loro a divinizzarlo....|`|9rTFZc7raa	oltre al nuovo testamento ed ai testi non canonici, di testimonianze su Gesù ce ne sono poche tra cui alcune dello storico Giuseppe Flavio.|`|MFgzF2ATaa	Gli storici di professioni non hanno alcun interesse particolare nel problema di Gesù, ma sono ben consapevoli che si tratta di un argomento controverso. Uno studioso che afferma di ritenere che il personaggio storico Gesù non sia mai esistito dovrà probabilmente sopportare violenti critiche ed anche l’irrisione, e avrà poco da guadagnare dalle proprie fatiche.<br>  <br>  Pertanto, la maggior parte degli studiosi, nati e cresciuti nell’ambito della cultura cristiana, si accontentano o di presumere che Gesù sia veramente vissuto (in ossequio alle opinioni degli studiosi della Bibbia, il più delle volte uomini di fede); oppure, data la mancanza di indizi su moltissimi grandi personaggi storici, esprimono la loro incertezza adoperando l’avverbio "probabilmente". E’ più prudente affermare la “probabile” esistenza dell’uomo dietro la leggenda, anche quando hanno dimostrato che gli spessi strati di racconti mitologici ci impediscono di sapere qualcosa di certo sul personaggio.<br>  <br>  Nel quadro di questa presa di posizione “prudente” ed imbelle, si afferma “l’incertezza” su un falegname vissuto in villaggio di una lontana provincia in epoca antica (asserendo che "l’assenza di indizi non costituisce un indizio della non-esistenza di Gesù”): ma allo stesso tempo questi scrittori fanno forti del proprio “distacco accademico” rispetto alle “problematiche della fede” che avevano fatto di quello sconosciuto santone una vera e propria icona.|`|b245eb49e8f341e608dae1a86a2259ffaa	leggiti tutti i resoconti degli storici di tutto il mondo , dall'anno  0  all'anno 2ooo  -  mi dispiace per calamaionero , ma forse lui non sa che tutte le affermazioni degli storici, sono state documentate  e che i sudetti storici sono per la maggiorparte  atei o non credenti o di altre religioni|`|dwq1TfbOaa	le stesse prove che tu hai sull'esistenza di altri personaggi famosi nella nostra storia!<br>  Hai le prove che sia esistito gengis-kan? <br>  Nel caso di GESU' io penso che le prove sono veramente tante:<br>  1) studiosi e ricercatori (anche non cristiani) confermano<br>      l'esistenza di Gesu nelle epoche citate dal vangelo.<br>  2) e' nato il Cristianesimo e si e' diffuso nel mondo.<br>  3) 4 evangelisti hanno tutti e 4 confermato al mondo la vita<br>      la morte ed i miracoli di Gesu'.<br>  4) inoltre la prova e' perche' io te lo dico, e ti <br>      garantisco che e' esistito, ed era Dio.<br>    ciao.|`|f5c01b579110f36cafb34fd34643d318aa	oltre ai vangeli, alle epistole paoline e alle altre epistole vi sono testimonianze su Gesù nelle Antichità Giudaiche di Giuseppe Flavio, e in altri scritti dell'epoca, oltre a testimonianze epigrafiche e poi ti sembra logico che se davvero non fosse esistito tutti quegli uomini e donne avessero cominciato a predicare la fede in Lui???<br>  <br>  Modifica<br>  Corretto guerra giudaica con antichità giudaiche, scusate piccolo lapsus<br>  <br>  Vorrei sapere che diavolo mi date i pollici in giù se da storico ho parlato delle fonti storiche?!

Unos 90.000 a?os atrás, una parte de la humanidad de entonces comenzó a albergar esperanzas acerca de una hipotética supervivencia después de la muerte, pero la idea de la posible existencia de algún dios parece que fue aún algo desconocido hasta hace aproximadamente treinta milenios y, en cualquier caso, su imagen, funciones y características fueron las de una mujer todopoderosa. La concepción de un dios masculino creador/controlador —tal como es imaginado aún por la humanidad actual— no comenzó a formalizarse hasta el III milenio a.C. y no pudo implantarse definitivamente hasta el milenio siguiente. <br>  <a href="http://www.pepe-rodriguez.com/dios_mujer..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pepe-rodriguez.com/dios_mujer...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Alrededor de 3.500 a?os antes de Cristo aparecen en los Vedas, libro sagrado de la India, las primeras referencias al dios Mitra. Se le nombra como dios unido a Varuna. Ambos formaban una dualidad inseparable; Mitra era el dios del amanecer, de la luz y del sol; Varuna es el dios del crepúsculo y de la noche. Ambos, luz y oscuridad se encargaban del buen funcionamiento de la bóveda celestial.<br>  Por influencia de los arios hindúes que se trasladaron hacia el actual Irán y Turquía, ya en el a?o 1.400 antes de Cristo, se le nombra como dios garante de un tratado entre los Hititas y el Reino de Mitanni, situado en el actual Kurdistán, a caballo entre Turquía e Irak.<br>  <br>  Alrededor del a?o 1.000 antes de Cristo, nace en Bakctriana, ciudad de Persia— actual Irán— un hombre llamado Zaratustra. Este hombre es considerado por muchos historiadores como el primer ser humano que cambió verdaderamente la Historia y la concepción del mundo y de la persona.<br>  <br>  Zaratustra recibió una “Revelación”, proclamando al verdadero dios, creador del Universo, al que llamó Ahura Mazda que significa “Se?or Sabio”. En oposición a él, estaba Angra Mainyu que significa “Demonio de la Mentira”. Ni qué decir tiene que ambos personificaban el Bien y el Mal. Ambos luchaban por imponerse sobre la Creación y sobre los hombres.<br>  <br>  El Mandeísmo, nombre dado a esta revelación, fue la primera gran religión que tuvo un libro sagrado, el Avesta, que significa “La Palabra”, y su antigüedad es mayor que la Biblia, la cual tomó de este libro algunos de sus pasajes más conocidos.<br>  <br>  Historiadores y filósofos confirman que el Mazdeísmo fue el precursor de las grandes religiones monoteístas basadas en libros sagrados, como el Judaísmo, el Cristianismo y el Islamismo, las cuales beben en sus fuentes originales, los dogmas y ense?anzas de Zaratustra.<br>  <br>  Desgraciadamente, sólo se conserva un tercio del libro original escrito por Zaratustra al dictado de Ahura Mazda, según le iba siendo revelado. Lo más extraordinario, es que Zaratustra tuvo doce discípulos, la tradición persa le otorga la autoría de cientos de milagros y curaciones, incluso la resurrección de varios cadáveres.<br>  <br>  En la religión mazdeísta ya se habla de un diluvio universal, de un arca en la que se salvaron una pareja de animales de cada especie y una familia. Se entroniza una Santísima Trinidad compuesta por los dioses Ahura Mazda, Mitra y la diosa Anahita, esposa de Ahura Mazda y madre de Mitra.<br>  <br>  El Mazdeísmo habla de la primera pareja humana, de Paraíso, del Cielo y del Infierno, del juicio tras la muerte, de la resurrección de los muertos y del juicio final, tras la victoria sobre Angra Mainyu, ayudado por sus demonios, mientras Ahura Mazda y Mitra serán ayudados por los ángeles y arcángeles.<br>  <br>  También anuncia el Avesta, la aparición en La Tierra de un Salvador, un Redentor de la Humanidad, que vendrá a ense?ar a los hombres su misión en la vida y a vencer al mal.<br>  <br>  Este redentor es Mitra, hijo de Ahura Mazda. Según el Avesta, Mitra nació en una gruta el día 25 de diciembre. Una luz resplandeciente situada sobre la gruta despertó a unos pastores que fueron a adorarle. Unos magos, enterados por las estrellas de su nacimiento, fueron a obsequiarle ofrendas. En la gruta, un buey y una mula ayudaban a calentar al ni?o dios. Los mazdeístas creían que Zaratustra era una encarnación del dios Mitra, que había venido a la Tierra para salvar a la Humanidad.<br>  <br>  Mitra, tras su nacimiento, ayunó en el desierto durante cuarenta días y sufrió una “pasión” que se celebraba en la semana del 23 de marzo, con la llegada de la Primavera. Curiosamente es la fecha aproximada en que se celebra la Pasión de Jesucristo.<br>  <br>  Durante dicha pasión, Mitra se veía obligado a matar a un toro, de cuya sangre brotaba toda la Creación.<br>  <br>  Plutarco, habla de los misterios de Mitra en el a?o 87 antes de Cristo, ya que esta religión, la Mitraica, se extendió por todo el Imperio Romano llevada por las legiones que la adoptaron en masa cuando llegaron a Asia Menor. Incluso el emperador Trajano la protegió y declaró el domingo día del sol dedicado a Mitra como día festivo en todo el imperio, más tarde lo adoptó también el cristianismo como día del Se?or.<br>  <br>  La religión Mitraica tenía en su liturgia el bautismo con agua para ingresar en la misma y la confirmación posterior. En la entrada de los mitreos o templos, estaba situada una pila con agua bendecida por los sacerdotes en la cual se mojaba la mano y luego la frente para entrar purificados. Se realizaba una ceremonia o ágape, en el cual se bendecían el pan y el vino o agua, y se repartía entre los asistentes como si fuera la carne y sangre de Mitra de forma simbólica. Se cantaban himnos en honor a Mitra.<br>  <br>  El clero estaba estructurado entre Padres, o sacerdotes comunes, Amtistides u obispos y Pontífices. Sobre todos ellos gobernaba el Padre de los Padres, título equivalente al de Papa.<br>  <br>  Las fechas más se?aladas en el calendario sagrado de Mitra eran: el 25 de diciembre, día del nacimiento del dios; el 6 de enero, día de la adoración de los magos; el 24 de marzo, semana de pasión de Mitra; el 6 de mayo, revelación del Avesta a Zaratustra; el 16 de mayo, comienzo del ayuno de Mitra en el desierto; el 24 de junio, Mitra asciende a los cielos y es proclamado segunda persona de la trinidad; el 16 de agosto, Mitra es nombrado por Ahura Mazda intermediario entre él y los hombres y se le otorga todo el poder sobre la Tierra y sus moradores.<br>  <br>  La religión de Mitra era una religión mistérica, es decir, que guardaba algunas ceremonias en secreto sólo para unos pocos iniciados. Los creyentes en Mitra no eran admitidos de inmediato a todos los secretos de la liturgia ni se le explicaban todas las doctrinas y dogmas. Existían una serie de grados, a través de los cuales iban ascendiendo los fieles según su preparación y la piedad de su vida demostrada ante los sacerdotes y compa?eros de culto.<br>  <br>  La religión de Mitra se extendió por todo el Imperio Romano. El Cristianismo y el Mitraismo convivieron hasta la llegada al poder de Constantino el Grande, el cual, creyente de Mitra, no dudó en aprovechar la ocasión para fusionar ambas doctrinas. El Cristianismo adoptó la estructura del clero mitraico; ya que la Iglesia Primitiva Cristiana no tenía sacerdotes, todos los creyentes eran iguales ante Dios y todos podían tomar la palabra y dirigir las asambleas en donde se recordaban las palabras de Jesús y sólo existían unos encargados de moderar y poner orden entre los asistentes. Luego se nombraron personas entre los más ancianos y respetados, para que administraran los bienes de la congregación y repartieran entre los más pobres las dádivas de los más favorecidos, pero en las primeras iglesias cristianas no existía el clero como tal.<br>  <br>  Constantino convocó el Concilio de Nicea en el siglo IV, y lo presidió aunque no era cristiano. Los obispos o encargados de las iglesias de aquella época, se dejaron embaucar con los regalos y donaciones imperiales, así como con las promesas de nombramientos oficiales, que les equiparaban a los magistrados del imperio.<br>  <br>  De aquél concilio presidido por un no cristiano, el emperador Constantino, nació el Cristianismo tal y como lo conocemos hoy, con Jesús convertido en Dios, segunda persona de la Santísima Trinidad y Redentor de los hombres, la estructura clerical y la mayoría de los dogmas y creencias cristianas.<br>  <br>  A partir de ese momento, el Mitraismo fue perseguido a muerte, sus libros quemados, sus templos derribados, y en pocos a?os, proscrito por edicto imperial de Teodosio. No es extra?o que hoy sea difícil encontrar un libro sobre esta religión que tanto ha “aportado” a nuestra cultura y nuestra forma de vivir.<br>  <br>  No existe ningún original de los Evangelios cristianos canónicos anterior al siglo V. Todos los Evangelios fueron reescritos, interpolados, modificados y adaptados a las nuevas normas eclesiales copiadas del mitraismo. Los Evangelios originales escritos en el siglo I y II, desaparecieron tras la persecución implacable de la jerarquía imperial y eclesiástica. La figura de Jesús fue retocada para hacerla más parecida a Mitra, Dionisos, Adonis, Osiris, Krisna y otros dioses “redentores” de la Humanidad. Todos ellos murieron y resucitaron, algunos de ellos nacieron de una virgen. Adonis por ejemplo resucitaba en Primavera; Krisna estuvo muerto tres días.<br>  <br>  En Egipto se realizaba desde tiempo inmemorial una ceremonia de iniciación, mediante la cual el neófito era atado a una cruz tumbada horizontalmente y depositado en lo más profundo del templo en donde permanecía sin luz, agua ni comida, durante tres días. Al término de su “muerte”, el neófito era sacado a la luz y proclamado nacido de nuevo.<br>  <br>  El Cristianismo “adoptó” las fechas más importantes del mitraismo como suyas, para aprovechar la inercia y la fe de las masas que ya estaban acostumbradas a celebrarlas desde siglos. Sólo se limitaron a cambiar el nombre del dios a honrar.<br>  <br>  Atte.<br>  Halconateo|`|2irhSKMfaa	El que no se hace tantas preguntas!|`|3b40a24e737a92642d7daa0042f8d249aa	El que espera|`|6d165f3e01c6e94d1a82c93713f06becaa	Quieres decir que por el mero hecho de tener esperanza en la vida eterna no puedes ser un corrupto , un cabrón, un ladrón, un asesino , un pedofilo, etc,etc.etc. Por que te diré que yo personalmente conocí a muchos de esos que creen en la vida eterna y como no se arrepientan el borde de la muerte(que es lo que hacen todos estos hipócritas) lo tienen claro.|`|9d603644009cd5ff1d0770a4b71ca926aa	Relacionas temas que son de por sí irrelacionables.

Prima di tutto, soffermiamoci a pensare: Apprezziamo la libertà di scegliere cosa fare e cosa dire, cosa mangiare e cosa indossare, che tipo di lavoro svolgere e dove e come vivere? Oppure vorremmo che qualcuno dettasse ogni nostra parola e azione in ogni momento della vita?<br>  <br>  Nessuna persona normale desidera essere privata della possibilità di decidere della propria vita in modo così completo. Perché no? Per il modo in cui Dio ci ha fatti. La Bibbia ci dice che Dio creò l’uomo a sua ‘immagine e somiglianza’, e una delle facoltà che Dio stesso possiede è la libertà di scelta. (Genesi 1:26; Deuteronomio 7:6) Quando creò gli esseri umani, diede loro questa stessa meravigliosa facoltà: il libero arbitrio. Questa è una ragione per cui troviamo insopportabile essere resi schiavi da governanti oppressivi.<br>  <br>  Quindi il desiderio di libertà non è casuale, poiché Dio è un Dio di libertà. La Bibbia dice: “Dov’è lo spirito di Geova, lì c’è libertà”. (2?Corinti 3:17) Perciò Dio ci ha dato il libero arbitrio. Dal momento che conosceva il meccanismo dei nostri pensieri e dei nostri sentimenti, sapeva che saremmo stati più felici avendo libertà di scelta.<br>  <br>  Insieme al libero arbitrio Dio ci ha dato la capacità di pensare, di soppesare le cose, di prendere decisioni e di distinguere il bene dal male. (Ebrei 5:14) Quindi il libero arbitrio si doveva basare su una scelta intelligente. Non siamo stati fatti come robot privi di intelligenza, senza una volontà propria. E non siamo neanche stati creati per agire d’istinto come gli animali. Piuttosto, il nostro straordinario cervello è stato progettato per operare in armonia con la libertà di scelta.<br>  <br>  Ma Dio si proponeva forse che il libero arbitrio non avesse limiti? Immagina una città piena di attività, senza leggi che regolano il traffico, dove le macchine possono andare in qualsiasi direzione a qualsiasi velocità. Vorresti guidare in quelle condizioni? No, il traffico sarebbe caotico e di sicuro ci sarebbero molti incidenti.<br>  <br>  Lo stesso vale per il dono di Dio del libero arbitrio. Libertà illimitata significherebbe anarchia. Ci devono essere leggi che regolino le attività umane. La Parola di Dio dice: “Siete liberi, ma non vi servite della vostra libertà come di un paravento per il male”. (1?Pietro 2:16, Nuovissima Versione della Bibbia [NVB]) Dio vuole che il libero arbitrio sia regolato per il bene comune. Si proponeva che avessimo non libertà totale, ma libertà relativa, soggetta a certe leggi.<br>  <br>  Leggi che Dio stesso ci diete “Io, Geova, sono il tuo Dio, Colui che ti insegna per il tuo beneficio, Colui che ti fa calcare la via per la quale devi camminare” dice: Isaia 48:17. Allo stesso tempo, entro i loro confini le leggi di Dio consentono grande libertà di scelta.<br>  <br>  Perche` Dio permette le sofferenze?<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/i/20030101/article_01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/i/20030101/art...</a><br>  <br>  Riguardo al fatto che Dio e`  onniscente  non significa che la usi in relazione a ogni cosa che fanno tutte le sue creature.<br>  Ti cito per fare un esempio cio` che dice Rivelazione 22:17 “Chi ode dica: ‘Vieni!’ E chi ha sete venga; chi lo desidera prenda l’acqua della vita gratuitamente”. <br>  Qui fa capire che la scelta non è predestinata; è lasciata all’individuo.<br>  <br>  Ti faccio un'esempio.............Chi possiede una radio può ascoltare le notizie da varie parti del mondo. Ma il fatto che possa sintonizzarsi su una certa stazione non vuol dire che lo faccia. Deve prima accendere la radio e poi scegliere la stazione. In maniera simile, Geova ha la capacità di preconoscere gli avvenimenti, ma la Bibbia mostra che Dio usa questa capacità in modo selettivo e discrezionale, con il dovuto riguardo per il libero arbitrio di cui ha dotato la sua creazione umana.

E per questo motivo, ancora è incompreso.<br>  Dio soffre per tutti i figli che si perdono nel male.<br>  Ha voluto creare uomini liberi altrimenti avrebbe fatto dei robot programmati e Lui stesso non poteva farlo in quanto è Misericordioso e Umile.<br>  <br>  Gesù stesso, sul legno della croce, ha preso su di se l'odio di tutto il mondo.<br>  Solo una donna era ai suoi pedi a compiangerlo e a condividere totalmente i suoi dolori.<br>  Una donna nascosta, di cui si parla con poche citazioni nel Vangelo, proprio perchè rimanesse nascosta, umile.<br>  Ebbene, proprio lì sul legno "scandaloso" della croce, Dio ci ha liberati dai nostri peccati, dal male prendendolo su di se.<br>  A quelli che nel Getsemani gli misero le mani addosso come se fosse un pericoloso terrorista disse:<br>  <<Ogni giorno ero con voi nel tempio e non avete steso le mani contro di me; ma questa è la vostra ora, è l'impero delle tenebre>> (Luca 22:53).<br>  E quando Pietro prese la spada per difenderlo come un  soldato disse: <<Rimetti la spada nel fodero, perché tutti quelli che mettono mano alla spada periranno di spada.<br>  Pensi forse che io non possa pregare il Padre mio, che mi darebbe subito più di dodici legioni di angeli?<br>   Ma come allora si adempirebbero le Scritture, secondo le quali così deve avvenire? >><br>  (Matteo 26:52-54)<br>  <<...non devo forse bere il calice che il Padre mi ha dato?>> (Gv 18,11)<br>  Così Gesù, cioè Dio fattosi uomo, ha voluto soffrire come  nessun uomo ha mai sofferto per amore: calunniato, condannato, schernito, umiliato, torturato, ucciso nudo, schernito e giudicato fino all'ultimo respiro per amore, per amore tuo e di tutti i sofferenti che ci sono nel mondo, facendosi partecipe dei loro dolori.<br>  Questo è il vero volto di Dio.<br>  Lo scandalo della croce diventa vittoria sulla morte e sul peccato.<br>  La vita non finisce con la morte: ce lo ha dimostrato Gesù stesso che dopo tre giorno è risorto dalla morte.<br>  E disse a quelli che lo avevano visto:?Perché siete turbati, e perché sorgono dubbi nel vostro cuore?<br>  Guardate le mie mani e i miei piedi: sono proprio io! Toccatemi e guardate; un fantasma non ha carne e ossa come vedete che io ho!>>(Luca 24,38-39)<br>  <br>  <<Poi disse: ?Sono queste le parole che vi dicevo quando ero ancora con voi: bisogna che si compiano tutte le cose scritte su di me nella Legge di Mosè, nei Profeti e nei Salmi?.<br>  Allora aprì loro la mente all'intelligenza delle Scritture e disse:<br>   ?Così sta scritto: il Cristo dovrà patire e risuscitare dai morti il terzo giorno<br>  e nel suo nome saranno predicati a tutte le genti la conversione e il perdono dei peccati, cominciando da Gerusalemme>><br>  (Luca 24:44-47)<br>  <br>  Molti martiri hanno testimoniato la loro Fede, Speranza e il loro amore in Gesù Cristo subendo le stesse sofferenze, anche prima della venuta sulla terra di Gesù stesso, come puoi leggere qui.<br>  ?è bello morire a causa degli uomini, per attendere da Dio l'adempimento delle speranze di essere da lui di nuovo risuscitati>> (2 Maccabei 7,14) Fu a dirle un giovane che insieme ai 6 fratelli e alla madre morirono furono torturati e uccisi sulla brace vivi per non rinnegare Dio e cedere all'idolatria imposta.<br>  Dopo Gesù la schiera dei martiri e dei santi non si conta. Fino a pochi giorni fa quando dei preti cristiani furono torturati, mutilati e uccisi per non rinnegare la loro Fede, che considerano più preziosa dell'oro.<br>  Anche un giovane prete cattolici in Iraq, prima di essere ammazzato come un criminale, disse le stesse parole dei primi martiri cristiani: "Noi senza la domenica non possiamo vivere" e fu ucciso per la sua Fede.<br>  Gesù ci ha dato un dono prezioso che è la Fede, e per questa Fede il Signore ha sofferto e donato il suo sangue sul legno della croce.<br>  Per amore di Gesù, sperando nella promessa della Resurrezione dei morti, siamo chiamati ad abbandonarci nelle mani del Signore in ogni tempo della nostra vita, specie nell'ultimo momento che può giungere in ogni istante.|`|4DrMd9YVaa	L'uomo ha il libero arbitrio e dalla caduta di Adamo ed Eva il Singore non interviene in questo mondo ma lo farà!!!

Ha senso solo in un universo dove esiste il Bene e il Male, il bianco e il nero.

Bene, ora l'hai dimostrato. è tempo di evolvere. Crescendo, il coraggio bisogna dimostrarlo in modi più adulti, meno facili. Perciò, guarda intensamente negli occhi una persona che soffre e dille "Dio non esiste". Dillo a una prostituta ucraina, dillo a un vucumprà senegalese, dillo a un malato terminale di cancro in un ospedale. Dillo a loro, e cerca di non piangere. Poi torna qui e ripeti che non riacquisterai la fede.

En la región de Kinki los términos Geiko y, para aprendiz de geisha, Maiko han sido usados desde la restauración Meiji. Las geishas fueron bastante comunes en los siglos XVIII y XIX; hoy en día aún existen, pero ha disminuido su número.<br>  Las geishas se originaron como profesionales del entretenimiento; originalmente la mayoría eran hombres. Mientras las cortesanas profesionales brindaban entretenimiento sexual, las geishas usaban sus habilidades en distintas artes japonesas, música, baile, y narración. Las geishas de ciudad (machi) trabajaban independientemente en fiestas fuera de los "barrios de placer", mientras que las de barrio (kuruwa) lo hacían dentro de estos. Al declinar el nivel artístico de las cortesanas, las geishas, hombres y mujeres, tuvieron mayor demanda.<br>  Los geisha masculinos (algunas veces conocidos como hōkan) comenzaron a declinar, y para 1800 las geishas femeninas (conocidas originalmente como onna geisha, literalmente geisha mujer) los superaron en número de tres a uno, y el término "geisha" comenzó a usarse para referirse a las mujeres con habilidades para el entretenimiento, como hoy en día.<br>  Tradicionalmente, las geishas comenzaban su entrenamiento a una corta edad. Algunas jóvenes eran vendidas a las casas de geishas en su ni?ez, y comenzaban su entrenamiento en varias artes tradicionales casi inmediatamente.<br>  Durante su ni?ez, las geishas a veces trabajaban como criadas o asistentes de las más experimentadas, y luego como aprendices de geisha (maiko) durante su entrenamiento. Esta tradición de entrenamiento existe en otras disciplinas de Japón, el estudiante deja su hogar, comienza a hacer trabajos hogare?os y asistir a su maestro, para eventualmente convertirse en uno.<br>  Aún existe cierta confusión, especialmente fuera de Japón, sobre la naturaleza de la profesión de las geishas. Este tema se ha complicado debido a las prostitutas japonesas, particularmente en onsen, que quieren ligarse al prestigio de las geishas promocionándose a los turistas (japoneses y extranjeros) como "geishas".<br>  Tradicionalmente, la geisha debe mantenerse soltera (o retirarse luego de su matrimonio), aunque no es poco común que tengan hijos. Mientras que los compromisos generalmente incluyen coquetear e incluso bromas sugerentes (no obstante codificados en maneras tradicionales), nunca incluyen actividad sexual, y una geisha no es pagada por sexo, aunque algunas pueden elegir tener una relación que incluya el sexo con algún cliente fuera de su rol como tal. Y debido a que estas relaciones están vinculadas con la capacidad del cliente de pagar por los servicios tradicionales, el argumento puede ser que es simplemente una forma complicada de prostitución.<br>  Fue tradicional para las geishas tener un danna, o cliente habitual. Un danna era generalmente un hombre adinerado, algunas veces casado, que tenía recursos para financiar los costos del entrenamiento tradicional de la geisha y otros gastos considerables, teniendo derechos especiales (no solo físicos). Esto ocurre a veces en la actualidad.<br>  Aunque una geisha y su danna podrían estar enamorados, la relación está sujeta a la capacidad del danna de entregar algún aporte financiero. Los valores y convenios ligados a este tipo de relaciones no son bien comprendidas, incluso entre los japoneses.<br>  Se especula sobre la venta de la virginidad de las geishas y de su cuerpo a un solo cliente (hasta que el danna se cansara y entonces se buscaría otro), algo que era usual. La publicación de la novela "Memorias de una geisha" generó gran polémica sobre este tema, normalmente acallado y negado por la novela y escritores románticos.|`|bOpPxbeqaa	son damas de compa?ia pero servicio "completo"<br>  <br>  jajajajajaja tu me entiendes chamo xD|`|babff67c7eb8e3d878d5feef2c8af8f7aa	asi es son p..... pero la palabra es en japones ( o chino una de dos ) pero si si lo son|`|ddfbea293e9581a80c3c5f7eebb88348aa	Supongo que tiene que ver con una cultura donde la mujer ha estado siempre al servicio del hombre.

Se dedicaban a ofrecer su compa?ía a los hombres, pero nunca se acostaban con ellos, ya que era una norma el que siempre estuvieran acompa?adas de un chaperon o de su "hermana" mayor, algo asi como su madrina y/o maestra.

EYqTV2EYaa	To 2ool: As for women being men's sex objects, I disagree because we're individuals. When people, not just women, have sex, they do so for their own benefits whether for romance, hedonistic reasons, money, or anything. See, if females WERE sex objects, women can say the same thing about men because they ALLOW the men to have sex with them. If that weren't case, think, we wouldn't be sex objects because you wouldn't have anything to have sex with, and in general, when a woman DOES choose to have sex, it's usually for the pleasure of both people, not just yours. As an individual, a woman can choose to be a sex object, but she doesn't speak for all. <br>  <br>  I noticed you said 'women can be half-naked.' Well, I agree because we have the right, but in society, when is this the case? As far as I'm concerned, in THIS society, if a woman is half-naked other than being at the beach or in her home, she is a 'slut,' something I highly disagree with. Honestly, I think you're confused with how things are perceived in a society standpoint, and gender standpoint. Society wants ALL people to keep their clothes on, however, with exceptions to certain areas, such as beaches, public nudity facilities, and so on. For example, in society's case, I personally wear my bra and panties in my house, which is what I'm wearing now, and sometimes if the weather is well, I check the mail and get the paper every morning wearing this and some slippers. Oftentimes, the older (usually female) neighbors complain if they're sitting out, so I put on my bathrobe more. If I did that in a nude society however, if would have been okay. That's society for you. <br>  <br>  Yet, in a gender standpoint, it's mostly sexual. Thenceforth, generally (though not always) heterosexual individuals, naturally prefer the bodies of the other sex. For instance, a straight girl in general would love to see another man's body, for seeing how that's the gender she's attracted to, she has natural preferences of what is needed to for her to BE attracted to him. Therefore, as a result, women generally like muscular men. If a girl doesn't like a man's body, she may either be influenced by society (which is what I believe about the old lady I mentioned,) have her own personal preferences, or is not heterosexual.  <br>  <br>  As for men, well, it's the same thing, just 'vice-versa.' Because they have preferences, they prefer women with nice bodies and less clothing so they can see more it. Also remember these views are SEXUAL views, not normal because trust me, men generally don't mind seeing another guy nude when it is NON-sexual because many play sports and change all their clothes together, look at porn with men having sex with a woman, and etc. To explain women, I'll use myself as an example. I don't mind seeing the female body nude because trust me, as a cheerleader, I have been in the shower with other girls, and to me, it's normal. However, on the sexual side, I do not like seeing the female body nude because it is a turn-off, for I see nothing in my case, sexual on her body, thus, unneeded for me to be attracted. Though theoretical, I believe it's like that for many other females too.  <br>  <br>  As for what you mentioned about men taking their clothing off, I believe the girls that complain by saying, 'ew, put your shirt back on' are either lesbians, or the guy subjectively has a body they find disgusting. In my area, the guys take off their shirts quite often when they play basketball, or when I was in high school, in PE class. The girls always seemed to be relatively . . . happy for lack of a better word, because 'aroused' would be too far. I mean, at least one girl in the building mentions their abs when they take off their shirts. As for the guys, they generally don't care because usually when one guy has their shirts off, a few more would as well. However, girls, even if they're in bras, can't even take off their shirts or they'd be seen as sluts. In my opinion, I say that's unfair double-standard, and I don't believe in 'slutty' behavior. Also, you need to have consideration. Simply because you don't see the male disgusting doesn't mean other people should have your same opinion. Also remember opinions are not facts. Sure enough, I agree with you, nothing is disgusting about the male body in general, as I find it arousing, but as the basics are, people are different. People need to accept that.|`|ed7d52fe8334c4d034acc2f4c34f0b44aa	In the basic scheme of things, men are  (generally)voyeurs and women  (generally) exhibitionists|`|eYwzlsk4aa	Oh, I know, right?

Pero sin menospreciar a las personas que creen en Buda, etc. Aunque pienso que cuando se adora a un Dios, al final siempre será el mismo, un Dios de Amor, ya que si hacer bien, quieres al prójimo como a tí mismo, es lo más importante. De nada vale que profeses una religión como el Catolicismo. el Cristianismo, el Budismo, etc y seas mala persona.

E’ un amore capace di generosità, a somiglianza dell’amore di Dio; si vuol bene all’altro perché lo si riconosce degno di essere amato. è un amore che genera la comunione tra persone, poiché ciascuno considera il bene dell’altro come proprio. è un dono di sé fatto a colui che si ama, in cui si scopre, si attua la propria bontà nella comunione di persone e s’impara il valore di essere amato e di amare”<br>  <br>  Quindi non è il sesso in sè ad essere considerato impuro, ma il sesso in quanto fine a se stesso, il che è tutta un'altra cosa....<br>  <br>  Spero arrivi qualcuno di più esperto a spiegare meglio questo punto...|`|dl064mR3aa	perche' loro non lo possono fare!ma hanno un sacco di figli al mondo!|`|kU0GFU0Iaa	E' considerato cosi' da persone che poi stuprano i bambini...|`|og8rQPwJaa	solo per i cristiani e derivati.|`|uvWDEca9aa	Nella Bibbia non è scritto da nessuna parte che il sesso è un atto impuro e nemmeno che si deve fare solo per procreare!!<br>  Il sesso è un dono di Dio ma va fatto solo nell'ambito matrimoniale.

Se lo si fa al di fuori allora è impurità.|`|GAnFRxDAaa	Nella bibbia è considerato impuro il sesso prima del matrimonio con persone dello stesso sesso e con chi non è il tuo coniuge...ma il sesso nel ambito del matrimonio è sacro è un vincolo di unione duraturo...poi l'uomo ha deformato questa cosa andando agli estremi di tutto...|`|SRmwl77Raa	Questa affermazione non è corretta...<br>  Il sesso è un atto impuro se fatto ''gratuitamente'' senza sentimento ma solo come coronamento di una notte di esagerazione di alcol.....<br>  Diventa invece un atto puro e solenne qualora fatto in un contesto di amore e rispetto.|`|7733c4c608f8030b21dd1c6e1d384fa0aa	Ovviamente quando il sesso è privo della componente affettiva è un atto non impuro ma non d'amore , diciamo meccanico , che serve solo a soddisfare certe voglie, che sono insite nell'uomo/donna a livello istintivo. Era considerato un atto impuro per una serie di motivi , non ultimo e meno importante quello del profilo della salute e dell'igiene. Oggi il sesso è complementare alla vita di coppia . E a mio avviso fare all'amore , che è diverso da fare sesso, è una pratica che serve alla coppia per essere più intimi e conoscersi meglio e più in profondità.|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	é impuro solo se non é a fini di procreare...

(Romanos 1:20.) Se vio su amor al crear la Tierra perfectamente ajustada a las necesidades del hombre. Jehová creó una esposa perfecta para el hombre, a fin de que fuera su compa?era y la madre de sus hijos. Colocó a ambos en un hermoso jardín y les dio en abundancia todo lo que necesitaban para vivir y ser felices. Sobre todo, les dio la maravillosa oportunidad de vivir por siempre. (Génesis 2:7-9, 15-24.)<br>  <br>  La sabiduría de Dios se vio al probar a la primera pareja humana. Para seguir perteneciendo a la familia universal de Jehová y para que pudieran vivir por siempre como padres de la raza humana, tenían que ser ejemplos de fidelidad y de adoración verdadera. Así, Jehová les dio la oportunidad de demostrar su condición de corazón en una prueba apropiada: no?debían comer del árbol del conocimiento de lo bueno y lo malo. Fue muy sabio el que Jehová permitiera al ser humano demostrar su obediencia y amor a él antes de darle los maravillosos privilegios que le tenía preparados.<br>  <br>  Se vio la justicia de Dios al sostener sus elevadas normas ante sus criaturas y no?transigir. Se vio al dar a Adán y Eva la oportunidad de hacer lo correcto. Y cuando no?lo hicieron, se vio su justicia al sentenciarlos a sufrir la pena declarada por su rebelión.<br>  <br>  El poder de Jehová se vio al ejecutar su sentencia. Satanás, el gran rebelde, había insinuado que Jehová era mentiroso, y le ofreció mucho a Eva si desobedecía a Dios. (Génesis 3:1-7.) Pero Satanás no?pudo cumplir lo que prometió. No?pudo impedir que Jehová expulsara a Adán y Eva del jardín de Edén, y tampoco el cumplimiento de lo que Dios le dijo a Adán: “Polvo eres y a polvo volverás”. (Génesis 3:19.) Sin embargo, Jehová no?ejecutó la pena de muerte inmediatamente, con lo que volvió a demostrar su amor. Permitió tiempo a Adán y Eva para que tuvieran hijos y de este modo llegara a cumplirse su propósito original para la humanidad. (Génesis 1:28.)<br>  <br>  Finalmente, la justicia, el amor, el poder y la sabiduría de Jehová Dios se manifestaron en su promesa de proveer una descendencia que destruiría las obras de Satanás y repararía los tristes resultados de la primera rebelión contra la soberanía divina. (Génesis 3:15.) ?Qué maravilloso Creador tenemos!<br>  <br>  ESTA MAL ESTA REFLEXION?|`|lR3jrIIvaa	El estar vivo y que haya cosas buenas de forma<br>  figurativa en el mundo...<br>  no esta de más creer en dios...<br>  <br>  PAZ|`|yJM0JpWSaa	La verdadera razón creo yo que es por que tienen miedo a morir y desaparecer, así, nadamás.

Hay veces que nosotros mismos somos los que nos condenamos por nuestras propias creencias, opiniones y pensamientos.<br>  En cuanto a ser ateo, entiendo que aun no has vivido alguna experiencia que te haya puesto en contacto directo con Dios.  Una vez que la vivas, dejaras de no creer.<br>  Yo vivi mi experiencia a los 18 a?os.  Mi papa estaba enfermo, no se sabia lo que tenia, le hicieron una cirugia exploratoria aver que era...resulto cancer pancreatico, inoperable, tan grande era el tumor que le rodeaba el pancreas completito, y era un tumor bien duro, dificil de tratar de sacar.  Lo cerraron, pero se puso tan debil en la operacion (tenia 75) que iba amorir esa misma noche.  Mi madre me recibe ami y a mi hermana de la universidad con esa noticia.  Se me cayo el mundo...como mi papito podi morirse hoy mismo (estaba inconsciente) si los sintomas que tenia eran como de indigestion? Cancer? Como? Eso no le podia estar pasando a mi papa y menos a mi.  Lo fuimos a ver a intensivo y no contenerme y me eche a llorar, por mas que mami me dijo que fuera fuerte.  EL doctor dijo que esperaramos la llamada.  Cuando llegamos a casa, me fui a mi cuarto y hice lo que nunca habia hecho,rezar como nunca antes, me arrodille, en la oscuridad de mi cuarto y cerre los ojos.  Rece y le pedi a Dios que me dejara a mi papa por lo menos hasta Navidad (era septiembre), no se cuanto tiempo paso, para mi fueron horas (fueron solo 5 minutos) pero me senti como en otra parte flotando mientras rezaba, pero no me importo, segui rezando por mi papa.  Al otro dia nos llama el doctor de que habia despertado y pedia comida y vernos.  Duro hasta enero del otro a?o (4 meses mas).  Dios me cumplio mi deseo, paso la Navidad conmigo, vio el arbolito y en enero 22 del 1985 murio en paz.<br>  Esa es mi experiencia y por eso creo en Dios a quien le reze tanto ese dia.  No soy fanatica ni voy todos los domingos a la Iglesia, pero se que hay un Dios que me complace cuando le pido y al que le agradezco los mejores 4 meses que pase con mi papa.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Tu como todos tenemos derecho de creer o no creer en Dios. Solo debemos es de ser tolerantes y respetuosos unos con otros. Nadie es mejor que el otro por creer o no creer en Dios. Al hombre lo hace sus experiencias y comportamiento de vida y su amor por ellos mismos y con los demás. Sobre todo tener valores humanos y morales. Si tu tienes eso.

Si dices que un ateo sufre de discriminación en un círculo de creyentes también un creyente sufre de discriminación en un círculo de ateos, por el simple hecho de ser minoría. Y esto de que ser ateo es una blasfemia y que "vas a sufrir" no le veo la lógica, las creencias y no-creencias son algo tan personal que mientras no influyan en tu trabajo por ejemplo no tienen porque afectar en nada. Claro que si te pones a gritar por todos lados "soy ateo" cuando no viene al caso la gente te va a ver raro, si estás cenando con tu familia y alguien dice "gracias a Dios" y tu le dices que Dios no existe vas a recibir agresiones porque tu estás agrediendo. Si quieren que vayas a misa, ya es otra cosa, puedes decir con toda libertad "yo no creo" porque ya estás bastante grandecito como para quedarte callado

Glielo ho detto, e lui lo riconosce… Fa credere che l’inferno non c’è, che il peccato non esiste ma è solo un’esperienza in più da fare. Concupiscenza, successo e potere sono le tre grandi passioni su cui Satana insiste. <br>  <br>  Quanti casi di possessione demoniaca ha incontrato? <br>  AMORTH: Dopo i primi cento ho smesso di contarli. <br>  <br>  Cento? Ma sono tantissimi. Lei nei suoi libri dice che i casi di possessione sono rari. <br>  AMORTH: E lo sono davvero. Molti esorcisti hanno incontrato solo casi di mali diabolici. Ma io ho ereditato la “clientela” di un esorcista famoso come padre  Candido, e quindi i casi che lui non aveva ancora risolto. Inoltre, gli altri esorcisti mandano da me i casi più resistenti. <br>  <br>  Il caso più difficile che ha incontrato? <br>  AMORTH: Ce l’ho “in cura” adesso, e da due anni. è la stessa ragazza che è stata benedetta ? non è stato un vero esorcismo ? dal Papa a ottobre in Vaticano e  che ha creato scalpore sui giornali. è colpita 24 ore su 24, con tormenti indicibili. I medici e gli psichiatri non riuscivano a capirci nulla. è pienamente lucida e intelligentissima. Un caso davvero doloroso.  <br>  <br>  Come si cade vittime del demonio? <br>  AMORTH: Si può incappare nei mali straordinari inviati dal demonio per quattro motivi. O perché questo costituisce un bene per la persona (è il caso di molti santi), o per la persistenza nel peccato in modo irreversibile, o per un maleficio che qualcuno lancia per mezzo del demonio, o quando ci si dedica a pratiche di occultismo. <br>  <br>  Durante l’esorcismo di posseduti, che tipo di fenomeni si manifestano? <br>  AMORTH: Ricordo un contadino analfabeta che durante l’esorcismo mi parlava solo in inglese, e io avevo bisogno di un interprete. C’è chi mostra una forza sovrumana, chi si solleva completamente da terra e varie persone non riescono a tenerlo seduto sulla poltrona. Ma è solo per il contesto in cui si svolgono, che parliamo di presenza demoniaca. <br>  <br>  A lei il demonio non ha mai fatto del male? <br>  AMORTH: Quando il cardinale Poletti mi chiese di fare l’esorcista io mi raccomandai alla Madonna: "Avvolgimi nel tuo manto e io sarò sicurissimo". Di minacce il demonio me ne ha fatte tante, ma non mi ha mai fatto nessun danno. <br>  <br>  Lei non ha mai paura del demonio? <br>  AMORTH: Io paura di quella bestia? è lui che deve avere paura di me: io opero in nome del Signore del mondo. E lui è solo la scimmia di Dio. <br>  <br>  Padre Amorth, il satanismo si diffonde sempre di più. Il nuovo Rituale rende difficile fare esorcismi. Agli esorcisti si impedisce di partecipare a una udienza con il Papa a piazza San Pietro. Mi dica sinceramente: cosa sta accadendo? <br>  AMORTH: Il fumo di Satana entra dappertutto. Dappertutto! Forse siamo stati esclusi dall’udienza del Papa perché avevano paura che tanti esorcisti riuscissero a cacciare via le legioni di demoni che si sono insediate in Vaticano.  <br>  <br>  Sta scherzando, vero? <br>  AMORTH: Può sembrare una battuta, ma io credo che non lo sia. Non ho nessun dubbio che il demonio tenti soprattutto i vertici della Chiesa, come tenta tutti i  vertici, quelli politici e quelli industriali.  <br>  <br>  Sta dicendo che anche qui, come in ogni guerra, Satana vuole conquistare i generali avversari?  <br>  AMORTH: è una strategia vincente. Si tenta sempre di attuarla. Soprattutto quando le difese dell’avversario sono deboli. E anche Satana ci prova. Ma grazie al  cielo c’è lo Spirito Santo che regge la Chiesa: "Le porte dell’inferno non prevarranno". Nonostante le defezioni. E nonostante i tradimenti. Che non devono  meravigliare. Il primo traditore fu uno degli apostoli più vicini a Gesù: Giuda Iscariota. Però nonostante questo la Chiesa continua nel suo cammino. è tenuta in piedi dallo Spirito Santo e quindi tutte le lotte di Satana possono avere solo dei risultati parziali. Certo, il demonio può vincere delle battaglie. Anche importanti. Ma mai la guerra.<br>  “Padre, perdona loro, perché non sanno quello che fanno “. (Lc.

IwiLJuGUaa	Las religiones  Son creadas, cultuadas, seguidas por seres humanos (personas) por lo que si estas despreciaran a las personas es solo que el ser humano se desprecia a si mismo.<br>   La Fe no discrimina.<br>   Los angeles, seres de luz. Santos, Dioses, O como los quieras denominar no discriminan.<br>   Las personas y sus dogamas erran y discriminan a tood el que no piense, diga y actua como creen debe hacerlo|`|10e4db976b6f1dfc1d0e6527ae64d6e5aa	si... bueno... las personas que estan dentro de ciertas religiones|`|1Cl2PL3laa	es el ser humano que en su imperfección creó tantas religiones porque hizo las diferencias, Dios no hace las diferencias, solo los seres pensamos distinto y hacemos grupos o nos aislamos.

El día que seamos capaces de dejar nuestros egoísmos de lado, no harán falta tantas religiones, el abrazo, el beso, la mirada, la mano extendida a nuestro hermano. eso bastará para que alcancemos la felicidad.|`|21sNdz7Taa	Tienes toda la razón.<br>  Parecen multinacionales... no todas|`|ExMpI6BRaa	Las religiones son dogmatica, por ende las pesonas que expresan su desacuerdo abiertamente no son bien vistas por éstas, sin embargo el religioso trata de convencer a los no creyentes de que están en un error. El desprecio es relativo, como las religiones se componen de grupos de personas, es lógico que no piensen igual y no actuan igual.|`|UqH8zQiXaa	la gente hace las religiones a su gusto y asu conveniencia.... y hacemos a dios a nuestro gusto... no  nos hacemos al gusto de dios como deveria ser.---|`|XLqfreGVaa	Las diferentes religiones buscan adeptos que convengan al grupo por lo tanto siempre van buscando el beneficio ya sea economico o estatus social.<br>  No estoy de acuerdo en que la fe sea canalizada como un rubro , ya que debe ser una forma de vida que se dirige con los valores morales de un ser humano que razona.|`|esDGPCqpaa	Si, la mayoría son una especie de club en el que solo cierta gente puede pertenecer, así que se puede decir que "desprecian a las personas"<br>  <br>  Pero el hombre no desprecia la religión, si no que por culpa de las religiones desprecia a Dios.|`|dcSxwkqraa	Las religiones fueron creadas por personas de buena fe que querían que las personas se guiasen por un fin común para facilitar la convivencia.<br>  Luego llegaron otras personas que supieron ver el potencial de tener a las masas controladas a través de preceptos, mandatos que si se contradecían incurrirían en el castigo divino.<br>  Son estos aprovechados los que han provocado que las religiones degraden a las personas.<br>  Si conseguimos ver la esencia pura de todas las religiones, en la mayoría de los casos (no las conozco todas) solo son pautas de comportamiento pacífico entre los pueblos.|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Es alrreves, el hombre es el que desprecia a las personas y no las religiones. No importa de que religión se sea o se profese ni de que sea ateo o agnóstico. ES LA MANO DEL HOMBRE QUIEN DESPRECIA A LOS DEMáS, sin darse cuenta que si desprecia a otro, ahí está despreciando también a Dios y a Jesús.<br>  <br>  Amaos a los otros como a ti mismo. Aquel que despreciéis a otros también me desprecia a mí y a mi padre.|`|kyfjpl95aa	Pues eso es raro, porque las religiones fueron creadas por el hombre con fines económicos y de poder,,,,,,,, saludos|`|6be3b9abc18945cf66b3d80575333092aa	Es obvio que el ser humano teme a lo que es raor oque le causa desconfianza.<br>  Durante eones, la humanidad se ha exterminado solo por la única razón de pensar diferentes.<br>  Recuerda que hubo personas que siendo reyes o líderes (religiosos, militares y civiles) aniquilaron poblaciones entera tan solo por pensar diferente.<br>  Quieres una muestra actual.<br>  No se trata de religión, pero la forma de pensamiento diferente a la que tiene Chavez, Castro y el de Norcorea le ha costado la vida a muchas personas.<br>  Antes a opositores de Pinochet, Hitler, Echeverria, Hiroito, Mao, etc.<br>  Estos son ejemplos de la época posterior a que la iglesia cediera ante la milicia.<br>  Pero antes de eso:<br>  Las persecuciones de cristianos, protestantes, indios, musulmanes, blancos, ****** y morenos.<br>  El esclavismo y el sometimiento, el aparteid, el racismo.<br>  No son las religiones..., somos los seres humanos.<br>  Lo siento. chao.|`|CAikB0MBaa	Las religiones se han inventado por el hombre y par el hombre. El desprecio es un sentimiento humano, pero too lo que tocamos se convierte en lo mismo, no por todos si no por los que son capaces de tener una fe ciega y prohibir, y dictar normas de conducta, que por mucho que se crea y lea siempre se incumplen. La intolerancia, el racismo, las guerras, las violaciones a los pensamientos distintos, y el constante bombardeo de cuentos que par unos son historia, eso es lo que fomenta el desprecio, la religión, la política, y todo lo que pueda controlar, y a su vez mandar. Lo siento pero por mucho que creas en algo, no te va a hacer diferente de lo que eres, y aun menos salvarte de nada.|`|cQTuUaQFaa	Las religiones monoteístas deprecian completamente a las personas.<br>  <br>  ?Por qué?<br>  - Porque despojan al ser humano de la libertad de conciencia.<br>  - Porque convierten al ser humano en un autómata, en un fanático con ideas fijas.<br>  - Porque condenan el cuerpo, el sexo y todos los placeres mundanos.<br>  - Porque desprecian esta vida y este mundo. Para estas religiones este mundo es sólo un "lugar de paso", un campo de pruebas donde se decide el destino del hombre en el más allá. Son en el fondo religiones nihilistas.|`|d81ae76614e188ba948d492d99552663aa	Los ateos son los que desprecian las religiones.

Bueno, para eso no necesitas a ningún dios, simplemente tener una conducta moral bien sustentada en un humanismo medianamente meditado.<br>  <br>  ?Libre albedrío significará para dios el abandono total de sus criaturas a su suerte, a los azares de la naturaleza, la enfermedad a personas buenas, inocentes?<br>  <br>  Si me presionas, quizá acepte que tu dios es culpable de indiferencia, la más patética y desgraciada actitud que puedes tener para con alguien, sobre todo cuando dices que lo amas.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|2636c9f88baa2c94bde5d6e6e7f1eb8eaa	Es una posición muy cómoda, como Dios no baja de las nubes envuelto en luz a detener el mal entonces o es malo o no existe; describen cosas horribles culpando a Dios por su "indiferencia" y no se dan cuenta de que si la persona que realizó estas acciones hubiera tenido un mínimo de amor hacia su prójimo no lo hubiera hecho, hablan de catastrofes naturales inevitables y no se dan cuenta de que lo realmente valioso es que tenemos la capacidad de ayudarnos unos a otros a salir adelante. Parte de la salvación que trajo Cristo consistió en darnos las herramientas y las formas para salvarnos, y no solo del infierno después de la muerte, si no del infierno en la propia tierra. Me parece extremadamente egoista lavar las culpas y la indiferencia propia echándole la culpa a Dios y no tener ni la más mínima disposición para hacer algo nosotros|`|462410aca33c137f7676b925b3385428aa	Muy buena tu pregunta, y es cierto muchas personas no son capaces de pensar que toda la culpa la lleva el hombre, que si el dejó pasar el mal en el mundo es su obligación moral ahora depurarlo, cada uno de nosotros debemos cambiar nuestro corazón, para que eso suceda, al menos de eso tengo esperanza. saludos.

Es decir, hay que "caminar". Nadie puede decir que tiene la verdad, porque la verdad la tiene el Mesías Yeshúa. Pero sí se puede buscarla, puesto que también dice la Biblia que el que busca, halla.<br>  También la Biblia nos exhorta a examinar continuamente en qué creemos. 1Timoteo 4:16 dice: " Ten cuidado de ti mismo y de la doctrina;  persiste en ello,  pues haciendo esto,  te salvarás a ti mismo y a los que te oyeren". <br>  2 Juan 9 dice: "Cualquiera que se extravía,  y no persevera en la doctrina de Cristo,  no tiene a Dios;  el que persevera en la doctrina de Cristo,  ése sí tiene al Padre y al Hijo" <br>  Estos textos hablan de cuidarse a uno mismo, y perseverar; acciones que denotan una continuidad en el tiempo. La búsqueda de la verdad está viva; quien diga que ya llegó a ella, mata esta búsqueda, y se enga?a a sí mismo.<br>  Recuerde que relata el libro de Hechos, que unos judíos de Berea recibieron la predicación de Pablo:<br>  Hechos 17:10-12 : "Inmediatamente,  los hermanos enviaron de noche a Pablo y a Silas hasta Berea.  Y ellos,  habiendo llegado,  entraron en la sinagoga de los judíos. Y éstos eran más nobles que los que estaban en Tesalónica,  pues recibieron la palabra con toda solicitud,  escudri?ando cada día las Escrituras para ver si estas cosas eran así. Así que creyeron muchos de ellos,  y mujeres griegas de distinción,  y no pocos hombres".<br>  Si los judíos de Berea se hubiesen quedado en la postura de "yo ya tengo la verdad", nunca hubieran recibido el mensaje del Mesías que Pablo les traía. E incluso cuando escucharon el mensaje, lo confrontaron con la Escritura.<br>  Lo mismo debemos hacer nosotros. No podemos creer cualquier cosa, por más que lo diga el pastor, el cura o el rabino. Nosotros somos responsables delante de Dios por nuestra propia vida.|`|JIWuWKUCaa	Los Catolicos y cristianos, no aman a NADIE sino las guerras existirian o a vuestro criterio no existirian.<br>  Los dias pares soy Ateo y los dias impares Agnostico, y estoy muy feliz por que no tengo que mentir diciendo Yo no fui, cuando realmente fui.

Finalmente hubo tempestades, terremotos, tormentas violentas y gran destrucción como se?al de la muerte de Cristo. Los capítulos del 11 al 28 son un registro de la visita de Cristo a las Américas, lo cual comprende la parte central del libro de Tercer Nefi. Muchas de las palabras de Cristo son similares a sus sermones que se encuentran registrados en la Biblia (por ejemplo, Mateo 5 al 7 y 3 Ne. 12 al 14).

(Gé 1:26, 27; Pr 8:30, 31; compárese con Jn 1:1-3; Col 1:15-17.) Nótese que las Escrituras no dicen que Dios creó al hombre a la imagen de una bestia salvaje o de un animal doméstico o de un pez. Se hizo al hombre ‘a la imagen de Dios’; era un “hijo de Dios”. (Lu 3:38.) En cuanto a la forma o aspecto del cuerpo de Dios, “nadie ha contemplado a Dios nunca”. (1Jn 4:12.) Nadie en la Tierra conoce la apariencia del cuerpo de Dios, que es glorioso, celestial y espiritual; por lo tanto, no podemos comparar el cuerpo del hombre con el de Dios. “Dios es un Espíritu.” (Jn 4:24.)<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, el hombre fue hecho a ‘la imagen de Dios’ en el sentido de que fue creado con cualidades morales como las de él, a saber, amor y justicia. (Compárese con Col 3:10.) También tiene facultades y sabiduría superiores a las de los animales, de manera que puede apreciar aquello que Dios aprecia y valora, como la belleza y las artes, el habla y el raciocinio, así como otros procesos similares de la mente y el corazón. Además, el hombre tiene capacidad espiritual y puede llegar a conocer a Dios y comunicarse con él. (1Co 2:11-16; Heb 12:9.) Por tales razones el hombre estaba capacitado para ser el representante de Dios y tener en sujeción a las criaturas voladoras, terrestres y marinas.<br>  <br>  Por ser una creación de Dios, el hombre originalmente era perfecto. (Dt 32:4.) Por consiguiente, Adán pudo haber legado a su posteridad la perfección humana y la oportunidad de vivir para siempre en la Tierra. (Isa 45:18.) A él y a Eva se les ordenó: “Sean fructíferos y háganse muchos y llenen la tierra y sojúzguenla”. A medida que su familia hubiese ido aumentando, habrían cultivado y embellecido la Tierra de acuerdo con el proyecto de su Creador. (Gé 1:28.)<br>  <br>  Cuando el apóstol Pablo escribió sobre las posiciones relativas que Dios dispuso para el hombre y la mujer, dijo: “Quiero que sepan que la cabeza de todo varón es el Cristo; a su vez, la cabeza de la mujer es el varón; a su vez, la cabeza del Cristo es Dios”. Luego indicó que una mujer que ora o profetiza en la congregación con la cabeza descubierta avergüenza al que es su cabeza. Para reforzar su argumento, a?adió: “Porque el varón no debe tener cubierta la cabeza, puesto que es la imagen y gloria de Dios; pero la mujer es la gloria del varón”. Al hombre se le creó primero, y durante algún tiempo estuvo solo, siendo la única criatura en la Tierra hecha a la imagen de Dios. La mujer fue hecha del hombre y habría de estar sujeta a él, mientras que Dios no debe sujetarse a nadie. La jefatura del hombre, sin embargo, está por debajo de la de Dios y la de Cristo. (1Co 11:3-7.)<br>  <br>  Libre albedrío. Debido a que había sido hecho a la imagen de Dios y según su semejanza, el hombre tenía libre albedrío. También disponía de libertad para escoger entre hacer lo bueno o lo malo. Esta libertad le permitía dar mucha más honra y gloria a Dios que la creación animal, pues podía obedecer voluntaria y amorosamente a su Creador. Podía alabarlo de manera inteligente por sus maravillosas cualidades y apoyar su soberanía. Ahora bien, su libertad era relativa, no absoluta. Podía continuar viviendo feliz solo si reconocía la soberanía de Jehová. Esto lo indicaba el árbol del conocimiento de lo bueno y lo malo, del que tenía prohibido comer. Hacerlo sería un acto de desobediencia, una rebelión contra la soberanía de Dios. (Gé 2:9, 16, 17.)<br>  <br>  Como Adán era “hijo de Dios” (Lu 3:38), su relación con Dios era como la de un hijo con su padre; por consiguiente, debería haberle obedecido. Además, Dios creó en el hombre un deseo innato de adorarle. Si este deseo se desvirtuaba, dirigiría al hombre mal y destruiría su libertad, convirtiéndolo en esclavo de lo creado en vez del Creador, lo que, a su vez, resultaría en la degradación del hombre.<br>  <br>  Un hijo celestial de Dios que se rebeló hizo que Eva pecase, y ella puso la tentación ante Adán, quien participó deliberadamente en la rebelión contra Jehová. (Gé 3:1-6; 1Ti 2:13, 14.) Adán y Eva llegaron a ser como aquellos de quienes Pablo habló más tarde en Romanos 1:20-23. Debido a su transgresión, Adán perdió su condición de hijo y su perfección, e introdujo el pecado con la imperfección y la muerte en su descendencia, la entera raza humana. Sus descendientes llevaron desde el nacimiento la imagen de su padre Adán: fueron imperfectos, con la muerte obrando en sus cuerpos. (Gé 3:17-19; Ro 5:12; véase ADáN núm. 1.)

Da nessuna parte Della Bibbia c'è scritto che Eva mangiò una mela. Nel primo libro Della Bibbia CIOè " Genesi" viene ampiamente spiegato DA Dio ad Eva e Adamo che avrebbero potuto mangiare ogni tipo di frutto, tranne quello che nasceva dall'albero del bene e del male.  Non è l'atto di mangiare il frutto che condanna l'intera umanità, ma la DISOBBEDIENZA. Dio aveva dato loro tutto - ogni cosa era stata preparata da Dio- loro non dovevano fare altro che vivere. Lo stesso Adamo aveva avuto il compito di dare un nome a tutti gli animali. Dio aveva detto loro che tutti gli animali sarebbero stati loro sottoposti. Dio creò l'uomo e la donna a Sua immagine, non furono mai ripetute queste parole per gli animali. La disobbedienza si porta dietro l'arroganza e l'egoismo segue a ruota. Ma quello che si avverte più forte è la mancanza di fede. Elemento fondamentale per essere figli di Dio. Non amo sentire battute irriverenti sulla Natura di Dio, e sul fatto che solo Lui creò il Mondo. Mi dispiace constatare che le persone pur di non riconoscere il proprio Creatore preferiscono non investigare profondamente e personalmente la Parola di Dio. Lasciano questo compito alle chiacchere, ai pettegolezzi ma sopratutto danno libertà a tutta la confusione che la Chiesa Cattolica in primis ha portato in Italia e nel resto del mondo. Mi conforta vedere che è solo l'Italia che continua a mantenere le classiche fette di salame sugli occhi, ma gli altri paesi no. Auguro a tutte le persone che non conoscono la Parola di Dio, di avere il desiderio di conoscenza, così la loro prossima domanda avrà il peso che merita.|`|f4ca7f76e9ba2d314d76d9b7281c9dedaa	Dio non ha mangiato la mela.... per il resto, e' un simbolo, e ciccio c  ti ha gia' dato una risposta valida... non e' scritto da nessuna parte che "prima" Adamo ed Eva non provassero dolore o fossero immortali.|`|0gOGyBc8aa	disse: "pagherai col sanghe.... molto sangue!!!....potrai pagare delle piccole rate ogni mese!"<br>  ... e così fu!|`|4400f143cd867ff663bd9fdc93bbe6faaa	Ma perché, non dirmi che credi davvero ad Adamo ed Eva?!<br>  <br>  <br>  Andate con i pollici versi..|`|4DrMd9YVaa	Non credi sia infantile tentare di dare una spiegazione scientifica alla fede?  cmq, il dolore e l'imperfezione si è inserito in tutta la terra e anche negli animali.

Così scese giù e quando vide che invece di lavorare si stavano mangiando una delle mele del suo giardino si incazzò ancora di più, gli tolse la mela e li maledì un tantino perchè non avevano voglia di fare un cavolo e poi gli disse che da quel giorno se volevano mangiare dovevano andare a lavorare la terra e rompersi il c....tutti i giorni. Da lì è nato tutto quel casino che ci portiamo dietro ancora oggi, forse quel povero dio aveva già capito che presto adamo ed eva sarebbero passati da una mela a una pera...

Preso dalla foga ho fatto il giro delle edicole che registrano il tutto esaurito e sono riuscito ad accaparrarmi 4 copie di "GENTE". Inutile dire che sono tutte vincenti. Ho fatto la chiamata e, come il mio amico, anch'io ho vinto un viaggio. Dopo avere visto questo forum ho pensato che è meglio non fare le altre tre telefonate. Cosa facciamo?

Se leggete bene il regolamento (<a href="http://www.marcomair.it/pg.asp?cd=878)" rel="nofollow">http://www.marcomair.it/pg.asp?cd=878)</a> lo stesso parla di solo 5 premi di valore (1 auto,1 tv,1 frigo e 2 condizionatori) mentre parla di minimo 500 vacanze e 978 mp3.

Ho letto e riletto il regolamento e parrebbe in piena regola, dato che darebbe anche la possibilità di non aver vinto. Ovviamente mi pare alquanto improbabile che ci ritroveremo tutti in vacanza insieme, scordatevi tutti di aver vinto gratis la vacanza. Ma quello che più mi lascia perplesso è il fatto che nel concorso vengano usati marchi come Bmw, Mini e Samsung. Perchè una causa con un privato possono anche permettersela. Ma una causa contro quei colossi non penso proprio. A meno che non abbiano anche loro interessi in questa probabile truffa, ma non penso rimettano la faccia per così poco.

3be02bb9b9ddbaa5e419bf04011f58ebaa	Maria SS ha un piano: salvare il mondo intero.<br>  La Madonna ha dato come messaggio principale a Medjugorje la conversione.<br>  Conversione vuol dire inversione, cambiamento radicale di vita. <br>  E' come quando uno si accorge che ha preso una direzione sbagliata con l'auto e cambia alla direzione opposta. <br>  Siamo in un mondo in cui, purtroppo, molti hanno abbandonato la Fede e c'è un'apostasia silenziosa in atto; in molti paesi non c'è più nemmeno la trasmissione della Fede dei genitori ai figli.<br>  La Madonna invita innanzitutto i credenti alla conversione perchè siano a loro volta strumenti di conversione per gli altri.<br>  La Madonna diede un messaggio ai credenti della Parrocchia di Medjugorje dicendo convertitevi voi affinchè anche gli altri possono convertirsi.<br>  Medjugorje è diventato il più internazionale dei pellegrinaggi mariani.<br>  L'umanità è al bivio della vita e della morte e Dio desidera convertire il mondo intero.<br>  Conversione significa che io da una vita vecchia passo ad una vita nuova, diversa.<br>  Io sono stato battezzato da piccolo, sono stato credente ma non praticante da adolescente e mi sono convertito alla religione cattolica vissuta dai 23 anni in poi.<br>  Ho compreso che non c'è nessun altra salvezza al di fuori di Dio.<br>  Dio è la Fonte e il Principio di ogni essere e Dio chiama tutti a Lui.<br>  La conversione è possibile solo per amore, in qualsiasi ambito accada: posso convertirmi ad una vita onesta, a Dio... ma solo se vivo un'esperienza d'amore, intensa vera... se non c'è esperienza dell'amore di Dio allora la vita non cambierà, e alla prima difficoltà può scoppiare una crisi.<br>  Al di la di tutto, quello che la Madonna decide si realizza: difronte alla Madonna e al soprannaturale gli uomini sono meno che le formiche, se si oppongono c'è un momento in cui Dio li spazza via, dice basta e poi come Giuda vanno ad impiccarsi.<br>  La Madonna parla da Madre: dal profondo del cuore dice "accettatemi" fin tanto che siete in tempo.<br>  La Madonna ringrazia anche per tutti i sacrifici che si offrono a Lei.<br>  <br>  <br>  Pace e bene|`|8a1OU3Rzaa	Basta guardare anche superficialmente questa nostra povera società per rendersi conto di quanto sia importante la conversione dei nostri cuori.|`|9Bx9QjL0aa	Non avrai mai la mia anima!

Quante chiacchere inutili facciamo spesso nella giornata e a quante cose inutili e sciocche prestiamo attenzione! E' un richiamo continuo che la Vergine fa da sempre in molte sue apparizioni, ma più frequentemente da due secoli e più! Il mondo sta precipitando sempre più in basso per la perdita del senso di Dio e dei valori morali, spirituali e civili...si anche civili! basta vedere cosa è diventata la politica e cosa non si fa per il potere politico...<br>  Impariamo a riconoscere i segni dei tempi!|`|d0e7cddcc91c7db6d6dbfd7ee8ce8e34aa	Conversione nel senso di lasciare la via sbagliata per la buona, infatti pur credendo in Dio spesso si perde la strada e ci si deve riconvertire. :)|`|izvuJgDkaa	ciao ^_^<br>  per me intende convertirci al bene... finché siamo in tempo.<br>  perché prima di distruggere gli altri e il mondo stiamo distruggendo noi stessi.|`|SnRsCStfaa	Conversione è il sostantivo di convertire|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	può essere la conversione dell'anima.....sempre sperando in bene.....

Puedes decirle que te encontro el médico una bacteria que se agarra por ropa interior, etc y que te recomendó no tener relaciones sexuales por los momentos.<br>  <br>  Y en cuanto a lo que te ocurrio, no vayas nunca sola a ese tipo de reuniones, ya que veo que tus amigos abusaron de tí al verte mareada o tal vez tu no lo sabes y te pusieron algo en la bebida para despues abusar de tí.<br>  <br>  Suerte y que todo te salga bien, y cuidate mucho para la próxima. Cuando bebas licor, siempre trata de ir con alguien muy conocido que te cuide y esté pendiente de tí, nunca con hombres solos  y menos si no los conoces bien.<br>  <br>  Mientras puedes constantemente labarte con agua fria y jabón ya que como te mencione arriba no puedes ponerte lavados vaginales ni pomadas ni nada de eso hasta que el ginecólogo no te examine, ya que así puedes da?ar o esconder momentaneamente la infección que puedas tener.<br>  <br>  Besitos y que pronto se te quite ese malestar fisico y emocional que tienes. <br>  <br>  nota, si tienes confianza en tu novio, también podrías contarle que te violaron para que te defienda de esos ruines para que no se lo hagan a otra chica.|`|6970ba896dfd7354dbe39c7b925e2fb2aa	Pues creo que ya llegó el momento de ya sientes cabeza y dejes de tener esa vida promiscua, yo creo que el sexo debe de hacerse por amor y pues acude al servicio de emergencias y hazte las pruebas necesarias y ya porfas respeta tu cuerpo como un templo sagrado.|`|a679b3347dd049b7fa43c6ff8fa34aa5aa	Prueba a ir a un hospital o clinica.

Eso está visto cuando te eliminan una pregunta o respuesta que no tiene nada malo ni ofensivo ni que viole las normas de YR, la prueba está, en que hice una diciéndoles a mis amigos que estaba de cumplea?os ese día, y me la eliminaron, le escribí a los moderadores de YR y me respondieron eso...que tal y me enviaron nuevamente a revisar las normas de este foro.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Este es un tema dificil de debatir y más en este Foro, donde lo que hacen la mayoria es insultar y ofender, sin dar respuestas concretas de porque son ateos. Pienso particularmente que no es necesario llegar a las ofensas y faltas de respeto.<br>  <br>  Pero acuerdate que Dios nos dió el libre albedrío de creer o no creer y eso se respeta, pero hay personas que eso no lo entienden y quieren imponer sus ideologías de una manera grotezca e insulsa. <br>  <br>  Siempre encontrarás personas ofensivas como el primero que te respondió, te das cuenta que no dan respuestas concretas y decentes? solo ofenden y piensan que así demuestran su ideología. Pienso que nadie tiene la VERDAD ABSOLUTA para que lleguemos  a las peleas y conflictos que se ven a diario en este Foro.<br>  <br>  Además recuerda que cuando se trata de Religión y Política, siempre habran conflictos por ser temas difíciles de debatir. Entiendo tu posición, de no llegar a ofendernos, pero, si te ofenden uno muy decentemente también tiene el derecho de defenderse. Cuando terminan los derechos de uno, ahí comienzan los del otro.<br>  <br>  También debe de influir mucho, la educación y la edad de la persona o de algunos participantes, por el tipo de respuestas o preguntas que realizan.<br>  <br>  Ojala podamos llegar a ese punto que tu mencionas, DEBATIR SANAMENTE SIN LLEGAR A OFENDERNOS UNOS A OTROS. NI TRATAR DE IMPONERNOS TAMPOCO. Sino respetarnos las creencias e ideologías de cada quien. <br>  <br>  Que aburrido fuese el mundo si todos pensaramos igual.

En oración a Dios, él también dijo: “Tu palabra es la verdad” (Juan 17:17). ?Dónde se expone la “palabra” de Dios, su verdad? El apóstol Pablo responde: “Toda Escritura es inspirada de Dios” (2?Timoteo 3:16). El Creador todopoderoso del universo afirma así que ha sido el autor de la Biblia. Mediante su poderosa fuerza activa, o espíritu santo, movió a hombres fieles a poner por escrito Sus pensamientos. Así, cuando leemos las Escrituras, es como si Dios nos estuviera hablando. Los humanos pueden ser autores de libros, y Dios creó a los humanos, ?no podría el Creador hacer lo mismo? Cuando el locutor de una emisora habla por un micrófono, su mensaje se oye a miles de kilómetros de distancia. Aun desde la Luna se han transmitido hasta nuestro hogar imágenes de televisión de ciertos acontecimientos. Pero Jehová hizo el oído, el ojo, la electricidad y el sonido. ?No podría él, mediante su “energía dinámica”, proyectar sus pensamientos a sus siervos fieles en la Tierra? ?Claro que sí, el Creador de este magnífico universo podía crear un libro!

2ec47569fe819cc62d63db7738409ca6aa	La nostra anima immortale è stata fatta a Sua immagine e somiglianza.Io credo in un Dio che ha dato il via alla cosa più incredibile :la vita, che ha regalato a questa vita una energia inimmaginabile: l' anima razionale, che poi, s'è "tolto dattorno" perché a quel capolavoro di creatura "creata"" aveva anche concesso la possibilità di arrivare con le sole sue forze a mete inimmaginabili, dopo avergli fatto il regalo più prezioso pericoloso di tutti:la libertà. Il che vuol dire che Dio non aveva creato degli schiavetti senza volontà da sistemare in un limbo etereo,privo di emozioni, ma persone responsabili e autosufficienti, capaci di progresso. Sono convinta che non ci sia bisogno di Dio per evitare lo scempio di bambini mutilati,sfruttati,violati,ma semplicemente di un po' di giustizia, di equità, di uguaglianza, di responsabilità...cose tutte che sono in mano all'uomo. Perfino i disastri della natura sono nelle sue mani. Molti,troppi, li provoca la sua ingordigia.Io credo in un Dio che si fa gli affari suoi perché è inconcepibile che dopo aver creato un capolavoro ci debba rimettere le mani per appiccicare toppe qua e là....allora non era un capolavoro ma uno schifo. Speriamo che prima o poi ,l' uomo capisca che dipende da lui avere una società di uomini/capolavoro o una società di cani arrabbiati.|`|acb78e00a3dd276bf7b6e8b766c439b5aa	Perchè l'uomo non può accettare che un essere superiore non possa avere le sue somiglianze..|`|afe8c0400a9eff0bc304f9eddbfa6f2caa	Spero per Lui che non sia vero.|`|ba9d9b5ebe2b1508ec29fee4e507ff43aa	Dio è purissimo Spirito e non ha corpo fisico.

What we may strongly believe now will transform, and so variate considerably as we journey through time and space. It may grow stronger or it may grow weaker, it may even become nothing, of course this is contingent on how much power or lack of power we channel and allocate to the belief, or it could be that our belief in the belief is attenuated by tumultuous conditions. Many also do attempt to trammel and preserve the original model of their belief system from evolving, due to fear of either violating the parameters of their belief, or simply wanting to permanently stick to what they know. We need to flow with our belief and trust its design to take us where we need to be, without that constant tenacious clenched grip.

WqXABiCsaa	On December 20th or 21st (can't remember) of 2012 is the last day of the Mayan calendar. Oddly enough this day is also is a big day in the world of astronomy. All of the planets will be aligned on the same axis i believe.<br>  Some possible scenarios are that this could cause the earths magentic poles to switch (north becomes south and vise versa) and if that were to happen quickly then we would be screwed.<br>  <br>  What gets most people so worked up is that this is real science were talking about here but combining that with the end of the Mayan calendar make it all the more spooky. <br>  <br>  But don't worry, there will be a blockbuster movie coming out this summer which will make sure that everyone will be in a panic.<br>  <a href="http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/2012/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/trailers/sony/2012/</a><br>  <br>  Overall most scientists agree nothing will happen and if anything this is the start of a new age. We will be leaving the age Pisces and entering Aquarius. Fun fact: the word age was misinterpreted in Bible (along with many other things) to time. Instead of people calling this the "end of an Age" it is better known as the "end of Times" which most refer to as doomsday.|`|m2WGmGXjaa	Most people believe that because the Mayan calender ends, but the truth is that 2012 is actually the start of something positive, not the destruction of mankind. In 1899 something called the Schumann Cavity Resonance was discovered. It's the "heartbeat" or the frequency of the Earth. Until 1986 this frequency was a constant 7.8 Hertz per second. It started to raise dramatically in 1986 and in 1998 was reported to be 10 Hertz per second. While the earths heartbeat increases, the magnetics of the earth are dropping dramatically. The magnetics are expected to reach the zero point in 2012. Now although the Mayan calendar may end in 2012 it is not the end of the world, just the beginning of a new one due to the fact that every 26,000 years the Earth goes through a grand cycle of evolution. Besides it's just common sense once one calender ends, you go to the next one.|`|iZsAnewfaa	Well people also said that the world was also gunna end in the year 2000, but it didnt. I was watching the history channel and it was giving information on how this guy wrote an ancient book saying how they world was going to come to an end. Go to the history channel. A lot of good information. I dont really believe it. But it was supposed to be the end of the Mayan calander.|`|U9cLxjUjaa	ALLLL this is is hype from the History Channel trying to make money and raise ratings for their "2012" shows.  The Mayans never said the end of the world is coming in 2012, their calender simply stops (I have a desk calender made by Mead, it only goes to April of 2010, that doesn't mean the end of the world is in 2010, that means that's the date the calender stops).  <br>  <br>  Look up youtube video "debunking 2012" or something like that, some guy gives a really good explanation of everything, and cites his sources.<br>  <br>  No religion truly believes the world will end in 2012. <br>  <br>  Nothing guarantees that you, me, or anyone else will even be around in 2012 to see it end ... I could get hit by a bus an hour after writing this (kinda creepy huh?).  Nobody knows when the world will end, for each of us our personal ends will happen at different times.  So don't worry about 2012, just live life to the fullest. I'm sure we'll all be laughing about this in 2013.|`|DUq74Xr7aa	It's just a myth but lets talk about it.<br>  <br>  The mayans believed there would be something like a revolution at the year 2012. (It's the last date in their calendar)<br>  <br>  Also, the bible predicted the people who saw Israel become a nation would see the return of Jesus. (Those people only have so many years left before this prediction becomes void and 2012 seems like a great year to claim the return of Jesus! lol)<br>  <br>  I'm not 100% sure but I believe nostradamus predicted world war 3 or the end of the world for 2012!<br>  <br>  Also, some people believe a dark star called nibiru will make it's entrance into our solar system. - There is no proof of it, however, there's plenty of theories on the Google about it!|`|03602b1cce42bfcc3e99b3e415d87d4aaa	Because people aren't treating this earth right. By 2012, global warming will have taken over and there will be nothing we can do to stop it. The sun will probably explode or god knows what else, or all the animals will go extinct which means the plants will go too and they are our source of oxygen. As everyone knows, you need oxygen to live. We will then all suffocate and die.

Satanists and many pagan cultures from every corner of the world all throughout history have celebrated this like the Sumerians, Babylonians, Cherokee, Hopi, Chinese I-Ching (confirmed by Terence McKenna), Mayans (Pacal Votan; Chilam Balam of Tizimin, Mani, Chumayel; Jaguar Prophet), Egyptians, Celts, etc. This evil event is called "the abomination that causes desolation" that will be set up in the Jewish Temple's Holy of Holies when the antichrist is imbued with the spirit of satan himself. When will Jesus come? Only God Himself knows exactly, but very soon in "the twinkling of an eye" and like "a thief in the night".

Gamus6...? vaya preguntitua...! ?... no ? soy consciente de que aquí intenvendrá mucho la mera creencia o la buena fe al especular acerca  de si sí o si no; pero bueno, algo se sabe no obstante, y lo poco que yo sé te/os lo voy a transmitir como lo han hecho conmigo; nosotrros nos encontramos en la región más densa de las siete de que consta el 7o plano, y existen 7 en total; a  lacabeza del 1o plano se halla el denominado EL UNO, quien engendró a solas al Hijo; y éste, quien concibió-imaginó todo el Universo con todas sus formas, fue el Fiat Creator, quien dijo: "... hágase la luz"; de ellos dos procede el 3er. aspecto de la Trinidad Cósmica, representada por el Movimiento, aspecto-Ser a quien incumbió determinar los distintos planos con sus contenidos concebidos por el El Hijo, pero bajo los ángulos y densidades respectivos para que encajaran en el orden previsto por EL UNO cuando decidió conformar el Universo; así,  pues, a cada aspecto de la Trinidad les incumben cuestiones determinadas y distintas, existiendo una armonía total entre ellos; por ejemplo: ? la luz blanca no se descompone en los 3 colores primarios... ? pues bien ? y los 3 colores primarios no se desdoablan constituyendo los 7 del espectro o arco iris ... ? Y la luz blanca ? no es Una ? ? y no hay armonía en ella y, a su vez, entre el resto de colores de que es capaz ? Bueno, pues mira, Gamus6, más allá todavía de EL UNO, el Supremo ARquitecto del Universo, más allá aún, se encuentra EL ABSOLUTO, de quien emanó EL UNO; de él sólo podemos decir que está más allá de toda comprensión humana o de cualquier símil que pueda expresarse con palabras, dado que toda manifestación implica limitación; únicamente podemos decir que es un Ser Ilimitado: La Raíz de toda Existencia; entonces, y volviendo a tu pregunta,  ? no podríamos resumirla echando la vista atrás, hacia lo explicado para darnos cuenta que el supremo/supremo poder no podemos ni preverlo ni mucho menos acanzarlo ni comprenderlo ? Hazte cuenta de que nuestro Sistema Solar, aquí, donde vivimos, lo construyó/conformó nuestro Dios llamado El Padre, lejísimos en evolución del Supremo Arquitecto del Universo total que, como ya hemos indicado, comprender 7 planos y nosotros- insisto- nos encontramos en el más inferior, que asu vez quiere decir inferior en espiritualidad y, por tanto, en poder también; En fin, amigo, lee esto un poco despacio, pues podría parecer que es un galimatías, pero no lo es; todo lo complejo es más perfecto que lo meramente simple; Un abrazo. eledendo|`|151bc1cd23a8511013a07b6553e9f7d5aa	Sí, la fuerza de la gravedad.

Best Of Luck :)|`|aLGe7JZEaa	Without a doubt, the most commonly encountered lucky charm in modern North America is the horseshoe and its representative models in the form of jewelry, wall hangings, and printed images.<br>  <br>  This little horseshoe, shown here life-size, is actually a hand-forged pony shoe that my daughter Althaea and i discovered and dug out of the ground one day in 1976 while we were walking an old logging trail through the woods in the Missouri Ozarks. It probably dates from the 1910s to 1930s.<br>  <br>  The use of worn-out horseshoes as magically protective amulets -- especially hung above or next to doorways -- originated in Europe, where one can still find them nailed onto houses, barns, and stables from Italy through Germany and up into Britain and Scandinavia. Additionally, wall hangins made in the form of horseshoes are common. In the Middle-East, one finds the terra cotta blue-glazed horseshoe plaque. In Turkey small metal or blue glass horseshoes are blended with the protective all-seeing eye to form a unique apotropaic charm i call the horseshoe-and-eyes that is believed to ward off the evil eye.<br>  <br>  There is good reason to suppose that the crescent form of the horseshoe links the symbol to pagan Moon goddesses of ancient Europe such as Artemis and Diana, and that the protection invoked is that of the goddess herself, or, more particularly, of her sacred vulva. As such, the horseshoe is related to other magically protective doorway-goddesses, such as the Irish sheela-na-gig, and to lunar protectresses such as the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is often shown standing on a crescent moon and placed within a vulval mandorla or vesica pisces.<br>  <br>  In most of Europe, the Middle-East, and Spanish-colonial Latin America protective horseshoes are placed in a downward facing or vulval position, as shown here, but in some parts of Ireland and Britain people believe that the shoes must be turned upward or "the luck will run out." Americans of English and Irish descent prefer to display horseshoes upward; those of German, Austrian, Italian, Spanish, and Balkan descent generally hang them downward.<br>  <br>  In regions where the horseshoe is placed facing upward, folks believe the horseshoe must point up "or the luck runs out." In places where it is hung facing downward they say exactly the opposite -- "it must point down so the luck can pour onto you." However, in its function as an amulet for magical protection, especially over the doorways of barns and stables, the horseshoe usually points downward and it is said that "no witch will pass under it." The "Good Luck" horseshoe image i use on my web pages came from a 1940s American printer's stock cut book, probably drawn and engraved by a German-American, hence the horseshoe points downward.<br>  <br>  What does the difference in directionality mean? I think that in most of the world it is the horseshoe ITSELF that is lucky and protective -- whereas in England and Ireland the horseshoe is seen as a mere "collector" of luck from above. There are other regional and cultural differences in horseshoe beliefs, too:<br>  <br>  In Italy, for instance, when a horseshoe is nailed by the side of the door (not above it), directionality is not considered important, but what IS important is that the horseshoe was actually used -- worn and discarded by a horse -- that it was found in the road or in a field, not purchased, and that the person who enters the door can touch it.<br>  <br>  In Mexico, used horseshoes are also prized, but instead of being touched for luck or protection, they are wrapped in colourful rayon thread, decorated with sequins and holy prints of the horseback-riding San Martin Caballero, wrapped in vinyl, and backed with a prayer or a magical incantation called El Secreto de la Virtuoso Herradura.<br>  <br>  The distinctions between luck, protection, religion, and magic are nowhere more ambiguous than in the uses of the horseshoe amulet. Although actual horseshoes still serve a magically protective function when nailed above a door, modern horseshoe jewelry is worn not for its protective aspects but for its "lucky" power. In particular, due to a natural association with horse-racing, the miniature horseshoe has become something of a gambler's lucky charm. Furthermore, because horseshoes resemble horseshoe magnets, printed images of horseshoes -- especially on magical or spiritual product labels aimed at African-American hoodoo practitioners -- are often shown "drawing" money to themselves as if they partook of the powers usually ascribed to lodestones. <br>  <br>  New York!!|`|a4LWildhaa	Better point up. If it faces open end down, never will have luck because it will fall out.|`|zeTGmB3faa	I don't believe this sort of thing, but think that I read somewhere the the open ends point up so the luck doesn't run out.
HOQp0gA7aa	As an Agnostic I have to go with (A) lack of proof for or against theism.  I think the people who think you can prove the lack of God by an inability to establish evidence still need to understand the fundamental use of logic.  Just because I may fail to establish that I am a human being instead of a sophisticated computer program, it does not mean I can not still be a living a human being.  A lack of evidence is only proof of a lack of evidence.  <br>  <br>  In terms of having a (B) naturalistic point of view, then yes I believe that the natural is fairly conclusive, and can be proved through the use of experimentation and the use of science and logic.  However, once again as an Agnostic I also understand that by definition the concepts expressed in the metaphysical, supernatural, and spiritual are by definition not bound to the rules of the natural, and thus can not be established or discredited through natural means such as science.  <br>  <br>  I agree that (C) the historical record supports that there have been many former religions that have lost followers and transitioned into mythologies instead of faiths.  Historically it can also be seen that new religions have developed or changed from the seeds of ideas planted by men.  The protestant revolution under Martin Luther is a fine example of one alteration of religion to fit the needs and desires of a society.  The followers of Joseph Smith in the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints are a fine example of adding scripture to an existing faith.  Scientology is another nice example of a nascent religion just begining to form from the nothingness of human conception.  <br>  <br>  However, history does not prove or disprove whether there was a metaphysical or supernatural inspiration for these adaptions or creations.  Those elements have been placed into the realm of faith, not the pens of the historians to decide.  Anyone who has studied history in a serious manner understands the point of view that is told can frequently be altered to suit the desires of the teller.  Events have as many perspectives as the people who witness and study them.  Where one person sees divine providence as patently obvious, another person sees a the result of chaos dynamics as the source.  <br>  <br>  Thus I stick with saying I'm an Agnostic because I don't know who may be telling a lie about history.  I can not say that the concepts expressed by the supernatural and metaphysical have to obey natural laws.  I only accept that a lack of proof equals a lack of proof, not proof of non-existance.  That is the only response my rational thinking process can provide.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|v7Wflu78aa	b) Naturalistic POV<br>  c) God is a part of cultures|`|QVKWVValaa	c, b, a|`|TeJuytjZaa	A<br>  C<br>  B|`|AA10721549	d/ stupid design<br>  from macro -> just one small niche to fit the not too hot, not too cold planet in the solar system<br>  <br>  to micro->Why do we need paired atoms of nearly all gasses, if helium, argon,xenon, radon and most of solid stuff works fine with one atomed...<br>  <br>  not to speak of:<br>  prostatic gland efectively blocking the pee-tube<br>  male nipples<br>  appendix|`|1oYjjp0Daa	all of the above and many more deserve equal weight.

However, to have a blessed life (meaning blessings from God) you accept His son, Jesus Christ, as your Savior and maintain a personal relationship with God.  This personal relationship includes prayer, but also involves many other things.  Keep in mind that a blessed life does not mean getting the things that you as a human being think that you deserve.  It means living in the freedom of truth.  The only one who can increase the "power" of a prayer is God.|`|Wb7n512Waa	A prayer is a state of  heart. The heart is the center of all your desires. The strongest desire at any given moment is the prayer that you emit and no matter what words you may form as a prayer, it won't matter if your heart doesn't agree. The corporeal life is just a means for us to develop towards our spiritual life and thus prayers for corporeal good fortune fall short of  the goal of our life because corporeal pleasures are but little tiny sparks that disappear compared to the expanding joy a person feels in spirituality. The only prayer that evokes a response from above is the prayer to connect with God, the Creator, and request to know Him by exiting yourself and entering spirituality. Others who have experienced the sensation and knowledge of God have given us, though their books and writings, a method to help us do the same. A person who acquires the method of developing in himself the right prayer has a great blessing in his hand and is considered to be very lucky in the sense that he advances in spirituality because this is where we receive lasting fulfillment and a sensation of completeness. <br>  Here is a video that explains prayer:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/prayer" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a><br>  <br>  Here is an introduction to the method that leads you to the greatest fulfillment:<br>  <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah-video-clips/introduction-to-kabbalah" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/kabbalah...</a>|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	Increase your faith, i.e trust in God, since prayers without faith are a mostly vain effort, according to New Testament ideas.

But it is true that the names are not correct (as in being translated literally) they were translated out of the Latin. But then the name of Jesus is not his true name either, it is a Greek word and began with an I instead of a J because there are no J's in the ancient Greek language. The word Jesus/Iesus means "Hail/Worship Zeus". Christ's real Hebrew name is Yeshuah (I think that I spelled that correctly) and it means "the son of the living God.|`|stEUrlwjaa	There always is and will be a problem of this kind with any translation of any book, not the bible only.  When a good translator does his or her job they translate images and ideas rather than the word itself because sometimes words in one language do not make any sense in another.  However, it would be interesting to know who do you consider a foreigner.  If a person accept a religious teaching he or she is not a stranger any more and it does not matter where they came from.  For example, by one or another reason in America everybody is from somewhere else.  You are depriving yourself of learning about many interesting views even though they might not coincide with your own.  You are not the holder of absolute truth, only the Almighty is.  As far as the Gospels go, some of them were not included in the Bible because they did not fit interests or did not coincide with the views of Christian politicians of the day.|`|X8LNbaKQaa	...accurate account of the scriptures?!<br>  <br>  (wiping tear from eye, catching breath) <br>  <br>  Good one.

dc00e6f724cc094e75dc0475843d0e44aa	If you really want to learn of a Christian church that follows the Bible.....if you have a sincerity to study the doctrine closely without being persuaded by long standing bias, if you want to see that there is indeed a church out there that is organized in the same manner that Christ organized the church when he walked the earth, then you can look here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http:///www.mormon.org" rel="nofollow">http:///www.mormon.org</a><br>  <br>  Its called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.|`|UinOWcMUaa	It's how God said it would be in the last days-- doctorines of Demons ! The Church has catered to tolerance and water's down the message.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 4:3 “For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.”<br>  <br>  Here is why we need to be on our guard during these latter days, and that is because we have come to the time when men will not endure sound doctrine. Today we live in a time when men will not put up with true healthy doctrine from the Word of God.  Men do not want the truth, what they want is to have their itchy ears scratched, in other words they want their ears tickled with those things that are pleasing and encouraging.  Therefore, they heap or literally accumulate and seek additional teachers who will give them what they want.<br>  <br>  They will turn from the truth and turn unto fables or tales of fiction rather then the true Word of God.  Therefore, we are urged to watch, to be discreet concerning what we are taught, to endure afflictions, hardship and trouble, because they will certainly come to those who are willing and desirous to give and receive the true Word of God.|`|AA10249608	God is not in the church,He is in the heart,and we give to help others.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	The more it is "dumbed down" the easier it is to make $$$|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Yeah they aren't Christians they're wolves in sheeps clothing, leading the flock.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	too many people Take the Bible out of context. There are not much TRUE CHRISTIANS out there now a days.|`|AA11008046	I am not sure how to reply to the term dumbed-down but let me move to the second portion of your script.  Any body who bows down to their clergy and/or any portion, statue, religious jewellery or whatever is not in line with Scripture.  that in fact is idol worship.  You note often times our Mexican friends will kiss the crucifix around their neck.  I suggest that if the Jesus on the crucifix is not in their heart; then they are only kissing jewellery and it does nothing.  Donating money is not wrong until you donate more than you can afford and by so doing think you are buying a front row seat in Heaven.  That becomes totally wrong, indeed.  If you children do without because of any monies donated that are not within your means you are being foolish.<br>  Mainline churches of today have wavered in their teachings of Jesus; the life, the way, the truth, because they do not want to offend any one.  Jesus would have said "..if my teaching offends you then travel on and don't listen.."  But our clergy today need large offerings to maintain a lifestyle that is far better than the average of their parishioners and that too, I believe, is wrong.|`|NWopkX4baa	Many intellectuals and scholars have become convinced that Christianity doesn't offer all the answers and have eventually turned away from the faith. So, the only remaining believers are average people who are not primarily interested in the truth-value of the Christian message, but are looking for some sort of community network and emotional crutch. This makes it a lot easier to be turned into the lowest-common demoninator and manipulated for political control.<br>  <br>  I think it's mainly due to the political manipulation, the Right wing encourages anti-intellecutalism so they can keep the rich richer and the poor poorer.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	The short answer is; "That Ole Time Religion" wasn't putting butts in the seats anymore; and people who don't attend church, don't fill the collection plate.<br>  <br>  As someone much wiser than myself once observed: if you want to know the real reasons for people's actions, FOLLOW THE MONEY; and when they insist that it's not about the money, it is ALWAYS about the money.|`|AyPF2TFlaa	Give them what they want to hear and they'll come back for more.<br>  Easy religion with a big rapture to take you away before all the trouble starts is a good seller, and of course the tried and tested give to God and get a hundred fold back,Man there's some pastors flying their own plains with maids to clean there million plus dollar homes, People are just stupid no getting away from it.<br>  I Love Catholicism by the way.|`|yugLcDE2aa	not dumbed-down, just not led by the Holy Spirit, but by man and traditions. Easily misled due to lack of individual study, prayer, and just waiting on God. I'd say more lazy than anything else.

Greed and fame has lured some to start these large, commercialized churches for their personal profit.<br>  <br>  I think of it as "counterfeit Christianity"; much like counterfeit money looks like the real thing but has no value, the same is true of counterfeit Christianity.<br>  <br>  "Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves"<br>  — Matthew 7:15<br>  <br>  For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light. Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness; whose end shall be according to their works."<br>  — 2nd Corinthians 11:13-15<br>  <br>  Persecution has proven ineffective to stop Christianity; in fact, persecution makes Christianity spread faster.<br>  <br>  So, if you can't beat them, join them, and corrupt from within; the effect will be the same.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't knowingly drink poison, so something that was labeled, "Poison, please drink me", you wouldn't fall for it.<br>  <br>  But if it was something you did like, but had poison hidden in it, you would be more likely to fall for it.<br>  <br>  The same with the false Christianity that you describe.

We are blessed with families and a wonderful Earth that He has provided for us... so why is it so hard for people to be at least civil?<br>  <br>  I think you should ask a Priest or a Minister, they'll welcome your question and hopefully answer it for you.

The Queen's married name Mountbatten is similarly made up since they would not let her marry Philip with an equally Germanic name just after WW2.<br>  <br>  Next thing is that the Queen is 82 years old.<br>  <br>  The Civil List was in return for handing over Crown estates to the nation.<br>  <br>  And as for no work - being Head of State and Head of the Commonwealth, the Queen puts in more work than many captains of industry with a fraction of the bonuses.  And she does it when most people would have retired long ago.<br>  <br>  Unlike self-made executives and celebrities, the aristocracy have a tradition of "noblesse oblige". This requires them to work for their privileges by doing community work and supporting good causes, or risk losing these privileges.

I guess it never occured to you that the greatest drag on the British economy and the tax pay comes from the rediculous amount of wasteful spending by the government, even before the 'global recession' we were billions of pounds in detb.<br>  <br>  over the past 10 years the EU has cost us ￡148.2 billion on unwanted restrictive and intrusive regulations of which 72% of our regulation stems from the EU, and other than the vast majority being pure  buraucracy its illegal by way of contradicting the constitution. This cost by the way is enough to abolish income tax for a year or cut our national detb by 24%. its never been a better time to resign our membership and go back to the free trade licence we signed up to.<br>  <br>  So yes, 'you' and people like you disgust me. I bet you haven't even bothered to read, Common Law, The Coronation Oath, Magna Carta, Statute of Westminster, The Petition of Right, Declaration of Right and Bill of Rights, The Act of Settlement of 1701, or The Act of Union all making up the British constitution* before spluttering you stupidity did you. No, because if you did you would realise that not only is the monarchy important for us, but that it should never be over thrown.|`|Kr0ZDyp2aa	Call it "She waves, but for a price" ;)|`|Ku3A8kkzaa	It is a bit weak for my liking, what about something like;<br>  <br>  "The British Monarchy Over 1000 Years of Tyranny"
YupMCYHlaa	It's a 'compound sentence', because it has several ideas put together.  It has three clauses:  Alice was waiting for the elevator doors toopen.  Alice was humming a song.  Alice saw her boss.  As you see, each could be its own sentence.<br>  <br>  The main subject is 'Alice'. The main verb is 'hummed'.  The first and last clause are 'subordinate' clauses. The main part of the sentence is about Alice humming to herself.<br>  <br>  Subordinate clauses are connected by commas.  The use of commas is a little tricky, more of an art than a science.  The words 'while' and 'until' are conjunctions, meaning they show that the phrase is a subordinate phrase.  So commas aren't always strictly necessary.  In this case, the first one shows that the doors weren't opening Alice.  A comma before the 'until'  is not necessary because the meaning is clear without it.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	I'm English so i'll help you. =D<br>  <br>  First, in English, 'problems' is plural, so you have to say 'many' problems, not ' much problems'. 'Much' is a singular quantifier. <br>  <br>  - This is a complex sentence because it includes a subdorinate clause. <br>  - The phrase before the comma is the clause, because it doesn't make sense alone.<br>  - The main subject is Alice and the main verb is hummed. <br>  - When a clause comes before the main idea, a comma must follow it. A full stop has to be at the end of the sentence. <br>  <br>  Good luck. =D

Primero, ?qué es el mal? Es aquello que está contra Dios. Es cualquier cosa moralmente mala o errónea. Es injuriosa, depravada, impía. Algunos ejemplos podrían ser el asesinato, la violación, el robo, la mentira y el enga?o. Segundo, si deseamos que Dios detenga el mal, ?deseamos que lo detenga todo, o sólo parte de él? Es decir, si sólo parte del mal, ?cuál parte y por qué? Si Dios sólo detiene parte del mal, todavía podríamos preguntar, "?Por qué existe el mal en el mundo?" <br>  Supongamos que alguien estuviese por cometer un homicidio. Dios debería detenerlo, tal vez susurrando en su oído o, si eso no funciona con algo más drástico como hacer que caiga alguna cosa sobre el homicida, o que su corazón se detenga, o hacer que sus manos se le caigan repetinamente. En cualquier caso, Dios debería hacer algo. <br>  ?Y si alguien intentase robar? Dios también debería detenerlo, ?no es verdad? Indudablemente, la imaginación de Dios posibilita métodos más prácticos que los que he sugerido, pero el resultado final sería el mismo. <br>  ?Y las mentiras? Si alguien estuviera por mentir, entonces para ser coherente con tu pensamiento ?no quisieras que Dios estuviera ahí para impedir que esa persona mienta? Después de todo, El no podría permitir ningún mal, ?no es cierto? <br>  Avancemos un paso más. Supongamos que alguien piensa algo malo. Entonces, por supuesto, Dios debería intevenir e impedirle pensar ninguna cosa mala en absoluto, ?no es verdad? El resultado sería que Dios no podría permitir que nadie pensase libremente. Ya que todos piensan , y nadie piensa solamente buenos pensamientos Dios estaría bastante ocupado y nosotros no podríamos pensar. De todos modos, ?en qué punto nos detenemos? ?En la etapa de asesinato, de robo, de mentira o de pensamiento? Como lo indica tu pregunta, si anhelas que Dios detenga el mal, tendrías que ser consistente y querer que El lo hiciera siempre y en todas partes, no a veces y en algunas partes. Esto último no serviría. <br>  El mal está en este mundo en parte porque nosotros le damos lugar pero en último extremo porque Dios, en Su soberanía, lo permite (véase B) y lo mantiene bajo su contralor. <br>  Entonces podrías decir, "?No podría El simplemente habernos hecho perfectos y que de este modo no pecásemos?" El ya hizo esto. El hizo un ángel perfecto, Satán, pero éste pecó. El hizo un hombre perfecto, Adán, y pecó. El hizo una mujer perfecta, Eva, y también pecó. Dios sabe lo que hace. El nos hizo como somos con un propósito. Nosotros no entendemos tal propósito por completo, pero El sí. <br>  Dios es soberano. Tiene el derecho de hacer lo que le plazca. Tiene el derecho de permitir el mal para lograr su voluntad definitiva. ?Cómo puede hacer esto? Simplemente, mire la cruz. Fue por medios malvados que los hombres mintieron y crucificaron a Jesús. Empero Dios, en Su infinita sabiduríautilizó este mal para bien. Fue en la cruz que Jesús cargó con nuestro pecado en Su cuerpo (1 Pedro 2:24) y es debido a la cruz que podemos tener el perdón de nuestros pecados. <br>  Considera el ejemplo bíblico de José, en el Antiguo Testamento. El fue vendido omo esclavo por sus hermanos. Aunque ellos deseaban hacer un mal, Dios lo utilizó para el bien (Génesis 50:20). Dios es tan grande que nada ocurre sin Su permiso, y a través de tal permiso Su plan definitivo se desarrolla.

lywRBk4Kaa	Almost any proof of afterlife given to any person in any way, shape or form, would surely prove God's existence rather than disprove it.  That said, rely on your faith as your foundation for your beliefs; not an experience.

Their purpose is to sway us from God and convince us God's word is a lie.  Faith in the Lord can fix all things.  We only must believe.  A true Christian would of accepted the fact her daughter was possessed by a demon(which others called a ghost) and she would of ordered it out in the name of Jesus Christ.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Nonsense.|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	Ghost or demons?

Thus, it shows to me that the husband had more faith in the monk than God Himself.<br>  Even the devil comes masquerading as an angel of light.<br>  <br>  Deliverance is more the "showing a cross and Bible."  The demons believe in God, and they tremble.  <br>  My faith would not have failed.

Ultimately, the husband is not responsible for his wife's spiritual well being.|`|AA12205301	It wouldn't have been a ghost. It would have been a demon.  Yes I believe in demons all around us. Did you know that satan and the demons must answer to God also?  Did you know that they do nothing that God doesn't give them permission to do?  Did you know that in order for them to possess someone or even be around that God has to allow it to happen?  Each and every one of us has demons around us and in us. There are many categories of demons, not just the bad ones. If God allows them to stay, then they stay.  If God allows it, then even prayer will not get rid of them until He tells them to go.  Yes we can cast them out or rebuke satan, but if God allows them to remain they will remain. No this story doesn't affect my faith. Because I know what true faith from God is, not the version that the churches are teaching.  Did you know that the faith churches are teaching isn't even what God means about faith?  Did you know that the grace the churches are teaching, isn't what true grace is by God's definition?  These are just some of the misunderstandings and untruths are that the churches are teaching.  And it is going to cause many "faithfull" people to not be let into heaven.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	Those of The True Christian Faith know that the souls of departed mortals do not communicate in any way with this mortal world... however... we also know that the forces of evil can mimic the departed very well... and that the forces of evil can, and do, possess humans... the ONLY way a true demon can be driven out(they can leave of their own will) is through the intercession of one of The True Church with The Full Authority of God... Only those with God's Full Authority and His protection are safe against such demons... No one of The True Church(The True Christian Faith) may be possessed by any demon... <br>  <br>  The Roman catholic is not The True Church... and very few of the Catholics are of The True Christian Faith... do not rely on any "priest" to deal with the forces of evil... There are no priests in The True Church

De tal modo, una conversación parecida a ésta se escuchó:<br>  Perdón, Virgen María, ?pero si voy al Cielo voy a poder jugar con el Ni?o Jesús?. La Virgen sonriendo contestó: "Sí, en el Cielo se te da todo lo que buscas con un corazón de ni?o". El peque?o prosiguió: ?Al fútbol también podré jugar con El?. La Virgen contestó: Si así lo deseáis... El ni?o: Ah, pero siempre va a ganar Jesús, porque El es el mejor, es Dios. La Virgen, llena de ternura, contestó: "No, mi amor, porque en el Cielo no hay competencia y mi Jesús siempre deja ganar…". A lo que el ni?o, poniéndose a llorar respondió: "Entonces yo no quiero ganar, sólo quiero ser como Jesús...".<br>  ?Qué lección la de la Madre de Dios!. Ella nos muestra la humildad y la ternura del Corazón de Su Hijo, que todo nos da, nos deja hasta querer ¨ganar¨ para que podamos aprender a ser como El, y ver que el Rey, todo Poder, trabaja en la peque?ez. ?Qué nos queda entonces a nosotros?.<br>  La Eucaristía ha brotado del Corazón de Jesús. Es el mayor regalo del Corazón de Jesús en la última Cena. La eucaristía tiene su centro en el amor, y el amor proviene del corazón.<br>  <br>  En la Eucaristía se encuentra palpitante el Corazón de Cristo, que ama intensamente al Padre y a los redimidos por su muerte y resurrección. La eucaristía es el corazón vigilante, atento y amoroso de Jesús, que nos ve, escucha, atiende, espera, ama, consuela, anima y alimenta.<br>  <br>  La gran promesa: “A quienes comulguen nueve primeros viernes de mes seguidos, mi Corazón no los abandonará en el último momento”.<br>  <br>  Todas las revelaciones a Santa Margarita María de Alacoque, la devota del Sagrado Corazón, a la que Jesús encomendó esta devoción, se las concedió el Se?or en la capilla, en la eucaristía. Es más, Santa Margarita vivía ansiosa de la eucaristía.<br>  <br>  Estas son sus palabras: “Mi más grande alegría de dejar el mundo era pensar que podría comulgar a menudo, ya que no se me permitía sino de vez en cuando. Yo me habría considerado la más dichosa del mundo si lo hubiera podido hacer frecuentemente y poder pasar muchas noches sola delante del Santo Sacramento de la Eucaristía. Me sentía ante él absolutamente segura, que aún siendo miedosísima, ni me acordaba del miedo, estando en el lugar de mis mayores delicias. La víspera de comulgar me sentía abismada en un profundo silencio y no podía hablar sino haciéndome violencia, pensando en la grandeza de lo que había de acontecer al día siguiente. Y cuando ya había comulgado, no hubiera querido ni beber, ni comer, ni hablar de tanta paz y consuelo como sentía. Me ocultaba lo más posible para aprender a amar a mi Bien Soberano, que tan fuertemente me obligaba a devolverle amor por amor”.<br>  <br>  Y cuando entró al Convento de la Visitación, a los 23 a?os, su madre priora le dijo: “Hija, id a poneros delante de Nuestro Se?or en la Eucaristía como una tela preparada delante de un pintor”. Y Santa Margarita no entendió, pero no se atrevió a preguntarle a su superiora. Pero escuchó dentro de ella “Ven, hija, Yo te lo ense?aré”. Era Jesús, que la invitaba a la eucaristía para ense?arle todo. Para Margarita María, el Sagrario era su refugio ordinario. ?Y sabemos cómo sufrió en vida esta gran santa!<br>  <br>  El corazón, sabemos, tiene dos movimientos: Sístole, contracción del músculo cardíaco que provoca la circulación de la sangre, y diástole, movimiento de dilatación del corazón y arterias.<br>  También el Corazón de Cristo tiene estos dos movimientos.<br>  <br>  # Sístole: se contrae, se recoge para unirnos a él, a su amistad, provocando en nosotros la circulación de la sangre espiritual que él nos ha inyectado. Nos alimenta, nos nutre, y esto lo hace desde la eucaristía, en la eucaristía. Esta contracción del Corazón de Cristo es una invitación a su amistad, a formar el grupo de sus íntimos. Es la invitación a acercarnos a la eucaristía, a disfrutar de su amor, a conocer sus secretos más íntimos. ?Qué bienaventurados aquellos que tienen la suerte de ser arropados en ese movimiento de sístole o contracción del Corazón dulcísimo de Cristo!<br>  <br>  # Diástole: Es la dilatación de ese Corazón de Jesús, que se abre a todos, sin excepción, con el anhelo de hacer llegar a todos su sangre preciosísima, que con una sola gota de ella salva a quienes se dejan lavar por ella. Este movimiento de diástole quiere abrazar a todos, y por eso se sirve de nosotros para que vayamos al apostolado y llevemos su amor para atraerlos a su Divino Corazón.<br>  <br>  La eucaristía nos invita a nosotros a estos dos movimientos:<br>  <br>  # Sístole: a acudir con más frecuencia a la eucaristía, a entrar dentro de ese Corazón Sacratísimo de Jesús, escuchar sus latidos de amor, sus gemidos de dolor, sus anhelos de salvar a la humanidad. A entrar, a intimar con él, consolarlo, animarlo, repararlo, y al mismo tiempo a contarle nuestros problemas, angustias y proyectos.<br>  <br>  # Diástole: es decir, a salir de la eucaristía con la sonrisa en los labios, con el amor en el corazón, con la servicialidad en las manos, con la prontitud en los pies y hacer llegar esos latidos del Corazón de Jesús que nosotros hemos escuchado en nuestros momentos de intimidad.|`|Vn7Rshl1aa	representa billetes para la iglesia zangana y para mi... marear a los que buscan su terrenito en el paraiso  PORQUE NADIE CREE EN DIOS SIN INTERES TODOS BUSCAN ALGO A CAMBIO y cualquier jalada que les inventen sus lideres zanganos se la creen.|`|bhyjLajiaa	respeto|`|d81ae76614e188ba948d492d99552663aa	Es muy milagroso, yo le pedi que escogiera para mi un esposo bueno y decente y me lo concedio.

Los griegos tienen cuatro palabras que se traducen por la sola palabra espa?ola “amor.” La primera palabra griega es eros y se refiere al amor romántico... el amor entre los sexos. La segunda es storgé, que es el amor entre los miembros de la familia. La tercera es filía que se refiere al cari?o que se siente por los amigos. Y la cuarta es agape, un amor basado en principios más bien que en emoción o egoísmo.<br>  Jesús y los escritores bíblicos del primer siglo elevaron el amor a un nivel más alto que la simple atracción entre los sexos. Entendían la atracción natural del amor romántico. Bien sabían que el amor romántico estaba logrando su propósito de llenar gran parte de la Tierra con seres humanos. Por eso, bajo inspiración divina, aquellos escritores de la Biblia dieron importancia al amor agape. Aun cuando el tema que trataban era el amor en el matrimonio, invariablemente usaban la palabra agape. En su vida matrimonial los cristianos habrían de manifestar amor agape.—Efe. 5:25; Col. 3:19.<br>  La obra Palabras Griegas del Nuevo Testamento por William Barclay, versión castellana de Javier-José Marín C., contrasta la palabra agape con las otras palabras griegas que significan amor al decir de éstas: “Son palabras que se refieren al corazón,” mientras que “agape tiene que ver con la mente.” En su definición de agape dice que es “un principio por el cual vivimos deliberadamente?.?.?. se relaciona íntimamente con la voluntad?.?.?. es una deliberada convicción que resulta en una deliberada norma de vida.” De modo que es amor basado en principios y tiene que ver principalmente con la mente, no?con las emociones de uno. Puede incluir o no?afecto y cari?o. No?es insensible y frío. No?obstante, el sentimiento no?lo rige, sino que es guiado o gobernado por principios, como por ejemplo, en el mandamiento de Jesús de continuar “amando a sus enemigos.” (Mat. 5:44)|`|3jaE4gAAaa	muy buena pregunta, espero poder ayudarte...<br>  <br>  mira, el caso de todos los tipos de amor se centra en el único y verdadero amor.<br>  <br>  Aquel q solo se siente y da vida, q no se puede explicar q ahí está viéndote, el que hace q lata tu corazón, el q mueve a las estrellas... el Amor de Dios.

Los cristianos no estamos obligados a una tradición y sentimos al mundo y a su gente como jesucristo los sintió: hermanos a quienes amar y respetar. No penséis que eso significa que debamos hacer sacrificios estúpidos para amar a quien nos odia o ataca. Amamos, toleramos y respetamos hasta los límites de nuestra dignidad.

BwdN1rDIaa	El escepticismo y el ateísmo no son comparables en lo más mínimo, voy a decir porqué<br>  <br>  El escéptico no es que no crea en nada, es que pone en duda las aseveraciones del otro, por ejemplo: <br>  <br>  yo -esto es rojo<br>  esceptico - ?y porque estas tan seguro que es rojo?<br>  yo - Porque tengo la percepción de rojo<br>  escéptico - Pero pepe tiene la percepción de verde, entonces ?por que dices que es rojo?<br>  yo - Porque pepe tiene un fallo en la vista<br>  esceptico - ese fallo en la vista tambien lo tiene lola y carlos, entonces tu rojo no es rojo para ellos.<br>  yo - no lo és<br>  esceptico - por tanto necesitarias que alguien más tuviere percepcion de rojo<br>  yo - pues camila y manolo lo tienen<br>  esceptico - pero camila y manolo usan gafas<br>  <br>  y así sucesivamente, dudando del otro mas no negando.<br>  <br>  El ateismo es no creer en Dios ?cierto? pues entonces el ateismo comienza negando la existencia de algo, pero ese algo no puede existir si no se han tenido, por un lado percepciones sensoriales y por el otro datos cientificos.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a las percepciones sensoriales la sensacion de Dios es propia del humano, pero ese Dios no necesariamente es un Dios "creador" o "cristiano", sino simplemente un ente que controla muchos (o todos) los aspectos de la naturaleza, ese control no se dá de forma directa, ese control se dá de forma indirecta, influenciado por nuestras decisiones. ?cómo podemos sentir ese control? Pues muy facil, en cuestiones como la amistad o el amor, ese lazo invisible que une a las dos personas es dicho enten, no necesito explayarme mucho aqui, puesto que todos hemos sentido aquella sensacion extra?a junto a nuestros amigos (de verdad) o nuestra pareja.<br>  <br>  Entonces Dios aqui ya no es un creador, sino un ente que ordena el mundo y de cuyo conocimiento lo tenemos por la experiencia. Si dudaramos de Dios, le estamos dando entonces realidad "no hay nada en la conciencia que no haya entrado por los sentidos". El ateo niega a Dios pero esa negacion es en sí una afirmacion. Si digo "los unicornios no existen" estoy negando la existencia física de los unicornios, pero acepto que son personajes fantasiosos que existen en la imaginacion. Total, existen pero en cierta forma.<br>  <br>  Ahora con lo de dios, pues simplemente pasa lo mismo, decimos que dios no existe, pero ese "no existe" va al mundo real, físico. En el plano de la conciencia no pasa lo mismo, en el plano de la conciencia pensamos y aceptamos que dios es un producto de la imaginacion (cuando lo pensamos tambien lo imaginamos) y por tanto le damos existencia en el plano metafisico...<br>  <br>  Ya no sigo con esto porque me dió pereza, sue?o y me sali del tema, pero demostré que el ateismo no es lo mismo que el escepticismo y que no se pueden combinar en esa peque?a pregunta|`|7MTWNlOfaa	Yo soy ateo, creo en lo que existe. lo que no existe no va para mi.

La fe es la negación de la razón y el ateísmo formal, es esencialmente racional.<br>  He se?alado al ateísmo formal, ya que hay seres que indican ser ateos, para contrariar a sus preceptores o por "estar a una moda".<br>  Así que el ateísmo es escéptico, en cuanto a la denominación del escepticismo como una manifestación de la racionalidad.|`|Oi7AlzXjaa	bueno pues te dire ke soy ateo y al igual ke mai, creo ke tampoco me puse de acuerdo con tu dios cuando yo creia en el, pues yo fui seminarista, casi llege al ser un sarcerdote, por cuestiones ke no kiero mencionar aki tuve ke salir de la iglesia, y pues mi interes por seguir mas aun la religion me llevaron asta donde estoy ahora, creo ke el saver demaciado hacerca de la religion es lo ke te hace cambiar pues en ningun lado encuentras una respuesta a las preguntas ke tu mismo te hacer hacerca de dios. <br>  <br>  ahora de ser ecepticos pues creo ke si y no, pues al igual ke mai, yo tambien e visto el cielo y el infierno, al igual en sue?os, e visto como los mismo angeles me an llevado al cielo, y en otro como ellos mismos me ence?aron el infierno, en el cual no se por ke motivos tuve una pelea con unos de los angeles ke me llevaba, lol pero pues bueno, eceptico no significa simplemente, por ke no ves no crees, pues al igual sientes el amor, pero pues no lo puedes ver, sientes el frio y tampoco puedes ver el aire ke hace ke tengas frio, o el aire ke respiramos. creo ke entiendes a la idea ke estoy tratando de poner, bueno esa es mi opinion espero ke la haceptes.|`|e6f560806cc974fe966c8fce90265cadaa	pues creo que yo si, si no esta ahi la prueba entonces no creo <br>  yo si me fijaba de bajo de la cama para ver si estaba chucky o el coco y no habia nada, en tonces deje de creer en lo que no existia o no habia prueba de su existencia|`|yTU9vkAOaa	MIRA, LOS ATEOS SON ATEOS JUSTAMENTE POR SER "ESCéPTICOS".

"Por que si pecaramos deliberadamente después de haber recibido el conocmiento de la verdad, ya no queda más sacrificio que la horrenda expectación de juicio" (Heb. 10:26)   Entonces pues siempre tenemos que estar en continua comunicación con Dios para no caer en tentación, cuando esta llegue estemos fuertes en lo espiritual y vender el pecado.<br>  Por otro lado hay pecados que "nos son ocultos", los que hacemos en ocasiones sin darnos cuenta, como ofender a un hermano.  Por eso cuando ores, ora a Dios pidiendole perdón por aquellos que te son ocultos.<br>  Saludos.

viqFWweqaa	Hai pienamente ragione..<br>  Lui veramente ci chiama a se mille volte. Ma quante volte noi rispondiamo?... Ho conosciuto nella mia vita persone di ogni estrazione sociale e di ogni razza, ho domandato spesso a loro nei momenti di relax, cosa ne pensano di Dio e della chiesa. loro mi hanno risposto sempre educatamente e con gran rispetto che loro si erano fatti le loro idee su questo argomento e che mi ha detto che Dio era la cosa più importante per loro, chi mi ha detto che per loro il loro Dio era un'altro dio, sempre nel rispetto più assoluto...<br>  venendo ai giorni nostri, da quando mi sono iscritto ad ANSWERS e spulciando nell' argomento "religione e spiritualità" ho notato che ci sono persone che oltre a non credere in nulla offendono e bestemmiano spudoratamente. Ciò non è assolutamente bello se si considera che answers e nato per scrivere e comunicare attraverso una specie di forum, non per inveire contro questo o quello...<br>  insomma voglio dire c'è sicuramente un modo diverso per intendersi in questo mondo molto variegato di persone che la pensano diversamente..<br>  quello che più mi sorprende è il modo nel quale certi argomenti vengono affrontati, spesso hanno sapore di provocazione più che di semplice curiosità.<br>  Tuto quello che hai scritto trasuda di profonda conoscenza  del mistero di Dio e del suo immenso amore per tutti noi senza distinguo alcuno. Io ersonalmente stò vivendo un'esperienza di conversione e pago sulla mia pelle tutti i miei errori, Dio mi fa sentire la ua presenza anche mentre lavoro e soprattutto mi fa sentire la sua mancanza quando per un pò abbandono la sua strada per seguire qualcos'altro.

KlUhB9OBaa	forse certe cose le fai senza accorgertene..ma io  ci credo ai fenomeni paranormali... da quando è morto mio nonno io sento una sorta di presenza accanto a me.. e molto spesso lo sogno.. lo sento vicino a me che mi fa compagnia.. a volte ne ho paura a volte sono tranquilla..|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	5 minuti fa no....ma dopo che ho visto il mouse muoversi da solo.....sì.....aiuto!!!!!!!¨non é uno scherzo....|`|ac516986fcd32fad6647af7bac9bf405aa	€si nnexmi creo quando dico che li ho visti pure io.....ah|`|gocKt9XEaa	mia mamma crede molto in Santa Rita..una volta siamo andati a san marino e in chiesa c'era la statua grande della santa..ho fatto 2 foto e quando le ho ritirate dal fotografo ho notato che erano diverse: in una la statua della santa ha gli occhi bianchi (come tutte le statue) e nell'altra ce li ha neri (quasi come se fossero aperti). <br>  Poi un'altra volta io e mia mamma eravamo in sala, solo noi due, con la finestra socchiusa, ad un certo punto si è sentito un fortissimo odore di rose (quando era in vita, Santa Rita aveva sempre delle rose in giardino, durante tutte le stagioni), io ho cominciato a fare il giro della casa e dei balconi, magari era un odore che veniva da fuori, invece c'era solamente vicino al divano, dove c'eravamo noi.|`|TtC6n6wUaa	Io invece quando tiro fuori una cosa poi non la trovo +!!!

Pensa: con qualche strana alchimia, ogni mese, a me sparisce metà del mio guadagno. Sospetto la presenza di qualche fantasma di stato... Ma non saprei.<br>  <br>  Seriamente... Io non ci credo. Il nostro cervello è talmente complesso che è impossibile riuscire a capirlo. Così si può scoprire come cose apparentemente inspiegabili sono spiegabili da fatti normali.<br>  Ti faccio un esempio: stamattina mi sono alzato dalla scrivania, ho messo in tasca il portafogli per andare a prendere un caffè, mi sono ri-seduto per 30 secondi, sono andato a prendere il caffè e il portafogli era sparito. Non mi si era avvicinato nessuno e non era per terra.<br>  Sono tornato alla scrivania ed era lì.<br>  Nessun mistero: il mio cervello, tra i suoi automatismi, ha quello di togliere il portafogli quando mi siedo a lavorare. Quindi, quando mi sono ri-seduto, ho tolto il portafogli senza che l'azione venisse registrata.<br>  La quantità di cose automatiche che facciamo durante il giorno... Quella si che fa paura.|`|8d703337aee9435014dfaae831b2f989aa	io credo che siano tutti scherzi della mente o della memoria.|`|43c74cf27f89a4cc03b7cf5cde313349aa	Fai bene a non temere gli spiriti perche' dei morti non bisogna aver paura ma dei vivi.
MYN4VFJvaa	it's ok as long as it fulfills the following conditions:<br>  <br>  1. Clothing must cover the entire body, only the hands and face may remain visible (According to some Fiqh Schools) .<br>  <br>  2. The material must not be so thin that one can see through it.<br>  <br>  3. The clothing must hang loose so that the shape / form of the body is not apparent.<br>  <br>  4. The female clothing must not resemble the man's clothing.<br>  <br>  5. The design of the clothing must not resemble the clothing of the non believing women.<br>  <br>  6. The design must not consist of bold designs which attract attention.<br>  <br>  7.

Jeans is not necessarily haram, after doing some personal thinking, i think it's ok for the colder climates like the UK. Here the weather is always cold and rainy. Wearing loose dresses, say a long gown will not save one from cold, but then again i am NOT advocating mini skirts for the summer, there should be a minimum standard to modesty. I mean i see people dressing very modestly in the winter time, then in the summer. You as a muslimah and the an Islamic 'fashion prodigy' :P know exactly what I mean. :))<br>  --<br>  As said, as long as the dress indeed for covering oneself, and is modest, its ok.|`|Izn1ye9Raa	Techically pants are a form of clothing worn by Kuffar, and they are a clothing worn by men.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Chinita por que muchos se meten a participar en esta sección de Religión y Espiritualidad por que para ellos es más fácil ofender y discriminar y hacer preguntas y respuestas DESTRUCTIVAS y ganar puntos de esa manera, que dar respuestas y preguntas concretas de por que lo de sus ideologías.<br>  <br>   NO SABEN RESPETAR las creencias de los demás. Cada quien con su forma de creer o de ser. Y siempre nos dicen que somos nosotros quienes no damos respuestas concretas  y son ellos, si haces un sondeo te podras dar cuenta de sus respuestas o preguntas, todas es criticando destructivamente y ofendiendo, diciendonos borregos, ignorantes, etc. Algo que yo nunca he hecho con ninguno de ofenderlos de esa manera.<br>  <br>  Deberían aprender a VIVIR Y DEJAR VIVIR y sobre todo aprender a respetar y participar sanamente.

La historia de la relación con Dios (de cada uno de nosotros) es una historia de encantos y desencantos, emociones y descepciones, fíjate en la Biblia, hay momentos en que Dios le procura muchas luces y esperanzas a sus amados y de la noche a la ma?ana se las quita y parece que los odiara, pero no es asì, cuando Dios deja de darnos luces es para que no nos hagamos orgullosos de las que nos daba antes y también para que nos pongamos a trabajar. Pienso que eso es lo que le ocurrió a la madre Teresa, que Dios en toda su sabiduría le "dejó de hablar" para que hiciera su gran misión de ayudar a los pobres, si la madre teresa hubiera comprendido a Dios tanto como hubiera querido le habría pasado lo que a Santo Tomás, que un día simplemente se quedó sin habla y solo dijo "no es expresable". <br>  Este fenómeno de devotos que derrepente pierden la fe pero no abandonan la iglesia es algo conocido, santa teresa lo llama "los inviernos" otros le dicen "las soledades", una Sierva de Dios llamada Concepción Cabrera, en una de sus cartas escribe "Antes me hablaba siempre y ahora parece que jamás nos conocimos" pero no debemos nosotros por eso desanimarnos, debemos tomar ese tiempo de desolación como un momento de trabajo, retiro, de voltear a la tierra y ponerse a hacer algo, Dios, con el tiempo volverá.<br>  Lo de que debemos pènsar con las cartas de la madre teresa, es su increible templanza y su increible fé ciega pues aunque dudaba de la existencia, dudaba del amor, jamás se alejó y jamás dejó de servir a los demás. Imitemosla y cuando nos encontremos en ese momento solo pensemos en que volverá, aunque parezca que no y aunque no tenga más fé, el volverá, nos abrazará y nos recompenzará por nuestra espera.

Antes yo oraba,  "Dios, si hay un Dios" porque no sabia si era real o no.  Pero empecé a buscar información y leí un libro acerca de porque, las razones por las que un numero de científicos y personas muy inteligentes creían en Dios.  Eso me convenció un poquito.  Pero lo que verdaderamente me convenció fue cuando comencé a estudiar la Biblia y pude ver que una tercera parte de ella es profecía y  que estas  se hicieron hace mas de dos siglos y que casi todas se han cumplido.  Que de hecho lo único que falta que se cumpla es la profecía de su venida. No me queda mas camino que creer en El, ya que si todas se han cumplido menos esa ( y le tercera parte de las profecías bíblicas se han cumplido), por que, esa, no se va a cumplir también. Y si creo en su venida tengo que creer en El, en mi Dios y en mi Jesús.  En todo lo que la Biblia me dice de Dios.|`|5iOSKMwQaa	No solo es normal, es deseable y necesario, quien no ha dudado no puede ser un creyente convencido. <br>  <br>  Mi opinión de la Madre Teresa, es muy alta, yo creo que sus dudas vinieron de lo que veía cotidianamente y se preguntaba, ?Cómo es que dios permite esto?|`|8c38bb22061fe64857f2e6fa2f4ca0abaa	La Madre Teresa contribuyo mucho para acallar las conciencia de los poderosos fabricante de esa miseria. <br>  Tu me diras: Si este duda de la hermana Teresa puede dudar de Dios.

42bf1e8d080df9a80b8dee93137fbe19aa	Ci sono tanti motivi per cui le persone perdono la fede e non credo piu` in Dio.<br>  <br>  Uno e` la mancanza di accurata conoscenza della Bibbia. Essendo ispirata da Dio, la Bibbia è opera dello spirito di Dio. (2?Timoteo 3:16,?17; 2?Samuele 23:2) Non studiandola si impedisce che si sviluppi una vera fede. Benché membri delle chiese possano avere la Bibbia, se sono state insegnate loro idee di uomini anziché quelle della Parola di Dio, non avranno vera fede in Dio e nel suo proposito. Per risolvere i problemi della vita saranno inclini a fare affidamento sulle loro proprie idee e su quelle di altri uomini. Confronta Matteo 15:3-9.<br>  <br>  Un' altro e` che molti sono stati delusi dall’ipocrisia delle chiese della cristianità, le quali asseriscono di insegnare la Parola di Dio ma non vivono in armonia con ciò che essa dice. Altri appartenevano a una religione non cristiana, ma hanno visto i cattivi risultati delle sue pratiche o hanno riscontrato che le loro credenze non li aiutavano veramente a risolvere i problemi della vita. Non avendo accurata conoscenza della Parola di Dio, queste persone si allontanano da tutto ciò che ha a che fare con la religione.?Confronta Romani 3:3,?4; Matteo 7:21-23.<br>  <br>  Un' altro movito e` che la maggioranza delle persone non comprende perché Dio permette la malvagità, per cui lo incolpano di tutte le cose cattive che accadono. Non si rendono conto che l’uomo è incline al male non a causa della volontà di Dio ma a causa del peccato di Adamo. (Romani 5:12) Forse non sono consapevoli dell’esistenza di Satana il Diavolo e dell’influenza che esercita sugli affari del mondo, per cui attribuiscono a Dio le indegnità perpetrate da Satana. (1?Giovanni 5:19; Rivelazione 12:12) Se in qualche misura ne sono consapevoli, possono pensare che Dio sia lento nell’agire, giacché non capiscono chiaramente la contesa della sovranità universale e non comprendono che l’aver Dio esercitato pazienza fino ad ora permette loro di avere un’immeritata opportunità di salvezza. (Romani 2:4; 2?Pietro 3:9) Inoltre, non si rendono pienamente conto che Dio ha stabilito un tempo in cui distruggerà per sempre tutti quelli che praticano il male. Rivelazione 22:10-12; 11:18; Abacuc 2:3.<br>  <br>  Oppure perche` sono alla ricerca di altri interessi. Alcune possono dire di credere nella Bibbia, ma forse non l’hanno mai studiata a fondo oppure non hanno meditato con apprezzamento sulle informazioni che hanno letto, sulle ragioni d’esse e su come applicarle nella vita di ogni giorno. (Confronta 1?Cronache 28:9). In alcuni casi non hanno alimentato la fede che avevano, ma hanno lasciato che il desiderio di cose ingiuste dominasse l’inclinazione del loro cuore così che si sono allontanate da Dio e dalle sue vie.?Ebrei 3:12.<br>  <br>  Romani 10:17 dice che “La fede segue ciò che si ode”. <br>  Quindi se non udiamo la Parola di Dio come possiamo poi credere?<br>  <br>  Ciao|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	troppa corruzione al mondo d'oggi|`|bd9e0d5ccfe3e84dce8532cb323823e2aa	io direi: "Come mai alcune persone non credono più in Dio?".<br>  Io vedo, frequento e conosco una miriade di persone che credono in Dio, quanto qui in Angola come in altre nazioni in cui ho vissuto, compresa l'Italia.<br>  Ciao e buona vita|`|hxTjZS3daa	+ k non credere + in dio la gente non crede a quello che viene detto su dio, su quello che ci dice la chiesa<br>  come può la chiesa sapere il volere di dio e predicarlo al mondo? come mai le popolazioni + povere e meno istruite (vedi africa, sudamerica...) credono in dio e nei paesi + ricchi e sviluppati dove la gente può farsi un opinione su quelo k le viene detto + precisa i fedeli sono sempre di meno?<br>  io personalemnte credo che qualcosa esista, non sò dirti se è un dio, una sostanza creatrice o qualcos'altro; solo non è quello a cui vuole farci credere la chiesa, che per secoli ci ha ingannato con le sue bugie fatte per mantenere l'ordine e il controllo (credi davvero alle scritture, ai santi, ai miracoli? come mai adesso che le comunicazioni sono molto + sviluppate e qst notizie si potrebbero trasmettere con molta + velocità e precisione non succede + niente? t pare un caso?)|`|w9tCkXRIaa	Chi te lo ha detto ?

As time went on, the central government became bigger and more powerful and with that a national identity solidified.  A small example of this is seen in Thomas Jefferson's book "I Tremble For My Country".  By "country", he exclusively and explicitly means his State of Virginia, not the USA.  <br>  <br>  No proper "specific" name was given to the US because the states were protective and self-serving, there was little desire for a dominant common culture or central identity to form.  Eventually that happened, and so the term "America" now has a new layer of meaning that can be easily determined vis-à-vis context. <br>  <br>  Consider this: As late as 1900, the federal budget of the US accounted for little over 1% of total GDP (compared to present-day, roughly 1/4 the total GDP).  State governments were supreme, the USA was insignificant, merely there to facilitate trade and protect the markets from outside invaders.<br>  <br>  Historical and political ignorance are what drive the "USA, the arrogant empire" explanation for the use of shorthand "America" and demonym "American".  Notice that the educated Swiss are not crying imperialism over EU nationals using "Europe" as shorthand for The EU.

Donc, la langue d'oc est l'ensemble de dialectes parlés du Limousin aux Alpes; on l'appelle aussi, à la suite des linguistes modernes, l'occitan. A la différence du fran?ais, qui a cessé de s'écrire dans ses dialectes à la fin du Moyen-Age, la langue d'oc a toujours été écrite selon ses dialectes propres: les troubadours écrivaient principalement en dialecte limousin aux XII° et XIII°s, les poètes de la cour de Nérac, autour des rois de Navarre au XVI°s, en gascon, et les Félibres, avec Frédéric Mistral, en proven?al au XIX°s. Il existe encore aujourd'hui des écrivains en cette langue, mais je ne les connais pas. <br>  <br>  Voici un extrait d'une prière cathare du XIV°s, dictée aux Inquisiteurs du Languedoc (la région) par un de leurs détenus: "Payre sant, Dieu dreyturier de bons sperits, qui hanc no falhist, ni mentist, ni errest, ni duptest, per paor de mort a pendre al mon de deu estranh, , car nos no em del mon ni-l mon no es de nos, dona nos a conoiscer so que tu conoishes et amar so que tu amas." En fran?ais: "Père saint, Dieu droit des bons esprits, toi qui jamais ne te trompas, ni ne mentis, n'erras, ni ne doutas, de peur que nous n'éprouvions la mort dans le monde étranger à Dieu, puisque nous ne sommes pas de ce monde et que le monde n'est pas de nous, donne-nous de conna?tre ce que tu connais et d'aimer ce que tu aimes."

4B2vn8Mnaa	El dejá vu es el resultado de unas conexiones cerebrales que pasan en el momento mismo que estás experimentando la sensación. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|wKg26wGJaa	El término déjà vu (/de?a vy/, en francés ‘ya visto’) o paramnesia describe la experiencia de sentir que se ha sido testigo o se ha experimentado previamente una situación nueva. Este término fue acu?ado por el investigador psíquico francés émile Boirac (1851-1917) en su libro L'Avenir des sciences psychiques (‘El futuro de las ciencias psíquicas’), basado en un ensayo que escribió mientras estudiaba en la Universidad de Chicago. La experiencia del déjà vu suele ir acompa?ada por una convincente sensación de familiaridad y también por una sensación de ?sobrecogimiento?, ?extra?eza? o ?rareza?. La experiencia ?previa? es con frecuencia atribuida a un sue?o, aunque en algunos casos se da una firme sensación de que la experiencia ?ocurrió auténticamente? en el pasado.<br>  La experiencia de déjà vu parece ser muy común. En estudios formales, el 70% o más de la población afirma haberlo experimentado al menos una vez. También se encuentran referencias a la experiencia de déjà vu en literatura del pasado, lo que indica que no es un fenómeno nuevo. Ha sido extremadamente difícil invocar la experiencia del déjà vu en el laboratorio, por lo que se han realizado pocos estudios empíricos. Recientemente los investigadores han hallado formas de recrear esta sensación usando hipnosis.|`|POoApdCFaa	La mente nos esta enga?ando en un deja vu. en el numero de Mayo de la revista Muy Interesante, que se publica en Argentina, lo explica muy bien.|`|QIKEQ6Uvaa	Existe una ley cósmica llamada "Ley de recurrencia", según la cual los sucesos de esta vida muchas veces son idénticos a los de una vida anterior, por lo que al sucedernos algo muchas veces nos queda la sensación de que ya lo habiamos vivido, pero no fue en esta, sino en otra vida. <br>  También se da este fenómeno porque cuando estamos so?ando, en ocaciones podemos ver lo que puede pasar en los días próximos (Porque en el plano astral se pueden ver esas cosas), pero al despertar no lo recordamos y, como esos recuerdos se van quedando en el subconciente, cuando nos pasan las cosas solo nos queda la sensación de que ya lo habiamos vivido, pero no podemos recordar en donde.|`|ab78b69c4b50fa58ec6987d5514b494faa	En una imagen que ves, un haz de luz se repite de una imagen ya vista, entonces en parte recordas eso que logras ver pero no sabes lo q es y te parecio haber la imagen completa, cuando solo una fracción de "fotograma" fue el que viste antes, no toda la imagen.|`|mS6jbnTDaa	yo lo explique diciendo como que fue una experiencia que ya has vivido.... tu cerebro enseguida manda el recuerdo como que vos a eso ya lo viviste antes en un pasado<br>  a mi me pasa bastante seguido.. es mas me ha pasado un deja vu de 3 veces... es decir... me paso, mas adelante vino el deja vu y mas adelante otra vez mas y me acorde que eso fue un deja vu ya pasado!!!!!tu ve un deja vu de un deja vu... raro no? pero 100 %real

Esto se hace ofreciendo "pruebas" físicas o lógicas y tratando de llegar a una conclusión lógicamente convincente. <br>  <br>  Cuando el ateo le pide al teísta que presente su evidencia, la evidencia es insuficiente para concluir que existe un dios, sin importar cómo se defina "dios".

adabbd4e519788a50336a5f7dc3b7565aa	back when the English and french invaded and colonized Africa, in the areas of the local tribes, many african leaders had slaves (usually it was a punishment) anyway, when the white people came, many african tribe leaders used their slaves to trade with the white people.

Also a lot of the looking down was because at that time, the Africans had very little technology compared to the Europeans.|`|WBwlKbLeaa	They are not enslaved anymore, its been a long time, let it go.|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Are u trying to be funny because u are not|`|L8yKZ1TRaa	Because your greedy, devil ancestor's need people to pick their tobacco, and sugar cane fields.

pUF71f1laa	I know this is going to sound tough but here goes. I would make a clean break from both of them. At least for 3 or 4 months. When you are ready to stand on your own 2 feet and feel good about who you are and where you are going in life, do I think you should invite someone else in your life. Sounds like it's time to grow up alittle and leave this Life Sucking Drama Behind You!|`|fdMKpXCHaa	First, it's too late for her not to get hurt.  The only things you can do now is not make it worse.  Set her down and tell her the truth.  Make it clear and concise.  Tell her you're done and why.  Don't make it about the other guy.  It's not.  You've grown apart.  And for god's sake, stop telling her that you don't mean it afterwards.  That's confusing to her.  After you tell her make sure not to send her any mixed signals.  She'll be looking for them.  She's likely to think you'll come back again and say you didn't mean it, so it may take a while to get through.  Good luck.|`|764563e236641925edbeefe032c813b3aa	You don't wanna hurt her so you're willing to hurt yourself for her benefit. Who does that help? Certainly not you.. and it wouldn't help her either because she wouldn't have the total you as either a friend or a boyfriend because it wouldn't be there. <br>  <br>  You can't live your life the way someone else thinks you should. If your heart isn't with her romantically, there is no point in you continuing on with a relationship with her. That's unfair to both of you. I agree that it wouldn't be wise to break up with her to be with someone else but as long as your reasons are genuine, the fact that you'd be free to date other people (whomever you chose) is a side effect. <br>  <br>  Also, if she knows you're bisexual and would still think that she had something to do with turning you gay, then you don't need her anyway because she would NEVER understand you. You guys could never be in a ltr. I don't even know if there's a such thing as turning someone gay. Either you're gay or not. Even with someone bringing it out of you, they didn't put it there so they aren't and can't be responsible.|`|DkVofG9paa	oh no, that sounds tough! you have to live for yourself, so you have to break up with her if you are truely not happy.  You can still be friends and offer to hangout and whatnot.  good luck.|`|GmTMVmASaa	you cannot delay your life, simply to avoid hurting her.<br>  what she thinks is irrevellent, in comparison to your happiness.|`|3RQkgTSOaa	Relationships go through their bad patches and dry spells. First: have you TOLD her how you feel about the criticism and negativity she's contributing to the relationship? (Don't call it nagging...) Sometimes people aren't aware of what they're doing and what effect that has on others around them. If you want to FIX this relationship, then you need to start having open and frank conversations about where you expect it to go, what you're feeling (both good and bad) and COMMUNICATING with one another. Complaining, being moody, and not talking because you feel badly is NOT communicating. While she might get defensive about your feeling that "she's always dragging you down," they ARE your feelings and if she wants those to change, BOTH of you need to change your behavior. Yes, there will be minor tiffs but as long as your both have COMPLETE FAITH in one another that you are looking out for one another's welfare and well-being, the small stuff fades away.<br>  <br>  Now, if this is NOT the case, then it's time to cut your losses and call it quits. It's natural that she'll want to cry about it and that you'll want to stop that pain (no one likes hurting someone they love.) HOWEVER, staying in the relationship just to spare her feelings and the reality of the situation is not fair to her or you.<br>  <br>  Her lack of friends is not your fault or responsibility. If she is the same way with her friends as she is with you ("dragging them down") then there's a REASON why she doesn't have many friends.<br>  <br>  The sex of the person you're leaving her for is inconsequential. Would it be any different if you were leaving her for another female? O_o?<br>  <br>  Pain and ecstasy, hurt and love are two sides of the same coin. You can't love without the risk of hurt. That's a given. Being hurt and being loved are lessons in life that we ALL must experience and learn from. They make us better people to appreciate that which we have and be sympathetic to those who have lost something dear to their heart.<br>  <br>  You may want to take this in a couple of steps: (1) break up, (2) remain single for a while (3) date your gay friend. The reason I say this is that jumping immediately from one partner to the next is bound to add insult to her injury (especially if she's going to freak out that it's a guy). The "staying single for a while" will send the message that it wasn't SOMEONE ELSE that was the catalyst for your break-up but will give more credence to your conviction that you have simply grown apart and you need to re-adjust your relationship compass and THEN move on. Resist impulses to speak/communicate with her if she insists on trying to win you back; chances are you will both fall back into the old behavioral patterns.<br>  <br>  After enough time has passed and you've both moved on, perhaps you will have gained a new-found perspective on what you had and what you COULD have just as friends.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ROVhLgH7aa	Like my parents told, never ever date someone out of pity. if this girl is wearing you down almost all the time, then why hang on to it. Apparently, the relationship ran its course which wasnt a good one and if this guy is still available and you guys like each other still, then I say go for it and stop thinking og how to break up with the whinning girlfriend of yours. Just break up with her by saying this is not working anymore and you both cant be unhappy in such situation. Yeah she is gonna whine more or whatever but seriously, is your happiness not that important to you anymore?|`|eKeWnkguaa	just tell her your really sorry and that you don't want to go out with her but just say you still really want to be friends with her and then go out with this guy and follow your heart|`|nyeYS0Seaa	go out with him. follow your heart.|`|8PA58u3kaa	That is quite a dilemma, and your concern for her feelings is well founded however if you truly don't see the relationship going anywhere positive, you HAVE to break it off. Prolonging a dead relationship will only make the both of you more and more miserable and prevent you from being with whoever it is the two of you should REALLY be with. Do it gently, do gracefully, and do it discretely, but DO IT. It's the only way. Before you go out with the other guy though, I would definitely make sure you search your feelings very thoroughly as that could potentially be a whole new can of worms.<br>  <br>  Good luck ^_^|`|Ub8arVLpaa	Well, no matter what you tell her she will most likely be hurt.  I know it sounds cruel, but be honest.  I was there myself and wasn't totally honest with my partner about a breakup.  There were problems in the relationship, and of course when we broke up, there was a man coming around, it looked as though I did it for him.  Do what's best for you.  Even if this man enters your life as a partner, it really ok.  If your not completely honest now she may find out later and be more hurt.  Good luck.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	You just need to talk to her about it.<br>  If you dont tell her how you feel you will just end up bottling it up and you will resent you eventually.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could be with both...<br>  Be completely open about it and see how they feel about the situation. You never know, they may be into it.<br>  <br>  Either way, they only thing you can do is be completely honest with your gf.  If she really really loves you then she will understand and respect how you feel.<br>  Make sure she understands that no matter what you will always be there for her|`|soNHKzK2aa	grow some balls and break up with her properly. yes she'll be sad so try to do it nicely but don't back out! she has to accept that if one person doesn't want to be in the relationship anymore she can't force it. i'd maybe leave it a couple weeks before getting with ur guy mate so she doens't feel as much like you broke up with her to be with him.|`|zxPffjSwaa	Word of advice, I wouldn't count on a relationship with the gay guy, especially if he identifies as gay. Men are much more rigid in their sexuality than women, if he says he's gay it's very unlikely that he would change his mind for you, regardless of what Tyra Banks says lol.<br>  <br>  I mean what advice would you give to a gay guy that wanted to break up with his partner to get with a str8 friend? Exactly.|`|JjVjekxgaa	It's time to think about yourself for a minute.  Your not feeling this girl anymore.  It's time for you to go.  Just a heads up no matter how you say it to her, her feelings will be hurt so just get it over with.  The faster you two are apart the shorter amount of time it's gonna take for you two to heal and besides that you already know what your next step is.  You did the girl thing for a while now try the guy thing.  And you don't have to jump into a relationship right away.  Being someones friend is always easier.  There are no strings attached and if you find someone else who catches your eye you can move on with little consequence.  Just make your you outline that in the beginning before you even make the transition it will hurt a lot less when you finally move on.  I hope this helps

A4IaSaaqaa	Let me try my best. :D<br>  <br>  * Alternation is a bit tough. I can't think of a direct translation.. Let me try to think of it first. :D<br>  <br>  This here is supposed to be an alternation to all my former [and further] love confessions.<br>  <br>  Ito dapat ang magsisilbing kahalili ng lahat ng aking nakalipas at magiging pagtatapat ng pag-ibig.<br>  <br>  *kahalili means alternate/substitute.

As someone’s translating this for me, I don’t wanna talk too much<br>  <br>  = Wala akong naiintindihan isa man sa mga salitang nakasulat dito ngunit alam kong naiintindihan mo ito at iyon ang mahalaga.

I promise, I’ll never let u down.<br>  = Baby, ipinapangako/pangako ko sa iyo, hindi kita bibiguin.<br>  <br>  I miss u badly and the only thing that keeps me up is the thought of us meeting soon..<br>  <br>  Formal:<br>  Labis na akong nangungulila sa iyo at ang tanging bagay na nagbibigay ng lakas sa akin ay ang kaalaman na malapit na tayong magkitang muli.<br>  <br>  Casual:<br>  Sobrang nami-miss na kita at ang tanging bagay na nagbibigay ng lakas sa akin ay ang kaalaman na malapit na tayong magkitang muli.<br>  <br>  * Nagbibigay ng lakas literally means something that gives strength but it's the closest thing that I can relate to 'keeps me up' since there is no direct translation for the phrase.<br>  <br>  Wanna use this opportunity and say, thank you! For everything..<br>  = Gusto kong samantalahin ang pagkakataong ito para sabihing salamat para sa lahat.<br>  <br>  * That's it.

Te ense?an como limpiarte tu mismo de esas  energías acumuladas.<br>  <br>  Somos energía y por ende nos agotamos o nos sobrecargamos de ellas. <br>  <br>  También podrías darte una ducha con sal marina, la compras en la farmacia o donde venden artículos naturales. Te duchas y dices una oración o le pides a tu ángel de la guarda que sea el quien te limpie tu cuerpo de toda mala energía que tengas encima.<br>  <br>  Haz deportes, camina, sube monta?as, en fin con eso desintoxicas tu organismo también. Siempre donde hay naturaleza es conveniente para eliminar energías acumuladas, también puedes abrazar a un árbol por un rato y ahí el árbol te transmite energía de la naturaleza y tu dejas en el árbol las negativas ya que él por estar plantado en la tierra y la lluvia que le cae, solito se limpia. <br>  <br>  Ojo hago yoga y he leido algo de eso, por eso te doy mi opinión al respecto.<br>   <br>  UNA COSA ES CREER EN DIOS Y SU HIJO JESúS, Y OTRA DIFERENTE HABLAR DE CHAKRAS, ALGO QUE EXISTE Y ES ENERGIA ACUMULADA, CLARO PRIMERO ESTA EL AMOR DE DIOS QUIEN LIMPIA NUESTRA ALMA, PERO NOSOTROS TAMBIéN PODEMOS AYUDARNOS CON LA NATURALEZA LA CUAL FUE CREADA POR éL.

El ser humano cuenta con Siete Puntos Energéticos Básicos, a través estos siete puntos energéticos, el Cuerpo Astral le da energía al cuerpo físico, definiéndole las diversas facetas de su salud y su destino.<br>  <br>      Estos siete puntos han sido denominados con diferentes nombres a través de las culturas y la épocas, su referencia esotérica mas citada les concede el nombre de Chacras según la influencia orientalista de los últimos siglos, mientras que su referencia científica los ha descubierto como Glándulas Endocrinas.<br>  <br>      Esta alimentación energética tiene que estar compensada en el ser humano con la respiración y la comida, que son los pilares del mantenimiento del ser vivo.<br>  <br>  Según los "bioenergéticos", adeptos a la “Medicina Alternativa”, las chacras son receptores para diferentes tipos de energía, situados en lugares específicos o "meridianos" del cuerpo humano.  Entre los tratamientos que pretenden estimular estos chacras o receptores están la homeopatía (medicina con plantas), la acupuntura (tradicional china o electrónica).<br>  <br>  ?Que hay de cierto?<br>  Hay que distinguir entre lo natural y lo sobrenatural. La buena medicina puede curar el cuerpo y hacernos sentir mejor, pero no puede sanar el alma. La medicina alternativa, sea con plantas o terapia puede ser valiosa dentro del campo natural. Este potencial se debe investigar y probar por medio de estudios imparciales para evitar los frecuentes fraudes. Estos estudios corresponden a la ciencia.<br>  <br>  Pero es un error creer que las plantas, los cristales, las pirámides u otros objetos tengan poderes mágicos o espirituales. El alma solo la sana Dios por medio de la gracia. Nadie ni nada puede remplazar a Cristo. En el mercado esotérico de la Nueva Era se encuentran también cuarzos, pirámides, budas, la Cruz de Caravaca  (?la verdadera no tiene nada que ver con estas prácticas!>>>, la espada del ángel, el ángel solar dorado, la Estrella de David, el dragón rojo, el unicornio o pulseras de plata, oro y bronce.<br>  <br>  Lo esotérico puede utilizar referencias naturales verdaderas, pero las lleva a falsas conclusiones. Por ejemplo, es cierto que existen puntos vitales en el cuerpo (Ej. El corazón). Pero no por eso se puede concluir que por estos puntos el Cuerpo Astral da energía al cuerpo físico, o que por ellos se define el destino y muchos otros mitos.<br>  <br>  Es particularmente peligrosa la intervención sobre la mente. Evite la manipulación de su mente que puede ocurrir por medio del uso de mensajes subliminales, sesiones de hipnosis, meditaciones con palabras desconocidas, poner la mente en vació, luces y otras practicas de la Nueva Era.|`|7KJHONNxaa	Las emociones provienen de la mente y de la conciencia.

Si sabes donde están localizadadas, haces el gesto de limpieza, tal como lo entiendas tú, y echas la energía negativa en el agua fría en la que has metido sal. Lo mejor sería hacerlo en el lavabo. Se hace cada noche antes de ir  dormir. Cuando el agua se elimina del lavabo, tienes que decir en tu mente las palabras: "que las energías negativas vuelvan al centro de la tierra de donde han salido y que nunca más vuelvan a mi".

Pienso que si dos chicas se besan estando en un sitio público, la gente se escandalizaría. Mucho. Pero, en los medios sí es bastante más común ver mujeres besarse que a dos chicos. Las relaciones lésbicas son parte "normal" de la parafernalia porno dirigida a varones; además de que recientemente parece que están de moda las chicas bisexuales (ojo, bisexuales, que no lesbianas) o que no tienen problemas en tocarse o besarse con sus amigas (Madonna besando a la Spears, por ejemplo, el grupo ruso tATu). Pero en nuestra cultura occidental, esas manifestaciones pseudo lésbicas son aceptadas y "toleradas" siempre y cuando sean de juego, un juego dirigido a excitar varones. Y eso no es tolerancia.|`|00e7fc9901d23e5fd9b0c851971b0479aa	a mi me da igual, hay que tener la mente abierta, cada quien escoje la sexualidad que quiere tener!<br>  cada quien que haga de su **** una cometa!|`|0573b1fb8b9443cc6f2690ae8fea901baa	Por que si te fijas, las mujeres tienen más permiso social para ser más afectuosas y más cercanas unas con otras, tu puedes ver a dos mujeres muy cari?osas la una con la otra, tocándose y piensas que son amigas cercanas, las mujeres entre nosotras nos saludamos de beso... aquí en Latinoamérica como no se usa que los hombres lo hagan, pues es chocante.. los hombres entre si se comportan más distantes, yo creo que eso por eso.|`|1747cc43fb735925b289f514aad9793baa	Ja es exitante ver a tu novia besando a su mejor amiga ò a la tuya je!

Por ejemplo...?no sería fascinante ver besandose a ROBBIE WILLIAMS con COLIN FARRELL?<br>  Es mi fantasia, bueno...estar en la mitad.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|8i8plf3Gaa	en la calle es mentira que toleres eso y te lo dice una experta en el tema, se te acercan se?oras, se?ores, monjas, sacerdotes a quererte llevar a lugares equis para quitarte tal enfermedad y cuando ven a un hombre es mas permitido, pero si lo dices como hombre entonces lo toleras mas porque para ustedes es mas fantasioso ver a dos chavas y no a dos chavos porque su homofobia no les permite fantasear con dos hombres, cosa que a las mujeres bugas o lesbianas si podemos hacer.<br>  pero contestando lo q dice tu pregunta, lo toleras porque las mujeres permitimos que eso pase y a veces nos escondemos o no nos exhibimos para que no nos j o d a.n con ese asunto|`|KFgO9WGpaa	Es sencillo...La mujer esta reprimida sexualmente debido a los siglos de machismo y negacion del deseo sexual femenino. Si ves bien es comun entre dos chicos que hablen de pornografia, de masturbacion etc con la mayor naturalidad; mientras si dos chicas lo hacen es extra?o, vulgar e incluso inmoral (aun en nuestros dias). La razon por la que dos chicos aceptan que les gusta ver a dos chicas besandose es porque su sexualidad no esta reprimida, mientras que la mayoria de las chicas te responderan que no sienten nada por mas liberadas que se crean.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo esta demostrado que tanto hombres como mujeres disfrutan de un beso entre parejas del sexo opuesto y tambien te aseguro que a todas las chicas nos gusta un beso entre dos chicos. [Las que te digan que no ... 1. Estan reprimidas 2.Aun no conocen su sexualidad 3.Son homofobicas]<br>  <br>  ^^<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|bifVfwITaa	ES UNA EDUCACION MACHISTA!!!<br>  <br>  PERO HAY MUJERES QUE SE LES HACE CACHONDO VER A DOS HOMBRES BESANDOSE!!!|`|cdij54Slaa	Creo que San Lolo ha dado en el clavo. Estar en el medio, eso es lo que hace "tolerar" esas situaciones.<br>  <br>  El hombre heterosexual se imagina entre las dos mujeres, o reemplazando a una de ellas, y se excita. Sin embargo, ese mismo hombre hetero nunca estaría cómodo si estuviese entre dos hombres o en el lugar de alguno de ellos.<br>  <br>  Hay mujeres heterosexuales a las que excita pensar o ver a dos hombres besándose. Sin embargo, creo que eso es mucho menos frecuente, por el machismo del que han hablado anteriormente y porque la mujer suele ser menos promíscua que el hombre.<br>  <br>  Entre homosexuales la situación es idéntica, aunque es el hombre quien gusta de ver a dos chicos besándose y la mujer a dos chicas.<br>  <br>  Todo depende, en última instancia, de la capacidad de fantasear de cada uno y de sus tendencias. Ten por seguro que más de una persona que dice "qué asco" interiormente se mueve en otro plano.|`|ponBZ2y4aa	Pues por estupidez de prejuicios adquiridos, por que es igual, bueno depende, si es un beso tierno, o apasionado, o dulce, hay hasta suspiro, no importa el género, por que el amor es el amor, y es digno de contemplación, pero si ya es un atascón de babas, que se están aspirando hasta las amígdalas, pues wacala para los dos casos...<br>  <br>  Un amigo me dijo una vez que es un asunto de las feromonas, y coincide con un artículo que leí en una ocasión en que decía que las feromonas femeninas son agradables incluso para las mujeres, por lo que atraen a los hombres y a las mujeres, pero las masculinas atraen a las mujeres pero en ciertos casos repelen a los hombres y cuando hay más de un espécimen segregando feromonas pueden hasta chocar con todos, será???... dos artículos distintos de dos revistas distintas, puede que tengan razón, pero si yo me hallara en un cuarto con 20 chicos, lejos de sentirme asqueada, me sentiría diosa!!!!<br>  <br>  Suerte y besos|`|wgQwpYmiaa	Pues la verdad es una muy buena pregunta a la que no le puedo averiguar una obvia respuesta|`|yRbWp018aa	facil! <br>  pss es por que muchas personas  consideran como algo placentero y sexy ver a dos chicas besandoce es algo muy  muy caliente jejejeje<br>  para algunas personas<br>  es por eso<br>  de echo es muy comun ver k un chavo hetero tenga en su cel  unas tipas besandoce, puesto que alimenta su sexualidad jejejeje<br>  depende de la mente humana<br>  :)<br>  y sus depravaciones|`|BvQ9ZTFwaa	Porque ?qué más sublime puede haber que dos bellezas dándose amor y cari?o?

Lo mismo en las esculturas o también en las películas... si sacan la cuenta, estoy segura de que en sus vidas conocen y admiran más las curvas femeninas que esas simples lineas rectas masculinas...<br>  Así mismo, es más sensual, sexy, erótico, estético (y todo lo que quieran agregar) ver a dos mujeres besandose, tocarse, admirarse que a dos hombres...|`|fekVYpEEaa	Para los "Machos" que se excitan por ver 2 mujeres besarse y decir que está bien: entonces no sería lo mismo que ver a dos hombres besarse?<br>  <br>  También estaría bien no?...<br>  <br>  Si dicen que ver 2 hombres besarse es aberrante y antinatural, entonces también lo es que 2 viejas se den no?<br>  <br>  Sean coherentes!!|`|mQ5Ne2H6aa	Lo que dices es cierto incluso hay hombres que no les importa si su chica tiene relaciones con otra mujer, pero en mi opinion personal se ven mejor dos chicas juntas que dos chicos, saludos chau.

Ma se fossimo più sicuri in noi stessi ci renderemmo conto che l'altra persona ha scelto proprio noi e se sta con noi e non con qualcunaltro un motivo ci sarà pure!<br>  ... poi ovviamente ci sono le gelosie motivate, ma quelli sono altri casi!|`|2BuIRozmaa	quando si ama una persona... un minimo i gelosia c 'è.....è un po la paura di poterla perdere....paura che un altra persona ce la porti via.....<br>  ma quando diventa una cosa morbosa....non è piu amore...ma possessione...e puo diventare anche una malattia.....<br>  <br>  un bacio|`|9YwsyzpKaa	per me no! penso invece che sia solo insicurezza ,e egoismo l'amore è fiducia !|`|9d5uEo6Taa	Per me più che indicare amore indica la tua insicurezza sul tuo valore e su quello che pensi provi l altro per te. Ama incodizionatamente e lascia vivere che la gelosia fa morire tutti i germogli|`|9e08b93effdcf77a68bf078d73719fc8aa	Per me lo è..chiaramente deve essere una gelosia " pulita", non ossessione, o possessione....<br>  la gelosia ti fa capire che l'altro tiene davvero a te...|`|11HXH256aa	è il principale|`|440eb186a66600a000507a7e1c105ad8aa	sì, ma non è l'unico|`|4549c5ea73fa553d0378e8131dd8bc03aa	Assolutamente no!<br>  La gelosia la si associa alla possessività e sono cose diverse dall' amore. é vero comunque che un pizzico di gelosia nell' amore ci sta, ma deve essere veramente un pizzico altrimenti il rapporto d' amore rischia di rompersi!!!!|`|CPuJJ2eIaa	sì potrebbe anche...ma potrebbe anche essere il contrario....perché significa che non ci si fida del proprio amore!|`|e0f619ddee84b2a4300be1519859c48eaa	no, dell'insicurezza|`|e764d26cf5e486f4166cc6e49ecec5aeaa	Secondo me sì, l'importante è che non diventi ossessiva..<br>  io sono gelosa e lo sono perchè m'importa veramente del ragazzo che mi piace.. però in fondo indica anche un pò di insicurezza..|`|uSwUEBgqaa	Sì e no. Mi spiego meglio: se ami davvero una persona, credo sia naturale temere che qualcun altro possa allontanarla da te. Quindi un po' di gelosia è normale.<br>  Ma se la gelosia ti porta a voler tenere quella persona solo per te, come se fosse una tua proprietà, impedendole di vedere gli amici, di andare al lavoro, di uscire da sola per andare in palestra o al cinema, allora non è certo amore. E' voglia di possesso. Ma una persona non si può possedere. L'amore vero è il reciproco donarsi all'altro: io ti amo e voglio stare con te, tu mi ami e vuoi stare con me. Liberamente e senza costrizioni.<br>  Ciao!|`|z4tvjuBHaa	No ,come indicatore dell'insicurezza.|`|2Ds6o6LMaa	Non proprio... quando si pronuncia la parola l'amore nella mente si scaturisce qualcosa di piacevole...mentre pronunciare la parola gelosia.... bhe non mi  fa pensare a nulla di buono... quindi non puo essere un indicatore dell'amore|`|2KgZyhc9aa	certamente, purchè contenuta....<br>  normalmente se un ragazzo è geloso di una ragazza (o viceversa) vuol dire che prova qualcosa nei suoi confronti...|`|4OyEDxelaa	No. La gelosia è soprattutto sintomo di possesso, di egoismo, secondo me, con l'amore c'entra ben poco...ciao.|`|60seaVASaa	a mio parere no: in amore ci vuole fiducia e rispetto, e la gelosia esula da questi 2 fondamentali concetti.|`|7f180938dcde9ad17ee82e78225c7521aa	Come un indicatore dello stato di salute dell'amore: più la gelosia è ossessiva e più l'amore è vicino alla fine.|`|BmQ2qSDVaa	no! non è la gelosia che esprime l'amore!   si può amare tanto e non essere ossessivi!|`|CW9Pq0X5aa	Si ma quando è eccessiva è pesante sostenere il rapporto. Dev'essere nei limiti.|`|JfVdKaUnaa	certo!<br>  anche se troppa diventa desiderio di possesso e non va bene!:)|`|KaRy4NTEaa	Credo prorpio di si, parlo io che sono la persona più gelosa di questo mondo|`|Nta4GoZdaa	non puo essere a mio parere considerato come indicatore dell'amore... ho visto persone che ormai non erano più interessate al proprio partner tanto da cercarne altri, eppure rimenerne gelosi, una sorta di desiderio ossessivo di possesso a ogni costo|`|XBhebeDAaa	Dipende...la troppo gelosia non è amore...ma è solo possessività!! Però almeno un minimo ci vuole...|`|de2acCoFaa	Dipende..se è normale gelosia indica sicuramente un interesse verso l'altro ma se diventa ossessionante e patologica indica solo un disturbo psichico.<br>  Attenzione che spesso la gelosia non è attaccamento all'altro ma paura di perdere qualcosa che reputi tuo...quindi non è proiezione sull'altro ma su se stessi!!
AA10488602	Women are providing a lot of new ideas that are transforming society. They are becoming the more educated and skilled gender. I think that soon they will work their way up into top leadership positions. The world could benefit from female leadership.<br>  <br>  Yahoo news recently ran a story about how women are now more in charge at home. Last week the New York Times had an article about women out-earning men by a wide margin in major cities like New York, LA, Chicago, Dallas, Boston etc. So many statistics show how women are surpassing men in this new century.<br>  <br>  I think that women have an aptitude for leading, organizing and directing things. That may be their new role.

It is a great opportunity to witness to others because alot of people come up to us during the day and ask us what we were doing out there.

nvm0CGEkaa	Da bambina venivo emarginata perchè ero un "maschiaccio"!  Per il fatto poi che amavo giocare a calcio sono stata riempita di botte dai ragazzi. <br>  Ricordo che alle medie la mia classe faceva ginnastica con un'altra sezione. Nell'altra classe appunto c'era un ragazzo visibilmente omosessuale. Lo deridevano tutti platealmente. Io davvero non sapevo cosa pensare. Sapevo solo che era un'ingiustizia anche perchè la subivo anch'io, pur non associando la questione all'omofobia ma alla cattiveria in generale. Ricordo solo l'oppressione che provavo per lui e l'assoluta indifferenza mista al compiacimento della prof. di ginnastica. Una volta diventata grande ho capito ed ora ho la maturità per reagire e per non dare alcun peso alla questione. Ma da piccola ho vissuto un inferno perchè come mi mostravo non piaceva a nessuno. Poi non capivo davvero chi fossi. Forse è per questo motivo che l'unico giudizio che mi interessa ora è quello del datore di lavoro solo perchè mi paga. MA degli altri ME NE FREGO.  La scuola non è luogo di crescita nè educativo ma un posto dove si fagocitano notizie e numeri. Agli insegnanti spesso non interessano le dinamiche di classe. La storia di Torino è una delle migliaia che ci sono nel mondo. L'unico consiglio che posso dare è di non ascoltare o fare come ho fatto io. Ho preso uno della mia classe. L'ho rincorso prendendolo a calci nel Ku..lo. Quando mi ha chiesto scusa gli ho detto: "D'ora in poi se in classe qualcuno mi offende vengo a prendere te. " NON MI HANNO + deriso!!!|`|5c938d9c798b412e18d4542659c626aaaa	Mi dispiace per tutti quelli che soffrono in questo momento,ma non mi ricordo scene violente o di derisione ai miei tempi,si qualche bulletto ma finiva li tre secondi o forse meno,posso solo dire che la scuola e stato il periodo piu bello della mia vita....e mi sono pentita tantissima volte di non essere andata all'università,adesso sto sentendo cose per allucinanti,potevo capirle (e nemmeno tanto) nel periodo che frequentavo la scuola io,nessuno sapeva molto sull'argomento,ma adesso....la gente e veramente idiota e menefreghista..in bocca al lupo per tutto.....|`|CeXNxNl6aa	a scuola per me è stata dura, molto. Fortunatamente però il periodo peggiore è stato solo quello delle scuole medie, almeno per quanto riguarda le botte che mi davano spesso. In quei tre anni ogni giorno mi picchiavano perché ero per loro troppo timido e se non mi picchiavano mi rompevano la riga e la squadra di educazione tecnica e mi rubavano i quaderni strappandoli. E' andata avanti così per tre anni che non finivano più.<br>  alle superiori ho frequentato il liceo linguistico e qui al bullismo si è sostituito un ambiente di fannulloni in cui i professori fumavano in classe, i compagni (quasi tutte ragazze tranne un maschio) erano più o meno meschini tranne un paio di ragazze molto in gamba. <br>  Le aule erano buie e umide. Sono stati 5 anni duri, dovevo studiare tutto da solo per le materie orali e mi facevo aiutare a leggere le decine di libri che ci davano ogni mese per fare diverse relazioni.<br>  Spesso i professori andavano a simpatie. Le secchione, in latino, avevano la versione più semplice, quelli con più difficoltà la più difficile. Io ero nel mezzo. A parte queste due ragazze che potevo considerare delle amiche, il resto mi ignorava e devo dire che è molto meglio essere ignorato piuttosto che prendere le botte quasi tutti i giorni.<br>  Il bullismo era una realtà quando ho fatto le medie, in quel lontano 1985, e lo è ancora oggi. E ancora oggi che ho quasi 33 anni, ho gli incubi la notte, mi sogno le angherie subite nelle medie, gli anni tristi delle superiori e quei ricordi sono ancora vividi.<br>  finite le superiori ho frequentato l'università. I miei compagni di giochi di quando ero piccolo hanno cambiato quasi tutti casa e sono spariti, le strade si sono separate. Ora, dopo essermi laureato, tento di lavorare ma non è facile lavorare oggi. <br>  Se un domani dovessi avere un figlio non saprei cosa dirgli riguardo la scuola, l'istruzione, il bullismo...<br>  io penso di aver imparato molto più da solo che a scuola. Ho compreso fin da piccolo che la scuola è un luogo angusto in cui si è costretti a trascorrere la parte migliore della vita semi reclusi tutti i giorni per 13 anni! <br>  E in confronto a molti altri a me è andata di lusso. Diciamo che è stata quasi comoda. Ci sono molti ragazzi che ho conosciuto nel corso degli anni che sono stati trattati decisamente peggio.<br>  tutto sommato non voglio neanche lamentarmi troppo, vi racconto solo quanto possa essere dura la vista scolastica.<br>  alle elementari ho imparato a scrivere e a fare le operazioni da mia nonna in pensione; alle medie e alle superiori da mia madre. A scuola non ho imparato nulla tranne una cosa: la mancanza totale di giustizia quando vieni etichettato come un diverso.|`|S47qMqYZaa	ciao io non ho il tuo stesso problema....Ma c'è mio zio che quando andava a scuola venive sempre preso in giro dai suoi compagni per come si muoveva, per come parlava...Mia madre ogni volta che lo vedeva tornare a casa triste ci rimaneva molto male per lui...Ma adesso conduce una vita normale con un compagno...Non preoccuparti.|`|f884415667d80523dbef22df01969975aa	io ho sempre difeso a scuola il mio migliore amico poichè gay.. alla fine l'hanno lasciato in pace ma solo xkè convinti che stessimo assieme.. a volte ripenso a quelle volte in cui uscivamo assieme e.. dei ragazzi facevano proprio gli stupidi.. lui però continuava la sua vita tranquillamente x questo ho sempre avuto una grande stima x lui.. ora purtroppo nn posso stargli accanto come vorrei ma spero che certa gente abbia imparato a stare zitta piuttosto che ferire inutilmente..|`|I710aLn6aa	Io non sono mai stata veramente vittima della discriminazione a scuola, se non per semplici episodi in cui mi si diceva "oh ma oggi sembri proprio un maschio!" oppure "ma perchè hai la foto di una ragazza sul banco e sul diario?"...

Ese Dr. es especialista en Vidas Pasadas. <br>  <br>  Por eso existe lo llamado deja′vu es decir recuerdos vagos de vidas pasadas, por ejemplo, cuando conoces a una persona  y sientes que la conoces desde hace mucho tiempo, tienes afinidad inmediatamente etc, es posible que en otra vida esa persona fue algo tuyo, un novio, una hermana, etc. Otro ejemplo, cuando de repente piensas que ese momento ya lo habias vivido, o si viajas a un sitio donde nunca habias estado y sientes que lo conoces, eso es deja′vu o recuerdo de vidas pasadas.<br>  <br>  Cuando uno muere, reencarna en otro cuerpo, es decir en el nacimiento de un bebe y ya de grande es que empiezas a tener esos recuerdos de vidas pasadas, son recuerdos leves que a veces uno ni se explica de porque suceden. También existe el karma, es decir situaciones de vidas pasadas que no solucionamos y en otra vida la pagamos o tenemos que resolver. <br>  <br>  El alma a medida que va reencarnando  se va elevando y adquiriendo más conocimiento.

Las religiones organizadas mantienen a sus adeptos con una venda intelectual. En Sindioses.org estamos convencidos que solo podemos acercarnos a la verdad si cuestionamos todas las creencias sin excepción y hacemos grandes esfuerzos en buscar evidencias para que cualquier afirmación sea aceptada.<br>  <br>  Los efectos nocivos de las religiones organizadas son muchos. Por ejemplo:<br>  <br>  Muchos jóvenes adventistas del séptimo día ven limitadas sus posibilidades de realizar estudios universitarios porque se les ense?a que es pecado asistir a clases en sábado. <br>  Muchos jóvenes testigos de Jehová malgastan sus vidas trabajando en las "casas de Betel" para mantener el negocio editorial de la Watch Tower. <br>  El Vaticano, en cabeza del Papa católico Juan Pablo II, de forma irresponsable se opone al uso de anticonceptivos, ya que según él, los actos sexuales solo deben estar destinados a la reproducción. <br>  Este mismo personaje se opone a que los estados establezcan una legislación que permita las uniones de homosexuales en una interpretación medieval sobre el erotismo y el afecto, con lo cual el Vaticano favorece y alienta la discriminación de gays y lesbianas. <br>  Otro caso de discriminación está dado por los brahmanes, los líderes del hinduismo, los cuales favorecen la discriminación de miles de hindúes de las castas inferiores, al considerar que son impuros de nacimiento y que "su karma es malo". <br>  Cientos de testigos de Jehová han dejado morir a familiares suyos por negarles una transfusión de sangre, mientras que otros grupos cristianos no consultan al médico porque creen que esto es desconfiar del poder de Dios. <br>  Los fundamentas islámicos dictan sentencias de muerte (fatwa) a quienes no piensan como ellos, además de negar los derechos más básicos a las mujeres. <br>  Los bautistas del sur de EEUU fueron uno de los grupos que defendieron el mantenimiento de la esclavitud argumentando que la Biblia sustentaba esta práctica por mandato y ejemplo (y no estaban equivocados). <br>  El antisemitismo fue sembrado muy bien en Europa gracias a los padres de la Iglesia Católica. <br>  Muchas religiones organizadas se han opuesto a la investigación científica, lo cual es otro efecto indeseable del fundamentalismo.

Pero con la gran evolucion de la ciencia, del conocimiento, etc veo la evolucion del hombre a medida q pasan los a?os con respecto hacia la religion, y si conoces algo del tema es presisamente ILUMINISMO como se le llama a este proceso de racionalizacion q el hombre hace, sin embargo creo q para darle una respuesta a tu pregunta, a mi criterio creo q los q creen en dios es porq encuentran en eso algo q de alguna forma los hace sentir mas seguros, como q sienten una especie de proteccion adicional para los problemas de la vida - es facil pensar q ante un problema le rezo a dios y el me soluciona los problemas-, cosa q no veo nada de malo en eso, pero es importante ser obejtivo y darse cuenta de los grandes errores q comete la iglesia y ver q no es nada bueno lo q hace si bien los ideales q promulga creo q puede q esten bien y sean correctos, pero la verdad es q creo q los mismos saserdotes son las personas mas alejadas de cumplir con lo q pregonan. Igual lo mio es simplemente una opinion, la diversidad de opiniones es lo q nos hace diferentes y diferenciables unos de otros, por eso es q cada uno es libre de pensar lo q quiera siempre y cuando no moleste al resto, ahh a proposito no soy ni satanica ni mucho menos ni me siento  superior agnostico paso a explicarte q el agnostico no es q niega ni no niega simplemente no cree, mas alla de si existe o no dios simplemente no cree en la existencia del mismo ni de ninguna "fuerza superior" y creo haber dado las razones de porq no creo, y no por eso me siento ni superioi intelectualmente, definitivamente no es por moda (jaja q desastre seria eso), ni por resentimiento y como dije anteriormente me parese q los ideales en los q se funda la iglesia estan bien organisados, por lo tanto si comparto el amor, creo q el amor no pasa por dios, es decir no necesito ir a una iglesia para saber q hay personas q necesitan ayuda, o q puedo hacer obras de bien porq eso nace de mi mismo sin necesidad de demostrarselo a nadie, porq no pasa por la imagen sino por la satisfaccion de poder ayudar al progimo, espero haberte ayudado en algo, suerte.|`|3866281ab82e617f39316b82fd6c80e1aa	Creen y quieren que los creyentes verdaderos dejen de creer, pero lamentablemente eso pasara......NUNCA<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bless...|`|6b0566a3ddfc04afd30b5822abb93fbeaa	Los ateos si pensamos, y actuamos, conocemos mucho mejor que todos los cristi-asnitos domingueros, el libro negro, que solo lo usan los domingos para llevarlo bajo el brazo, y nunca lo leen por eso se creen todo lo que les dice su titiritero,quien los maneja y les dice que ver, oir, decir, pensar, actuar,vestir etc.etc.Al menos yo  me volvi ateo simplemente leyendo las incoherencias y estupideces que tiene la biblia y que los creyentitos como tu comprenderas, creen que es la palabra de su diosito, <br>  Ponen su esperanza en un sueno de opio,pobres,los compadezco, pero no los critico, yo tambien fui  igual, sabias que yo fui cristi-asno?pero aprendi a pensar por mi mismo y a actuar si algo no andaba bien?|`|78TgIFKoaa	no... somos komo tus sacerdotes!! tratan de yevar la palabra de dios a todo mundo y asta se saben lo ke los ateos dicen... es practicamente lo mismo solo ke nuestro dios es  "la razon"|`|9cb254ee1b8cd527e43c49cabdf52e42aa	Te han contestado como les da la gana solo que ya debes tener la respuesta que satisfaga tu pregunta , ahora que triste es saber como el caso del reiniciado que por cierto lo bloquee , tiene una hijita y ese hecho debería ponerle las barbas en remojo , es excristiano eso significa que nunca lo fue , un verdadero cristiano no abandona su fé  bajo ninguna circunstancia .<br>  No cabe duda que muchos de los aquí presentes , se llevaran la triste noticia el día de el gran juicio , cuando  eso suceda ya no abrá solución ( pobres , pasar por esta vida y no creer ) vale amigo que nosotros los que si tenemos  amor por nuestro Dios   tendremos un mejor futuro ,para  nuestros decendientes (con darles el ejemplo , en nuestra fé y ense?arles que sí se puede con este mundo tan corrupto .|`|ALTUzYbvaa	Porque les da bronca que haya gente que crea en algo que no se puede probar con pruebas contundentes.<br>  Así como hay creyentes que les da bronca que no crean en lo que ellos si pueden creer.<br>  <br>  Conclusión : El hombre es muy vanidoso.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo una reflexión mía es:<br>  <br>  Si Dios es aquel ser en el que nada puede pensarse porque escapa a lo finito de la razón humana. Todo designio y voluntad divina que el hombre pueda discernir no puede ser cien por ciento fiel a como lo quiere ese Ser en el que nada puede pensarse. Por ende, ninguna religión puede adjudicarse que está en lo correcto simplemente porque la perfección de ese ser llegaría imperfectamente a nuestra vida por no poder abarcarla en su totalidad con nuestra mente.

Superiores en el sentido de que no nesesitamos creer en algo divino para tener una vida completa.

SjsGAq8Vaa	Hola Tarzán<br>  <br>  Si saliese bien librado de semejante tribulación, me sentiría agradecido con la vida y esperaría a que el tiempo y la ciencia den explicación a la solución que en un principio pareció milagrosa. <br>  <br>  La ciencia tiene sus limitaciones. Los límites de su conocimiento se amplían constantemente. Lo que es misterioso el día de hoy, ma?ana será perfectamente entendible en virtud de los nuevos descubrimientos. Ser ateo es una cuestión de principios... al igual que ser creyentes. Ninguno de los dos tiene respuestas para los grandes enigmas de la vida, y cada quien es feliz a su modo. No hay superioridad de uno sobre otro.<br>  <br>  Anta?o la ciencia no podía explicar el movimiento de los astros, y tampoco podía curar  un simple resfriado o tifoidea... es cuestión de evolucionar la investigación y el razonamiento... y la moralidad...<br>  <br>  saludetes.|`|efcokycLaa	Tarzan, es muy difícil que un ateo te responda que creerá en un ser supremo que lo ha ayudado en una situación tal, de todas manera hice una pregunta similar, y me contestaron casi lo mismo.<br>  No los juzgo, es su manera de pensar... sin embargo yo soy creyente desde el día que nací. ?porqué? porque cuando estaba en el vientre de mi madre los médicos les aconsejaron un aborto médico porque no saldría normal, mi padre hizo una promesa, iban a terminar con mi gestación y si salía normal me pondrían el nombre de la Virgen.<br>  Fue que cuando mi madre me tuvo fui completamente normal, no como los médicos habían dicho, ojo que fueron muchos análisis los que mi madre se hizo, fue practicamente un milagro.<br>  <br>  Es hasta cuando las cosas suceden que empiezan a creer.<br>  <br>  Saludos|`|vmmZ1jZIaa	ES MUY FACIL, MIRA HACE 50 A?OS LA GENTE SE PODIA MORIR  DE UNA DIARREA.<br>  (EN ESA EPOCA ESAS INFECCIONES ERAN MORTALES)<br>  AHORA ES UNA INFECCION COMUN CON LA QUE NO PASA NADA A MENOS DE QUE NO SE TRATE, Y NO ES DE MILAGRO ES GRACIAS A LA CIENCIA.<br>  ES LO MISMO SEGURAMENTE SI ME SALVO ES QUE EN ESOS MOMENTOS SE DESCUBRIO ALGUN MEDICAMENTO QUE HIZO LA CURA.<br>  GRACIAS A LA CIENCIA??????????????|`|0fcec073a3f7bddfb63fcef8684ce764aa	Creo que no le daría las gracias a nadie... o en última instancia agradecería a mi buena suerte.<br>  Sólo pensaría que hay un momento para nacer... y otro momento para morir y que, por quién sabe qué vericuetos de la vida la  muerte sólo me ha hecho una mueca...! jejejeje...<br>  Nota: no soy atea!<br>  Saludos<br>  Trinny|`|3866281ab82e617f39316b82fd6c80e1aa	No te diran que a Dios, pero algun dia si van a querer estar con El  seguirlo o haberlo seguido.<br>  <br>  Bless...|`|6BdWe8ZCaa	diria gracias dios!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! yo no se si dios existe y saberlo no me resulta importante.... si algun dia pasa eso agradeceria a dios pero seguiria en mi misma postura|`|96R1hxzoaa	Si hay dios, ese no hace milagros, solo manifiesta su voluntad por  leyes de la naturaleza, leyes que nunca contradice.<br>  <br>  ?Y si tienes una enfermedad terrible que dios no te cura y va la medicina y te la cura, a quien darás las gracias?. Seguramente a diosito, que nada te arregló, que fue quien te trajo la enfermedad. ?Todo antes que reconocerle algo a la ciencia!|`|A6nrcnHoaa	a la suerte... al destino... intentaria buscar la explicacion de lo ocurrido en vez de decir "ooh, un milagro divino"<br>  <br>  por?<br>  <br>  Acaso ustedes cuando son salvados por la ciencias medicas no le dan las gracias a dios? xD|`|Baamgs40aa	A Dios le doy gracias en todo.... buena pregunta....

No existe la casualidad, si la coincidencia. Si me sucede algo (de hecho me accidenté) y me salvo, todo debe tener su explicación terrenal. Su única explicación creo.<br>  <br>  Espero no ofender a nadie. Pero creo que los milagros no existen.<br>  <br>  ?Suerte!.<br>  <br>  Juan.<br>  <br>  Editado: Si pudiese darle más "Pulgares Arriba" a Facundo (más abajo) se los daría. ?Qué buena respuesta!. ???Grande Facundo!!!|`|KDqzGYL9aa	Al doctor porque los milagros no existen, aunque la ciencia no le haya encontrado una respuesta seguramente debio suceder por algo logico y exoplicable y no algo sobrenatural.|`|Mvd9d4LPaa	a la suerte ! al azar ?|`|Qjl6nPNzaa	Si tuviera que darle las gracias a algo sería las circunstancias y  extra?as, y la ayuda o intento de las personas, que hicieran que me recuperara de tal enfermedad o tal accidente, pero en realidad a nada ni a nadie, puesto que ocurren casos similares que son explicados por la ciencia.<br>  <br>  Además la ciencia no es infalible, la ciencia se equivoca, acepta sus errores y los corrige, mejora día a día, y entonces ocurriría un nuevo descubrimiento, esa enfermedad no es siempre mortal, surgirían investigaciones y después de cierto tiempo sabrían las causas de la "extra?a curación" y se podrían salvar muchas vidas, sin necesidad de decir "gracias a ese ente invisible omnipotente y omnipresente, todo amor", ja, si como no.|`|TqGTB1e0aa	El dia que suceda te respondo|`|YUhFgOtHaa	Por que demonios piensan que cuando estamos en problemas es cuando buscamos a dios???<br>  <br>  Dime, ?le pides piedad a Zeus en medio de una tormenta electrica?<br>  <br>  ?le rezas a santa claus cuando quieres comprar algo pero no tienes el dinero?<br>  <br>  ?Le pides milagros a cupido cuando quieres conquistar a alguien?|`|nnOGfnM7aa	La ciencia, como dios tiene incertidumbres.<br>  Ni lo uno, ni lo otro.<br>  Hay fronteras de la vida, que ni siquiera dios ha podido entrever.|`|uaPXSkrIaa	A los médicos, desde luego. Y a las personas que estuvieron a mi lado y me acompa?aron en esos momentos difíciles.<br>  <br>  Como dice el viejo dicho: "los milagros no existen, existen los tontos que creen en los milagros".<br>  <br>  Eso de que los ateos se vuelven creyentes cuando están gravemente enfermos o a punto de morir es una fantasía que tienen muchos creyentes. Quizás podría darse en algún ateo débil pero jamás en un ateo convencido.<br>  <br>  Sin embargo, la gran mayoría de los creyentes no pueden comprender que un ateo no necesita de ningún dios en ningún momento de su vida. Es incomprensible para ellos. No lo pueden entender.|`|02SLRjR0aa	a aquel ser supremo sea cual sea todos son  iguales y forman parte de la misma historia ya sea jeova,cristo, la virgen, jesus etc todos forman de la misma historia|`|1CWtwPGbaa	Tarzan no entiendo muy bien tu pregunta, pero te la voy a responder como me parece.<br>  Le daria las gracias a mi esposa, porque se que habria estado todo el tiempo a mi lado, le daria las gracias a mi madre, porque se que de otra manera sigue estando y me cuida; y le daria las gracias a los medicos, si considero que han hecho todo lo humanamente alcanzable, y le daria las gracias a Dios, por lo inexplicable.|`|63d3facbf9db66a8b0f5f9a093abaec6aa	no ammes no soy dios para responderte <br>  ups soy ateo <br>  creo que mi misma naturalesa|`|ITs0hAuBaa	no creo en los milagros por tanto si la ciencia no me puede salvar nadie mas lo hara, si me curo sera que mi enfermedad no era tan grave como aparentaba o que mi propio cuerpo lucho contra la enfermedad. Siempre hay una explicacion logica y razonable y no que un un se?or invisible y todopoderoso me haya tocado con su varita magica y me cure, eso no me lo creo. Pero si tu crees, como creyente, que esa si, me alegro por ti, pero un ateo siempre le encontrara la explciacion logica al asunto.|`|RGb3s1iEaa	yo creo q ami abuela|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Uno por ahí te dijo que a la naturaleza jejeje si lui como nie, jejejej por más que sus ojos vean la sanación nunca le darán las gracias a DIOS NI A JESúS. Ojalá nunca pasen por algo horrible en sus vidas para que vean la necesidad de pedirle a Dios que meta sus manos en su ayuda.<br>  <br>  Gracias a Dios mi madre se salvo de un accidente cerebro vascular, no le daban vida,es más mandaron a la familia a que arreglaramos todo lo del funeral y cual es la sorpresa que mi madre salio del coma, aún asi los médicos decian que no se salvaba que le darian 48 horas las cuales superó y de eso 10 a?os......los mismos médicos que es CIENCIA dijerón que era un milagro de Dios, ya que mi madre si se salvaba quedaría con algun defecto como ciega, etc. Y mi madre quedó totalmente sana. Como llamarian eso???? UN MILAGRO DE DIOS. <br>  <br>  Pero por más que vean esos milagros jamás entenderan el porque de eso?? de donde viene esa sanación, etc.<br>  <br>  Y al de arriba le digo, que los médicos tienen su parte y se les agradece, pero cuando la situación se escapa de sus manos es decir de la CIENCIA, ahí es donde está manifestada la mano y obra de DIOS, duelale a quien le duela.<br>  <br>  Y si te eliminan la pregunta es porque son unos intolerantes también, ellos si pueden hacer preguntas idio.tas como si creer en superman, etc. como una que vi por ahí y nosotros no se la eliminamos. Y después dicen que nosotros no somos tolerantes y son ellos...grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr|`|03e097e2af671c83e125a6234f288fadaa	Hay muchas cosas que HOY la ciéncia no puede explicar por que todavía le falta mucho conocimiento, pero que andando el tiempo se sabrán, como ya ha ocurrido en múltiples ocasiones.<br>  <br>  El querer calificar algo que no entendemos como "milagro" y, sobre todo, conformarse con esa explicación, paralizaría la investigación y la evolución humana, cosa que afortunadamente y en la mayoría de los casos no ocurre.<br>  <br>  Ahora podemos comprobar que, situaciones calificadas hace a?os como "milagrosas", tienen una base científica descubierta con posterioridad.<br>  <br>  Y va siendo hora de olvidar la leyenda atribuída a los ateos sobre que en su último momento apelan a algún dios. En unos casos, no pasa de ser una frase hecha que se utiliza por costumbre y en otros (la mayoría) ni siquiera se menciona. He tenido alguna experiéncia en ese sentido.<br>  <br>  Si eres creyente, actúa según tus normas y deja a los demás con sus ideas, sin tratar de llevarles a tu huerto.<br>  <br>  Paz.|`|cEIQgBydaa	A mi me pasó, le di las gracias al equipo de médicos que me salvaron, estuve a punto de morir y nada de que viera una luz blanca ni se me apareció nadie ni nada d esos cuentos urbanos, de hecho lo que recuerdo que vi antes de despertar de la anestesia y después de una operación que se extendió horas, fué una ecuación de cálculo diferencial, una integral o algo así.<br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|0pgk5ujTaa	a la naturaleza...aun asi, no soy ateoo|`|1d6fb64ccaa527e522d203d93790bee7aa	No le doy las gracias a nadie por algo que no se como ha ocurrido y por tanto quien, que, o como se ha provocado.

El principal problema es que no sabría si realmente fue obra de un dios o si simplemente fue, como sugieres, un fenómeno que es actualmente inexplicable (aunque no por ello sobrenatural).<br>  <br>  Creo que ese fue el error que cometieron los pueblos primitivos: etiquetar los fenómenos que eran inexplicables para ellos como "divinos". En lo personal creo que si realmente existieran dioses o demás seres sobrenaturales y poderosos, seguramente tendrían métodos muy superiores para demostrar su existencia, que simplemente depender de la incapacidad humana para explicar las cosas.

Dios sabe que nuestra naturaleza es así, lo importante es pedirle a Dios sabiduría para no dejarnos llevar por los impulsos. Tenemos una invitación a ser prontos para escuchar, lentos para responder y para airarnos. Muchas veces producto de las circunstancias, salimos a  la defensiva, sin medir lo que decimos, como muchas veces digo, no conectamos la lengua con el cerebro y las consecuencias son decir cosas que pueden herir a otros. A mí me ha pasado muchas veces y hasta he tenido que disculparme, pero lastimosamente hay ocasiones en que la palabra dada ha herido tanto que cuesta luego sanar y termino lastimada a consecuencia de eso.

Por ello, lo dejó como promesa a sus discípulos.<br>  Sin embargo, es una persona a la que el mundo no ve, ni le puede recibir porque el Espíritu de Dios es dado sólo a aquellos que reconocen a Jesús como su Se?or y Salvador.<br>  Las siguientes razones ayudan a confirmar que el Espíritu es una persona :<br>  . Habla   ( Hechos 13:2 / Juan 16:13 )<br>  . Orienta y advierte  ( Hechos 16:6-7 )<br>  . Brinda ayuda e intercede  ( Romanos 8:26 )<br>  . Guía   ( Romanos 8:14 / Juan 16:13 )<br>  . Testifica  ( Juan 15:26 )<br>  . Se contrista o entristece  ( Efesios 4:30 )<br>   <br>  * ES DIOS MISMO<br>  La obra del Espíritu Santo puede verse desde el momento de la creación hasta nuestros días; y sus atributos nos permiten identificarlo como Dios mismo. Las<br>  siguientes citas bíblicas nos orientan al respecto: Lucas 1:35; Salmos 139:7; Hebreos 9:14; 1 Corintios 2:10-11.<br>   <br>  * GLORIFICA A JESúS<br>  Todo lo que el Espíritu hace contribuye a glorificar a Jesús. Cuando una persona deja de glorificar a Jesucristo con sus actos, sus palabras, etc, el Espíritu Santo se hace a un lado. Si tenemos una amistad estrecha con él, logramos el acceso directo a los tesoros divinos y la tercera persona de la Trinidad se encargará de ayudarnos a disfrutarlos. En otras palabras, la fe en Jesucristo nos da derecho legal a sus riquezas, pero la comunión con el Espíritu es la que nos permite disfrutarlas. Cuando glorificamos a Jesús con nuestros actos, el Espíritu se goza y acrecienta su poder en nosostros<br>  ( Juan 16:14-15 / Juan 7:38-39 ).<br>   <br>  * NOS HACE NACER DE NUEVO<br>  Es sólo por medio del Espíritu Santo que llegamos a ser considerados hijos de Dios, ya que es su obra en nuestras vidas la que nos permite nacer de nuevo. Recordemos la inquietud de Nicodemo con respecto al nuevo nacimiento, y la respuesta del Se?or en Juan 3:5 y 6. Para poder nacer del Espíritu de Dios se hace necesario morir primeramente. Es decir, si una persona no muere al pecado, el Espíritu no se vivifica en ella.<br>   <br>  * ES NUESTRO GUIA<br>  Cuando Jesús estuvo en la tierra dijo " Yo soy el camino, y la verdad, y la vida...". él fue y sigue siendo el único camino al Padre. Pero, al irse, Jesús prometió enviar al Espíritu Santo para guiarnos, a fin de que no nos apartemos de la senda correcta ( Juan 16:13 ). él es el que puede interpretar correctamente el mapa de la Palabra de Dios y, como dijo Jesús, noos llevará a toda Verdad.<br>  Quien no cultive una comunión íntima con el Espíritu Santo, corre el peligro de desviarse doctrinalmente.<br>   <br>   <br>  * NOS REVELA LOS SECRETOS DIVINOS<br>  El Padre y el Hijo comparten las riquezas infinitas de su gracia, pero a nosotros nos son dadas a conocer claramente por el Espíritu Santo. Como administrador autorizado de esas bendiciones, de esas riquezas, y de todos los secretos divinos, el Espíritu las imparte a aquellos que, por la fe, nos hemos rendido a Jesús y al mismo Espíritu ( Deuteronomio 29:29 ; 1 Corintios 2:9-10 ).<br>   <br>  2. PROFUNDIZANDO PARA RECIBIR LA LLENURA DEL ESPíRITU SANTO<br>   <br>  * LIMPIEZA DE CORAZóN<br>  El Se?or dijo: " Nadie echa vino nuevo en odres viejos " ( Lucas 5:37 ). El vino rep′resenta la fresca y enérgica presencia del Espíritu Santo, que quiere vestirse en vidas completamente regeneradas. Los odres viejos representan a aquellas personas que experimentaron la presencia del Espíritu en sus vidas po algún tiempo pero que, por diversas circunstancias perdieron la comunión con Dios. El odre nuevo es la vida completamente transformada por Dios<br>  ( 2 Corintios 5:17 ).<br>   <br>  * CREER<br>  En la vida cristiana damos todos nuestros pasos de fe y por fe. Cuando se pide el bautismo en el Espíritu Santo, ya en fe debemos aceptar que lo tenemos, y empezar a hablarle al Se?or en nuevas lenguas. Si una persona está llena de Dios lo expresará con sus palabras. Si por el contrario, está llena de odio y amargura, también usará las palabras para demostrarlo porque son los labios <br>  los que desahogan lo que hay en el corazón ( Mateo 12:34 ).<br>   <br>  * NO PRESTAR NUESTRO CUERPO AL PECADO<br>  Debemos recordar permanentemente que el Espíritu Santo es la presencia de Dios en nuestras vidas. Eso mismo nos indica el apóstol Pablo en 1 Corintios 3:16 " ? No sabéis que sois templo de Dios y que el Espíritu Santo mora en vosotros? Esto nos ense?a que nuestro cuerpo ha sido escogido por Dios como la habitación de su Espíritu, y éste no puede estar en una casa contaminada por el pecado. Ver también Romanos 6:13 y Santiago 3:8-12.<br>   <br>  * RECIBIR AL ESPíRITU SANTO VOLUNTARIAMENTE<br>  El Espíritu Santo es un caballero que sólo entrará a la vida de una persona cuando ésta lo decide voluntariamente y lo invite a seguir. él entra a controlar todas las áreas del ser humano, brindándole poder y libertad absoluta ( 2 Corintios 3:17 ).<br>   <br>  CONCLUSIóN <br>  El Espíritu Santo es la tercera persona de la Trinidad ( Padre, Hijo, Espíritu Santo ), es la promesa de Jesús a sus discípulos convertida en realidad, siendo el Consolador que había indicado que enviaría tan pronto él se fuera.<br>  El Espíritu de Dios llega a morar en la vida del creyente como su amigo y su guía, y lo reviste de poder para controlar todas las áreas de su ser.<br>   <br>  DIOS ES PADRE,HIJO Y ESPIRITU SANTO,UNA ESENCIA EN TRES PERSONAS;NO PIERDEN SUS DIFERENCIAS,PERO COMPARTEN SU ESENCIA.<br>   <br>  REVELACIóN<br>  San Lucas 22: 34  " Y él le dijo : Pedro, te digo que el gallo no cantará hoy antes que tú niegues 3 veces que me conoces.<br>  Sabe Ud. por qué le dijo 3 veces ( y no 4,5,6...) ?<br>  La primera negación : Niega a Dios Padre.<br>  La segunda negación : Niega a Dios Hijo<br>  La tercera negación : Niega a Dios Espíritu Santo.<br>   <br>  RAYOS X<br>  Apocalipsis 12:9  Diablo y Satanás, el cual enga?a al mundo entero. Fue arrojado a la tierra y sus ángeles fueron arrojados con el.<br>   <br>  *EL DIABLO ( SATANáS ) ENGA?A AL MUNDO ENTERO EN LA MENTE.<br>  *EL ES EL PADRE DE LA MENTIRA<br>  *SE METE EN LA MENTE DEL SER HUMANO CON ESTAS   CARACTERISTICAS : PARA ROBAR, MATAR Y DESTRUIR.<br>  * EL LE GUSTA DIVIDIR Y RESTAR.<br>  * EL LE GUSTA TENERTE ESCLAVO EN EL PECADO<br>  * SE DELEITA CON EL ODIO Y EL RENCOR.<br>   <br>  SU MENSAJE PARA EL MUNDO ES<br>  " YO SOY EL ABISMO, LA MENTIRA Y LA MUERTE** "<br>   <br>  YO LES DOY MI MANDAMIENTO<br>  QUE OS ODIES UNOS A OTROS; COMO YO OS HE ODIADO, QUE TAMBIEN OS ODIES UNOS A OTROS.<br>  VAMOS A DESTRUIRNOS UNOS A OTROS; COMO YO LOS DESTRUYO<br>  A CADA UNO EN SUS MENTES..CON EL ALCOHOL, LA DROGA,ETC.<br>   <br>  EL QUIERE LLEVARSE SEGUIDORES, NO SE QUIERE IR SOLO, PORQUE ESCRITO ESTá EN LA SEGUNDA VENIDA DE JESUCRISTO<br>  ( APOCALIPSIS 20:15 ).<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  DIOS TE DICE ESTE DíA<br>  SAN JUAN 12:40 << Cegó los ojos de ellos y endureció su corazón, para que no vean con los ojos, ni entiendan con el corazón, ni se conviertan, y yo los sane >>.<br>   <br>  SAN JUAN 14:6 << YO SOY EL CAMINO, LA VERDAD Y LA VIDA; NADIE VIENE AL PADRE SINO POR Mí.<br>   <br>  * DIOS LE GUSTA SUMAR Y MULTIPLICAR<br>  * PERDONA EL PECADO Y TE HACE LIBRE POR MEDIO DEL ARREPENTIMIENTO.<br>  * SU MENSAJE ES DE AMOR Y DAR VIDA ETERNA Y VIDA ABUNDANTE<br>  POR LOS SIGLOS DE LOS SIGLOS AMéN.<br>   <br>  SAN JUAN 13:34 UN MANDAMIENTO NUEVO OS DOY : QUE OS AMéIS UNOS A OTROS; COMO YO OS HE AMADO, QUE TAMBIéN OS AMéIS UNOS A OTROS.<br>   <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  APLICACIóN<br>  Asegúrese de contar con la guía del Espíritu Santo en su vida. Examine cada uno de sus pasos y, observe, de acuerdo a su conducta y a los logros que obtiene en cada actividad que realiza.<br>  Jesucristo en sus últimos momentos dijo : PERDONALOS PADRE porque no saben lo que hacen ( Porque ya el demonio moraba en sus mentes, el ser humano no sabe nada hasta que se alimenta de la palabra de Dios por medio de la Biblia ).<br>  <br>  EL QUE TIENE OíDO, PARA OIR QUE OIGA; Y EL QUE NO TIENE OIDO PARA OIR QUE NO OIGA.<br>   <br>  ???

El lastimar una herida significa que vuelve a sangrar y si sangra el grosor de su sicatris es mas grande. Así que no permito herirme y cuando otros lo hacen le pido al Se?or que les bendiga y les haga entender que El es el único que puede sanar la herida de su corazón; por que se hiere el mio pero el de ellos también.<br>  <br>  Sabes, cuando Dios sana una herida, no hay nadie que la vuelva a abrir, pues Dios es especialista y sana no remienda como hace el mundo en nuestras vidas.

Venezuela con una buena gerencia turística podría convertirse en una verdadera potencia y podría dejar de vivir del petróleo (para ahorrarlo, para sembrarlo, recordando a Uslar Pietri).. Venezuela es un continente en peque?o, tiene llanos, andes, desiertos y la GRAN SABANA, además de sus espectaculares playas.. lo único que el gobierno debe ocuparse es de la seguridad, porque de que somos chéveres, buena gente y siempre dispuestos a ayudar al turista perdido es verdad, pero debe existir un poco de control... el caos por momentos está bien, pero siempre siendo caóticos así no se puede, no se puede progresar, por lo demás adoro Venezuela, Caracas, Mérida, Sucre, Miranda, Aragua, y todos sus estados.. es lo máximo, vives en el mejor país del mundo y espero que te des cuenta... la seguridad debe ser lo más importante, la seguridad y el orden y para que ambos existan debe haber educación... si logramos eso, tenemos la mitad del mundo ganado... que Viva VENEZUELA..|`|yRxPueoiaa	pais komo otros excepto k tienen a un tio diktador k hace lo k kiere.|`|DyKFPY8Saa	Que pienso de ella. bueno primero soy de Venezuela y pienso que primero no se valora por la poca cultura que tenemos y los antivalores que tenemos. ademas no se aprovecha su cultura demas que tenemos historia y que no es valorada.

Dios es una hipótesis increíblemente complicada. Dios no puede percibirse con nuestros sentidos normales salvo cuando realiza un milagro, y entonces no podemos saber si en realidad fue un milagro. Es más sencillo (más económico, se dice en términos científicos) suspender la creencia en Dios, ya que es tan difícil de probar y aparentemente tan difícil de entender. Por lo tanto, los ateos estamos del lado bueno del argumento: como ya dije antes, no necesitamos probar nada.

Del azar, no. Pues de una sinrazón no puede salir razón (inteligencia).<br>  A“eso"(mente inteligente) le llamamos Dios. Para mí, es el Dios judeocristiano. Para otros, un Dios que solo creó las cosas y no sirve para nada más. Otros dicen que es "el Dios naturaleza". Llámalo como quieras.Para explicarnos esto,nos habló de un seminarios donde se reunían los más notables matemáticos (la UMI) y aplicarnos algo de historia matemática.<br>  Resumidamente, dijo que la forma de ver la matemática ha cambiado muy notoriamente desde 1900, donde se afirmaba que cualquier problema matemático tiene solución, y que siempre cabe encontrarla..y se concluía que, en matemáticas, toda verdad se puede probar, que cabe demostrar la verdad o la falsedad de cualquier enunciado matemático.Desde 1930 aprox. esta mentalidad en los matemáticos cambió, a partir de un cierto enunciado (o teorema, no recuerdo) de Godel que dice: “probado que nunca dispondremos de un programa capaz de resolver cualquier problema; que en un sistema formal como la Aritmética o la Geometría cabe formular enunciados que no se pueden probar ni no probar, demostrar, ni rechazar, sobre los cuales por tanto no cabe decidir; y que esto es algo inherente al propio sistema”?Qué nos dice esto? el saber matemático es y será siempre intrínsecamente incompleto.<br>  En conclusión, la Matemática ha llegado a demostrar que, de igual modo que el sistema solar no es obra del hombre, la sabiduría matemática ha de contenerse en un principio inteligente diferente del hombre.?Interesante, no crees?<br>  rebatelo con mas logica que la matematica y con mas autoridad en el tema que mi professor...|`|iXCXcMMdaa	SI, ESO LO CREES, PERO TAMPOCO PUEDES DEMOSTRARLO , A TI QUE TE GUSTA EL EMPIRISMO...<br>  ADEMAS TE CONTRADICES....SI ALGO ES DEMOSTRABLE , YA NO ES UNA CREENCIA, ES UNA REALIDAD COMPROBADA...PERO NO QUIERE DECIR QUE LO NO COMPROBADO A TU MANERA NO EXISTA...<br>  SOLO PORQUE A TI NO TE HA LLEGADO LA PROXIMIDAD DE DIOS A TU VIDA, NO TIENES NINGUNA FORMA DE CONSTATAR QUE A LOS DEMAS SI ...SOLO ES UNA ESTIMACION TUYA...NADA SOLIDO...<br>  NO ES FORZOSAMENTE UNA NECESIDAD, CREER EN EL MAS ALLA....HAY ATEOS QUE HAN MUERTO ASI..<br>  SOLO QUE LOS CREYENTES , COMO CON DIOS NOS VA BIEN, PENSAMOS QUE PARA LOS DEMAS TAMBIEN SERA BUENO QUE CONOZCAN A DIOS..NADA MAS...<br>  Y ESO DE QUE NO LLEVA A NADA.

Acuerdate que existe lo que se llama LIBERTAD DE CULTO...así como la LIBERTAD DE EXPRESIóN, que es lo que tu y yo y todos estamos haciendo ahorita aplicando nuestra libertad de expresión...y pienso que eso se respeta también.<br>  <br>  NOTA: Creo en el amor, aunque a veces no se manifieste, creo que el hombre llegó a la luna aunque no lo vi personalmente, creo en el sol aunque a veces no salga y creo en Dios aunque no lo vea en persona, YA QUE ES AMOR QUE SE SIENTE, ES ENERGíA, ES ESPIRITUALIDAD. Y se manifiesta de muchas maneras...solo que tu no te abres a ver las bendiciones que te da todos los días de tu vida, empezando cuando abres tus ojitos en la ma?ana, ese es el primer regalo de Dios, un nuevo día de vida que te da.<br>  <br>  Bye y besitos.

Por eso hay que ser conciente de que dios nos quiere y nos ama seamos la religion que queramos lo que a él le importa es que nosotros estemos concientes de nuestro a mor a la vida que él nos dio, para que logremos nuestras metas, tanto fisicas como emocionales.........La igualdad de persona, no de sociedad, al ser de sociedad alli entra el socialismo y el comunismo donde no hay ser mas importante es el dictador al mando, y todo es lo que el dictador diga, las personas que tienen conciencia de democracia sea por no conocerla, y dicen que jesucristo era comunista, cosa que yo no creo, pero todos los dictadores como ciertos presidentes.......

Hacía muchos meses que admiraba un hermoso auto deportivo en una agencia de autos, y sabiendo que su padre podría comprárselo, le dijo que ese auto era todo lo que él quería. <br>  <br>  Así llegó el día de la graduación, y su padre le llamó a que fuera a su privado. Le dijo lo orgulloso que sentía de tener un hijo tan bueno y lo mucho que lo amaba. El padre tenía en sus manos una hermosa caja de regalo. Curioso y de algún modo decepcionado, el joven abrió la caja y lo que encontró fue una hermosa Biblia con cubiertas de piel y con su nombre escrito con letras de oro. Enojado le gritó a su padre diciendo: "?Todo el dinero que tienes y solo me das esta Biblia!". Y salió de la casa.<br>  <br>  Pasaron muchos a?os y el joven se convirtió en un exitoso hombre de negocios. Tenía una hermosa casa y una bonita familia, pero cuando supo que su padre que ya era anciano estaba muy enfermo, pensó en visitarlo. No lo había vuelto a ver desde el día de su graduación. Antes de que pudiera partir a verlo, recibió un telegrama donde decía que su padre había muerto, y le había heredado todas sus posesiones, por lo que necesitaba urgentemente ir a la casa de su padre para arreglar todos los trámites de inmediato. <br>  <br>  Cuando llegó a la casa de su padre, su corazón se llenó de una gran tristeza y arrepentimiento. Empezó a ver todos los documentos importantes que su padre tenía y encontró la Biblia que en aquella ocasión su padre le había dado. Con lágrimas la abrió y empezó a hojear sus páginas. Su padre cuidadosamente había subrayado un verso en Mateo 7:11 donde decía: "Y si vosotros siendo malos, sabéis dar buenas dádivas a vuestros hijos, cuanto más nuestro Padre Celestial dará a sus hijos aquello que le pidan". <br>  <br>  Mientras leía esas palabras, unas llaves de auto cayeron de la Biblia. Tenía una tarjeta de la agencia de autos donde había visto ese auto deportivo que tanto había deseado. En la tarjeta estaba la fecha del día de su graduación y las palabras: "TOTALMENTE PAGADO".<br>  <br>  Cuantas veces hemos rechazado y perdido las bendiciones de Dios porque no vienen envueltas en "paquetes hermosos", como nosotros esperamos.<br>  Dios tiene un regalo para ti que en la tarjeta dice:"TOTALMENTE PAGADO" y es tu salvación.<br>  Tu puedes ser como el joven del relato o puedes ver mas allá de la envoltura del regalo y recibirlo.

Mira la diferencia: vivir conscientemente significa vivir abierto, sin esconderse, sin jugar al gato y el ratón.<br>  Estar alerta significa ser vulnerable, y sea lo que sea que suceda, que suceda. Lo aceptas, pero nunca te comprometes, nunca compras algo olvidándote de tu conciencia. Incluso si ello significa el quedarse totalmente solo, aceptamos el estar solo, pero estarás conscientemente alerta, despierto. Unicamente con esta vigilancia empieza la verdadera religión a suceder.<br>  En el momento que tu conciencia se haga un continuo, no necesitarás de la mente. Ya no habrá planear , tus actos provendrán de tu conciencia, no de tu mente. No habrá entonces necesidad de disculpas ni necesidad de ofrecer explicaciones. Serás lo que tengas que ser, no habrá nada que esconder. En ese momento sea lo que seas, eres, no puedes ser nada más. Puedes mantenerte en un estado de recordación continuo. A través de recordar, de esta atención, surge la auténtica religión, nace la auténtica moralidad.|`|7dc5894973edf466ffc90de024819a4daa	gracias x compartir esto con nosotros...<br>  sigue asi, Dios tiene una mision para ti...|`|UpdHFcpJaa	muy interesante esta reflexión, gracias por poner ese entusiasmo en escribir estas reflexiones, siempre que las analizo, entiendo lo bueno que existe en el mundo.<br>  Feliz a?o nuevo.|`|e4za5609aa	Gracias por tal regalo, recibido y aceptado con gusto.<br>  <br>  Que estés bien

Es mas, como sabes de la fecha exacta de la existencia de los israelitas?? Que... los libros de historia?? Por que crees en ellos?? Por que crees todo lo que dicen? <br>  <br>  Yo te contesto... si, la unica razon por la que creo en la Biblia es la Fe. Si tienes fe, digan lo que digan los "intelectuales" que estan en contra de la religion (como tu) vas a creer en lo que dice la Biblia. Yo creo en la Biblia por la misma razon por la que tu crees en los libros de historia.

No tiene ningún caso. Todo mundo sabe que la biblia no es algo que debe tomarse al pié de la letra, sino que debe interpretarse y además fué escrita por humanos, y es de humanos equivocarse. Mi convicción es que la biblia dice muchas cosas en sentido figurado y muchas otras en forma fidedigna. Es cuestión de fé el creer o no creer lo que dice. Al fin de cuentas, la biblia se ve fuertemente respaldada por la tradición popular y no es un texto científico sino religioso. Eso deberías de tomarlo en cuenta.|`|usRTEy6Laa	Bueno,te pasa lo que a muchos,"tu crees"....para tener fundamento en lo que creemos cuando lo buscamos desde el punto de vista del curioso,lo debemos hacer de la manera adecuada,por ej si vas a estudiar la Biblia debes estudiar historia,arqueologia,lenguas muertas,hermeneutica y en base a lo que encuentres podras dar un veredicto final"crees o no".Con relacion a lo de la escritura estas equivocado,por favor busca fuentes historicas que no tengan nada que ver con la Biblia y comprueba por ti mismo que estas en un error.saludos|`|yNQqZ3kcaa	Ya déjalos en paz chavo, los verdaderos ateos tampoco no podemos estar seguors al 100%, pues de todo hay que dudar de todo, para eso está la ciencia|`|6rX0pr8gaa	Existen muchas pruebas.

Están agrupadas en 26 atolones teniendo cada una el nombre de una o dos letras de la escritura Thaana. Debe su nombre a la derivación en sánscrito, en la que mal significa miles y diva, isla. Es decir, miles de islas.<br>  <br>  Posee un clima tropical y húmedo con una precipitación aproximada de 2000 mm al a?o. El islam es la religión predominante, el cual fue introducido en 1153. Fue una colonia portuguesa (1558), holandesa (1654) y británica (1887). En 1953 intentó establecerse una república pero pocos meses después se reimpuso el sultanato. Obtuvo la independencia en 1965 y en 1968 fue reinstaurada la república, sin embargo en 38 a?os como tal, sólo ha tenido dos presidentes, aunque las restricciones políticas han disminuido recientemente. Es el país menos poblado de Asia y el menos poblado entre los países musulmanes.|`|tdObrLylaa	Diganme donde esta esa isla que yo tambien me prendo|`|6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Tranquilo igual me paso a mi, hasta que pude leer una respuesta y me enteré que era por ser de las Islas Maldivias.

Solo venero y adoro a Jesucristo en Espiritu. NADA MáS. Y una cosa es orar, que sería hablar en silencio con Dios y Jesús y otra diferente el rezar, que sería como un padre nuestro o un ave maria que si es corrido como dices....pero las dos son importantes y depende de cada persona como desee llegar a Dios....en mi caso particular acostumbro a orar.<br>  <br>  En cuanto a la fe, pienso que nada de lo que haga sin tener FE no se me dará....no solamente en orar, sino en todo lo que realice en mi vida, si lo hago con fe de que se me dará, por supuesto que será así.

No olvides que muchas personas solo tienen religiosidad : ya sean catolicas , evangelicas y musulmanas.es decir solo actuan por miedo o por si acaso, pero no por convencimiento interior , ni por FE , la cual hay que pedirla a DIOS mismo , uno no se puede dar la FE , aunque haga mucho esfuerzo.SIN embargo no me atrevo a juzgar a las personas asi hallan hecho oraciones corriendo, solo DIOS conoce sus almas y éL  sabra.<br>  <br>  SHALOM ( te deseo todo bien)|`|M6YrjMCJaa	Por que atacas y humillas a los catolicos con esas preguntas??? si tanta curiosidad tienes podes ir a la Iglecia catolica y preguntar estoy segura que la catequista o el padre te podran resolver tus preguntas, y respondiendote creo QUE VALE MAS UNA ORACION SIN FE Y DE CORRIDITO que las porquerias que escribes es  HUMILLANTE, pero me imagino que asi son tus padres ya que SOMOS EL REFLEJOS DE NUESTROS PADRES ya me imagino bien criticonsitos verdad????|`|Tml8ARwGaa	Se supone que la oracion es para comunicarse con Dios, no para repetir frases...|`|de6829ec7bb788891d006ae86540ac28aa	Orar es hablar con Dios y si no crees como vas a hablar si de antemano ya rechazas lo que pides.

Pero dejalo que elija su vida y en quien creer cuando tenga mayoría de edad y sepa comprender, acuerdate que los hijos no son de uno sino de la vida.... a ti te pasaría y cuando grandes tomaste tu decisión de ser agnóstico, entonces porque adelantar la situación de tu hijo?<br>  <br>  No soy madre aún, pero mis padres me ense?aron eso, no quitarle la inocencia mientras se pueda a los ni?os ya que es su única ilusión mientras estan peque?os.<br>  <br>  Asi amigo, que a comprarle lo que te escriba para la cartita del ni?o jesus o santa claus y los 3 reyes magos y despues con el tiempo le dirás...pero ahora no porque lo marcarías y lo entristecerías, al ver a sus amiguitos jugando con todo esos regalos y él no.<br>  <br>  Besitos, y piensa que ya tu eres adulto y puedes entender pero él aún no tiene la maduréz suficiente para entenderlo y lo marcarias para siempre.<br>  <br>  Bye|`|7e90e79cf21099ebcaafd54995df6bfeaa	Yo te aconsejo por el bien de tu ni?o que no le quites la ilusión, los cristianos les hablamos claro a los ni?os pero a la vez con suavidad no imponiéndoles nada, se les dice los pro y los contra, no se que edad tendrá tu hijo y si él entiende ya algunas cosas, por que te voy a contar una anécdota que pasó con mis dos hijos cuando aún eran peque?os, ellos nacieron en este país EU, los presenté a la iglesia evangelica a la que pertenecía en ese tiempo y se criaron yendo a ella, cuando la ni?a tenía seis a?os y el ni?o tres, decidí que fueran a pasar unas vacaciones a mi país Nicaragua, mi familia super contenta por que no los conocían, bueno el caso es que mis medios hermanos que también vivieron aca y se regresaron celebraban halloween para octubre igual que acá, ellos no son cristianos, entonces por quedar bien con los sobrinos les compraron un disfraz a cada y cuando mis hijos llegaron de visita a su casa se los mostraron y les dijeron que se lo pusieran para ir a pedir dulces en el vecindario, eso es en Nicaragua, pues la ni?a con solo seis a?os le dijo a su tía de 20 a?os que le agradecía la invitación pero que ellos eran cristianos evangélicos y que no le rendían culto al diablo, que a Dios no le agradaba eso, y no quiso ponerse el disfraz, ni el ni?o tampoco, eso demuestra que los ni?os tienen mucha inteligencia y a como uno les ense?a eso ellos aprenden, es la vez y mis hijos todos son adultos y se han salido por tiempo del camino de Dios, pero siempre regresan, por que lo que bien aprenden no se les olvida, eso es el deber de nosotros como padres, darles una base, una ense?anza que tengan temor de Dios, si ellos cuando sean adultos deciden salirse será por su propia decisión pero al menos nosotros como padres hemos cumplido con nuestra misión. No hay mejor camino para ellos que el de Dios, se crían sanos, lejos de vicios, de malas compa?ias y son obedientes, aunque después como te digo, ellos cambien si es lo que quieren hacer.|`|3CwxMi9Waa	solo diviertete, el que seas agnostico no impide que trates de disfrutar las fiestas, si quieres regalarle algo esta bien, yo creo que con tu presencia en casa es suficiente.|`|Ch3ywYCmaa	Es lindo tener esa ilusión de los reyes Magos y esas ondas, utiliza este tiempo para compartir con tu familia que tu seas agnostico no quiere decir que ellos tambien deben serlo, Dejales almenos esa ilusión ( yo soy agnostica y a mi hermana le dejo cosas el dia de reys y navidad)<br>  Despues con el tiempo ellos sabran la verdad, esperemos que no muy tarde.<br>  SUERTE|`|RZZEQ8wnaa	Existe una hipocrecía e incoherencia en las acciones de los padres a los hijos, diciendoles mentiras "piadosas" sobre cuentos de santacloses y reyes magos, pero recordemos que las mentiras son mentiras sean piadosas o con dolo.<br>  <br>  Jesucristo dijo que conozcas la verdad y esta te hará libre.<br>  <br>  Probablemente hubo un santa, probablemente hubieron reyes magos o lo que sean, pero hoy no los hay y  hacerle creér esto a los ni?os por las "ilusiones" me parece que no es congruente con quienes se dicen hablar con la verdad.<br>  <br>  Si yo estuviera en tu situación, le daría regalos, pero le explicaría a razón de que se los das, sin mentiras ni medias verdades.<br>  <br>  ?No hay ya magia en lo que vemos cotidianamente? ?En la lluvia? ?En el aire? ?En los colores? ?En la quimica?<br>  <br>  Solo las ilusiones causan desilusiones.|`|qdNOB3Vjaa	siguele el juego|`|8Sj4Ugjhaa	Pues tu no les mates la ilusion del santa o de los reyes tu dales algo y di nadamas que ellos existen no les platiques que son de algo religioso..|`|96f268321312a725f61a1dc3f4f0f676aa	Es serio el dilema, un ni?o vive gracias al fascinante mundo de la fantasia y la ilusion, destruye eso, y la carcasa vacia crecera vacio y sin esperanza.<br>  No creo que debas mentirle, solo dile que a ti eso no te interesa, pero cuentale alguna historia alusiva, no importa si lo crees o no, el chacho ya tendra sus propias cosas en que creer, cosas que a ti no te gustaran o no entenderas.<br>  Solo recuerda que un padre es muchas cosas: guia, protector, consejero, a veces complice, un compa?ero no de juegos -por lo del trabajo y eso- pero si alguien que sabe como entretener.<br>  Chupavitos aun no es padre, confiesolo, pero el mio aun vive y esa es la impresion que de el siente.<br>  Chupavitos|`|98xvc6j4aa	Es una pregunta complicada que yo misma me hago sobre todo ahora que voy a ser mamá. He consultado con algunas amistades y me han dado algunos consejos. En principio, la Navidad y las fiestas son algo cultural y tradicional, por lo tanto no es bueno excluir al ni?o de las mismas, de pronto es como las fiestas de nuestra patria, pues no hay que ser recontra patriotas para celebrarlas, ese mismo espíritu festivo sin necesidad de darle un matiz religioso creo que sería bueno transmitirle a los ni?os. Regalos, me parece buena opción mi estimado sobre todo porque seguro sus amiguitos los recibirán y para que no se sienta raro o excluido le daría uno o dos, pero tampoco lo atiborraría a regalos. Ahora el agua y el pasto de los Reyes Magos, lo haría resaltando que es una tradición, quitándole el sesgo religioso al mismo. Mucha suerte, comprendo tus dudas porque yo tambien las siento sobre todo esta Navidad!. Saludos, felices fiestas para ti y para tu ni?ito ;)|`|DZTOCoGKaa	creo que no deberias meter tu hijo en tu misma bolsa... no se si soy clara, me parece que ante el deberias respetar las tradiciones navide?as y de reyes, por lo menos mientras sea chiquito, cuando sea grande podra decidir por si mismo sus creencias religiosas. <br>  eso deja que lo decida a su debido momento pero ahora seria un bajon, a los chicos les encanta disfrutar de la magia de la navidad, esperar a papa noel, poner el pastito y el agua, tengo una nena de 4 y muero por su carita cada navidad a pesar de que odio esta epoca, pero ella me hace revivir todo lo que la disfrute de chiquita.<br>  ponele onda!!!|`|S3sQy1UQaa	yo soy ateo y no festejo lo que los cristianos, pero hago fiesta por que nada tiene de religioso esta fecha. para mi hija no hay santoclos, ni regalos hipocritas, cuando ella nececita algo simplemente se lo doy y no nececito anfarla enganando ni buscando una fecha especial para hacerlo.<br>  no importa que seas "agnostico" lo que importa es que no seas hipocrita.|`|X57rA1YXaa	Claro.. ya que eso es cultural.. no tanto religioso.<br>  <br>  No hay que ser tan radical... esa son culturas que no se deben perder.<br>  <br>  Un ateo./|`|d8897d1f14ff854a851c6d4600e9bc71aa	Creo que como padre debes ensenarse la honestidad a tu hijo, independientemente que cuando el sea mayor tendra que tomar su decision personal en cuanto a la fe. Fui atea y hace 14 anos soy cristiana evangelica, y te cuento una experiencia muy linda que vivi aunque aparentemente contraria a tu conviccion. En este pais donde resido actualmente,  se celebra Halloween, pero los cristianos no lo festejamos y los que tienen ninos pequenos asi se lo hacen saber y le dan una explicacion veraz de acuerdo a su edad.<br>  En mi Iglesia hay una nina muy especial para mi, acaba de cumplir 5 anos; en medio del Culto se me acerco y me dio una invitacion coloreada por ella. La abri y fue grande mi sorpresa al ver que me estaba invitando a una fiesta infantil y el motivo era FIESTA PORQUE NO CELEBRAMOS HALLOWEN, me quede confundida y fui a hablar con sus padres por la sabiduria que habian tenido con esa idea, me negaron, pues fue la nina quien ideo la fiesta . Fui con mi esposo , eramos los unicos adultos invitados que no tenian ninos pequenos, fue muy lindo. Desearia fervientemente que conocieras al Dios que amo, que celebraras la navidad y permitieras que tus hijos conocieran el verdadero significado, pero no te aconsejaria jamas que fueras de doble moral y dieras un mal ejemplo a tu hijo. Un saludo cordial, yo.<br>  <br>  Nota: Naci en un pais ateo, no se celebraba navidad y se negaba a Dios, no habian Reyes Magos, ni arbol, ni nada, y te cuento que conoci a Dios por medio de mis hijos pequenos que los invitaron a una  Iglesita donde habia una Actividad de Verano, iban algunos amiguitos y los acompane para oir que  hablaban y ahi Dios se me revelo. Ellos, mi esposo y yo le servivmos y amamos.

CJTCiFjpaa	Secondo me non è assolutamente offensifa, negretto è un modo simpatico di indicare una persona, ma non per discriminarla! Per insultare una persona di colore ti assicuro che ci sono cose di gran lunga più offensive, che non cito perchè non sono razzista e i "negretti" mi sono sempre stati simpatici.<br>  Come dici tu, poi, le vere discriminazioni si fanno a fatti, anche le parole sono pesanti, ma in questo caso proprio non mi pare. Se vuoi essere rassicurato, credimi, non hai insultato proprio nessuno!|`|FvxWiXwFaa	NO NO...Hanno pienamente ragione....O sei razzista o no,quindi, soprattutto a parole devi cercare di dimostrarlo!e poi come dimostri coi fatti,non essendo razzista,di non essere razzista.....Heheh. In pratica lo hai offeso di brutto.NOn cadere nel ca zze ggio,ma sii serio!|`|OguIKWelaa	beh se avessi detto "neretto" forse era meglio...! in effetti se usi "negretto" ti avvali della parola "negro" che obbiettivam è un dispregiativo...!<br>  certo che cmq è entrato abastanza nella bocca d tt usare il termine "negro" anche se nn è molto simpatico e sarebbe meglio nn usarlo! xò avento detto "negretto",io nn vedo nulla di razzista...sinceram la xsona che t ha detto qll ha esagerato un bel po'...! cmq next time meglio se lo chiami x nome o dici "neRetto"...suona anche più carino!!<br>  ciao!|`|Zq9WxaIDaa	in teoria negretto è offensivo xk si dovrebbe chiamare nero, ma ad alcuni di colore non da fastidio...|`|f4YxyHs3aa	no vabbè dai non dire così...<br>  evidentemente chi si attacca a quei dettagli è una persona che ci tiene ai dettagli... solo questo<br>  ma non è il primo razzista...|`|j3EWOUvGaa	beh..cmq si...è una parola offensiva..magari prima non ne eri a conoscenda...beh..da ora in poi lo ricorderai! se devi proprio specificare il colore di quella persona indicala dicendo soltanto : di colore..|`|sLiIvoqgaa	NEGRO, negretto.. sono parole offensive per le persone di colore.. sicuramente tu non l'avrai fatto con qll' intento, ma a quella persone è arrivato 1 messaggio sbagliato.<br>  la prossima volta cerca di evitare certi nomignoli! :)|`|w2SZKGNUaa	Allora per alcune persone può essere mlto offensivo. E quelle persone sono molto...IGNIORANTI?? Boh magari si..Comunque dipende da persone a persone. Se lo avessi detto a me io ti avrei chiamato LATTICINO!!!

Ciaooo!|`|hUWwnPA8aa	non direi|`|mn1eVksFaa	Mi sembri una persona sensata.

Io dico negretto e negro... ma che c'è di strano? Dico spesso "che bellino quel bimbo negretto" e non trovo niente di diverso da "che bellino quel bimbo nero". Non ci formalizziamo... Ho sempre frequentato persone di colore senza problemi e odio il razzismo,  veramente mi dà ai nervi... Ma dire negretto non è nulla di strano, anzi lo trovo dolce.

0FvjCtTUaa	Patrick Henry is a Christian.<br>  <br>  <br>  From the quoted that he quoted in 1776, "It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great Nation was founded not by religionists, but by Christians; not on religions, but on the Gospel of Jesus Christ. For that reason alone, people of other faiths have been afforded freedom of worship here." We can see that he is a Christian.

WFf2h7Cpaa	Non esiste un giorno specifico della settimana per uscire di casa o per fare qualcosa di specifico, semplicemente si prende e si esce quando si vuole (non perchè lo decidiamo noi con la nostra ragione, ma perchè ci spinge qualcosa da dentro!). Io ho sempre voluto programmare tutto nella mia vita: diventare grande, trovare un fidanzato, sposarmi, fare una famiglia con tanti figli. Oggi non è più così, tutti questi programmi sono andati in fumo, perchè ho scoperto qualcosa di più importante di tutto ciò che ho detto poco fà: amare prima di tutto me stessa, scoprire chi sono e come sono, partendo dai miei difetti, proprio quei difetti che ho sempre tenuto nascosto a me e agli altri: invidia, orgoglio, pregiudizio nei confronti del sesso, è peccato! E' veramente così indispensabile uscire ogni sabato sera perchè così fanno tutti?... altrimenti ci si sente inferiori, giudicati perchè non abbiamo una compagnia. Il fatto è che siamo noi che ci giudichiamo per primi e non ammettiamo le nostre colpe. Siamo sempre pronti a dare la colpa agli altri se le cose non vanno come noi vorremmo: non troviamo una fidanzata, non abbiamo i soldi che vorremmo avere, il lavoro dei nostri sogni. E' ora che ci prendiamo le nostre responsabilità, che non ci nascondiamo più dietro il muro che ci siamo costruiti intorno, invalicabile e indistruttibile. Non importa chi trovi il sabato sera quando esci, importante è che ti prenda le tue responsabilità, in quello che parli alle persone, quello che a loro comunichi con un solo gesto del tuo corpo. Apri la porta di te stesso e fai uscire quello di tanto bello, gioioso e inconcepibile che c'è dentro di te. Stasera è sabato e c'è gente che ti scrive!<br>  <br>  Un abbraccio e grazie.

Se non credi in Dio, non puoi credere nemmeno a Satana! Sarebbe un controsenso! Perchè credere in una figura rappresentativa del bene come Dio e poi non credere che ne esista un'altra ma opposta!? Nel mondo esiste il bene e il male...se nel bene si fà riferimento a Dio, per il male ci sarà sicuramente un altro riferimento! E poi, bisogna capire tu per "Satana" cosa intendi! Se pensi al diavolo con la coda e le corna...penso che sei abbastanza fuori strada. Il bene (Dio) e il male (Satana) sono in ognuno di noi, in percentuali molto "distanti" tra loro, a seconda del carattere e dei comportamenti del singolo. L'unico che non ne aveva era il Figlio di Dio...Lui era immune dal Diavolo (ovviamente per chi ci crede)....Spero di essermi riuscito a spiegare in modo chiaro...Ti saluto...|`|vm5xAShNaa	certo

Hay una mentira que envuelve una oración que dice:  “Santa María, madre de Dios ruega por nosotros pecadores”.<br>  <br>   Y hay otra que dice: “Santa María madre de Dios, sin pecado concebida”. Esas son dos MENTIRAS muy poderosas que han fastidiado a toda la humanidad.<br>  <br>  Primero: Sin pecado concebida. Esta oración viola el principio de que el cordero quitó el pecado del mundo. Viola el principio del evangelio.<br>  <br>  Segundo: María estuvo casada y se mantuvo virgen. Jesucristo hombre (Apóstol José Luis De Jesús Miranda) declara que María fue una mujer pecadora, que encontró gracia ante el Se?or para traer el velo llamado Jesús de Nazaret.<br>  <br>  <br>  Es inconcebible entender que una creación (María) vino a ser madre del creador. No tiene sentido común. Hay un dogma establecido por el Papa Pío IX en el 1854, dentro de la doctrina Mariana, llamada “Ineffabilis Deus”, que dice: “La virgen fue preservada inmune de la mancha del pecado original, desde el primer instante de su concepción por singular gracia…” ?Eso suena muy bonito! pero NO tiene base en el evangelio de la incircuncisión.<br>  <br>  El problema es que el evangelio establece un principio y está en Romanos 5: 12, donde declara que el pecado entró al mundo por un hombre (Adán), y la muerte pasó a TODOS los hombres (incluyendo a María), ya que todos pecaron. Eso no lo dice la doctrina Mariana, pero sí el evangelio de Pablo.<br>  <br>  Después de Adán, todos los seres humanos nacieron bajo esa cobertura del pecado, pero cuando Cristo muere y resucita quitó el pecado (Hebreos 9: 26). Es una blasfemia decir que María fue concebida sin pecado o que es la “madre de Dios”, si Lucas 1: 46 y 47 dice que ella necesitó de el Salvador del mundo.<br>  <br>   También los apóstoles son tenidos como ídolos, cuando éstos tenían mujeres igual que los hermanos de Jesús (hijos de María) y Pedro (Cefas), según 1a a  los Corintios 9: 5. El primer Papa tuvo mujer, tenía suegra (Mateo 8: 14). Aquí el sexo no es el problema, el sexo es buenísimo; es la DOCTRINA del celibato que es una carga para los que no tienen el don de continencia (los sacerdotes católicos) que abusan sexualmente a ni?os, y por eso tienen demandas multimillonarias.<br>  <br>   Recordemos que Dios aborrece la idolatría (éxodo 20: 4 y 5 y el Salmo 115: 1- 8), muchos en su ignorancia lo hacen; por eso en 2a a Timoteo 3: 5 dice que éstos tienen apariencia de piedad y hay que evitarlos.|`|dbwviWlyaa	NO, NO CELEBRAN LA NAVIDAD, CELEBRAN EL QUE LES DEN REGALOS.|`|pilfUNjqaa	Somos animales de costumbre.<br>  <br>  seguimos las tradiciones en mi caso particular, si creo que Jesús nació y existió el Histórico el de la FE<br>  es otro tema.<br>  <br>  Para mi fue una persona excelente<br>  un profeta pero conservo mis dudas<br>  a que sea el DEMIURGO<br>  <br>  María Isabel|`|qfgo0kuTaa	es parecido aa porque los catolicos van al colegio y estudian la evolucion osea no tiene naa q ver|`|ryq2MS6uaa	Pues no tenemos culpa de que nuestro calendario celebre fiestas católicas.

La sanación de mi madre y hermano que estuvieron en coma y los médicos nos dijeron que ya ellos habian hecho su parte y que lo demás corria por cuenta de Dios...que tal, y eran médicos y mi madre y hermano se salvaron, solo que mi hermano quedó ciego y le pido con todo mi corazón a Dios que le devuelva la vista...y se que me dará eso que tanto le pido.<br>  <br>  En fin, Dios se manifiesta de muchas maneras, y cuando uno le ha abierto su corazón para dejarlo entrar y que obre en nosotros, nos da discernimiento es decir entendimiento de las cosas que nos suceden a diario. De verdad que son muchas las cosas y situaciones donde ha estado metida la mano de Dios.<br>  <br>  No es necesario ser fanática como algunos nos dicen acá, para creer en su amor y en sus milagros. Reconozco que no asisto regularmente a la iglesia ni me congrego, pero tengo comunión personal todos los días de mi vida con él, como? dedicandole un tiempo todos los días en hablarle, en decirle lo que quiero, en pedirle de corazón me perdone por mis malos pensamientos o pecados cometidos y en darle las gracias por todo lo que me ha dado. Ya que tengo mucho y algunos no tienen nada, y trato en lo que puedo, de ayudar a todo aquel que lo necesite a veces sin que me lo pidan.<br>  <br>  Acuerdate que la Fe mueve monta?as, y la espiritualidad se siente y se transmite a los demás.<br>  <br>  Besitos y cuidate...|`|c0dcd5b9e7d8c59b3199d8c2b20da073aa	Nada|`|JV1iZxhUaa	que día a día en un mundo tan inseguro, cada noche me recuesto y digo "gracias Dios, estoy segura un día más"|`|c07ebef23cd4d5d304b0a85e990c6675aa	AMM <br>  TODO LO QUE VIENE DE DIOS<br>  ME IMPRESIONA., PERO MAS *<br>  EL HABER DADO A SU HIJO<br>  X LA SALVACION DE NOSOTROS<br>  ES LO QUE MAS LE HE AGRADECIDO<br>  SIEMPRE-.,<br>  SALU2|`|jXrvWCwAaa	No quiero caer en la vanidad, te doy mi testimonio, hace a?os estaba prendida de una necedad, todo parecia indicar que de seguir adelante nada funcionaría, pero pedí que se realizara mi deseo, asi fué; despues de unos meses ya no queria queso, sino salirme de la ratonera.<br>  Desde entonces  me di cuenta que cada que pido algo con la suficiente confianza de que ocurrirá, lo que deseo se materializa, asi he aprendido a conocer el valor de Dios, en las buenas y en las mejores, contra aquello que decia Lennon, que Dios es del tama?o de tus necesidades.<br>  Me ha impresionado con su poder creativo, con su magnificencia, con todo.<br>  Shalom|`|xmzag9NEaa	pues me han dicho q las cosas buenas y malas (malas para q aprenda jejej) como  q tengo familia amigos, conciencia, amor, nose etc me las ha dado dios, pero q me de algo dirctamente a mi mmm no creo o no me he dado cuenta igual soy un poco despistado, pero le podria agradecer aun q no este seguro q las cosas bienen de el ya sea buenas o malas, pero por si las dudas...... gracias a quien corresponda|`|0LfUNl0Taa	1.- Me impresiona de Dios el hecho de creer de todo corazón que existe y no dudarlo ningún momento...
