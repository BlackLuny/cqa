f7nCfOy3aa	Puerto Ricans often proudly identify themselves as Boricua, loosely based on Borincano (archaic), both words originating from the Taíno word Boriken (also known as Boriquén, Borinquen, or Borinquén), to illustrate their recognition of their Taíno heritage. The word Boriken, which translates to "the great land of the valiant and noble Lord",[3] was used by the original Taíno Indian population to refer to the island of Puerto Rico before the arrival of the Spanish. The use of the word Boricua has been popularized in the island and abroad by descendents of Puerto Rico heritage, commonly using the phrase, "Yo soy Boricua" ("I am Boricua", or "I am Puerto Rican") to identify themselves as Puerto Ricans.

Funde in Schweden und ?gypten lassen auf ein Mindestalter von 14.000 Jahren schlie?en.<br>  Seiner Form entsprechend bezeichnet man es auch als Hakenkreuz, wobei differenziert werden muss zwischen Hakenkreuz (allgemein) und dem NS-Hakenkreuz, das von der NSDAP gebraucht wurde. Das NS-Hakenkreuz steht meist auf der Spitze, doch weil es sich nicht eindeutig von einer Swastika unterscheiden l?sst, steht die Verwendung aller hakenkreuzf?rmigen Symbole im politischen Kontext innerhalb Deutschlands und ?sterreichs unter Strafe (siehe unten).<br>  Vor allem in Süd- und Ostasien steht die Swastika nach wie vor in der ursprünglichen Tradition.<br>  Im Deutschen sind Swastika und Hakenkreuz die gebr?uchlichen Namen; weiter gibt es den Begriff ?Sonnenrad“ und die heute nicht mehr gebrauchte Bezeichnung ?Winkelma?kreuz“. Das Hakenkreuz (crux gammata oder Gammadion, weil aus vier umgekehrten Haken – dem griechischen Buchstaben Gamma – bestehend) ist ein sehr altes Sonnenzeichen und eines der ?ltesten Symbole der Menschheit. Vielerorts wird es als Sonnensymbol, oftmals auch als Symbol der Sonnenbewegung aufgefasst und im übertragenen Sinne als Zeichen des Lebens und der Wiedergeburt.<br>  In früheren Kulturen war es auf vier Kontinenten (allen au?er Australien) verbreitet. Es hatte verschiedene Bedeutungen, wie z. B. Fruchtbarkeit. Die Swastika gab es beispielsweise in der kretominoischen Kultur auf Kreta (ab etwa 3500 v. Chr.; oft Motiv der Vasenmalerei), in Mesopotamien und im Reich Elam, im Buddhismus oder im Hinduismus (oft in Verbindung mit der Gottheit Ganesha). Gelegentlich ist es in alten Synagogen zu finden, in frühchristlicher Zeit wurde es auf Fresken und Steinplatten als Kreuzsymbol verwendet. In der romanischen Ornamentik ist es, verbunden mit der M?anderlinie, als ?Schutzmittel gegen den Teufel“, zu finden. Auch auf gotischen Bauwerken ist es mitunter in Europa zu sehen. Die R?mer haben es ebenfalls verwendet. Im R?misch-Germanischen Museum in K?ln ist ein antiker r?mischer schwarzwei?er Mosaikfu?boden mit linksdrehenden Hakenkreuzen und sie umgebenden Ornamenten zu besichtigen.<br>  <br>  Bedeutung im westlichen Kulturkreis<br>  Vor dem so genannten ?Dritten Reich“ symbolisierte das Hakenkreuz bei den Kelten ein Wagenrad, an dem brennende Fackeln befestigt waren. Ein solches Rad wurde bei Festen einen Berg herabgerollt. Durch die Rotation und den Fahrtwind bildeten die lodernden Flammen das Hakenkreuz. In der vorchristlichen germanischen Kultur, wo es auch Fyrfos genannt wird, symbolisiert das Hakenkreuz den wirbelnden Hammer des Donar und ist somit vor allem ein Symbol für die Kr?fte der irdischen Natur, die sowohl Schutz, als auch Schaden, Vernichtung und Wiedergeburt bringen k?nnen.<br>  In der Heraldik wird das Hakenkreuz – neben zahlreichen anderen Kreuzformen – als Heroldsbild verwendet.<br>  Bis zur Verwendung durch die NSDAP erlebte das Hakenkreuz, vor allem in Europa und den USA, eine Renaissance. So warb zum Beispiel die Coca-Cola-Company 1925 mit einem Schlüsselanh?nger in Hakenkreuzform, wohl wissend um das positive Image der Swastika. In der deutschen Goa-Trance-Szene findet das Symbol heute gelegentlich wieder Verwendung. Seit 1910 ist das Hakenkreuz das Emblem der Isl?ndischen Dampfschifffahrts-Gesellschaft und bis heute in Verwendung. Das Hakenkreuz war bis zum Dritten Reich Bestandteil des Logos der d?nischen Brauerei Tuborg und sowohl die schwedische Firma ASEA als auch die norwegische A/S Per Kure – Norsk Motor- og Dynamofabrik hatten ein Hakenkreuz als Firmenlogo.<br>  Ein aufrecht stehendes blaues Hakenkreuz, jedoch ohne Beziehung zum Nationalsozialismus, war Hoheitszeichen der finnischen Luft- und Panzerwaffe von 1918 bis 1944. Auch verschiedene finnische Orden verwendeten das Hakenkreuz (z. B. Mannerheim-Kreuz). Bis heute tr?gt es der Orden des Freiheitskreuzes. Die Hakenkreuze der Collane des finnischen Ordens der Wei?en Rose wurden erst 1963 beseitigt. Die heutige Flagge des finnischen Pr?sidenten zeigt das Freiheitskreuz (Vapaudenristi) mit dem integrierten Hakenkreuz. Auch der lettische B?rent?terorden verwendete das Symbol.<br>  <br>  Ob die Verehrung des Hackenkreuzes, des "deutschen Grisses" etc. Zwang ware, glaube ich nicht. Nach dem Krieg hat keiner von dem HOLOCAUST gewu?t, ganze Nachbarnfamilien sind verschwungden und keiner hat das gemerkt, keiner hat die Kristalnacht in Nürnberg 1938 erlebt, keiner hat die Nürnberger Gesetze gekannt, keiner wusste von Euthanasie, alle waren unschuldig, alle waren Opfer. <br>  KEINER HAT ETWAS GEWUSST!!! <br>  Der liebe Führer wurde erst in 1976 als tot erkl?rt (Tr. Junge -Privatsekret?rin des letzten, Hafner, Fein und viele andere HISTORIKER, keine M?rchenschreiber).<br>  Lieber h?re ich auf!|`|80fb7f5a2a3408b17aa4ed18f1fe856caa	Dazu aeussert sich Wikipedia folgendermassen:<br>  <br>  Heesters im nationalsozialistischen Deutschland<br>  1936 wechselte Heesters nach Berlin, wo er in zahlreichen Operettenverfilmungen und Musikfilmen mitwirkte. Vom Berliner Publikum erhielt er seinen Spitznamen ?Jopie“. Ab 1938 sang er erstmals die Rolle des Grafen Danilo in der ?Lustigen Witwe“, eine Rolle, die er 35 Jahre lang behalten und zu seiner Paraderolle ausbauen sollte.<br>  <br>  Heesters' Rolle im Dritten Reich ist aufgrund der Vielzahl seiner Arbeiten in Deutschland in diesen Jahren umstritten. Obgleich er sich mit Sympathiebekundungen für das Regime zurückhielt, hat er sich in dieser Zeit nicht explizit vom Nationalsozialismus und der deutschen Politik distanziert, wie dies etwa Hans Albers tat. Andererseits hat er weder die deutsche Staatsangeh?rigkeit angenommen, noch war er NSDAP-Mitglied. Noch 1938 hat er mit einer aus Deutschland geflüchteten jüdischen Theatergruppe in den Niederlanden gastiert. Adolf Hitler besuchte in den 1930er Jahren mehrmals Heesters' Aufführungen, als dieser die Hauptrolle in der Operette ?Die lustige Witwe“ sang. In seinem Heimatland ist Heesters aber kein Publikumsliebling, sondern wird noch heute eher als Kollaborateur denn reiner Mitl?ufer aus Karrieregründen gesehen, der in deutschen Diensten gestanden habe, als sein Heimatland von der deutschen Wehrmacht besetzt war.<br>  <br>  Es gibt eine Aufnahme Heesters' aus dem KZ Dachau im Jahr 1941. Unterschiedliche Darstellungen gibt es über Zweck und Ablauf dieser Veranstaltung. Umstritten ist, ob Heesters als Besucher oder als Stargast anwesend war, um die KZ-Wachmannschaft zu unterhalten. Heesters beschreibt in seinen Memoiren: ?Wir bekamen ein normales H?ftlingslager gezeigt, oder was man sich darunter vorstellte.“ Im August 2006 dementierte Heesters in einer TV-Talkshow erneut den Unterhaltungsauftritt mit den Worten ?Ich schw?re es bei meiner Familie – es ist nicht wahr!“ Der Publizist Volker Kühn hat hingegen einen Zeitzeugen gefunden, der berichtet, dass er bei dem Unterhaltungsauftritt für die SS-Angeh?rigen den Vorhang für Heesters ziehen musste.<br>  <br>  Davon suche sich ein Jeder heraus, was gefaellt! - Aeneas|`|bbba59a5dc99aabde13f6647c3b4c1cfaa	Alle waren überzeugt, dass sie wenn sie es NICHT tun würden, ausserordentliche Nachteile zu erwarten h?tten.|`|lReeX8lsaa	Das Hakenkreuz ist eine Rune und bedeutet Sieg.

Ihr würde ich volle 10 Punkte geben. Als Nachtrag noch: Hitler führte ein, dass auf ihn geschworen wurde, nicht auf Deutschland. Das beinhaltete auch auf die Hakenkreuzflagge. Und es ist wie Leony geschrieben hat: MILLIONEN WAREN üBERZEUGT VON HITLER. Sp?ter war KEINER mehr ¨ein Nationalsozialist!¨....|`|VjhM8DTZaa	War es zwang oder viel mehr ein Zugeh?rigkeitsgefühl. K?mpft man heute nicht viel mehr, jeder für sich allein?

Ich war bei Kriegsende 6 Jahre alt und habe gerade noch die Einschulung im 3. Reich erlebt. Ich erinnere mich noch genau: Am ersten Schultag mu?ten wir "Heil-Hitler-Machen" üben. Wem es nicht gelang, den rechten Arm ordentlich gestreck zu halten, dem wurde durch Ohrfeigen nachgeholfen.<br>  Diese Lehrerin, die bei ihrem Tod 4 oder 5 Jahre nach Kriegsende noch mit "Heil" zur Grube gefahren ist, war sicherlich freiwillig dabei.<br>  Andererseite: Beobachte mal Amerikaner, wenn ihre Flagge gehi?t und/oder ihre Nationalhymne gespielt wird. Der Pathos dabei ist nicht anders als in Deutschland zur Zeit des 3. Reiches. Und die Amerikaner machen das sicher meist freiwillig. Und in vielen anderen L?ndern ist es genauso.<br>  An der Verehrung der Fahne kannst Du noch nicht ablesen, wie demokratisch und frei ein Land ist. Da gibt es - gerade für Nazi-Deutschland - andere und vor allem grausamere Beispiele. Wenn Du einmal den Film über die Befreiung der KZ siehst, dann erkennst Du, wie nebens?chlich der ganze Führer- und Fahnenkult war.

Dort sind die Kosmonauten noch durch den Van-Allen-Gürtel vor der kosmischen Strahlung geschützt. (Das Magnetfeld der Erde f?ngt Teilchen des Sonnenwindes ein, h?lt sie fest, und an denen prallt die Strahlung dann ab.) Von einem l?ngeren Aufenthalt au?erhalb des Gürtels ist wegen immenser Krebswahrscheinlichkeit abzuraten. Die kosmische Strahlung lie?e sich nur durch dicke Bleipanzer oder ?hnliches abschirmen. Ein Kilo Materie auch nur in die Umlaufbahn zu bekommen kostet ca. 20.000$.

Es sind alles nur Hypothesen, so lange bis Leute hinfahren und es ausprobieren. Und dann würden wahrscheinlich erst mal einige Missionen kr?ftig scheitern, und man würde immer wieder neu probieren und neu errechnen und versuchen, aus den Fehlern der Vorg?nger zu lernen.<br>  Da alles dies aber immens teuer sein dürfte, glaube ich nicht, dass es in naher Zukunft ernsthaft zu solchen Anstrengungen kommt.

He has described it as a place essentially different to the life of this world, both in the very nature and purpose of life, as well as the types of delights which people will enjoy therein.  The Quran tells people about Paradise, which God offers to them, describes its great blessings, and proclaims its beauties to everyone.  It informs people that Paradise is one of two ways of life prepared for them in the afterworld, and that every good thing will be theirs in Paradise to a degree that surpasses our present ability to imagine.  It also shows that Paradise is a place where all blessings have been created perfectly and where people will be offered everything their souls and hearts will desire, and that people will be far removed from want and need, anxiety or sadness, sorrow and regret.  Every kind of beauty and blessing exists in Paradise and will be revealed with a perfection never seen or known before.  God has prepared such blessings there as a gift, and these will be offered only to people with whom He is pleased.<br>  <br>  But what is the nature of these delights in Paradise, and how will it be different from the delights of this world?  We will try to highlight a few of these differences.<br>  <br>  Pure delight without pain and suffering<br>  <a href="http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11/" rel="nofollow">http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/11...</a>|`|007197f7e5e89cda3b74953bc7650e33aa	It's nice to have free imagination.|`|5w2SsNXfaa	freewill never existed anywhere...<br>  seriously...|`|6e952bc42ea8d0ac47426d729db55523aa	The bible says the devil converted a third of the angels to rebell, so i`d say yes.

You have only two choices: you stay in His kingdom if you love Him and want to serve Him unconditionally, then you will be very happy and truly fulfilled or you leave His kingdom if you are very envious of God and want to play God, then you will be in suffering and very miserable.

H8txRGiSaa	Ciao piccola,<br>  purtroppo non esiste un metodo "semplice" per imparare la grammatica o la sintassi italiana, non solo perchè, come dici tu, è diversa da quella inglese (per l'arabo, mi fido di te!), ma soprattutto perchè è ricca di eccezioni, Molte di queste eccezioni, si possono imparare solo con l'uso quotidiano.<br>  Se vuoi, possiamo suggerirti qualche link da utilizzare, come <a href="http://www.itg-rondani.it/dida/italiano/index.htm," rel="nofollow">http://www.itg-rondani.it/dida/italiano/...</a> oppure <a href="http://www.dizionario-italiano.it/grammatica-italiana/grammatica-293.php." rel="nofollow">http://www.dizionario-italiano.it/gramma...</a> <br>  <br>  Intanto, posso darti qualche piccolo consiglio per iniziare:<br>  1. pensa sempre che TUTTI i sostantivi italiani, anche quando si tratta di oggetti, sono o maschili o femminili. Aggettivi, articoli, persino participi si scelgono in base al genere (maschile / femminile) e al numero (maschile plurale / femminile plurale). <br>  es: problema: sostantivo maschile (anche se finisce per a) =<br>  il mio unico problema<br>  plurale: i miei unici problemi<br>  <br>  2. Tutti i verbi sono coniugati, il che significa che per ogni pronome personale c'è una desinenza.<br>  io devo<br>  tu devi ecc.<br>  Purtroppo, qui non hai vie di scampo: li devi studiare a memoria. Infatti, anche noi madrelingua abbiamo dovuto studiare tutti i verbi italiani a memoria, e qualcuno ancora non li sa usare! :D<br>  <br>  3. Stai attenta soprattutto ai pronomi complemento: sono davvero piuttosto difficili per uno straniero, soprattutto perchè si possono combinare direttamente con il verbo.<br>  es: porta a me gli occhiali = portameli<br>  <br>  4. Mentre la grammatica è molto diversa, la sintassi italiana è più simile a quella inglese di quanto si creda. Si tratta solo di capire qual è la funzione di una frase all'interno di un discorso (se si tratta di un'ipotetica, di un discorso indiretto, di una proposizione relativa ecc.)<br>  <br>  Infine, se qualche volta hai bisogno di chiarire un dubbio, puoi sempre fare un salto qui: sono sicura che qualcuno potrà darti una mano.<br>  <br>  Buono studio!|`|EEK0YDgXaa	se ti riferisci all'analisi del periodo o a quella logika .devi sapere ke una volta kapita diventa facile facile ,se hai un libro poko kiaro kambialo e cerca di vedere gli esempi  <br>  AUGURI !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|USiEe0KIaa	il fatto che tu abbia problemi in entrambe, mi fa pensare che la tua lingua d'origine non appartenga al ceppo neolatino, e forse neanche  al ceppo indoeuropeo...<br>  forse acquisire qualche base di latino potrebbe aiutarti un po'! :)<br>  <br>  potresti acquistare dei libri di grammatica italiana per stranieri, per anglofoni ce ne sono tante, ma ne trovi anche per arabofoni. almeno ti spiegano il tutto dalla TUA ottica, facendo dei confronti senza costringerti a imparare tutto a memoria.<br>  poi ho trovato questi link che offrono materiale vario, spero che tu ci trovi qualcosa che ti sia d'aiuto...<br>  <a href="http://www.dienneti.it/risorse/italiano/stranieri.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dienneti.it/risorse/italiano/...</a>|`|gT0Cc9IHaa	Ti aiutiamo volentieri.

64203593b7f4206bcd62bddd0a70cb36aa	Eine schwere Frage und ich bitte meine Antwort nicht als rassistisch zu werten, denn so ist sie nicht  gemeint: <br>  <br>  Also, es gibt ja Regionen auf der Welt, in der die Menschen keine M?glichkeit einer Schulbildung haben, das hei?t nicht lesen und nicht schreiben k?nnen. Die Bildung an sich begrenzt sich auf Viehhaltung und das überleben. Wenn die Betreffenden nun die M?glichkeit zur freien Wahl h?tten, dann k?nnte man ihnen alles auftischen und sie würden am Ende auch einen "zweiten Hitler" w?hlen. Wie die Geschichte gezeigt hat, hat das auch in einem Land funktioniert, in dem die Bildungsrate im Vergleich zu Afrika oder einigen L?ndern Asiens ziemlich hoch ist. <br>  Am Ende ist das eine verdammt schwere Frage...ehrlich. Jeder sollte das Recht haben, über die Art und Weise, wie er regiert wird, abzustimmen, aber am Ende kann mit den Hoffnungen und Wünschen der Menschen in L?ndern mit sehr geringem Bildungsquotienten noch sehr viel mehr Schindluder getrieben werden, als in der "ersten Welt". <br>  Ich glaube, der Weg zur Demokratie ist Bildung. Wenn man über eine gewisse Grundbildung verfügt, kann man auch besser abw?gen, wer nun wirklich "mein bestes" will und wer nicht, und ob ein Wahlprogramm in nur kleinstem Ma?stab wirklich realisiert werden kann oder ob es nur Stimmenfang ist. <br>  Also sollte in den betreffenden L?ndern erstmal die Grundlage zur Bildung geschaffen werden, bevor hier wirklich freie Wahlen stattfinden k?nnen. <br>  <br>  Nun ja, wie gesagt, ein schwieriges Thema.|`|131722bee93011ae75717e216956bf06aa	Nein, die Demokratie als Staatsform ist nicht für alle V?lker geeignet.<br>  Es gibt jahrhundertealte Strukturen, die sich schlecht in eine<br>  Demokratie einbinden lassen (z.B.

qMcTeBavaa	I'd put a pan under it. Maybe a little water in the pan.    I've heated up canned food by just putting a hole in the top and setting it close to a fire. One of the oddest I've ever witnessed was a friend using the exhaust from a truck to heat canned meals. He'd poke a hole in the top of a can of ravioli, drop it down the exhaust stack of a semi, let the truck's engine run, then catch it as the can came out the stack. That seems a lot more harmful to me than heating it on a stove.    As long as the thing isn't going to blow up, and you're not going to burn yourself, I see no reason not to do that.    I doubt it will make you sick since some of the ingredients are actually cooked in the canning process. Unless you're opening stuff from the 1880's that are sealed with lead, you should be fine.

Cans are made of several layers of chemicals which shouldn't be disperse under normal condition. But if it's heated, that layers of chemical will disperse to anything it contacts. And in your case, it's the soup.    those chemicals are not visible to the naked eye. Especially when you can't tell the difference since the soup itself is already colored.|`|78kT0KSEaa	open it or it will explode|`|dyXd0vvkaa	it wont make you sick but its bad for you|`|YgKlTITVaa	i dont recommend it man.....but i like your methods! lmao|`|C0yagFFoaa	dont be silly, i suppose you could burn your self. but otherwiseno, as the soup was originally cooked in the can.|`|EdOKAnB9aa	VERY BAD FOR YOU don't do it there are chemicals in the metal of the can that when heated will release into the food its not nice|`|5e3d816ed08317ae03eb22c2cd31dbd2aa	see ya at the morgue
eXbgLXgCaa	Ignore them. live your own life and be proud of yourself.even if the baby was yours,still does not change anything about you.  what that old lady did, showed two things 1- her class 2- your class. you seem to be very nice person so keep it that  way. what you have is very rare.  I have been judged many times but I've ignored them completely each time. I don't judge people or at least I think I don't.|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	I agree that everyone judges other. I don't judge people very often. I normally give them the benifit of the doubt unless I know them really well.  I cannot stand it when people judge other for things as stupid as the way they talk or the way they dress.  At my school I am judged because I use formal English instead of slang and swear words. And I'm looked down upon for it. Just because I don't use slang. How rediculous is that?!  I am also judged for the way I dress. I'm what some people might call goth or more on the gothic side. I'm just a normal, happy, carefree teenage girl. I may dress the way I do but that doesn't change who I am. I am also the only "goth" in my grade. So it seems to be foreign to others that I'm really just a normal person like they are.  I'm made fun of for being different. Other kids in special ed get picked on because of they're mental disabilities. So whenever I see someone ,no matter who it is, even if the person is mean to me I tell other people to stop being mean to them and I stand up for them.   I'm also one of the few kids who doesn't gossip. And in turn the kids who don't gossip are the ones who get gossiped about.   There are rumors about me going around the school that I'm a zombie and that I'm a vampire. These are not true and I hurts me deeply that other people make fun of someone else because they have nothing better to do.  When I walk by people they whisper things about me and ask me if the rumors are true and if I'm goth just because of how I dress. (thankfully my friends and the genuinely nice people don't do this crap to me.)  I've gotten the guidence councler for help but there's not much she can do so much for me because vulgar people will continue to be rude.  I think I've gotten to the point now where I don't really acre what anyone else thinks of me. Or I'm about there.|`|9441f4695cdf8a821a7de6ded5964ad6aa	Face it! Every time you come in contact with or are viewed by another human being, you are being judged!|`|8OREBeRdaa	When I had my long hair (blond, curly, and down to the middle of my back) and my goatee I got judged all the time.  People would automatically thing I'm a stoner, or in a band.  The funny thing is that I've never done drugs and I'm just learning guitar.  I would get the odd compliment on my hair by women but guys would tend to look down on me until I started talking.  I tend to carry myself with a bit of eloquence and I'm well spoken and educated so people tend to get surprised by that.    I think that with judgment comes: Assumption!  People assume that since you look a certain way that you must act a certain way or have a specific personality.  If it gets out of hand than it can lead to bigotry and no one wants that.    I admit that I've assumed someone is a certain way but I work hard to give each other the benefit of the doubt.  We're in such a hurry in life that we don't take the time to get to know each other..even on a surface level.  I find that that when I give some one the benefit of the doubt that I'm pleasantly surprised.|`|pfke6Jieaa	u stop getting judged when u draw the line. if u dont then ppl will walk all over u. of course they will still be idiots when u turn ur back but none would say it to ur face or when u r there near them. i get judged everyday and looked at differently. ppl even make fun of me and even my own teachers in school have no respect for me but i still stay tough and continue walking over hot rocks. in the end when ur successful and they are below u u would have the last laugh.     and its true youths today care less about elders. look at maury u'll see. only few have values these days.|`|xA0w5X1baa	Every Day, But i dont care because i love to be me and unique:)|`|JzJ7hAw6aa	every one judges every one. the cover is the first thing u see of a book so it's hard not to think something of it from its cover.|`|FADVP8traa	everyone is judged. and people say they dont judge people but everyone does.|`|DFFG59sXaa	I've been juged sooo mant times b4.... i mean just like u.... elders have gotten mad at me.. and told me i'm no good... and other stuff like dat i wish ppl could get 2 know ya betta b4 sayin stuff like dat|`|NC30ZpMTaa	You answered your own question. Everyone judges everyone to some degree. I do it, you do it, even if we're unaware we make basic assumptions. The only time it ever becomes an issue is when someone's assumption offends us.|`|1DA9gAP7aa	It should be "elders these days dont care about youths" they are rude and yes you do get people judging you more, i mean i was with my firend and her friend they are goths i aint and there were 2 girls infront of us as we were waiting for the bus they kept turning around and then giggling to each other. I felt like giving them a big slap but because i was so tired and my hair was a lil messy due to the wind i couldnt say jack.|`|4zWo3ghwaa	I don't judge people easily  and as wrong as it is I do it too  Like for example, if I see a girl who is dressed like a slut and maybe around a group of guys acting like a slut everyone will assume that she IS a slut.  and I'm always judged by the people I hang out with.   7th grade, all my friends hated me because I hung out with a girl who was a liar and a two face and everyone thought that I was like her because I hung out with her  and I'm always judged by people I don't even know, I know it by the way they look at me. but if I'm at the park with all my friends there always like screaming curses and stuff and I'm always telling them to stop cursing in front of little kids because I'm so sick of people looking at me and get a totally wrong impression of me, ya know?|`|hOB0hRM3aa	Everyday. By everybody. I try not to let it get me down though. No matter how much you try to be nice to people you just can't|`|DPewRFEQaa	I judge people, but I don't voice that outloud. I keep my thoughts to myself because I don't want to hurt anyone. I myself get judged all the time outloud and it hurts me a lot. I think all people should learn to keep their own thoughts to themselves.|`|k5qq9h85aa	i try not to judge people because it is wrong but sometimes i just cant help myself. i am being judged all the time because i am in 7th grade and people think that if i grew a mustache i would look like Hitler. i let it slide most of the time but when i go out in public i get some odd looks too. i think they are obviously judging me by my appearance. they probably think that i am emo or goth or maybe seen. i do tend to wear black a lot but i do not cut myself and i do keep my emotions hidden sometimes but that is just who i am. hope i helped i do no think i did but i tried.|`|VSw6eN4Baa	I'm judged daily, and it's quite sickening. I don't need it, you know?|`|ki0tOVUYaa	I look at it this way: I will be judged no matter what I do, so I will embrace the freedom to be myself and let those who judge me do so because they're jealous of my freedom.|`|fmHHcFd5aa	i get judged all the time. i used to help my grandma with my little brother when my mom left and i was a teen at the time and at the park people always looked at me odd and making snide remars. I was in jobs(jobes) once and then all of a sudden now im racist and dont like black people. Theres alot of judgement and people take it too far. I try not to judge people as far as you know their life, sometimes i do on personality tho, but people judge before they know the person. maybe theres a reason they act a certain way or do a certain thing. people judge teens with kids when those arent even necessarily their kids.|`|QXSFpMzDaa	Everytime you look at someone you are judging them whether you are aware of it or not.  Of course I judge people.  But I don't let my initial thought about a person show and I don't let it effect how I will think of them in the future.  But honestly if I wasn't sexually attracted to my husband at first I probably wouldn't have asked him out on our first date.  Hey...just being honest!!|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Well, I can't tell you how often I've been judged (though I'm sure it would amount to a lot) but I can tell you that I myself judge people a lot.    I try not to let it cloud my... opinion of them though. I think I can read part of a person's personality in their face, but I have to accept the fact that their face was shaped when they were baby's and they have gone through stuff since then. so I never let the way someone looks (except for the obvious exceptions) stop me from treating them nicely.    If I saw a girl in the park with a baby girl, I might think for a second she was the mother (though I'd actually probably think more along the lines of "sister" or "cousin") but, in the end, if I didn't know them, and I wouldn't think about it, and I DEFINITELY wouldn't go giving them death glares. :)|`|fkQUCwUhaa	everyday, but i dont care, because whoever likes me, likes me,  and whoever doesnt,  doesnt -  im not gonna change for no one.|`|B4aB5XMaaa	people stare at me and probly think im wierd... cuz im 15, 5 feet tall, and always go to the weight room... and everyone stares... and people judge me without me even knowing it.. my friends tell me that they heard other people talkign abut me.|`|rQG60W0Eaa	every day|`|rbgjc62Raa	Everyone is judgmental in their own respects. We're always summing new people up and ruling others out. It's apart of who we all are; those who say that they aren't judgmental are hypocritical. I judge people, all the time! I'm not afraid to say it because we truly cannot help it. It's just a matter of how often you do judge and the severity of your judging.|`|7w6dk0R4aa	well i all the time tell to my ownself not to judge someone....but i cant help it motheir the time really..we are humanbiengs n we are bound to do such things whether we like  it or we dont...|`|s6GKHKccaa	I have been judged many times in my life. But the judgment that pisses me off the most isn't those who judge me by my appearance. I get highly irritated by self righteous people who want to judge you without having any understanding about you. F    One example I'll give you is the other day I asked a question asking if there have been any recorded cases of men getting raped by other men outside of prison. And this "person answered my question without even answering it. She stated she wasn't going to provide a link, told me to look it up myself, and said men who are victims have enough problems letting others know about it when they need help. She only proved to me she was judging me as someone who was making a joke about it, and she had to act like she was in the right for chewing me out over nothing.|`|HBUjnOMEaa	Were you proud of yourself for letting the others go first? Did the old woman see you let the others go first? Be honest. Maybe the old woman was an angel reminding you not to get too proud of your own judgment.    However, don't let others spoil your sense of consideration for others or your happiness, with their own ignorance and arrogance. The old woman might have just been a snarling troll...    It's hard to know these things, isn't it?    I can not 'control' what others think, say, or do... but I can 'influence' what they think, say, and do. I try always to stay as neutral and objective as possible, and let people be people, let judges be judges, and let God be God. Everything tends to work itself out when I do this.    Hope this helps!|`|aXljp31xaa	ok my sister has a two eyr old and she is 19 she is always judged and always looked at..my best friend is blondeand everybody calls her slow and stupid even though she isent! its called sterotypical! people think something in their mind and dont care wat some have to say cause they are right espeacially old people! if you do good things in life i believe in karma and something good will happen to you! dont listen to wat they say be youself and brush it off|`|fpyLWbVxaa	As much as I hate to admit, I judge all the time but don't be mistaken, sometimes I make good judgments as well. I know people do the exact same to me all the time but hey, what can I do? Yeah that lady was completely rude to yell at you like that. I don't understand why but sometimes people can be downright rude. All you have to do is ignore them and move on. At the end of the day you're still you and hopefully you won't let anyone change that.|`|3rkpcXodaa	yeah i often get judged but so what if they don't know you why should you care anyway|`|7ROXROUxaa	i think it's just human nature to judge people. everyone does it because deep down everyone has some sort of insecurity about themselves. especially women. & that old lady? screw her, she won't be alive much longer.  haha.|`|pSNex1a1aa	thats so stupid what that old woman did.  I think we get judged every day in the street. someone sees you, they make assumptions. you cant stop it unfortunately >:(|`|60xKMmsvaa	Everyone does it. EVERYONE!  Its like first impression.  You could be the nicest person in they world but you still gotta have an opinion on people.    Basicly once YOU stop caring about what other people think you wont even notice anyone is judging you|`|v7tnfgeHaa	I will be the first to admit, I do tend to judge other people, and I have probably been judged by alot of people. However, I don't really care about other people judging me. They don't know me, and they will have no influence in my life. I think that people have to realize that in the end, other people don't matter.    And funny story... Something similar to your first story happened to me when I was like 10. I was sort of big for my age, and I was looking at something in the store with my little sister who was like, 4 or 5 at the time. I guess she saw me from behind, and approached me, and was like, "Oh, is that your little girl?". I thought it was kind of funny because I was only 10. Me and my mom had a good laugh :)|`|TY8FNnW0aa	I agree. I have short hair and have occasionally had some uneducated lowlife call me a 'fcuking lesbian'. I don't mind the inference at myself, i Just hate stereotypical judgements, especially when they come from morons!     Rant over!|`|2ZYZr0sJaa	everyone probably judges everyone, even if they don't say it out loud. People get judged from them being too pretty etc, to what they're wearing, how they may be walking, talking, anything. You probably get judged more than you know. Thats why I'd LOVE to have the power to mind-read :)|`|iUNb0kmTaa	im 14 and about 2 years ago i had no confidence what so ever .. i was always so worried about how i looked to people  but now i am just past caring what people think about me  yep i get judged !   alot, but i've learnt just to ignore it  but i think people judge others way too much!|`|5pcCyum9aa	Honestly i get judged every day, For what i wear, think, do, talk about. Everything. But I can also admit to judging others. Like if a new girl comes to our school dressed all nice with a bunch of make-up on then i assume that she is a snot, but then i have to stop and think well that's what i wear everyday to! and im not a snot so she might not be.    I judge people that judge me, if i hear that some1 thinks im a S*L*U*T then i look at them and start to judge them because it makes me feel better. But don't get me wrong...im working on it!    but in your 2nd scenario that's called being a hypocrite, and yes i know many of those people...|`|16128eb9f03958951303e1cc4301c224aa	I'm always judged by other people. People say I "look" mean. Once they get to know me they see that I am pretty cool. At one point, I tried to smile just a little. Not a huge smile but just enough to look approachable and I was judged for that. People thought I was crazy or something was wrong with me. Now I just wear my regular, mean face like everyone else and however people perceive me is all up to them. You just can't please everybody.     This is always going to happen. People don't know you and you don't know them so their opinion or judgment shouldn't matter in the least bit. That old lady probably didn't see all the people you let on the bus before you. Or maybe she did see and just decided to be ugly by making that statement. I try not to judge people because I don't want anyone judging me but I am guilty of this sometimes.|`|vbAu5SY3aa	I think you are right, people will see something and then in their haste jump to conclusions about what they see. Then they react, often inappropriately, as if it is their right.   Judging others is one thing, but acting on a judgment is wrong. Some people never ask themselves what the extenuating circumstances could be in what they are seeing. Plus, I have never understood why some people believe it is their job to let other people know they disapprove of something.

5jHbJjjVaa	If god created us in his image, why aren't we all gods?    Those who are new creatures are! Revelation 1:6, And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.    Secondly, the term "angels" in the Bible comes from the Hebrew "elohim," which is translated "gods." And since Paul says in 1Corintians 6:3, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?" One who judges angels (elohim; gods), must be higher than them!    Again, you so love to bash that which you know nothing about and then take off on a rant that is utterly absurd ignoring the very source you bash in complete ignorance. Does it ever get old with you? You know, always being wrong.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	You're entirely right. Messing around creating a particularly arrogant chimpanzee is no activity for a sane or mature deity.

Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, 'I am God's Son'? 37 Do not believe me unless I do what my Father does. 38 But if I do it, even though you do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father."    In a certain context we are Gods. That's according to Jesus. The word of God has been given even to the Gentile now. So we have the words of God, thereby making us into a sort of god. But the context on Jesus being God, He is over us, and even more God than us. Because His purpose was to do something none of us could do.    Jesus didn't seem to have the superstition a lot of religious Christians tend to have in using these words as he used them properly; as in us being a sort of God. But the God above us all is the one to put our trust in because He can do anything, while we can only do very little in comparison.|`|ql2fHxxlaa	its true, we all have a part of God in us.

There is a God (I am not saying there is not)  2. The God has an image.    Assuming that there is a God, I think it is the height of arrogance on our part to say that God created us in his image. This implies that God has an image, and that image is the same as that of ours - two hands, two legs, one head, two eyes, etc.     Why should God be limited to two arms? Why not twenty? Why not wings? Why not the eyesight of an eagle and the strength of an elephant?    Oh, you may say that this is what is written in "the Book". But "the Book" was written by men, so how can you be certain that they were are telling the truth?

Just what exactly do you do that makes you think you are spiritual.: Flaming red eyes sometimes, hear other minds, spoke without breathing, a profound relationship with God., I know Gabriel and Micheal, done "ten rounds" with Lucifer, carry two flaming Swords, know the Logos, carry the Logos, dogs go "berserk with joy" around me sometimes, then there was this senility cure that did make any sense, oh yeah -- I've seen the Father, and I have bound to the Father (right side at the front) -- sort of experienced heaven.

DkVqOe8Iaa	I had my prom in June 2008 and it was an amazing night! :)    I loved it. But then I'm girly. I like to wear dresses, wear make-up, get a fake tan, get my hair all fancy, i love dancing, drinking (i live in the uk before anything thinks underage drinking) and all that sort of thing.     Its really up to you whether you want to go. But to me it was a chance to let my hair down after finishing my exams, a chance to dress up and have fun.    But if its not for you then there isn't any point in going because you will just be wasting money and proms are expensive.    Although what I would say is if your prom isn't for another 3 years then I wouldn't worry about it just now. You will be a different person in 3 years time, you might be super-girly by then. Just enjoy life at the moment and when it comes round to prom you can decide whether you want to go. But there is no point in saying you don't want to go now when you will be a totally different person in 3 years.
AA11440601	Because God wants us to live on Earth until our natural death.     Catholics believe suicide when committed in full knowledge and deliberate consent is a complete turning away from God (a mortal sin) and will send a person to hell.    There are 3 conditions of a mortal sin: grave matter, full knowledge, and deliberate consent.     While suicide (or any kind of murder) is always a grave matter, people who commit suicide may not always have full knowledge of what they're doing. Drugs can definitely impair one's thinking, as can other things, such as diseases, intense pain, or anguish.     Therefore, suicide is not automatically treated as a mortal sin.     We are commanded by Christ not to judge others so we leave final judgment to God who alone knows each person's heart.    The Code of Canon Law does not list suicide as a reason to deny a person a Catholic funeral or burial in a Catholic cemetery. http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__...  http://www.holycrosscemeteries.com/faq/ ...  http://home.att.net/~faithleap/suicide.h...    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church:  On mortal sin, paragraphs 1857-1859: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...  On suicide, paragraphs 2282-2283: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt3s...    With love and prayers in Christ.
Aabo2WP7aa	No, you look like Lisa Simpson giving a ********.|`|qXlBsRLgaa	your gay

The rest of the story  is not really clear.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	Not one bit.|`|7sEFufRbaa	Yes--To think that an expansion of any kind put the world into systemic order and balance is laughable.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	yes|`|5tMCDu8gaa	No.    I also don't believe in fairies, Santa Clause, or Zeus.|`|thVN9X2Baa	which one?|`|2h8tqOeFaa	Yes i do..|`|EFjrJmdXaa	I believe God is possible. The problem is that the word God can encompass a wide variety of personalities or physical boundaries. I find it hard to argue whether or not God exists, especially because there are so many gods from so many religions. Plus my own knowledge is limited to what I have experienced so I can't use other peoples experience to argue a stand point. And I can't use my inexperience as an excuse to argue that something doesn't exist. I just try to use my own rationality in the end because I figure if there is a God that God would want me to use my own rationality anyways. I would think that if there is a God that God would be rational. And if God is rational I am sure God would realize my position and inability to physically prove anything.|`|mxe86blRaa	Yes.|`|c5d588cf97b8984e46b8066408585a85aa	I belive in a loving god|`|1oYjjp0Daa	nope - not any one of the thousands of gods.    There is no evidence for any of them|`|3VMT0YO2aa	i believe in God...    i think God is real for everybody who really believes in him ...as in from the bottom of their heart...|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	Which one? Please be specific when you ask questions.|`|9yT5ZA1taa	Yes I do!  And may the Flying Spaghetti Monster bless you with a noddly appendage|`|DQZK3eKfaa	I'm not sure right now. Its hard because it's like I go to a catholic school and they teach us about God and stuff and its really nice to have faith and everything because you can find comfort in God. He is like a friend who is always willing to listen and will never judge you. But on the other hand, the bible and the teaching of the Catholic church are a little odd to me, if you know what I mean. Like they are always saying to "fear God" and if you don't believe in him you will burn in hell. And then all the rules and stuff. To me it sometimes doesn't add up. why should good people like Gandhi burn in hell? And why should I fear God. They tell me to put my faith in him, but they make everything so scary sometimes and then all the answered questions about the universe and stuff. It's very confusing for me, especially since  I'm in my 8th grade awkward "finding yourself" time and everything is just so confusing to me. So my answer is "to a certain extent". Sorry this was so long.|`|QrC3blK8aa	Do you believe in pink invisible unicorn?  why or why not?|`|FOZGMadaaa	Only the spirit of God can confirm it is so.
GeruGGOQaa	You need to go back and study what a theory is.  Using your same argument all the different religions have different views....how can that be...other religions with other teachings must not be "true" religions...|`|xo4iux9gaa	Evolutionist are always looking for a way to convince themselves of foolish things in spite of evidence to the contrary.    They invent all sorts of things as they go along.....everytime something doesn't work out right they invent another theory to keep it current with the latest discovers which keep invalidating their last assumption....it is really laughable.    Ever since Darwin's theory people have been making monkeys of themselves.|`|37LKDbtsaa	Nope. If I was a historian, who denied the existence of feudal France, does that make me right? No, because the majority of historians know feudal France was real and they have evidence.    Controversy is the principle in science. Without it, we would still believe in geocentrism.|`|mdt6hz6faa	A bit like the innumerable intepretations of "Gods word"|`|YyEEAJBkaa	No they are just trying to find out who is incorrect.|`|iRKOJhYeaa	None of know the truth. No Atheist, no Christian, no Muslim, no Buddhist, no, Hindu, no Jew....    NO ONE!|`|wwdllMzYaa	i have no idea, nor do they, nor do you  thats the whole point  none of us actually KNOW the "true answer" to the big questions|`|ni6SCUm9aa	We shall see when more information comes in. For now, we must be honest and say 'we do not know for sure'.|`|PlBYWZ8Saa	You see the same problem with religious dude. Which is the true one?     The difference is that science grows and evolves as we learn more. Religion doesn't. If the research into the universe's origins is proven false, then the research will change and evolve to reflect better the way the world actually works. Eventually, we will come to an answer.|`|yYYXVCGZaa	it seems you think that there is only one true scientist...lol...go back to bible class, it is easier for you.|`|HSaVBaiaaa	we just don't know for sure yet, and in the meantime i really don't think we should put religion in the spot of "we don't know," to answer those questions.|`|PDJjy0bPaa	The Big Bang Theory|`|5tMCDu8gaa	That isn't true at all. Most scientists with any credentials agree on one particular theory. That's how the scientific process works.    Currently, there is the theory of circularity, which is an expansion of the Big Bang theory. It states that the universe is constantly going through cycles of inversion and expansion. We are in the most recent cycle of expansion (The Big Bang).    But at the end of the day, we aren't 100% sure. And I'm ok with that. I'd much rather admit I don't have all the answers than just close my eyes and say "a magic sky fairy did it."|`|2h8tqOeFaa	There is only one truth whether that be Creation or the Science version of the way Creation works..     I believe science is trying to work out what really happened in Creation but they don't realise it..     And Creation has a lot more to do with science than we would like to admit..|`|KJHt4hiYaa	I'll go for the theory proposed by a Christian cleric- Big bang. He was a Christian and a true scientist and it's beyond your intellectual abilities to challenge it with valid arguments which is why you're reduced to mud slinging and rhetoric.|`|CODYtcwkaa	Why does an atheist = scientist for you?  Atheist just means "no belief in any god(s.)"  There is no science in that.|`|06fTQbIKaa	Why does there have to be just one? Have a read up on quantum mechanics, and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, and get back to us when you can accurately measure anything at all...|`|8599c16fb8c024a84d9e0e7d395be5baaa	See in science, unlike in religion, disagreement is accepted. All of them are "true" scientists... they might have different degrees of respect for each other's positions, but they would never consider their opponents not to be true scientists.|`|w8D0ktFmaa	I believe the current consensus in the legitimate scientific community is that the "Big Bang" is the most plausible theory regarding the origins of the universe. I might add that "true" scientists would not be disingeneous and claim that this is THE explanation for the origin of the cosmos, unlike religionists who insist that "God did it" and that's all we need to know. That attitude is what I call "brain stagnation."    Edit @ The Rev. Albert Einstein - The question was about the origins of the universe, which has nothing to do with EVOLUTION. See what happens when you become so religiously deluded that you can only "think" with the chimpanzee part of your brain? Brain stagnation happens.|`|r8qJecrMaa	A scientist answers:  Who can say for sure. Every day we are collecting ever more information to improve our understanding of the way the universe works! We will probably never know for certain but one thing is absolutely clear: Your God didn't do it!
HlgcJ3FLaa	No. If you're writing a paper or something on "octopuses" then of course you should use the correct pluralization. Why would you purposely make a mistake just because most people do?  Now, if you correct everybody else who says "octopi," you might be considered pedantic. But you should definitely say the right word yourself!  This might be the dictionary's mistake, but Merriam Webster says that the two correct pluralizations of octopus are octopuses and octopi. And Wikipedia says that all three are correct, but then that's Wikipedia. And this website says that if you follow the Greek rule, it should really be octopudes:  http://www.telusplanet.net/public/alfvae...  But really, language is just what people makes it -- even if something wasn't originally correct, it becomes completely acceptable if the mistake is made often enough.  And really, how many times are octopuses going to come up in ordinary conversation? ;)|`|5O7op0oIaa	Not so much 'pedantic' - just overly-impressed by snippets of information which you assume (incorrectly) are not common knowledge.    Etymology notwithstanding, the 'correct' plural (ie, the most commonly-accepted) is the rather bland 'octopuses'.|`|rzrki3OZaa	I like chocolate.|`|fXWxSJ5yaa	I like it, yes you are being a tiny bit pedantic but roll with it.    I myself have real issues when posters cannot use affect and effect correctly. Giant issues, it's not uncommon for me to shout at my screen. lol.     silly really because the english language is a minefield of conflicting rules and omissions and no one is perfect, least of all me.     So go for it I say.|`|ms9ROOQKaa	If you worry about being excessively pedantic you may wish to construct your conversation so that you never have to mention octopodes.  You could also consider 'octopuses' as an anglicised alternative (if you can bear to have your erudition overlooked ) on those occassions when you are forced to talk about them but still worry about excessive pedantry.
dpRpQBSzaa	I used to attend a church.  I even was a missionary for a time.  All along I felt like this wasn't right.  I could easily say I believed but honestly did not.  Now being atheist I am just honest in what I really believe.|`|qV8Vz36Iaa	I was a theist before I learned that Santa Claus was a charade. I was an agnostic and called myself spiritual. I then heard George Carlin and decided that it was all a fraud and try to be honest with each other. I became an atheist, but left open the idea that we may not be able to understand everything about the universe through scientific research.    After reading Richard Dawkins, it was clear that a person should be intellectually honest with themselves and others. I most respect those who are willing to speak the truth despite how it might effect their careers and lives:    Professor Steven Jones, Rosey O'Donnel, Mr. Ralph Nader, Professor Noam Chomsky, and Mr. Pat Tillman.    These people deserve a special place in history.|`|xo4iux9gaa	used to be a miseable atheist before becoming a Christian.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I was never into it at all. I was forced into being a Christian by my parents. Now, I'm an atheist and I'm glad I made the switch.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	alot|`|HSaVBaiaaa	I was just about the same, it was just when i was small and didn't know too much about the world|`|00a8352416947125cb4ac2d7a0a201c3aa	I'm atheist, but I (and several that meet with our local group) agree that there is a spiritual dimension to life.  We don't hang any superstition there (well, some of us do), but rather look at our "spirit" as the inner life, the life of the mind, inspirational arts, nature...anything that uplifts and nourishes the non-physical values of our lives.    I like to try to tap into that Maslovian "peak experience" which he theorized was the root of all major religions.  What is that, if not spiritual?|`|wwdllMzYaa	im spiritual but  not religious now, and im an atheist now

8OREBeRdaa	I don't think all of them have low-self esteem but I do believe that is a contributing factor.  I think they've also bought into the corporate marketing and advertising and need to have things like Prada in order to be cool (if that was the case then whatever happened to Vaurnet and Tommy Hilfiger?)    Just because you have the money to spend on something doesn't mean that you should.  That's just fueling the corporate behemoth.   I know that I bought 3 pairs of jeans during the boxing day weekend and it only cost me $60 over all and I received compliments on them that day.  I think it's a bit on what you wear, but how you wear it, what you accessorize with, and how you carry yourself.     If you can't afford it then do your best to try and find a financial compromise.  I don't go for top of the line stuff but I won't buy cheap stuff either.  I have a friend who insists on buying the best stuff (i.e iPod, Blackberry, best laptop, etc.) but he has a LOT of disposable income. I don't so I just get what I need.  He went on his first overseas vacation last year.      To summarize, I'd rather spend the money on experiences (i.e. good dates, concerts, a good beer, vacations), etc. then just stuff.  Experiences and events are what people will talk about when you pass on, not the fact that you were wearing a brand name.|`|BArT6QVRaa	No  Maybe she just likes the expensive stuff and has the money for it  If you could spend money on a nice pair of jeans you would, and it would have nothing to do with your self-esteem|`|CtD9iboxaa	i just think that people buy expensive and designer things because they want to conform and fit in with their percieved view of society. They desire to be like the beautiful people in hollywood and perhaps low self esteem may be a part of it for some, but overall i just think that they are trying to fit in.|`|f5c31f6f29773c7a940941879d334e41aa	I think in some cases yes. That would explain why some women love to shoe shop after a breakup. Sometimes people will even steal a designer item just so they could "fit in" with a crowd or have the latest fashion.     Overall though, I think designers become sought after because they produce quality, desirable items. I work for a high-end retailer and though I dont make a ton of money, I do buy some expensive designer stuff when I get the chance. It usually fits alot better and last ALOT longer. I have shirts that I paid $100 for, but have had them for 7 years!!!    Like my old man used to say: Its better to spend $200 on a pair of good shoes than $200 of 5 pair of cheap ones...so true
9g8spRvPaa	I always look people in the eye when I am talking to them or saying hello.  I don't stare and look away every so often not to make them think I am some sort of weirdo.  I used to be a Vegas casino games dealer and sometimes I would look a gambler in the eye, a big mistake. Most serious gamblers have a look that would kill and they seemed to be deranged.I stopped looking people in the eye at work.|`|gspTDufpaa	LoveCat, I only make eye contact with people it's my job.|`|R49w1Dr7aa	It can be difficult for some but if someone is talking (serious talk) to me I generally look them in the eyes to let them know I'm there, taking it all in.    I am self-consciousness but do it anyway. O..O|`|aJfdmm2vaa	No, I'm not but you should look people in the eyes when you are talking.  It's a sign of respect, well that is what my parents use to say.  If people don't make eyes contact, to me they don't want to speak to you or talk about what the conversation is
cf6ad6a3adfe8d8e9ce6e9966f1a624caa	does  it  really  matter  what  other  people  think  of  what  you  do as  a  fetish?    assuming  that  by  "fetish"  you  mean  a  pastime  that  gives  you  sexual  stimulation, that  should  be private  anyway.  nobody  wants  to  know  and  unless  you  go  around  telling  them  they  wont  have  a  chance  to  judge  it  as weird.    there  are  plenty  of  websites  for  diapers and  panties (maybe  not  together)  but  if  all  you  are  looking  for  is  validation  then its  out  there  in  big  numbers     some  things  are  better  left  as  a  private  fantasy.  if  you  fulfill  all  your  fantasies  what  will  you  have  to  look forward  to  , or  think  about  to  make  you  excited  when  you  need  it.      keeping  it  dark  and  forbidden  just  enhances  the  sexual  thrill of  a thing|`|KBVAbwUXaa	people losing their jobs|`|C4BJ3yLWaa	People who like to cut or purposely injure themselves.|`|vnYYH4fMaa	People who aren't considerate of others around them by not showing proper manners in general.

5OucqEzFaa	How is it possible to hate something if it does not exist? If there is no God then you can't hate it.    I think it's the IDEA of God that gets up the collective noses of atheists. It seems to insult their sensibilities. The idea that we are created in God's image does not sit well with their pride.    I hope you don't mind if I give your other questions a body-swerve - as Jimmy Buffet said, it's 5 o'clock somewhere!

They worship the land.    Wiccans think that there is manipulation of things that they can gain control of depending on their own personal internal powers.    Obama is not the anti-Christ.  he's just a man who is over-blown in his popularity.    Harry Potter is a doorway to better reading and immagination.    Darwin was right.

We don't hate what we don't think exists.  We hate Christians who think they get to impose their faith on us--like you did in this question.    2.  Because different life forms evolve to fill different niches in the ecology of their times.  There are still invertebrates despite the evolution of fish b/c the fish exploited a niche in the ecology that the invertebrates could not--but the invertebrates kept on in their original niches.  And so forth.    3.  Pagans do not worship Satan.  They don't think Satan--or God--exists.  They worship various pre-Christian gods and goddesses.  Odin, Zeus and Inanna are not the same thing as Satan.  Keep that straight, OK?    4.  I've known a lot of Wiccans, and yes they do.    5.  Try really studying your Bible.  The anti-Christ doesn't appear in Revelation; references to anti-Christs are usually plural and they refer to people alive shortly after the crucifixion who opposed the new sect.  Odds are you are buying into the interpretations of Revelation that came out of some questionable 19th-Century Scottish ministers.    6.  We don't believe in the occult either.  Well, some atheists might.  But the real test would be to see if it did for many people that read it.  And so the answer is no.    7.    No.  Nothing to recant from, he only told the truth as he perceived it.    8.  No.  Atheism is a category of belief (well, non-belief actually).  To be a religion you have to have a set of creeds, dogma, tenets of faith, etc.  Atheists have none of that.    9.  Yes, Satanists really worship Satan (who you I presume consider synonymous with the Devil).  However, they have a different take on whether Satan is evil.    And hey, it's 5 o'clock in many places on opposite sides of the world (if it's the top of the hour in all the time zones).|`|RiycmPZbaa	Because they like their sins.|`|e28543bc8f9e3532ab7fa357d27ab64caa	And the Mother of all questions.

Cheers!      *drink*    Amazing how many folks are taking this seriously.|`|v7Wflu78aa	1) You don't understand evolution.  Organisms change over many generations to optimize their survival in an ecological niche.  The distant ancestors of humans and monkeys, due to mutations and the selective pressures of their respective environments, gave rise to other species - some of which were the distant ancestors of monkeys, and others of which were distant ancestors of humans.  If you don't understand this, please let us know how we can make this clearer for you.    6) no.|`|9XvWqZChaa	Atheists don't "hate" god, they simply believe, that there is no god.   Not pagans but christians "worship" satan, they believe that he exists which is bs.  No, nobody can do "real magic". There are only halfwits who believe in "magic". Wiccanism are esotheric nonsens.   Obama certainly isn't the "antichrist" - what ever that sould mean (it means nothing) . Obama is christian, he married in a christian church, he worked for christian churches, now stopp this Obama bashing.  The Harry Potter books are wonderful fairy tales an no doorways "to the occult", this also is complete bs.  No Darwin didn't "recant" - he was a scientist.  No atheism is not a religion, it's religion-free - blissfully  May be they worship the devil, it means absolutely nothing, because "the devil doesn't exist.   There are only mean  and evil human beings - that's enough.|`|UOIcXs7Haa	Yup it's 5 o' clock here (Ireland)|`|fe17567cd409e9ef948b874d8091f511aa	We can't hate something that doesn't exist.

Cheers!  .|`|leCcd0rfaa	Funny, it's 11 am here. That's late enough to start drinking.  *drinks*|`|tU4oYg5aaa	Atheists didn'tt hate god cus remember that they didnt believe he exists.    Evolution is a theory which has been neither proved or disproved.    It's ignorant to assume pagans worship satan. Pagans have nothing to do with satan thats why there are paganists, and satanists(clear difference).    Some wiccans perform magic and some don't. Some just find worshipping earth's nature appealing. But the ones that do perform magic do believe that its real otherwise they wouldnt do it.    NO. Obama is not the antichrist. The book of revelations was written for its own time. The author "John" was merely referring to the roman rule of his time. Oh and the number 666 in hebrew numerolgy for the roman emperor Nero, who was ruling at the time and was infamous for persecuting christians. And every generation thinks the world is ending.    Harry Potter is a children's book. Imagination is not evil. Not one mention of anything occult related is in the books. And if you want proof, the pope read the books and approved them!    No Darwin was 50 years old, in 1859 when he published his theories of evolution and natural selection.     Atheism is not a religion because no worshipping is involved. it is just a belief.    Well, the keyword to your next question is Satanists- so yes they do worship SATAN.     Use some intelligence next time you ask a question. Get your facts straight.|`|xYjbJf59aa	We don't; because we evolved from a common ancestor; they don't, you're thinking of devil-worshipers; Some of them might; unlikely; no, just silly; no; no; and no. Most don't believe in satan, or god.
OFTn5nxhaa	Pretty funny question. There is no custom that I know of like that but there is a different sort of custom. I know I've always been taught that bread is sacred, it's the basic sustenance. So it's always been a custom in my house not to throw out bread or even crumbs. Instead, we make a point to throw them outside so at least even the crumbs will get eaten there by the birds or animals or whatever so nothing goes to waste.     I don't think we really do it during the week, the only time I've ever noticed anyone doing that is on Shabbos. Then we throw all the challah crumbs outside, I guess because challah is considered more sacred. So it would make sense that you see it on Friday night after the meal...|`|TVJsOEKNaa	It's technically Sabbat, so observant Jews won't be on.  I did star this for you however, for better answers.     No, there was never such a practice in my home growing up.  It is forbidden to carry food or items outside of the home on Shabbat.     Do your neighbors have kids? We do eat Challah bread on Shabbat, so if there are kids around... that could explain it.     In my home growing up we were never allowed to let bread fall on the floor.  I would ask your neighbors about this personally.     Just ask them if this is some sort of family practice, and if not let them know it is a concern for your puppy.|`|DTog0VZWaa	I'm not aware of the practice either, but I'll star it.  It is Shabbat, so you'll need to keep this open until it's over to get answers from people who would know, Orthodox Jews (no quotes needed).|`|771e401b864ef2c6278719b487b80406aa	Orthodox 'Jews' won't be on the internet on the Sabbath either, so ask this question some other time.  (I am not aware of the practice)
jbDTsZyBaa	Umm, yeah, I think they want them to be straight. Otherwise what's the point? I think most would object to dating bisexuals as well. I think many that do don't know about it.|`|sVyH0jTiaa	this is the strangest one i ever see!<br>  anyway , i can not judge what women think.<br>  all i can say is i bet there is lot of women will not like it at all, and say no.<br>  or some women might like it, don't mind their husband do both way , but lot of them don't talk about it. , we don't know how many are like that out there . because people in america are mostly closed minded<br>  well , i am not gay or bisexual; i believe there is that women are dating bisexual but not sure about gay.<br>  because today there is very high percent that women are bi-sexual. <br>  it might be out there that people are doing it.<br>  i don't know.<br>  i only do women, when they let me have it, that all i go to.<br>  peace.|`|A3LmSvhxaa	I wouldn't date a guy unless I was positive that he was heterosexual.<br>  <br>  Which is odd because I'm very bisexual.|`|AA11840910	Well it depends if they act on anything. I'm bi but I'm very faithful and would expect the same from my lover whether he was bi or not|`|bkUuUD6waa	Hell yes!|`|esE4tkxWaa	Yes I do. I would want to date a bisexual man that would turn me off knowing he desires men.|`|hK0fOCCyaa	This is the strangest question ever. <br>  <br>  Are you asking if women mind being with Bi men? Cause that would have to be the woman's preference....most do mind and would rather have a straight partner, but there are some women out there that are OK with it. <br>  <br>  But why would a woman be with a gay man, if that is what you are asking?|`|lKqeDhXjaa	That really depends on the woman. I've been with women who thought it was a turn-on that I was bi. I've also had women stop dating me because of it.|`|mqpnAL5Vaa	yea i care...i dont want to marry a gay guy..that would be wierd...|`|rxIvuY9Raa	I think it's a matter of security.<br>  Are you going to invest in a business that goes up and down so unpredictably that there could be a chance that your investment goes to waste?<br>  <br>  I think women don't want to commit themselves to a relationship where they are competing against other men and women. <br>  I don't know a single straight female who dated a bisexual. I think they believe it's too risky. It's putting to much faith on the line for them.

When you fight with a friend, do you honestly think that the person hates you? no, you just had a fight.   My best friends cousin commited suicide, he was also my best friend. Great family. They fought a few days before he killed himself. She's always been a wonderful influence in everyone's life, including his. She fought with him cause he didnt like the guy she was with - no one did. I know he knew it wasnt personal, its love blinded by the reality of a manipulative guy. Not long after he killed himself she broke up with this guy.   A few years later we were out- hanging out catching up. and she brought it up. And you why it really affected me - is because him and here were great friends - and no fight was ever going to change the bond between them. And it hurt me to think she remembers her last words to him were hurtful.   Years of friendship, loyalty, strength, and honesty, were overshadowed due one incident that happened before a terrible incident.   Please dont regret if your last words weren't the most pleasant before someone's death. It has nothing to do with you - and they do know you do love them. deep down. you know, and they know.|`|w29tsXLUaa	I lost my dearest friend my mother on the 10th January this year and now I am looking through the old photographs and I wish I had gone through them with her when she was here.

fKEtVuJ7aa	shemales|`|qvycijbOaa	If women take the right choices they'll have men flocking to them. A man can be single for his whole life and be too afraid to even approach a woman. Men have more responsibility but I wouldn't like to be treated like a woman because from my observation the world still sees men as the dominant sex. Still no female Presidents in America, for example. Men can sleep around, and dont get pregnant, and do have to worry about being a whore. So yeah I'd say a man has it easier. History tells us the same.|`|thVN9X2Baa	Men. I don't have to get pregnant, bleed once a month for a week, or do dishes,|`|h1eBWehMaa	guys have it better in my opinion|`|C0yagFFoaa	men, no pregnancy, noperiods, no countless ailements, no ties,  we can do what we like, for our whole lives.|`|AA11745732	women  men carry the responsibility not of their own life  but succeeding for their family  it seems like we women have to deal with alot  but we jus have to live and maintain destruction  men must overcome much adversity, criticism, and stuff of the like.  becoming a man seems like it takes forever nowadays|`|0818EVcWaa	I think that men have it way easier since the world let's them get away with EVERYTHING. like, a man can be fat and unnattractive and people will be more accepting of him than they would to a woman that's the same exact way. I also think that they have it easier because they sit back and start stuff with women and they never have to suffer consequences. I know that this is slightly off the subject by I am so sick of the world being catered to men. I mean, cosmopolitan, diet books, most women tv shows and a lot more are catered to looking good for MEN. And men could care less about pleasing women. Men are the cause of insecurity and fewding between women (which is so sad).

The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde was published in a small paperback form as a kind of 'pulp fiction' of the time.  I believe he wrote in many genres at the time, and wrote several other horror stories.  The novella is typical of the Gothic genre of the Victorian era as it deals predominantly with the human condition, and the concept that the peak of human civilisation was in decline due to lack of morality and decency.  As to why he wrote what he did from beginnings writing children's books, I can only assume that he met demand from readers, and wrote what would sell.
LuN1unJ3aa	I find it shocking that after the Russian experience in Afghanastan, that we (in the United States) got caught up in another Viet Nam.

But if the people of that region are backwards enough to believe in their religion so strongly that they want to be ruled by religious leaders then it surely cannot be up to a US Christian to tell them that they can't have it.    If the cost of a democracy abroad is the death of US soldiers then at some point you have to ask how much are you willing to pay?  Some people (I am not one of them) believe that the cost is already too high and that the US should be more insular and take care of its own before it goes around freeing other nations.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Thank you for showing yet again how desperate christians have become that they continually try to smear anyone who thinks differently to them!!    Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!!

Why would you think not ridding Afghanistan of the Taleban means people 'want such a theocracy in their home countries'? People in free Western countries wouldn't tolerate such an oppressive regime. It is not for anyone but the people of Afghanistan to deal with the issue of the Taleban. It's just a shame even one British or US service persons life has been lost there fighting a war that isn't our business.

Christians don't believe in religion, we believe in God.      An assumption of truth always encompasses the possibility that our assumption is incorrect.

24H5tznkaa	LOL, I like your answer! :)     Christian Fundie: Generally speaking, I'd say it's the deer in headlights look on their face. It's like they spent a few days with their eyelids taped open or something. Hmm, you never know...that could be part of the brain washing. ;)    *edit*    For the record, I find fundies to be in a religion all their own. I know a lot of Christians that would take great offense at being grouped in with them...and since my Dad and Sister are Christian, I just wanted to clarify that I wasn't talking about them. Their eyes look normal. ;D|`|iHDYncuXaa	I don't complain about being persecuted. I welcome it! That just means I'm saying or doing something right.

I find atheists to be heavy offenders in this regard - at least Catholics acknowledge the difference between HOW and WHY when it comes to science and religion.  I've had many atheists attempt to debunk my religious beliefs because of science - it's quite amusing to inform them that I ascribe to most modern scientific explanations of our world, given that they are widely accepted by the scientific community, and have not yet been disproved. In fact, I have encountered, on many occasions, atheists who have their scientific "facts" mixed up and quite out of date.    But what I love best is their wide-eyed shock, insistence, and frustration over my "delusion". (As Hun has very adequately demonstrated).|`|8HQEiltbaa	They are ALWAYS right - or at least THEY are certain they're right.

EDIT: For all we know, you will cease to exist on death. So will I and everyone else. If that's condemning, then you have a screwed up view of condemnation. And that isn't my fault, it's yours. If you're so sure you're going to survive death in some variety of paradise, why do you even care what anybody else says and insist on posting questions like this?    EDIT 2: Don't call me "hon." I'm not a woman, and even if I was, it would still be patronizing.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	"Fundies"(fundamentalists) is the vernacular of the Left Wing and the New Age Contemporary Christian Church.  The true Christian Church and the false Christian church are both described in the Bible.  The true Christians are a peculiar people set apart from the rest.  They are hated, ridiculed, mocked and scorned by the world.  The true Church does not glean from the Biblical text what may be invented against itself but accepts it as the complete and true Word of God to us according to His good plan.  The secular world does not hate the New Age Contemporary Christian Church which itself always endeavors into perpetuity to harmonize pop culture America and the Word of God.  The New Age Church peddles its perverted Gospel through its secular music and are purveyors of titillation instead of feeding the Children of God with His Words and Gospel.  Satan and the world hate fundamentalists but love the New Age Contemporary Christian Church with Oprah Winfrey leading the way.    John 15:18    "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me(Jesus) first. 19If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you".    2 Timothy 4:3   For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.    Titus 2:11    For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to all men,    Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world;    Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;    Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.|`|pmna8fhyaa	Does that apply to atheists? I mean, can you call any atheist a fundie? I hope not.    To answer your question: I haven't found anything endearing so far, but then I didn't exactly look for such things.    P.S. Don't forget the Jewish fundies.    edit: for all we know, you will cease to exist when you die (like everyone else), but we don't tell you that as a threat. Ceasing to exist after death is not our punishment for your belief, the way hell is their punishment for our non-belief.|`|zbAKxm0daa	Nothing.

hR7OsqtRaa	Who created Humans.? People may say The Big Bang. Then Who Created the Big Bang.? Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

There is no evidence for God, there is no reason for anyone to disprove something you have yet to prove in the first place|`|AA11690436	What 'disapproves' God is all the bad stuff God allegedly did (or at least allowed believers to do in his name).  However, you probably mean what 'disproves' God.  Nothing much disproves a remote Deistic or Pantheistic God, but I think God as conceived of in Christianity and Islam is disproved by not doing all the things he is supposed to do, like making the world believe one way or the other, return and defeat the devil, stuff like that.  Believers have to keep pushing the time table back, and that creates a certain lack of credibility.|`|kyBz7Rlmaa	What evidences show that God does exists? none|`|aBJDqwq6aa	Absence of proof indicates proof of absence.    Here's just a few examples:    Since every 'god' imagined is claimed to have powers that do not conform to natural laws and is not bound by natural law, it can be concluded that such an entity can not affect anything in the Universe, and as such, can be dismissed outright.  The fact that 99.9% of people worship the same god as their parents. Since your religion is determined by where you were born, when you were born, and to whom you were born, it is obvious that religious belief is the result of indoctrination and not based on anything real. If you were born in ancient Greece, you would never have heard of Jesus and you would be worshiping the Greek gods.  Not one iota of empirical evidence of ANY god has ever been found.  Every 'holy book' from which the concept of a deity is derived contains impossibilities, contradictions, and scientific and historical fallacies.  No 'holy book' demonstrates any knowledge other than that which would have been available at the time of it's writing.  Though there have been thousands of god's worshiped throughout history, no group of followers has ever been observed to derive any benefit for such belief. Since religions are mutually exclusive, if one god were real, you would expect to see a discernible effect on the followers of a 'real' deity.  An omniscient, omnipotent being is logically impossible.  Every event that has been claimed to be 'divine' or supernatural can be easily explained by the natural laws of the Universe.    For more you can visit http://godisimaginary.com    Now, can you enlighten us as to what you think 'proves' god?|`|0vmQNf0oaa	None.    It is impossible for something to come into being from absolute nothing with absolutely no cause. That would violate the laws of thermodynamics.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!    It is a fact that the media will make the first person to produce even the smallest scintilla of verifiable evidence for a god a multimillionaire overnight!!    But it will never happen!!    Believe what you want but trying to prove the existence of god and criticizing people who do not believe is a total waste of time and kills the intellect!!|`|PCBQbQmraa	The origin of gods. and by god i don't mean Jesus or what ever i mean the ones that the Aztec use to worship because they used god to explain why things happen well just like anything it snow balls and evolves into other religion. and but now we look back at the Aztec and laugh at there belief in the gods because we can prove why these things happen and why they are here.

lujO90uMaa	There have been Bible believers who thought that the baby became "a living soul" by drawing its first breath. I think that this might be the case.    Under this interpretation, patristic condemnations of induced abortion as destroying a child are based on the destruction of the potential for the "mass of tissue" to become a human child.

When that clump of replicating cells becomes exponential growing mass of firing synaptic activity. When this happens the promise of human life begins. Human life begins in the womb unborn and born  It does not matter if it comes by the birth canal or C section. It comes.     The beginning of consciousness and birth are events    Then the question arises when does consciousness begin and how do we perceive it?
69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	I don't know either.  Choice means just that....choice.  No one should be dictating this decision to women in this situation.

I've seen too many cases where it was the right thing to do.|`|2b0f81fb7bceab4ca7447b2b2061c7dbaa	Because 99% of the reason to be pro-choice is to be pro-abortion.

I don't let their bias bother me, I am quite content knowing I support all choices for a woman.|`|WrVof5UAaa	its that whole "black or white" evangelical way of thinking|`|MMImKRAgaa	probably because between the two choices pro-choice has brought about the most abortians|`|ATPPWOpWaa	Remember, half of those aborted are females too.  Do you support their right to choose as well?    It has always been the human condition that mankind has sought a good name and to be of good report.  And all men according to their various abilities did seek to perfect virtue and character.   But in these last days mankind has degenerated to a point that virtue has become a byword to be scorned and laughed upon.    Selfish ambition and gratification is the new religion and modern society always strives to become the full pattern of pop culture as defined by the media.  All the while being unawares of what was lost.      The motive of abortion isn't to be found in any recognizable virtue but is born out of the lusts of the flesh and a heart waxed cold.  What does abortion have to do with compassion, empathy, fortitude, generosity, honesty, honor, hopefulness,  humility, innocence,  joy, kindness, lovingness, mercy,  patience, peacefulness, sympathy, temperance, thankfulness, trustworthiness, truth or wisdom?    But abortion proceeds from the darkness of the heart and is synonymous with apathy, carelessness, excess, envy, greed, indulgence, infidelity, ingratitude,  immorality, impatience, impurity, irresponsibility,  laziness, lust, promiscuity,  selfish ambition, self gratification and sensuality.    The reason 98% of women getting abortions has to do with the fact that a baby simply cuts into the 'action', the fun, the sex, the parties, the travel and the money.   Nowhere is the face of a beautiful baby considered or love or happiness for someone else.  The abortionists is willing to forfeit someone else's life so that they may gratify their own.|`|a62b895e23928e2555a83a605626c900aa	Pro means for .

China IS growing(though their growth is still pegged on ours) and Russia is rebounding(but still below its historical place), however, the US is still growing and when the US sneezes, the rest of the world still gets a cold meaning when we slow down EVERYONE else slows down too. In fact, when this economic crisis is over we in the West will be able to grow even larger and become more powerful as the developing world will have a vacuum we can fill. Empires stand for several centuries, we(the US) have only been a world power since the Spanish American war.

It's not something that u would use on an everyday basis to call ppl, though.  I sort of like the term b/c of it's exotic sound, the reason why i don't think it's racist is b/c i've never heard of anyone use it as a racist term, not like the n-word. Or maybe b/c in Panama(or any Latin country in South/Central America and the Caribbean)it's not considered racist? idk. I'm from Texas and i've never heard mulatto used negatively.

Evolution is a little like that.|`|E9chZY74aa	There have been zero good mutations.|`|AA11297267	You're thinking backwards -- a common error among those who don't understand evolution.  You see vision as "important for survival" -- as if we had to have had vision or we wouldn't have survived, so something must have directed us towards vision.    The reality is the other way around.  A long time ago one of our ancestors, almost certainly a much simpler creature, got a mutation that gave it some ability to sense light.  Not vision, just the ability to sense light.  It turned out to be useful, such that the creatures descended from that original got some benefit from light sensing, and so more of them survived than the ones that couldn't sense light.  No "direction towards vision," just simple statistics -- more that could sense light survived, so there were more that could sense light around to reproduce, so they produced more offspring, and eventually overwhelmed those that couldn't sense light.    And so goes each step in the evolution of vision.  Each step is a tiny change, and though there were certainly more tiny changes that weren't useful or were even harmful, only the ones that gave some kind of benefit got the statistical edge.  Over a very long period, those small steps and statistical advantages led to eyes -- eyes of all kinds, not just our human eyes.    It helps if you don't look at it backwards.    Peace.|`|pYrooh0Haa	The vast majority of mutations are either neutral or harmful. Only a small, small fraction actually help the organism survive.    But because mutations are inevitable (DNA replication has a very good "spell check" but it's not perfect), evolution can occur.    Natural selection will help increase the chances of reproduction of an organism with a beneficial mutation, which will then pass down to their offspring.    Evolution is exceedingly complex, and yet also astoundingly simple.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	Evolution isn't a tool, it's a mechanism.|`|ATsdSM7saa	I think you are moving a little too fast with evolution.

yHfsHp6naa	Because it never happened in the first place.|`|ZZ4Nh7yJaa	When I read the opening line of 'Back in the day", I thought like the 60's.  Shows my age, I guess.  There are signs all around.  You have to look for them, read  your book of Revelations.  The economy for one, world wars have already happened, and there is the never ending fight over "Holy Land", children do not honor their parents as much, violence is on going in our streets, adultery is common place, as are out of wed births, violence and drugs are claiming our youths lives, as are gangs, and cults.  Our waters are polluted, our air is smoggy and we are dumping garbage into the land.  All of these problems, are man made.  They are man made due to the free will we were given.  See what a mess some of us have made it?  Yes, the Old Book says, Moses looked into a burning bush and saw the face of God; it also says God cast down rains for forty days and nights, flooding the earth; and he destroyed an entire city for their behavior; also took the son of Pharaoh and all the first born sons of Egypt; and through the ages has allowed his 'children' to suffer, waiting for that promised day.  Later in the New Books, Christ appeared to save man kind, walked on water, healed the ill, cured the blind, and fed the droves, to be killed on a cross after unspeakable tortures.  Your question reminds me of the line of a song, "What if Jesus was one of us, riding on the bus?"  The key to the question being, would you recognize him?  As science has developed explaining all the things people had before thought was done by God: thunder, lightening, crop failure, flooding, illness, sickness, poverty, starvation, violence and 1000's of others, we tend to look for an explanation to every thing.  Your father is right, it is a book of stories to guide us through life.  There are many who would add the political, governmental and human reasons to create and maintain a bible.  Face it, in the Roman Era, while marching through city after city, leaving them in ashes and death, the Romans's expanding their enterprise, would quote, "It is the work of God."  Really?  I can't not see my loving God, riding through a city or village, robbing, killing and burning.  I would not spend my time worrying about what you might see or experience when the time comes.  Lead a life of example, one that is fair and in good conscience.  If, that time does not come, as some believe you would have still lead a life of compassion, understanding, respect and love.|`|D6yEjfciaa	they do happen,but just like back in the day it takes time for them to be known.  here is something for you to think about.  jesus left peter in charge,   peter left linus in charge,  linus started the catholic church and was the first pope.   and so on and so on, to the pope we have today.  all the other churches protest the catholic church so they are all called protestences     catholics are a world wide church, they are the biggest christian church there is.    they have a lot of rules, sometimes it makes me want to change churches to the easyer churches, but i stay catholic and try to follow the rules that the pope makes, who was left in charge.

Allah tells us He is Pure, Loving, and absolutely Just in every respect. He says He is the Best of Judges. He also tells us the life we are in here is a test. He has created everything existing and He created whatever happens as well. There is nothing in this existence except what He has created. He also says in the Quran He created evil (although He is not evil). He is using this as one of the many tests for us.    Consider people who do so much evil in the earth and then live to a ripe old age in the splendor and wealth of their ill-gotten gains and die without ever being taken to task for their deeds. Where is the justice or fairness in this? Allah provides a clear answer for us in Quran as to what is in store for these most evil of people:    A brief enjoyment in this world! - and then unto Us will be their return, then We shall make them taste the severest torment because they used to disbelieve [in Allah, belie His Messengers, deny and challenge His proofs, signs, verses, etc.]  [Noble Quran 10:70]      That Day mankind will proceed in scattered groups that they may be shown their deeds.    So whoever does good equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.    And whoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom, shall see it.  [Noble Quran 99:6-8]      Do people think that they will be left alone because they say: "We believe," and will not be tested.    And We indeed tested those who were before them. And Allah will certainly make (it) known (the truth of) those who are true, and will certainly make (it) known (the falsehood of) those who are liars, (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test).    Or those who do evil deeds think that they can outstrip Us (i.e. escape Our Punishment)? Evil is that which they judge!    Whoever hopes for the Meeting with Allah, then Allah's Term is surely coming. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.    And whosoever strives, he strives only for himself. Verily, Allah is free of all wants from the 'Alamin (mankind, jinns, and all that exists).    Those who believe [in the Oneness of Allah (Monotheism) and in Messenger Muhammad peace be upon him , and do not apostate because of the harm they receive from the polytheists], and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall reward them according to the best of that which they used to do.    And We have enjoined on man to be good and dutiful to his parents, but if they strive to make you join with Me (in worship) anything (as a partner) of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.    And for those who believe (in the Oneness of Allah and other items of Faith) and do righteous good deeds, surely, We shall make them enter in (the entrance of) the righteous (i.e. in Paradise).    Of mankind are some who say: "We believe in Allah," but if they are made to suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the trial of mankind as Allah's punishment, and if victory comes from your Lord, (the hypocrites) will say: "Verily! We were with you (helping you)." Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the breast of the 'Alamin (mankind and jinns)?    Verily, Allah knows those who believe, and verily, He knows the hypocrites [i.e. Allah will test the people with good and hard days to discriminate the good from the wicked (although Allah knows all that before putting them to test)].    [Noble Quran 29:2-11]      Reward and punishment are definitely a part of the Next Life on a very permanent basis. Those who suffer in this life and seemly have nothing to show for all their hard works, good deeds and sacrifices and maintaining the faith can look forward to a far greater reward in a place where these things will not be temporary but rather they will be for eternity. Those who corrupt, violate, injure and do evil and destruction seem to escape any justice here, yet in the Next Life they too will see the fruits of their labors, and certainly they will be paid according to what they have done as well.    As regards oppression, this is something Allah forbids for Himself to do to anyone and He hates it when anyone oppresses someone else. He does have absolute power over everything. He allows sickness, disease, death and even oppression so we can all be tested in what we do.|`|gHSarVD1aa	Without suffering there is no contentment.    That's reality.

God is love but He also gave us freewill He gave man the ability to chose Him and have peace or to reject Him and have misery.|`|480dc8a399d43c50d041ddc04f0dc319aa	IF God give us free will, then he can not interfer when we want to kill others or make them suffer. We can't have both. If he didn't allow suffering in this world, then Christ could not have died on the cross for your sins. Saving your soul is more important than saving your physical body.   It has always been about saving your soul, not this physical body.   What benefit will it be to you if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul? (Mark 8:36) God is not happy with the world and it's evil ways, but he has no choice if he is to be true to his word. He has to allow it for now, as horrid as it is.|`|E9chZY74aa	Sin brings pain and suffering.  God put laws into effect in the beginning.  We see the big laws where if I jump off a building, I cannot expect to not hurt.  But there are others.  STDs, AIDS, suffering when parents divorce, and so on.  If all were to do as God commands, then there would not be the pain.|`|t0mb150gaa	Because what you do with your life is your choice and people make bad choices in life that cause there own suffering. I am not a religious person but i think that is there is a god it would be his test to humanity to see how much we help our fellow people and has given us the right to make bad choices so we can learn from the suffering to be better people.
X548yCR6aa	Dogs are mentioned in the Quran: 7:176, 18:18, 18:22 (three times). NO WHERE does God call the dogs dirty animals or give any indication that they should be avoided or treated the way many Muslims think they should. Actually the story of the people of the cave, in Sura 18, gives the indication that they should be appreciated.    There are dog-hating hadiths, but they are unbased.|`|klYQZPi5aa	First Qur'an is not Enough   (1) The Quraan speaks of the importance of the Sunnah, for example:    (a) Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): He who obeys the Messenger has indeed obeyed Allaah . . . [al-Nisaa 4:80] Allaah described obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him) as being a part of obedience to Him. Then He made a connection between obedience to Him and obedience to the Prophet (peace be upon him): O you who believe! Obey Allaah and obey the Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59]    (b) Allaah warns us not to go against the Prophet (peace be upon him), and states that whoever disobeys him will be doomed to eternal Hell. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning): . . . And let those who oppose the Messengers commandment beware, lest some fitnah (trial, affliction, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them. [al-Nur 24:63]    (c) Allaah has made obedience to His Prophet a religious duty; resisting or opposing it is a sign of hypocrisy: But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you [Muhammad] judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission. [al-Nisaa 4:65]    (d) Allaah commands His slaves to respond to Him and His Messenger: O you who believe! Answer Allaah (by obeying Him) and (His) Messenger when he calls you to that which will give you life . . . [al-Anfaal 8:24]    (e) Allaah also commands His slaves to refer all disputes to him: . . . (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allaah and His Messenger . . . [al-Nisaa 4:59]    (2) The Sunnah itself indicates the importance of the Sunnah. For example:    (a) Al-Tirmidhi reported from Abu Raafi and others that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I do not want to see any one of you reclining on his couch and, when he hears of my instructions or prohibitions, saying I dont accept it; we didnt find any such thing in the Book of Allaah. Abu Eesaa said: This is a saheeh hasan hadeeth. (See Sunan al-Tirmidhi, Shaakir edition, no. 2663).    Al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Would any of you think, reclining on his couch, that Allaah would only describe what is forbidden in the Quraan? I tell you, by Allaah, that I have warned and commanded and prohibited things that are as important as what is in the Quraan, if not more so. (Reported by Abu Dawud, Kitaab al-Khiraj wal-imaarah wal-fay).    (b) Abu Dawud also reported from al-Irbaad ibn Saariyah, may Allaah be pleased with him, that the Messenger of Allaah (peace be upon him) led us in prayer one day, then he turned to us and exhorted us strongly . . . (he said), Pay attention to my sunnah (way) and the way of the Rightly-guided Khaleefahs after me, adhere to it and hold fast to it. (Saheeh Abi Dawud, Kitaab al-Sunnah).    second concerning  Dogs   It is permissible to keep a dog as a guard dog, so long as you avoid letting it inside the house and are careful to avoid letting it make vessels and clothes naajis (impure), because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: Whoever keeps a dog, his reward for good deeds will decrease by one qeeraat every day, except dogs used for farming or herding livestock. Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 2322.     The version narrated by Muslim (1574) says: Whoever keeps a dog, except a dog for hunting or herding livestock, his reward will be decreased by two qeeraats every day.|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Well, Muslims would tend to bugger them, so dogs are haram, as in Dogs harami, no salami!|`|E9chZY74aa	Not Biblical.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	?????????????? WTF ????????????????????|`|047IPSovaa	Muhammad said so in the curan - that's good enough for me.  He didn't cotton to eating them either so don't try that.|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Pet dogs are not harmful. I have two of the sweetest puppies in the entire world. Dogs are domesticated, which means they are very tame. But it all depends on how there are trained. Since pitbulls, for examples, can lock their jaw and have a very tough and mean figure, people treat them terrible and they end up mean. But I have met some extremely sweet pitbulls who would never hurt a fly. It all depends if you are nice or mean to them. If you take care of a dog and give it plenty of love and attention, he will grow up sweet and gentle. But if you mistreat a dog and abuse it, he will grow up mean.|`|60df5ff8f8ccc7873e68c2407a7ca9f6aa	The animal that is kept should not be a dog, because Islam has forbidden keeping dogs except guard dogs and hunting dogs. This has been explained in the answer to question no. 69777. The Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: The angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog. Narrated by al-Bukhaari (3225) and Muslim (2106). Would the Muslim be happy for the angels of mercy not to accompany him in his house because of an animal he is keeping?|`|jLDgei7faa	i dont know, but i heard cats aren't haram.  im just thinking, whats the difference?|`|aGynBPbCaa	haram being sacred.    i don't think there is any proof that the dog is sacred as a pet.|`|8n2NO6UVaa	Hadhrat Abu Talha (Radhiyallaahu nhu) reports that Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) said, "Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or an animate picture. (Sahih Bukhari Hadith no. 2986)    Hadhrat Ibn Abbas (Radhiyallaahu nhuma) reports from Hadhrat Maimoona (Radhiyallaahu nha) that once Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) became sad; and said that Jibra'eel (layhis Salaam) promised to meet him at night but did not turn up. "By Allah what has kept him back," said the Prophet (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam). Then he realised a puppy was under his bed. He ordered that the puppy be removed and the area be sprinkled with water. In the afternoon when Jibra'eel (layhi Salaam) came, Rasulullah (Sallallaaahu layhi Wasallam) enquired as to the delay. Jibra'eel (layhi Salaam) said that we, the group of Angels do not enter a house wherein there is a dog or pictures. (Sahih Muslim Hadith no.3928)    In the light of these Ahaadith and other narrations it is not permissible to keep dogs as pets. The household is deprived of the Mercy of Allah Ta?la.    However, Jurists have stated that it is permissible to keep a dog for security purposes, farming and hunting.    The saliva of a dog is Najis (impure). if it touches the clothes or body, that portion also becomes impure and must be washed.
gGmMw2vDaa	Yes. I have read statistics that fewer and fewer heterosexual males are volunteering to be celibate their entire lives, and so the catholic church has to take on an increasing number of homosexuals who are trying to hide from themselves.|`|yHfsHp6naa	No, but celibacy breeds sexual perversion.|`|XLfz1FQ3aa	That's analogous to asking if most people with the initials TC are gay.    OK..how many sex scandals with teenage boys have TC's been involved with?  How many TC's have observable gay behavioral characteristics?  How many TC's have behavior consistent with the behavior of closeted gay men?    You haven't provided ANY figures for any of your "observations", no anecdotes, just your statement.    Nor do you define what "observable gay behavioral characteristics" are.    Happy with my reasoning now?|`|QDFj9JPfaa	...No, just HORNY !|`|ZAkfVKgnaa	Who cares?|`|AA12194228	No, they are not. Most priests are very devout and grateful to be in the work of Christ.   A very small number of people doing wrong always makes more news than the much larger numbers of those doing right.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	no|`|JXLiZEb2aa	Most, no. Some, yes. I'm guessing that the percentage is close to 10% just like it is in almost every population.|`|AA12295528	actually, there's nothing wrong with being gay  many catholic priests have observable gay behavioral characteristics --> like what?  you should get a degree in psychology first before you talk|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	No.    Thanks for the points..|`|yH6JPjwOaa	No
P9LCC9cwaa	That is a great question! I think people are so willing simply because it IS what is taught in public school. If public schools would teach the book of god, many more people would believe. It's sad isn't it?|`|AA12181796	Um - I *don't* believe in half the commandments (all the ones which involve God telling us to cater to his ego or else) and disagree that a non-existent deity gave us his son "to die for our sins", or that anyone would be required to die in order to right anything bad I might happen to have done.     Why don't you accept that the Mahabharata is accurate?|`|X8LNbaKQaa	"Why is such a tough pill for people to swallow that the oldest living history book The Bible is accurate"    Because it isn't accurate or even self consistent.  It is simply wrong about so many things and contradicts itself in so many ways.  See:  http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/j...    The Bible is fiction, some rough historical accounts of a particular tribe and fantasy, poorly written, edited and re-edited by many men over many years, for their own political purposes.    --   Regards,    John Popelish|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	you mean "The Epic of Gilgamesh", not the bible...    i don't know why it isn't studied more.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	It is apparently a tough pill to swallow for you to understand that this is a secular nation.|`|AA11297267	Because of people like you that make completely false claims that the bible is the "oldest living history book."  You might want to go study some history, sparky...it's not even close.    Then there's the simple fact that there's multiple sources, actual artifacts (like lots of papers actually written by Mr. Washington -- no original bible sources are around), verifiable facts, etc. that clearly demonstrate the validity of other historical sources.  We have none of that for the bible.    By the way, I don't "believe" in George Washington -- I accept the fact of his existence based on the evidence.  Belief isn't involved.    Peace.|`|2CBxqNcaaa	If they don't believe the facts they will try to discredit the book|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	To say our Bible is tweaked is to call them false and that is dangerous claim with out one shred of evidence.  The Bible is more than a History Book and it is accurate and that is why people find fault with it.  If you believe all the History in the Bible you have to accept the rest is true too.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Because the bible claims to be a divine revelation- no other history book makes supernatural claims so you're comparing apples and oranges.|`|94zGdzm3aa	Yeah, the Dead Sea Scrolls have been scientifically proven to be the oldest "preachings" around...|`|X548yCR6aa	What's the Bible has to do with it? Did you mean the Vedas?  Or the Egyptian Book of Going Forth by Day, perhaps.    Why do we see mentions of George Washington is lots of contemporary historical texts, but no mentions of Jesus by historians of his time?|`|aGynBPbCaa	because it isn't history, it is religious doctrine.  There are no real dates, just unrealistic stories.  Stop trying to teach my children lies.  Maybe you should go make more money to send your kids to a private school where they can be taught religious dribble as the cold hard truth.
aucsqB7Laa	Well for now just be glad you have a chance to ogle. Try to get closer socially with her for a while then get physical. A few more accidental bumps. Try starting up a conversation about homosexuality, to test the waters. If it's all clear, casually suggest having your bunks switched for one night. Then you can crawl up there and say you missed your bunk, scootch over!!! (Or maybe, just maybe, you won't want to tell her to)  Best of luck. Just don't go head over heels for a strait person, there is plenty of fish in our polluted sea.|`|EVpsVgokaa	Make a little quiz on say like have you ever kissed a guy and like would ou ever kiss a girl.....and if you want to tound her down part (put that on the quiz) and when shes asleep touch every wear her thats what i would do....  And even you should sayu like you feal conftable when you are naked when you sleep and tell her she likes it when people do it with you!|`|gLVbSrx6aa	I actually know a girl from Somalia (Arab/Muslim country in Africa) who is a lesbian. so in your case, her ethnicity would have more to do with whether she would act on sexual feelings she has, not whether or not she has them.     I think you should try to build a closer bond with her, as friends. See how she acts and see if she sends you any signals.|`|vDG0iA8laa	How did you get "into" her...???   This is another prime example of a misuse  of a word...  Also I noticed you used ther word HOT to descrive her...   Was she exercising, out in the sun, or working over a got flame / stove..  Nowhere will you find the word HOT in the dictionary in reference physical attraxtion..  And this is in college..? My oh my..!!!!  Rachelle in High Heels
Cw58gemFaa	Yes..its in your genetic code with your dominant DNA chromosomal strands.|`|AA10232076	Yeah I guess, I mean that would explain why a person may have greenish blueish eyes, and brownish reddish hair, and why a person can have a range of skin colors just from two parents who are the same general color. But mostly the dominant genes and all that show up more. Because if my skin was a mix of my parents, I'd be a different shade of brown than what I am, so it's kinda a recessive thing too. So yeah, they're pretty much the same.|`|k7jGZydJaa	Not exactly..    With eye colors and hair colors, you get the same color as either your mom/dad/grandparents/ (whichever allele is dominant).    With skin color, you usually get a mix of the colors your mom/dad/grandparents/etc. had.      But, yes, it's all genetics. You have no control over what skin, hair, or eyes you're born with.

JY0Ix1rPaa	Yes I've been in a situation like that. I fell for one of my friends and I took a chance on our relationship I told her that I liked her. At first she didn't respond at all and it made things really awkward, but eventually came around and admitted that she had feelings for me and we're actually dating now and its amazing.     So You should definitely tell her, whats the point in wondering what could have been you know.     Good Luck|`|aucsqB7Laa	GOD YES.   It's very painfull|`|h5e62x6Kaa	I like a straight girl, possibly falling in love. But somehow, I feel like I'm nonexistent through her eyes...|`|dOM1tpX0aa	honestly, no. Shes a friend. Me and my friends act like were in love, but we all no were not. no trying to be mean, but i wouldnt ruin it.        if youh no how to lie please come answer my question.|`|wSeOxs7Jaa	I think everyone falls for a straight girl at some point. Stay away from that - you'll just get your heart broken.|`|6k3mwKthaa	I had a similar experience some years ago now. We met at work and immediately had something special brewing. Apparently she guessed more or less straightaway that I was a lezzie.  Funny, as every one else finds it hard to believe that I am a member of this select group of our society. LOL! Anyway we got very close and there was a lot of kissing and cuddling, which she found so exiting. Eventually she found mr Right, but we still exchange the odd kiss as we are the best of mates.  By all means tell her what you think of her, there is no point in hiding your feelings for somebody, even if you run the risk that she may drop you as a friend (which would be highly unlikely).|`|u04pBBq3aa	I know what you mean the other day she came up so close to me i didn't want to breathe but I don't want to tell her I like or I am gay because I am afraid it would ruin our friendship so I don't even know what to do either. I know how you feel.|`|QOKdjUY6aa	heya i know how you feel but is this freindship a really great one if so dont ruin it but just see how she acts around you and flirt with her, maybe have a few drinks and when she acts like she likes you just tease her and say your acting gay lol and see her reaction if she looks kinda serious maybe just kiss her, maybe she was tying to ask you in such an indirect way and saying she'd accept it if you were lol.... but dont tell her directly, a bit of drink will help and you two wont be as shy and plus people speak the truth more when they are drinking...... anyway good luck...|`|qOUNCq8qaa	Yeah, I've got the exact same situation except with my roommate, so its weird.|`|AA12355197	run for cover and it may be all fun and games but someone ends up getting hurt.    i say find someone who wants the same things you want or you two are on the same level at least.|`|AknbZ22laa	Yes and it sucks and hurts so bad. I worked with a girl and we talked all the time. She had a boyfriend and knew i was bi and she even flirted with me. I told her i liked her and she was ok with it and still flirted with me. But she said she was straight and loved her boyfriend to much. It does suck to like the same sex because it is so hard to find somebody  especially if you want a long term relationship. But you cant help who you like. Buy yes i have felt the same way. Sometimes it is even hard to get over the person if your feelings are so strong.  Hope it helped!
FBrwlhPtaa	Yes, that's part of our testimony of what Jesus has done in our lives. We were all sinners who have found the grace of Jesus. People who never knew me in my earlier years are shocked of what kind of life I left. My testimony is proof of the transformation that took place in my life. We don't have to tell others of our past sins. But, if it helps others to know what God can do, so be it!|`|aV3bFchtaa	Nope.  He got it wrong. That is between him and GOD.  It is such a pity that some enthusiastic evangelist left this poor chap in confusion and delusion. He is accomplishing more harm than he can imagine.|`|YAiKlPkMaa	No, especially when you aren't born again.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	No, you only need confess to God.|`|HG5Smxkjaa	No this isn't necessary...People only need to confess their sins to God....However perhaps your friend was just overwhelmed with how he has changed his ways once he found God....|`|AA11008046	Born again Christians have no responsibility to confess anything except to god through His Son Jesus christ.  Any man who sins has "..an advocate with the Father through Jesus Christ our Lord.." says the Scriptures.  No such thing in real christian of having to tell mama or your friends.  I am aware of one lady acquaintance who had taked a salt and pepper set from a restaurant because she liked the design (not necessarily to steal) but after having repented and turned her life around she too the salt and pepper set back to the restauant and apologized for taking them.  the owner almost fell over dead!  he didn't even miss them.  He was quite impressed with the ladies honesty after salvation.  So it is possible that some people take upon themselves to confess things to others but it is not part of the "born again" life.|`|1s6mQJqOaa	NO, for me my hurts are between me and Jesus and when I am born again in my mind He wiped my sins away and they no longer exist!|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Please capitalize God's name. And it's not so bad if he is excited. He just wants to share his feelings with you? Is that so wrong? Don't freak out. Geez you sound so mean. Like you don't even care about what your friend has to say. You probably don't. That's rude.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	It sounds like he is so freed from all that stuff that he wants to share it with you---maybe so you'll want to do the same or because he's so in awe of feeling good. Give him a break. This is a good thing.|`|LLey4VRzaa	I'll put it like this...They all do this, it happens when you realize that you have done some bad things...it doesn't effect you because you still have not received the Truth. Once a person does it begins the fight in them to stop doing the things your flesh loves, so they talk about their past Loves a lot. Most of them go back to doing what they are confessing to you...just sit and let them speak, it will pass. You just are not ready to give up sin or you do not know that you sin yet!|`|LuN1unJ3aa	I don't know about normal, but I would have told him to get off his high horse and be real!    What is more irritating is when a person "discovers" Jesus, confesses that he is a sinner, and then proceeds to lie, steal, and be promiscuous. Now _that_ is really irritating.    And that seems to be normal.    I think I'd ask what the guy was planning to do with his life now that he had become "born again"?|`|JxUFDutxaa	That's not a normal thing for born again Christians to do.    We only need to confess our sins to God.    Your 'acquaintance' must have had some "issues" he was dealing with.|`|5d1b54e3efed93f0e4984edefdd98aa7aa	cornered??? Ya its normal, under the circumstances|`|OT4SrmDXaa	It says confess your sins to one another. James 5:16 That means when you can find a genuine Christian to confide in. It doesn't mean blab it to everyone that says there a christians or to just anyone. It means someone you know you can trust.     A man raped a woman once. He came up and told me this because he knew I would not judge him for what he did. I did not like what he did in fact I hated it, but he didn't know Jesus. He was feeling guilt remorse for what he did and he was also very afraid because he was going to jail.       Are you a Christian? If you are not maybe he thought your suppose to tell everyone or something. He could have been misunderstanding scripture. If you are a Christian its probably because he thought he could tell you. Remember the Bible says be all things to all men. Meaning whatever they need try to be there for it.      If you can refer the man to me cause I would like to ask him why he did that? He was probably misunderstanding scripture.       He should have got to know who you were before saying all these things to you. I know that would make anyone feel uncomfortable but to me its so what.      So it sounds like he is misunderstanding scripture.|`|e4hPmzw5aa	hahah i think so|`|18475fc6aa26ed758d489d783d71e9d4aa	I've encountered this many times.  No, it is not in the "manual" but for some reason, there are those who just can't help themselves.  I suppose they feel a bit of liberation and wish to share the experience but to be perfectly honest, this does nothing for the cause.    Brightest Blessings|`|c3zUqmdXaa	John said: "If we confess him our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us". But, if you get the context, you'll see that the "he" is God. So, our sins must be confessed to God. There's nothing written ordering us to confess sins someone, but to God.|`|RyYWzEZcaa	I suspect that this person is just excited to share with you the new faith in their life and the best way they thought to do that was to show you how dramatic of a change it was.   Probably not the best way to show someone your faith.  Normal?  Eh, who knows. I don't personally think you need to confess anything except to God and the person you did something against, really its no one else's business.  Ignore all the things you wish you never heard and think instead on the message behind it.|`|yH6JPjwOaa	No that is not normal.  We are to ask for forgiveness to those we have offended and confess our sins to God only.|`|ca4d1a722e751ae09dcec4cce410f2dfaa	There is nothing in the Bible that requires one to go around saying every evil thing that one has ever done.  But many Christians do this to show evidence of a changed life.  They want others to experience the same change.  We are commanded to preach the gospel, which is nothing without speaking about sin (Christ death on the cross doesn't mean anything if there is no sin).  We talk about sin in specific terms--as an abstract concept it is meaningless.  It would be sort of hypocritical to do this without admitting your own sins.|`|AA10014750	To me it sounds like James 5:16 presently.|`|gkffZHF2aa	That's called a "testimony", and yeah, there are some who feel that they need to tell everybody about it.  Gotta cut this dude some slack, he's probably a very new believer and is a little over-the-top right now.  He'll still be sharing his testimony because that's part of sharing the Gospel, but he'll also learn a little discernment about knowing what to share and how much.  What he gave you was the full-on thing, much like what he'd stand up and testify to in church, where he'd get "amen" and "praise God".  Look at it this way: As uncomfortable as it was for you to hear, in listening to him anyway you did him a kindness.  So props to you for being a nice guy.  Oops, gal.  Just saw the cap on the avatar at first.|`|D6yEjfciaa	no but the thing is if he was born again then that means he was a baby christian and just like babies he was just learning how to express his faith, its a good thing thatyou didn't squash him right there , because there is no victory in squashing a baby.

The Jewish believe he was here, but not the savior.  I believe he was a real person, like Moses, Samuel, Jacob, John the Baptist, Arron, Lot, Daniel.  Some religions, like Muslim, believe in Christ, but not in Christianity.  Rather they see Christan's as a plague on humanity.  Buddhists believe in Christ, and that he was a spreader or good will, and humanity.  I am from a family that have Baptists, Christan's, Muslims, Catholic, Jewish and a couple dabble in cults.  But, we all have a healthy respect for each others faith, and through that respect for individualism, we maintain a happy, healthy family.  To us, it is not as much who or what you believe in, but what you do with it.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	In my humble opinion, you Sir have found what Jesus Christ taught and follow Him completely.

By believing in Jesus and being saved the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your unsaved family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! Thats HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of I told you so from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story right out of Gods Holy Word, the Bible!    Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). Then he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME. (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling) But Abraham said, Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you if you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED! Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for worshiping this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever and ever!!!    The Bible God promised the Jews to be rich lenders not borrowers like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DONT OBEY they will be poor slaves and borrowers like Lazarus in Heaven! This story is more proof that nothing in the Bible makes any sense or can be taken seriously! Thats why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible is factual! Especially the silly teasing words that the Bible writers dreamed up Sweet Jesus aka Creator of the Universe will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Christians hate homosexuals, atheists, abortionists, and what have you. Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that or wouldnt they? Thats about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!    Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over thembring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a slaughter house religion and the preachers know!)    Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name."     On a second thought I give you my personal view on Heaven and Hell that some of the most honest Bible writers share with me. There is no Heaven and Hell. The whole idea is a religious people control device and a money making scheme banking on human religious gullibility! The Bible writers had God certify King Solomon to be the WISEST MAN ever to set foot on this Earth, and he has this to say...     Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is Gods word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.    Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.    The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind     Job 7:9 (NIV) As a|`|2FTaKXz3aa	That is to diverse a question.

It's the method of control used by religion to scare the **** out of people to keep believing in their false deities and living by the rules of an ancient book that has no solid proof of anything whatsoever.
B0GujA9Aaa	This is a tricky question.     Yes the Pope could have done more to save Jewish and Romany lives but they figured that if it didn't directly affect them then they didn't have to worry about it.     Some Catholics stood hand in hand with the Nazis because they thought that Jews were christ killers and they also believed that getting rid of the so called "undesirable elements" in society was a positive thing.

It's easy to sit safe at home and say that someone else should have been willing to sacrifice the people he was sworn to guide and protect in an attempt to prevent a crime, but how many of your own family, friends, and neighbors would you, personally, have been willing to see hauled off to the ovens for your act of protest?|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Which is better -- an outspoken pope and more dead Jews, or a quiet pope and fewer dead Jews?

We have all heard the expression hind sight is 20/20 and i see a lot of that with pope pius and being no one on this board i'm pretty certain have no idea of how well the Nazis were at deception and look at how long it took America to realize what was actually going on and our Hero of the era Charles Lindbergh was totally against us going to war even after Japan hit pearl Harbor. I've read some of the most ridiculous things i've read against Catholics on this R&S site are beyond reasoning and i'm beginning to see that with Pope Pius.We americans were insulated from Europes problems then and how many of us were in a position to have done any thing with out endangering lives.

Plus, if you die faithful to God and what's right, instead of caving in to a psychotic dictator, wouldn't you go to heaven? Why are Catholics afraid of death if heaven is what awaits them?

Every sign of unjust discrimination in their regard should be avoided. These persons are called to fulfil God's will in their lives and, if they are Christians, to unite to the sacrifice of the Lord's Cross the difficulties they may encounter from their condition."        "2333 Everyone, man and woman, should acknowledge and accept his sexual identity. Physical, moral and spiritual difference and complementarity are orientated toward the goods of marriage and the flourishing of family life."        2211 The political community has a duty to honour the family, to assist it, and to ensure especially:    * the freedom to establish a family, have children and bring them up in keeping with the family's own moral and religious convictions;  * the protection of the stability of the marriage bond and the institution of the family;  * the freedom to profess one's faith, to hand it on and raise one's children in it, with the necessary means and institutions..."

D9lMg7A2aa	Only ONE makes it in the sense that its detractors will not take the claim on themself. And that is the Catholic Church. A Baptist, Methodist, Christian Scientist,  Evangelical -- whatever ! -- will say that the Catholic Church is wrong in this or that doctrine or moral teaching but will NOT say and WE are right. That is, A Methodist won't say to fellow Baptists and Lutherans etc. "WE have the true teaching on Faith and Morals".

If there's only "One True God" it follows that there is only one true way to worship Him, and from that that all other religions are evil and should be exterminated with the followers converted "for their own good".  The first monotheist monarch, Pharaoh Ikhnaton of Egypt, was also the also first to practice the religious oppression and forced conversion now seen world wide among the Abrahamic faiths.  Polytheistic religions had no such religious wars-granted they still had wars, just not over religion-since they respected each others Gods, even allowing a conquered people to set up temples and continue to worship as they always had unless the new rulers had a problem with some aspect of it, such as human sacrifice.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	All of them.|`|AXoAMEY5aa	All of them.
ygimTNzoaa	Hard question. Jocks are not long term, goths are usually in touch with reality and the world surrounding them.. And goths have more common sense. Jocks are usually just book smart and focused on accomplishing their dreams and goals, not so much about other peoples. So, I think goth would be more for me. Plus I'm more into goth music, I don't like rap hip hop or R&B and that's usually what jocks flock to. Jocks are a good time and short term unrealistic relationship.|`|AA10232076	I'd pick a Jock over a Goth just because the jock and I can talk about sports and it'd be mildly enjoyable.|`|MyV9qm99aa	The term Jock is derived from Jock Strap.

You need to find Christ today!  If you really care about what happens to you when you die, read this and repent, and ask Jesus to come into your heart and life for all eternity and he will.    As it is written, there is none righteous, not even one.  Romans 3:10    For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Romans 6:23    For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believes in him will not perish but have eternal life. John 3:16.    Behold, I stand at the door and knock, if any one hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him and sup with him and he with me. Revelation 3:20    As many as received him, to them he gave the power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name. John 1:12    Repent therefore, and be converted that your sins may be blotted out and that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord. Acts 3:19    that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord, and believe in your heart that   God raised him from the dead, you shall be saved.  Rom. 10:9    If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. Old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. II Corinthians 5:17|`|pYrooh0Haa	If you have kids then a part of you will still be alive after your death.    But think of the upside, at least you got to experience life in the first place.

I sometimes run with this line of thinking, and one of two things happens.  The first is I get an attack of the existential heebie jeebies and panic about suddenly finding myself dead only not knowing that I'm dead because when you're dead you  don't    know      you're    not     there     The second is more interesting, irrational and inexplicable; but it goes to the heart of who I am as a religious person.  Which is to deny that the the story you tell can possibly be the whole of it.  Can it simply be for nothing that we are not only alive but conscious of it?  Did the universe "go to all this trouble" to make us, if at the end we are forgotten and no-one ever knows we've been here?    Yeah yeah, I know we're just specks of dust on a speck of cosmic dust, our lives are but a breath etc etc.  Been there got the t shirt.  But I cannot live as though that is the whole truth; I don't think anyone can.  We live as though our lives mean something; perhaps that's because they do.  And that's where my faith that a certain kind of tentative mystical theism is needed to complete the story; within which nothing is final, and nothing lost that needs to be saved.|`|J7KSKm54aa	That is sad|`|Iva8drdfaa	Sounds peaceful.

Once you give yourself to God you have a home in heaven which is the best place anyone could be. All you have to do is pray a prayer like this:  Lord Jesus, please save me for I cant save myself. I know that I am a sinner and that you died on the cross for my sins. Please cleanse me from all of my sins and make me whole. I give you my life and will live for you forever. Amen|`|yNvA3Wreaa	Have you been reading Ecclesiastes (9:2-6)?      "It is the same for all.  There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and for the unclean; for the man who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good man is, so is the sinner; as the swearer is, so is the one who is afraid to swear.     "This is an evil in all that is done under the sun, that there is one fate for all men.  Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of men are full of evil and insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterwards they go to the dead.    "For whoever is joined with all the living, there is hope; surely a live dog is better than a dead lion.  For the living know they will die; but the dead do not know anything, nor have they any longer a reward, for their memory is forgotten.  Indeed their love, their hate and their zeal have already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun."    The thought of my death does not trouble me (possibly because it's not obviously imminent) but the idea of the end of our species and universe is kind of sad.  But there is no reason to think there are not other universes.|`|0MiCHlp5aa	I like your question, and I feel like this a lot.    First, let me second what you said in "Additional Details." I too often feel that life is meaningless, even with the knowledge that God exists. In fact, I sometimes feel that God's existence would make life more meaningless (please don't attack me Christians, I'm not intentionally attacking you, just working through my thoughts); for instance, if God created us, why? Is he just up there watching us kill each other and let other people starve to death and be all-around miserable? Are we his entertainment. Are we his class project? Are we the musings of a very bored and lonely all-knowing deity? What's the point of that? Why do I exist if my sole purpose is to bring some sort of relief or pleasure to a creature who has everything? Why am I forced to be stuck here like that? That's how I feel about life with a god. I wonder if you feel a similar way.    When I get to thinking about this (which, I must admit, is often), I just tell myself to accept the fact that there either is no point whatsoever--we all die and disappear and everything ceases to exist in our little mind, which is, of course, our entire world from start to finish--or there is some grand point that I will never ever be able to grasp or even contemplate. Either way, what you've got to do is find meaning to your life today that will preoccupy you. If you can't find meaning to life in general or existence in general, focus on your own life. Remember, we're all in this together--all of humanity is here, wondering these same things. What I like to think about is how much help I can be to those who suffer. If this life is the one chance we get at existence, then I should do everything in my power to make sure that everyone gets to enjoy what they've been given. Go volunteer at a soup kitchen or help the homeless or volunteer with kids. It all sounds corny, I know--trust me, I'm actually rather pessimistic and skeptical--but it's the only thing that I've ever been able to think of that helps.     If you ever get down about this just tell yourself how much good you can do in the life of another. One day, sure, you both may be dead and gone forever--no thoughts, no memories, nothing--but for this brief cosmic millisecond when you were both alive, you helped that person take advantage of the little time he or she had in this sad, meaningless existence--you made that time a little easier for someone else.    Hope this helps. :)|`|t3W4h59haa	Yeah.

AA11440601	It does not.    Saint Mary Magdalene was the first witness to the resurrection of Jesus. (See the 20th Chapter of the Gospel of John).     She was one of Jesus' followers during his ministry, and was present at the cross when he died.     There is some debate on whether she is the woman in Luke 7 who was a notorious sinner. Most biblical scholars believe that Mary Magdalene was not the notorious sinner.    The 8th chapter of the Gospel of Luke describes Mary Magdalene as being healed and supporting Jesus' ministry out of her means.    With love in Christ.

What I do know being a nurse is that fertility treatments are very very expensive.  Even with my income I couldn't afford it, so saying that there must be financial means somewhere.  Seriosly, those on welfare can't afford fertility treatments or a nanny which is what this lady has!|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I don't know about HER being crazy, but the doctors that administered her treatments must have lost their minds. That medical team should be the ones that have to support that woman and all 14 of her kids.|`|AA10451488	I feel really sorry for the kids. It's not their fault that their Mom is insane and aided by a completely unethical doctor in her insanity.     You will end up hearing alot about these poor kids, especially when child protective services are investigating neglect accusations.     You know that she is going to apply for all sorts of welfare. I say that the doctor should be required to reimburse the tax payers who are having to pay.
Ynsow6qbaa	Night of, many nights after.|`|nHizaTiDaa	All I can tell you is to go buy that Kim Cattral book about sex!    And have a lot of fun "studying" it together and doing lots of homework after your marriage.    That book is wonderful. I bought it for a few of my kids when they got married and slipped it into the presents for the girls during their bachelorette parties.      And why not try sex the first night? It's not impossible.  Just don't expect "fireworks" at first.  But they do happen... just "do your homework" and love and trust one another.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	Congratulations on your decision to do it God's way.

AMa9czcBaa	I think she is right-I would not sleep with a stranger either.    Let's face it you two have never met-on an emotional/spiritual level you have connected but physically you are two total strangers, you don't know what she feels like you don't know what she smells like.    You should respect the fact that she doesn't want to rush things and love her even more for that.|`|PuWucUs3aa	hey you're not in love!! you're just horny!|`|1o0skmFEaa	hi!! you should listen to 1st capital vice....     :D that's a pretty good advice!! i think she's totally right actually... and the thing about backing off... is just to give her time to think like stoping the sexual talk for awhile...    byee luv yaaa!! write me!! :D|`|0c9cGh8Oaa	How can you love someone you dont even know? Any way if you really think you love her and you know that she loves you back then just give her some time and share the speacial moments you have together, When the time is right for her she will let you know.....|`|AknbZ22laa	How do you know you love her when you havent met her? But anyways it seems like she is scared. I would just ask her why she wouldnt want to do anything but also respect her decision. Also dont get to attached. It hurts to like someone and want to do stuff but they dont want to. Good luck

Lrb8uVh9aa	As long as it's obvious that some thought has gone into it, then she should like it. Personalised cards are nice- you can make them online through sites like Kodak, with photos of the two of you on the front. Flowers are a good idea- if she's mentioned her favourite type of flower then go for that, or if not, roses are always nice. You could also make a CD of her favourite songs, or fill a photo album with pictures of you together.   If you want to spend more money, jewellery is a good idea (unless you know her taste, go for a simple silver necklace or earrings). Or you could book a weekend break if you can afford it. Surprise her with dinner at a nice restaurant, or take her for a picnic (champagne, chocolates etc).|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Necklace, diamonds, pearls, puppies, chocolate, roses, white carnation, engagement ring, promise ring,.

Maybe for some extra $$ they would go and get the toy to attach. Otherwise, there is enough time. Maybe you could ship what you want delivered to that floral shop before hand.

You would not appreciate it if someone laughed at you for being interested in the game, or for believing in democracy, or anything you believe in.    Laughing at his deep beliefs is belittling him, telling him his world view is laughable and crazy.  It is not kind, not mature, not tolerant.  He is not harming you and you should let him say a prayer.|`|X5v4TjZQaa	yes|`|d4slGQG5aa	It's not exactly nice to laugh, it is disrespecting his religion.|`|CoBFyszeaa	YES U R LAGHING AT HIS FAITH N 2 HIM IT MAY LOOK LYK UR LARFIN @ MORE THAN JUS THAT....STOP OR HE MAY STRT 2 ASSUME UR RACIST|`|fvN18yvGaa	You never know how anyone is going to react when u laff at their religon...its best to go through life trying not 2 piss ppl off...see ull understand that after uve gotten older and  see and hear of ppl dieing for what seems like nothing...|`|IuW1t40xaa	if he was a pro footballer he'd get a yellow card for taking his jumper off|`|BJFeIjvpaa	his happy, and what?    i mean as long as your not laughing out of spite, or taking the piss out of him,thats just wrong.

pLPKo6mBaa	I think it's just because of how far the "joke" or whatever went. I mean, stuff like that happens right here on Yahoo!Answers all of the time. Look at Books&Authors - you'll see the war between Twilight fans and anti-Twilighters. Look at Celebrities - there's the Jonas Brothers fangirls and the anti-Jonas Brothers.    Once something gets immensely popular, you'll see and hear of it EVERYWHERE. And if you happen to dislike it, then it's bound to annoy you. Some people take it further by proclaiming their undying loathing for it, and feel the need to keep the thing going on and on by letting everyone else know how much they hate it.    Personally, I don't really care. I thought the Boxxy videos were funny, that girl looks like she's on crack or something. But as seen from the answers above me, I'm sure she annoys the crap out of some people. It's only when a person starts going "OHHH I LOVE BOXXY SHE'S THE QUEEN OF THE INTERNET" or "I HATE that stupid whore Boxxy, she's an idiot and a pathetic excuse for a human being!!" is when it gets to be ridiculous.    Also I think it's technically spelled Bawksy.    Here's some more info:  http://encyclopediadramatica.com/Boxxy|`|LVe6MJfMaa	Probably because she sounds kinda annoying and she's fake. but why do you care that people hate her? if you like her..thats great, but others won't. i personally don't hate her, but others may hate her because she's a poser.|`|94zGdzm3aa	WOW...that was the most annoying thing I've seen in awhile...    So let me get this straight, she's NOT on drugs nor is she A.D.D. - so she's really that stupid?! She pushes the "Look at me I'm so cute" act a bit far for my taste...|`|hkvWDU3xaa	OMG that girl is so stupid. I guess maybe people are hating on her because she appears to be some pathetic person looking for attention?    Added Detail : LMAO wow, and by the looks of , vicky, with as much time as you have invested into that whole ordeal that you know everything there is to know about it, you must be as lame as she is. Really, though, you need to stop admiring her and go get a life of your own.|`|Cclr5Z3paa	Personally, I find her amusing.    The arguments over it piss me off more than naythign about the actual videos.|`|KgCUpE5naa	Personally, I love her. She represents everything that [ebaumsworld] hates. She's cute, spunky, and childish, and she knows she's just having fun. That contradicts with their big internet-tough guy attitudes. Other people say they don't like her because she's fake, but that's just part of her joke. But as we all know, the intern3tz are seri0us buiznesz. =D    Also, buttsecks.
oil8ALh4aa	Im not into religion, but I am very spiritual. I believe that there is definitely someone watching over us. So I would pray, I didn't know who i was praying to but i'd still pray. Change always helps too. Like changing the way you think, your daily routine, your job, your career, where you live, anything. Knowledge, going out and discovering, weather to another country or a new part of town or your own neighborhood. Helping others, sharing your heart, traveling, or learning about something you never know about. Go do something you've always wanted to do. Even if you turn to Jesus, you gotta keep him there cause people do fade away from God over time. Only you can save your self. Only you can make the choice.|`|nkUPPmTCaa	I did it, by praying, being around people that love you, living life to the fullest........    Iam not Christian, but God was the main one that picked me up.|`|MyV9qm99aa	Through Jesus Christ(pray). Jesus had betrayers and no friends and he stilled lived through destruction. He even died for our sins and prayed.    GOD BLESS|`|da4zS4AOaa	Through Jesus Christ|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I enjoy exercise.  And dogs.|`|V7D1DUizaa	Through Jesus, of course! Go to a local church and see all God has in store for you! Life is so much easier when you know there's a happy ending.     Also, my basketball coach always says if you're feeling down, pick someone else up. Trying to make other people happy and focusing on your loved ones helps you realize that you're not the only one struggling through life, and it takes your mind off your own troubles.      Some helpful Bible verses:  I hereby command you: Be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. (Joshua 1:9)    You who have made me see many troubles and calamities?   Will revive me again;  From the depths of the earth   ?You will bring me up again.? (Psalm 71:20)    ?? For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope. (Jeremiah 29:20)    The Lord bless you and keep you;?  The Lord make His face to shine upon you, and be gracious unto you;?  The Lord lift up his countenance upon you, and give you peace. (Numbers 6:24-26)    :)|`|AA12301710	Through Jesus.  He came to lift the heads of those weak in spirit.|`|x5f6AqDBaa	through yourself and your own will no matter how broken is your heart nobody but you will be able to lift it up again,try having a new circle of friends,going out for a walk, take a short trip or just relax and listen to some beautiful music you will feel a lot better good luck!

WjVTrHEwaa	Honestly, that sounds like a weird and useless class assignment.    But, your comment does not seem any more inappropriate than the overall subject matter. There is nothing wrong with being black or white any more than there is anything wrong with having brown or blond hair. If the entire class was black and someone pointed at me and said I stand out because I am white, it would make total sense and I would not think of that as a negative comment.    If you really feel bad about it then you can always talk with the black student.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	The class won't remember. You didn't say anything negative. If the guy is your friend then he knows that.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Um apologise to him !|`|WpaQKpckaa	As long as you make sure your friend didn't take it the wrong way, you should be okay.|`|1s6mQJqOaa	Tell the guy you where sorry, let him know that you did not mean it and you where not thinking.

You were pointing out the fact that his skin color was different from the others in the room. If it will make you feel better, go to him and explain with an apology if you embarrassed him. We all stick our foot in our mouths from time to time. Good luck.|`|CvVgihRtaa	Hi,  I think this black guys in your class already knows he has different texture hair and darker skin colour.  He was also already forewarned by the teacher that he would be picked on.  So I do not think he was hurt by your outburst.    And if that's all you said about him (about the things he has no control of, which he was born with), then you did him no harm.  Further, it was not even said in a derogatory way.      Anyway,  since you are uncomfortable with what you said . . . then speak to him and let him know that you did not intend to hurt his feelings in any way and that you were embarrassed about doing it.     I'm glad you are not a racist.|`|qs76860Daa	It wasn't racist so don't feel bad. You were just pointing out an obvious difference. Your teacher shoud've known better than to place the student in that position. Don't worry, we all say things that we regret later. It happens.|`|e4hPmzw5aa	ok...|`|ctllbI8Uaa	aw sorry =[  i'd feel embarrassed too.|`|xzpZNMgeaa	tell the kid what you just said.  you didn't mean to be racist, you meant to say that he was the "odd one out", but still good.

Everyone does this one time or the other. Take it easy on yourself because, making life harder on you is the others'  job.|`|elAfZpqaaa	Well.......    If he was green or purple than I'm sure it wouldn't of mattered as much cuz they tend to not be bothered by people pointing out that they're green or purple.    The only reason why anyone should be offended is if you called him by the "N" Word, cuz that would be like someone calling you a B*tch or something ;)|`|XXlAs7QCaa	well tell your friend you didnt mean it in the wrong way

God promised it to Abraham in Genesis 12 and God doesn't break promises.|`|B5Y46XBoaa	Because God said it was an "everlasting covenant" and God doesn't lie. God also warned that Israel would be scattered to the four corners of the earth, but would be brought back to the promised land, which is exactly what happened. Those who believe otherwise and continue to wage this war against Israel might want to consider what the rest of the prophecy says; because it's not looking good for them... not good at all.|`|6rwIm5Gnaa	This question breaks into 2 fractions. One, that the promise was uncondtional, 2nd, that the promise was conditional. From here, its interpretation on how they were promised.  But the irony of this in the bible, is in the end, there will be a new heaven and new earth. Just look at the spirit of things and the truth will set you free. Who would want others to feel less, therefore, competing with one another? ...This is what is spiritually happening with this type of question.  Read between the lines, and you will see that it is the antichrist spirit or satan and his dominions. This is how divide and conquer works. But the spirit can be identified by its fruits of wickedness in high places and principalities. I think its important to identify the spirit behind the question of things. We should do this with all things, questions, actions, images, or any manifestation so we can identify the spirit before the physical matters.|`|j1vjNjDiaa	Because they are & YHWH God said so.  SO are U going to call YHWH a liar?

Amos 9:8  Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom, and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the LORD.  9  For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.    Who is Israel?  Has the prophecy of the return of Israel to her homeland been fulfilled?  Understanding this is the most timely question of our age.    http://angelmessage.org/judahs_sceptre/i...    http://www.britam.org/    http://www.ucg.org/booklets/US/    http://www.cog21.org/abip.html|`|DNwyiiapaa	Because, God obviously helped them out in the Holocaust, didn't he?      6 million Jews couldn't be wrong!|`|ATPPWOpWaa	It was written many thousands of years ago in the Bible the following prophesy concerning the Jews.  (1) The Jewish Temple of God would be destroyed.  (2) The Jews would be driven from their homeland(which included Jerusalem)which would then be held by others.  (3) The Jews would be scattered and oppressed.  (4) The Jews would come back home to re-occupy their homeland permanently.  (5) The Jews would again speak a common language.  (6) The Jews would rebuild the Temple of God.    Here is what has came true so far;    (1) In 70 A.D. The Romans destroyed the Temple of God.  (2) The Jews were carried off into bondage into Babylon in 606 B.C.. and the Jewish homeland occupied by others.  (3) The Jews were scattered and oppressed and were victims of genicdal attempts.  (4) The Jews came back to reclaim and inhabit their homeland of Jerusalem and surrounding areas now called Israel in 1948 A.D.  (5) Most Jews now speak a version the dead language of Hebrew and is the defacto official language of government.  (6) The Jews have the blueprints ready to rebuild the Temple of God and will do so when they hold the patch of land called the 'Dome of the Rock' which is controlled by the Muslims.    The Bible even gives a description of the time table for the Jews losing their homeland in 606 B.C. and then coming home in 1948 A.D.   Heres the scripture and the math;    *Ezekiel 4:4-6 says that the Jews will suffer 430 years of punishment for their disobedience.      *In 606 B.C. Israel (Judah) was taken into captivity by Babylon for exactly 70 years and the Jews punishment begins.      *This leaves 360 years of punishment left after serving 70 years in Babylon.      *Israel still didnt turn to God in which the usual punishment was-  "And after all this, if you do not obey Me,  then I (God) will punish you seven times more for your sins." (Leviticus 26:18)      *360 years of remaining punishment times Seven= 2,520 years.      *Now add this remaining 2,520 years of unpaid punishment to the 70 years of the punishment of Babylon paid for and you get 2,590 total years of punishment.      *Now add this 2,590 years of punishment to 606 B.C. and you get the year 1985 A.D. which doesnt mean anything because....     The Hebrews used a 360 day year.  We use a 365.25 day year(.25 for leap year).  Thus, we need to convert Jewish years into our years.     2,590 total Jewish years of punishment times 360 days = 932,400 total days.     Now divide this 932,400 days by our 365.25 day system and you get 2,553 of our years.     Thus, the total punishment for the Jews was 2,553 of our years.     *Now subtract this 2,553 years of total punishment from the year 606 B.C. and you get the year 1947.       *Wrong Year?    Nope, there was no year "0" B.C. or A.D. Therefore you add 1 year.     *1947 + 1 = 1948 A.D.  Not bad for a book "made up by men" thousands of years ago.|`|MMImKRAgaa	its true|`|X548yCR6aa	Which Israelites do you mean? This one doesn't.    I think I live in a democratic country established in 1948 with the support of the British mandate. It has a religious identity as well, one that I don't care about at all.  The promised land of Canaan was actually way bigger, including parts of Syria and Jordan. Meh, I say, this is ancient history. We have much more recent problems.|`|vHcaWpV5aa	Because they have better weapons than the palistinians!|`|AXoAMEY5aa	Would you return your land after committing genocide, infanticide, and rape towards all the inhabitants of Canaan?|`|d048b4eb489b032ecf72e024f9815278aa	To answer this briefly: Their book (The bible) says they are the chosen people. I do not believe in their religion or any of it branches, but if you are a person that follows the bible you must believe that everything (as stated in the Bible) is the word of "God" and the word cannot be change or go away. Thus, no matter what happens in the world at anytime the jews are the chosen people out of all God's so-called children (I guess God can play favorites) and they have a promise land.    But as I said, I don't believe in that hogwash|`|6qIJrYDDaa	Those that have the will and the means to do so control the world that we live in today. We are taught from the day we learn to walk what is right and what is wrong. We are programmed with the things in life we must fear and those that we must follow.|`|nIu8zVkXaa	Oh, I don't know, maybe it has something to do with the fact that they believe in God and in His Words and Promises.  It's just a guess but I would think that's what causes them to believe that plus there was no time limit placed by God on how long they would be the chosen people (by the way, too bad you don't understand why they are the chosen people) or His promise for them.|`|XSh0u9Kwaa	Does not matter what the Israelites think, God will keep His promise.    Lev 26:44  'Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so abhor them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God.  Lev 26:45  'But I will remember for them the covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.'"    Psa 89:28  "My lovingkindness I will keep for him forever, And My covenant shall be confirmed to him.  Psa 89:29  "So I will establish his descendants forever, And his throne as the days of heaven.  Psa 89:30  "If his sons forsake My law, And do not walk in My judgments,  Psa 89:31  If they violate My statutes, And do not keep My commandments,  Psa 89:32  Then I will visit their transgression with the rod, And their iniquity with stripes.  Psa 89:33  "But I will not break off My lovingkindness from him, Nor deal falsely in My faithfulness.  Psa 89:34  "My covenant I will not violate, Nor will I alter the utterance of My lips.  Psa 89:35  "Once I have sworn by My holiness; I will not lie to David.    Ezek 37:21  "And say to them, 'Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will take the sons of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from every side and bring them into their own land;    Ezek 39:28  "Then they will know that I am the LORD their God because I made them go into exile among the nations, and then gathered them again to their own land; and I will leave none of them there any longer.  Ezek 39:29  "And I will not hide My face from them any longer, for I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel," declares the Lord GOD.

R4WX5twzaa	Valentine's gifts are stupid, in my opinion. If you wanna get him a gift, wait until his birthday or Christmas. A card will suffice perfectly fine. Men don't really expect gifts on V-day.     Last Valentine's Day, when my boyfriend and I had only been together for about a week and a half, we went to Build-A-Bear Workshop and we made a bear and we both put a heart in it. It was kinda cute.

Make the day be about her. Cook her her favorite meal, rent a movie you know that she will enjoy (even if you wouldn't), make her a homemade card. Just spend time with her. That is normally appreciated more than big bucks spent on material things.|`|FebNOmqDaa	There are some low budget gifts available from Walmart and DrugStore as well as pretty jewelry from diViene. But if you are short on the money, then doing something special for her will be better than any presents like breakfast in bed with a single red fresh flower, picnic in the park over lunch and surprise her with a love poem, small favorite treats that she like, candlelight dinner at home accompanied by soothing romantic music, watching a romantic movie, etc. The point is to make time for her and focusing on her needs. Goodluck.|`|sto6AoRtaa	Go small, like get a package of ready-to-make cookie dough (that's like a dollar) and have her come to ur house for a night of fun, and use the money you would have taking her out to dinner to get her some chocolate.

Flowers and chocolate is too cliche. Me and my old fiance.. we were young and broke all the time but we had SO much fun, going on adventures, walking around and just finding things to do outside.

Its really quite simple to understand once you come down off your Pedestal ...  the word "God" is a title and not His name!!!  Haaa! Oh yeah, that's right.  So God actually took care of that a long time ago and you'll have to find something else to wag your finger at.  Really, there's much more important stuff.   The correct pronunciation of Gods name "YHVH"  has been lost for centuries.  So ... no one really uses His name in vain.  Also, using a name in vain doesn't just mean using it with a dirty word, it means also using it without the high purpose of worship, prayer, praise, etc.     There's bigger fish ... really.|`|lkxFy681aa	I do it more.

Homecoming is a wierd name though.|`|AA10232076	It's like a football thing, and usually the graduates from previous years come to the game, so it's homecoming for the alumni. So then, since it's such a big thing around the school, there's a dance for the current students to celebrate too. (Homecoming is not at the end of football season, it's towards the middle, around late September/early October)|`|N9VN9bwfaa	No, no, no -- the football teams go play at other schools through the season.  Then at the end of the season they come back "home."  Home is their own school.  When they play at their own school, they are the "home team."  More people come to see that game because the local parents can come after work more easily and so on.  So there's a "home advantage."  They know the field better -- another "home advantage."  And there's the psychological advantage of people rooting for the "home team."  So the people vote and elect a "homecoming king and queen" and hope especially for a victory in that game.  My goodness, I'm surprised y'all don't know that.  I don't even like football and I know that!

A5HPUGxraa	it is not 'haram' or forbidden to keep them for good memories once i saw a program they explained it the forbidden thing is to put them on walls or to have statuses or so     the wisdom behind it is that there are times humans started to worship those things instead of god because they simply forgot what prophets told them after years and years generation after generation they just wanted to appreciate their grand fathers and people so they thought they can worship them!  it is just a procedure for caution that's all    good luck with your photos i myself take hundreds of them and post them in social networking sites to share them with family and friends.. there is no single problem in that :)|`|8n2NO6UVaa	No, it is not haram, i always take photos.    You can ask questions in Ramadhan category, go to society and culture, then Holidays, then Ramadhan.|`|klYQZPi5aa	Shaykh Ibn Baaz (may Allaah have mercy on him) said  refuting those who regard them as the same - : You have made a mistake by regarding them as the same and drawing an analogy, for two reasons:     1  A photograph cannot be likened to the image in a mirror, because a photograph does not disappear and the temptation caused by it is still there.     As for the image in a mirror, it is not permanent and it disappears when the person who is facing the mirror goes away. This is an obvious difference which no man with any common sense can dispute.     2  The text that came from the infallible Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) forbids images in general and states that things that are like photographs are forbidden, such as images on garments and walls.      It is narrated from him (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) in several saheeh ahaadeeth that when he saw that Aaishah had a curtain in which there were images, he got angry and tore it down and said: The most severely punished of people on the Day of Resurrection will be the image-makers).     In another hadeeth he said: The makers of these images  and he pointed to the images on the cloth  will be punished on the Day of Resurrection and it will be said to them: Give life to that which you have created.     And it is proven that he (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) erased the images that were on the walls of the Kabah on the day of the Conquest (of Makkah), which come under the same ruling as photographs. If we accept that photographs are like images in mirrors, then we cannot draw an analogy because it is established in shareeah that there is no room for analogy when there is a text, rather analogy comes into play when there is no text as is well known to the scholars of usool and all scholars. End quote from Majmoo Fataawa al-Shaykh Ibn Baaz (27/442).     It says in Fataawa al-Lajnah al-Daaimah (1/673): Photography is not like the reflected image seen by one who stands in front of the mirror, because that is a fleeting image that disappears when the person moves away from the mirror, whereas the photograph is permanent and remains after the person moves away from the camera, and it may be the cause of fitnah with regard to belief (aqeedah) or it may be a cause of temptation (as in the case of pictures of women). Photographs may be used in cases of necessity on some occasions and put in passports, identity documents, residency permits and drivers licences, for example.     Photography is not only the reflection of an image, rather it is created by means of a machine that captures the image, therefore it is trying to match the creation of Allaah using this machine. Moreover the prohibition on image-making is general because it involves trying to match the creation of Allaah and it poses a danger to religious beliefs and morals, regardless of the tools used or the method in which the images are made. End quote.     And Allaah knows best.  Islam Q&A
LuN1unJ3aa	It wasn't the geography, but the weakness of the powers then in control. The roman empire had splintered over politically-motivated religious issues and neither side was strong enough to stand by itself.    The battles were fierce and final - the empires of the north were destroyed and the territory was lost to the nomadic tribes that made up the majority of Islam at the time. The freedom to practice what was perceived to be a pagan religion was made possible by the conquering of the remnants of the old empire.    It should be noted that the swiftness by which the empire folded surprised even the Muslims.    Edit: It should also be noted that these conquerors were not united and therefore, amassing great armies to overcome natural boundaries was not going to happen (and didn't). Europe generalized the "Moors" into one people, but they really weren't, so when some real power was met, the "Moors" were easily defeated.|`|MMImKRAgaa	people by war and death|`|wia35rNKaa	short quick videos on youtube    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTKDtiD-e...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urlBKsH2v...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Dxs5Xaz...

Mnv3wUcVaa	Pro - Choice, with some minor rules. I don't believe in late term abortions.     I would not have one - my gf and I want children so I have no reason to have one. However, if I were raped and the child inside me were a result of that - I don't know that I would carry it. Luckily, I am not faced with that decision.    I took my sister in law to the clinic to have an abortion. She was unemployed and had just left her abusive husband and then found out that she was pregnant. She already had 4 children and could barely support them - much less another. I personally, would have carried the child - but this was her choice. She had one - and I support her decision. If she had decided to carry the child - she would not have given it up for adoption. I think she could have and that would have been a better option - but it was not my choice to make.     I don't think that abortion should be illegal. I do think that late term abortions should be illegal. I don't think they should perform an abortion after 3 months of pregnancy.|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Pro-choice!    A woman has the right to do whatever the hell she likes with her own body. All these pro-life people make me feel sick because they are not the ones that will have to live with the consequences.|`|283tO9j9aa	Pro-choice. It's none of my business what another woman does with her body, and I hope that if I am in a situation where I have to make that difficult decision all options will be available to me.    I have never had an abortion, but since I started having sex I have said that if I got pregnant I would at this stage in my life. I would not want to waste all this time in education by getting pregnant straight away- I would have a lot of student debt from my studies and I couldn't afford to give a child a decent life. Plus I really don't feel ready for children. However, I am coming up to the end of my time at university, and if I happened to get pregnant once I'm in a job then I would just deal, you know? Once my life is stable I'll probably decide I do want kids anyway.    Ultimately I think that pro-choice is not pro-abortion. I am pro-choice, but I think that the real issue is preventing unwanted pregnancies as much as possible by promoting the use of contraception and not having sex until you're ready to deal with the consequences (physical and emotional). People will have sex regardless of how much they're told it'll send them to hell, so the best thing to do is make sure they're safe while they're doing it. And that includes keeping abortion legal so that those who make that decision can have the procedure done in hospital where it is clean and they can be looked after- both in terms of medical treatment and counselling if they want it.|`|yqI6Nfpfaa	Choice.|`|rUgC7SPsaa	I am all about allowing women to have safe and accessible healthcare.

Personally, it seem the much more ethically correct decision.    That said, I can not presume to support a suggestion to have the state tell a woman she cannot make that decision for herself. While she may owe a responsibility to her lover, husband, parents, etc; she has the fundamental right to self determination and personal freedom.     To suggest otherwise is to deny that fundamental human right. There is also - obviously - the potential life of the child conceived that should - as a matter of course be considered as a factor in her decision making, and to that end this is where I would choose to grant the possibility of life to the unborn. Nevertheless circumstances may dictate otherwise for a myriad of unforseable reasons for which it would be foolish for us to try and speculate.    There is caricature of the decision to terminate a pregnancy as some glib decision as if deciding whether to have Tomato or Chicken soup for lunch. I suspect that serves as salve to an already aggrieved soul.    In this way, the decision, either way is a heavy burden to bear, I'm sure.    I will say this however, recently the folks over at CatholicVote.com put together a compelling piece of advertisement that was seriously impressive in the excellent use of music and media, I may not agree with the message in it's entirety but it was compelling.     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2CaBR3z8...|`|FRokosDjaa	I believe in both!

N9VN9bwfaa	Yes and no.  Poseidon was originally a river god whom the Greeks later made into their principal god of the sea.  Earlier they'd had a different sea god named Nereus who became supplanted by Poseidon.  They had lots of stories about both of these and about other soggy gods and goddesses.    The Romans, on the other hand, had deities but few stories.  So when they conquered the Greeks, they generally identified each of their own deities with one of the Greek deities and simply borrowed the Greek stories wholesale.  But often there were subtle differences in cult.  Neptune is somewhat more chthonic than Poseidon ever was.  Neptune's festival was celebrated at the height of the dry season of summer, which was the season of death, you see.  He had a companion spirit whose name was sometimes given as Salacia, sometimes as Venilia.  But this is about as far as the Romans went toward giving old Neptune a life.  He was associated with a sanctuary between the Palatine and Aventine hills at Rome at a spot where a stream once flowed (it has since dried up).  So perhaps he too was originally a minor deity of sweet waters and not the sea.  But his name is cognate with the Sanskrit Napsara, it seems, also a watery deity, though not the sea.    The latter was the netherworld among the Hurrians, among whom there were some speakers of a language related to Sanskrit and Old Persian.    But getting back to Poseidon, he was supposedly married to a sea nymph named Amphytrite but had no children by her.  Instead, like Zeus, he was a dreadful husband and fooled around right and left, having innumerable affairs and illegetimate kids: the Cyclops, the giant Chrysaor, that winged horse Pegasus, Nauplius, the Aloadae, Cercyon, Sciron, Lamus, Orion, and so on.  Besides these mostly badly behaved kiddoes, he sometimes turned into a horse, created earthquakes (which Neptune never did), and even attacked Demeter (something Neptune wouldn't even have dreamed of doing to Ceres, the faded Roman version) by whom he had a daught whose name it was forbidden to mention, so I won't lest your ears fall right off your head!    Another oddity was that sometimes Poseidon was half fish (never true of Neptune who stubbornly insisted on remaining all human looking) and his chariot in the waves (which seems impractical to me) was pulled by peculiar looking beasties which were half horse and half snake, another mighty odd thing.  Romans didn't care for half-anything, but this kind of division of bodies was very popular among the Greeks.  Also, Poseidon usually carried a big fork, like a tuna fisherman.  Neptune started off as a stream, so he just looked a forty-year-old man who might be found sitting next to a well.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Yes. Neptune is the Latin name for the Greek god Poseidon. It is possible that Neptune was a particularly Italian sea-deity before the classical era, but the Romans quickly assimilated him with the Greek god (as they did with most of their deities).|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	They are the same god, Neptune is Roman and Poseidon is Greek. The Romans had the habit of borrowing different ideas and things from other cultures. When it came to religion, they weren't too creative. so they happily took the Greek's divinities, they just christened them with Roman names.

They were born for the specific purpose of being killed by God to make a point.    The slaughter was the "only" way to change the Egyptian king's mind.  (Though surely an "omnipotent" being could have done any number of things far less drastic to do so.)    Everything that God does is Just even if you can't see it.         a)  Everything God does is Just and Good by definition.       b)  God's might makes right.

z2k3sQn1aa	Babies pick up languages quickly because they NEED to learn. If it wants something it cries. But the parent doesn't know if that cry means it's hungry or if it needs its nappy changed. This is frustrating for the child so it tries to mimic what the parent is saying to get its point across. Its a gradual process - word for word at first, and then it may take years to fully grasp the grammar (some adults can't even use proper grammar!)    The same applies when an adult moves to a foreign country. They are immersed in a foreign language 24/7 and so are forced to learn. In a classroom situation you have the luxury to revert back to your native language after the lesson is over and thus the stream of thought is broken.|`|7360955bdb6204c33b9cfd068b9d6cf7aa	my friend from Moldova spoke only Russian and Romanian, not a word of English, before coming to the US.

[i could SMELL blood- and i used to always end up tasting blood, speed, strength,knowledge, slowaging, and special abilitied]  after a few years i began researching the topic. and i found out i was one.   now let me make it clear that vamps- do sleep in beds, we do it normal food, we drink normal drinks, we CAN go out into the sunlight[we just get headached/migranes, minor burns or skin irritation], we have noticiably diffrent color around our iris in our eyes, we have shallower breathing than people, we can somtimes change your mood,our nails our extremly clear yet strong, we are quicker than normal people, we learn quikcker and are smarter, we have better senses -stronger more powerful senses, electronics normally go crzy around us [but sometimes they dont, like rightnow my computer is being normal], we can taste smells, we arent scared by loud noises or movie noises, some of us are extremly pale [and i say some because i am a rare dark skinned vamp] , and we are much more energetic at night.     there are alot more but its TOO MUCH. for more information on us you can visit this website, created by a vampire on information on vamps.     hope i helped. vote best answer.    all the proof you need and then some :    vampirewebsite.net|`|2s7V2wSPaa	I was very curious about vampires too so I happen to stumble by a website one day by searching "vampires real" on google.

But here goes: The rich, old white guys who are trying to get abortion criminalized again aren't concerned with life; they're concerned the birth rate among white people is dropping too much, since minority women are less prone (and less able) to abort an accidental or unplanned pregnancy. I may be wrong, but this is what I have seen, given their behavior.

Did He announce, "Let there be light"? Actually, no. There is no such verse in the Qur'an. What He did do will sound very familiar from a scientific point of view. He said the word "Be," and an object like a ball (or something equivalent to it) appeared, and then He split it into pieces. The materials from this initial explosion were the building blocks for all things in the universe. The force of that blast continues to expand and spread this matter in all directions even to this day. The Qur'an is very clear when it says, "Don't the people who hide the truth see that space and the earth were all joined together in one unit of creation and then We split them apart?" (Qur'an 21:30) Does this statement ring a bell? Scientists would call this description amazingly close to the modern concept of the Big Bang. After this great explosion of matter, the Qur'an mentions that the heavens were filled with a kind of smoke. (For Arabs in the seventh century, this is how interstellar gases would have looked to them.) The formation of planets and stars soon followed, and the fact that they have regular orbits is stated in the Qur'an, as well: "By the rotation of the stars and the orbit and setting of the planets, by the night as it falls and the morning as it passes, certainly, this is the speech of an honored Messenger." (Qur'an 81:25) Interestingly enough, the Qur'an also describes the movement of bodies in space by using the Arabic word for swim. Planets and stars are swimming in their courses. As we know today, space is not empty and the objects within it move at a measurable pace not unlike a person gliding under water. The Qur'an even correctly identifies the sun as a giver of light (siraj) and the moon as a reflector of light (munir).  It Is Written "We built the universe with [creative] power and We are certainly expanding it. We spread the Earth out wide and how excellent We ordered it! And We created every [living] thing in pairs so you could get a reminder. (Quran 51:4749) Mathematical Miracle of the Quran. Simple facts. Like the Quran itself, the Quran's mathematical Miracle ranges from the very simple , to the very complex. The simple facts are those observations that can be ascertained without using any tools. The complex facts require the assistance of a calculator or a computer. The following facts do not require any tools to be verified, but please remember they all refer to the original Arabic text: 1- The first verse 1:1 known as "Basmalla" consists of 19 letters. 2-This verse was revealed to Muhammed after 74:30, which states "Over it is 19". not a coincidence. 3-The Quran consists of 114 suras, which is 19X6. 4-The total number of verses in the Quran is 6346, or 19X334 (6234 numbered verses and 112 unnumbered verses (Basmalla). 6234+112=6346. notice also that 6+3+4+6= 19 5-The Basmalla occurs in the Quran 114 times, despite its conspicuous absence from Sura 9 (it occurs twice in Sura 27) and 114 = 19 X 6 6-From the missing Basmalla of Sura 9 to the extra Basmalla of Sura 27, there are precisely 19 Suras. 7-It follows that the total of the sura numbers from 9 to 27 9+10+11+12..... . +26+27) is 342, or 19X 18 8-This total (342) also equals the number of words between the two Basmallas of sura 27. and 342 = 19X18 9-The famous first revelation (96:1-5) consists of 19 words. 10-This 19-worded first revelation consists of 76 letters, & 76=19X4 11-Sura 96, first in the chronological sequence, consists of 19 verses. 12-This first Chronological sura is placed atop the last 19 suras. 13-Sura 96 consists of 304 Arabic letters and 304 = 19X16 14-The last revelation (Sura 110) consists of 19 words. 15-14 different Arabic letters, form 14 different sets of "Quranic Initials" (Such as A.L.M., of 2:1) and prefix 29 suras.These numbers add up to 14+14+29=57 19 X 3 16-The total of the 29 sura numbers where the Quranic initials occur is 2+3+7....+50+68=822, and 822 +14 (14 sets of initials)=836 =19X44 17-Between the first intialed Sura (Sura 2) and the last intialed Sura (Sura 68) there are 38 un-initialed suras , 38=19X2 18-Between the first and last initialed sura there are 19 sets of alternating "initialed" and "uninitialed" Suras, 19-The Quran mention 30 different whole numbers throughout, 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,19,20,30,40,5... 3000,5000,50,000, & 100,000. The sum of these numbers is 162146 = 19X8534 The following 2 facts may need some help with a calculator. 20- The word God (ALLAH) occurs throughout the Quran in its 114 Suras 2698 times and 2698= 19X142. 21-The number of verses where the word God occurs add up to 118123 also a multiple of 19, = 19X6217 22-The Quran's dominant message is that there is only "ONE GOD" The word 'One", in Arabic "Wahid" in reference to God occurs 19 times throughout the Quran. 23-The word "Wahid" itself, (one) has a numerical value of 19.

apMjpmogaa	Yes and no.   Do I believe that people who die stick around to haunt people? No. The Bible does include a couple of mentions of dead people appearing to living people. See Matthew 17 and 1 Samuel 28. But those were both special circumstances and not at all similar to "ghost" experiences.    I do believe in ghostly imitations of dead people (especially in the case of suicide victims). These, however, are rarely, if ever, ghosts. They are demons. Demons can take on any shape or form that they want and can choose to be visible or invisible. They are generally stronger and smarter than humans, which means that you have good reason to be afraid.     They do not die and have been around since before the first human, and I am sure they have excellent memories. When a person has been messing with the occult or other supernatural practices they pick up a "'familiar" or spirit guide (really a demon) who gets to know them intimately. When they die that demon can pull off a very convincing imitation of the person.     Why do they do this? Power. The Bible says that Satan and his demons are in rebellion against God. The more human souls they can turn (or keep turned) from obedience to God, the larger their kingdom. See Ephesians 6:12.    If you do have any experiences with ghosts, seek out a Christian you trust who has had experience dealing with demons. Christians have power over demons because of Jesus Christ, who has authority over them because He is God.|`|qEIURrnJaa	Yes, I believe in ghosts, spirits, god, angels, saints and demons and an afterlife.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	The fundamental delusion of humanity is to suppose that I am here and you are out there.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	If you believe in God, then you need not fear death or ghosts.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|IqqaA2wIaa	they are demons....dont mess with them.|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	From ages 14-16 I lived in a 250+ year old farmhouse.

Edit: Yea i agree with the above answer those choices look nicer|`|Nl64RmRWaa	Go with the second outfit, it's sexy. The first one wouldn't suit a dark haired female.. It was more for a blonde.

Something that she can feel really sexy in.|`|agwxFmITaa	Tell you the truth?  I think there is something distinctly sleazy about women in school uniform.  What is THAT about?  The first one was pretty and would suit a dark haired girl as well as a blonde. And hearts are right for Valentines day.|`|lOp2gVxJaa	Well thats not underwear.|`|RDZzKsflaa	Just make sure she won't be offended by it, I might be a bit freaked if my fiancee bought me "dress up" underwear. But if she already has stuff like that, then fine. Make sure you get the correct size because it might be awkward for both of you if you get too bigger/smaller a size. I think the colours will be fine, they will suit most complexions.|`|k1REVuYNaa	the first one is sexier. You should buy her that one.|`|LOWWquKkaa	Never mind what we think.  What do you?

He, like everyone else, has freedom of speech.    EDIT: Oh, jeez, I didn't know the kid broke in and vandalized the church. That means they were stolen wafers, and that is not right, it's illegal. This touches a whole new dimension.|`|d352d88dd2ccd5e746b195aabb1b47e3aa	I need to tell you, the video should have been removed because of the following reasons....  1.  The boy broke into the church;  2.  the boy vandalized the church  3.  the boy tried to do as much damage as possible  4.  the boy showed very little respect for the things that were considered sacred in the eyes of the church.  5.  the boy did not defile the wafers---because the priest has to bless the wafer during the mass in order for it to be sanctified and blessed.  Until that happens, the wafer is the wafer.  Please do not get me wrong, it is disrespectful, rude, blatant and lame.  Rude, Arrogant and other terms I need not write.  6.  Be assured---the boy is his own worst enemy in this lifetime and in the world to come.  The courts have the video and they have him.  Nuff said.    God Bless America|`|hbCs2X7Eaa	While I feel people really need to wake up to foolishness that is religion, I don't think pissing them off is the way to do it.

When the priest consecrates the host, he asks that God "let it become for us the body and blood of our lord and savior Jesus Christ."    See that 2 word prepositional phrase "for us"?    That means if it's not "for us," then it isn't, and never was, the true body of Christ.  If a host falls on the floor before the communicant can swallow it, then it is no longer the body of Christ.  It's just a wafer.    The same with people who think they're being so shocking by "desecrating" it.  If it isn't being swallowed by a person, then it isn't and never was the Body of Christ.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	It's disrespectful and unnecessary.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	It's a cracker, with or without the nonsense ritual.    edit: Some "people" think Santa actually eats the cookies they leave out on Christmas Eve, that doesn't make it true, nor does it automatically deserve respect.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	People with no faith have desecrated the symbols of those that do have faith...for centuries. This is nothing new...nor is it anything to get worried about. Man is sinful. We already know that...so why should it come as any surprise to you?|`|dDMOJWxwaa	The host itself is nothing but a wafer, it is the symbolism behind it.  The LDS wear garments, they are not magic, but there is meaning to them.  Jews wear a cap, Muslims wear a turban, and it goes on and on.  Desicrating something sacred is mocking it hoping for a response.    To respond in a Christlike way cannot be scripted or based on a formula. The Savior responded differently in every situation. When He was confronted by wicked King Herod, He remained silent. When He stood before Pilate, He bore a simple and powerful testimony of His divinity and purpose. Facing the moneychangers who were defiling the temple, He exercised His divine responsibility to preserve and protect that which was sacred. Lifted up upon a cross, He uttered the incomparable Christian response: Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34).    Some people mistakenly think responses such as silence, meekness, forgiveness, and bearing humble testimony are passive or weak. But, to love [our] enemies, bless them that curse [us], do good to them that hate [us], and pray for them which despitefully use [us], and persecute [us] (Matthew 5:44) takes faith, strength, and, most of all, Christian courage.

Never talk to Him again?  b) How do plan on holding them. There all His. Plan on sneaking in to heaven and taking them all. And then crawling down to hell and capturing those souls to. And don't forget about us that are still on earth. Are you going to put us in prison?  c) "This a pay"? What does that mean? You need an english lesson. Maybe God can arrange that while your stealing souls in heaven.      PS. My God is real and I'm sure you will meet Him soon enough. Until then think through your questions.

hgqJvz14aa	A) Our predecessors who believed in God were not "dummies" by default, nor has this ever been claimed. Being religious does not mean one cannot be a good scientist, although nowadays it can bring up problems. It was not coincidence, it was them having a higher brain power, as with any clever person. This is irrespective of religion, both back then and now.     B) Science has not found these cures yet chiefly due to time and resources. Yes, science follows logic and reasoning, but the facts remain that discovering cures involves searching the forests for chemical formulas or recreating them artificially, and then the money, staff, techniques and equipment are not present in the amount necessary for the discoveries to be made already.    It doesn't need completely logic, also: it takes degrees of imagination to present cures and the methods that lead to their replication in labs. Inspiration, if you like. Because we don't yet know everything necessary about physiology and chemistry; as I said, there has not yet been time in our learning or methods available to see everything that we need to.    I respond to B with my own query: you ask why science doesn't have the answers, but does your religion have them either?    C) The rules of society as they currently stand are mostly taken from 'holy books' due to the fact that religion has been a ruling factor in the world for thousands of years. I, being atheist, hold the view that they were originally devised and written by humans.    To this, you will say 'where did those humans get their ideas from?' Well, all intelligent life has its own social conduct and morality, if you will. The more advanced life forms such as elephants and primates (which includes apes) have complex social hierachies and form strong bonds with their family and mates. What is that but a simplified form of humanity?    Also, is it not interesting to note that over the world people have always had very similar moral codes? Back in history, before cultures had met each other, each society has similar rules governing things like theft and murder - not identical, but similar. And this is before Christianity had reached them. So how can the Christian word be the origin of our moral law?    D) This is what happens when an irresistible force meets an immovable object. We could ask you exactly the same questions back.     I am sure because I am sure: it is what I believe. I have taken into account all of the evidence for and against God's existence and I have made my decision. You have done the same. I might be wrong. You might be wrong. It's something to consider.    All in all, that question is the stalemate of this argument.    I have answered all of your questions to the best of my ability in a logical manner. I hope this is what you were looking for.|`|q9075Yawaa	A   previous generations of all people were ignorant, not 'dummies'.  they did not lack intelligence, they lacked knowledge.  important scientific discoveries were made throughout the ages by people of all cultures.  Coincidence or accident, these things happen in their own time.  in many cases important scientific discoveries were demonized by the religious sectors, and this prejudice had to be overcome with patience.    B   'yet' is the operative word here...scientists are working on the answer and it will come in time.  modern medicine is an infant in comparison to human history, and new technology brings us closer the answers every day    C   a working society does not have to be based on a book.  we have the power to control our own actions and take care of each other without the treat of eternal punishment for failure to live up to a set of  antiquated standards.    D   well....i guess i'll have to take my chances. if it turns out i'm wrong then i have only myself to blame.  i don't need to be judged and cursed by others who have taken a different path.      if your faith brings you comfort and the support you need, great, go for it.  but please do not devalue me if i choose not to follow.|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	A) Yes people discover things though trial  B) Because we were too busy finding a cure for small pox, the black plague and polio  C) Society makes rules for society retard. I don't do bad things because it's wrong. It hurts people, that's why it's bad.  D) Uhhh I believe in no god. I do it because there is a logical and scientific reason to do so.    "you're stupid" not "your" retard|`|AA11640108	A) The religion of the person making the discovery really isn't relevant.  They made the discovery due to their researching, curiosity, or dumb luck.  Are you suggesting that it was their particular God that allowed them to make the discovery?  What proff do we have either way?    B)Science is a best attempt using what we understand about our environment to understand MORE about our environment.  The people working to develop cures for diseases are doing their very best, but there is no guarantee that they will succeed.    C) The size of our brains does not seem to be an issue.  Most of us seem to grasp the rules of society by following the examples that we see, not by reading books on etiquette.  The same brains allow us to land on the moon as well.    D)Superstition would be having an irrational belief in something.  Atheists simply do not believe in God.  I do not see how non-belief can be considered a superstition.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	A) Someone can be intelligent yet hold a foolish belief. Besides, if there is a God there would be no way to prove it with science. Some scientists can have faith to but they will admit that their beliefs aren't science.    B)Science progresses. We only recently made vaccinations for chicken pox, measles, mumps, etc.    We have yet to make those discoveries yet. Duh.    C) There is nothing moral in holy books. Morals like "don't kill" and "don't steal" are built into us. Other morals are subjective and are gained through life experience.    D) The definition of "deluded" is seeing or hearing things that aren't there. Even if God isn't real, by definition we're still not deluded.    These are the dumbest questions I've ever answered.|`|acbqsZZbaa	OK,    A) It is possible to be very intelligent and still be wrong about something. Also, consider that in many societies in the past denying the existence of God could get you killed, slowly and painfully. That's quite an incentive to believe, wouldn't you say?    B) Because these are difficult problems. We will get there eventually. We eradicated smallpox, remember?    C) The rules for a civil society are very simple. There are many social animals far less intelligent than apes who have very complex social rules.    D) Superstition is the belief in something you cannot see. Atheism is the non-belief in something you cannot see (specifically, gods).  If there was any evidence for such a being and we were ignoring it then we would be deluded, as you say, but there is no evidence, so we are probably not deluded.|`|3ZgOAUOTaa	a) one can still seek to understand who "goddidit" even when insisting that "goddidit"... a fact not acknowledged by anti-science christians.    b) science is a process, not an end-all ... why don't god cure amputees?     c) fake = not "pure truth from 'god'", it doesn't say they don't contain wisdom as known to the society that wrote them ... why don't christians understand that it was men what edited the bible, and decided which book to include and exclude?    d) one cannot be superstitious without believing to something for which there is no evidence.      fail -- try again|`|wwdllMzYaa	a-theres no logic in that sentence, your saying what that because people believed we shoudl too? why question them?, thats what it sounds like your saying    b-science is real, and we humans are not perfect,  we dont have all the answers, we dont know all the answers, its liekly there IS cures out there for all thes things, but we just havent descoverd them yet    c-the rules of society, well, animals have their own sociological rules too,s so no they wre not "too small" they were just different    d-i dont deny i have superstitions  delusion doesnt come from accepting and acknowledging the information available, it comes from ignoreing it|`|ni6SCUm9aa	A) Not all religious people were dummies. The ones who denied science when it contradicted their beliefs were, the others were not. Science and religion have nothing to do with each other; they are seperate entities.    B) Because we do not have enough information. AIDS (HIV) is a constantly evolving virus; it changes to adapt to it's environment. One second we might have a cure, then it will mutate into something which is immune. Nasty little buggers. Also because of the nature of the virus, which spreads throughout the entire blood stream, making it very hard to destroy completely, and the fact that it completely destroys the immune system, making it dangerous to do anything drastic to the subject (the cure, harming the virus, may as well also kill the patient, seeing as he/she have no defenses).    There are treatments for cancer; they are simply not perfected yet.    Point is; science is not perfect. Good, yes, but it is limited to human understanding.    C) Morals, you mean? They are genetically programmed things; bad thigns are things that cause harm, and good things are things that are beneficial. It's really an easy to undesrtand concept... not complicated at all. Those things arise from empathy and altruism, both of which are genetically programed traits, which evolution gave us.    D) Superstition means an irrational belief NOT based on logic. Basically that believing is seeing.    I think that SEEING is believing, ergo, superstition does not fall into the category.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	If you don't want "you're stupid" as an answer, then you shouldn't ask questions that make you look stupid.    But I will try to answer in a straightforward way, regardless.    A) I know of not one single atheist who has claimed that everyone prior to now were dummies.  Besides, it is possibly to be correst in one area, yet wildly wrong in another.  Einstein was wrong about quantum mechanics, but he was hardly a dummie.    B) What does one have to do with the other?  Difficult problems take longer to find solutions.  So what?    C) People made the rules of society.  As evidenced by the fact that every society has had rules, and they have all been different in one way or another.  Apes today form social groups with rules of behavior, they're just simpler rules.  And they're not written in any book.    D) I'm not being superstitious in lacking a belief in deities, because I'm not claiming anything in the process.  I am declining to make a claim.|`|boqwvEvUaa	a. those discoveries were made by intelligent jews, christians, and muslims. trust me, if they didn't have high IQs, they wouldn't have discovered anything, no matter what religion they followed.   b. science is searching for cures. what's religion doing? telling people to pray, like that actually works?   c. i don't see any logic in the way you worded that. sorry, can't answer it.   d. think about it this way--if no one told you anything about religion or gods, you wouldn't believe. it's only after you've been exposed that you begin to think gods exist. clearly, atheists aren't the ones deluding ourselves.     kisses! 8D|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	A) Theism is fallacy, not necessarily stupidity.  B) Science follows evidence, it is only shaped by reason. That's the difference - the ability to adjust for new evidence - which is totally lacking in faith based belief.  C) Non-sequiturs are not arguments. The question is an absurdity, and thus impossible to address logically in any direct way.  D) There is no evidence that requires a "creator" to explain, Thus, positing one is adding an unnecessary proposition, which is unwarranted. See "Occam's Razor".|`|NCRfZRopaa	A) Scientific discoveries made by religious people has no bearing on the existence of God.    B) Because they mutate quickly. It's hard to find cures for something that changes rapidly.     C) Society makes up the rules of society. If an action is done that does harm to the society, than that action is deemed forbidden or bad. Even animals have rules, especially when it comes to food. Secondly, we ARE apes according to taxonomy.    D) Because the burden of proof for God is on the positive, the believers.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	Oh boy here we go, lots of misconceptions you have that I hope I can clear up.:    1. Never said they were dummies but when you have no science you turn to religion for the answers.  Its called the God of the Gaps.  God hides where science has not yet found an answer.  When there was no science god made it rain, after science we know he doesn't.  No one doubts that great religious men were scientists but in doing so they have helped to push god further away.    2. Because science requires work.  Nothing in science is instantaneous.  The answers don't appear by magic, we have to take time to experiment and think and refine our ideas.    3. Rousseau called it the Social Contract.  Society makes the rules.  We all agree to live in a community and because of that we sacrifice some of our freedoms to a code of laws.    4. If you can give me evidence for god I'd consider believing in him.  Anecdotes and hearsay are not evidence, show me hard empirical objective evidence.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Such a silly question!!    Atheist merely do not believe in a god of any kind.  No other agenda.  Simply no god!!    Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!    forget the mutiple questions you asked and realise they simply demonstrate the weakness of your faith!!|`|WbaN6osZaa	OK no sarcastic answers about your 'logic', no matter HOW tempting ;-)    A)  Someone can be a brilliant mathematician, yet believe that  Mork came from the planet Ork and MADE them a brilliant mathematician.  Superstition works on fear and credulity, while different parts of the brain and different emotions are used to build tools and work out sums.  EVERYONE thought the world was flat, not so long ago.  Does that mean that the world is flat?  The Earth was the center of the Universe? Does that mean they were all 'dummies'?    No.  It meant that science and discovery was young, and religion and superstition was still very strong.  Look up Galileo...Church..stuff..    B)  You made no sense whatsoever.   That's like saying 'if engineering is true, why haven't we built a new universe to live in'?  Engineering must be false!!!    Well gosh, some things are difficult, while some things are out of reach...get it?    C)  All social animals have social 'rules'.  Especially all primates.  Try studying anthropology and zoology.  Your weakness seems to be near total ignorance of anything non-religious.  Even ants have social rules.  Genetics is a large part of it,  But we humans evolved conceptual and abstract thinking abilities....    D) Maybe I am superstitious, maybe our world was really made by a megalomaniac invisible man in the sky, and also sits on the back of a giant turtle and was born from an egg on mountain top.  Maybe I should accept all creation myths as fact...and my skepticism and intellectual honesty is being tricked by pesky supernatural 'beings' all around us.    I can live with that.  All you need is faith, right?    http://www.religionnewsblog.com/20958/ma...|`|MQBKnbSFaa	You get a cookie for being an above average troll. (::)    Most atheists just do transparent parodies but you write more than most of them.|`|2SzYXPrHaa	A.  I never said religious people are dummies.      B.  Being held back by religions, perhaps?  Not an unknown occurrence    C.  Do some research on social animals.  Dogs have societal rules, as do apes.    D.  What, exactly are our superstitions?|`|a6eb6e311bd16dad988d64e4f060d69faa	A) Ancient people were in no way dummies. they probably understood more about the world than we do now. Superstitions don't exclude scientists from making breakthroughs.    B)HIV/AIDS is a mutating virus as is the common cold, I don't think science will ever be able to cure people of virus's because they mutate to quickly. Asking why we haven't found the cure for cancer yet is like asking, if we understand what anti-matter is then why aren't we using it to jet across the galaxy yet. we just haven't come to that road quite yet. more questions are needed to be answered first.    C)Back in our evolutionary past, Homo erectus, I think, began eating more meat than vegetation giving the body more protein to work with. Through the ages that protein was used to produce a larger brain. As for who made the rules for society I think people make those rules. Slavery was legal in ancient Greece, Rome, and Egypt, and prior to the American Civil war. Humans have since changed that rule.    D)I'm not being superstitious because a superstition is a belief or notion, not based on reason or knowledge, in or of the ominous significance of a particular thing, circumstance, occurrence, proceeding, or the like. I say I don't believe a god exists but never make the claim I know a doesn't exist. based on the evidence everything I've experienced can be explained by natural occurrences and not supernatural.    Hope this helps|`|AA11043053	(A) Very smart people can believe VERY dumb things. Linus Pauling received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry & the Nobel Peace Price, but he also pushed Vitamin C as a cure-all, which has been shown repeatedly to be patently untrue. Isaac Newton practically invented Physics, and indeed did invent Calculus, but he also believed in Alchemy.    (B) Science has cured many things: Small pox, polio, bacterial infections, etc. Women in the West now rarely die in childbirth, which used to be the single largest killer of women. Those, and other things, took time. AIDS has only been known for 30 years. It will take time to figure out the best ways to CURE it, but already it is for most Western sufferers now a CHRONIC disease instead of a FATAL disease.    (C) We have evolved to live as social creatures. The basic rules are don't commit murder, don't steal, & don't lie. These all help us maintain our social communities. After that, the rest of ethical rules are cultural creations.    (D) To demand evidence for the existence of something is hardly superstition. It's the same as for fairies, gnomes, elves, and Santa Claus. Belief in God is no different.|`|eUEgi111aa	atheists dont say those people are dummies. they are just people. plus, in history you were expected to say you were a beliver or suffer the consequences (killing).    just because science is about logic and reasoning doesnt mean there ARE cures for those things. how did you make that connection?    theres adifference between rules to stop people hurting each other and books that tell you to believe in an invisible being.     the default is nothing. you guys came up with a something. there is nothingness, you have faith in somethingness within that nothingness. how can the atheists be the deluded ones if they don't have this thing called 'faith', which is specifically 'believing in something without evidence'?    sorry for no caps, but i got disheartened when it was obvious you were grasping at straws and decided to type with one hand while using the other to hold my newly lit cigarette.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	A)  I never said ancient people were dummies.  Look at the wonders of   Egypt and Rome...both not Christian lands.    B)  Everything takes time.  Just because they haven't found cures for AIDS and cancer doesn't mean they won't.  There have been great advances in treatment.  Where are your god's cures?    C)  People made their own rules for society.  Try watching Orangutan Island and see how complex the orangutans social system is.  It doesn't take much intelligence to figure out right from wrong.    D)  Superstition is a belief or notion, not based on reason or knowledge.  I don't feel I am superstitious because my beliefs are based on reason and knowledge. Not fear of the unknown.  Delusion is believing in something unproven.  Not believing it is common sense.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Ok, I'm going to try to address all of your points.    a) God is the X in the equation of our world.  He is the symbol we assign to the unknown.  As unknowns become known, god gets smaller.  That is why so many religious people oppose science even when the conclusions are clear (Galileo, for example).  They prefer god to be the answer for X.    b) It's a process, not an event.  (Or a miracle, in your vernacular).    c) Man made the rules of society.  You don't believe that god created traffic lights, do you?  The rules of society are mostly just public health and safety laws that allow us to coexist efficiently.  Societies that didn't adopt good laws, died out.    d) I see no evidence to believe that your god, or anyone else's is real.  When you can present me with a credible argument, I'll revisit my position.    Take care.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	A) just because they were superstitious does not mean they were incapable of analyzing and understanding what was going on around them.  The egyptians were superstitious but their understanding of the stars and the night sky was astounding.    B) key word is YET (emphasis)  Cancer may not be able to be cured because the cause for it is inside the cells themselves.    C) other great apes (chimps and gorillas) are known to have social and family structures.  indeed ALL social animals have a working society where they protect and raise their offspring.    D) superstition n. An irrational belief that an object, action, or circumstance not logically related to a course of events influences its outcome    show me how i am superstitious.  if there is indeed a god then show me the evidence for it.  if there is none and there is and he punishes me for using my brain and not accepting his existence on blind faith then its not a god that is worth my attention.|`|m09snBrEaa	A believing in god dosn't make a person entirely stupid, some may conclude that it shows a certain failure in the believers logical skills.    B, science starts at ignorance and explains things by looking at the evidence that is found, we won't find a cure for aids until we find something to exploit to cure aids.    C, the rules of society can change over time, hence the abolition of slavery for instance. and these changes come from critisism, most theists will reject even the slightest implied critisism and simply ignore the arguments because they are talking cirtically about their holy book, culture welcomes critical thinking, and that is why we see the present world rejecting actions of the past that are no considered barbaric.    D being close minded isn't a function of rejecting an original claim, its a function of denying the possible existence of evidence that can disprove the original claim. i openly embrace the idea that evidence can come along to prove god, but I'm not going to say that god must exist strictly because there is the possibility of evidence to prove it. i go a little bit farther and require the evidence to actually be presented.|`|aN7lmNmoaa	A) Many of these discoveries had nothing to do with or even contradicted religion     B) Because science hasn't advanced that far yet. Look at all the things we have cured    C) People made the rules of society. They police themselves. By your logic, would governing bodies such as kings be gods? Because according to your logic, they would be.    D) Because atheism is a lack of superstition. This question doesn't even make any sense|`|1WisnX8naa	All being an atheist means is  ot accepting the existance of gods...    A) Not all did, and having a religion doesn't mean that people won't look for answers. Including those who believe in gods. The basics for Genetics, for instance were set by a priest. The Big Bang as well as were the findings of Galileo. Believing in a god, does not mean to shut down your brain.    B) It's working on it. Nothing was or is created in a day. We know much more about cancer now than a decade ago. Science did stop polio, but it took time. If it wasn't studied to start with there would be no cure.    C) Our brain size is the product of evolution. Man also wrote Moby Dick, but how many worship it? You question really makes no sense on many levels... if you think about it...    D) Then we are in trouble. Highly unlikely. Should we force ourselves to believe 'just in case' in somethig with no evidence?    There, four answers to your four questions with no 'your stupid' comments. Now, do you really care? Probably not, so it was a waste of time, on both our parts...|`|tEn2nnsuaa	A). they believed in superstitions, but they weren't dummies.     B). just because science hasn't found cures for cancer and aids, doesn't somehow make the entire disciple illogical. do you not believe in the theory of gravity because there isn't a cure for cancer? that doesn't seem very logical to me.    C). we evolved our morality just like all the other animals have evolved their various instincts.     D). not all atheists claim certainty that god doesn't exist. atheists just don't "believe" in god. i don't know how NOT believing in something makes me superstitious.    hope that helped.|`|GeoiGjbCaa	This can't be answered in a single yahoo post.

They discovered things because they looked for them, and the smarter ones admitted the truth.    B) Science has found cures for cancer, and may have just found a cure for AIDS (via stem cell transplant.)  Science has cured MANY diseases, so obviously it works.  It's just that some diseases are extraordinarily complex.    C) Humans make the rules of society through consolidation of power and oppression, or through consensus.  This is obvious.

I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|tsgP2JfBaa	You know that a lot of those claims are a crock, right?|`|6Whz1p5Eaa	www.zeitgeistchallenge.com      Sorry to tell you, but every fact that movie presented was a joke.

There's an old saying that misery loves company...but only here on earth...since in Hell your torment is only increased by all the damned souls that will join you there (presuming your conversion does not take place beforehand). In Hell only two wishes will be on your mind: (1) that you never existed, or that your existence could come to an end and (2) since (1) will not happen you would wish to just be alone in Hell.    The One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church, was founded by Jesus Christ, true God and true Man, outside of which there is absolutely no salvation.

dAcNaajsaa	To the person who said 'we will be nude (dont get me wrong)', what is the proof for this ? and it kind of goes against the following ayaat from other ayaat.    18:31. These! For them will be 'Adn (Eden) Paradise (everlasting Gardens); wherein rivers flow underneath them, therein they will be adorned with bracelets of gold, and they will wear green garments of fine and thick silk. They will recline therein on raised thrones. How good is the reward, and what an excellent Murtafaqa (dwelling, resting place, etc.)!      Other descriptions of Paradise.    Eg, from surah 78    31. Verily, for the Muttaqun, there will be a success (Paradise);    32. Gardens and grapeyards;    33. And young full-breasted (mature) maidens of equal age;    34. And a full cup (of wine).    35. No Laghw (dirty, false, evil talk) shall they hear therein, nor lying;    36. A reward from your Lord, an ample calculated gift (according to the best of their good deeds).      and from surah 83    22. Verily, Al-Abrar (the pious who fear Allah and avoid evil) will be in delight (Paradise).    23. On thrones, looking (at all things).    24. You will recognise in their faces the brightness of delight.    25. They will be given to drink pure sealed wine.    26. The last thereof (that wine) will be the smell of musk, and for this let (all) those strive who want to strive (i.e. hasten earnestly to the obedience of Allah).    27. It (that wine) will be mixed with Tasnim.    28. A spring whereof drink those nearest to Allah.        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...      Paradise will be physical and real and pure bliss as from these ayaat. i would suggest an excellent book which is available in english translation. It is from the Aqeedah series titled Paradise And Hell by Shaykh Umar al-ashqar if I am not mistaken. Excellent work according to the proofs of this deen insha'allaah.    From Surah 56    10. And those foremost [(in Islamic Faith of Monotheism and in performing righteous deeds) in the life of this world on the very first call for to embrace Islam,] will be foremost (in Paradise).    11. These will be those nearest to Allah.    12. In the Gardens of delight (Paradise).    13. A multitude of those (foremost) will be from the first generations (who embraced Islam).    14. And a few of those (foremost) will be from the later time (generations).    15. (They will be) on thrones woven with gold and precious stones,    16. Reclining thereon, face to face.    17. They will be served by immortal boys,    18. With cups, and jugs, and a glass from the flowing wine,    19. Wherefrom they will get neither any aching of the head, nor any intoxication.    20. And fruit; that they may choose.    21. And the flesh of fowls that they desire.    22. And (there will be) Houris (fair females) with wide, lovely eyes (as wives for the pious),    23. Like unto preserved pearls.    24. A reward for what they used to do.    25. No Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk) will they hear therein, nor any sinful speech (like backbiting, etc.).    26. But only the saying of: Salam!, Salam! (greetings with peace) !    27. And those on the Right Hand, - Who will be those on the Right Hand?    28. (They will be) among thornless lote-trees,    29. Among Talh (banana-trees) with fruits piled one above another,    30. In shade long-extended,    31. By water flowing constantly,    32. And fruit in plenty,    33. Whose season is not limited, and their supply will not be cut off,    34. And on couches or thrones, raised high.    35. Verily, We have created them (maidens) of special creation.    36. And made them virgins.    37. Loving (their husbands only), equal in age.    38. For those on the Right Hand.    39. A multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the first generation (who embraced Islam).    40. And a multitude of those (on the Right Hand) will be from the later times (generations).      There is a pleasure that is higher than the pleasure of paradise and that is looking at our Lord. there are ahadeeth on this - please see book mentioned above or do a search. From the ayaat on this are :    From surah 75    22. Some faces that Day shall be Nadirah (shining and radiant).    23.

The Prophet Pbuh told us that within Paradise are things that no eyes have ever seen, nor ears have ever heard, and that things in it are beyond our imagination and comprehension, but we all have our own personal ideas of what eternal bliss would probably be like.     There will be life after death, so yes we will be alive in Jannah.    The hearts of the people of Paradise will be pure, their speech will be good, their deeds righteous. There will be no hurtful, upsetting, offensive or provocative talk there, for Paradise is free of all worthless words and deeds.     Nick - Jannah means Paradise.

Jews make amends to those they've harmed and THEN ask G-d for forgiveness.  Much more responsible than Christianity where amends aren't necessary.|`|aO4iCwtoaa	Your translation is incorrect.  A closer match is "For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given it to you upon the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that maketh atonement by reason of the life."    But that verse is not talking about how to make atonement for sins; it is the second in a five-verse statement (Lev. 17:10-14) about not consuming blood.   It is saying that the blood is the life-force, and that we are therefore prohibited from eating it.      Animal sacrifices were a part of early Judaism, but they were not the only offerings at the Temple (grain and produce were far more common), and were not only made in atonement - most animal sacrifices were made to celebrate festivals, and were eaten (thus the need for the commandment you listed - the atonement sacrifices were only eaten by the High Priest, so Leviticus 17:10-15, which was a commandment for all of Israel and not just the High Priest - has no relevance to it).  Also, most sins did not require a sacrifice for atonement - rather, they were atoned for with either punishment or restitution.  Only very specific sins required an animal sacrifice at all - and that's just when the Tabernacle and Temples stood.  After the first Temple was destroyed and before the second was rebuilt (long before Jesus), there were no sacrifices at all, and just as we do today, atonement came through prayer, charity, and repentance.  Finally, not only is human sacrifice completely NOT permitted in Judaism (Leviticus 18:21, 24-25 - Moloch was a god requiring human sacrifices), the Torah specifically commands us not to offer sacrifices wherever we want - we are only allowed to offer sacrifices in the place that God has chosen for that purpose (Deuteronomy 12:13-14).  So a cross on a mountain with a human subject is completely unacceptable to the G-d of the Torah, and certainly not in accordance with the laws of Moses.      You are welcome to believe it as a Christian, but please don't tell Jews that we don't understand our own scriptures.

All the killing and other things that were mentioned were the people choosing to do their will.  God protected Israel because He promised Abraham, they are the Holy people and anyone who goes against them God will take vengeance on.  But, God does not condone killing or raping or anything else.  Before you judge Gods word, read the entire bible and than say something, But, then again God says the "wicked"  will not understand.  By wicked He meant the unsaved.

Dr. Cameron has dis played extreme bias against homosexuals. He has deliberately misinterpreted data, misrepresented the work of other psychologists, and altogether made up some of his "facts." He has even gone so far as to include rumors and urban legends in his supposed findings. Finally, in 1983, the APA dropped him from membership for lack of cooperation with the Committee on Scientific and Professional Ethics and Conduct.    In regards to this particular study, Dr. Cameron intentionally misrepresented the findings of Dr. A Nicolas Groth. In response, Dr. Groth wrote to the Nebraska Board of Examiners of Psychologists stating:    "[Dr. Cameron] misrepresents my findings and distorts them to advance his homophobic views. I make a very clear distinction in my writing between pedophilia and homosexuality, noting that adult males who sexually victimize young boys are either pedophilic or heterosexual, and that in my research I have not found homosexual men turning away from adult partners to children.    I consider this totally unprofessional behavior on the part of Dr. Cameron and I want to bring this to your attention. He disgraces his profession."    Unfortunately, "Homosexual Murder and Rape of Children" has been cited by many anti-homosexual groups in an attempt to validate their political views.|`|oY4vwdjVaa	Again - the toaster isn't a TV, nor does it show the news.|`|xsZfN0JHaa	Get the data on heterosexual serial killers!

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	((((((((((((Dale)))))))))))))))    I was thinking about you just today, and wondering how you were feeling. It's so good to see you again, and I'm sorry to learn that you are still feeling  poorly.     Let me say that I think the absolute world of you. Your kindness and love has always been so uplifting... I have never been offended by anything you've said, and I can't imagine that others would be. It takes a loving heart to apologize publicly. You have proven once again that you are a man of quality.    I know how much you love those around you, and I also know that others see this in you. I'm sure your prayer partners are aware of your situation, and I'm certain they have forgiven anything you might have said or done. I imagine they miss you terribly. You may want to reconsider your decision to leave them. I know how important it is to have someone to talk with, and I'm sure this was a good outlet for you. Maybe take a break, then go back.    I've been wondering how to fill my time over this long winter, and just this morning I asked about learning to knit. Perhaps there is a hobby you would like to pursue? Woodworking sounds interesting as a creative outlet, as does learning to paint, designing birdhouses, container gardening, etc.     Whatever it is that interests you, embrace it with everything you've got.     I love you so much, Dale. I  am sorry that things have turned out this way for you. I know that your strong faith will guide you through whatever obstacles you face. Know also that the hearts of your friends are filled with warm thoughts, and that our arms, if they could, would embrace you.    Please take care.    Oh, one more thing: When you are home alone, be sure to have music playing in  the background. I find that when my children are at school, the silence is deafening. Having beautiful music to fill the silence helps tremendously.    Added:     Dale, I understand pain, and the feelings of worthlessness you are experiencing. I am also aware of some of the medication you take, but have you spoken with your doctor about Dilaudid?     It's very powerful, and not all doctors will prescribe it. However, I've found that, when my pain is so bad that not even morphine will touch it, Dilaudid is what really helps. It's worth asking.    Beyond that, having a positive attitude is the best I can offer. It's so easy to become angry in our situations, and to be filled with despair. These emotions do nothing to ease our hurts, and they frequently make them worse. I feel you need to speak with your doctor about anti-depressants.     There's no shame in that, dear friend. Those of us who suffer chronic illness are frequent targets of depression. Having someone to talk to in combination with the proper medications can do wonders.     Please, for your own sake, don't give up your prayer groups. And know that we all love and want you here, so feel free to rant and rage anytime you need to vent. That's what we are here for.    @ Ahaz ... Hello husband.  I've missed you.|`|AA10554783	My first question would be to ask if you are on disability.  If a medical condition is keeping you from employment and you have enough credits of work, you should be eligible for disability.  Secondly, i would look into some grace or outright forgiveness of the student loans.  Maybe explore these options.  Contact the Ohio board of education loans for higher education and see what the forgiveness eligibility is:  Sometimes its based on disability, death etc.  Look at what you can do, sometimes they can also freeze the loan or offer a reduction in payment.  In Pennsylvania you  would contact PHEAA so I am not sure what department it would be in Ohio but I know they have one in a state office, ok.|`|RJRantBfaa	Hugs and prayers to you brother....

I too have physical problems that make it difficult for me to be out and about where I can do direct service to others....but try to help those in need when I can. Praying for the benefit of others is great. I would suggest if nothing else, that you watch your news programs and read newspapers etc...and look for people who need help and reassurance. Use your prayer skills for that ....with the full knowledge that God hears you.    God Bless you.|`|KjF0p72naa	Don't leave a prayer group because you react badly at times. Perhaps if you see a side of yourself coming to the surface that is more flesh than spirit, take time to do other things. Come to the prayer group when you don't feel like you will hurt someone because by now you can recognize the physical symptoms and emotional instability that comes with them. It is alright to have bad times, get angry, and feel pain. God just wants you to choose not to sin in these times and jumping into a group of others and lashing out in your pain does the opposite here. So no need to apologize for this. Just change your behavior and keep on going.   This is not our home. Heaven is. And until we are in the presence of Jesus, it's our responsibility to know Him more each new day.|`|9btru19waa	I sent my answer to your email.|`|AA12194228	Do you see a really good Endocrinologist?

You have no need to leave.  We love you.  You are wise beyond and loving beyond anyone I know.  You love even when people are mean and rude to you.

Wherefore, it must needs be an infinite atonement--save it should be an infinite atonement this corruption could not put on incorruption. Wherefore, the first judgment which came upon man must needs have remained to an endless duration. And if so, this flesh must have laid down to rot and to crumble to its mother earth, to rise no more.    And our spirits must have become like unto him, and we become devils, angels to a devil, to be shut out from the presence of our God, and to remain with the father of lies, in misery, like unto himself; yea, to that being who beguiled our first parents, who transformeth himself nigh unto an angel of light, and stirreth up the children of men unto secret combinations of murder and all manner of secret works of darkness.

AA11241794	In 1974? "Belle" bottoms, of course! ;)|`|MyV9qm99aa	1970s SOrry-    By 1970 women chose who they wanted to be and if they felt like wearing a short mini skirt one day and a maxi dress, midi skirt or hot pants the next day - that's what they did.    For eveningwear women often wore full length maxi dresses, evening trousers or glamorous halter neck catsuits. Some of the dresses oozed Motown glamour, others less so.     Left - Two young women in their early twenties on holiday in the Canary Islands c1972.  The short check flared skirt was very popular, as was the empire style of the diamond check pattern mini dress.  Right - Halter neck catsuit pattern of 1971.  Exotic and tropical prints were a reflection of designers gaining inspiration from foreign travel destinations.    For evening in the early seventies, either straight or flared Empire line dresses with a sequined fabric bodice and exotic sleeves were the style for a dressy occasion. Picture of office girls wearing short mini dresses. Fashion history and costume history of the 1970s.    One frequently worn style was the Granny dress with a high neck. Sometimes the stand neck was pie-crust frilled, or lace trimmed. Often they were made from a floral print design in a warm brushed fabric or viscose rayon crepe which draped and gathered well into empire line styles.    Right - Typical short and mini dresses worn at an office party in 1972/3. At the front a young girl wears a long floral granny dress that covers her knees.    Another hugely successful evening style of the 1970s was the halter neck dress, either maxi or above knee.  Left - Black halter neck dress pattern of 1971.    At a disco, girls might don hot pants. In contrast to the reveal all mini, a woman would suddenly confound men by completely covering her legs and retort that mini dresses were an exploitation, rather than a liberation of women.  Easier Travel Broadens the Fashion Mind    The influence of the self styled hippy clothes and the mish-mash of 1970s fashion from every corner of the global village crept into mainstream fashion. Easier travel meant that people brought ideas and accessories from abroad. Others looked for designers to provide styles that fitted the mood of an era, that had returned to nature and was anti-Vietnam-war in outlook.  Cars and Central Heating Bring Lighter Weight Clothes    If travel broadens the mind, enclosed eco systems alter the fabric options. By the late 1970s women travelling in enclosed heated cars could choose to wear lighter weight clothes and abandon full length coats. Homes and stores in the temperate climate of the United Kingdom almost universally became centrally heated and most women could tolerate a chill mad dash between car and front door knowing that warmth awaited them.    Long coats gradually began to decline as an essential winter buy and a series of garments from velvet jackets, quilted padded duvet coats, hip length wool velour jackets and shaded ombre dyed raincoats, were all a more usual sight as a quick cover up from the elements.  You are reading an original fashion history 1970s article written by Pauline Weston Thomas for www.fashion-era.com ?.Kaftan pattern of 1971.  Caftan or Kaftan    The Hippies of the sixties had brought with them clothes from other ethnic groupings which had often never even been seen before in the west. Nehru jackets and loose flowing robes from hot countries made their way to world cities and permeated down to mainstream fashion, helped of course by designers like Yves St Laurent.    From the mid to late 70s, caftans, kaftans, kimonos, muumuus, djellaba (a Moroccan robe with a pointed hood) or jalabiya (a loose eastern robe) and other styles from every part of the Indian sub continent and Africa, were translated into at home style robes and comfort wear. They were worked in every fabric imaginable, but were especially suited as glamour dressing when sewn in exotic fabrics and edged in silver, gold or other metallic embroidered trims. Right - Kaftan pattern of 1971.    GOD BLESS DAWG
1ce0748c0ab23dcbbd0d889d57183122aa	I'm not Japanese, but I do know that the Japanese have very mixed feelings about foreigners. The word "Gaikokujin" is "foreigner", frequently shortened to "gaijin" (which turns the meaning to "outsider"). The Japanese live in a very homogenous society, and it's extremely hard for a foreigner to get citizenship. They do have a feeling of superiority, look up Nihonjinron (pretty much ideas that they have on why they are different and better than others- most are obviously not true, such as them being the only country with four seasons -_-). I think these thoughts are mostly about other Asians though.....    However, many Japanese are very very interested in meeting foreigners, will happily pose in pictures, eager to practice english and want to get to know you. You wouldn't be exactly shunned- what I'm trying to say is that they would never consider you Japanese even if you had a citizenship. They'd still like you as an individual though. It's mostly ignorance due to the lack of foreigners they've met, and what they've only seen through TV. Actually I heard the older generations are rather friendly towards foreigners. If you go up north towards Hokkaido I heard there's occasional trouble, due to some Russian and American troops that are stationed there that occasionally harass people, go to bars and misbehave, cause a ruckus, etc.     In general, you'd be treated well- as long as you ACT well and that goes in any country. Follow their etiquette, learn basic Japanese to show them that you'd like to make an effort, be friendly, and you'll be accepted very well in general. Of course there are xenophobic people but it's literally like that in EVERY country.

GVQRrZODaa	So why do christians think the verses regarding homosexuality still apply today?|`|5QI3I4C8aa	You gotta keep in mind that the Bible was written a LONG time ago, and some passages from it simply don't make sense in today's society. Of course he can go to church, he's a human being like any other and the fact he has difficulty walking doesn't take away his right to worship.|`|t88527U1aa	Read further we are no longer under the law, Jesus came put a end to levitical law we now under grace and mercy afforded at the cross,he would be welcome at any church I know of we have ramps have you been to church ever?  As in all books in the adult world we need to read all passages as we can say what ever we would like as the press does! When Jesus says this he is stating he is fullfillment of what was predicted,Jesus was the fullfillment of Gods promises. Read further as Jesus speakes of other laws is he affirming levitical law or preaching a New Testament? Matthew 5v21-48 Then look at Epistles,as in all reading read all applicable passages that way we don't look foolish and childish!|`|mCy1jIEvaa	This is not about attending church but about making offerings in the synagogue. It would have been in line with other things of that time regarding offerings to God having to be perfect and without blemish.     Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice, perfect and without blemish in the sense that He never sinned.    The coming of Jesus removed the curses mentioned in the Old Testament and, although we still have people born with 'blemishes' they are not seen now  as those in Old Testament times were seen (as being cursed, blemished, less than perfect etc. In Jesus' eyes all God's creation is perfect, it is man who sees imperfection and discriminates accordingly.    The only reason that I can see preventing someone in a wheelchair attending church would be the absence of a ramp into the church.    Wassup - The New Testament also has things to say about homosexuality. That is why those things still apply now. God still says that it is an abomination and says that such people (unless they repent) will not go to heaven.|`|eJMOGeRraa	Lev 21 is rules for priests. So is the rest of the book.  Leviticus was written for priests who would be "pastoring" over the newly built portable tent cathedral. The priests needed a how to guide on how to run the cathedral. So Moses wrote Leviticus for God. (Moses and Aaron were also Levities, descendands of Levi) The Israelites were just hanging out becuase they could not complete there journey  to the promise land until the priest manual was finished.God wanted them to have this law so that they would stop messing up and get to the promise land. He did not wanting them sinning anymore. That is the whole purpose of Leviticus, to show the priests how to run things to get the Isrealites to the promise land without anymore sinning.     Today.  Since the Isrealites have already reached the promised land, Leviticus simply shows the Isrealites journey. We are not bound by it's rules and regulations. This means that your friend is welcome in any church. Including mine. In fact we have several wheel chaired and mentally impaired and deaf people among our congregation.    *My own personal opinion on Lev 21:16-23 is that God didn't people running the show who might mess the others up. He did not want handicapped because the might have started complaing about things and turned the people into complaining and sin and yadda yadda.  But that is simply my opinion and not fact. Guess we can ask God about this when we get to heaven.    And good question. Star for you.    Edit- One more thing. Gays and homosexuality are also mentioned in the NEW testament. 1 Corinthians 6:9,18-20. Romans 1:25-30, and Hebrews 13:4. The law on that issue will never change. Sorry.    Edit- Your additional details lists Matt 5:17. Bravo. One problem, we are not going to the promise land. If we were in Bible times and headed there and eating mana and walking across a parted sea, than YES this (Lev) would apply. But we are NOT. It has already been done.  Most the old testmaent pretains to certain situations, and this is one of them.     Since were listing verses here, I'll give you my  one of my favorites- Rev. 3:11. Or maybe two. 1 Thess 5:16-18|`|cM4o0eAOaa	The verses you refer to had to do with the Levitical Priesthood that existed during the time the nation of Israel; which held the privilege to offer up animal sacrifices...  Also during that time all Israelites were to bring their offerings to the Temple which was a part of worship...no doubt many of these humans had imperfections..for many of the scriptures offered hope that there would be a time those who suffered from physical ailments and handicaps would no longer be ill...    An example...  Isaiah 35:6?At that time the lame one will climb up just as a stag does, and the tongue of the speechless one will cry out in gladness. For in the wilderness waters will have burst out, and torrents in the desert plain  also   Isaiah 33:24 . 24?And no resident will say: I am sick. The people that are dwelling in [the land] will be those pardoned for their error.    So these scriptures you referenced where specifically for those who bought the animal sacrifices into the most holy (the priests from the lineage of Aaron)...which represented the very throne of God...also it was to foreshadow what was to come...the Perfect sacrifice of Jesus as High Priest for our sins..If you notice also in verse 22..such a person was allowed to eat the bread of the most holy things but could not approach the altar..Also these animal sacrifices came from the people of the nation of Israel...  So what does this mean for us today? Today we are nolonger under the Mosaic law and there is no levitical priesthood. But as Christians we still bring our sacrifices to the spiritual altar through Jesus our perfect High Priest..    Heb 13:15 highlights this: 15.Through him let us always offer to God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of lips which make public declaration to his name. 16?Moreover, do not forget the doing of good and the sharing of things with others, for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.    Also, while Jesus did advocate the Mosaic Law, he did so he would fullfill the law...as stated in the scripture you mentioned. Today while we are nolonger under the Law many of the principles still apply and are beneficial. Such as the sacrifices mentioned above...of praise to our God and presenting such  to the alter through representation of Jesus.    Should you ever like...you and your friend are always welcome to the Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses  All the best!!|`|t79pLOCUaa	The Biblical verse applies only to the priests when making an offering.  Read the passage and you will see that the words are spoken to Moses to tell Aaron, who was the High Priest, and referred also to Aaron's descendants..  The words apply to no one else  In short your friend can go to church..|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	He has been freed from the law.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	That was the temple under the Law of Moses, which is done away in Christ.|`|HWoLbR7Aaa	Only if he's not gay.

Thanks for asking though.|`|AA11124121	he can go wherever he wants..    the key here is the "offerings to Jehovah"|`|fSlZQzS4aa	He could come to mine.|`|c1wCuGzpaa	whatever yes he can.|`|VFWRdAH3aa	yes. i'm in a wheelchair and i attend Church as often as possible.|`|tEn2nnsuaa	eww, why are you friends with a gimp?|`|uFymsQhQaa	yes he can God loves everyone|`|3DjUX8etaa	Yes, he can. The Old Testament laws of cleanliness(holiness) no longer apply. Jesus spent much of his time ministering to those that the Jewish law considered unworthy. God Bless!  +?+  Continued - Yes, Jesus did advocate keeping the law in most situations, but in this case it was different. The Old Testament belief was that if a man was crippled, as your friend sounds to be, it is punishment due to his sinful nature. So they believed that his sinful nature made him unclean(unholy). Jesus' purpose was to free us from the bondage of sin. That is the reason he was often criticized in the New Testament for associating with leapers, prostitutes and tax collectors. All of these people were considered sinful and unclean to the Jews.|`|VuIed11caa	as far as my understanding.. OF COURSE you can... GOD helps you with every problem you have and being in a wheelchair is a problem... It is ridiculous man, for someone to be in a wheelchair and think they can't go to church!

It has nothing to do with your crippled friend.  The Bible teaches that sin causes disease, affliction, etc.  A priest is to be free of sin because the "crown of the anointing oil of his God is upon him: I am the Lord.  And he shall take a wife in her virginity.  A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or a harlot, these shall he not take:  but he shall take a virgin of his own people to wife."  Lev. 21:12b-14|`|xyiIyZlEaa	If its in the bible then it must be true....|`|QWFvw2yvaa	What?  don't think just because he's disabled he can't go to church!  That's not a very good reason!

c9a1b864f1a97925067a5a7737860ac4aa	I am in agreement with the first answerer.  Peter was never a Pope.  The supremacy of the Roman bishop (the papacy) was created with the support of the Roman emperors. With the city of Rome being the center of government for the Roman empire, and with the Roman emperors living in Rome, the city of Rome rose to prominence in all facets of life. Constantine, and his successors, gave their support to the bishop of Rome as the supreme ruler of the church. Of course it is best for the unity of the Roman empire that the government and state religion be centered in the same location. While most other bishops (and Christians) resisted the idea of the Roman bishop being supreme, the Roman bishop eventually rose to supremacy, due to the power and influence of the Roman emperors. When the Roman empire collapsed, the popes took on the title that had previously belonged to the Roman emperors  Pontificus Maximus.|`|AA11124121	There were "Popes" in Peters' time? I must research this..but it doesn't sound sound. Seriously.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Korban, you can google the 7 dwarfs and find them too!|`|bXeHr69Vaa	and george washinton was not the 1st. president either , check it out|`|AA11440601	There are different kinds of spiritual gifts but the same Spirit;   there are different forms of service but the same Lord;   there are different workings but the same God   who produces all of them in everyone.   To each individual the manifestation of the Spirit is given for some benefit.   To one is given through the Spirit the expression of wisdom;   to another the expression of knowledge according to the same Spirit;   to another faith by the same Spirit;   to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit;   to another mighty deeds;   to another prophecy;   to another discernment of spirits;   to another varieties of tongues;   to another interpretation of tongues.   But one and the same Spirit produces all of these,   distributing them individually to each person as he wishes.   (1 Corinthians 12:4-11)    We do not know why the Holy Spirit selects one person for Pope over another. We just accept the Holy Spirit's choice.    John was just given different spiritual gifts.    With love in Christ.|`|PdaUxZMjaa	Of all the apostles, John was the youngest and the most innocent.  He was also the one who had suffered the least and been the least tempted.  In my three score and ten plus, I have known many Type B personalities who, in their personal walk with the Holy Spirit, have been tempted very little by Satan.  I am a walking sinner but my temptations have originated from within my own imagination and rationalisms.  Personally, I believe that this is a scholarly question and should be a answered by a detailed minded person rather than a creative generalist like me.|`|aV3bFchtaa	Catholicism adopted Peter as the first "Pope". Neither Peter nor GOD was involved in the adoption.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	John was Bishop of Ephesus and not of Rome and the Bishop of Rome would be the successor of Peter|`|FBrwlhPtaa	There weren't no Popes until the 3rd Century. Believe it or not Peter was NOT a Pope. Catholicism was started by Constantine in 325 AD.|`|FyLfEPv0aa	The entire idea of supremacy of the popes originated in the 5th century.    Constantine gave power to the church by recognizing them; yet he presided over Nicea because there were several Bishops but no leader.    Peter had no successor who was prominent in the gospel; Linus and Clement were honorable men but if you read their works, they didn't assume to be greater than the others.    There were many great men who lived and dies while serving in a position known as the "Bishop of Rome" who looking down from heaven centuries after their death found out that they had been popes rather than Bishops.|`|Z5KvRSRCaa	John didn't mention the weather outside either...

q5jF0iMhaa	Actually, most fetuses grow into babies, not babbies. Weird, I know, but true.|`|AA11008046	God is not dumb!  It cannot be.  God is onipotent and omniscient and thus cannot be dumb.  I don't remember how many question have been asked of late about God knowledge but all put forth in different manners.  the answer is the same for all.  God's kindness to give mankind a mind is the problem.  We use knowledge to do things against God's laws and then blame God.  We do all in our powers and I can point directly to the ACLU to disprove  and discredit God and all that this Christian country was built on.  Scientist do things to try to verify scientific theory.  some turns out good and some do not.  All babies no matter what the inception methodology will be born with brains, souls, etc.  Unfortunately some do not get past complete birth status, some will live for a bit and leave us.  None of this is God's fault.|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?  Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing?  Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing?  Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing?  Then why call him God? - Epicurus, 33 A.D.    "The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, unjust, unforgiving control-freak; a vindictive, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, pestilential, megalomaniacal, sadomasochistic, capriciously malevolent bully." - Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion|`|AA11989999	Souls do not begin to grow until age 21.

You'd think if God was omnipotent and omniscient he could see abortions etc coming and act accordingly.  But apparently it's all our fault, for making decisions with our minds.  Of course God gave us those minds, and created the concept of the mind to begin with, and created and runs the world that influences our minds, but no, it's not his fault at all.    We know nothing about God, period.

That's why I'm tolerant of everyone, no matter their orientation or religion.    People's private life should be just that: private. Why get into people's love lives, especially when you're not a part of it?    I'm not against homosexual relations. If that's who they love, then so be it.

Having a woman under false pretenses is wrong. And it angers me that they think it is ok to play with another person's emotions like that.     If you are honest about yourself I don't have a problem, but right now I am struggling with people who are not who they want people to think they are.    I hope this makes sense.|`|h81TOSULaa	Homophobia is based on religion. Over 60 years ago, in some Southern states, it was illegal for interracial couples to get married. People based this law on passages from the Old Testament. But then they realized how irrational the law was and it was abolished. I believe that in 10 years, gay marriage will be legal all over the US. We just need time.

3Bc4FoLdaa	It depends on what a person considers "healthy".  To us, as Christians, "healthy" thought and behavior centers around the Bible, the wisdom we get from the Holy Spirit.  For someone that doesn't believe in the Bible, whether not at all (atheists), or not 100% (JW's, Mormons, Muslims, some agnostics, etc), what is their guidebook for healthy?    It would have to be what comes from their own mind, and other human's minds (Socrates, Plato, Psycho-babble, Unitarian thoughts, etc) and what they feel/believe is right and wrong, and you know where I'm going with that.      It's interesting, when someone spews mocking and disrespect at the Christian faith, it shows ignorance of proportionate levels.   People like to point out the condemnation in the Bible, but fail to read the entire Bible themselves, and see the love of God that goes hand in hand with the judgment when mocking and disrespect occur.  And Jesus tells us as Christians to continue to love them, and tell them the good news.  Wow, that's a tough one sometimes... but onward we go :-)    It's good to know you're not fighting the good fight on your own, BK, there's lots of us here with you, lifting up your arms when they're too heavy to carry the sword.  True story :-)|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|AA11297267	It might be "healthier" to stay away from that kind of thought and behavior, just as it might be "healthier" for christians to learn some critical thinking skills, stop referring to their superstitions as "facts," and stop trying to make their superstitions into laws.      See, it goes both ways.    I won't concern myself with "disrespect," since ideas that are completely baseless and without evidence aren't worthy of anybody's respect.  Mocking, however...well, sure, it's not very helpful.  But let's be honest:  sometimes it's just the right response to some of the things posted here.  Me personally, I'm not trying to "convert" anybody, so I don't have much interest in soft-pedaling fact or worrying about somebody being offended, though I don't go out of my way to hurt anyone.  But you've got to admit that much of the nonsense posted here is so "out there" that mocking it is a reasonable response.  And if a little humor and criticism get some people thinking, then it might actually be a good thing.    If your ideas can't handle a little criticism and humor, then they aren't worth much.

"Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul."

God knows all whom are natural descendants.    There are many more Jews abroad as only part of the Jews have returned to Israel.    The 1967 victory fulfilled prophecies over centuries and even millenia.      The afct sare that God does the repatriation thing in His timing with helps of others.     The church ingrafting is the spiritual link of accepting Jesus as Saviour altering their destinies and lives to fulfill God's word.    As God is the vine and we are the branches we accept his high calling through Christ Jesus at God's acceptable time.   So not all called Israel is Israel.

Isa 49:18  "Lift up your eyes and look around; All of them gather together, they come to you.

Isa 49:19  "For your waste and desolate places, and your destroyed land-- Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants, And those who swallowed you will be far away.  Isa 49:20  "The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears, 'The place is too cramped for me; Make room for me that I may live here.'  Isa 49:21  "Then you will say in your heart, 'Who has begotten these for me, Since I have been bereaved of my children, And am barren, an exile and a wanderer? And who has reared these? Behold, I was left alone; From where did these come?'"  Isa 49:22  Thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, I will lift up My hand to the nations, And set up My standard to the peoples; And they will bring your sons in their bosom, And your daughters will be carried on their shoulders.  Isa 49:23  "And kings will be your guardians, And their princesses your nurses.

hYRP0x2Eaa	They can't kick you out, you're only 15. You have to tell someone. Maybe you could stay at a friends house until the heat cools down? Some times when my boyfriends parents threaten to kick him out, he stays at a friends house for a week. By the time he gets back, his parents have completely forgotten and miss him like crazy. Maybe you could try the same.     But from what you said, i think your dad might have convinced your mom about not allowing you to date the same gender. She was cool about it, but then all of a sudden she isn't? Sounds like your dad got to her. You need to get away for a week. They'll miss you, trust me.    By the way, as a long term goal you should consider moving out, or staying permanently with a family member. You don't want to hide yourself do you? It's not a way of life anymore. You probably are not financially stable right now, so make that a goal to work on. Don't quit school, just get an after school job. Good Luck xoxo|`|GEqyvwXAaa	fair? no. completely unfair. understandable... well it does happen. when you came out to your parents did they say any of this then, express any shock or reservation? if all they said was "oh, ok, we're glad you can talk to us"etc, then they were not being honest with you at the time. which is kind of sweet, it means they really wanted to do the right thing. unfortunately it also means they're messing with your head. you are very young, and they worry for you. but you need to have a more honest, calm conversation with them, once you've all cooled down. don't start the conversation angry, or it won't go anywhere.   side note: what's your girlfriend like. my dad started asking if i "bat for both teams" back when he really really hated the guy i was dating... is there some reason they might not like her specifically and be generalizing her into all gay women?|`|ZU2nlPGVaa	From now on, be quiet about your activities, because as long as you live under their roof, there's not much you can do. Don't egg them on, don't start arguments, in all likely hood you will lose.It sounds as though your mom might have been coerced and bullied, that's why they both turned on you. Give them time to think about what has transpired, and maybe they'll get used to it. Your girlfriend definitely needs to stay away. Just be cool and stay on the down low. Do you have a cell phone? That would certainly help, her not calling your house. Not normal? that's just a reaction,.....how old are your parents, that could be an influence too. When I first told my mother, she was scared family members would find out,......but then she came around. She may not have wanted that for me, but she didn't ***** and harp at me., but see honey, I was over the age of consent. What also helped, was my mom ended up liking my girlfirends a lot.

If you are gay that is fine but at age 15 you really don't know.

But the words they say were hurting = not fair. Parents have their own reasons when they react like this.    I have a girlfriend too. Young too, I am eighteen. My parents came to know about it. They hated the relationship we had. I am from an asian country, so its even worse. Parents are more narrow-minded. My girlfriend couldnt come over my place. And whatever your parents told me, they told me that too. All i did was cry and cry. Hurt that they called me abnormal and going against the religion (catholic, btw). But after a year, they are okay with my girlfriend and I.    The best is to give your parents time to accept. Dont do anything, best is not to argue with them. It makes them more pissed actually. Time will tell. They have to accept you for you are, but it wouldnt be totally.     I wish you all the best! (:|`|I0xO8IAHaa	No its not fair and i hope they know they can go to jail for kicking a minor on the street. Thats messed up they were ok with it at first then they should be ok with it know.

Many people in your position opt for going back into the closet and staying there until they can move out, it's not a good solution, but it's a solution.  As long as your parents consider themselves to be in a position of absolute power over you they have no reason to compromise or even listen, it's sad, but it's a fact of life.  Try talking to a school counselor or someone else you can trust and maybe they can help your parents understand that this is not something you chose or have any way to change, either way, I hope things work out, and good luck.|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	One thing about parents that we all have to understand is that it can take them awhile to get their heads around the concept when we tell them we prefer the same sex over the opposite sex. Parents aren't invulnerable to everything, and sometimes it is actually hard for us, as LGBT people, to really know that.    You need to sit down and talk with them. One thing you should really do is switch the points around gently, and ask them if they would say you were "too young" if you had brought a boyfriend home instead. Try to get them to understand that there is little difference if you bring someone of the same gender home, but try not be too aggressive about it.|`|AA11090251	Well no that's not fair of your parents.    If they don't want you dating or bringing your dates around the house at your age, that's understandable. But if it's not ok to be gay, then I'd say move out whenever you are financially responsible.    Show them the movie "Prayers for Bobby"
AyEkA6Flaa	Awww, both of you are so shy you have relied on your eyes alone to speak for you.  But in this case, words would be really helpful.  Because both of you are a little worried that the other one really isn't interested, but you also kind of know that each other are.    Take a deep breath.  Walk up to him and smile.  "Hey I'm Kaysi!  I remember that (name) introduced us last year but I never learned your name."  Wait for him to give his name.  "Well, (his name), you've always seemed like a really nice guy to me.  Would you ever be interested in (seeing a movie, going to a concert, attending a sport's event, coming to my house, getting some coffee with me?"    If you could find out from your other friend if this guy has hobbies or whatever, you could use that as an excuse to meet.    Anyway, he might say no.

	I have heard of MANY.  My partner and I, for instance, started out as a crush and have been living happily ever after for more than 7 years.  And I know dozens of couples who have been just as successful.    Now, that is not to say that I (and others) did not have many "unsuccessful" crushes before finding the right persons, but that is no different than the straights.    There were 11,000 same-sex couple wed in California in 2008.  10,385 same-sex couples were married in the first four years marriage was legal in Massachusetts. So, you can extrapolate from that that it is not at all uncommon for folks to live happily ever after, even if they are two guys or two gals.

My God is the God of the impossible.   There have been many idols and false gods in the world, but only one True and Faithful God and Lord of all.   Jehovah is our healer and our provider.  He is called Jehovah-Jihreh (our Provider), Jehovah-Nissi (The Lord Is My Banner), Jehovah-Saboath (The LORD of Hosts), and Jehovah-Shalom (the Lord our Peace) in Scripture.  He is our peace and rest. Nothing is impossible with Him.    Jonah and the whale  A little girl was talking to her teacher about whales.    The teacher said it was physically impossible for a whale to swallow a human because even though they were a very large mammal their throat was very small.    The little girl stated Jonah was swallowed by a whale.    The teacher reiterated a whale could not  swallow a human; it was impossible.    The little girl said, "When I get to heaven I will ask Jonah."    The teacher asked, "What if Jonah went to hell?"    The little girl replied, "Then you ask him."    gatita_63109|`|grwtwPbAaa	God doesn't expect us to all belief..he gave us free will for this pupose!  He wants us all to believe in him...but he gives us the choice!  God bless!  :)     Way to go Gatita!  Thumbs up!  God bless you !|`|E71jweytaa	are you telling me someone couldn't live in a whale for three days?      buddy people have lived in harsher climates for longer|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	The story of Jonah was a parable.   Jesus referenced it as a parable that His listeners would have been familar with, as part of their culture.    All God expects from us is for us to love one another the way Jesus taught us.|`|lAMdAKmzaa	Why is that hard to believe if you have faith?    It was a historical event.     If you had a time machine, you would actually see man being swallowed by a big fish and then being spit out 72 hours later.    This was a documented, historical fact.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You  show me where that is an article of Faith. I don't believe you. WHERE is the citation ?|`|IFQFt25naa	Actually the story might not be as impossible as many people think.      There is an interesting write up about this titled:    Could the story of Jonah have really happened?  Located at:  http://troach.org/faith/jonah.htm    Basically it goes though most of the aspects of the story to see if it is even remotely possible.  (size of animals, normal locations, digestive systems, etc)    The only real problem that had to be taken on faith was how did Jonah breath.  Unfortunately this is the spot where a little faith and a no proof assumption came into play.     Jonah 1:17 says in part:  Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow Jonah. . . .     The LORD prepared a great fish. How it was prepared is not stated. However, if we assume that the animal was made sick. Then we can also assume that the animal would not be digesting food properly and likely 'gasping' at the surface thus getting air into the stomach. The 'gasping', breaking the surface with its mouth open, is very important because air is not taken into the stomach via a whales normal airways.     Though it is a matter of faith as to if the events really happened or if the book of Jonah is just a story.     And I will even grant you that it is not likely for a sick whale to be just the right spot at just the right time.     The story does however seem, to be a lot more possible than most people think.    May Our Creator watch over you and your family.|`|AA11503457	Jesus seemed to believe it and he was/is more rational than any of us.|`|5O5d4H1Gaa	Why does a woman bleed for 5 days without dying?|`|oxdBlbezaa	exactly why would you not tell a more believable lie.

1cYPOJkqaa	It upset me when I first heard, but there's no point getting upset or angry, it won't change anything.
bMuwuAVOaa	Past-present-future...It is all one life, one long continuous life only accentuated by the events of physical birth and death. We are all many things in each life time. A child, a grown-up, a worker, mother/father etc...  Why would it be any different with the eternal life of the soul. Once being a farmer, or a ruler of a nation, or even just a pauper,  witch or scientist. Life is a beautiful and wondrous thing. Peace&Love be with you...~M~|`|1wNsBNmxaa	nope not at all i do not ever have any feeling about stuff like this ever    Relic66~~~?|`|e3gZsCsgaa	Yeah.  I felt like I was some kind of medicine woman from the old ages and was a very well respected person too. I always found remedies on how to stay healthy when it comes to the mental health and ways to elude stress and anger.I also felt that this medicine woman was highly intuitive and somewhat spiritual in a way.|`|294e1701917b0ab03a81e21b3d809bd2aa	yeah, there's places and ppl that will seem strangly familiar , like i been 2 the places or knew the person before, even tho we just met. like a deja vu  feeling.|`|l3EVUl91aa	i'l give you one guess lol    many different phychics have told me i'm an old soul and have had many different lives, over the years i researched, read and have had a few regressions i have discovered some of my past lives.  peasant woman (french)  also 'witch'  english countess  soldier world war 2 (shot in a trench)  american male in 50s 60s died possibly 70s   lots of native american past lives male and female, my soul belongs here.  and the latest one i had last week which was really interesting, when i went into the regression i wanted to bring up my life as a lakota girl, i was slain horribly by a soldier and feel the regression left open wounds.  so anyway i went in looking for that life and found myself as an egyptian woman, i was looking over a desert then i turned and walked into a somekind of temple, the year was 1032bc.|`|Tjr9aObNaa	Yes i had a dreamset in the 1930's/40's i think where i was dating a lad and was sleeping with his father, and we had 'relations' in his car hidden behind some bushes...very strange. And i have had feelings of familiarilty when i visit new places where i have never been before. I definately believe in this, there was a story of a young girl born in a rural indan village speaking a strange dialect from a young age. Her parents just thought it was baby speak until a family friend who spoke it was visiting and realised it was a language and understood it. The little girl was saying she didnt know why she was with this family and kept asking after her husband etc. Anyway, the family took her to the village where the dialect was spoken and found out that there was a widower who's wife died the same day the little girl was born...and the same name...very strange! I believe this, i was told it in RS in High School 7 years ago :)|`|7jM9Ghchaa	yes that you go some where and you have never been there but you know you have walked down that street knew the shop or that feeling?|`|2aa7f3581ca7a75ce4b41ed0be249da6aa	This may sound ridiculous but I believe somehow I used to live back in the 1940's or 50's. I find myself unnaturally drawn to old movies and music. and I get a strange feeling when I listen to or watch them. The feeling of...like...I don't know like I MISS it for some reason...like my past life is trying to get out. I'm not crazy by any means but that's how I feel.    **My Grandmother SWEARS she was a Cheetah in her past life...she's sane too...believe it or not!|`|V5MfJWo4aa	No, i haven't yet.  But my best friend had this dream +  when she was like 3 years old or something, she started talking (not good though, like 10 words maximum) and then one day she begun speaking full sentences, she told her parents about her past life that moment, that she lived in a trailer in Texas, that her mother was a fat Afro-American and her father a Caucasian and that she died on her couch. And in that dream she saw it all repeating (her parents told her about it).      I only get like flashes of people i don't know or have never seen in my head. Once i had a flash and i'm sure it was me, but different... So maybe that was me in a previous life, or something like that.    You know, you can get hypnotyzed for that,  (my best friend's mom can do that)  so they hypnotyze you, and you "see" all your previous lives...  You "see" how you die and who you were.  But because you think it's happening on that moment to you, you're very afraid... But when you wake up again you're not afraid anymore. You can get in shock too.  My best friend's mom let it do to her by other psychics and once she was a princess, she died rolling off a hill into the ocean.|`|QqOUVukfaa	I think every1 has passed life's, only I can't remember mine as this one has gone on for sooo long...  I was born in 2000bc... so you can see my problem, i just cant think that far back.  =k|`|AA10844779	Only once I had that feeling, and it was the first time I visited Sligo in Ireland. It felt like coming home but I had never been there before. Also, it would explain my passion for all things Irish long before I had ever been there. I always tell people I'm Belgian by birth but Irish by heart, and at one point I used to think that maybe in a past life I was Irish. It sure would explain a lot, but other than that I don't know...|`|32la4VGEaa	yes|`|IAkEyPb9aa	No I don't.    I keep hearing about all these people regressing and telling of their pasrt lives. Far too many are alegedly of noble birth and were royalty or whatever. Just how many bloody princes and princesses were there!!|`|AA10211580	Past life  1. I had a past life in Italy because for 2 years I had a strange homesickness feeling for that country when I've never even been there in my current life. Anything that had to do with italy, even italian wines and foods, I would get emotional for some reason. The feeling subsided overtime.    Past life  2. I can't go near statues- big or small. I get freaked out. I don't know if I had died near one. I didn't get into that. I heard on a psychic show of woman of a similar situation like that she also can't go near statues and in her past life regression, she was hung near one in a past life.    Past life  3. I had some vague visions of me being buried alive. I was male in that life. I was convicted of a crime I didn't commit. the cops or authorities beat me up until I was unconscious and buried me alive in a an alcohol crate. When I awoke in the coffin, I tried to desperately to get out and I ended up dying of dehydration, lack of oxygen and stroke. That's why in my present life I don't like closed spaces and I have breathing problems. I felt that this was in a bootleg era. I fell in love with a prostitute. I had a happy life as a farmer and I supported my family. I was a young man who died before his time.    Past life  4. I had a past life with my ex-boyfriend (in this life) during the medieval era. We were also lovers back then. Our families were enemies. I was also pregnant with our illegitimate child. One day he had to go to battle. He promised me he would return and he never did. He died during battle. In this life, our families were also against us being with each other. My boyfriend in this life made promises that he couldn't keep. He left me again in this life. I don't know what our learning experience is besides him making promises to me that he couldn't keep.    Past life  5: one of my other past lives, I was a tribal person during a past life regression. I had makeup on my face and very little clothing. I can't tell if I was male/female. In this life, I love feeling liberated and I learned not to take crap from anybody.    That's all I got.|`|leU4QY9iaa	Yeah.  I think i was a cat like animal.  I'm quite aggressive and i scratch =/  My ears also move if there is a unexpected noise or a loud one :)  wow, I'm a freak xD|`|w5OawaG5aa	My girlfriend hates seeing executions in films so reckons she may have been executed in a previous life. Personally I feel drawn to the sea, but that probably doesn't indicate a past life as surely everyone who goes sailing feels that and it's unlikely they keep coming back to new lives and go sailing again.|`|rZhx3Nwuaa	Yes I do, and I believe in reincarnation just like a lot of my friends, and it is a fascination subject.  Your Spirit cannot die, it is indestructible and it goes on for evermore.

Sometimes I have mixed up dreams that seem like a puzzle. My Deja vu gets really annoying sometimes, they end up being changed by how I act and what I do. Maybe dreams are memories from our past life, who knows?|`|KclUG2dmaa	i sometimes feel like ive had deja vu on many occasions before|`|llPWNGNtaa	Lately I get this feeling a lot. I will smell something or see something and it is something that reminds me. But I never know of exactly what it reminds me of. Sometimes I just feel like I have been through so much when I have not. I strongly believe on past lives. And I know Ive had them. It's something I can't even put into words it's just this feeling I get. It's very strange, but extremely interesting at the same time.|`|yKLBdoigaa	Yes, I get that feeling. In fact, I just got it today while I was sitting in my music class. It was something in the music we were listening to that just all of a sudden triggered a spine chilling goosebumps, "I've heard this before..."*flash of the idea I had a past life occurs* It's actually how I found your question just now, googling, "feeling of past life" brings this on the front page. Kinda of surprising there isn't that much material on past lives, especially when one looks at how many responses you've gotten.    While I have no specific details as to what my past life was, I just have a strong connection that this is not the first time I've lived on this earth. It's hard to explain, but I'm sure you understand it cause you feel the same way. My mother and I use to say to each other that, even when I was very young that we thought we each died in a different way, which reflects out current fear of choking and drowning.    Also as another person mentioned, Deja vu is a common occurrence. While I can easily discredit most Deja vu's I get as being able to picture or remember myself being a similar environment and/or situation, there are always some that make me wonder how I knew something was going to be this way, or how I just KNOW I've done/see this before.    I'm not religious, I rarely drink and don't do drugs, I'm a college student and I don't have any known mental disorders. But it makes me feel crazy saying to people that I think I've has a past life. It's completely true though, and I cannot deny it anymore really. I'm glad you posted this question, as I can see were definitely not the only ones.
LOSfacl5aa	Congratulations!    Whether or not to be with him is up to you. How comfortable are you? I am so uncomfortable with my body that I have decided to do nothing until I am Post-op. But it is going to take a long time. Do you want to wait that long? As long as the two of you are comfortable with each other it is fine to be with him.|`|d5zEYomEaa	If you love each other and are comfortable on an emotional and spiritual level then why would you have to wait for a physical change in order to please each other? Sorry but I don't get that. You will still be you even if you change your arm or boob or penis or whatever you're getting done. Don't be so picky on the physical if you love each other you should please each other now. But I'm obviously coming from a woman's perspective because men are so visual that I can't relate to what you are talking about.

Beware that if you are only pleasing him, it might wear on you after a bit. Also you could think of ways that would make you feel more female while being intimate. I'm a tranny boy myself, an wearing a strap on would make me feel more masculine during intimacy, where as before, it was too depressing.

An idea for the video is to put in a picture or clip of him and be like, "Wow! Who is that pretty guy? I wish he was my boyfriend! Oh wait, he is :D" and show a few pictures of you guys together and happy. At the end you can also say what joy he brings to your life and how fun he is to be with and around. Okay, that sounds cheesy. But you get the idea.    You can include his favorite songs or "your songs" in the background.    And along with the video, you could also give him a little gift that shows how much you like him. You can make him his favorite dish and add a touch of your own, maybe by making it into a heart                            or  Make something tht represents you two or how you met.

I have No Idea, but I am pretty sure its still kind of dangerous since there are a lot of Iraqis HATE americans occupying their country after they have lost their country and lives because America has destroyed their nation. Also, the Al Queda is still trying to fight Americans in that country becuase they simply want them out, but then Iraq would be a terrorist country since there is no stable leader, that is why we are still there.    To answer your question, the risk of dieing there from a bomb is decreasing, but wait until Obama gets all Americans out of Iraq and let that Kurdish Jerk take control, then probably it would be safe, as it was under Saddam Hussein.    I honestly believe Iraq was better off with Saddam Hussein since it was more stable and peaceful and since so many people disagree with me here, this answer would be a bad answer with multiple low ratings.|`|a955299a310a71175625cded5cea1a76aa	Well because of the lack of a unified government, and the divided population.

9ZwFQadRaa	Some people are really confused and think that baptism can save you from going to hell. Not true. Baptism is an act of obedience to Christ when you become a Christian. The correct order is- 1. Believe in Jesus, 2. Accept that He died to pay for your sins, 3. Ask Him to be your Lord, your King and your Savior, 4. Repent and turn away from sin, and 5. Get baptized. Without Belief, Acceptance, and Repentance, baptism is nothing more than getting wet at church. A baby can't do these things.|`|wRBfUgI2aa	It was a way for the clergy to get extra money from the people.    What is baptism?  The open symbol of dedicating your life to the service of God.  How could a baby possibly make such a decision?  Not possible.    Under Mosaic Law, the Jews were commanded to circumcise infants on the 8th day after birth to show they were part of God's Chosen People.  The fact that clotting agents in the baby's body were greatest on that day was not known to them.  Neither were all the health benefits for the time and conditions of their lives then.    This was the only requirement laid upon infants under God's Laws then or now.    False religion however, had many things for infants.  Jeremiah shows they burned their babies in sacrifice to idols.  This was something God never even thought of as Jere. 7:31 shows.    History shows pagans drowned them as well.  So when hypocritical clergies today "dunked" or "sprinkled" babies, one could say that was a step kinder.  However, it is not a Bible based practice.|`|D6yEjfciaa	when a baby is sick does the parent take the baby to the doctor, or  does the parent wait untill the baby asks will you take me to the doctor, of course the parent takes the baby to thr doctor.    that is why we baptise our baby becuase we are being good parents.we know what is best for our baby.|`|YVHwpPGWaa	It was the earliest practice of the church to baptize whole families, babies and all.  It was analogous to circumcision as practiced in Judaism.  Only later did some groups decide to postpone baptism.    The churches that trace their history and practice to the first century, such as Orthodoxy and Catholicism, practice infant baptism.|`|Hz2L59BCaa	They switched to baby baptism cause the pastors were getting aroused baptizing people in their teens, especially cute girls wearing wet tee shirts.

In my opinion, that is the best way.|`|AA12194228	The RC and Episcopal both baptize babies.    They do not confirm until "the age of reason", and after taking catechism classes, 10 to 12 or so.|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Some baptise infants, based on the promises of the parents, claiming for them the benefits of the Covenant and promising that they will bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord such that they shall own, for themselves, the promises made on their behalf ... that they shall accept God's Salvation  and that they will CONFIRM the promises which their parents had made for then.    Others believe that baptism should be administered only to those who are able to make, for themselves, a credible profession of their faith.|`|VmGcNErkaa	well Catholic Priests like their Little choir Boys Clean... if you get my drift...|`|PB2ucgrCaa	Different religions have different beliefs ,study the religions that do it both ways and then compare.|`|O3k4t0i9aa	Hm. Well I've never heard of infant confirmation, but I do know that infant baptisms stem from the ancient belief that an unbaptized infant will go to Hell if they die, so many in ancient and medieval times were baptized immediately after birth, or shortly thereafter, as infant deaths were so common. Today it's mostly just a tradition that many Christians still carry. I know that the Catholic and Lutheran churches do infant baptism; I'm not sure about any others.|`|kTYw3LgYaa	In the Catholic faith, a baby is baptized to wash away the original sin placed on all humans from when Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit. The baptism also serves as a way to welcome the child into the world and into the faith. Around age 16 they have a confirmation.  This is when the individual chooses as an adult to confirm their believe in the church.|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Those churches do not follow the true Word of God and are practicing a man made doctrine claiming it to be of God when it is not.    Mark 13:22 For false Christs and false prophets shall rise, and shall shew signs and wonders, to seduce, if it were possible, even the elect. .    2 Peter 2:1 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.    They are guilty of this...    Revelation 22:18-19  For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:     19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book.

The difference between ghosts and evil spirits is that ghosts are just apparitions of the dead, whereas evil spirits are not, and never have been, human. Rather, they are of the same nature as angels but, unlike angels, are in rebellion against God.    Usually ghosts appear because a person who has died is not yet at peace and is seeking help. The best way to respond if you see or sense one is to pray for them, that God will have mercy on them and bring them to rest. You can use any prayer you like, but one of the traditional ones is the 'Eternal Rest'.    "Eternal rest, grant unto them O Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them. May they rest in peace.     May their soul, and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen"|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	do Nothing and do not even think aboutit!

Leave the light on when you sleep that may help, but ultimately as you get older you will put aside these thoughts. Because the reality is there are no ghosts regardless of how often TV shows and others suggest there are. Have you heard of Houdini ? If not check him out on the internet. He spent his life uncovering fake spirits and mediums. Good luck and pleasant dreams.   P.S. and  finally stop watching shows that give you the creeps

So to be in heaven and not hell, believe the truth about Jesus now!    Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation.     The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|eJMOGeRraa	Ask God when you get there.

7kJFmyxdaa	Well look at it this way. Her father was reading the Bible the 10 Commandments which says  you should not steal." This was his way of reinforcing to her that stealing is wrong and you will be punished for it. Second he spanked her to let her know what she did was not right and therefore must be punished. I believe he is teaching her a valuable lesson. I commend him on going to scripture first and then the punishment. More parents should do this and they would not have out of control children on their hands.|`|AA11690436	A little trouble with line drawing?  Is what is appropriate at eight still appropriate at twelve?  Was the father angry in administering the spanking?  Did it leave any welts or marks on the child?  Bare bottomed or clothed?  And do any of those questions really matter?  We all have to draw our own lines.  A swat to get some child's attention is hardly the same as a formal spanking, but then what my folks called "pouch on touchas" was done in fun, horse play, and affection far more than it was done for discipline.  Discipline for me was usually a statement of my father's disappointment in me and a silent treatment for a period of time.|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	Pot calling kettle black|`|J7KSKm54aa	Spare the rod- spoil the child|`|V8qVsKhRaa	Well, y'know she isn't gonna steal again.

I agree with you, it made me uncomfortable just reading about it.    I didn't spank my kids, and they turned out fine.

65QqZBnjaa	You are confused.    The person with a twin inside them is NOT transgender or transsexual.    Bree, the main character in "TransAmerica" is a transsexual women who at the end of the movie gets her sex reassignment sugery.    The person you saw on Oprah is Thomas Beatty.  He is a transsexual man.    Transsexual people are BORN that way.  It is a brain-body mismatch.  Most of these people later transition to be the person they feel themselves to be.  The process of transition is long and expensive.

Whether they feel male or female is how they are naturally. Its not like they got up one day and said ohh I want to be a woman and grow breast and be interested in men or the other way around it how they feel inside its first nature to them and no one should take their right to be themselves away from them.|`|GEqyvwXAaa	april, it depends a lot on biology. the first case doesn't really seem to relate, as it sounds like you're talking about a vestigial twin.  some people are born intersex, with genitals that are either unclear or have both male and female aspects. often, these people are given surgery as infants to assign them a sex so they can grow up "normal." usually they are made into women because the surgery's easier. but hormones later in life can mess with that image. intersex people often have the same problem as many transgendered or transsexual people, gender dysphoria.  the sense of being "in the wrong body" is affected by psychology and biology. there is a growing body of evidence to show that the chemical and hormonal environment while the fetus is still in the womb has an enormous effect on a person's self-identified gender. this in turn is cause by genetic variation in the fetus's DNA.  as for Transamerica and Thomas Beattie, the pregnant man on Oprah,  often times, people cannot afford to or choose not to get complete gender reassignment surgery. creating a penis out of nothing, or a vagina out of a penis, is difficult and expensive. in Beattie's case it worked out well, as his wife could not have children. but it has led to a lot of problems, including brutal rapes and beatings, especially for male-to-female transgendered people.  hope this helped!|`|AA12355197	Intersexed and Transgender are two different things.

I suggest you say something like 'I need those books back that I lent you because _________________ (insert step dads name) has asked to borrow them to read and I don't want him to know I lent them to you'.The truth is always better and although people may not like to hear it they get over it quicker than they do if they discover they've been lied to.

Particles ? Who created the particles ? I can keep going on and on.  Answer : Humans are not real since there is no evidence of their evolution.  Would you accept the above argument. ?  If I tell you Who Created God, then you would say Who created the one who created God and it would go on and on.  We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.    In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|acbqsZZbaa	From your "argument" I take it you mean young-earth creationism.

I could be wrong if you'd like to list where you got this info from.    Then your not understanding how something falls into orbit. your are right that the sun pulls everything towards it but the satellites have two vectors. a horizontal vector and vertical vector, so the planets aren't really falling to the sun but falling around the sun.    Unfortunately for you I'm not going to go into an entire evolutionary lecture on Y!A but if you wish to email me I'd be more than happy to continue this further. And as for your "if humans evolved from apes why are there still apes?" question, You're seeing evolution as a latter with a goal in mind however this isn't what evolution states. a million or so years ago gorilla, chimps, and other apes didn't exist. They evolved at the same time and with humans. This question is about as effective as asking "if birds evolved from reptiles then why are there still reptiles?"|`|xZBwnrGzaa	I am not an Athiest, but I can see where they are coming from. They might not be able to disprove Creationism, but you can't disprove the Big Bang or Evolution. Do you wanna know what I say? Why couldn't God have created Evolution? Duh.|`|CKieDvu1aa	Yes Atheists, please do I'm ready for a good debate. Do it I dare you.|`|f79a4e31211ec881cdd7df7de85a9262aa	until you have evidence to prove there is nothing TO disprove.    that goes for you too Frenchchick. you first have to present evidence that supports your claim before other people can really disprove it.    if you want to then email me and we can debate if you are really up for it.    "An old man who failed Middle School and went to the Galapagos with a book on the theory of uniformitarianism for a week or two and came up with a theory to explain the entire origin of life."    actually no, his theory does not explain the origin of life, it explains the diversity of life.    "His theory involves the belief that the universe was created over 64 million years ago."    actually no, his theory involves biology, not astrophysics.  and the big bang occurred around 14 billion years ago.  64 million years ago was the extinction of the dinosaurs.    "If that was true then the Sun would've had to be as far away as it is from Saturn for it to be as close as it is now, which would have stopped life from beginning--too cold."    this is just nonsense.    and Charles Darwin was not the first to propose the theory of evolution.  many people prior to him also thought life developed from less complex to more complex organisms.  Darwin proposed the mechanism by which evolution occurs.  and he also spent around 30 years doing research before actually publishing his book "the origin of species"    Edit:  where do you get this "the sun is pulling us closer" crap?  along with the force of gravity the earth has a tangential velocity that keeps it from being pulled into the sun.  is the moon being pulled into the earth by the earths gravity?  your understanding of simple physics is lacking.    and all of our systems didnt "just happen".  your understanding of evolutionary theory is also lacking.  Mutation and Natural Selection are two major factors in evolution.  mutation being random, natural SELECTION being not random (hence the term selection).    and other apes did evolve.  its why we have chimps and gorillas and orangutans.  we did not evolve from chimps, we evolved from a common ancestor.|`|355JLlcLaa	No need.

Edit- Darwin spent months on continues visits to the Isles, and other parts of the Earth. Darwin was still younger then an elder when he maid his voyages on the S.S. Beagle, if you haven't paid any attention in Science 101 your Freshmen year of High School! he did go with a book on a Theory, he wrote the Theory, you obviously didn't pay attention to your Pre-Shcool teacher to know what a Theory is. the book is called 'the Origins of Species' it wasn't talking about how life began, you would want to look at your Geo Sciences to look at how life started here on Earth with Algae being the first signs of life. His Theory was about how beasts came to adapt to new climates, enviorenment, etc., not the Big-Bang you dolt!

ADDDED  QUOTE FROM ABOVE POSTER-  "We know God is real, since we are real. If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God."    quite frankly, that's a ridiculous statement to make. you have as much physical evidence of a god existing as a child who still believes in father christmas. just because we think something is real,doesn't mean it is! (obviously!)    why can i not deny there is a supernatural force involved?? just because there are things in this world that our tiny human brains cannot comprehend or make sense of, why do we therefore have to put it down to supernatural activity?     our brains have advanced to the point that we naturally question and try to make sense of our surroundings and origins and anything we may not understand. it is only those who are fed up of trying to question this that put it down to a higher being.. but i cannot therefore make sense of these people's logic for i would forever question that higher beings' creation. an answer to this is never provided.|`|1Te4sfqIaa	You only ask that question because creationism can not be disproved without disproving the existence of god.  This will not happen.      What we can say about creationism is that it serves no useful scientific purpose because it does not have a mechanism and can not be used to make any predictions about the kinds of organisms/traits that we can and cant expect to see.  This is because it predicts that god can create virtually any kind of organism he wants so anything is possible.      Evolution on the other hand has a mechanism in that the needs of the environment favor certain characteristics so creatures with those characteristics will emerge as dominant.  And it also allows us to make predictions on what we can expect to see in organisms that have been tested and are accurate.      I'll propose an analogy.  Lets say that I have a theory that says that if a rocket fires its engines it will move in some direction.  You would look at that and say "great what use is that to me?  How fast will it move?  What direction will it go in?"      The same is true of creation.  Okay so we can expect to see any kind of creature imaginable in the fossile record according to creation.  But how does it explain the obvious connections between animals and traits as they have become more complex.      Evolution does it.  Creationism simply says that anything is possible, therefore as a scientific theory, it is useless.    As a religious belief it is perfectly fine.

e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	I asked this before because it always puzzled me too.    Most of the people who answered my question said that they thought dancing was "too physical," or tempted people to lust and sexual sin.    I still don't agree with them, but many Christians, esp. more "blind faith" protestants, seem to believe this.|`|J7KSKm54aa	Pastafarians, coz of the noodly appendage thing|`|TyRfv0eoaa	In some faiths, dancing is seen as a form of worship (as indicated in the Psalms, like Ps. 150).

They believe it is sexual. Edit This  atheist thinks dancing is a: totally clean and b: sexual! Grins.|`|AA10105819	This depends upon what "dancing" means. Some religious groups are okay with dancing in general, as long as it's not vulgar. Some groups are okay with dance only used in worship. Some groups are opposed to all dancing.    I am fine with dance, as long as it's "clean." Although I'm not an expert, to my knowledge, my religion - the Baha'i Faith - has not made an official statement on the subject. It just teaches that we're supposed to live complete chaste lives, and to clean one's mind/being of merely base existence. Thank Goodness, 'cause I LOVE dance! Common sense tells you that bumpin' & grindin' isn't what one would consider "clean," but as long as the dance doesn't get sexual, then it's fine.|`|Hz2L59BCaa	I think it's the Baptists.|`|M7r8oaUzaa	christianity but like in the 30's at least in the southern states|`|Ium0qE5paa	Islam,to avoid fitnah|`|bd4315af2a7948203f4a1fd236c3449eaa	praise the Lord in the dance.|`|rQ5GI7d9aa	christianity it temps people but you ca dance like at a quinceanera but only the balce|`|r3xWSswtaa	Islam, there prophet has basically said that we/ their Women are scum beneath mens feet.

While it was still playing she drove up to my house and wanted to borrow my good coat for a Date she had later that night. Then a few days later my friends Sharon, Patty and I were listening to the radio and the song came on again, (We had again been talking about my sister). So we both laughed and Sharon and I started telling Patty what had happened just a few days earlier. Just then my sister pulled her Big Yellow "74" T-Bird up to the front of my house.

N9VN9bwfaa	Although Ares was the Greek god of war and was always fighting, he is not especially famous for killing.  He was the son of Zeus and Hera and fought on the side of the Trojans in Homer's "Iliad."  He wore armor and a bronze helmet, carried a shield, a spear, and a sword, and had chariot on occasion, though he more often fought on foot.  In that Trojan war I was telling you about, he went up against an ordinary mortal named Diomedes.  But the mortal got the better of him and wounded him.  As was typical in stories of this nature, once he was hit, Ares screamed a lot and left the battlefield to nurse his boo-boo.  Zeus had him fixed up, poor widdle baby.  On another occasion in the same war, the goddess Athena bonked him on the noggin with a big rock, stunning him.  So he doesn't come off looking too heroic in this story.  In stories about Herakles (or to use the Roman spelling, Hercules), he doesn't seem any better.  Ares defends his son Kyknos against the big hero, but Herkles wounds the god in the thigh (with a little help from Athena).  Ares once again screams a lot and runs off to Mount Olympos for the ancient Greek equivalent of Band-Aids.  This was actually his second loss to Herakles, since the hero had earlier beat him at Pylos -- in fact Herakles had even taken his weapons away!    Toward the end of the Trojan war, in a part that wasn't in Homer's story, Achilles is about to kill the queen of the Amazons, Penthesilea, and Ares wants to rush in and save her since she's his daughter.  But Zeus stops him with a thunderbolt (or lightning, which is the same thing).    Another story has Ares clobbered by some folks called the Aloadae who imprison him in a big bronze jar and keep him in there for 13 months.  This was my personal favorite because he's chained up in there screaming and crying heroically the whole time.  I thought that was hilarious.    Evidently the Greeks thought a lot of old Ares since his name is related to their word arete which meant excellence or glory or fame (depending on which dictionary you use).  He supposedly lived in Thrace (north of Greece) but he was worshipped on the Areopagus, a hill in Athens, the meeting place of the court where religious crimes were tried.    Other stories about Ares were more romantic and he was supposedly the father of a lot of demigods by mortal ladies -- most badly behaved boys who attacked travelers.  By Miss Pyrene he had 3 lads: Cycnus, Diomedes (a different one from the fellow who wounded him at Troy) and this guy had some ferocious man-eating horses, plus Lycaon.  He also had a hero named Meleager who was killed by a wild pig.  Dryas was another naughty son.  Oenomaus was still another badly behaved boy who grew up to kill all of his daughter's suitors with weapons which he obtained from dear, old, badly behaved dad.    But Ares' most famous lover was Aphrodite, who was actually married to somebody else, namely Hephaistos.  So Ares was always causing trouble.  But I haven't found the name of a single person or deity or giant whom he actually managed to kill!  What a maroon!    By the way, at Rome they identified him with their god of war who was named Mars (Martes in the genitive).  But Mars was only a part-time war god.  The other part of the time, he was a god of agriculture.|`|b6cd9d6fe5a0ec1d495444c45c2b75f2aa	Yea, he was in the Trojan war. He sided with the Trojans because Aphrodite was on their side, and he pretty much followed her lead.

28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Considering how often the so-called "pro-life" people turn their backs and walk away after that fetus they "saved" is born, that's a good question.     They aren't ''pro-life'' so much as they're ''pro-BIRTH." They love to call that fathead Rush Limbaugh and the Nazis of Fox News and complain about "unwed welfare mothers." They elect presidents who cut funding for children's health care, food programs, education and medical research.     And the pro-life movement is dominated by men and post-menopausal women. Why are they even involved? The sanctimony is really getting old. I just hope Obama succeeds in turning off their microphones.    As we like to say: If you're pre-born, you're worshiped. If you're pre-school, you're screwed.    In the immortal words of George Carlin: Ever notice the people screaming loudest about abortion are the people no one wants to [have sex with] anyway?|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	The Pro-Lifers also support religious warfare and the death penalty, not to mention bombing planned parenthood centers.  They also maintain that if everyone simply acted the way they want them so to do there would be no rape or any other kind of crime, this justifies killing anyone who disagrees with them since it will let them have their own way all the time.  All this is obvious from their actions, do be sensible, woman.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	I'm all of those.    I'm pro ALL life.

I never claimed a rape victim shouldn't consider an abortion.     I have no idea what "raping a chicken" is.    The tu quoque fallacy is weaksauce, by the way.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Many are for the death penalty. I have even seen some people here saying a woman that had an abortion should be put to death for "murdering" her unborn child.    Many don't care about the kid after it is born. Often times they have the attitude that it is the woman's fault for getting pregnant and she can raise it or put it up for adoption. Same even see it as a punishment and they deserve all the misery for being promiscuous.    Some are more reasonable, and just would like to see it as a very very last resort, and they push for proper education and support. I respect that, though I think the choice should always be there. The loudest ones are the religious nuttos that scream about murder but support abstinence only education and don't care about real babies.|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	No they dont care about the new born; the child is SOL.

9HOTbRxiaa	Grow up, you should be lucky you can afford to live in a safe neighborhood. I know plenty of people who live in those "'hoods" you desire to live in. Just the other day 13 people, just hanging out, were shot at. 9 people died, including one of the "bad boys" my friend had dated; took a bullet to the face.    So be my guest, when you turn 18, feel free to move into a neighborhood where you can't walk your dog once it gets dark and every guy you pass treats you like a whore.    You don't know what the "'hood" is like; if you did you would realize the people only live there because they're too poor to live where you do now.|`|a1efb39ce972b6f3dc75c44b815f368daa	When I was 16 I hated money and nice things.  I wanted to be poor and use to hang out with hippies.  I hated money and did not want to have anything to do with it.  I thought it was so evil.  I dated all kinds of hippie and band member boys.  But my reasoning was because I was raised by live in maids and nannies and never saw my parents.  You know typical silver spoon child kind of thing.  Now that I am older and understand parents having to work, etc. etc. etc. I feel different.    You will grow out of it.  When you get older you may not be able to afford a nice neighborhood like you are stating.  You might be looking back and remembering how you wanted to live in the ghetto and do live in the ghetto and then wishing you could live in a nicer, safer, quieter, non-drama neighborhood.|`|XNo8YGyfaa	You are crazy and naive.|`|36UDdHFzaa	lol that's funny. all girls at one point in their lives are attracted to bad guys but honestly you are wasting your time. i'm 22 now but i've chased bad guys myself back in the day and all they were was TROUBLE! they lie, cheat, steal, manipulate, and are selfish. not to mention don't really ever get out of that phase of being a bad boy. it's their "identity" perse and it's hard to loose that image so even after 20 they are still the "bad guys". honestly when you hit your 20's you realize what's most important in life and at that point you realize a bad guy isn't something you want to have around b/c all you'll have to do is pick up his messes and babysit him. leave them alone and you are young so focus on being young. this is your time to develop yourself into a great person... not saying you can't do it after but you are learning a lot right now on how to be a young lady, how to fit into society, how to be productive and successful. if you focus all your attention on boys and even a bad boy at that you won't have much tiem to focus on what really matters right now becoming a successful being. so take sometime to think about it and where you would like to see yourself in 10 years.... with a college degree starting a great new career or working a dead end minimum wage job living with your broke @ss bad boy? good luck.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	As soon as I read you were 13, that's where I realized you are just immature and can't appreciate peace and quiet.

Bad has nothing to do with economy, it has to do with the spirit of the person. Bad means lying, stealing, drug dealing, hurting other people to get what you want. Is that the kind of life you dream of? Because it isn't glamorous to be in prison, its humiliating and embarrassing. You have better to do with your life, which is why your folks are raising you where they are.

dDMOJWxwaa	Many psalms prophesy of Christs mission as the Messiah. The resurrected Savior declared, All things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me (Luke 24:44). Discuss the fulfillment of a few of the following prophecies about Christ that are written in the book of Psalms:    Prophecy Fulfillment   Psalm 107:23-30 Matthew 8:23-27. Jesus calmed the winds and the waves.   Psalm 69:8 John 1:11; John 7:5. Jesus was not received by his own people.   Psalm 41:9; Psalm 55:12-14 John 13:18, John 13:21. Jesus was betrayed by a friend.   Psalm 69:20 Mark 14:32-41. Jesus suffered alone in Gethsemane.   Psalm 22:7-8 Matthew 27:39-43. Jesus was mocked.   Psalm 22:16 Mark 15:25. Jesus was crucified.   Psalm 22:18 Matthew 27:35. The soldiers cast lots for Christs clothes.   Psalm 22:1 Matthew 27:46. Jesus asked the Father why he had forsaken him.   Psalm 69:21 John 19:28-30. Jesus was given vinegar for his thirst.   Psalm 34:20 John 19:33-36. None of Jesus bones was broken.   Psalm 31:5 Luke 23:46. Jesus commended his spirit to the Father and died.   Psalm 16:10 Acts 2:31-32; Acts 13:34-35. The Saviors flesh did not see corruption, being raised up in the Resurrection.     Suffice it to say that the writers of the New Testament books quote more verses from the book of Psalms than from any other book of the Old Testament. Indeed, out of a total of 283 direct citations from the Old Testament in the New Testament, 116 have been counted from this one book, many of them referring directly to Jesus Christ.       Easton's Bible Dictionary, Psalms  The psalms are the production of various authors. "Only a portion of the Book of Psalms claims David as its author. Other inspired poets in successive generations added now one now another contribution to the sacred collection, and thus in the wisdom of Providence it more completely reflects every phase of human emotion and circumstances than it otherwise could." But it is specially to David and his contemporaries that we owe this precious book. In the "titles" of the psalms, the genuineness of which there is no sufficient reason to doubt, 73 are ascribed to David. Peter and John (Acts 4:25) ascribe to him also the second psalm, which is one of the 48 that are anonymous. About two-thirds of the whole collection have been ascribed to David.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	its gorgeous..|`|Hz2L59BCaa	Not to change the subject or anything, but I need to tell you all that church folks are cute and cuddly.  .|`|si3eq11haa	i agree with fireball, the book of psalms really is gorgeous. it is a book full of love, and hope, and humanity relying on God. it is open and honest.     there is so much encouragement in there and it is totally relevant to us today.  try reading it in the amplified bible, or the new living bible.

It takes a great deal of control not to abuse any talent or ability we may have when we perceive that it is getting us the things in this life we may desire. However through, focus, meditation and prayerful introspection one can use power to serve and help her/his fellow woman/man. And use such abilities conservatively for that old adage is very true.

70a201d41704c2115cb56b74e112e905aa	This issue is going to be around for a few decades until the world (America is not the only country overweight) adopts a different philosophy on life. Some people want to enjoy food and as a result of that gain weight, develop diseases and die, and they are ok with that. Some people believe you should eat to live and not live to eat meaning you eat to provide nutrients to the body regardless whether you enjoy the food or not; the outcome is to live for eternity. But do you think people want to live forever? Most people would be happy if they make it to 70-80, others want to live 90-100, and others 200 years.    Many people would rather live an enjoyable life where they can make as much money as they want, buy whatever they want, and eat how much they want, without anyone stopping them. Most people don't want to spend their whole life in a gym eating oatmeal and carrots for the rest of their life, just to end up eventually dying. We are all going to die one day, lets enjoy it by doing whatever we want as long as it doesn't hurt anyone.|`|4tFuosueaa	No, Americans are still VERY overweight as a whole. The age is getting younger all the time. I feel sorry for lots of the kids and teenagers I see because they are already pudgy, or have bellies. Americans just don't eat right and with all the moms working now, no cooking & nutrition skills are being passed down to kids. They don't know how to eat right and no one is at home to cook for them, so they get McDonalds or KFC every night.  It's a shame.|`|IqqaA2wIaa	50% are...|`|rUgC7SPsaa	Nope.

Since most of the popular diets are wildly inappropriate, most diet advice is insane, most stores no longer sell good diet food, and most diet food that's sold contains additives that make people want to eat more, it's highly unlikely that anyone will actually lose weight from following any of these diets or watching any of these crazy shows.  Losing weight and keeping it off is extremely difficult, more difficult than quitting smoking or giving up an addictive substance like heroine.  But we love to laugh at fat people, who will die young of horrible diseases, after suffering terribly.  It's the all-American pastime, isn't it?  So laugh it up!

yOK32PM9aa	The main differences stem from the fact that Theravada sticks as close as possible to the actual teachings of the Buddha as remembered by those closest to him, whereas Tibetan Buddhism is a type of Mahayana Buuddhism which has been adapted so as to be more palatable and understandable in a particular culture.  Basically, in Tibetan there is more emphasis on a guru figure and upon beliefs in spirits; and a concentration upon the Bodhisattva ideal.  Both groups would, however, say that their similarities were much more important than the differences.

7kJFmyxdaa	According to the U.S Treasury fact sheet:    The motto IN GOD WE TRUST was placed on United States coins largely because of the increased religious sentiment existing during the Civil War. Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase received many appeals from devout persons throughout the country, urging that the United States recognize the Deity on United States coins.    The Congress passed the Act of April 22, 1864. This legislation changed the composition of the one-cent coin and authorized the minting of the two-cent coin. The Mint Director was directed to develop the designs for these coins for final approval of the Secretary. IN GOD WE TRUST first appeared on the 1864 two-cent coin.

"I have found Christian dogma unintelligible. Early in life, I absenteed myself from Christian assemblies."  ~ Benjamin Franklin    "Where do we find a precept in the Bible for Creeds, Confessions, Doctrines and Oaths, and whole carloads of other trumpery that we find religion encumbered with in these days?"   ~ John Adams    "The divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity."  ~ John Adams    "This would be the best of all possible worlds, if there were no religion in it."  ~ John Adams    "The Christian god can easily be pictured as virtually the same god as the many ancient gods of past civilizations. The Christian god is a three headed monster; cruel, vengeful and capricious. If one wishes to know more of this raging, three headed beast-like god, one only needs to look at the caliber of people who say they serve him. They are always of two classes: fools and hypocrites."  ~ Thomas Jefferson    "I do not find in orthodox Christianity one redeeming feature."  ~ Thomas Jefferson    "Christianity is the most perverted system that ever shone on man."  ~ Thomas Jefferson    "As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion"  ~ extract from the Treaty of Tripoli, 1796, drafted in person by George Washington|`|1cGlucXyaa	Because at one point this country was a Christian nation.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Fore Fathers.|`|d78420f6881261db90170d41d16536a0aa	It was a reaction to the 50's McCarthy era and it spurred the true beginning of politicization of Christianity.|`|Blajij6iaa	Judging by our current economic crisis, I'd say we bet on the wrong horse, eh?|`|AA11120822	I think there are two reasons American Christians use every opportunity to plaster their religious slogans everywhere, including on our money:    1.)

Christians are insecure in their faith, so they need to keep it in their own faces to reaffirm it over and over again.

d7xE8bYFaa	Tell that to the right-wing atheists and the Libertarian atheists.  We don't all share the same political beliefs, just the same lack of belief in a god or gods.    Personally, I'm such a left-wing moonbat that even Obama is too far to the right for me.  Of the original contenders for the Democratic nomination, I wanted Kucinich.  Honestly though, even he isn't radical enough for my taste.  I'm a pinko lunatic.  But that certainly doesn't apply to all atheists.  Why would it?  Lack of belief in a god or gods doesn't require or inform any particular political beliefs.    *Edit* -- I'm worse than a commie.  Communists are like Bill O'Reilly compared to me.    *Edit 2* -- It would take a long explanation to peg exactly where I am.  In the shortest terms possible, I'm very close to Noam Chomsky politically.  I'm very sympathetic to anarchism, but most anarchists would not consider me to be one of them.  I don't call myself an anarchist, but I'm not afraid of the term, either.  I guess I'm a proponent of direct, participatory democracy.    *Edit 3* -  I find it ironic that people who profess a love of freedom, democracy, and pluralism think that some ideas are "American" and some are "anti-American."  All ideas are allowed in a truly free society.  To answer your question, I'm uncomfortable with nationalism.  To say that one loves one's country is no more or less meaningful than saying that one loves Wisconsin or Sacramento or Cook County.  But I love living in a country that has freedom of speech and freedom of information, among other vital freedoms.  The US is a relatively priviledged country in that respect, and I love that.  I love living here.  I served in the US Army for four years.  In that sense, I'm "pro-American," I guess, but really I think that patriotism is a fairly useless concept and really only good for alienating dissenters and whipping people up into supporting wars.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsk...|`|2beAXP8aaa	Since it was christians that started the rumors that we eat babies, and kittens, and puppies,, too, I don't think your statement is very reliable!

The anonymous authors of the bible were the product of a society that would have been appalled at the idea that men and women were equal: they had more respect for their camels and donkeys than they had for their women.  Wives were of such little account that they were NEVER counted in any numbering of the Hebrews...and daughters could actually be SOLD into slavery by their fathers...or on his demise, by any close male relative.     To concretize the worthlessness of women, the patriarchal 'fathers' invented the Myth of Adam and Eve, making Eve not only a second class human being, but a temptress and the source of all evil: An attitude that eventually led Christians to persecute women as witches and devil worshippers.     To use Jesus of Nazareth as proof that Yahweh is a male is not just specious, but woefully ignorant.....thus it became necessary to INVENT a TRINITY, in which the false Messiah created by Paul was made consubstanial with Yahweh, of the same MALE substance and MALE essence from before time.|`|MMImKRAgaa	I call God what the scripture calls, he, Father, God not godess all pointing to a male|`|Hz2L59BCaa	God is a huge man and he has a wife and her name is Milly.|`|t88527U1aa	Jesus called him Father read the Bible it states consistently Abba(father)|`|afripzVJaa	a "mans" personality can only be referred to as dominant.|`|3CVPeDqxaa	jesus was a man, was he not?|`|ctCBcw41aa	God is a he i'm sorry to tell you that.

They were added a few hundred years after the Christian church was established by evil female-hating church officials who wanted to keep women "in their place."    Jesus had no beef with women and there's no indication that Paul was particularly anti-woman, either IF you read the scriptures that he wrote which scholars are pretty sure were authentic Paul.    Linguistically and doctrinally, there are a number of verses that don't seem to fit in the New Testament.  That's because they were added much later in an attempt to keep things "orderly" by degrading certain people.    I find that if you take out the questionable verses, the NT makes much more sense as a whole (though it still has some odd little snags here and there.)  Women had plenty of power in early Christianity, especially considering how oppressive their society was towards women.  But you put in a few choice verses here and there and focus on them, and you get a very different picture.

AA10674998	This is the first year that I have been interested in observing the feasts and so really I entered these fall feasts as a blank slate ... having to read on the internet what they were, when they were and how they are commemorated. The only person around that had any interest in experimenting with celebrating these feasts was a good friend named James. It was James that found a congregation of believers that celebrated the Day of Atonement in Dallas, and boy were we in for a treat but not because of the service or place but something totally unexpected!    By the time the 7 pm service was about to start, James and I weren't feeling tip-top. We had begun a fast from sundown the night before and so as sundown was around 7 ... we wound up snarfing a Cliff-bar and Coke zero before stumbling into the service just as it kicked off. There were about 5 others when we showed up and about 5-7 more showed up just after we got started. It was a low-key meeting without music and the speaker, Todd Baker of Brit Hadashah Ministries, was introducing a new study on Isaiah ... and we mostly got alot of background and context. In short the meeting was not much to write home about even though we got to see someone blow a shofar and we took bread and wine and experienced the lighting of the Sabbath candles, etc. No, I would not be wasting my time writing this note had something extraordinary not happened immediately after the service.    As soon as it was over, a couple of guys came right over and started telling James and I that YahShua (Jesus) spoke to them and told them that they should tell us something that they seldom tell anyone. Now, before I get into what they told us, or who these guys were, remember that we are in a strange place we have never been before and have no intentions of going back. It was an out of the way place and as it turns out, these guys don't make a practice of going to this fellowship either. What is more peculiar is that in the last few months these guys are not the only strangers that have come up to me and revealed exactly the same thing that these two people told us just as we were shaking hands for the first time.    "Hi, I'm Charles," he says, "this is Lonnie, and YahShua shined what looked like a spot light on you guys and told me that you two would understand that we are chosen to stay behind during the tribulation as servants of the second harvest."    James and I know just what Charles is talking about ... like I said, there are more than one stranger that we have met in the last few months with the same exact claim.    It is God's providence that Charles and Lonnie met us, because they felt isolated, not knowing any of the other 144,000 that God is raising up for the Day of the Lord that is soon to be upon us. They were lonely. But James and I know at least 3 others and we think that a fourth fella, Jay. Altogether that is potentially 5-6 that we know of. In short, we are able to fellowship with Charles and Lonnie, now that God has arranged for us to meet and to introduce them to some of the other 144,000 servants that we have had the pleasure of already meeting.    What makes this even more interesting is that Tim, one of the other servants that James and I have met, delivered a message not 30 hours earlier to James from the Lord that He would send those that belong to Him to James so that James could feed them. Here is the exact quote: ""I will bring them, says the Lord. Trumpet to every living creature and wait on the Lord... for I Myself shall bring them to you, says Your Redeemer, and you shall surely feed them even according to all I shall give you..." It wasn't 30 hours before we saw this fulfilled when we least expected it.    James and I went to LaMadeline with Charles and Lonnie and got better aquainted. I can't believe how similar these two fellas are to the other 4 that we know with the same calling. They are all very simple men, with tender hearts and all of them are riddled with weaknesses. Their training was through broken marriages, handicaps, rejections, and so forth. There is nothing remarkable about any of them as the world would say is remarkable. They are all poor, having hardly any possessions, and few friends. Most of them are sent packing by their families. They are rejected by the world because the world is jealous of their relationship to God ... which is so personal they can recount conversation after conversation on a word-for-word recall as long as anyone will listen to them.    James and I, sat there and asked a few questions and answered a few, as well. We could all sense that Jesus was right there with us grinning as He sat there invisibly and silently at the table with us.    Anytime you discover new friends it is special, but this was something extra special that I thought I would share ... I'm sure many of you will think I am crazy, and like I said before ... that is fine. Time will tell, whether there is anything to this. Search your heart. Search your|`|4GiIXWUXaa	Weight-loss, Headaches, nausea, disorientation, (confusion) drops in blood pressure, low electrolyte levels, fatigue ... you know, all the usual "miracles" that accompany self-starvation.    The longest i've ever gone without any food whatsoever was a month and a half. I think it was about 56 days. (Between that and 60+, but i forget at present).  Praise Jesus! I had to be hospitalized. It's a mircale I'm not dead! BUT that was relevant to an eating disorder and not a "spiritual journey."     I can still go several days to close to 2 weeks based on will power and liquid diets ..... but it has nothing to do with spirituality. I've been eating every day for a while. But i generally alternate not eating a few days here and there in between during any given week of my choosing.    I do not ever go onto spiritual fasts. I've had issues with Eating Disorders so it is not healthy for me to go several days without food; though i tend to do it anyway, I CAN turn it into a "spiritual thing" if i wanted to, but I can honestly say that i've not done that in a really long time.     I weighed in at 121.2 ... a total of 5lb maintained increase in weight since November.     While i think that "Fasting" is a Biblical concept ... i do not think that all fasts are necessarily of a pious nature. Make sure your motivations are proper. *sighs* The only miracles that accompany a "fast" that I've ever heard of were weight-loss.      xoxo  ?

I get to that in a moment, but first ... remember the words of Fran Leibowitz: You shouldn't be writing poetry unless you're dead.  Good advice for all of us!    Now, back to that spiritual question about your poetry.  Let's see ...    In the words of your poem, we are to see religion, science, demons, pastors, government, anarchy, and warriors as in some way one in the same killing machine?  Does that make ANY sense at all?    Within the bowels of your poem we see compliments to these entities that you end with the sneering line ... "And the people they have killed."  So, tell me, spiritually speaking, how is it that government has killed so many people and yet in your words "kept [you] free"?  How is it that religion is at once moralizing the world and killing people?      I believe your poem is pompous and pseudo-intellectual, but cannot stand up to any logical or intellectual scrutiny.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

They simply maintain hope, or faith, that the big old story is true... because wouldn't it be nice to go to a place like heaven and live forever?    It sure would. But no amount of hope, or faith, makes something real anywhere other than in your imagination.|`|0yPfYLEFaa	Can you admit that He might be real?|`|LLey4VRzaa	Can you admit Jesus Lived?  Flavius Josephus, who lived until 98 A.D., was a romanized Jewish historian. He wrote books on Jewish history for the Roman people. In his book, Jewish Antiquities, he made references to Jesus. In one reference he wrote:    About this time arose Jesus, a wise man, who did good deeds and whose virtues were recognized. And many Jews and people of other nations became his disciples. Pilate condemned him to be crucified and to die. However, those who became his disciples preached his doctrine. They related that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion and that he was alive. Perhaps he was the Messiah in connection with whom the prophets foretold wonders. [Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, XVIII 3.2]    Pliny the Younger, proconsul in Asia Minor, in 111 A.D. wrote to Emperor Trajan in a letter:    ...it was their habit on a fixed day to assemble before daylight and recite by turns a form of words to Christ as a god; and that they bound themselves with an oath, not for any crime, but not to commit theft or robbery, or adultery, not to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded. After this was done, their custom was to depart, and meet again to take food...    Roman historian, Tacitus, who is respected by modern scholars for historical accuracy, wrote in 115 A.D. about Christ and His Church:    The author of the denomination was Christ[us] who had been executed in Tiberius time by the Procurator Pontius Pilate. The pestilent superstition, checked for a while, burst out again, not only throughout Judea...but throughout the city of Rome also...     Other secular witnesses to the historical Jesus include Suetonius in his biography of Claudius, Phlegan recording the eclipse of the sun during Jesus' death and even Celsus, a pagan philosopher. It must be kept in mind that most of these sources were not only secular but anti-Christian. These secular authors, including the Jewish writers, had no desire or intention to promote Christianity. They had no motivation to distort their reports in favor of Christianity. Pliny actually punished Christians for their faith. If Jesus were a myth or His execution a hoax, Tacitus would have reported it as such. He certainly would not have connected Jesus' execution to Roman leaders. These writers presented Jesus as a real historical person. Denying the reliability of these sources in connection to Jesus would cast serious suspicion on the rest of ancient history.    Now these ancient secular writings do not prove that Jesus is the Son of God or even the Christ, but that is not the goal of this tract. These reports show that a virtuous person named Jesus did live in the early first century A.D. and authored a religious movement (which still exists today). This Person was at least called Christ - the Messiah. Christians in the first century also appeared to consider Him God. Finally these writings support other facts found in the Bible surrounding His life. The claim that Jesus never existed and His life is a myth compromises the reliability of ancient history.|`|bFfdbWk2aa	There is No possibly way that I can ever say that God is a fake because i know that he is real so why would i say that there might be a possibility that he is fake/imaginary     just doesn't make any sense to me|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Your list of alternate gods is remarkable.  However you claim about what 'we know' might not be satisfactory to anyone who has experienced any degree of the numinous.    I can admit that everything is a fake, and with the poet say,     'Alas, my life has only been a dream!'     But that is not what I believe, and I would be insincere were I to say such a thing.  Just as there are 'horses for courses,' so also there are 'Gods for believers,' and I like mine very much and have certain knowledge that he lives.    Could I be deluded?  I could be, but I do not believe I am.  And so I roll forward along my contented way, doing no harm to anyone regardless of whether they have faith, religion, spirituality, atheism, or not.    I am acutely aware that my attitude and practice troubles some.  But why should what I believe and do be of any consequence to anyone else, especially to strangers whom I will likely never meet?  Only those known by the ungainly but accurate title 'control freak' give a hoot  about what others do or don't do.

AA10836301	Sodom and Gomorrah was an example to the world that unlawful practices have to be dealt with or the lawless will be to great to handle.  In Judges the other eleven tribes almost wiped out the tribe of   Benjamine for trying to make any man that came by be partakers with them.  The man that had a concubine that was killed by these lawless men, her dead body was used to expose them to the other tribes, they handled the problem.|`|AA10422711	This chapter gives an account of a sad affair of a Levite and his concubine, and of the bad consequence of it, how that she played the whore, and went away from him to her father's house, whither he followed her, and where he was kindly entertained by her father several days, Jdg_19:1 and then set out on his journey to his own country; and passing by Jebus or Jerusalem, he came to Gibeah, and could get no lodging, Jdg_19:10, but at length was taken in by an old man, an Ephraimite, Jdg_19:16 when the house where he was beset by some wicked men in Gibeah, with the same intent as the men of Sodom beset the house of Lot, Jdg_19:22 and after some expostulation of the old man with them, the concubine was brought out to them and abused by them even unto death, Jdg_19:25 upon which the Levite her husband cut her into twelve pieces, and sent them into all the coasts of Israel, which was shocking and surprising, Jdg_19:29 the consequence of which is related in the next chapter.|`|AA10148658	That (wicked) men that will not judge and control themselves, will be judged by God.    Heb 10:31  It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.|`|AA10484153	In Chapter 19 what we have is that men would have rather had the men of the household (homosexuality) and because they couldn't they proceeded to take the concubine, which would not have been considered a full-fledged wife at the time, but a form of property to propagate the need for sons, even though he is referred to as a son-in-law.  For her to have gone back to her father would have not been unusual, and for them not to have been given abode would not have been unusual as she was probably marked in some manner as for the usage of reproduction only.  His anger was expressed by cutting her and sending her parts to the various remnants of Israel to say that revenge would be sought against these people for taking her life and the vileness they had chosen.  Not a lot of difference than what we see today, men want men, and women want women, when they feel threatened they beat the opposite to death either figuratively or literally, physically or legally, and most of us stand by and act all stunned when what we should be doing is standing up and shaking the figurative pieces of the dead and saying how long will we allow this to go on?|`|AA11574578	well...lets see.....i do have a tendency to forget what i am going to say..or write..so hope i can finish this before that happens..old age ya know.......they are traveling through the land belonging to the tribe of benjamin.....which are kinsmen...so they obey the law of moses...a tradition is to invite a kinsmen..rather you know them or not into the house...not let them leave without feeding them..etc...the sons of Belial are actually sons of demons...translation. is belial is demon...or satan....a non believer of the law of moses..or .the one true god...they has for the man to sent out to them to know him...meaning they want him sexually...the old man says no...i can't...he is under my protection...i invited him in...cannot harm him.....the woman was actually dead...when she was carved up...sent to the 12 tribes...he is asking for help...the pieces is a sign that he was defiled....they represent a  witness against those who killed the woman...so what is going on...do not mingle among the unbelievers...for you will fall prey to them...and become liken to them...stay among your own|`|AA12228580	Judges 19:1  "Now it came about in those days, when there was no king in Israel..."    (the same story continues through the end of the book of Judges)     Judges 21:25 "In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes."    This is the lesson:    When the people do not follow a recognized leader, everyone thinks they have a right to make their own decisions, and so become their own authority.  Even large groups of people can join together in making seriously wrong decisions.    God eventually established  human kings, which became another practical lesson, teaching that no human authority will ever be perfect.    Then He sent Jesus as King of Kings and Lord of Lords, indicating that all are to subject themselves to His authority.     "All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.  Go therefore ,,, Mt 28:18---    Therefore, today there is a King for all people, and as God put it, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well-pleased.  Hear Him." Mt17:5.|`|AA11124874	It's kind of like those movies we have like Mad Max, where there is a gang, of overwhelming numbers and well-armed, tormenting the innocents in the area.    It was the absolute duty of a host to protect an invited visitor in his home, by any means necessary, even unto the sacrifice of his most valued and loved members of his house. An armed gang of bandits shows up at his doorstep and wants to rape his male guest, and instead are molified by taking the women of the house. The host and his guest are outnumbered and outweaponed. Remember, this was a time before serious police forces, and there was no way to really call for help. These were delinquents from the neighborhood, not external enemies of Israel.    When the concubine was raped to death, the husband divided her parts up and sent them around the country as direct physical evidence of the wrong done to his household...consider it a very crude form of DNA evidence....    The whole incident is a trigger for civil war between the tribe related to the wrongdoers (the tribe of Benjamin) and the rest of Israel, who sided with the wronged husband (a concubine did not have the property rights, inheritance, or household authority that a wife did, but the man was expected to treat her justly, and as a husband in all other things). This is especially poignant because he loved her so well that he was willing to forgive her cheating on him and then running away back to her father. After his evident love and forgiveness of her, his affection and connection with her father and family, and the strong effort he made to protect her from temptation by making a beeline back home... As well as the wrong done to the host, who put his virgin daughter's life ahead of his guest's life, per the laws of hospitality.    A side moral here is that when travelling, don't tarry and impose on strangers, especially in dark and dangerous times.    Because the Benjaminites sided with the evildoers, they were defeated in battle by G-d's will, their families and livestock captured and destroyed, and the 600 mostly male survivors of that tribe ended up hiding in some caves. Finally, they negotiated for their lives, but were refused from regaining families by marrying into other tribes of Israel, and were sent out to capture wives from neighboring enemies of Israel. The only reason why even that was allowed (them keeping their lives) were that they were bretheren of Israel, even if wrongdoers.

For real.    The bit about, "You KNOW, and there's a difference.  You've seen..." is totally true.    Faith is a belief in things you haven't experienced.  If you had proof that God existed (well, not empirical, but anecdotal, which is still proof to the person/people who experienced it), you would KNOW that God existed, and faith wouldn't be an issue.    An interesting quirk (some would say design flaw, but I'll call it a quirk) of faith in God is that you have to believe without any signs or wonders.  If you get some, it's a whole 'nother ball game.  You can ask for signs all you want, but you're not likely to get any because then it would take away your faith and replace it with knowledge.      That said, I think that many people (atheists and believers alike) have much too limited an idea of what God is.    The Bible says God is love.    If you believe in love, you believe in God, by that reckoning.    So that would probably convert a lot of atheists who previously refused to believe in something more specific.     It's fine if you don't believe in a bearded sky guy or helmet-clad maidens or many-armed deities.  But if you don't believe in love...well, sh*t.  I don't know what to tell you.    So, if God is love, then there are probably very few true atheists.  I mean, who hasn't ever experienced love?  Not at all?  Who doesn't believe in love even a little bit?  Not even for a puppy?  A kitten?    I say if you don't believe in love, then you're an atheist.  Anybody who doesn't believe in love is absolutely damned, no doubt about it.  A life without love is certainly hell (never mind the afterlife.)  Anybody without love is bereft of the heaven that love can provide, that's for sure.    So, how many true atheists are there if God is love?  I'd say very few indeed.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	The man whispered, "God, speak to me" and a meadowlark sang.  But, the man did not hear.     So the man yelled, "God, speak to me" and the thunder rolled across the sky.  But, the man did not listen.    The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined brightly.  But the man did not see.    And, the man shouted, "God show me a miracle." And, a life was born.  But, the man did not notice.    So, the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are here."     Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But, the man brushed the butterfly away .   and walked away.

There are many examples where I personally witnessed it. Some of them not so big a deal, and some really disgusting.     I'd say one that was not so big a deal, and the first time I noticed it, was when I was a kid. Walking around an amusement park with my cousin (who is mixed, while I'm white). We got stares, as well as one person making a comment under their breath about what kind of parents I must have, to let me date outside my race.    The absolute worst though was my freshman year of high school. I think if I hadn't moved to the school I did I wouldn't really believe things like this happened. There was a handicapped boy who was black (he was one of maybe three black/mixed students within the entire school). Some of the jocks and popular guys actually had him walking around saying things like "KKK rules" and "white supremacy lives" etc. I tried to tell him not to say those things, but there's not a whole lot you can say to a handicapped kid who believes he's just doing what his "friends" want him to do. Instead I dared the jerks who said it to go up to another black guy in my grade, and repeat what they said, and see how well it went over. Then I went to the counselors office and let them know what was going on. I have no idea what came of it all.    That's not the only example I can recite, but by far it was the one that disgusted me more than any other. So to those who say racism is practically no more, I disagree. Those kids learned from someone to feel the way that they did.|`|S2uAq7i4aa	I'm Jewish..  So many stupid,pointless,ignorant jokes.  And none of them makes sense,and none of them is true.

One of the things that she will remember is telling me that it aggravated her that my son "whined" when he was 5 years old, because he was a boy and it did not bother her when her daughter did it. I told her " my son "whines" because your daughter is not nice to him" I am guessing that since my son is the next heir to the throne, that he is just a normal little boy and not a whiny little brat.|`|AA11586837	Hey!

If you mean in society, that all depends on what you beleive in.    Everyone has their own moral fiber that deems them able to choose whether to lie, cheat, steal, as well as being able to tell the truth, being loyal, and hard working.    Honestly, as a christian I see no need to lie. Lying has gotten me into trouble, and it's too much work to cover up one lie after another.     However.... it doesn't hurt to bend the truth if it doesn't hurt anyone. That has gotten me out of some sticky situations.

Therefore, I propose that absolute truth exists whether any one individual chooses to believe in it or not.     I can't answer whether it is necessary because you need to specify what you mean by "necessary." Necessary for what? Reality? Since it exists, then it is necessary for reality. A reality without it would not be reality.    On a moral level:    Absolute Truth is the foundation of meaning. If each person provides their own truth, then we use a lot of terms that are meaningless. Right, wrong, death, life, good, bad, exist, human, sane, etc. The sexual predator in the psych ward who eats cardboard and bangs his head against the wall is just as right as Mother Theresa or Obama. There is no such thing as mental illness. No such thing as intelligence. No such thing as human.     If you ask where I am and I say "here" it means nothing to you. If I say "Boinkville" that means nothing to you, because it is nonsense. If I say "Germany," that means something to you. Even though the name is a human invention, it is a commonly accepted reference to a particular spot on the surface of the Earth, which is not a human invention and which we can both agree exists whether we have ever been there or not. In the same way, morality without a "really real" reference point has no meaning.    In short, I have never met or heard of a person who could live consistently as if there were no absolute truth.

You see there are some people that I meet in life who are simply miserable. They have no passion, no joy, they are cynical about everything, even love.      If you live your whole life this way, I would imagine at some point, you would be more upset if things were to change.  If you were to become passionate or overjoyed or fall in love, it wouldn't make you happy because you would be a huge jolt to a self centered lifestyle.    After a life like that, hell would just be the next logical step.    There is a book that muses about this concept call "The Great Divorce" by C.S. Lewis.  Basically it illustrates how different lifestyle react differently to the afterlife.  And for some heaven seemed like hell, and hell seemed like heaven.  A mother for instance wanted to find her son and people kept telling her that he had gone into paradise and that she should follow him there.  But she absolutely refused and wanted why her son was not being allowed to come and stay with her, in hell.    You see even if her son or all of her friends and her entrire family were in heaven,  she would not want to go there.  No one is really sent to hell, they simply prefer it.    It is a very compelling story.     Hope that helps.|`|oV0Lux4Maa	I will be there to keep you company to.

Kw7xRAE3aa	I always thought that maybe it was because since they were born Muslim it isnt really like a religion but something more like.....cultural.

Both are belief in things that are not proven to be true. Not to mention the immoralities in Islam. No, not the media Islam, the Islam you believe in.    I also know that those who 'revert' to Islam were never 'true' followers of their previous beliefs to begin with.    This question has been asked a number of times, by the way.|`|VUUKzbwLaa	same here......    islam makes soo much sense....  no other religon is as perfect as islam...i can honestly say that till this day, i have not found one fault in the pure religon of islam.....    people who were "born muslim" and are no longer muslim were not muslim in the 1st place. Their parents didn't educate them enough about islam, they just left them to think for themselves, and in this western society, if parents do that, their kids o astray. Ive seen tons of so-called muslims who have practiceing parents, but the parents are either too lazy to teach their children about the aspects of islam or they don't care at all....so they just fend and think for themselves, and hang out with chirstains and then they start compareing christanity with islam...and they see that there are not alot of rules in christanity so they go for that religon.....its completely ridiculous...     but...islam is the fastest growing religon in the world....it wouldnt be..if people found a fault in it  peace.|`|JiaGiVexaa	Actually i asked the same question to my friends as i cannot imagine that ever happening to me or anyone i know. Then i realised that, they were never muslim to begin with. Being muslim is not just a name it's a whole way of life, and needs a strong Iman. Their iman was very weak, they never practised islam just were born so. So it was easy for them to be drifted away from their principles as they never had any from the beginning. They are more fascinated by the western way of life. They drink, do not pray, sleep around, never read the Koran.... so they are not muslim.  Also nuts coco admitted in one of his posts that his real name was Yesser George, which is a common christian name in Egypt.  So basically he is an ex christian, so then you get the liars too.|`|dAcNaajsaa	Nice question but doesn't seem like there is any genuine response from a person who really left it wallahualam (And god knows best)    Lets start with some rough definitions.    Islam - Submission to God  Muslim - one who submits to God    As you can see from this and from the message our prophet Muhammad brought, every person is born as a muslim. Ie, as one who is in submission to God.    Then God raises them and teaches them language and so forth till they grow to puberty from which time they are treated as adults and held responsible for their actions in islam.     Therefore, every person is expected to search for the truth and accept it consciously and willingly without any other motive, such as societal or parental or cultural and monetary influences - all for the sake of God. This is the inherent desire or nature of every human - the fitrah - the natural 'primordial' /original state of submission to God to which they must conciously adhere to.    So if they are in a muslim family or christian family or any other religion, they must themselves search for the truth. if it happens that their family is on the true way of life, then they remain on it. Otherwise it is obligatory on them to change their way to what is true even if that means going against their family and the whole of mankind.    About disbelief    In Islam, it is generally referred to as kufr which linguistically means 'to cover'. This is because they cover that truth of the need to submit to God and try to hide it and take gods other than God like money, culture, jesus, idols, cows, or even themselves by worshipping their desires as God states in chapter 25 of Qur'aan.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    So there is the difference here that is critical to be pointed out. That is, that some people who seem to consider themselves apostates from islam never were muslim maybe in the first place conciously after puberty. They were perhaps muslim only because they were born into a muslim family without any knowledge of what islam is and so forth. Eg, in islam, if you do not pray, you are not a muslim, as our prophet has stated. So those who are here who claim to be apostates should clarify if ever they were muslims.      Those who leave islam are doing so for temporary pleasures, because islam is a way of life that has rules. That is because our Lord is GOD and islam is submitting to his laws. Some people do not like this. And it is not a coincidence that God has created whatever is on earth as an adornment for it in order to test the truthful believers from the hypocrites and liars although he knows all this before testing them. (See surah mulk ayah 1-2, and surah 18, first 10 ayaat)    The arguments the apostates bring are never logical or reasonable or unexlainable. Generally, you would find them slandering and having very shallow arguments not grounded in reality. perhaps they see muslims doing something or rather, muslims being shown to do something by their crafty clever media and, since they are superficial humans, they do not dig deeep into the matter to see whether this is really islam or this is someone trying to fool them. And so, they fail the test of God because they do not use that intelligence God has given to realise God as he should be realised.     For these people that commit the greatest crime of taking gods other than God, the purification is not possible due to the filthiness of the crime and hence, the need to be in hell forever.    For those muslims who commit sins, they may be required to spend a certain amount of time in Hell for purification. It is much better to purify and repent here on earth and bear the difficulties here because hell is much more severe.    This comes from a realisation of God that drives the person to create a barrier between himself/herself and the displeasure of God... rather, striving to create a barrier. And this can be a rough explanation of Taqwa, which in islam, is the criteria of the superiority of some humans over others.     God knows best. Please verify all at islamqa.com    So i challange any claimants to apostasy to islam to present their case logically. i doubt i will ever find one.|`|hMygg8cnaa	i realized that  if allah was going  to torture everyone  i loved and cared about,  i might as well  join 'em.|`|hfAsEiaZaa	ask nuts coco.

I doubt that anything makes people not want to believe. I was raised Church of England, I know my bible inside out, I have studied Islam in depth yet I just cannot find any anything that will convince me of the existence of god in the form that either religion requires. I live by a code of morals and ethics common to both, as these are really the most sensible ways to live. I have often wished that I had a strong faith and a conviction of a god as this makes life an awful lot easier, particularly at times of bereavement and in some respects I would even go so far as to say that I envy people with a deep faith (any faith), but so far nothing has made me believe.|`|iMplzgBtaa	I am really sick and tired of hearing Muslims be so stupid about this in their answers.  It's always the same damn thing:  "They thought Islam was too strict", "Some Muslims hurt them", "they didn't understand islam" oh and of course my fave "They weren't Muslim to begin with".  Why is it so frickin hard to believe they left it because they never believed in it or they researched it and found fault with it.  When a Christian converts to Islam the only thing Muslims say is "they found the truth", you never hear them say they didn't believe in Christianity.  You also seldom hear Christians say about them, "Someone hurt them, they didn't understand it, they thought it was too strict".  Why do Muslims have to make up excuses for the ex-Muslims.  Why can't they accept that ex-Muslims just found Islam to not be the truth since this is the same thing ex-Christians say about Christianity when they convert to Islam.  Why oh why oh why do Muslims have to be so damned closed minded about their religion and act so superior.  Go ahead and thumb me down as much as you want, it only proves your among those Muslims I speak about here, which is the truth.    Edit:  Chrisitianity is also a way of life, not just a religious belief.  Why would Muslims be so happy about Christians converting to Islam if they were too weak to follow the guidelines of Christianity to begin with.  You want someone like that representing your religion?

AA11690436	I'm actually still close with my college roommates.  Some of them bought a house together in San Francisco, and live semi-communally.  We called ourselves the Chowder tribe and often get together for Chowder Clan reunions.    (However, we all went to UC SantaCruz and lived in alternative housing known as the "sextets", which were large apartments built for six people but lacking internal walls; this lead to becoming either very close with the others, or learning to hate them very quickly.)    I, too, suck at relationships, but I've been very lucky in my friendships.|`|avVdKiWKaa	Wife and in-laws.  That's about it for me.  Both parents gone.

You are even able to connect to some of them in real life with your NorCal BBQ.    I too suck at dating, but at least you don't have the fear of your family arranging a marriage for you.    If you want a family but don't want kids then i suggest you find the right woman. Since it will be less likely for an unplanned pregnancy too occur.

I'm the only person in my family who has moved more than 15 minutes drive from the house they grew up in (bearing in mind my grandad was one of ten kids), I listen to metal and dress like some kind fo freak, and I like books and learning instead of tractors and mud.

We clashed constantly throughout my adolescence and young adulthood.....Now, I'd give my right arm just to have 10 minutes with him, even if he spent that entire 10 minutes berating me for abandoning my Catholicism and moving so far from home.    I understand what it is to feel alienated from one's family. I can't even discuss my agnosticism with them without fear of sparking a horrible argument (with the exception of my little brother, who's way more liberal than the rest of them).

She remarried another drunk. But as soon as my two sisters and I could leave the house, we did. I noticed that after I left, my mom had even less time for me than before, I didn't see my dad agian for another 25 years and so I really felt as though I had no one or "tribe".     No one could "get me" also, but then I had a pile of mental problems from the abuse. So I found a town that I liked, bought my own home and started adopting cats. It wasn't the grandest life, but it was my own. I started my own tribe ( I didn't want kids either).    Later, I became closer to God and started to pity my parents because they had thrown so much away for the booze. I started to "feel" normal and met a wonderful man and got married. Now his family is mine.    It's hard to get those "roots" going, but when you do, you will feel so much stronger because you know you can do it on your own.

My grandmother doesn't think we will ever get out of poverty, my uncle and aunt live on "crazy" checks. My mother is a felon, who cannot do any thing with her degrees, because she owes the government money. My birth dad is a junkie, who is always going back to prison.     My brother goes to college in a different state, and has a big debt. My little brother is annoying and hates me.    And my sister, who I only met once, is a teenager mother.     My best friend is so needy, and my other friends have kids and families to attend to.I feel alone most of the time, but I rather be alone than have the feeling of people making fun of me.    I used to get made fun of a lot because I tried to be like other people, and the people I wanted to be friends with didn't accept me.    As for relationships with the opposite sex, it sucks. Also I cannot find people like me in real life, because most people like to sit back and gossip, or talk about sex.    Something that I just don't relate to.    Its hard finding people like me, but I will continue to be me and just live my life.    Also I don't want a family either; I don't even think I want to be married.|`|t1ORKMxHaa	I can totally relate. My half brother/sister nieces and nephews are all very distant due to religious beliefs.     But, I have other family, especially now, that I don't always relate to so well, but they overlook the petty stuff, and focus more on love and caring for each other.     My old "tribe" of friends are kind of distant, but, that happens sometimes after marriages and relocations, ect.. Is always good to catch up with them though, and it's just like yesterday when we get a chance to reunite.     A true soul mate is the best thing for living a happy life, right after living a wholesome positively purposeful life.

Whenever I do anything with that side everything is always so formal and distant.      Dad's side is interesting as well.  His mum's side is completely crazy and illogical.  His mum had like 8 or 9 other siblings that moved to New York from the Island of Sicily (Italy).  Their father (my great-grandad) was a wife-beater who was not a good influence on his kids.  I don't talk to them much.      My Dad's paternal side is completely different.  Almost all of them are small-town minded, but they understand bigger cities.  We have reunions that are great fun.  I can't think of a single bad apple; they're all good, honest people.  I can also tell our "traditions" go back pretty far.  For instance, When we get together we always talk about everyone.  I'm not referring to gossip--more like referring to all the stories of our relatives both living and dead.  The stories go back quite a few generations too. (Most stop at great-great-great-grandpa, but there's a few remaining things going back all the way to the civil war.)    That's not my only family though.  My grove/kindred is my family too.  When I'm in ritual with them I feel like I'm at home.  There is a timelessness when I'm with them full of acceptance and love.      I don't know how to help you find that tribal lineage you want other than to seek it in your own family.  Perhaps you should organize some family gatherings, like a pot-luck picknick thing.  I'd normally advise you to find a like minded-religious group that you could find a close-knit group within, however I've found most atheistic groups tend to not form such close bonds.  I wish you luck in your endevors though =).

AA12220467	If you don't believe in Peter Pan are you acknowledging that Peter Pan has to exist for you not to believe in him? No. It's the same way with atheists and god.    I don't see how you come to the conclusion that something has to exist in order for there to be a disbelief in its existence, that's an illogical argument.    "I am not saying that you have to except something exists to deny it.

He is our "peace" (not our division). Mark and avoid them who cause "division": Rom 16:17    Jesus: "division" and not peace: Mt 10:34; Lk 12:51  (mark & avoid them which cause division: Rom 16:17)  Christ: "peace" and not division: Jn 14:27; Eph 2:15  (be at peace with all men)    "Jesus": "born under the law"  (ye are not under the law, but under grace)  "Christ": "the end of the law"  (he is our peace, who hath abolished the law)    Jesus: divided (law vs grace)  Christ: not divided (all grace, no law at all)    Jesus: died by the law  Christ: died to the law     Peace, with God, is "THROUGH Jesus->Christ".

It's not uncommon, and it's not incurable; but, it can   dangerous if it isn't treated.  If she's really a friend, she'll take your advice: tell her  to see a psychologist.

IF you are not opposed, there is nothing wrong (in Christianity!) with someone following Mosaic Law *and* Christian teachings.  So, like most of the Christians in the Christian bible (who were Jews before becoming Christians), you CAN raise your children to observe the beliefs of both without violating Christian doctrine.    It probably DOES violate Jewish doctrine, but the Jewish *practices* are not forbidden to Christians.    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...|`|vEEeq7kYaa	Intermarriage is a very common in Jewish life in the United States. Since non-Jews in this nation surround Jews (we comprise about 2 percent of the populace), many of us fall in love and marry non-Jewish spouses.  I am married to a non-Jew.   Therefore, I of all people, cannot be judgmental on this issue.  Know that is my perspective.    What I see in your question that tells of your relationship does not bode well, unless one of you is willing to make a great compromise and it doesnt appear that is something acceptable to either of you.  I disagree entirely with anyone who says, just let the children decide.  That is the worst decision of all. It is only ever so slightly worse than making a disrespectful ( even if well meaning) mish mash of two conflicting faiths.  Of course everyone here decided what they want to believe, so dont jump ahead with that, yet.  I want to go into detail why I say this.  I do not believe that a child should be raised in two conflicting belief systems.  You do no service to either religion to try to make a blending of them where there is incompatibility of belief.  Moreover, no rabbi I know of would perform a bris ceremony on a child who has been or will be christened.  The bris is a dedication of that child to the covenant of Israel and you cannot be dedicated to two DIFFERENT covenants simultaneously.  a child needs a sense of identity and that if you do not give that child a clear identity they are easy prey for ANY cult as a young teen or adult when they are searching for their own identity.  The strongest lure of the cult is a strong sense of identity.    I often surprise some of my readers who see me as very strongly Jewish (and I am).  I tell them with all sincerity, I would rather see a child raised Christian than raised in a dishonest and unintelligible mish mash that dishonors both traditions.  I would also rather see them raised without any religion than the kind of confusion where a child thinks they can be both at the same time.   Before I begin trying to explain in detail why I strongly believe that one should choose one or the other rather than try to make the children belong to two religions simultaneously I will let you know about my own family.  My husband and I decided before we married that any child we had would be raised Jewish.  He was raised Southern Baptist, but not in a particularly observant home.  His grandmother gave him much of his spiritual ethics and teaching and as he grew older he became an agnostic.  He does not care to affiliate with any organized religion.  I respect his decision.  My husband is the most honest man I have known outside of my father.  They also became best friends and grew to love each other. How much more blessed could I be?      This does not mean that we ignore or disrespect the religion of many family members on my husbands side.  He has family that is active in the church, singing in choir, etc.  We have gone to celebrate family gatherings with them on Easter and Christmas Eve.  They are not religiously significant for us, but are significant times to connect to family and to help teach our son about this portion of his heritage.  This is also important for him in developing a sense of self in relation to the world around him.  My husband participated in the bris of our son and he participates with us in Jewish family life, in daily prayers and in celebrations of holiday events.  We recently celebrated the occasion of our son being called to the Torah as a Bar Mitzvah. He does not wish to convert to become Jewish and I am not going to try to convert him.  He knows and respects that my Jewish faith is important to me and he understands that the ethics of Judaism is good for helping to build strong family values of our own.  This works for us just fine.   Our son has a solid identity as a Jewish person in a Jewish home.     It is in the best interest of a child  to help give the child a clear message of identity for the parents to choose a path that does not confuse the children.  You cannot honestly dedicate the child to the body of the Church in Jesus and also make the child a part of the Covenant Community of Israel.  The very name of the ceremony means covenant. Brit/bris = covenant.     When it comes to religion; one is better than none and better than two.  A solid and unambiguous faith identity giving them a feeling of home in the world when it comes to spiritual awareness is important.       This can be a very tough decision when parents have strong feelings of connection to their own faiths or faith communities.  Even if the parent does not have a strong sense of faith, grandparents often add their own hopes and the sense of family connection through faith identity can be strong. Both sides do not want to ask too much sacrifice from the other.  Each parent usually has a sense of what he or she can and cannot tolerate of his or her own belief.  If the decision as to what your children will be raised waits until you decide to have a child or until after your child is born, this can create a volatile situation within the marriage and extended family.    Many parents who have put off the decision at this point think they can just cover both bases and appease both sets of families. They think, we are being tolerant and will please both families we will expose them to both religions in our family life and then let them choose which one they want to be when they are older.     I have known people raised this way and I have read studies about this and it is almost always a bad decision. Most of them speak of never feeling completely accepted by either religious community, going through worse self identity crises in adolescence than their peers and many became resentful to both parents in attempts to not hurt the feelings of either of them.

It sounds really heartbreaking.    First, the easy part - try to take what your parents will think off the table.  I can completely understand how agreeing to raise their only grandchildren as Catholics (and that's what baptism is, period) would hurt your parents.  But your religion is a personal decision - what you believe and are committed to, and not up to your parents once you reach adulthood.  If you truly believed that Catholicism was best for you and your children, you would not have the same trepidation talking to your parents about it - after all, it would be your decision and your children.  Also, bringing your parents' feelings into the discussion would mean bringing your boyfriend's parents (and probably siblings, and definitely grandparents on both sides) into the discussion as well - don't think that your boyfriend won't tell you what your future family is saying and thinking if you tell him about your current one - are you ready to hold out under that much pressure?  If he is insisting on baptism and confirmation - raising the kids as Catholics (and again, confirmation takes years of study - it's not a harmless little sprinkle and you're done) - before you even have any kids, then chances are his entire family are very firm on the subject - possibly far more firm than your own parents are, if they allowed you to date outside Judaism knowing full well that this is where you might end up.  I'm guessing that even if you had a bat mitzvah, you were not raised with regular synagogue attendance and full-on holiday observance - that like most American Jews (and most American Catholics nowadays - it cuts both ways), you were raised with just enough religion to give you an identity but not enough to give you any meaning behind it or a sense of belonging.  So bringing your parents into this will only backfire on you.    Which leaves it up to you.  Let me tell you, as a Jew, that it is impossible to raise a child as both Jewish and Christian.  You can introduce them to both religions, you can give them a feeling for both of them, but Christianity by definition believes itself to be Judaism done correctly - and Catholicism further goes against Judaism by saying that G-d can be a trinity and you can pray to a statue of Mary or Jesus, while still believing in the Jewish scriptures which make it crystal clear that there is only one G-d (in the shema) and that you can not bow down to idols or make an image of G-d (in the ten commandments).  Catholics truly believe there is no contradiction there.  Jews do not accept such a blatant disregard of the word of our G-d.  I am NOT saying either faith is right or wrong (though as a Jew I have my suspicions ;).  I am saying that the two faiths are incompatible with one another, and what you will end up with is either a confused child who can not believe any religion, or a Catholic child.  After all, Jews are a tiny minority in the world, and Catholics are a large and healthy community - when you're a kid, it seems like everyone has a Christmas tree, everyone goes to church on Sunday, everyone believes in Jesus.  The way Jews stay different is by intentionally reinforcing the child's knowledge that we are different - but if one of their parents is of a different faith, that becomes impossible.  Even if you could get your boyfriend to back down about Confirmation, and to agree to a circumcision alongside the baptism (treating both as a superstitious do-it-for-the-family thing rather than a tenet of faith), I can guarantee you 100% that your own grandchildren will all be Christians.  Christianity is simply easier than Judaism - it requires almost no sacrifices to everyday life, you get the Christmas tree and Easter eggs, and 85% of the country agrees with you.  Why would someone choose Judaism when they were raised to believe that all the things that make Judaism special, aren't necessary anymore thanks to Jesus?      So it really is up to you what you want.  If you truly mean "over my dead body," then I think marrying this man will be a mistake.  I believe that two people who believe in two different faiths can absolutely have a successful marriage, if they remain childless - there's a certain "don't ask, don't tell" that grownups can achieve if they work at it.  But if either partner truly believes in their religion, and the other does not (let alone if the other truly believes in a different faith), then there is no way to maintain a happy marriage and have children.  The only way to raise kids is if both partners are on the same page - with education, with discipline, and if there is going to be religion, then with that too.  If a child asks "Is Jesus the Messiah?" what are you going to say? As a Jew you can not say yes, but as a parent agreeing to raise a Catholic child you not only can't say "no," you can't even say "people have different opinions." And your husband will simply say "yes, of course." How can a child be raised 'both' religions when they cannot get two answers on something so basic to the faith he is being taught?    If you do decide this matters to you, let me assure you that there are lots of wonderful Jewish men out there. And having background in common is generally worth it when starting out in marriage - there are so many other things to fight about (sex, money, family) that can doom a relationship without having to add religion into the mix as well.    Just my two cents. Good luck in this.|`|AA11796124	>    No. Children of Catholic parents, even if only one parent is Catholic MUST be brought up in the Catholic Faith. This means Baptism, first Holy Communion, and Confirmation.    Since you feel so strongly against any childrens' exposure to Catholicism at all - one wonders why you are even considering marrying a Catholic!    If you want to marry a Catholic, you have to make peace with your spouse's Catholicity, and the fact the children WILL be exposed to that Catholicity.    If it means that much to you, so be it, but you should break off any plans to marry. Our religious convictions define us more than any other variable. It is, quite literally, a part of each of us. To marry someone is to profess an unconditional love for that person. So long as you reject your prospective spouse's Catholicity, you don't have an unconditional love for this person. Ergo, you are ill-prepared to marry at this point in time.      >    Since you and your parents have such strong feelings of the matter, you best not attempt marrying someone who isn't Jewish.|`|AA12245463	There's no other way.  Do it now.  It won't get any easier later.  You will always regret not raising your children as Jews.  .|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Well, a compromise certainly seems to be out of the question, since you're taking the "over my dead body" stand on things. If you are serious about that, then you  have no choice but to break up with him and find a nice Jewish boy.    On the other hand, if that was just a bit of hyperbole on your score, then you can consider some real compromises. First, you should --as a couple -- take a class in Judaism and another class in Catholicism (which is free at his church. It's called RCIA.) Then you'll know enough to figure out how to compromise.    For example, some couples have found it best to raise the kids "both" in the sense that they are spiritually one religion but they also observe the cultural traditions of the other. In your case, you might allow the children to be baptized and have their First Communion in the Catholic Church, but also raise them to know, understand and observe the Jewish faith (going to Shabbat every Saturday and Mass every Sunday). Then when it comes time for either bar/bat mitzvah or confirmation -- both of which are "coming of age" rites -- you allow each child to choose for him/herself.     I suggest this might be your best option, since you seem to be only culturally Jewish yourself. You say you are concerned that your parents have only one child, so your kids ought to be Jewish for their sake -- nothing at all about how you believe Judaism is the absolute truth in worshiping the Lord and everything else pales by comparison. So if you really aren't all that into it, you might as well let your boyfriend (husband) take the lead on faith issues.|`|D3JVIjz8aa	Oh dear!|`|LLnNjH94aa	I don't think it's going to end well.|`|ow2gVYeqaa	In this particular case, you would be wise to listen to him.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	No one can help baptism. So that doesen't count since they drown you when you cant fight for yourself. Bring the kids around BOTH your beliefs, and let them choose when their older. We are all born atheist anyway. That's why children are so sweet and worry about the important stuff, like flowers and ice cream!|`|AA10802033	Ok, here is what i think you should do. you should compromise. You should get the children baptised. but i think that you should let them choose. Educate them on both of your faiths. and do it lovingly. teach them about your god, and how great he is. and in a Roman Catholic church, you arent confirmed until you are in the eigth gade. so let them choose what they believe once their faith is developed. gopd luck =)|`|LYnuEdKUaa	You're not gonna like this, but he's right.  Per the rules of the Catholic Church, to get married, both people must agree to raise the kids Catholic.  It is a rule that is often ignored, but it's there.    Since you're Jewish and you believe everyone is going to heaven anyway, I don't see why it matters so much?|`|aPtk8iEXaa	You could both make an agreement that you teach both religions to your children and let them make up their own mind as an adult what they want to do.      I was baptized as a baby too but now at 42 I feel I need to be re baptized in the name of Jesus because I understand and feel his love.    but I won't be baptized a Catholic or any RELIGION for that matter; I will be baptized a follower and believe of Christs Church not mans.|`|7ufheV16aa	It is a sin for a Catholic to marry a non-Catholic or convert to a different religion, so I guess if you aren't willing to convert, then your marriage won't be valid. You can get married, but it won't be a valid marriage in God's eyes. Plus, since you and your boyfriend follow two different religions, your children will grow up very confused and not know what to follow. (For example, my sister's friend's dad is Jewish, her mom's Catholic. They went thru their whole lives confused about their faith;  they even made a name for their belief, since people kept asking them what they believed in.)|`|ecbe0658102674f8ad91e0162ac2a91faa	Dear lovely ''Romeo & Juliette'',  I suppose your baby-boy can have a circumcision :)  and also have a bath in the holy water of the Baptism in Jesus Christ.  After all God is still ONE!  And your children shall be more lucky to be raised into a such great family, of great believers in the only God the humankind have always had.  Respect one each other belief, and your children shall respect you both and the whole world.  Be blessed through your love!    Edit:  That's right the Catholics don't have a whole bath at their Baptism as an Orthodox has in their first months of life, but something more simbolic, later. And they are much more rigid than the Orthodox, the same as the Judaism.  My Orthodox Religion is not so strict. It's really more compasionate. I'm so sorry for both of you.    If YOU do not look at it as a sacrifice, probably your LOVE shall win over this issue, and you'll rise your pure love over this world. To become a Christian for a Jew it mustn't be a sin, not at all. But to leave the Christian beliefe in the favor of Judaism is another Jesus' crucification ...    The best way is to show your understanding & your love power. Usualy the woman takes her husband Religion, belief; she bow to his whole understanding ... if we are talking about the Religion!|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	Any future with him will necessarily have to be a Catholic one.    Your parents will get over it.    It's been 2000 years already, for what are you waiting?|`|d0f93ace5169bf1fc1696345cdb101c2aa	Probably not.  However, the website below provides great resources for interfaith couples.|`|jJxUCkkFaa	i cannot really say , but maybe a counselor can help you get to resolution with your boyfriend|`|ndY6nU5Daa	Michelle R and mama pajama gave great answers.    Two more things:    1. As has been pointed out, intermarriage is fairly common, But I would say that is only true of couples where one or both of the partners does not care much about their religion.  I believe intermarriages are very rare where both care strongly -- as seems to be the case here.  Where one says "I care a lot" and the other says "whatever", there can be a middle ground.  I honestly don't see a middle ground in this case.    2.  Even for couples where the Jewish partner doesn't feel strongly about his or her religion, there are issues.  I know a number of intermarried couples, and have heard virtually exactly the same thing from every one of the Jewish halves of those couples:     "I figured it wouldn't be a big deal because [pick one: 'we'd raise the kids with both and let them choose'; or 'Judaism's not that important to me so I figured it wouldn't bother me'; or 'all religions teach the same values so what's the big deal'; or 'I don't believe in Christianity, so I figured why would I care about having the kid go to church and mouth some words that have no effect'].   But now that we have kids, it's really hard.  I never knew what a huge conflict this would become, both with my spouse and within myself -- I guess I really did care after all.  Now I'm stuck."    And that's from people who didn't think it would be a big deal.  Imagine how much harder it will be for someone who cares enough to say "over my dead body".    Edit:    Re Sparki's suggestion:  I know the suggestion is well meaning, but that is not a compromise.  Having a child baptized and take communion is most definitely not a middle ground.  It is Christian.  It's really as simple as that.      The suggestion is therefore, in effect: "Go with the Catholic thing.  Also, make sure the kid knows that part of his family background includes Jews and he should learn about that."    Practicing Judaism is incompatible with practicing Catholicism.  That doesn't mean Judaism is the "one true path" or anything like that, but it does mean you can't be both at once.

If it were a reference to the 2nd coming, there would be some REALLY old people around somewhere, since that hasn't happened yet. We can know this because when He comes the second time in final judgement, the earth will cease to exist: "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up."

I think you might be saying that if we all go off in different directions, we can't accomplish anything. If so, I can certainly see your point, and agree with it to a degree. God is not about division - he adds and multiplies. Sometimes we, His people, can get caught up focusing on individual styles and differences, and forget that He wants us to love and accept each other as opposed to judging.

"I invite everyone to a ceasefire quickly. If a ceasefire is delayed, I see the risk of an escalation and the complete destruction of the opportunity for co-existence," Gl told reporters.      Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo?an recently issued a statement in which he expressed his concerns about the goals of Israel and questioned whether it is "the complete invasion of Palestine", and pointed out "If that is indeed the case, certainly there will be repercussions from the entire humanity. The children of Palestine are as valuable as those of Israel." Erdo?an criticized the Israeli counterattacks, stating that "While the kidnapping in Palestine was both negative and wrong, a tenfold use of excessive force is even more so. No reason can justify bombing civilians and laying waste to cities in a merciless manner." Erdo?an also mentioned that he got a phone call from Fuad Sinyora, the Prime Minister of Lebanon, where Sinyora explained to him that "they were being wrongfully accused of a crime they did not commit" and asked him to intervene in behalf of a cease-fire. "We are going to contribute in every way we can." Erdo?an told in his statement

Also don't think because you kiss a girl on the lips makes you a lesbian it doesn't, if you make out with them then yes it makes you one.

AA10673582	Yeah.  I've said it before here, but my baby is a miracle from God.  I'd been trying to get pregnant for 2 years.  (You're considered medically infertile after 1 year)  Some fellow believers gathered around to pray for me and my hubby and what do you know?  I got pregnant withing 2 weeks!  It wasn't a holy spirit impregnation like Mary, we did our part!  God definitely moved on our behalf to allow us to have a child.  Every day I look at my child's sweet face and am reminded of God's miracle working power!|`|AA10357195	yep there have been to many of those kind of things to mention|`|AA11055594	I felt God's hand in many situations; however, I do not consider myself a believer, rather, an agnostic. . . . .|`|AA10156454	Yes.  I applied for a Fellowship in the State Senate a few months ago and then had to go on an interview, but basically I just had to wait to find out if they picked me.  Waiting made me so nervous and worried!  Finally, I was listening to a Christian CD (the song was "I surrender all" by Clay Crosse) and I just said to God, "I surrender it all to you and will accept whatever is your will."    Then two days later they called and offered me the Fellowship.  I definately think God had something to do with it.|`|AA10897036	YES. God does everything for our good, for the best.

Its the small things too, that you are like I know this only could've happen if God was involved.|`|AA11896649	yes , it is what I like to call "the burning bush". I know God is working everyday in my life, and some things are more evident than others, and somethings i am willing to accept more than others.but the most obvious, I have seen is I was a stripper, cheated on my husband, he cheated on me, got diconnected from the church, used crystal meth., lost my house, my car, all material possesions, lost and kids and most of all lost myself......2 1/2 years later, I have been clean off meth., am hapily married to the same guy, have a home, 2 cars, my beautiful kids back, going to church, actually sing in the church choir, and most of all have myself back! Now if that is not something evident that He has put His hand in, I am not sure what is! He is awesome!!!!!!|`|AA10789965	yes i do...he has helped me thru many a situation..give thanks..|`|AA10072245	Yes.  God does things like that all of the time.

Hey God ! You out there listening? I could use some help down here.I don't want to do my part or what I am responsible for. Can you get me out of it.

It dealt with the rage/anger of Achilles in regards to death of his friend, Patroclus and then the revenge-killing of the Trojan Hero, Hector.  If you know the story of the Trojan War - then you know that Achilles will die via a poisoned arrow in the heel, that the Greeks will win by using the Trojan Horse, Any references to Aphrodite favoring Paris because he judged the contest of beauty between the top three goddesses - any mention of these things pre-date the current book.|`|YSGEaKIwaa	you do NOT what to know

If you're a straight man why would you want to have gay sex regardless of the money?  Surely that's something that would be too repulsive to contemplate.  So maybe so called 'straight men' do gay porn because of the money and then try and retain their masculinity by claiming to be straight.  When the truth of the situation is sexuality is something that has much less definition and therefore makes it all so much more exciting.|`|6d97c9aa6b7bec839573b464e44a9d8daa	Real Sex.|`|bafba0d7944b755f0f32244881386872aa	I asked my dad and he said gay.|`|AA11876129	Supposedly.

You know, Baptist people...|`|8408dc6d25926f2233876053b877c8b2aa	God knows who is capable and who is not capable of knowingly and honestly accepting what He is offering to all. For those of such diminshed mental capasity that they can not accept... they are inocent and will have a place with God in Heaven. I absolutly believe this to be true.    I absolutly believe that there are some with Downs that are very capable of acceting(perhaps at the child like level)  Jesus as their personal savior and can legitimatly claim the gift of God in their Salvation. There are no absolutes in determining mental capacity... And for all, regardless of mental capacity, it is only God, and each individual in his relationship with God,  who knows who is and who is not of The True Christian Faith.     Man must not judge who can or can not come to God... Man CAN NOT make that call.|`|AA11371881	no a retarded person would not,i repeat Not go 2 hell!they r pretty muck like a small child.God puts an age limit on how u feel 'bout God like a 6 year old won't get anything 'bout.if someone had a brain like that it'd b the same 4 that person!|`|AA11712589	If he has Down's Syndrome, then every day is hell I'm sure.|`|af74d67a19fcb11578cb0fd97f94bde3aa	An all loving God gives everyone an opportunity to know Him and a choice to accept him or not.

I have known people with downs syndrome that did accept Jesus as their savior.   I do not think IQ has anything to do with accepting Christ.  If God was fair and we all got what we deserved, we would all go to hell.  All have sinned.  Yet going beyond what is "fair"  God does give us Christ, his blood covers our sin.

That's it.  No salvation...no real knowledge. practicians believe that if they get really good at lighting candles of diferent color and drawing circles on the floor....they'll be able to make it rain on a sunny day and make people fall in love with them. It's all about power....  And i would like to insist on the idea that they should not be underestimated. the ones that have been doing this for a long time and actually got preety good, can tie someones luck in 1 min or less. i know that people like that can harm you, curse you etc. But to answer your question.....the purpose is power.        I would like to add that some look to wicca and peganism in a search for good, obtaining the power to heal and protect. Most start that way, but they get lost in all those spells.|`|AA11942115	errr. wicca's are pretty much a "witch religion". they cast spells on people for personal gain or to hinder them in some aspect. i use to know one , and she was pretty scary....|`|AA10618986	wicca is different to each person. there is the respect of nature and the spirits and then there are just people who are looking for something different.

I am having trouble praying to someone I cant see, confessed a young woman. Since no human has seen God, we need faith in order to pray and to be heard by God. We need to believe that Jehovah really exists and that he can do what we ask. (Hebrews 11:6) If we have that kind of faith, and if we approach God with a sincere heart, we can be sure that he will help us. (Mark 9:23) Thus, even though the Roman army officer Cornelius was not at the time part of Gods organization, when he sincerely prayed for guidance, God answered his prayer.Acts 10:30-33.  Some persons have a hard time expressing themselves in words. However, this should not keep them from speaking to God in prayer. We can be sure that he knows our needs and will understand what we want to say. (Matthew 6:8) Think about it: Which expression do you most appreciate from a childhis simple, sincere thanks or the special words someone told him to say? Our Father in heaven likewise appreciates simple, sincere expressions from us. (James 4:6; Luke 18:9-14) No special words or religious language are needed. He will not even listen to those who pray in unusual or high-sounding language to impress others, or who say the same things over and over again in an insincere way.Matthew 6:5,?7.  Even when you pray silently, God can hear. When Nehemiah did, God acted upon his sincere request, and likewise with Hannah. (Nehemiah 2:4-8; 1?Samuel 1:11-13,?19,?20) Nor is a persons physical position when praying the important thing. You can pray while in any position, at any time and at any place. However, the Bible shows that a position of humility, such as bowing the head or kneeling, is appropriate. (1?Kings 8:54; Nehemiah 8:6; Daniel 6:10; Mark 11:25; John 11:41) And Jesus indicated that it is good when personal prayers can be said in a place of privacy, unseen to men.Matthew 6:6.  Prayer is part of our worship. For this reason our prayers should be addressed only to our Creator, Jehovah God, not to anyone else. (Matthew 4:10) And the Bible shows that Christians must approach God through Jesus, who gave his life to take away our sins. This means we should say our prayers in the name of Jesus.John 14:6,?14; 16:23; Ephesians 5:20; 1?John 2:1,?2.  However, are all prayers pleasing to Jehovah? The Bible says: He that is turning his ear away from hearing the laweven his prayer is something detestable. (Proverbs 28:9; 15:29; Isaiah 1:15) Therefore if we want God to hear our prayers, a basic requirement is that we do his will, that we obey his laws. Otherwise God will not listen to us, just as an upright person would not listen to a radio program that he considers immoral. The Bible says: Whatever we ask we receive from him, because we are observing his commandments and are doing the things that are pleasing in his eyes.1?John 3:22.  This means that we must work at what we pray for. For example, it would be wrong for a person to ask God for his help to stop using tobacco or marijuana and then go out and buy these things. Nor could he ask Jehovah to help him to avoid immorality and then read literature and watch movies and television programs that feature immorality. Or if gambling is a persons weakness, he could not pray for God to help him to stop and then visit racetracks or other such places where gambling is carried on. For our prayers to be heard by God, we need to show him by our actions that we really mean what we say.  What, then, are personal things that we can include in our prayers to Jehovah? Actually, anything that will affect our relationship with God is a proper subject for prayer, including our physical health, as well as the rearing of children. (2?Kings 20:1-3; Judges 13:8) The apostle John wrote: No matter what it is that we ask according to his will, he hears us. (1?John 5:14) So the important thing is that our requests be in harmony with Gods will. This means that we first need to learn what his will is. (Proverbs 3:5,?6) Then if we take into consideration Gods will and purpose when we pray, rather than simply being concerned with our own personal interests, our prayers will be acceptable to Jehovah. It is proper that we thank Jehovah every day for the good things he provides.John 6:11,?23; Acts 14:16,?17.  Jesus gave his followers a model prayer to guide them as to the kind of prayer God accepts. (Matthew 6:9-13) This prayer shows that Gods name, his kingdom and the doing of his will on earth come first. Next, we may ask for our personal needs, such as our daily food, the forgiveness of sins, and the deliverance from temptation and from the wicked one, Satan the Devil.|`|K3PR7Mivaa	do u mean with sincerity? I think so. God says not to repeat vain repetitions, God is Good God is Great....  as many adults even say, without really emotions and thankfulness behind it, Also people pray quick general prayers and feel good that they said anything at all. I think the Bible teaches that God desires fellowship with us and wants us to share every good, bad, sad, worry, joy, care we could possible have. He also says to come before Him with supplications and thanksgiving, important to call out to the mighty God you serve, sharing His word with Him, that states His promises He's made. It also says to pray to the Father, through the Jesus name, meaning Gods gonna answer because of Christ in us, He intercedes for us, and we're suppose to pray with the Holy Spirit guidance asking for God to have His will in the situation. God knows all about us, our needs and wants, fully able to supply each one, but desires us to come before Him, humbling ourselves with confessions of our sins asking Him to cleanse and restore us.. Thankfully we have the Holy Spirit on our behalf that knows our souls deepest uttering and groaning, making supplication for us when we don't even know what we need. God answers Prayer just not always the way you want or expect, but ultimately it will give Him Glory and draw others to Him.

We are all told to do this, so even if you have no question for me, please make sure that you go directly to the source.      He says that if you seek you will find, ask and it will be given to you.  The mystery of the church is a mystery that mankind cannot understand unless they are seeking the truth, not for profit or for the sake of argument, but to know and understand the Truth.  If you seek Him and you ask Him, you will find Him.  I will pray for you that you find who or what you seek.

But can the Sharia or the bible, or the torrah be changed, even though many of their dictats are increasingly loosing context and meaning in todays society? A sharia will transport us back into the 6th century arabia, while the biblical laws will take us back to the inquisitions and crusades.     Why go there at all. I dont think  that any religion based law is better at this point in time.

It seems as if evolution makes sense because there are real life examples and it is not dictated by tradition and faith.  It's relatively new and still holding ground.    Because it's more scientifically plausible it should be taught in classrooms but I.D. should be encouraged in churches as it may just be seen as more likely one day.  Since I.D. is generally defended by those in churches rather than in the scientific community it might be best to have it remain in churches and only taught to those who are interested in learning it.     Don't get uppity, though.  The secret to sucessful science is an open mind.|`|049c6b6806d9c3601e3b73f277b3a0c7aa	Intelligent design, and actual facts, When it comes to reality  nobody wants to really know.

Not proven "science".  There is no error regarding the reference to "creation" recorded in the Bible. Only a lot of people misrepresenting that record with   dogmatic and unreasonable doctrine/interpretation.  If you actually read what the Bible does and doesn't say, you will find that it totally agrees with proven scientific study.

jurKacxdaa	Generally, they just have a different belief system.  Their experience of the world allows them to interpret things differently than I do.  I congratulate them on their faith, while at the same time I am unable to understand their positions.  Although, admittedly, on Y!A there seems to be a plethora of intellectually stunted individuals on both sides of the belief wall.  I don't judge all believers based on the wackos who feel the need to bludgeon us with mindless Q/A, as I would hope the enlightened believer would not judge me based on the same.  |`|mm7u00AJaa	I am not an atheist exactly (more of an agnostic,  but I don't like to categorize myself) but I feel that intellect has little to do with religious belief or non-belief. Some atheists probably believe that religious individuals are naive or ignorant because they don't accept the same beliefs in science, etc, but certainly not all atheists believe that they're intellectually superior to all religious individuals. I don't personally associate with any religion (although I am fascinated by them) at this point in my life, but I would not call myself an atheist. But to each his/her own; as long as a person doesn't follow a religion to such lengths as they are doing harm (physical, verbal, emotion, psychological, social, cultural, whatever type) to themselves or others, than they should have faith in whatever it is they chose. I think people can become blinded to fact by their religion, however. For example, the most stringent fundamentalist Christians may not believe in evolution and only believe in creationism. They might refuse to compromise belief and fact, and accept evolution as valid. Religious individuals can be ignorant when they only see in black and white. But so can atheists.|`|Y7NIr4btaa	I don't feel that religious individuals are inferior intellectually, no, but I can't help but feel that they haven't fully addressed the issue.<br>  <br>  I know that that sounds arrogant, but as someone who had a strong belief for many years I do believe that true investigation into the truth of our own place in the universe can't help but yield the answer that there is almost certainly not a god, and that we do not survive death.<br>  <br>  I think that I would have more respect for somebody who has a clear understanding of the atheist perspective and has come to a religious belief through a truly logical progression of thought than somebody who just believes whatever they are told and refuses to listen to reason.<br>  <br>  Having travelled much of the world I have seen people of all religions who have allowed their own beliefs in the afterlife to be based upon their culture, rather than on self-discovery. This makes little sense to me, as somebody who is an adamant believer in Allah would probably have been a believer in Jehovah if they'd been born in a different country.<br>  <br>  Somebody who embraces a religion which they were not born into and which is not endemic to their country of birth, and who can see which parts of their religion are dogma and therefore not applicable, is somebody who I would consider worthy of respect.|`|QD6xRO7jaa	I find that I am often more intelligent than believers.<br>  <br>  And, as an Agnostic I also feel I have a better perspective on faith and religion that Atheists.<br>  <br>  After all, an Atheist must have faith that there is no God just as a believer must have faith that there is.<br>  <br>  What we Agnostics say is that we do not know.<br>  <br>  And that is the only provable position of the three.|`|k7VcOIb0aa	I believe I am better because I have taken my time out to question the existence of other religions co-existing with my own(or what used to be mine). If you don't take your time out to question other religions but your own, you're just being a hypocrite. When you do find out what all other religions are about and the steps they all take, its pretty simple why religion rules the masses. and when you question the FIRST ever religion, you will become an atheist yourself.|`|ewyewsIxaa	I go on 8 hour bus rides to vermont and sometimes the topic of religon comes up.

MeMhVugsaa	W'salaam    It depends on the religion of the people getting married....if it is a Hindu bengali marriage, or a muslim one....im assuming its a muslim bengali marriage..well things like the seating arrangements, entertainment and how the whole wedding is proceeded depends on how religiously they carry out the wedding.     just like some pakistani people who are more conservative, will have the mens and womens section seperately, same goes for bengalis.     others who do not really have the wedding the proper islamic way will have a lot of singing, dancing, (men and women) etc etc. so it all depends on the religiousity of the wedding procedure.     if you know the family to be quite religious, expect to be seated in different halls. women in one hall with the bride whilst men in another with the groom.     usually around the end, the bride and grrom are bought together on one stage, to exchange garlands of flowers, feed each other sweets and drinking milk, and then all their relatives etc come and give them 'salaami' which is when people go up to the stage, meet and get introduced to the bride or the groom...give their blessings, say a few words and give them money in a thing on the table, to help them get started on their new life. =)))...    sInce you are pakistani, you wont find it very different, wear desi clothes, and since its a desi wedding, its acceptable to go OVERBOARD with the bright colors and jewelry...LOL....most of all...remember to ENJOY yourself!!! =))))))))))) xD    EDIT: theres usually a part in the wedding where a religious guy come and reads a prayer, gives a talk, and everyone does du'a for the bride and groom, they are bothe asked if they are happy and accept the marriage and say 'kabul'...lol    there are other cultural things that happen, for example, the brides sisters etc stealing the grooms shoes...(it ALWAYS happens)....an aunty or uncle who trys to be clever and keeps moving the spoon when feeding the groom....and at the entrance, before the grooms side comes in, theres a ribbon barrier, which the brides side put up, and insist they wont let the grooms people in if they dont pay up!!!!..its all the in the name of fun...(and a chance to make good bucks...hahahhh)....but yh....they argue and negotiate the price...and the ribbon is finally cut and the groom is allowed to enter....    for the lunch/dinner, expect starters, usually kebabs, samosas, chicken tikka etc etc....main course: pilaou, rices,currys, tandoori etc, n dessert: finni, mishti, sweets, fruits etc etc...|`|R0iHHPqEaa	idk|`|JiaGiVexaa	I've been to 3 Bengali weddings and we all sat together in our reserved table.

mfSp38yzaa	It means he's Irish and Catholic. Does he HAVE to marry a Catholic? No. But to be married in the Catholic Church, he and his fiance would have to go through counseling, usually with the Pastor, and agree that any children born of the marriage would be raised Catholic.    Personally, I think it's much more difficult, if you are active in your Church, to be with someone who doesn't agree with your beliefs; but he can marry anyone he wants.

The term is of note due to Irish immigration to many countries of the English speaking world, particularly as a result of the Irish Famine in the 1840s - 1850s, following which the population declined by over half in the following century (from approx. over 8 million to just over 4 million) due to the pattern of immigration begun then. The term has currency in Great Britain, the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Some of these nations had, or have, a majority of Protestants; thus, both aspects - being Catholic, and being Irish - at times separated them from the mainstream culture. In the United States, hostility to both these aspects was expressed through the Know-Nothing movement and Nativism in general.    The term can also relate to a period when Catholicism in Ireland was somewhat divergent from the "Roman" church. Though mostly reconciled with the Synod of Cashel in 1172, some elements unique within the practice of Catholicism and Catholic culture remained in Ireland.    'Irish Catholic' is also used to distinguish Catholic inhabitants of Ireland from the Ulster-Scots and the Anglo-Irish, and the North American descendants of Irish Catholic emigrants from the Scots-Irish. It does not necessarily refer to religion, as there are many Irish Catholics who belong to other faiths or, indeed, no faith at all (such as Eamonn McCann).    The Irish Catholic is also the name of a popular newspaper in Ireland published for lay people.|`|FnE7BiYJaa	From my Irish Catholic friend there seems to be a political side to this.

AA11674755	Like you said, some countries think that women with a little "meat" on their bones are more attractive.  Many American men find large women attractive. Some women carry it to extremes by using drugs, and fast weight loss programs to loose weight. Doctors have preached to us for years that the best way to keep our weight in balance is to eat right, and exercise, but we don't listen. Instead we break down our bodies and poison them with chemicals and drugs to keep our teenage figure.   All the famous painters portray the women as having meat on their bones.  Society today is to obsessed with what we should look like instead of what kind of person we are.  And you mentioned Barbie?

AA11124607	girls definitely are growing up too quickly and you are definitely not the only one noticing this. look at myspace, where so many girls who clearly have not even celebrated their sweet sixteenth birthday yet happily post pictures of themselves half-naked. it's disgusting, it's almost like seeing a younger sister dressing up as a prostitute, thinking she's drop-dead gorgeous. also, go into any store like hollister, and a lot of the clothes are unbelievably tight. and girls enjoy that. and then there's that whole make-up issue. i mean, why on earth would a thirteen year old need to paint her face? i think that children are mostly motivated by what they see on t.v., and thus their perception on what is "cute" is a bit distorted. there's also their desire to seem mature, which is a bit ironic, because adults want to be young. children don't realize what so many people would give to be their age again. i'm afraid about how these very girls, girls with no sense of their own beauty, girls who fall for what they see on t.v. so easily, girls who believe everything they do should be to get a boyfriend, are going to be when they get older. and what's even more sickening are these parents who encourage it and think they're "cool" by doing so.|`|707ae119ab0610122de6b0b1c8c3fc04aa	I agree, I'm 15, and it even bothers ME! my cousin was in 4th grade when I met her, and was talking about how she wanted to lose her virginity, it scared me.|`|AA11028702	Yeah, a lot of girls want to be women before they know what life is all about.

I am of your generation and I remember wearing leggings and a big t-shirt that would sit off of one shoulder, sometimes a tank-top underneath to look like a bra, in elementary school. That is what the older kids wore then, but it just seems ugly now. So what is skanky for young kids to be wearing now is just them copying the skanky-dressing celebrities of the modern day. One day they'll look back and say, "ewe, what were we thinking", like we do now.|`|ad425fae3ed5451339160d61bb78f61faa	yes I'm 14 and i have had to grow up fast until a little wile  ago i thought the girls in my grade were incessant but boy was i wrong|`|af74d67a19fcb11578cb0fd97f94bde3aa	Some parents allow their girls to dress inappropriately, some girls sneak out.  Girls do seem to grow up too quickly.  Dressing like a skank is not a sign of maturity and could get a girl involved in behavior she is not ready for.|`|97cf97f56753c72156e3279d073e970faa	It is scary how quickly girls are growing up these days...that's why I'm glad I have boys. (of course one day my sweet little boys will be dating these over-sexed lolitas).  I think all kids watch too much tv, and want so badly to be like the women they see in the movies, music videos, etc.  I also think that a lot of parents are afraid to say no to their kids.  To a lot of parents it's just as important for their kids to be "cool" as it is to the kids.  Our priorities are completely out of whack and I'm surprised that the jump in teen pregnancies, and the media coverage of all of these little girls getting kidnapped raped and murdered hasn't woken people up to the fact.  Kids are kids they want what all the other kids have and want to do what everyone else is doing, but they also need to be reminded that they are just kids, they are vulnerable, they are not invincible.  That's what parents are for.  To me, being a little overprotective isn't such a bad thing.|`|f95cf38e37d23c9da9265d7270a689aeaa	I have to agree. My sister is 12, and she acts the way I did a year ago. Girls are blowing lines of coke and losing their virginity at the ages of 11-13. It's sick.|`|AA12340086	Trust me, your not the only one that's noticed.  They are definatly more "mature" then I remember, and I'm under 25 as well.

Actually I have no idea the cause but....yeah.....|`|AA11624244	I can kinda agree with what you're saying about the clothing that teens choose to wear nowadays. However there are a lot of teens that are forced to mature faster than others due to the living conditions they're in. Not all teens have much of a choice when it comes to growing up. I, for one, was forced to mature faster than most girls my age. I was cooking by the time I was 12 and taking care of the house and my sisters while my mother was away at work trying to make ends meet. With no father around it was hard and I was forced to grow up twice as fast as my friends. Although, this was the case, I do not, nor have I ever dressed innapropriately, but I guess some girls have different taste.  I am still young (19 years), but I can understand part of the reasons why they do that, but then there are some girls who just overdo it and then comes the stereotype that young girls are ALL trying to be grown when thats not the case at all. SOME girls are trying too hard to be grown, but then there are girls like me who were forced to take care of themselves at young ages and therefore have independent attitudes.|`|dd3d20a2bb00789f5b9c4dd6b6a0df05aa	I think it has a lot to do with how pop culture sexualizes children.  It is often used as a marketing tool. I'm in my 40's and can't believe the stuff that kids know and are exposed to.  Yes, I do notice. It's not your imagination.  No, not ALL parents notice, because not all children are being raised by their parents. Some are neglectful. And not all parents are buying these clothes for their kids. Sometimes kids borrow clothes from each other, buy them from gift money or allowance, etc. Personally, my parents took notice at everything I wore when I was a kid.  Another issue is that hormones are in a lot of our foods. There are studies that directly relate food consumption to early development in girls.|`|5fb8b8124b09ee2e5ccee164644254d5aa	I agree and I am 20.  I work at a retail store in the LITTLE girls department and I see girls about 8-11 looking "grown-up" but I also noticed that their moms are still buying their clothes in the teen section.  It is sad to see these moms that look like they have spent a year straight in the tanning bed and then hopped out of it to color their hair and put on a skirt that only covers half of their butt cheeks.  No wonder their daughters are starting so young to be the same way.
e599048e233e3acf23cf48401068af4daa	I am Welsh.  Welsh accents make me think of my country, beautiful coastlines,rugby, daffodils, mountains and cawl(broth). Irish accents are lovely (but not Ulster) they make me think of romance and a certain kind of wildness. Scottish accents make me think of kilts, bagpipes, haggis . whiskey and mist over lakes amidst stunning scenery.  English accents are very varied depending on what part of the country one is in.  For instance, Yorkshire and Lancashire accents make me think of puddings and the War of the Roses. I tend to think that "proper" English spoken mostly in the South East of England, does not have an accent as such. It is just English.

d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	If evil exists. You only know that it does from your perspective. I'm an atheist, but the argument from evil fails. Augustine made a perfectly sound argument fro evil simply being the lack of good, like a wound being a lack of flesh. This is why no Abrahamic theology says there is an absolutely evil being.    Better to play the "omnis" against one another. For instance, can God create a being that knows more than he does?|`|0yPfYLEFaa	According to most on here, morality is completely subjective. So does evil even exist in reality, according to those who have no belief in moral absolutes?|`|jRcdbna5aa	It's true.

So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD.|`|EAix5Av9aa	God has the final say in all matters.   You are not the age of Christ reigning as yet.   In fact God does all that in spite of distorted info you propogate.   Abraham believed God and it was counted as righteousness.    So in  Christ dispensation of grace ... God gives forgiveness and that is more important than other events of satans doings in the world.   Why should we enjoined to the devils mischief.? Why do you think God allows for thingsto be as they are?   If we have unbelief that overwhelms us then why is that unrighteousness.    Your version of God is one of heaven now!  You are in the wrong era.    Why do unbelievers covet believers?    Why is false doctrine in the world and laws that accept sin,hypocrocy,covetousness and robbery of believers liberty?|`|akwVAZcEaa	It's Satan's plan to try and blame God for everything that goes 'bad' in the world when, in fact, it was God who originally made the world as an Edenic Paradise, with man and woman in His own likeness.  Satan causes the problems - God simply allows him to do so, and the reason is this:- If God simply and swiftly wiped Satan out (which He could do if He wanted to) then God would be seen as angry, vindictive and Someone to be terrified of (which is what Satan wants)!     But God is "love" and only fights Satan with love - by giving Satan enough time and rope to show his real and rotten colors for everyone to see and adjudge for themselves.     Yes, God IS all-powerful - He COULD stop evil but, by doing so, we would never realize how bad evil is, how bad Satan is or how bad sin is.  Yes, He IS all-knowing - It is WE who are ignorant of God's great Master Plan of salvation.  Yes, He IS all-loving - He even allows wicked and loveless ones, like Satan, to mess things up for the sake of those who love God to turn away from such evils and to be saved.  As for God being "immoral" - If your parents told you not to do "evil" things (i.e. random sex; drugs, theft, etc) as a "test" to be a better person, would that be "immoral" or "loving"?  "Why doesn't God stop it?" - Because He is giving us time to decide whose side we're on (Joshua 24:15 "Choose you, this day, whom you will serve").|`|eAMq1iBWaa	God created evil and He will subdue it completely one day      45:7 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the LORD do all these [things].

HZqi9XyJaa	Yes.  Pork is still unclean. It is an extremely filthy, unhealthy animal to eat.     The distinction of clean and unclean foods were originally made all the way back in the book of Genesis with Noah, before Jews.  They were just repeated in Leviticus 11 and were just described in more detail.  So these food laws were meant for everyone. And they were never changed.... People have thought it is now ok to eat because of mis-interpretation of scripture....    The verse where it says not that which goes into the mouth defiles a man, but that which comes out of the mouth,this defiles a man has nothing to do with unclean foods, if people read the entire section in context the Pharisees were telling them they were defiled because they did not wash their hands before breaking bread.    The verses in Acts where Peter see's a sheet come down showing unclean animals and saying they are clean isn't literal. If they read further it explains those verses, it actually says it wasn't talking about the animals literally, it was talking about the Gentiles (who were originally considered unclean). Once Stephen was stoned the Gospel was taken to the Gentiles. God was telling Peter that they are no longer to be considered unclean anymore. It refers to PEOPLE, not animals. The animals in the vision were just used as an example.    The verse that says everything God has created is good, and no food is to 'be rejected, provided if is received with thanksgiving: the word of God and prayer make it holy.... By examining this passage in its overall context, Paul was countering a false teaching by saying that it is permissible to eat animal flesh as long as the meats were approved in the word of God. Paul was addressing the subject of enforced vegetarianism, not the subject of "unclean meats."     Pork is still an un-healthy, un-clean animal. God didn't change the animal and he didn't just change His mind about them.|`|E9chZY74aa	Nope.|`|2d2ZuimCaa	It was a unclean animal in the Old testament .  Timothy 4:4 " For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:  5  For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer."|`|9mLjDa5kaa	Jesus said we are to eat anything we want.

However, the New Testament abolishes those old laws. But this is why Jews still abstain from pork.|`|s8QbZ0RLaa	I think it's actually in the Old Testament. Christians also use the New Testament where pork is allowed I believe. Jews don't eat pork because they only use the Old Testament.|`|AA10241737	Pork was forbidden because of trichinosis, a disease people got from eating tainted pork.

All religious prohibitions need to be ignored, as well as religion for that matter.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	No it is not forbidden for Christians to eat pork.

How about you?" or even the more straight-forward, "Let's go to X Restaurant on Sunday."

All will be judged and all will have an opportunity to believe or not to believe.  The question comes down to what will you choose?    And it's not God's punishment that is sending people away from Him...that falls on each individual.  Everyone has an opportunity to believe at some point...and if you don't believe, that's not God's fault, that's your own.    I also don't believe in the "fire and brimstone" of a Hell/Hades.    Hope this helps!  Good luck, and may God continue to shine on you.  -Shalom|`|QOWA80Yiaa	it is good you humble. He is like a normal parent.

God is more than girlfriend.  It's even more than your parents, children and wife/husband.  The answer is God does love humans very much as how your parents love you but more.  He sees humans have failed him and he is very upset but he also cannot violate his own rules when saving humans.  Similar to your parents love you so much that if you failed, they are very sorry for you and will try anything legal to help you to succeed.  If you failed, the punishment not only goes to you but also you parents.  Another analogy is if you work hard, you succeed.  If you have not and never put effort and not willing to find alternative solutions, you failed.  To me it's cause and effect.  You create your own punishment as the consequences from your previous deeds (sins), but your failures (sins) also hurt God's feeling.    No matter what kind of astrophysics theories such as M-Theory, String Theory, etc these are only to explain the mechanics of how it works, but never able to explain the meaning of our existence.   Those missionaries are the messengers to "advertise" how and why the system works through the love of God and what's best for other people.    Since God has created the entire universe, you can treat the universe as part of a system that is designed by him which has to follow his sets of rules.  Therefore God is the justice.  Based on his system, if you have sinned, the result is death.  If you are absolutely perfect and have not sinned, you live.     From the Bible, it's the war between the God and Satan.  Satan wants to obtain God's power and he believes that humans can rule themselves without the relationship of God.  Satan has to prove himself correct, but God knows the system too well and does not agree with Satan because base on the system, anyone that doesn't believe in God has committed sin, and result in death, so does Satan.  In order to prove Satan wrong, God has to allow Satan to stay in the system to let Satan realizes his wrong doings and a chance for Satan to redeem his mistakes and follow God.  However, Satan doesn't admit his wrong doings and uses all kinds of strategies to have humans commit sins to follow him instead of God.  God has his master plan to fix this mess while keeping Satan in the system for strategic purposes.    Since all humans have sins, based on God's system, every human has to die.  Because God loves humans so much that he must need to find the perfect way to save humans while maintaining humans' free will.  So what can he do to save the humans without modifying his perfectly designed system?  God has to engineer a plan to trick Satan from knowing it.      The initial illusion to Satan is that God accepted human redemption only through sacrifice or an authorized priest.  From the Old Testament, when people sinned, they could sacrifice an animal or confess to the priest for redemption.  But God's ultimate plan to save humans is to have a perfect human as a sacrifice.  This perfect human is Jesus.  Jesus was to be sacrificed for the humans' sins.  Satan did not fully understand the purpose of God, so he tried very hard to interfere Jesus to commit sins, but failed.  But Satan probably did not realize that it's a trap from God, it's a lose-lose situation.  After failing to lead Jesus to commit sins, Satan interfered the humans to kill Jesus.  Satan thought killing Jesus could stop God from saving humans.  However, by killing a perfect human being, that's actually fulfilling the master plan of God by sacrificing a being in order to reopen the gate to the heaven for humans.  Jesus not only opened the heaven's gate but also proved that humans can be revived if he/she has not sinned.  From the Bible the moment right before Jesus died, he was also being "tricked" by God.  Because Jesus said "Why did Father abandon me?" before his last breath.  Jesus even until the last moment did not realize that God really abandoned him for a purpose in order to force him to enter into another realm to probably save more dead people.  So Jesus is the true savior of humans for all time periods.  His sacrifice becomes the ultimate weapon against Satan.  It is still the same sacrificing system from the Old Testament, but the subject being sacrificed is a perfect human being. Which changes the procedure of how humans can be saved.  As long as humans believe in Jesus' sacrifice sincerely, they will eventually follow the God's will which grant them eternal life    At the end do you think Satan can be saved if he finally believed in Jesus?  Because Satan is not human but an Angle and Jesus is also God, which means God sacrificed himself to save higher beings including Angels too.  So Jesus not only save humans but also angels?  Correct me if I'm wrong.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	He punishes no one. He simply offers salvation and if you refuse this gift then there is only one alternative.    Eze 33:11 Say unto them, [As] I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways; for why will ye die?        Why die when you can live forever, mate?    It's a real no-brainer....    You go on a cruise and fall overboard. Someone throws you a life preserver and you push it away because you'd rather drown.

dCewrtXaaa	It is not the size or color of eyes or the lashes surrounding them that make for "bedroom eyes."

It is a term usually used by men who would like to get you into bed.|`|2v9O45xMaa	The idea is that the eyes seem to be signalling "come to bed" - so they are seen as a sexual invitation.

There's almost as much work in figuring out a job as actually turning on the saw and doing it - but I don't get paid to figure the job out - only for doing it.      So anyway, years ago I just made up my mind that the job is important and fun - if I get paid for it - so much the better.  But I never think of money when I do a job.  And whatever money comes at the end is just fine (unless I really screw up ruin a lot of materials or something - then I get to pay for the job).|`|qoKvIsBYaa	I work because we have a three year old and I want her no have everything I never had and always wanted.

I would never be able to stay at home and do nothing every day, so I plan on adding to my volunteer work.

You might find you change your mind later anyway. I mean, I love my boyfriend and we're moving in together, but there's no way I want kids- but I know I might feel differently in a few years. As long as both partners know the situation and they;;re both okay with it I don't see the problem.    If the only purpose of marriage is to have a family, that's not very fair on those who can't have kids is it? Especially if there's that whole thing of sex for procreation only (ugh, how boring!).    I think once you meet that person you actually want to spend your life with, most of these worries will go away on their own :)|`|KrdOKdJcaa	No. The purpose of marriage is to commit to being with someone and have a life with them. Yes, children are often a byproduct, but they are not required. You have every right to get married and not start a family.|`|8D9pAEAbaa	Do it for sex. If the kids get 2 much dump them in a foster home.|`|t88527U1aa	Are you a Christian is first question? If you are Children are a gift of God if you choose not to have them is this what God asks of you.If it is then do not No one can answer this for you! If you believe and are having sex outside of Marriage you are correct its sin. if you have someone you want to marry and you discuss it the other person too does not want children. you'll be ok,Be honest with them tell them you want Marriage but no kids. Do not marry hoping to clear this up later. Its a huge decision!|`|da1dcaeaa6d5a578338ee81a7e6ea26faa	this is Pauls opnion...not Gods instruction......     1Cr 7:8 But I say to the unmarried and to widows that it is good for them if they remain even as I(unmarried). But if they do not have self-control, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to burn {with passion.}  But to the married I give instructions, not I, but the Lord, that the wife should not leave her husband.    In this passage paul is saying that it is better to stay unmarried, but if sex is to much of a temptation, then it is better to be married. he doesn't say anywhere about having children.    This is the Bibles description of a WORTHY WOMAN  proverbs 31:10  An excellent wife, who can find? For her worth is far above jewels.    The heart of her husband trusts in her, And he will have no lack of gain.   She does him good and not evil All the days of her life.    She looks for wool and flax And works with her hands in delight.    She is like merchant ships; She brings her food from afar.   She rises also while it is still night And gives food to her household And portions to her maidens.   She considers a field and buys it; From her earnings she plants a vineyard.    She girds herself with strength And makes her arms strong.   She senses that her gain is good; Her lamp does not go out at night.   She stretches out her hands to the distaff, And her hands grasp the spindle.    She extends her hand to the poor, And she stretches out her hands to the needy.    She is not afraid of the snow for her household, For all her household are clothed with scarlet.      She makes coverings for herself; Her clothing is fine linen and purple.Her husband is known in the gates, When he sits among the elders of the land.     She makes linen garments and sells {them,} And supplies belts to the tradesmen. Strength and dignity are her clothing, And she smiles at the future.      She opens her mouth in wisdom, And the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. She looks well to the ways of her household, And does not eat the bread of idleness.     Her children rise up and bless her; Her husband {also,} and he praises her, {saying:} "Many daughters have done nobly, But you excel them all."  Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, {But} a woman who fears the LORD, she shall be praised. Give her the product of her hands, And let her works praise her in the gates.        while it does talk of children , it doesnt say she HAS to have any in order to be a worthy wife.    I know its a long explination, but i wanted to back up my answer.

AA10674998	God has a drive to love you.     Think of your strongest urge and multiply that by 10000% and then some and you might get close to describing His drive. It is massive and impossible to quantify. His drive is for you.    A friend met with a family that had a special needs boy. The fella was autistic and obsessive compulsive about frogs. From the time that Mike, my friend, met with the family, the young boy only talked about frogs. That is all he would talk about. Finally, Mike asked the family if he could take the boy to the park or something to see if there was any frogs around. Agreeable to Mike's idea, they arrived at the park and could hardly slow the car down before the boy bolted from the door and sprinted like an Olympian over the hill and beyond Mike's view. Mike was concerned that he would not find the child.    Soon enough, he caught up and saw that he boy made a small bridge across a shallow creek and had laid on the bridge to reach down and catch a frog. The frog seemed to put up with it and stayed still as the boy examined it carefully. After a long while of looking, the boy stood up and galloped back to the car. Well, Mike shrugged his shoulders and headed back, too. They went home and without a word the boy had retired to his room to do something.    A few minutes later, Mike saw the boy emerge with a drawing. It looked like a photo, but the frog-obsessed boy made a wonderful illustration of the exact frog that he saw at the park. Like I said, it looked like a photo.    How much more do you think God obsesses about you? He could draw you perfectly blindfolded. After all He crafted you in delicate flesh in the womb of your mother! He studies you with His full attention to the point that He has the hairs on your head numbered. He might even have names for each of your hairs. Think about it ... He is crazy about you!        Mt 10:30      "But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."    God is waaaay obsessed with you.    Now think about it.   Do you think that He just stood there trying to decide if He wanted to have a realtionship with Him when I asked Him that?!?! NO WAY! He was in like a rocket, because He had been waiting for that chance my whole life.     He is more in love with you each day. He is so glad that He died on the cross to have you and hold you. To Him it was a bargain!    Is there a greater sacrifice for God than Christ Jesus the Lord at Calvary?    I can think of something that is too great a sacrifice for God and one thing He just won't let happen, even if it costs Him more than His life.    That greater sacrifice is to live without you, and without Him being able to have you and hold you and fulfill all your desires in Him for all eternity. That was the real sacrifice and God would not let it happen, so instead of living without you, He sent His only begotten to die so that you would be with Him for eternity. Yeah, I think it is safe to say that you are going to be with Him as it is written in scriptures. That is a certainty for all those who have truly repented and called out to Him for salvation.    Yes, I know you stumble. I know I do, too. I have shortcomings that I wish would go away, so that I didn't have to struggle anymore, but that is all a good sign. At least we "wish" and "struggle" against the things that weigh us down. At least we are concerned about the things and attitudes that we have that aren't yet perfect. That is part of revealing what He has given us. We have been given a solution to all our deficiencies and now our deficiencies no longer fit and we are no longer comfortable with them. It reveals that a change has happened, that could never be reversed.        Salvation is Given and Must Be Received...Once Received, Forever Shall It Belong to the Redeemed      From Letters From God and His Christ         6/19/07 - From Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ - A Letter Given to Timothy, For All Those Who Have Ears to Hear        Question asked by Timothy for a brother in Christ: Lord, can our salvation be lost?        Answer from Jesus Christ, Our Lord and Savior:        Timothy, write as I speak, and hear My word and give Me glory. For in My word is glory, even the truth, of which no man can change. For if any man changes that which I have spoken, to his own glory, or in the serving of the evil one, even that man shall I destroy.        So then, you have come before Me asking on your brothers behalf, though he asks in the testing of you, holding you up against his own belief and according to that doctrine of which he has already accepted. Yet I have spoken and will speak for the sake of your asking, and for the edification of him you call friend and brother. For he is My son also, though he does not yet believe that you are who you claim to be. And for this reason, I also have had you write My own word spoken, so for surety, he may know and understand that salvation gained is assured.    For it is not by gain that you have acquired it. Rather, it is by grace...the gift of the Father ransomed by the blood of the Son. So then, all those of which the Father has given Me, I shall not lose one. For all who come to Me, in no wise shall I cast out. Yet there are those among you, who say it is written by the prophet, that to those who are righteous, who turn from their righteousness and do wickedly, even for this shall the Father remember their righteous deeds no more; and for their wickedness, they shall surely die. This saying is true and was spoken to His prophet of old time, according to the Old Covenant, and should be taken to heart. Yet understand this, you scholars and those without understanding, you lack faith and do not know your God, nor that covenant written in blood as an Everlasting and New Covenant. I died...behold, I am risen...and I live forever...amen. An|`|q2KfJ4JDaa	Don't be scared of life & death. There is no sky daddy and god doesn't exist.

The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|eAMq1iBWaa	He DIED for us. And He calls us friends!|`|yvRD6nDgaa	Yes he does.  "greater love hath no man thatn this to give up his life for his friends"  which is exactly what he did for us. And yes that means you and me. Keep up your studying and you will read confirmation of him dying for the sins of all of us.|`|mWFlRQHRaa	"Jesus loves me,  this I know,  for the bible tells me so"    Don't you love brainwashing children with rhyming songs?|`|tx4bRDrXaa	Jesus came and died for our sins,and was resurrected to heaven.   John 5:28,29 Jesus speaks of a resurrection  Do not marvel at this because the hour is coming when all those in the memorial tombs will hear is voice and come out.  This tells us that individually Jesus will call out each of our names in the resurrection.Imagine the love that he has for us that he would know each person and their name individually.  He has been appointed the judge by his father,so he will know each person and their deeds.Matthew 7;22 Matthew 25;31    Jesus never wanted to be praised or bring attention to himself when on the earth he always attributed the Glory to his Father and that is what he taught us to do.    But he laid down his life willingly for us.  He said no one has love greater than this that someone should surrender his soul in behalf of his friends.John 15:13    Isaiah 53:7 He was brought like a lamb to a slaughter,he did not open his mouth.    Read the account at John 4:9  The Samaritan woman said to him:" How is it despite being a Jew ask me for a drink when   I am a Samaritan woman?  For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.  27 Now at this point his desciples arrived,and they began to wonder because he was speaking with a woman,of course no one said what are you looking for or why do you talk with her?    The point of all this is that in the days of Jesus the Jews were prejudice.They hated the Samaritans.And under the law a man was not to speak to a woman.So Jesus not only showed impartiality toward another race,but he also had great respect for women.  His desciples did not understand the point of his teaching at the time,but they were afraid to question it.    So yes Jesus does love us as individuals and he is not partial.Revelation 7:9,10 Exodus 6:3|`|g4AAZRuxaa	Yes He does.|`|GqNZInUbaa	Yes Lord, yes Lord, yes Lord . yes|`|SawySuLRaa	Jesus loves me,  this I know,  for the bible tells me so.|`|fb20242b0c0635b69a6d2c2fceab8b4eaa	Yes.

"Come now; let us leave.|`|vZqYUZk1aa	its a whole picture, not just pieces of the puzzle    As the father has loved me so do i love you.  I John    the prayer that connected me to Jesus love from the bible where he says speaking from heaven   "I love you, and ask you to repent from your sins quickly, Behold i stand at your heart's door and knock to come in, if you ask me in, I will be your friend to fellowship/sup with you and you with me."  Revelation 1:1 chapter 1 verse 1 and 3:19&20    please pray this prayer if you havent already   so i prayed too=   "Help me Jesus, thank you that you loved me enough to die for me, come into my heart and be my friend, amen."    AND TRUELY JESUS CAME INTO MY HEART then he says  "I will never leave you nor forsake you."  Hebrews 13:5    and you will truely know from your heart the love of Jesus, and if you have share it with others that have not come to know his love yet too.   it will help too ...Jesus said if you love me share the gospel/feed my sheep.      INTERESTING how those that reject Jesus come through and give mad grade to those that answer yes to this question, normally I dont grade, but it hurts to see others so intense against Jesus  what did he ever do against them?  Isaiah 53 predicts He will be rejected and lay down his life to make forgivenss for our sins.    daily i read the bible and pray rededicating my life to Jesus and asking for a fresh anointing/fresh help within from Jesus...    Love of Jesus is wonderful, and in love he corrects me, too to help me      Jesus is truely my best friend even when i do wrong to help me get right i pray  "Jesus forgive me for letting you down, help me do better and restore the joy of my salvation, amen  from Psalm 51 after David had committed adultry and murder.  and was forgiven by God, and given help to do better, yet he reaped what he sowed and his own children went against each other and David too.  So be careful what you do, but know this, he is your best friend no matter what.  yet the other side comes to condemn me "He is the accuser of the brethren"  remember when Jesus speaks to your heart, it will always be with love not condemnation.    the whole picture says totally I love you unconditionally to each and every person    on the cross Jesus didnt say i love you if....  He said even to his crucifiers, "Father forgive them for they know not what they do."    he got on the cross for each and every one of us totally    you appear to me to have a very sensitive heart, maybe not feeling worthy of his love....truth be told, you are, yet none of us ever did enough to be worthy of his love.....He loves us at our worst  just as much as at our best    someone asked Jesus how much do you love me, and he put out his arms and said this much...and was nailed to the cross.    the movie so powerful  ....The Passion of the Christ  seen on sight impared they put it into english and even explain things in the movie too shows his love litterally to die for our sins and rise to offer to come into our heart's and be our best friend,     David in Jesus care and prAYER FOR YOU and His amazing grace too.|`|qEIURrnJaa	Yes, He does.|`|IhNqlAQpaa	Completely from a Biblical perspective, yes Jesus loves each person individually and equally.    Romans 8:38,39 says "For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord."    and Romans 5:8 says "but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us."    Actually according the Bible Jesus is God, just limited into a human body.

J7KSKm54aa	Some idiot- like stealing is the equivalent of murder or rape.|`|atfKCzmPaa	SIN  Anything not in harmony with, hence contrary to, Gods personality, standards, ways, and will; anything marring ones relationship with God. It may be in word (Job 2:10; Ps 39:1), in deed (doing wrong acts [Le 20:20; 2Co 12:21] or failing to do what should be done [Nu 9:13; Jas 4:17]), or in mind or heart attitude (Pr 21:4; compare also Ro 3:9-18; 2Pe 2:12-15). Lack of faith in God is a major sin, showing, as it does, distrust of him or lack of confidence in his ability to perform. (Heb 3:12, 13, 18,?19) A consideration of the use of the original-language terms and examples associated with them illustrates this.  The common Hebrew term translated sin is chat?tath; in Greek the usual word is ha?mar?tia. In both languages the verb forms (Heb., cha?ta; Gr., ha?mar?tano) mean miss, in the sense of missing or not reaching a goal, way, mark, or right point. At Judges 20:16 cha?ta is used, with a negative, to describe the Benjamites who were slingers of stones to a hairbreadth and would not miss. Greek writers often used ha?mar?tano with regard to a spearman missing his target. Both of these words were used to mean missing or failing to reach not merely physical objects or goals (Job 5:24) but also moral or intellectual goals or marks. Proverbs 8:35,?36 says the one finding godly wisdom finds life, but the one missing [from Heb., cha?ta] wisdom is doing violence to his soul, leading to death. In the Scriptures both the Hebrew and Greek terms refer mainly to sinning on the part of Gods intelligent creatures, their missing the mark with regard to their Creator.  Comparative Gravity of Wrongdoing. Although sin is sin, and in any case could justly make the guilty one worthy of sins wages, death, the Scriptures show that God views mankinds wrongdoing as varying in degrees of gravity. Thus, the men of Sodom were gross sinners against Jehovah, and their sin was very heavy. (Ge 13:13; 18:20; compare 2Ti 3:6,?7.) The Israelites making a golden calf was also called a great sin (Ex 32:30,?31), and Jeroboams calf worship similarly caused those of the northern kingdom to sin with a great sin. (2Ki 17:16,?21) Judahs sin became like that of Sodom, making the kingdom of Judah abhorrent in Gods eyes. (Isa 1:4,?10; 3:9; La 1:8; 4:6) Such a course of disregard for Gods will can make even ones very prayer become a sin. (Ps 109:7, 8,?14) Since sin is an affront to Gods own person, he is not indifferent to it; as its gravity increases, his indignation and wrath are understandably increased. (Ro 1:18; De 29:22-28; Job 42:7; Ps 21:8,?9) His wrath, however, is not solely due to the involvement of his own person but is likewise stirred by the injury and injustice done to humans and particularly to his faithful servants.Isa 10:1-4; Mal 2:13-16; 2Th 1:6-10.|`|XHJlQcivaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WH5D8MOQ...    explained everything in there ^^|`|47f596346f675aa52012de1d79feedc9aa	That saying is based on a passage from the book of James that basically says that ALL sin is disobeying God, so all sin deserves death in Hell, regardless of how small that it may seem to us. Obviously different sins have different consequences, but it is not the specific action that makes God hate evil, rather it is the general idea of disobeying God, period, that makes sin so bad, no matter what form a particular sin might take (James 2:10-11).    ===edit===    For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it. For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.   ~James 2:10,11 (NIV)|`|akwVAZcEaa	Are you referring to James 2:10?   If so, James (likely Jesus' half-brother) was the writer.  Re the quote: "he who delivered Me over to you is guilty of the greater sin", it's in comparison to the evil of those who came, with clubs and ropes, to arrest Jesus against the evil done by Judas Iscariot in betraying Him.  Judas delivered Jesus to the Pharisees and the mob, therefore his sin was greater than theirs.|`|JKJqJWTRaa	Absurd|`|EAuMJrs4aa	All sin is equal before God's eyes. There are no little sins.

b660102b2fc9513dd1125d9410450d92aa	I am going to try to give some ideas in regards to the direction you may want to take this. So much can be learned from this book, <br>  <br>  Job was a blameless and righteous man in God's eyes as well as the people around him. He was a successful if not wealthy man. He was well respected in the community. When he lost everything, people assumed he was guilty of wrongdoing. They based this on their own success and feelings of righteousness because of their success. Morally is it correct to assume the quality of virtue and morals based on accumulation or forfeiture of material items? <br>   <br>  Job said he was innocent and didn't know why this was happening?  Without proof of wrong doing they shunned him, doubted him and blamed him for his own sufferings. Should suffering be allowed as evidence of wrongdoing?  This was done (Chapter 4: 7 Reflect now, What innocent person perishes? Since when are the upright destroyed?) Is it right to assume God is responsible directly for the suffering? God allowed it but did not inflict it. Was there own ignorance promoted by their own fears or lack of understanding God's will or was it for the loss of their own material things? (Chapter 6:21 It is thus that you have now become for me; you see a terrifying thing and are are afraid.) How moral is it to judge the soul of another based on poverty and disease? <br>  <br>  The people around Job used God to justify their own judgements of wrongdoing. They wronged an innocent man with the use of righteousness to commit an injustice. The Lord said unto Eliphaz the Temanite, "I am angry with you and with your two friends; for you have not spoken rightly concerning me, as has my servant Job". This involves Eliphaz and two other of Job's friends bearing false testimony against Job. Should untruths be justified to right a perceived wrong?  <br>  <br>  Well anyway I have gone on long enough.

They may speak some truth, or even a lot of truth, but if they cannot get the most basic question right (as to whether there is or is not a Supreme Being, a divine Creator) and profess that they "know" there is not a God, then their whole paradigm of understanding is based on a lie and they fulfill the description given in Romans Chapter 1, a portion of which states,  "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools,"    Does it embarrass you that your question was flawed in it's shallowness?|`|p1RdTbP2aa	No!

It appears to them that they would rather you worship their God then make the world God created a better place for more of Gods children.

If you're thinking about the "unforgivable sin" of blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, read it in context:  Jesus was addressing Pharisees who were essentially saying they didn't need the salvation Jesus was offering.    Remember that we all have free will.  Unless we freely ask for forgiveness of our sins, we don't get it.  God doesn't force it onto us.  That's why it's  unforgivable:  because you don't ask to be forgiven.    If you ask, then it isn't unforgivable anymore.

In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid.

If you practice this for about 5 minutes a day in a while you can really learn some things for life, not just memorize pronunciation. There are tons of courses you can choose from. really really check it out and sign up, i promise you have nothing to lose. Follow the link and click the "Lean with iKnow!" button (in the center left) and it will introduce you to a free demo. Also on the demo I would recommend doing the "romanji" mode because you wont have to deal with the writing part as much.    Also, a game for the Nintendo ds "my Japanese coach" talks a lot about pronunciation. You are actually able to compare the your voice with the native speakers voice so you can see how well your doing. But i have to warn you that this game starts at a low level (example: Koniciwa) so if your higher up then don't buy this, unless your just looking for review|`|AA10948829	No where.|`|B7C5PPgdaa	you can enrich your Japanese Vocabulary and Kanji at http://japaneseclass.jp/ its fun! just like playing game  and its free!

Germs as the source of disease is "just a theory".    Creationists have NO idea what the definition of the word "theory" is.  Theories do not graduate into "facts" or "laws".  Theories either get shot down, change, or get more confirmation.|`|5ExSaZ9Qaa	"Anyone who doesn't believe in the theory of gravity is invited to jump from a ten-storey window" - Richard Dawkins    I busted out laughing when I saw that quote.  Wasn't that said when he was speaking to Ted Haggard?    Oh, to answer your questions.  I don't think retards, oops, I mean religious followers believe in science.  They don't believe in gravity nor do they believe in plate tectonics.|`|AA11692259	oh sure.......oh sure....  funny how you will believe science when it suits you.. just like the rest of the religious...  as soon as it doesnt suit your needs you dismiss it    another reason why im an  atheist|`|P91FugsAaa	The real question is, if plate techtonics is false, then where do earthquakes come from... the wrath of god?  If true, then god deliberately created a unstable planet for us?
6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Um, now we're veering a bit off course.    Perhaps you should address the "Germ Theory of Disease" and ask them whether or not they reject it in favor of "Intelligent Infection".|`|	yes I believe in music, music is a concept of the brain.|`|	Music is theory?|`|	Would you go troll in traffic or something.|`|	i believe in creation but not music|`|	Music isn't a theory...I have some music on my ipod...|`|	lol, that's not really what the theory of music is, but i think you know that|`|	God is just a theory too, or not even a theory.|`|	can't say just a theory|`|	music is nice but MY BELIEF IS IN GOD.... BElief isnt used for every circumstance..|`|	The definitions of "music theory" and "scientific theory" are completely unrelated.    So stick to better comparisons like gravity.  Or atoms.  Or cells.  Or string theory.  You get the idea.|`|	i think you should just use all your points up asking this questions in different forms|`|	did you mean, that they do NOT belive in music, perhaps?|`|	How is music a theory?|`|	bridge is that way, troll.|`|	This is an egregious logic error.  A thing like in one way is not necessarily alike in another way. You also commit the fault of equivocation, using the same word in two different senses.  One doesn't 'believe' in Music like in a theory, at least not on planet Earth :)|`|	They don't understand what a scientific theory is. They treat theory's like hypothesis's.|`|	LOL Music theory is an entirely different thing than the evolutionary theory. Look it up on wikipedia or something to get a better idea.   BTW, many Christians accept the theory of evolution to an extent. Do I believe we evolved from monkeys? No. I believe in intelligent design. I also, however, believe that different creatures can evolve from their original form. There is a forum on that somewhere, but I can't remember the address.|`|	Music Theory is only a theory, not a fact.  Thanks.  Not everyone got it though.|`|	If I had a dollar for every mocking, sneering STUPID question then I would be very rich!  As another answer indicated ... your premise is ridiculous because music THEORY exists outside of musical practice and any "believe" that one may have in music is not in its theory, per se, but in its practice.    So, I ask you simply this.  Where is the evidence for the PRACTICE of spontaneous formation of life born only of the existence of all the necessary sustaining factors; e.g., air, water, temperature, etc.?  Where is the evidence of the PRACTICE of life forms leaping from one species to form new species?      As I say, your premise is ludicrous.  But you knew that, didn't you?|`|	Consider this  Mysteries In Science  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zTXxpXOo...    The Young Age of the Earth  http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...

c56e8a27e1fe5b4843f30c8834cc5d35aa	Don't give up hope.  We're out here.  When in the company of women, don't be shy about noticing and complimenting their clothes and appearance.  Ms. Right will catch on that you know more about fashion and style than most guys, and her curiosity will bring you together. You could also get dressed up and go to CD 'friendly' clubs. If you don't get out and about, how will you meet the person you seek?|`|CADaAIHIaa	Yes, they're out there, but I fear they're few and far between.     You don't say how old you are, and this could have a great impact on things. For instance, if you're younger I think you'll have a harder time because you're encroaching upon her territory. Women like to be the woman in the relationship. She wants to be the one that's pretty, feminine and wears the dresses. How could you blame her for that? Plus a heterosexual girl wants a boyfriend, not a girlfriend.    And if you're older, how could you ask her to invest herself in a relationship in which the outcome could be so obviously questionable? How could she trust that you wouldn't some day decide you're a transsexual and walk out on her. Not to mention that heterosexual women want boyfriends or husbands, not girlfriends or wives.     Either situation could have a girl questioning her own sexuality and creating confusion for her - depending on the extent of your cross dressing and particularly if you like to cross dress during intimate moments. Let's not even get into "what would the neighbours say".    I'm not saying this to be be funny or insulting. Seriously, it's a lot to ask of a girl, don't you think?     If you're able to keep her isolated from your cross dressing, then I think chances are you'll probably fare much better. Just tell her this is a part of what makes you you, but don't insist she take part in it. Keep it separate from her, and reassure her that no matter what you do, she is always *the* woman in the relationship.    Once she begins to be able to trust and feel more secure, who knows.     Overall, I'd say honesty is key. Hide nothing, feel no shame, but accept that many women may find it just too hard to adjust to. Besides, it's the one that can adjust over time that you're really interested in, right?    And then again, the next woman you meet just might be right into it.     I wish you luck.|`|qiQPiMJMaa	I'll accept u hun, its not a thing to be ashamed of at all xx|`|jXvHYVq4aa	Yes, they're out there, but I fear they're few and far between.

I kind of wrote about it in this blog:    http://pop-shot.blogspot.com/2008/04/des...|`|CfZn9kK5aa	There are women out there like that! Don't lose hope! I, for instance, like cross dressers.

Like i said if your scared shes gonna break off the friendship.  Then just dont tell her.Or just wait alittle longer too tell her.|`|0f6he9HDaa	I think you're better off just leaving it alone for a while.

AA11440601	John 21:15-17 states:     When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."     He then said to him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."     He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was distressed that he had said to him a third time, "Do you love me?" and he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." (Jesus) said to him, "Feed my sheep.     Matthew 16:17-19 states:    Jesus said to him in reply, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah. For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my heavenly Father. And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven."     The Catholic Church believes the Lord made Simon alone, whom he named Peter, the "rock" of his Church. He gave him the keys of his Church and instituted him shepherd of the whole flock.    The Pope is the senior pastor of 1.1 billion Catholic Christians, the direct successor of Simon Peter.    The Popes main roles include teaching, sanctifying, and governing.    For more information, see the Catechism of the Catholic Church, section 880-882: http://www.usccb.org/catechism/text/pt1s...    With love in Christ.|`|E71jweytaa	you are my rock, and on this rock I shall build my church    and to who were the keys of heaven given?|`|2d2ZuimCaa	No he wasn't. Peter 2:4 " To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious,  5  Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.  6  Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded.  7  Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed, the same is made the head of the corner,  8  And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also they were appointed. Ephesians 2:20 " And are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone;"Corinthians 10:4  "And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ."

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!|`|mfSp38yzaa	Look it up in Matthew 16:13-20    Doesn't use the word "pope," but Jesus makes Peter head of the Church|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	That is not Biblical.

The term "Pope" wasn't used until a few hundred years later.    Here's the oath of office, straight from the Bible:    Joh 21:14  This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to his disciples, after he was risen from the dead.   Joh 21:15  When therefore they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.   Joh 21:16  He saith to him again: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: yea, Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: Feed my lambs.   Joh 21:17  He said to him the third time: Simon, son of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he had said to him the third time: Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: Feed my sheep.     Protestants please take note.    http://www.saintpetersbasilica.org/Necro...

10c1407ad3b148843d1e616e9a4c6215aa	Oh, dear! There always are some bright sparks who get the wrong end of the stick, and others who think they are  absolutely "right" even if they are mistaken about some aspects of a question.  I was "Une adolescente qui allait au collge en mobylette".    "Un collge" is a secondary school  up to the age of 15, but the  term can also describe a school that deals with more technical, specialised, or practical subjects at an age higher than that. It also describes what is called a tertiary college in the UK.  http://www.wordreference.com/fren/coll%C...    The fact that "adolescentes" is spelt with an  "e" at the end means that the word describes teenage GIRLS, and NOT adolescents in general or boys.    "Une mobylette" is a moped, namely a bicycle propelled by a  very small two stroke engine. It is not a Vespa  or a Scooter (which go at greater speed and have a bigger engine).  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobylette  These were very popular in France amongst teenagers as  you could drive them from the age of 14 onwards and you did not need a licence to do so, but since January 2004,  a test and a permit are compulsory.  The "adolescentes" mentioned above would therefore have been older than 14 if they were riding mobylettes, and not "borderline" pre-teenage girls in middle school.|`|Xverqpu4aa	School/ College, adolescents/ teenagers, moped.    Surely you must be joking?|`|Qqg5ALE2aa	Plonkeur............|`|swO14r70aa	Well college translates to school but if your are writing it there needs to be an acent on the first e.|`|utMcsTlUaa	FOR THE RECORD!  The French word "collge" does NOT mean just school or college. It is an easy mistake, however this is a false cognate, or faux-ami. Collge refers to the English equivalent of middle school or junior high school, serving ages 11-15. School in general is "cole." Higher education which we call college in English is "universit." For more information of the French educational system, look at the first source below.    Adolescentes means quite basically adolescents, however it tends to mean older children in France. "Enfant" means child, and is used more for ages 1-11. 12 and up, adolescent is used more, meaning something similar to teenager. The preteen range, however, is fuzzy, and you can use either one.    As mentioned before, a mobylette (it would be mobilette in English) is a commonly used word for mopeds, or Vespas, which are commonly used for transportation around urban communities in Europe. For more information on mopeds, check out the second source below.
9Q6CkSMzaa	Social Revolution?    Depends on what you're protesting. Social equality? Women's rights? To abolish slavery?    Let me give you some examples in history.   In the southern part of Africa, when the Africans wanted equality to Caucasians (Hispanics and Asians also were discriminated against, but being Africa and all, the majority was Africans), some guy came up and was the leader of the revolution. They made passive protests, coming together in masses, and protesting laws that restricted them, such as their poor educational opportuinites, not being able to vote, and whatnot.    Then things got more violent, and the rest of the world suspended trade with that area of Africa, because they treated the natives that way. They eventually gained freedoms and rights.    So, just start protesting. That's the best way to start a social revolution. Get a group of followers together, and start protesting.

Parents are opting to take their children to group parties or church activities instead.|`|FHi0v36eaa	I agree, I haven't noticed as many trick or treaters in the past few years. It kind of sucks cuz I love seeing what kinds of costumes kids think up, some can get pretty creative. But I guess it also depends on the area you live. Where I live there weren't many kids that were living there so we didn't get many people, but this year a lot have moved in so now there are tonnes. <br>  <br>  Plus I think there is a movement towards Halloween parties rather than trick or treating, which is a shame. I loved going out as a kid and I hate to see the kids not being able to enjoy it. |`|bab6b6b78742630cc91ef8daa2173147aa	I've noticed that, too. I don't think it was even 10 years ago, really, I noticed the drop in trick-or-treaters right after 9/11, when I was still in high school. Supposedly there was a rumor going around that Halloween would be the date of the "next terrorist attack," and the target would be the little kids out trick-or-treating... It was nonsense, of course, but parents got spooked and kept their kids in. Soon after I noticed a lot of church and school-based Halloween parties and such. <br>  <br>  While I missed the kids coming through, I think it's probably a good thing that there are more community activities now. Strangers used to bring their kids into my neighborhood by the carload for Halloween, and while I didn't have a problem with that, I do think it's good that parents are being more cautious about strange neighborhoods and houses. At this point, you just never know.<br>  <br>  However, in the past couple of years, I've noticed that the numbers of trick-or-treaters around here has increased quite a bit. Last year I actually ran out of candy - and I had one of those big plastic cauldrons full!  I guess the "threat" is over...|`|itAmR5Htaa	just to add a little extra to what the others were saying, you will find also that these days the children are just too lazy to bother........they would much rather be indoors playing on their Xboxes and Playstations.....it wasn't so long ago that when it snowed there would be tonnes of children playing in it and sliding down hillsides, these days you are lucky to see two.....its a shame, but children seem to just want to stay in and shoot aliens or watch tv.|`|IAT5EOoeaa	People are afraid that their children will be abducted, so they can't send the kids out alone, and many parents are too lazy to bring their kids out, so the kids end up going to lame Halloween parties.

AA11918110	Nobody ever said that they predicted this date of 12/21/2012 to be the end of the world, but rather this is what people are speculating the meaning to be. The Mayan calandar, for whatever reason stopped on this exact date. Maybe it means the end of the world, maybe it means they just got tired of keeping track, maybe their society started to collapse and the person or persons in charge of the calendar gave up on this or were killed. We'll never really know, but I'm going to make sure to have my son with me on that date and try to do as many fun events with him as possible in the days prior (just in case). If it does not happen, then life goes on and we continue to evolve or go extinct. Either way, nothing is guaranteed in this life and eventually our world will come to an ultimate end when our Sun starts to burn out. Just thank your lucky stars that you won't be alive when this happens..............|`|62448526b9217dfdf52b5f199ef340a9aa	. The Maya's had an extremely complicated method of keeping track of time, based on three separate calendars. The most important, most encompassing of these calendars holds the `Long Count': the period from the beginning until the end of time. And on December 21st 2012, the Long Count expires. It will be point zero. Time will be up for the Universe. It will be, literally, the end of days.<br>  <br>  , There's a couple of very interesting (and disturbing) facts about the Maya calendar's end. Most intriguing, 21-12-2012 is not a day like any other. Up in the sky, an extraordinary and incredibly rare event will take place. The Sun will move to a unique spot in the sky -- and hold still for a while, since it is solstice day. The Sun will sit precisely on the heavenly crossroads between the Milky Way and the galactic equinox, forming a perfect alignment with the center of the galaxy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   The night time sky is crossed by several mathematical lines. One is the axis of the Milky Way -- the Milky Way, as you may know, being that bright band of stars you can see running across the heavens on a clear night. Another important line is the cosmological ecliptic: the axis along which the constellations travel, the line that defines coordinates in space.<br>  <br>  You can say a lot about the Maya, but you've got to hand it to them: they knew a hell of a lot about stars. For instance, they calculated the exact duration of a year to a thousandth of a decimal point, much more precise than any Greek or enlightened philosopher ever did. Also, they were able to predict every solar and lunar eclipse until this day. And obviously, they knew where the galactic equinox and the exact middle of the Milky Way lay: they called this crossing `the Sacred Tree'.<br>  |`|N9skHYHcaa	They havent.  Its just another y2k scare type thing.  THese doomsday prophecies appear every 10-15 years... and yet the world is still turning.  And even if they did predict something, then there has been hundreds of years for that something to come true.  So, that prediction probably has more chance of coinciding with an event.   <br>  <br>  Edit:  For example, i can predict we will have flying cars in the future.  And over hundreds and hundreds of years, that will eventually come true.  That doesnt mean i can tell the future.|`|gTSzn3DHaa	they phucked with our minds so we would do stupid things|`|UNBzZ3x3aa	Not sure, but kind of funny, I was in "Borders" books yesterday and there was a paperback in the sci-fi section titled "2012--the mayan calendar ends" (by Strieber)...just reminded me of all the 2012 questions here....|`|YUugeUHxaa	The Mayans predicted Nostradamus...<br>  <br>  and Hitler...<br>  and Mussolini...<br>  and gasoline-powered automobiles...<br>  and airplanes...<br>  and antibiotics...<br>  and eye glasses...<br>  and fire trucks...<br>  and elevators...<br>  and open heart surgery...

I also thinks it promotes selfishness.  If you are all this and that and believe so and so you will go to heaven.  Not for being good just because you are by nature. ..

I consider myself an agnostic atheist in the same way that I am agnostic about the existence of things like leprechauns, aliens who visit earth, or the possible existence of a race of cats with human like intelligence on another planet. I can't prove any of these things are not real definitively but I have no positive evidence that would lead me to conclude that they were. This is why I am not a believer. I have never encountered any evidence that for me was credible for the existence of such a super being. I think some god concepts are more plausible then others, pantheistic, Taoist, or Spinozian god concepts for example seem more plausible but still lack evidence. I think the god depicted in the big three monotheistic religions seems highly unlikely and there are good arguments against the existence but whether these prove its nonexistence depends on the person. People believe on faith because they were raised to, want to, or need to. The burden of proof falls on the person making the claim. If you say I know that god doesn't exist then you may have the burden to prove your assertion. If you say god exists then the burden is on you to prove it.|`|QDFj9JPfaa	..."religion(s)" are mankind's foolish attempts to reach God.

We all have the ability to choose..."A"theists make their choice and "believers" in God (YHWH) make theirs... but be careful about just calling yourself a believer...

4b21006f14999f52b2e85e092542486baa	Halloween means All Saints Eve, the evening before the feast of All Saints Day (November 1st).  The word comes from All Hallows Evening, Hallow is old English or Scots for Holy or Saint, E'en is short for Evening.<br>  <br>  All Saints Day is an ancient Christian festival started in about 735 AD by a Pope in Rome. There is no evidence that this was anything at all to do with anything pagan, it remained a local Roman celebration for the first 50 - 100 years before a later Pope made it Europe-wide.<br>  <br>  The business about paganism comes from puritans who didn't like anything to do with the Pope or Saints or Catholic feasts. They accused it of being unbiblical, evil, pagan, which is why some people think it is really pagan. It's not, it's originally Catholic.|`|tFpcghhvaa	Read this - it has everything you want to know...<br>  <br>  History of name<br>  The term Halloween is shortened from All Hallows' Even (both "even" and "eve" are abbreviations of "evening", but "Halloween" gets its "n" from "even") as it is the eve of "All Hallows' Day",[6] which is now also known as All Saints' Day. It was a day of religious festivities in various northern European Pagan traditions,[3] until Popes Gregory III and Gregory IV moved the old Christian feast of All Saints' Day from May 13 (which had itself been the date of a pagan holiday, the Feast of the Lemures) to November 1. In the ninth century, the Church measured the day as starting at sunset, in accordance with the Florentine calendar. Although All Saints' Day is now considered to occur one day after Halloween, the two holidays were, at that time, celebrated on the same day. Liturgically, the Church traditionally celebrated that day as the Vigil of All Saints, and, until 1970, a day of fasting as well. Like other vigils, it was celebrated on the previous day if it fell on a Sunday, although secular celebrations of the holiday remained on the 31st. The Vigil was suppressed in 1955, but was later restored in the post-Vatican II calendar.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween</a>|`|xiA5Iu5Saa	All Hallows Eve

I wouldn't push the issue as long as he is still affectionate in private.|`|jCmCpMdaaa	Sounds like he's letting other guys know that you are "his" - claiming his territory, so to speak.

And he kisses you in front of other guys to mark his territory, be glad he doesn't pee on you like a dog does!! |`|ewVZniY5aa	not that he hates to, it's just new to him.  your obviously his first real woman, so he finds it uncomfortable for people to see him with someone that he's serious about.  don't take it personal.  just not as touchy and feel as some of us are.  as far as in front of other guys, with the kissing, it's a man thing.  as if to say...this is mine...don't think about it!  lol  sounds stupid, cause it is.  we can be total jerks when we're not trying to be.  he'll come around.|`|DALf1hxLaa	Thier could be multiple reasons why.<br>  But in my opinoin, he dosnt like couples who holds hands because its too cliche.<br>  <br>  Or maybe hes just not used to that sorta of thing, maybe he was broguht up differently, have u known him since he was a kid or no?|`|174ccc71e04a275856234261592c2843aa	Because in front of other guys,he'd have to assert himself to show that you're his, and only his.

91acf4dec3b907fa1dddca164a816d32aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Scientific researchers specializing in human sexuality have shown that homosexuality is genetic.<br>  <br>  Scientific research publications from October 2004 and June 2008 stated that scientists have found that women tend to have more children when they inherit the same genetic factors linked to homosexuality in men. This fertility boost more than compensates for the lack of offspring fathered by gay men, and keeps the “gay” genetic factors in circulation. A lead researcher said "You have all this antagonism against homosexuality because they say it's against nature because it doesn't lead to reproduction. We found out this is not true because homosexuality is just one of the consequences of strategies for making females more fecund" and that their findings offered "a solution to the Darwinian paradox and an explanation of why natural selection does not progressively eliminate homosexuals."<br>  <br>  A 2005 study reported genetic scans showing a clustering of the same genetic pattern among gay men on three chromosomes - chromosomes 7, 8, and 10. The regions on chromosome 7 and 8 were associated with male sexual orientation regardless of whether the man got them from his mother or father. The regions on chromosome 10 were only associated with male sexual orientation if they were inherited from the mother.<br>  <br>  A study from 2006 said that researchers have known for years that a man's likelihood of being gay rises with the number of older biological brothers, but the new study found that the so-called "fraternal birth order effect" persists even if gay men were raised away from their biological families. Anthony F. Bogaert, Ph.D., professor at Brock University, said "The research suggests that the development of sexual orientation is influenced before birth." The older-brother effect was constant regardless of whether the men were raised with natural, adopted or stepbrothers. It also didn't matter if they weren't raised with their biological mothers. If gay younger brothers and older brothers don't have the same home environments, what do they have in common? "They shared the same uterus, the same womb, the same mother," Bogaert said.|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It does seem to be a combination of genetic and hormonal events that take place within the womb.  It is not just genes, nor just hormones, but a joining of those two forces.<br>  <br>  This is why Swedish scientists have recently found that the brains of gay males and straight women -- and the brians of lesbian woman and straight men -- are very much like each other in certain areas having to do with sexual attraction and desire.<br>  <br>  Like being left-handed, same-sex attraction does seem to be with us from birth.|`|AA11980483	Yes. <br>  Sexual orientation is for the most part formed as a fetus.|`|Q79XFah1aa	Almost everything about us has to do with our genes.<br>  <br>  Haven't you ever read those studies about twins separated at birth who drive the same car and have the same breed of dog and marry women with the same names?

a2460985a804cf1e397e701de5b6b1a5aa	If you are referring to Enlightenment as a movement that emerged in Europe... in the present day discourses... postmodernism seems to be up in arms against the notion of this universal Euro-centric 'enlightenment'.  The present day social theorists see Enlightenment as part of the European colonizing mission where a certain kind of rationality with European experience as a role model was imposed on the rest of the world which in turn had nothing to offer but only to catch up with the West and modernize.    Personally, i am weary of going overboard with this present day trend, which is letting all kinds of weird irrational locally dominating ideas to assert themselves against modernity.  Various fundamentalist religious movements are questioning the regime of reason by suggesting that one truth is equal to the other so we will follow ours whatever the consequences!  Evolution and creationism are projected as equal.  The boundary between myth and science is being collapsed.  There is a great danger in this tendency, however exciting it may appear, for the end of reason means proliferation of multitudes of lunacy and parochialisms which are hard to manage...

As said these are human constructs and work within the world of dualism.  To an enlightened being nothing is good nor evil.    To us from our position, is enlightenment good?  Well actually for most people, probably not, because it dissolves the concept of self to the point where 'you' no longer exist.  Life is no longer about your happiness or your emotions, in fact you do not even consider things alive or not.      Enlightenment is a strange concept.

That is because the basic premise of these two beliefs are mutually exclusive.    Islam claims that Jesus is not the son of God; that Allah neither begat nor is begotten.  Christianity states that Jesus is the only begotten son of God.      Islam claims that Jesus did not die on the cross.  Islam does not point to Jesus Christ as the only way to the Father.  Christianity teaches that Jesus died on the cross to pay for our sins, and that the only way to the Father is by the son.

AA11892957	*Liam is part of a religious hate group! probley an ex CAN member*    Scientology IS a religion, recognized finally in the US in the early ninety's and here in Australia in the late eighty's. Basically some of Liam's information is right...but we are not a Cult in the negative sense of the word. Our religion is merely paying the price for having a different beliefs and principles than other religions, especially our beliefs in regard to the pseudo science of psychiatry! Basically Scientology could be best described as an applied philosophy - meaning it gives you tech that can be used in your day-to-day life to help improve communicative skills etc.    If you want to learn more please visit one of our Org's and see for yourself what Scientology can do for you.    By the way Liam...it is noted in Australia that the judge who finally lifted the ban on scientology here said in court 'This is one of the most embarassing things to happen in the history of the country" refering to the original banning of Scientology....It is now welcomed by the government here.|`|AA10190510	Yes you are correct. It is a real cult with religious practices. Most religions only give partial truth. This religion does this also.|`|AA10885175	Hi ya,     Scientology is a cult that was created by L Ron Hubbard who lied about his life and his research in order to gain adherents.  It started with a book he wrote called Dianetics in 1950, and shortly after he created scientology.  It is said he did it on a bet, that he, a science fiction writer to cause a true cult following.    Since then a dangerous vicious organisation called the Church of Scientology has emerged, trapping individuals into the cult, causing them to part with their money and their individuality to mesh into the cult.  I will start with the beliefs, and the follow on to resources on the net critical of scientology which has evidence of which I speak.    Scientologys Beliefs in short:    We are a thetan (soul), that is reincarnated  We collect engrams when unconscious   Engrams plague our reactive mind causing all sorts of personality problems &/or physical ailments.  Auditing (hypotic trance-like questioning while hooked up to a crude lie detector) gets rid of them.  They believe this takes them to new heights of awareness and ability - this has never been demonstrated.  Hubbard discovered and mapped out the only way to Total Freedom.    You then learn that you are also infected with ancient aliens that were dropped here to solve an over-population problem - this is the story of Xenu.  So more auditing is required to audit all the little Body Thetans you have stuck to you, as well as removing all  the various Implants that Hubbard 'discovered' you had.  You audit these beings out yourself paying for the privilage. To go right to the top will cost around $380,000, maybe more...    Or go to wikipedia and read what they think:    "Some central beliefs of Scientology:        * A person is an immortal spiritual being (termed a thetan) who possesses a mind and a body.      * Through the Scientology process of "auditing", one can free oneself of "engrams" and "implants" to reach the state of "Clear", and after that, the state of "Operating Thetan". Each state is said to represent recovering the native spiritual abilities of the individual, and to confer dramatic mental and physical benefits.      * The thetan has lived through many past lives and will continue to live beyond the death of the body.      * A person is basically good, but becomes "aberrated" by moments of pain and unconsciousness in his or her life.      * What is true for you is what you have observed yourself. No beliefs should be forced as "true" on anyone. Thus, the tenets of Scientology are expected to be tested and seen to either be true or not by Scientology practitioners.      * Psychiatry and psychology are evil and abusive. [20]      * Humans retain many emotional problems caused by early stages of evolution"  http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientolog...  http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/xenu    See here for the main critical site of scientology, there is a wealth of information on this site:  http://www.clambake.org    This is one critics view (the owner of the site):    "In a Nutshell        The Church of Scientology is a vicious and dangerous cult that masquerades as a religion. Its purpose is to make money. It practices a variety of mind-control techniques on people lured into its midst to gain control over their money and their lives. Its aim is to take from them every penny that they have and can ever borrow and to also enslave them to further its wicked ends.        It was started in the 1950s by a science fiction writer named L. Ron Hubbard in fulfilment to his declared aim to start a religion to make money. It is an offshoot to a method of psychotherapy he concocted from various sources which he named "Dianetics". Dianetics is a form of regression therapy. It was then further expanded to appear more like a religion in order to enjoy tax benefits. He called it "Scientology".        Scientology is a confused concoction of crackpot, dangerously applied psychotherapy, oversimplified, idiotic and inapplicable rules and ideas and science-fiction drivel that is presented to its members (at the "advanced" levels) as profound spiritual truth. "  http://www.clambake.org/roland-intro.htm...      Justice Latey, ruling in the High Court of London:        "Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious...It is corrupt sinister and dangerous. It is corrupt because it is based on lies and deceit and has its real objective money and power for Mr. Hubbard... It is sinister because it indulges in infamous practices both to its adherents who do not toe the line unquestionably and to those who criticize it or oppose it. It is dangerous because it is out to capture people and to indoctrinate and brainwash them so they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from ordinary thought, living, and relationships with others."   http://www.clambake.org/archive/judge_qu...

People belong to different groups for quite a few different reasons.  One big factor is the culture we are raised in.  Different cultures do see the world differently, and as you say, not any single religion can possibly have all the answers.  But each one has some of the answers.  The benefits of different kinds of religions are the unique viewpoints they offer.     Another factor is the faith one is raised in.  Sometimes this is a comfortable fit and the person remains in that religion for a lifetime.    Other times it's not a good fit and people have to examine beliefs to find a place where they feel that their needs are getting met--whether that need is a particular doctrine, a style of worship, a particular mix of age and backgrounds and personalities of the congregation, and so on.    Some people identity with or want to be a part of a certain form of outreach or mission a church has.    Some have  a strong need to name themselves as atheistic-- in a way this too is an expression of belief.  Others are quite happy to remain somewhere in between --they feel no need to identify as atheist nor do they identify with any particular religion.    I suppose it is human to feel we are right, but when people are pushy about their beliefs, I always wonder whether they truly feel as sure as they do, or do they need to convince me so that their own belief becomes stronger?    The approach I find more convincing is the one in which people preach their beliefs not with words but with actions of kindness, goodness and ethical behavior.    As you say there are many good people and we can learn from them, especially if they are living in ways that are sincere and respectful.|`|AA11284733	bc the poeple hwo are not cristin are influensed by satan and they will go to hell|`|AA11317725	John 14:6 has your answer.  1 John 2:22|`|19c6d4f7d3d681f39f9bcd2984ab7345aa	Well there is free will first of all leaving you free to choose any religion out there or no religion at all.  Then there are SO many choices to pick from!  It's really all personal study and choice - I don't think there is a pat answer for this question since we're not programmed a certain way.  Even people raised in religious homes might turn away from their faiths and people raised in atheistic homes might embrace a religious faith one day.  It's all about free-will and personal choice - hopefully with a lot of studying of the scriptures so you can choose the best faith out there.  And yes, I think there is one true church or God wouldn't have left us an instruction book (the Bible) to find it and to figure out how to live moral, good lives.
AA12135182	When Christians use the expression the Son of God, Moslems vehemently protest, God has no son. They quote the Koran, which says, at Suras 4:169; 6:101; 19:36: God is only one God! Far be it from His glory that He should have a son! How, when He hath no consort, should He have a son? It beseemeth not God to beget a son.    Of course, it would be foolish for anyone to limit the power of God by saying, God CANNOT have a son. Truthfully, the Koran proclaims, Verily, God is Almighty. (2:19) He is the Creator of the universe, of heaven and earth and of the creatures in them. As God said to Abraham, that man of faith recognized by both Christians and Moslems, Is anything too extraordinary for Jehovah? A person who really is in submission to the Omnipotent God must agree with the prophet who said, With God all things are possible.Gen. 18:14; Matt. 19:26.    Long before the creation of his human son Adam, God already had countless spirit sons, angels, all of whom got their life from the Father without sexual reproduction and birth. (Job 38:1-7)  the Bible says Jehovah God has many sons, both angelic and human. (Gen. 6:4; Job 1:6; Luke 3:38)  But  there is an outstanding one we might properly call THE Son of God.    The PREEMINENT Son is the one of whom the Koran says God decreed His name shall be, Messiah Jesus the son of Mary, illustrious in this world, and in the next. (3:40) Yes, as a human he was the son of Mary, but who was the father responsible for Marys pregnancy, so that the child would be his son? Some stumble here by taking a carnal viewpoint. They imagine there was only one way for Mary to conceive and that was by having sexual relations, and God is not a man to have sexual relations with a woman. But even the Koran teaches that Jesus was conceived by an act of the divine will.    Whose act resulted in the life of Adam, the son of God? Gods. Hence Sura 3:52 says: Verily, Jesus is as Adam in the sight of God. Neither of them had a human father. So, inasmuch as Adam was a son of God, so is Jesus.  But Jesus did not first become a son of God when he was born of the chaste virgin Mary. He was foremost among the spirit sons of God who shouted for joy at the creation of the earth, as we read at Proverbs 8:22-31. (John 1:2, 3)|`|7f074de1ea6d83aab446b98c18e3d730aa	A 'literal' Child of God|`|AA12343985	I believe that we are each a part of God, a perfect individuation of the whole being, made of the same matter.

Do you believe the bible, if you you should really read it for yourself so you can find these answer yourself. It's alot better than just people telling you things that you don't understand. Well first of all in in Colossians 1:15 it says that he was the first born(or the first thing that god made) How is he god if god had to make him? Second of all in John 7:16 it Jesus says that What I teach is not mine but its his word the one that sent me. (Why if he's god tell you about some one else's word and not his? Why would some one have to send him if he is god?) And last but not least in John 14:28 Jesus say He who my father is greater than me. Why would he say that if he is god too? Just look in the back of your bible anytime you want a question answered.  Not only does it have a word indexed but if you go past that it also has bible topics for discussion. You should really read it yourself. Maybe this is gods way of drawing close to you.|`|221b768ed911e97187fac2838a8ca5a5aa	Because not all religious groups believe the same interpretation of the Bible. Personally, I dont believe in the Trinity because it says in the Bible God had NO BEGINNING, whilst Jesus was created by God. There are SO many proofs that they are seperate spirits.. but I wont bore you with that if you dont want to hear it. Basically, Christianity is seperated into more religions that believe in opposing ideas; your question is somewhat relevant to asking a muslim and a buddhist how the earth was created.

It kind of means like "a going away," "a moving on," "an annihilation," or "a departure."  You can say it's almost like death, but the soul is still there in a sense.  Have you seen the movie Fanaa?  It's really good with Aamir Khan and Kajol.
AA10932152	Well reading the bible tells me that he loves man and hates sin (evil)|`|AA11551690	God dislikes evil, not the evil-doer!  God loves all people.  He tells us to hate the evil, not the person doing the evil.  It is Satan that causes a person to commit an evil act.  This does not mean that people are not responsible for their evil actions, they are, but they are not to be hated.  The best way to overcome evil is to kill it with kindness.|`|09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	There's a view besides this dualistic view of good and evil; it was proposed by St. Augustine.  He says that all that God created is good.  According to theism, everything that exists is therefore good.  Good is something.  Evil, on the other hand, is simply a corruption of good.  It is nothing; it's not tangible, and you can't touch it.  You can't call something evil.  You can't hate evil in this sense, because in order to hate something, that something must actually exist as an actual object/idea/etc.  Evil, according to this view, does not exist however.  We see, however, that some people are more corrupted than others by this evil; yet, we must remember that everyone that exists still has good in him/her.  Just look at the example of Darth Vader, who turned from the bad side to the good side and maximized his goodness.  Therefore, neither God nor we can actively hate evil.  We can try to prevent the corruption of our good though.  Indeed, God loves all that EXISTS (thus not evil, which, again, does not exist).|`|7dec6d7ab8f24bbe3a32b290b52717a4aa	God loves the sinner, but he hates the sin.|`|4dafae58ed0451f8621c2eaddb377788aa	John 3:16 says that God so loved the world that He sent His ONLY Begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him(Christ) shall be saved.     Christ taught that God will not and cannot be apart of anything that is sin. He taught that it is our nature to be sinful, and that all sin, whether being greedy, or wanting what others have, or murder or sexual impurity, is the same to God.   However, because Christ was tempted to sin, but remained SINLESS, he became our substitute, through His selfless act of dying on a cross as payment for ALL sin (if you choose to believe in HIM, and ask HIS Forgiveness) "But the Wages of Sin are death, but the GIFT of God is ETERNAL life THROUGH Jesus Christ his Son".    Believing and acknowledging that you believe and a simple prayer to ask for Jesus to be your saviour is all it takes. The rest is a promise from God.   The Bible says that those who believe in HIM will not ever be without Him, and that after this earthly life is over, (yes, we all will die a physical death) that we will have a place with HIM Forever in Heaven.     go to the Website: www.lifegivingwords.com  select the audio tab and then select the book "This Was Your Life" by Rick Howard.

As he walks up to the pearly gates he notices another guy standing there. He thinks he's famous maybe a rock star. Before he has time to find out who the guy is out pops St. Peter and escorts the two gentlemen in telling them that he's taking them to where they will spent the rest of eternity.    The first place they come to is an old thatched roofed hut next to a stream with a few fruit trees in the back. It's nice enough, but the Pope thinks to himself "this can't be for me after all I'm the Pope". But sure enough St. Peter turns to him and says "Here you go Pope. If you need anything don't hesitate to ask".     The Pope thinks "Well this isn't too bad". Before he can walk through the door he turns to see a choir of angels descend down and scoop up the Rock Star and carry him up to a mansion in the cloud with gold columns, a swimming pool, even dancing lady angels.    A little pissed off the Pope turns to St. Peter and says "No offense, but what gives, after all I'm the Pope". St. Peter turns back and tells him "Yeah, you're the Pope. We got plenty of Popes. How many Rock Stars do you think we have?"

	Two possibilities:      1 John 2:19 says that such a person was never a believer.      There's also the possiblity that they did truly believed but wandered, and Jesus will bring them back.    If a person believes in faith alone in Jesus without adding any of their own works, then that person is saved and going to heaven, no matter what.      If a person departs, almost always it was a person that didn't believe in faith alone in Jesus without works, but instead added works, meaning they were never saved in the first place because they didn't believe the true Gospel.  They can be saved at any moment by believing in Jesus in faith alone without adding any of their own works.

And if there is a God, then we all still chose our own path but Christians will go to heaven and Non-Christians will go to hell.  It comes down  to choice.

In short, they would honor and observe the Torah, as He did.

JCnSm91uaa	They want to regain the respectability and supremacy they always held over scientific knowledge!    When the Bible was written and up to about 500 years ago this microscopic speck of dust that we call Earth located at the edge of the Milky Way was thought to be the center of this humongous universe. The Bible writers got their science from the Babylonians who also believed that the stars were hanging from a firmament as they revolve around the Earth, the rain water was coming down from above the firmament, the Sun was not a star, and so on.  When the Christians ruled most of the Western world anybody disagreeing with the Church dogmas on science in the Bible was severely punished. Galileo was one of the most famous victims of Church cruelty. Throughout history the Christians struggled to stop any scientific and social advancement to benefit mankind outside of their direct control.  The Bible writers never stopped coming up with new ideas on how to discipline and keep under Clergy control the people that God loves so much. The Bible writers provided all the necessary instructions for Judeo-Christianity not to function without an authoritarian Clergy organization!            Deuteronomy 17:12-13 (NIV) The man who shows contempt for the judge or for the PRIEST who stands ministering there to the Lord your God MUST BE PUT TO DEATH! You must purge the evil from Israel. ALL THE PEOPLE WILL HEAR AND BE AFRAID, AND WILL NOT BE CONTEMPTUOUS AGAIN* (*Holy Mafia talk! Most low IQ Christians of the Westboro class love it!)    Luke 16:17 (NIV) (Jesus said) It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the least stroke of a pen to drop out of the Law.    For every expression of loving recognition when you behave according to this Gods dysfunctional pleasures the Bible writers listed countless vicious warnings of punishment if you dont. Check Deut 28. The first 14 verses are teasers, but the remaining 54 verses will blow your mind! No wonder Christians hate to read the Bible. They are very content paying their tithes and offerings to the Church and letting their favorite preachers tell them what Christianity ought to be all about! They ignore that this narcissist God wants his obedient followers to be despicably cruel to the members of their own families to the extreme of killing them for any trivial matter that displeases him. In fact, God wants to have all the inhabitants of a city in Israel killed and the city totally destroyed if they begin to worship another God (Deut 13:13-19).  Even within Christianity the definition of God varies from one brand of a Christian faith to another! Only the secular law and order prevents Christians from going crazy killing anybody worshiping the wrong brand of a God.    The Bible writers say that God already destroyed the whole human race including innocent children and pregnant women once before in a big flood because they became wicked! Only a psychopathic God in the most primitive cultures would act this way (Psa 78:65, 18:7-10).  So help me God!    1 Timothy 6:20 (Infallible King James Version) O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust, AVOIDING PROFANE AND VAIN BABBLINGS, AND OPPOSITIONS OF SCIENCE FALSELY SO CALLED.     1 Corinthians 3:19-20 (Infallible King James Version) For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness. And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.    Revelation 7:1 (Infallible King James Version!) And after these things I saw four angels standing on the FOUR CORNERS of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.    So much for Christian science!|`|Wn1rtE97aa	If God wanted to "conceal things" as you cite, then why did God bother to make an orderly universe?

ahS4TuSEaa	No.  Religion provides its followers with absolutes of right and wrong, aka MORALS.    Society provides us with VALUES.  Values indicate what is important to a society and how important these things are.    Morals and values conflict when what is right is not of value to an individual or group.  When left to their own devices, people will choose what they value over what someone else says is right.    Any set of laws will change when society's values change, making the concept of right and wrong obsolete.  Consider laws about marriage, alcohol, sex, guns, drugs, even freedom of movement (The Patriot Act).|`|FD8I4zthaa	Religion isn't the answer!    Rationalism, aka science, does.

Research shows that the reason humans struggle with emotion to find equitable solutions is pinpointed the region of the brain called the insular cortex, or insula, which is also the seat of emotional reactions.    The fact that the brain has such a robust response to unfairness shows that sensing unfairness is a basic evolved capacity.     The emotional response to unfairness pushes people from extreme inequity and drives them to be fair. This observation shows our basic impulse to be fair isn't a complicated thing that we learn.    It therefore fully illustrates that all humans have morals controlled by the brain and that Christians are entirely wrong to try and claim morals as their own!!!!|`|pUIsx4Vsaa	We all do have our conscience.  That for me is made up of our ideas of right and wrong and our understanding of human values; but also a deep knowing when we are doing less than our best.

You'd think people would be able to construct some form of your question....but, (they arent strong or smart enough)....obviously.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	It's the "powerful" in your question that makes me hesitate to give the obvious answer: yes of course we can.  What we can have is a standard of right and wrong that functions as a collection of basic rules: and this will be reflected in the legislation and penal code of any civilized nation.  Religion need not come into it.    Religion at its best, however, is about setting the highest ideals we can conceive of.  For example, the Golden Rule is universal across all religious and non-religous codes of morality: be nice to people and they're more likely to be nice to you.  But the Sermon on the Mount goes much further: be nice to people even if they're not nice to you, be nice to them even if they're trying to kill you.  Now that's really powerful stuff.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Not really. "Religion" is what brought in the right and wrong. God is all right, the devil all wrong. What standard can you put yourself up against?

All of the answers to those questions can only be found in religion.|`|WcxrnINvaa	I think its called the law

379b50dce4fc66c5c2a45e76914bd311aa	>"I am talking about things like Condoms that prevent conception 100%."    firstly, NO birth control or contraceptive is 100% effective, even when used properly.   even things like tubes being tied can naturally reverse themselves. the only 100% certain way to prevent pregnancy, aside from a woman having no exposure to sperm, is for her to not have a uterus.     personally I can see why some would feel that things such as condoms would be unacceptable.    strictly speaking, one could inteperet the verses used to say masturbation is wrong, to apply to sex, when a measure is used that practicaly negates the possibility of conception.     but I think reality is such that its not really a problem.    IMO, birth control between married couples is perfectly fine.|`|J1LPzr9Vaa	wdf r u serious of course it is...  birth control condoms are fine... but abortion in the other hand isn't that's murder,,, but i understand y woman do it for many reasons so don't judge kk|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I'm fine with birth control...

Birth control is the prevention of fertilization, not the abortion of a fetus.|`|lkzTu0Qqaa	I'm not a Christian, Muslim or Jew, but I think the answer to your question is something that is entirely between you and your spouse.  Both of you have to be comfortable with the idea of birth control and the specific technique.    If you seek guidance from others you're going to get a lot of conflicting information.  One or the other of you, or both, are liable to just get confused and not be able to make a decision, or if you do make one you might later feel uncomfortable or guilty about it.    I'd suggest you discuss it with your spouse and then both decide on the approach that is acceptable and most comfortable for you both.
AA10192697	You seem to know the answer.  The Jews leaders had a huge impact in the political arena back then. There wasn't a separation between govt and religion. The Jews leaders accused Jesus of blasphemy and ordered that He be killed in order to stop His 'propaganda' and thinking that would stop more people from following Him.  They threated Pontius Pilate. Pilate wasn't a Jew and didn't see why death was necessary so he sent Jesus to the king for his decision. The king didn't want to get involved, he was also nervous of the Jews. So he sent Jesus back to Pilate.  Pilate didn't want to make this decision so he thought it would be best to let the people decide. He let them choose between Jesus, whose only sin was blasphemy (that only the Jewish priests accused Him of) and Barnabas, a multiple murderer. The people were Jews and followed their priests so they ordered Jesus to die and Barnabas to be freed (once a year Pilate freed one criminal).    It was the Romans that killed Jesus by order of the Jews.    It's an interesting historical read.  Jews won't deny this occurred but they see it as part of history and done right because they and they ancestors don't believe that Jesus is the Messiah.  It was the Roman soliders that crucified Jesus by order of Pontius Pilate due to the threats of the Jewish leaders.    As a Catholic myself, I don't say that it was the Jews that killed Jesus. I say that it was done by Roman solider under Pilate's command who was threatened by Jewish leaders.   Either way, Jesus came to earth to teach about His Father and to sacrifice Himself for our sins. So His death had to happen anyways.  And it was by His own people (He was a Jew) that fulfilled part of God's plan of salvation.    Hoped this helped somewhat.|`|38vza5Gxaa	answer: unfortunately, nothing in the gospels about "the trial" can be taken as fact.  There is a VERY long list of why the trial obviously didn't happen as described and was written down decades after the supposed facts.    Night trials were illegal in both cultures    trials in private homes were illegal     no one was condemned and crucified the same day    only rebels and murderers were crucified, not thieves or blasphemers     Rome didn't care about someone who blasphemed in a religion they didn't believe in    Pilate was one of the most cruel governors ever - he would never cave to pressure from occupied Jews.    It was NOT a custom to release a Jewish prisoner over Passover    There was only one high priest, not priests    etc etc etc    Jesus was an armed rebel - you don't clear the temple of money changers and ROMAN soldiers without a sword and armed men.  Rome frowned on that and executed those that tried it.|`|wOA2Mf6Naa	They choose to let Barabbas free and let Jesus die. The Romans (Pontius Pilatus) gave them the choice.|`|ATPPWOpWaa	You try to find the answer on line?  Try the Bible.    The Jews had Jesus Killed by influencing the local Roman governor(Pilate).    Jon 19   19Pilate had a notice prepared and fastened to the cross. It read:|sc JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 20Many of the Jews read this sign, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Aramaic, Latin and Greek. 21The chief priests of the Jews protested to Pilate, "Do not write 'The King of the Jews,' but that this man claimed to be king of the Jews."|`|nrdPJvufaa	It doesn't matter who killed Jesus.

All the world is guilty before YHWH God.|`|AA11047076	The New Testament is far from accurate about Judaism or Jewish beliefs.  it is obvious that it is written to deflect the blame from the Romans and onto the Jews since the Jews had rejected Jesus and the authors were trying to convert the Romans    The gospel account of Jesus' death is laughable when you look at the Jewishlaw (you know- the one that the Gospels state the Pharisees were so intent on keeping!)  1) A trial for a capital crime has to be heard during the day- the trial in the gospels happens at night  2) A trial for a capital crime in Jerusalem could only be heard in the Chamber of Stone in the Temple- the trial in the gospels takes place in a private home  3) A full Sanhedrin of 70 Judges heard capital crimes in Jerusalem- in the gospels only a few judges are present.  4) Two witnesses who are certain and cannot contradict each other are needed. If they are not certain or contradict each other they are put on trial! - in the gospels the witnesses arrive late in the trial and are uncertain.  5) The person has to be warned by the witnesses IMMEDIATELY before the crime that they are engaging in a capital offense- no warnings are given in the gospels and the witnesees aren't even present when the trial starts!  6) The accused has to have acknowledged the warning and still continued to do the crime in front of the two people that warned him- in the gospels no warning or acknowledgement of warning is ever given  6) If somebody is not convicted by a Sanhedrin- it is FORBIDDEN to hand them over to secualr authorities.  7) Crucifixion was a Roman punishment- it was NEVER used by Jews  8) Pontius Pilates was an absolute ruler who was exceptionally cruel- so much so that he was removed from power for excessive cruelty by the Roman government.  (one wonders at how bad he must have been to offend the sensibilities of people who saw rape, killing children and torture as valid tools of politics!)  There is no reason for him to agree to anything from a powerless group of Jews who had no means of getting him to do anything at all!|`|O1zVSQSQaa	julius Cesar was responsible along with the Romans and the nonbelievers|`|AA10468529	in the bible at John 5:16-8 it says "...on this account the Jews went persecuting Jesus, because he was doing these things during Sabbath.?But he answered them: My Father has kept working until now, and I keep working.?On this account, indeed, the Jews began seeking all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath but he was also calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God." so here it says that they were seeking to kill him even though no fault was found in him.|`|E9chZY74aa	The Jews cried for His crucifixion, but the Romans actually nailed Him.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!

Who lied to you and told you differently.|`|atfKCzmPaa	The Fight to Do What Is Right--AS LONG AS Satans world exists, Christians must fight to keep free from its wicked influence. The apostle Paul wrote: Put on the complete suit of armor from God that you may be able to stand firm against the [crafty acts] of the Devil. (Ephesians 6:11-18) However, our fight is not only against Satan and his world; it is also against our own desires to do what is bad. The Bible says: The inclination of the heart of man is bad from his youth up.Genesis 8:21; Romans 5:12.  Because of the sin inherited from the first man Adam, our hearts may crave to do what is bad. If we give in to that craving, we will not receive everlasting life in Gods new system. So we need to fight to do what is right. Even the apostle Paul had such a fight, as he explained: When I wish to do what is right, what is bad is present with me. (Romans 7:21-23) You, too, may find this fight a hard one. At times a powerful conflict may be going on within you. What will you then decide to do?  You have come to know of Gods wonderful promises about living forever under perfect conditions on earth. You believe these promises, and you want these good things for yourself. So you know that it is in your lasting best interest to serve God. But in your heart you may desire things that you know are bad. At times you may have a strong desire to commit fornication, to steal, or to take part in other wrongdoing. Some persons studying this book may actually be engaging in such bad practices, though they know that these things are condemned by God. The fact that they do wrong when they wish to do right demonstrates the Bible truth: The heart is more treacherous than anything else and is desperate.Jeremiah 17:9.  THE FIGHT CAN BE WON--This does not mean, however, that a person has no control over his strong desires to do wrong. If you really want to, you can strengthen your heart so that it will lead you in a right way. But it is up to you to do this. (Psalm 26:1,?11) Nobody else can win the fight for you. So, first of all, continue to take in life-giving Bible knowledge. (John 17:3) Yet more is needed than simply getting that knowledge into your head. It must also sink into your heart. You must come to have a deep feeling about what you are learning so that you really want to act upon it.  But how can you gain heart appreciation for Gods laws? You need to meditate, or think deeply, about them. For example, ask yourself: What difference does obeying God really make? Then look at the lives of people who have ignored his laws, such as the 19-year-old girl who wrote: I have had a venereal disease three times. The last time it cost me my right to bear children because I had to have a hysterectomy. It is truly sad to consider all the trouble that is caused when people disobey Gods laws. (2?Samuel 13:1-19) A woman who had committed fornication sadly said: Its just not worth the pain and emotional breakdown that comes with disobedience. Im suffering for that now. Yet you will hear people say that fornication, as well as getting drunk and taking drugs, is fun. But the so-called fun is only temporary. Do not be misled into a course of action that will rob you of true and lasting happiness. Think of Moses who was raised as the son of the daughter of Pharaoh. He lived in the richness of the royal household there in ancient Egypt. However, the Bible says that, when he grew up, he chose to be ill-treated with the people of God rather than to have the temporary enjoyment of sin. (Hebrews 11:24,?25) So there must have been enjoyment or fun in the immoral, loose-living way of life that apparently existed among the Egyptian royal household. Why, then, did Moses turn away from all of it?  It is because Moses believed in Jehovah God. And he knew about something far better than any temporary enjoyment of sin that he might experience in the Egyptian royal household. The Bible says: He looked intently toward the payment of the reward. Moses meditated, or thought deeply, about the things that God had promised. He had faith in Gods purpose to create a righteous new system. His heart was touched by Jehovahs great love and care for humankind. It was not simply that Moses had heard or read about Jehovah. The Bible says that he continued steadfast as seeing the One who is invisible. (Hebrews 11:26,?27) Jehovah was real to Moses, and so were his promises of everlasting life.  Is that true of you? Do you view Jehovah as a real Person, as a Father who loves you? When you read about his promises to provide everlasting life in Paradise on earth, do you picture yourself being there enjoying these blessings? (See pages 156 to 162.) To win the fight against the many pressures to do wrong, we need to have a close relationship with Jehovah. And we need to look, as Moses did, intently toward the payment of the reward. A 20-year-old youth, who was faced with the temptation to commit fornication, had Moses viewpoint. He said: My hope|`|AA11849917	Are you asking why Christianity says that people are bad?  Well, do you know ANY body who has NEVER told a lie?  or NEVER taken something that wasn't rightfully theirs to take?  Have YOU ever looked at anyone with sexual thoughts?  (Yes, I DO have to quote Jesus on this one, because He said that to God, this is the same as adultery!)  Well, just looking at these three things alone, that would make some one a lying, thieving adulterer!  How is that NOT bad?    And then, what about the lies you've told; do you want others to lie to YOU?  if you've ever taken anything that wasn't rightfully yours to take, do you want anyone to steal YOUR stuff?  If you answered "no" to either of these, that means you have a double standard, and that's called "hypocrisy!"    Now, you become a lying, thieving, adulterous, hypocrite!  (*OUCH*)    NOW, if you STILL think that doesn't make you a bad person, then you can add to the list, "self-righteous" and "holier-than-thou!"    Now you become a self-righteous, holier-than-thou, hypocritical, lying, thieving adulterer!  (*DOUBLE OUCH!*)    Shall I go on and talk about disobedience to parents or other authorities?  Shall I talk about bad thoughts, bad attitudes, bad motives and intentions?  What about greed, envy, jealousy and selfishness?  How about anger and hate towards others?  Do you think that these things makes a person NOT bad?    Without using any Scriptures, it is self-apparent that every human being has violated their own conscience - on more than one occasion, and such violation is indicative that any HIGHER form of morality would also be broken in the process.  We make excuses for our own failings, but accuse others of theirs!  When we accuse someone of wrong doing, that proves that we KNOW it's wrong.  When we eventually do the very thing we condemned in others, that makes US guilty of the very same thing, even when we DO make excuses.    There is none that is good, no not one!  To be "good", one must be good 100% of the time, their entire life!      I read a question here in R&S in which the asker pointed out that she was good MOST of the time.  Doesn't that show that she isn't good ALL the time?      Now, think about this for a moment.  If you're driving along in your car, and you fail to stop at a signal light when the light is red, you become guilty of running a red light.     Question:  How many red lights must you stop at to compensate for the one you did NOT stop at?    Answer:  You can't!  Each red light must be stopped at for its OWN sake!      Likewise, how many truths must you tell to compensate for one lie?  Answer:  You can't!  Each truth must be told for its OWN sake.    Both the red light, the lie, and any other thing you may have done wrong (call someone a name, gossip about someone, treat someone badly, etc, etc, etc), once done, can NEVER be undone!    You can not stop at a red light to compensate for a previous one you did NOT stop at!  Each red light (again) must be stopped at for its OWN sake.    Now, apply this same concept to EVERY moral law, and pretty soon you realize that we don't live in a world of scales, the good balancing the bad; but rather, we live in a world of absolutes, in which every time you do something wrong, it adds to your total tally of bad things you've done, and no amount of good can bring the scale back into balance.    Like I said, there is none good, no not one.  You will not find a single person who has not in one way or another violated a basic moral code of conduct or behavior, either through their actions, attitudes, thoughts, intentions, emotions, or attitudes!    This is one way to look at the Christian stand on good and bad.  You may not like it, but it is true - "ALL have sinned and fall short of God's expectations for us"  "There is none good, no not one!"      And only Jesus can forgive us for those bad things (called "sins"), and set us free from the consequences of those sins, clean us (spiritually speaking) from those sins, give us a new "slate" (wiping out all the bad things we've ever done), and set us free from the power that sin has over us.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	if they use it to justify ignorance or intolerance.

Genesis 31:19, 34-35 (NIV) When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel stole her father's household gods* (*dildos in the form of idols). [34-35] Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them inside her camel's saddle and was sitting on them. Laban searched through everything in the tent but found nothing. Rachel said to her father, "Don't be angry, my lord, that I cannot stand up in your presence; I'm having my period."* (*she was probably very juicy already!) So he searched but could not find the household gods.* (*funny, because the law of God about staying away from a woman having a period was not even in effect yet, but the Bible writers made it look like it was!)     Let me find some more...    The Bible God is a primitive sadistic killer worse than any of the Heathen Gods in history. He wants anybody killed for any trivial matter! Every time that there is a woman to be stoned to death for adultery or for being promiscuous no thought is ever given in the whole bible about the great possibility that the lady may be pregnant. As you probably know, they wore no condoms in those days! Regardless of how late is the pregnancy, God ALWAYS wants the fetus destroyed inside of the womb of the pregnant woman when she is burned alive or stoned to death! Sometimes the pregnancy is discovered several months after the sexual act took place like in the case of the Virgin Mary. So only the lady with the fetus inside her womb is present to be stoned to death! NO THOUGHT IS EVER GIVEN IN THE BIBLE ABOUT SAVING THE FETUS FOR ANYTHING!!! God wants the brides that are not virgin on their wedding day to be stoned to death, too! The parents of the bride must ALWAYS keep the last period tampon at hand especially during the wedding day otherwise the wedding party might turn into a pregnant Bride stoning party! Christianity is so stupid no to read the Bible for themselves. They rather let the freeloader smiley specially trained preachers do it for them!    Deuteronomy 22:20-21 (NIV) If, however, the charge is true and no proof of the girl's virginity can be found* (*UNLIKE IN THE SECULAR USA, IN THE BIBLE A PERSON IS GUILTY SINNER UNTIL PROVEN INNOCENT!), she shall be brought to the door of her father's house and there the men of her town shall stone her to death. She has done a disgraceful thing in Israel by being promiscuous while still in her father's house. You must purge the evil from among you.    If no evidence of virginity is readily available on the wedding day the bride is assumed to be pregnant and God will be very pleased to see that the promiscuous bride with the fetus inside her womb be stoned to death that very day of the wedding! This is probably the case of Sarah Palin! Her first son was born 8 months after her eloping and marriage to Todd (Newsweek page 31 - 9/15/08).  The same is true of her daughter Bristol. She is single and promiscuously pregnant! In Bible times Bristol would be stoned to death to purge the evil from among us in this ONE NATION UNDER GOD!!! BUT GOD CANT CARE LESS ABOUT THEIR FETUSES!!! In fact, there is no death sentence ever handed down for abortionists in the whole Bible.|`|Z391sLTcaa	why worry about whether the bible mentions it?|`|pRF5LLloaa	Genesis 31:35  Leviticus 12:2  Leviticus 12:5  Leviticus 12:7  Leviticus 15:19  Leviticus 15:20  Leviticus 15:25  Leviticus 15:26  Leviticus 15:33  Leviticus 18:19  Leviticus 20:18|`|I15chbBhaa	Lev.15:19- 24

h2HxsSJ5aa	There are two types of gambling.  In one, people gamble against each other.  In that situation, there is at least no exploitation most of the time, but it still abstracts money, or whatever else is being won and lost, from its true value.  That is, whereas you could pay someone for the work they've done, perhaps through buying, say, a loaf of bread, you aren't doing this when you gamble.  The same applies to interest on bank loans and credit, for example.  In the other type of gambling, it isn't so much wrong as deeply irrational.  An organisation which profits from gambling exists solely to exploit those who participate in it.  It could not exist unless the odds were in its favour.  Therefore it makes no sense to gamble.|`|fd5f2954d03f8ed32926400fe1b18cfcaa	I won $1700.00 on a penny slot a couple of weeks ago.

hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I am a convert.

There is not one single mention of Jesus in the entire Roman record - that is right - not one!!! At the same time as he was supposed to have been around there were a number of Jews claiming to be the messiah - all of whom are well recorded!!    He was supposed to have been a huge problem to the Romans and produced wonderful miracles but still not one contemporary record?    Even the bible mentions of him like all other references were not written until many years after his supposed death!!    At best he was an amalgam of those others!!    Pilot is recorded in the Roman record as a somewhat lack luster man but no mention of a Jesus, a trial or crucifixion that would surely have been used to make him look brighter!!      The Roman Emperor Constantine produced the bible and he was a pagan not god!!!   He also organized Christianity into the Holly Roman Catholic Church!!  Not in Israel or any of the countries of supposed origin but entirely Italian!!    Not one word of it is contemporary with the period and was not written until many years after the period the story is set in!!    What a wonder full disinformation and deception campaign he waged against his Christian enemies - so good in fact that Christians are still following the deception to this day!!!|`|NYGDQ3ezaa	I am a Christian. I learned that God is holy, eternal, perfect, love. God wants us to go to heaven to be with Him forever after we die. However, we aren't prefect, for sure. So, God sent us His Son, Jesus Christ, as the bridge to God. We need to accept Jesus into our life as our Lord and Savior forever to be a Christian. When this happens, we receive God's guidance and protection, forgiveness and blessing and go to heaven to be with God forever after we die. Jesus came to earth as an example of how to live and to be the sacrifice for our sins in this world.  Jesus died on the cross for us. He was born to the virgin Mary and had God's Holy Spirit as His Father. He took on our sins at the cross when He died, even though He was sinless. Jesus ascended to heaven to be with God the Father, and Christians believe Jesus will return to earth at the end of the world.   Faith in God is a gift from God. If you are seeking God, you could pray for the faith to believe in God, preferably by praying with a Christian.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	I regard Christianity as irrelevant and I respect the moral teachings of Christ.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Christianity is a lifestyle.

If you really follow Jesus, you'll love others more than yourself, which would make the world a much better place.

There is too much old covenant seeping into the new covenant... even church buildings are a reconstruction of what God destroyed so that He could dwell in "living" stones...     Also, many Christians have warped Christianity because they read the Bible text as though it's addressed to us living today.  This is 2000 year old mail, divinely inspired and addressed directly to Jesus' contemporaries.  It is profitable for instruction and can apply to all generations, but it is NOT written directly to us.  This principle is called "audience relevance" and most Christians don't even know about that key to interpretation.      The Gospel (Good News) is actually a LOT better than what most Christians preach it to be... they are stuck in the "already but not yet" mentality, between old covenant and new covenant... when in reality, the old covenant has been obsolete since the Roman Jewish War in the first century.  God has indeed completed redemption, and fulfilled all that He said He would do... His Kingdom has fully come but most Christians would say it hasn't yet, because they're looking for a physical kingdom, instead of the spiritual kingdom Jesus said it was.    Truly, Christians don't do Christianity justice... we think we know everything, only to find out we were wrong years later.  We need to have an open mind, a teachable spirit, and keep seeking for better ways to represent this glorious and gracious gift God bestowed upon humanity through the work of Jesus.|`|t88527U1aa	Christianity is following Christ that we fail should be no surprise it did not surprise Jesus nor should it surprise you.  For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, As much as we try we will fail Christ asks us to forget what is behind and follow him we try the best as we can, He gave us the gift of life everlasting. Forgive us as we attempt to follow him because we fail,he knew we would and still loves us, Keep our eyes on Christ or we sink!

AA11245447	Let's try and clear this up, although Honi gave a thorough answer.  Judaism is a religion and a tribe/nation/community.    We are NOT a race - that was perpetrated by Hitler and the Vichy government, among others.  We are not an ethnicity, since we encompass many ethnicities; an Ethiopian Jew will have different customs than a Ashkenasi Jew (Eastern European), for example.  Also, you can convert to Judaism and you cannot convert to a race.    For information, check out:  http://whatjewsbelieve.org/|`|5f80f1f151b797b394930ab7261f6128aa	In traditional anthropological studies there are actually 5 races.   These are  1) Mongoloid (Asian and American Indian)  2) Caucasoid (European)  3) Australoid (Australian and oceanic)  4) Negroid (east African black)  5) Capoid (south African black)    Jews are not a race nor an ethnicity.  One can convert to Judaism but one cannot convert to another race.  As to ethnicity, I am an Ashkenazi Jew whose ethnicity is Russian/Polish/Hungarian.  I have Jewish friends are are Sephardi and their ethnicity is Spanish.  I know Jews whose ancestors came from Armenia or India and so Armenian or Indian is their ethnicity.  It seems to be extremely difficult for people to understand what Judaism really is.  Yes, of course, it is a religion.  It is also a tribal nation; not a country but a nation of people.  Hitler tried to put forth the proposition that Jews were a race...a genetically inferior race...and that's why it was easy for him and Germany to do what they did.  He also thought that Romas were a race.      And this is what most Jews, more or less, believe:  1. I believe with perfect faith that G-d is the Creator and Ruler of all things. He alone has made, does make, and will make all things.     2. I believe with perfect faith that G-d is One. There is no unity that is in any way like His. He alone is our G-d He was, He is, and He will be.     3. I believe with perfect faith that G-d does not have a body. physical concepts do not apply to Him. There is nothing whatsoever that resembles Him at all.     4. I believe with perfect faith that G-d is first and last.     5. I believe with perfect faith that it is only proper to pray to G-d. One may not pray to anyone or anything else.     6. I believe with perfect faith that all the words of the prophets are true.     7. I believe with perfect faith that the prophecy of Moses is absolutely true. He was the chief of all prophets, both before and after Him.     8. I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah that we now have is that which was given to Moses.     9. I believe with perfect faith that this Torah will not be changed, and that there will never be another given by G-d.     10. I believe with perfect faith that G-d knows all of man's deeds and thoughts. It is thus written (Psalm 33:15), "He has molded every heart together, He understands what each one does."     11. I believe with perfect faith that G-d rewards those who keep His commandments, and punishes those who transgress Him.    12. I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Messiah. How long it takes, I will await His coming every day.     13. I believe with perfect faith that the dead will be brought back to life when G-d wills it to happen.|`|LjsRfaskaa	Judaism is a religion not a race of people.

Anyone can convert to Judaism, and there are Jewish people of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds.  My race is Caucasion, my ethnicity is Polish and Syrian, and my religion is Judaism.    To fix up some other misconceptions:     - Christianity is the religion   - Christians is the plural word for followers of the religion  - A Christian is the singular term for a follower of that religion    - Judaism is the religion.  - Jewish people or Jews is the plural word for followers of the religion  - A Jew or A Jewish person, is the singular term for a follower of that religion     One can be Jewish two ways: They convert to the religion, or their mother is Jewish.  According to Jewish law, if someone's mother is Jewish, they are as well: However, should they decide to take up another belief they are considered an apostate, and cut off from Judaism.    Now, that this is out of the way:    We believe in the following:    - The 613 commandments are forever binding to the Jewish people.   - That there is one God  - God has no shape/form/gender  - We follow the Written Law (Torah) and Oral Law (Talmud)  - All people are to be respected  - There are many paths to God  - All individuals are born with a clean slate in life    What we don't believe in:    - Jesus as a Messiah/prophet/semi-Deity (Jesus has nothing to do with Judaism: "Messianic Judaism" is a Christian Evangelical branch)  - The Holy Spirit or the Trinity  - The Christian concept of Heaven/Hell  - Original Sin  - The New Testament|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	It's an ethnic group.  There is only one race, the human race.  .|`|vNGjgygCaa	Its an Ethnicity.|`|yY1YfJwQaa	not a race|`|g5Dh6MSYaa	Yes, Jew is sonsidered a race, it was the first race to start religion. The Jewish belief is like a Christians but they believe that Jesus was a prophet, not the messiah or the person to save them and end the world. They believe that the mesiah will come on judgement day. That is all. Both the Old testement of the bibile and the jewish bible the torah, are exactly the same.|`|8r5eqShbaa	Why ask this on the sabbath?    It's not an ethnicity, race, etcetera. It's a religion. What these people are telling you is a myth spread by the catholic church and people like Hitler.|`|x6xOlJfmaa	The race is Jewish the religion is Judaism.    You are Jewish though if you convert to Judaism so I guess it is both COOL :)
i0OVwfcyaa	So your friend was walking towards your house because he needed help?  Oh yeah, it *must* be divine....
ahS4TuSEaa	The Apostle Paul is quoting the Old Testament and applying it to the New Testament church in a different way (I'll leave you the link so you can see for yourself).    Both examples deal with holiness (setting apart oneself for God) and sanctification (keeping oneself clean for God).    In the Old Testament, God is referring to his children who are living under Babylonian rule as punishment for their lack of holiness and sanctification.  God wants them to repent (turn from their sinful ways) and return to Him so that they can be reconciled with God (for God the Father cannot even look upon unholiness).    In the New Testament, the Apostle Paul is appealing to new converts in the city of Corinth.  He is warning the assembly (literally means, "a calling out") not to associate or get married to people who idolize things like sex, pleasure, power/famous people, money, etc., for it will corrupt the worshipers of God and make them dirty with sin and unholy to God.      That is why it is important to keep the church pure and holy--so that we may maintain a good and healthy relationship with God the Father through the Holy Spirit and receive forgiveness and cleansing from Jesus Christ, our redeemer and savior.|`|Lc5FtItDaa	Don't live like unbelievers.  Don't defile yourself with sin.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Unclean thing means anything sinful.    It's applicable today & not impossible.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Yes, we are not to be bound together with unbelievers. It's just as true today as in the Early years of the first church.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	What kind of alliances can the saints make with unbelievers and still find favor in the Lord's eyes? Can they marry out of the Church? Or join secret and oath-bound organizations? Or compromise church standards on moral issues? Can they join the Communist party? Or send their young children to, say, a Catholic school if not Catholic where they will be taught the catechisms of that organization?   What associations can the saints maintain with outsiders without departing from gospel standards? Can they participate in cocktail parties? Publish pornographic literature? Attend indecent plays and movies? Work for institutions whose major purpose is to fight the truth and destroy the influence of the Church?       To Israel, by the mouth of Moses, God said: "And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people" (Lev. 26:12), which Paul interpreted to mean that God, by the power of his Spirit, would dwell in his people.       To latter-day Israel, from the lips of Isaiah, speaking of fleeing from Babylon and gathering to Zion, the Lord said: "Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord" (Isa. 52:11), which Paul applied to the need of the saints in his day to be separate from the world.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	We are to separate ourselves from any sin or sinful thing. If you are hanging with your friends and they start drinking alcohol you are to leave and remove yourself from them. We are to do this to remove ourselves from temptation. If you are somewhere with friends and you know they are having sex or doing drugs you need to leave and not be friends with them because they will encourage you to do things you know are wrong. God gives us these rules to protect us from harm all the actions are harmful to us and our bodies which are Gods temple. It requires us to make some painful choices but we will be better for it, and it will be a positive message to your friends and might give someone that doesn't have your strength and courage to act for themselves. If you have no absolute standards of behavior and what is right and wrong, than nothing is right or wrong. If you do have standards than you need to take that stand and do not compromise for anyone or anything.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	There's probably a reference here to Isaiah 52.11    Depart, depart, go out from there!  Touch no unclean thing;  go out from the midst of it, purify yourselves,  you who carry the vessels of the LORD.    where the context is the release from exile.  The Lord's people are to leave as quickly as possible and not contaminate themselves by touching the artifacts of the alien religion of their captors.    In the Corinthian Church Paul is very aware of the potentially contaminating influence of other religions, and pleads with his readers to be clear in their minds as to what Christianity does and does not permit.  So he draws a parallel with Israel's history: the people could only preserve themselves by reducing contact with the surrounding culture to a minimum.    The easiest way to apply the verse today is to withdraw into a closed community - monastery or some equivalent.  For most of us that's not possible or desirable, so we are always having to weigh up what in the culture that surrounds us can be part of our lives as Christians, absorbed into what we do in church, and what needs to be rejected.    What "contaminates" you as a Christian?  What makes you feel "unclean"?  Everyone will give a different answer to this, but the question is certainly relevant and worth asking.    BTW PLEASE use a decent translation of the Bible!  KJV is so inadequate, certainly for study purposes.|`|rXqtMHHBaa	It is talking about false religion...get out of it and stay away from false religion
Op81lhjuaa	God is a jealous God.  You shall have no other gods in your life.  What takes your time?  Do you think about Jesus every day?  If not, what do you think  about?  Money?  TV?  Work? Or something else? Maybe that is  your god.     How much time do you give to Jesus each week?  If you truly love  something, it consumes your time.    I think when we become more and more consumed by God the less we will be conformed to the world. The biggest battle for a Christian is the flesh. We need to be separate in our thinking and our action will follow. It all starts with the thoughts in our minds. I fail everyday but I am still growing in Christ. I strive to be holy as the Lord is holy. I hope this answered your question and I did not go off it to far!  God Bless!|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	I answered that in your previous question.|`|iHDYncuXaa	Stay away from places that the unbelievers hang out such as porn shops, bars, drug allies, casinos, strip clubs, etc. Don't be part of their "world".|`|MMImKRAgaa	come or leave an corrupt doctrine, you have to understand that this type of doctrine is only concerned what belief structure you have|`|f1ef0ec0c485ab4d456dfa6f21af33e6aa	It has nothing to do with any race of people. Paul was referring to the sin world and asked us to come out of it and be clean which means a salvation cleansing. That is the only way that the Lord will receive us into the kingdom.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	We are, by our nature, living in the world. However, we do not need to be part of the world.    It simply means that we do not have to give into the temptations of the flesh (the world), that we can live without taking part in acts that are of the world.|`|y9bbLn7qaa	Paul wrote to the Corinthian church because they (after the church was established) was incorporating pagan practices. Paul was saying and using Isaiah 52:11 for back up, that they should disengage from all forms of false religion and make a clean break from all sinful habits and idolatrous pattern. "Be Separate" was a command for believers to be as Christ was.|`|FOCPDsxbaa	Not all religions are approved by God,There are false religions with false practices , doctrines and traditions which actually have nothing to do with the bible or God, when you leave that religion leave all of it and stop celebrating it's traditions and holidays. Mathew 7:13,21-24, ..and stop touching that unclean thing, John4:24|`|E9chZY74aa	No.  There is no need for special dress or living in  a commune.  It is the thinking that separates you.  The world will see that you are odd, that you are unique.  It is by your actions, your thinking in the way you do, see, talk to, act, feel, respond, and so on.  That is how one is separate and comes out from among them.  We can not live separate, but we are separate in our thinking.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	so your real question is "do you have a Bible handy?"|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Be of the world but not a participant in it.  Serve the world but don't become part of it.  Live a good, righteous, prayerful life while the world around you falls apart.  In other words center your life and thoughts on Christ and what he has done, have faith in him, and have hope.    Hope is not knowledge, but rather the abiding trust that the Lord will fulfill His promise to us. It is confidence that if we live according to Gods laws and the words of His prophets now, we will receive desired blessings in the future. It is believing and expecting that our prayers will be answered. It is manifest in confidence, optimism, enthusiasm, and patient perseverance.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Your question is vague.  I recommend reading the whole Chapter and not just one bit.  But, the separation is in oneself and leaving the old life behind.  When you leave the darkness you were in you do not take any of it with you.  Follow God and his ways not the ways of your past.|`|799756bd4c88f2ce87a508802ca1e9cdaa	Well what we do in our house is use our spiritual discernment by changing the channel if something sinful is on the television.  We also practice this in all areas of our lives like internet, radio, etc.

6354f9b17eeb910a803f8ef20a4505afaa	There is a lot of suffering in this world and it does not do us good to know about it.  Learning about evil comes with knowledge and wisdom and this is annoying and disturbing.      Jesus told us to "look on what is good, what is pure, what is right and of good report."  It is always best to focus on good and not evil.    I believe Einstein would have agreed, because when asked how many pints in a quart Einstein replied that he didn't clutter his mind with such.  That he could always look that up in a dictionary.|`|v9M6BpEpaa	No He Licked It :p|`|AA11849917	I don't know.

AA12181796	Yes, but deities do not need to be involved for me to feel that way. It seems to me that those who ask atheists what the point of life is if they don't believe in deities are the ones who take this life for granted, because apparently the only reason they think it's worth living is that they think they'll be getting something better when they die. I believe we probably get one shot at life, so we should live it to the full.|`|Eos7bQKRaa	every thing's a miracle when u don't understand it|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	You should have known better than to ask this question to an atheist.|`|OZ2Ass9iaa	What?

That's enough for me.|`|AA11297267	If by "miracle" you mean a magical thing outside of natural laws done by a supernatural being -- no, I don't think life is a miracle.  Why?  Because there's no evidence that anything magical or supernatural is involved in any way.    Special?  Sure it is.  Our planet is the only one in our solar system (that we know of) that has life on it.  That's special.  There have been lots of disasters in our planet's history that did wipe out a lot of the life on it, and could possibly have wiped out all life -- we're fortunate that life is so tenacious, and we're fortunate to be around to enjoy having a life.      That doesn't mean there's any magic or anything supernatural involved.    Peace.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	yoo-hoooooo!!....

It's religions, like Christianity, that attempt to remove the importance of life.    They put all the focus on and essentially attempt to make people believe the only true meaning of life is death.    Waste your life serving God, forget anything else (its all sinful), and you will be rewarded with a great afterlife, or punished with eternal hell. But no part of these type of religions puts any importance on life.    As an atheist I believe this is the only life we get, so it must be made the best off. There is no eternal damnation or pearly gates for me, just this little span of existence here and now.    So I spend time with my daughter, I attempt to make enough money to stay comfortable, I take as many experiences in as I can. That seems pretty special to me|`|InkQ02Qvaa	Nope. Babies are born everyday. That doesn't make them special. It's nature...not a miracle.|`|wia35rNKaa	As an atheist...I recently attended a catholic mass because one of my friends was getting married. I did not do anything besides standing up and peace sign...no sign of cross, none of the other "rituals and traditions" which is all that church is nowadays...and ever has been.    As I watched all the people folowing and reciting everything that they were supposed to be, I had to smile and laugh at how I used to do that for so many years, never stopping and realizing how ridiculous it all was.    The capper for me was when they started singing...."God is kind and merciful."  This is in New Orleans, and in Louisiana, in America on this planet.    If god is kind and merciful, then what the hell was he doing while people died in Katrina, while people die everyday get killed, shot at, get sick, raped, beaten up, molested, lied to, cheated on, and every other atrocity.    If god is all powerful, then maybe he should look around and see what is going on.    So, no, I dont ever fell that life is a miracle and special.  I feel like I am lucky to have avoided a lot of stuff happening to me that I have no control over in the first place...and also feel lucky that I can do like most other people in this world and stick my head in the sand and worry about my little triival problems, while government officials do nothing to help and control and the solve the problems that really face this planet...black, white, american, african, chrisitan muslim, etc etc etc and religious people go and on about an ideal, perfect world, instead of taking real action to solving problems.    God is made up...people are wicked.
OFCCgLdKaa	Why don't you take a different subject instead of a language?    I did German, it's pretty easy, I got 3 marks of a C without revising or paying attention in my lessons.

Anyway, if you already know Italian ("notte") it will more simple to you to remind yourself that the final letter is a "t".  - French conjugation shares a lot of things with Italian and vice-versa;  - Words gender are very similar in both the languages.

Just be sure that you know what you are choosing between.  "Heaven" is spending eternity in the presence of God.  Every good thing that we enjoy here on earth is just a small refection of the nature and character of God. Every beautiful sunset, every quiet walk through a sweet-smelling forest, every perfect cappuccino or fabulous chocolate shake, every night spent laughing with friends or walking hand-in-hand with the one you love--everything wonderful comes from God, and heaven will be all those things--multiplied.     "Hell" will be spending eternity apart from God and all that comes from Him.  Take everything that is good and wonderful out of this world, and that will be what it will be like to be completely separated from God.  What will be left?  Injustice, greed, anxiety, anger, bitterness, deception, oppression, torture, cruelty, all kinds of foul-smelling filth, humiliation, and on and on.    Choose wisely.      I'm choosing to follow after Jesus, to trust in salvation through His shed blood, and to go to "heaven" and spend eternity with God.  I hope to see you there.|`|98290704c24fd02cca24498a78259fadaa	I agree.  It sounds kinda boring.  Except for the floating up there part.

d4bd8b0d4b217939ff505d70042c7c38aa	While I do not know the movie you may be referring to, in the "olden days," there were people who were "sin eaters."  However, if this concept was twisted by a movie's idea of what Sin Eaters were, then that will color your thinking.    According to Wikipedia, the term sin-eater refers to a person who, through ritual means, would take on by means of food and drink the sins of a deceased person, thus absolving his or her soul and allowing that person to rest in peace. Sin-eating is a form of religious magic, part of the study of folklore. This is similar to the religious ceremony of the scape-goat which was once a part of the ceremonies of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, in Judaism.    This practice was said to have been practiced in parts of England and Scotland, and allegedly survived until modern times in Wales. Traditionally, it is performed by a beggar and certain villages maintained their own sin-eaters. They would be brought to the dying person's bedside, where a relative would place a crust of bread on the breast of the dying and pass a bowl of ale to him over the corpse. After praying or reciting the ritual, he would then drink and remove the bread from the breast and eat it, the act of which would remove the sin from the dying person and take it into himself.    It's very similar to the Lord's Supper, where Christians consume the body/bread and blood/wine of Christ, as a sin of the atonement for sin of Christ's death and resurrection.    I hope this helps you understand exactly what Sin Eaters WERE.    As for BELIEVING in them, that's your choice.  As for me and my family, we DON'T believe!|`|e4ea78f84797a325a8f09288df4483a4aa	No... it was a pretty trippy movie though|`|3313e1c5bf78183621f294d9399a3e04aa	Whatever it is I'm sure it is very real now that it was imagined into your universe.|`|AA10550142	Do people believe?

ahS4TuSEaa	Being Agnostic means that you neither believe nor disbelieve in God.  I think you should respect your mother's wishes and go with her to church, if for no other reason than to comfort your mother.    Death may seem so far away to you, but when a mother dies, death comes very close to a daughter's heart.  It gives your mother assurance that there is a loving God there to welcome her mother and she wants this for you too.    So, as long as you live under your mother's roof, go with her to church.  Look and listen and ask questions when you feel the need to ask.  Examine this one they call Jesus and see if you can find fault in him.    Consider that no one before you could find fault in him, yet humanity condemned him to death on a cross.  If you are still an agnostic after this church experience, at least you can say that you listened  and gave it a chance, which is more than most people can say today.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Religion is for the weak.

If so this may diminish with time.      If you mom wants you to go to church with her and you're still living at home, I would do it. She's still your guardian so has more say in what you do than she would otherwise.  Once you move out you can go to church or not as you please.  If your mom is sad and worried and you refuse to go to church absolutely that will make her more sad and worried, while going costs you some leisure time but will make her happier.      Going to church doesn't mean you have to believe in God, lots of people go every week and don't believe at all.|`|3df06b65831ca89dcc296c573d4605b4aa	Write the letter.|`|Fdo2G5BZaa	You have my condolences on the loss of your Grandmother... I can assure you that if your grandmother was of The Christian Faith that she is very happy right now... but I understand  your sadness for your loss.    I am of The True Christian Faith... and I can tell you that no one can force you to be a Christian... your parents may require you to obey and go with them... but NO ONE may compel any one to be a Christian... ONLY God may decree any one to be of The True Church(The True Christian Faith)....     I think you should obey your parents... be polite at Church... but no one of The True Faith may compel you to participate beyond the norm of politeness... No True Christian will compel you to participate    I think you should... but it must be your choice between God and you    I do invite you to visit my site and if you have any questions concerning the basics of The True Christian Faith feel free to contact me from the site...  http://www.mikesfaith.com|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	"Mom, Love for God cannot be forced, commanded or demanded."

Since she is your mom it wouldn't hurt to try out church a few times, there really isn't anything wrong about hearing what other religions have to say, otherwise how would you be able to defend your own religion effectively? I myself am a Christian but i also know it can get annoying having other people FORCE things on you. But its good to hear everyone's point of view.

To focus your attention, then she can do that, but it is still up to you to decide for yourself. Being forced to go to church is only going to make you resent her and the church, nothing else.    Maybe ask your mother to respect your beliefs or lack of them.    Sorry that people feel it appropriate to patronise you. Their is no lower age limit to think for yourself.|`|wia35rNKaa	well since chritianity would not have existed without judeaism...and one of god's law was that you should honor/listen to, etc your parents, if you dont listen to her, tell her she should just go ahead and stone you like her God said so 2000+ years ago for not obeying your parents.    Or have her spend about an hour on yahoo answers in this category..I am sure she will hear a lot pro and anti God.
6EapVDo8aa	I think that's an awesome gift idea, you could even corny with it and get the lucky bamboo that is shaped into different things, they might have some shaped into a heart.  I think that even if he does have those bowls filled up with plants that he will find a way to use the bamboo, even if he has to transplant something.  My bet is that he probably hasn't gotten any plants.  Vday is only a month and a half from Xmas, and he's a guy...most guys I know wait til the last minute to do anything.  I don't know your guy though.  But irregardless, sounds like a really thoughtful unique idea. Go for it.|`|fEgNxkE8aa	Yes! Really cool gift idea!  maybe you can have like the bamboo live in water with red coloring dye for a few days so it would suck it up and go red like celery. that would be cool and keep the theme!

Some people just don't see that life begins at conception.      The worst nightmare surrounding abortion is the 'partial birth abortion,' which should be stopped altogether, no matter what.  These are babies half delivered in breach position, and then by God, I can't bring myself to say what happens next... it is infanticide and torture, and unconscionable.      There should be no reason for a woman who does not want to keep her child to wait so late in her pregnancy to abort.  I am not for abortion at all, but if I can't stop it, I would at least hope that people in power would take measures to ensure that abortions were done as early as possible, before the innocent baby can FEEL being sucked apart.|`|E9chZY74aa	No.  He did exactly as I feared and why I didi not vote for him.|`|A01w1dHqaa	None of our Presidents have understood abortion. They are doing the bidding of those who put them in power and I'm not talking about the electorate though many of these agree with the power elite's take on abortion.      I have no fear of Obama reading my answer.    The reason for abortion being legal is so people will ask God what they should do instead of getting the answer from scripture or justifying actions because they are legal. The same is true of alcohol, drugs, prostitution, and gambling.|`|eTDteSnGaa	He voted that way because there was already laws on the books to protect the baby.  Did you not read the bill?|`|A9vvZ6eUaa	Really?  Did you realize abortion was legal before Obama took office and not one of you Pro-life presidents has been able touch it.  Obama is a democrat, you should of known he was pro-choice.    AND.....scripture should not be part of any presidents determination of governing this country.  This is a secular nation.  His religion does not belong in the Oval office.  Get that through your fundi head.|`|Eo7KcX3Waa	NO, he did not disappoint me with nothing that he has done so far, but has impressed me with the changes that he has made...  God never forced anyone to anything, why should the president of the United States be any different...God is not going to judge him for signing a bill, but God will judge those who will murder babies before they are born...the president is not doing nothing but allowing people to have a free choice, that is also what God is doing with us, so why should it be any different ?  Would you think that it would be better if God would all force us into salvation or give us a choice ?

I used to belong to this cult, but I broke free, and can now think and act for myself, and not according to it's dictators.|`|AA10098707	No, but not for lack of looking into the reasons why I believe, what I believe.  I don't think it is wise to believe anything blindly.  Especially not about critical matters involving life and death.  Find out why you believe what you believe, and don't be afraid of the truth.  I was willing to change my mindset if I found contrary evidence to my beliefs.  Just grateful I didn't have to.|`|AA10550142	Yes.  Before I was a Satanist I was a christian minister, then I studied zen buhddism.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	Sure...I changed my mindset on abortion for one thing.  I used to think "well, even if it was illegal, people would do it anyway and it wouldn't be safe, so you might as well let them do it legally".  Then I realized that if you used that logic, there are a lot of things that you'd have to make legal that shouldn't be legal.  Plus, if you believe that human life begins at conception, which I do, then killing a fetus is the same as killing a full grown person.  So I changed my mindset by realizing that my stance on abortion wasn't consistent with the other things I believe.    (I'm not looking to spark a hot button issue here...I'm just answering your question.)|`|6054317bb07ae62770b4e92462dbbf62aa	Yeah, I went from being a christian to being a occultist while still being a decieved christian to a christian who wants to recover.

Nowadays I've mellowed and am agnostic.      Part of the choice came in the realization that the universe is such a tremendously vast space, we may never know its secrets, including whether or not a God exists.      Therefore, we cannot arrogantly presume that one cannot exist, nor argue that one doesn't exist based upon our own desire to cling to that belief.  By the same token, we cannot assume that there is a God and live by the Bible, for example, which is a book tended and shepherded by human beings (even if it may originally have contained the written word of God).    Life is too short to be a hateful atheist.  It helps all around to keep an open mind, especially about things that you can't possibly get a definitive, concrete conclusion on.|`|04eaa3b707fecc377d89a52d2fb4afa9aa	Yes I have.    The biggest "mindset" change that has occurred in my life is my world-view.  In my past I pretty much accepted the views of the world and the promotion of self in order to succeed.  Today my "world-view" has changed dramatically.    This has occurred for 2 reasons.  The primary one is that I read the bible and am learning God's wisdom and perspective of the world around me.  I am gaining in understanding of how God's truths, that are written in the bible, can actually be applied in my daily life.  The second is that in my relationship with God and being open to His hand on and in my life He has broken the lies and deceptions or opened my eyes to some "truths or beliefs" that I had accepted to be true that are not.    Probably one of the biggest lies that has been broken in my life is that God truly loves me, fully and completely, as I am right now.  There is nothing I can do to make myself more acceptable or lovable in the eyes of God.  This is a truth claim from God that I did not accept or recieve in my own life.  This is because in my life performance was always the influence of my acceptance.  It took God several years to break this lie in my life.  As a result I have a HUGE shift in my understanding of what "the perfect love of God" really means.      The word love in all languages is one of the most abused words in the world.  Our beliefs, everyones, to one extent or another is relative to our understanding of what love is.  What it means to us and our perception of how we understand it, recieve it and express it to others.    You did not ask for an example, but I thought you might enjoy reading one.

I am guessing that that religion can't possibly have any allowance for Evolution in it either, as you are making a strong statement against it in your analogy. Instead of making Science Fiction Parables, why don't you just come right out and preach to us instead of hiding behind silly stories, as anyone with half a brain can see your point. Finally, I will hazard an answer, it is entirely impossible for the Robots to forget, as they have not reproduced over generations, and since they are machines of pure logic, they would know that they had been created, and none of their history would be lost through the miss-tellings of generations after generations of Robots.|`|271825b220e792c4ed4e69811e358f1eaa	It is not prideful to believe you are the result of natural causes, no more important than an ant.

If these subtle clues leave no trace or tangible evidence, wouldn't it be crazy to believe in them?

It only appears that way because they MIMIC human qualities, thereby giving them the appearance of thinking, or being, when it is their creator that they are taking clues of IMITATIONAL living.|`|AA10038311	Why should we be so arrogant and prideful as to say that they don't have the right to that decision when we only left subtle clues?...  And furthermore, why should we even deserve the slightest ammoubnt of respect from them for such a move?  Create a pocket universe and put robots in it because those robots don't have the right to be in the same existance as us?  Go through all of that effort when it would be inifinitely simpler to let robots exist on the same plane as us, while only leaving "subtle" clues.  Why not let them pass back and forth?  I'd say there'sa very good chance they'd have every right to full out loathe us, we'd get off lightly in being thought non-existance.    Do you assume robots should serve their human masters mindlessly and worship us?...  Even assuming it's more convenient to create a virtual secondary world for them (not a pocket dimension, just a simulated AI-world), if they wish to deny our existance, there's nothing wrong with that other than an indignant knee-jerk relaction, especially if it isn't proven.    Of course, humans inately have abilities of self-modification greater than those possessed by humans (at least pre-singularity).  As such, robots are capable of becoming better versions of themselves, and due to their more modular archetecture, could more easily become more intelligent, stronger, faster, more spiritual,and overall better than us.  What then?  Should they still worship something they have surpassed that was once their equivelant?

"you did what eeeooohhh!!!" he exclaimed. and he patiently explained to them that they had to go to a factory to get their babies built. one of the young robots was very shocked, "you mean that we are not a natural phenomenon, we're not the product of billions of years of evolution. the mechanic shook his head, 'fraid not, just look at the evidence, we can only exist if we are manufactured, we don't have transmittable DNA like all of the other critters, we are not obviously linked to the natural world. there is no fossil evidence of our descent, you don't dig toasters with legs out of coal mines. if we had evolved we would have numerous defects such as, our optical devices could possibly have the outputs to the vision processing centre back to front, or your energy processing system would have vestigial fossil components no longer used. these defects build up as evolving life forms can only work with what they've got in their DNA. we, on the other hand, can build you a perfect baby robot, the best design our artificial intelligences can come up with, you'll have to keep rebuilding it though, unless you want it to stay small and leave puddles of oil all over the place". "ah", said the male analogue robot, " i get it now, there is no logical progression from the natural world to us, we are unique and outside nature, and ,therefore logically, we must have been created". "you got it son", said the mechanic, "ain't that right bob", he said to the naked monkey sitting in the corner. "that's right doc", chirruped bob. and they all laughed. "it's damned cute how they do that, you could almost believe it understood us".|`|AA10154080	i see what your getting at but the problem with that is robots cant reproduce without being built so if there intelegent thayd know we exist so no we however are justifide in thinking that and if that were true we wouldnt care becaus its not our dimension and since we dont care it wouldnt matter|`|71b536a5c5110612322f206c6e2d5bb8aa	Justification is spell check.  You should use it.|`|AA10550142	Yes.  Completely justified.    You suggest that only "subtle clues" would be left behind by this race of creators.  That indicates to me that such "subtle clues" would be in opposition to "overwhelming factual evidence" on the other side of the arguement.  While, in the case of your robots, you have already told us that there is IN FACT a creator (or a group of them really) and the idea that there wasn't one would be a fallacy, it would still be a justifiable belief, there being only "subtle" and minor evidence to the contrary.  Remember that to justify an idea doesn't require absolute proof, it only requires that you establish the idea to be a reasonable possibility in the minds of others.  Jusification is in the eye of the jury.    If they did not believe in us, perhaps it was our own fault for leaving them insufficient evidence to support our own existance.  Perhaps we could have written a big sign on their moon saying "so long and good luck with your new planet" or something.    In the case of the robots, however, you began with the axiomatic assertation of an intelligent creator.  We humans aren't so lucky.  We don't have a concrete indication that the universe really was created by spirit beings, for our enjoyment, the only perceivable traces of which might just as well be naturally occuring phenomena from our point of veiw.  Where is the big sign on the moon that says "So long and good luck with Earth"?  We didn't get it.  I guess that means that if there IS a creator, he didn't want us to know about him.    Again, totally justified to be an atheist.  Even if it turns out to be untrue.|`|968ede165d358e16cebcdebea813e525aa	If we created a universe that appeared not to have been created, certainly. It all hinges on what you mean by "subtle clues". Do you mean "evidence" or something else?    Your question is pretty amusing but pointless, since you're asking "what if I'm right [in this robo-universe you concieved], would you be justified in believing I was wrong?". Well what if you're wrong then?

However Joseph didn't "know" her until after Christ was born.  It should be in the first few chapters of Matthew, Mark, & Luke (chapters 1-5 probably).  I don't know exactly how old she was but I get the impression that she was a teenager or perhaps just about 20 - the time that most Jewish women would marry during that time period.|`|945fa4833f6e002a74576a7891571c56aa	Yes - they were married.

Joseph was going to divorce her quietly when he found out that she had concieved, and not from him. Then an Angel of the Lord spoke to both of them in a dream, and told them not to fear, and that Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit. Joseph must have married her by the timet hat Jesus was born. Mary was probably around 15 years of age,    Hope this helps. You can go to the Bible and look in Luke to find the birth story and such. Good luck and God bless|`|a7fd823ff38cea82d01dbcb747972460aa	She was betrothed which was a binding agreement. This is why just up to the last century in America there was such a thing as breach of promise. I don't know if it is still around today or not. Maybe in some countries    Mary and Joseph never had relations. She was the New Arc of the Covenant. People who touched it in the Old Testament died. Joseph knew this. Just because today's world tells people they MUST have sex all the time doesn't mean that is what they though then. People could and did control themselves.

En el fondo, no hace ms que contemplar el bien como algo inalcanzable. Las cosas son valiosas cuando estn en manos de otro. El deseo de despojar, de que el otro no posea lo que tiene est en la raz del pecado de la envidia. Es un pecado profundamente insolidario que tambin tortura y maltrata al propio pecador. Podemos aventurar que el envidioso es ms desdichado que malo.    El envidioso siembra la idea ante quienes quieran escucharlo de que el otro no merece sus bienes. De esta actitud se desprenden la mentira, la traicin, la intriga y el oportunismo.  Si bien no es mi pensamiento original, siento que me representa. Solo agregara que es la frustracin y odio hacia uno mismo proyectado hacia otra persona.|`|c9yXevINaa	LA ENVIDIA ES EL PEOR SENTIMIENTO KE PUEDE EXISTIR SOBRE LA FAZ DE LA TIERRA , EXISTE POR GENTE KE NO KIERE LUCHAR POR CONSEGUIR SUS SUE?OS Y NO ACEPTA KE OTROS SI LO LOGREN!!!

La envidia bien manejada puede ser un motor para superarnos y pelear de manera constructiva por algo que deseamos y no tenemos, tiene mucho de admiracin, tiene mucho de observacin tambin, si en vez de detenernos en la sensacin agria de por qu el otro s y yo no nos ponemos a analizar qu hace el otro que no hago yo para llegar a donde est.|`|syvYOP5uaa	La envidia es un sentimiento feo y oscuro, eso de a?orar lo que el otro tiene sin siquiera hacer un esfuerzo por lograrlo o sin ver el esfuerzo del otro por llegar a sus metas.

Amar es ms que un sentimiento, amor es algo especial, amor es lo que siento, cuando a tu lado puedo estar  Si la belleza matara, t no tendrias perdn de dios  Las estrellas estan enojadas con Dios, porque no las hicieron tan hermosas como te hicieron a vos.  Cada vez que pienso en ti, mis ojos rompen en un llanto ... y muy triste me pregunto por que te quiero tanto.   No te digo mi vida, te digo mi amor, por que mi vida se termina, y mi amor por vos no   Esta ves pensaba que era un juego, pero ahora me doy cuenta que me enamor de t, amor mio.   Mi amor es tan grande que solo necesito tenerte en mi mente para saber que te amo.  El mayor obstaculo para el amor, es el temor secreto de no ser digno de ser amado.  Si quieres un amor pasajero, escucha tu cabeza, si quieres un amor verdadero escucha tu corazn.  ?Sabes que es lo ms bonito de mis ojos? El reflejo de los tuyos.  Cuando la noche tiende su manto y el firmamento se viste de azul; no hay lucero que brille como esos bellos ojos que tienes tu.  Te regalo un rayo de sol para iluminar tu vida. Las olas de mar para animar tu vida y una dulce oracin para amar cada dia mas a mi amor.  Hay instantes que merecen conservarse para siempre, y deseo compartir todos estos instantes contigo porque TQM  En la vida los tesoros no estan a simple vista, hay que buscarlos ... aprende de mi que un dia buscando tesoros te encontre a ti.  NUNCA digas NUNCA tampoco digas SIEMPRE pero dime que me quieres como NUNCA y para SIEMPRE  Este es el mensaje del amor:  Si lo borras me quieres,  si me respondes te gusto, si lo guardas me amas, si me lo devuelves me deseas ...  ?Qu piensas hacer?  Quien te viera como te veo yo  con tu sonrisa de luna,  con el brillo de las estrellas en tus ojos,  con petalos de rosa en tus labios rojos,  se habria enamorado como me enamore yo.  Si el ser pobre es mi mala suerte,  y el conocerte es mi suerte,  entonces voy a amarte,  hasta ms all de la misma muerte.   Te quiero y eres el centro de mi corazn.   Para m todas las mujeres son bellas, pero tu para mi eres una Diosa.  Si todos los Angeles son como tu, me moria ahora mismo.

FyLfEPv0aa	You will be saved.    That shows that you know Christs words and hear His voice.  You will find the same gospel in the Book of Mormon that you did the bible and just as the New Testament gives more light on Jesus Christ and expands our understanding of the Old Testament, the Book of Mormon will expand your understanding of the bible.    In this way its not taking away but building your faith and enriching your knowledge about that same Jesus and the same gospel He preached.    The bible does warn against false prophets, yet that very warning denotes what's clearly prophesied - that there will be prophets in our day and there must be for the purposes of God to go forth.    How sad it is that people are afraid of reading and studying and knowing for themselves.  The things they don't like about the Book of Mormon aren't normally things that are even in the Book of Mormon (most people focus on straw-man arguments citing things they object to that we LDS don't even believe).  So the warnings I've seen from people on here about the Book of Mormon for the most part are obviously from those who have never read it and have learned fear from someone else about it and motivation from fear is an awful thing.    Enjoy reading, those first 17 chapters of Nephi show a lot about faith.  I love the Isaiah chapters (it's an acquired taste but I love them) and the end of 2nd Nephi is inspiring.    I've read the Book of Mormon probably about 30 times, to this day I can't open it up and learn more from it.      There isn't a single page in it that doesn't help it's purpose be fulfilled "to convince Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the Living God."    You'll find the Christ you already know in it, you won't loose any good faith you have, but missing pieces in your faith will be filled in and you'll come closer to your God.    If only everyone had the open heart that you do we would live in a more beautiful world.          EDIT:  There is a comment below mine that reads "Remember, Jesus Himself warned us about false prophets. He said that there are no more prophets coming because He was the last one, He is the Son of God. Any one after Jesus that claims to be a prophet is a liar."  I'd be interested in knowing if anyone had a reference to that since I've read the bible dozens of times including the part in the revelation that talks of the latter-day prophets, Daniel, Issiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel who discuss them as well as the words of Paul and Peter that point to the restoration.      Nothing ever states that there would be no prophets after Christ, if it did the entire New Testament would be rendered false since all of it came after Christ.    My dear, read the bible and don't define your faith by what someone tells you.  You're responding to someone in the process of reading something first-hand to know what's in it; your response of quoting a scripture that not only doesn't exist but runs contrary to the prophecies of the bible will only reinforce the commitment of the one asking the question to study and read.    You can't fight someone seeking knowledge with hear-say which is not only false, but would render your church without basis for any claim to truth as it purports to be the only church with a literal continuation of apostolic keys meaning that the Catholic church has claimed for 2 millennium the gift of prophecy.      So whoever told you that is someone that isn't versed in your own church history nor the bible.|`|AA10192697	Because the Book of Mormons was written by Mr. Smith, not God.  The Holy Bible is the inspired word of God, written by hand picked men that God sent His Holy Spirit to to write down what God wants us to know.  The Book of Mormons isn't God's word.    The Original Sin is the sin of disobedience that Adam & Eve committed. It was the first sin made by mankind, thus called the 'original sin'.    Yes, Jesus died and rose for us, in order for us to be able to repent and receive forgiveness.  But His death didn't stop us from sinning nor did it erase all sins. He opened the gates to Heaven and gave us personal access to His Father so we can ask for forgiveness. So we are still able to sin and we still have to believe and repent in order to receive His forgiveness.      There aren't little differences between Mormons and Catholicism, there are huge differences.  That's why a Catholic (like myself) would tell you that you are following a false prophet.  Remember, Jesus Himself warned us about false prophets. He said that there are no more prophets coming because He was the last one, He is the Son of God. Any one after Jesus that claims to be a prophet is a liar.  Hence, Joseph Smith, Muhammed, Mr. Jones, etc.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	I have often pondered the basis for Christians averrations that Mormons, Catholics, worshippers at the church across the street from their own, JWs, etc, will not be saved.    Most Christians, when asked, what pre-requirements are there for a person to be saved, will answer after this fashion:    "If anyone - whosoever - accepts Jesus Christ as their Saviour, then they are assured of salvation"      Catholics accept Jesus as Saviour, so are they saved?  The answer then becomes more complex as the 'decider' adds reasons why, despite their obvious faith in Jesus Christ, Catholics are condemned to Hell, and also finds or invents reasons to bar Mormons, JWs, and lots of others besides, that, according to their rendition of the Bible, fail to meet 'their personal criteria' for salvation.    In such circumstances are we to believe that Jesus' statement that "Whosoever believeth in me shall not perish but have life everlasting" is one of Jesus' stock 'switch and bait' tactics, and that Jesus actually lied when he said that, in order to hook the gullible into joining his cult?    According to what Jesus said, the only necessary thing was to believe that he - Jesus - is the mashich, the Son of God, and the believer will be saved.    Who, then, can call Jesus a liar and cobble together a list of believers in Jesus Christ and so fulfil Christ's condition for salvation, but are barred from the blessings that Jesus freely offers to believers because of some 'hedges' that certain believers have erected in order to claim salvation as their personal elitist and exclusive right, and nothing but Hell for the rest?    The basic questions to be answered are,     1 - "Was Jesus lying?"      2 - "If Jesus was lying - what then?"    3 - "If Jesus wasn't lying is everyone else (those who contradict and deny His veracity and the truthfulness of His 'whosoever' offer) lying?    4 - "If all who do not believe that the words of Jesus saying: "Whosoever believeth in me shall not perish but have everlasting life" were not spoken truthfully, but deceptively, how then can anyone trust anything that Jesus has said?

Not someone else who has differing beliefs.   I do not understand how others feel they have the right and authority to condemn others who do not share their beliefs.That is left up to God.  Personally, I feel that Christ is my judge (as the Bible teaches) and he will be the one to decide my fate.      That I belief in him, He knows.  How he will judge me, I will leave up to him. In the mean time, I will continue to worship him how I am taught within the doctrines of the Church of Jesus Christ (of Latter-day Saints).    One last point for you to consider. Every Christian denomination out there has varying beliefs. That is why there ARE so many different denominations.

There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|DRSv6SOLaa	"Mormonism" teaches a false gospel and a false christ, Period!  (It is a Cult!)  |`|25qUTYLEaa	Because The Holy Bible cannot be taken away from or added to. It warns about false teachers and false prophets and that different doctrines should not be added to God's word!
UcKVCjLSaa	I agree with you and believe you. I understand what you (well, God) said. Many people are led astray by churches (of all places) because they are not teaching what God truly wants. They input all kinds of man made laws, pick and choose which laws to keep, change some laws according to the tastes of themselves and parishioners. They twist God so much, that he in fact begins to look as if He contradicts himself.   However, just because someone else is doing that, does that mean you have to? NO, and I don't and neither should you.  I read the bible myself (and so should you if you really want to know what God says and him alone) Whoever thinks that priests or pastors are the only ones who can do this are sadly mistaken (as it is usually this group prone to folly)   Its not like in those old days where only certain people could read and write. Everybody can now and should be helping to follow and execute God's decrees as He had written fit.   You can indeed do your job, by helping to pick up the trash. Learn for yourself what to do and present that to others. God is very logical so you can make sense of it and help others to make sense of it. Challenge people to think about their ways and how they are. Help them to see the truth and be a light for people. You can do this by just helping people when an opportunity opens to present God to someone else. (You don't have to go searching for them, they will come across your path everyday) and here is a passage for you: Matt 5:13-16|`|E9chZY74aa	God speaks only through the Bible.  No further revelation is needed.  Glad you were a good citizen and cleaned up.|`|ec0b60fee25a982ef565651fd4f465d1aa	Very interesting.    I left a church that was not preaching God's word. I found a non denom. church that did.    Sad sad sad there are so many searching. I went to a church for years that didn't ever once ask me or preach salvation. If I had died I would have not gone to heaven.    ?|`|dDMOJWxwaa	As far as the people in the church:    Matt 9:12   12 But when Jesus heard [that], he said unto them, They that be whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.    Did you happen to notice a sign over the church doors like: Restricted, perfect people only.    You go to church a set a righteous example in and OUT of church.  You live as you know you should and keep the commandments.  You serve others, becoming an angel to those who cannot help back. You click up your life, less reading and TV and a bit more scripture and prayer.    That is what you do.|`|vwwUhx3faa	all matter in the entire universe is The Church, including litter and 'ugly' people etc.     the 'trash' god speaks of is your idea that there is anything other than god anywhere. it is concepts made by people, mental constructions, that are then overlayed on the world and it's inhabitants, and taken for reality.     remove the false ideas - the trash - and the church will be seen everywhere, as everyone, as everything.     IN NO THING DOES GOD NOT DWELL.     or you could put it as:    this is a costume party, where the host is the only guest. god is disguised as the universe. nice costume god. haha|`|ce26AOVzaa	I see the church for the trash, and it is not a easy task to clean it up.|`|VHwM54iUaa	A lot of people in the church are not working out their salvation.     "Therefore, my dear friends, as you have always obeyednot only in my presence, but now much more in my absencecontinue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you to will and to act according to his good purpose."  Philippians 2:12-13    That work is continually repenting of our sin and dying to the flesh.  When people don't work on this they can accumilate quite a pile of sin or "trash".  And as the time for Christ's return gets closer, it seems like this trash is piling up at a multiplied rate.  Compromise, unforgiveness, selfishness, and pride manage to prevent disposal of the trash and many churches are stinking pretty bad.  Bad enough that people are starting to avoid them.|`|208557bb6eec298af05daee61976e842aa	Yeah well  seems appropriate to me.  They should use the church itself as a trash bin.  (Especially the Baptist or the Jehovah Witness church.)  .|`|k4WlqPK7aa	if you hear voices you should seek therapy.|`|t88527U1aa	Every Church is full of sick people,Spiritually sick!,The Church is a hospital that attempts to restore them to health through the love of Jesus Christ! They are not garbage God will see to eat it is cleaned up in the end,trust in him!
AA10691201	I'd just be like, "you have your truth, I have mine. We both think we're right so let's not talk about it."|`|YUZKgeLtaa	hypocrisy is present in  the bible and Jesus also condemns it  several times. Look in the Zondervan NIV study bible and look up hypocrisy in the concordance. It will take you to every verse that the bible mentions it. It is very difficult for people to get it right and we all fall short. Some fall shorter than others. This is noticed and has condemned many as hypocrites. Take people on a diet for example. It is not easy to discipline ourselves to perfection. It is not fully obtainable when sin is so much part of our nature. That is why we need Jesus. Scripture says " Anyone who claims he is without sin, lies and deceives himself". It is hard to find the perfect person because they do not exist. Do not lump us as a group there are black sheep in almost every family.|`|38f15601baa14cb41ff2021454524fbbaa	I've had just as much atheistic hypocrisy as the Christian version of same.The same atheists who claim to be tolerant and understanding have no compunctions about saying vile things about Christ and insulting His followers.     They object to "loaded questions," then contrive bizarre little mental games designed to make Christians look bad, no matter how we answer them. They claim to be the morally upright, and yet they hurt their fellow human beings with complete disregard for their feelings.    So I suppose I could ask you the same question. If an atheist taunts you and blasphemes the Savior that you love above all things, what piece of advice would you give?|`|d45a15ef47ccb3ed90fbff1fb9b09ef6aa	I would first wonder why you call them friends and then attack them behind their backs in a public forum.  My advice to them is to find a better friend.    If you don't like it, then don't hang out with them. If you don't want to go to church, then don't go.    I haven't met many christians in person who condemn me. Most of them are "concerned" for my eternal welfare.  On here, there are plenty who hide behind the mask of the internet and who feel free to tell me how Jesus is firing up the coals of hell just for me, but that's simply because they get frustrated with my disagreement of their belief.    I don't take "condemnation" personally.. I'm secure in what I believe, and I certainly am secure with my friendships. I would never backstab my friends this way. I'd take my concerns to them instead.|`|68c1d5b1f14b95ec630477c10b85baefaa	My advice to you is to stop going to the church where thes kids are being fed a twisted version of what Christ taught. Yes they are hippocrits! They have not had the guts or intelligence to actually read the biblical texts using available reference material that would show them what was actually meant! They rely soley on the mis-interpretations spouted by the preachers, priests, and gurus.    If you do read the bible, ensure you have a lexico available so that you can look up the original words and the true interpretation of those words. And remember, every word of the "Old Testament" was only meant for the jews, not the gentiles. It is in the New Testament and mostly in the teachings of Paul that you will find the true Christian way.|`|7300b67211d400f8dc6e96e473093503aa	You all sound like you need a tune up with Jesus to me. Your Christians friends are not living a good example of Christ-like living. And you sound very judgemental you expect them to be perfect and yet you are not perfect. I would just tell them to practise what they preach. I feel bad that you don't have a better example to follow. Many Churches today are not boring, they play very upbeat music and have some great programs for young people. I hope you have the ability to see that Jesus was the only perfect one we all fail terribly and that is why He died for us all, including you. Not all Christian kids are rascals.|`|AA10002921	Send them to the Word of God. If it rebukes or convicts them, they are true believers. If they excuse their actions, they are impostors posing as Christians. Call them on the carpet.    Matthew 15:18  But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, and they defile a man.    James 3:9-11  With it we bless our God and Father, and with it we curse men, who have been made in the similitude of God. Out of the same mouth proceed blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not to be so. Does a spring send forth fresh water and bitter from the same opening?|`|2ggCBwbhaa	wow, i hate people like that. i am a christian and i go to church all the time. i don't drink smoke or do drugs but every once and a while i can't help my self and cuss. but im trying to stop and i will soon!|`|KhXWyfQDaa	Christian Hypocrisy really ought to be a single word.    I haven't had your experience, but I do know that I and pretty much everyone alive have experienced the joys of Christian Hypocrisy in one form or another.|`|DDqgVQ49aa	"And why do you look at the speck in your brothers eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, Let me remove the speck from your eye; and look, a plank is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brothers eye."    From the Sermon on the Mount, if I'm not mistaken. Starting at Matthew 7:3, to be precise.|`|AA11376441	When I see any fundamentalist person trying to spew his/her self righteousness over me. I enter into smile & ignore mode.|`|ba2d632a3ae826f6a7d5385da46ed5efaa	There's a difference between saying that you're a Christian and actually being a Christian. I believe that only God can tell if people are truly Christians or not, but a lot of people you kind of have to wonder about. I went to a Christian school for about 10 years so I know so many hypocrites who were "Christians" during school and then when they finally got to public school did other things that they would never have done in Christian school. On the other hand, even though I am I Christian, I still sin. But I believe that Jesus forgives me for those sins when I ask him too.   I'm trying to just give you my opinion and I really hope I'm not preaching to you because I hate it when people insult my beliefs and so I feel like giving people the respect that I often wish I could get. You probably started reading and was like "Oh just another Christian hypocrite." So try to understand my view point. You don't have to agree with it.   I agree though. A lot of Christians are hypocrites, but that doesn't mean that all of them are. If you were to come to my church I would actually be excited you were there, but I would never say "why-are-you-here-you-devil-wor..." And I'm sorry you've felt like that.      So I hope that helped a little :)|`|OAjN34M4aa	My how I love it when the same people who condemn others for being Christians in the first place, and believing in "nonsense", then turn around and accuse them of not being Christian enough. I've been known to drop the "f-bomb" myself, as you so colorfully put it, and while I don't drink, I don't condemn those who do. You remind me of a woman I once knew who said a girl couldn't "really" be a Christian because she was wearing a toe ring and sandals. Consider your own hypocrisy, or to use a purely Christian saying, get the beam out of your own eye before you go digging for the mote in mine.|`|yalmgWROaa	I am a believer, and I do believe you raise a compelling issue. First of all, do they continually behave this way? If they do, your point, in terms of their ungodly actions, is justified. Drop them like a bad habit. If you're not a devil worshipper, and it's true that they call you one, falsely, smile, take your shoes off, and shake the dust off their bottoms as a testimony against them. Then leave and never go back. As for "Christians" like these dorks giving you advice about ANYTHING, just tell them you know the difference between bad advice and stupid advice so, gee,- you guess you don't need  their advice. Hypocrisy like that is nothing more than shame wearing a halo.

Extremes of wealth or hardship can test our priorities. Paul spoke of spiritual resources that enabled him to be content regardless of material circumstances: For all things I have the strength by virtue of [God] who imparts power to me. (Philippians 4:13) Rather than looking to his possessions, many or few, or to his circumstances, good or bad, Paul looked to God to satisfy his needs. The result was contentment.    Jesus was faced with many difficult situations. He had to handle personality conflicts among his followers, as well as endure the hatred and mockery of his enemies. He also had to resist the temptations of this world.    In Jesus case, keeping in mind the joy that was set before him, the high rewards awaiting him, helped him to keep walking in the truth. This joy that was set before him outweighed by far the temporary discouragements or distractions that he had to face.    Why did Paul not get discouraged to the point of giving up? He explains: For all things I have the strength by virtue of him who imparts power to me. (Philippians 4:13) He did not try to carry his burdens alone.

Peter could say this because he had recieved God's disapproval,read at   Galatians 2:11-14 However when Cephas(Peter)  came to Antioch I resisted him face to face   (Paul) because he stood condemned.For before the arrival of certain men from James he used to eat with the people of the nations but when they arrived he went withdrawing himself and separating himself in fear of those of the circumsised class.    This was when the good news about the Christ had just been opened up to the Gentile nations.  1. Jesus was not white nor his desciples they were Jews.  2.Job 1:3 Job was an oriental from Uz probably black.  3.Miriam began to speak against Moses because he had married a Cushite woman (black) and was stricken with leprosy.Numbers 12:1  4.The Shulammite girl  was certainly approved of by God but she said:"A black girl I am but comely."The Song of Solomon1:5      Proverbs 2:1-9 Exodus 6:3 Isaiah 12:2|`|WUjlEuTtaa	A Christian is still a human being..Racism isn't exclusive to Christianity..For them it could be the sin they struggle with..|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Love thy neighbor, as long as he believes in your exact form of imaginary fairy.

Now quit that :-)    Many Christians justify their racism by drawing unwarranted conclusions about the origins of race--inventing, for example, that the mark of Cain was dark skin and so his descendants are inferior because they're paying for the murder he committed.  Or how God directed the Israelites to commit genocide on the Canaanites.    They conveniently ignore other parts of the Bible, such as Moses' second wife--an Ethiopian (and yes, they were quite dark back then).  When other Israelites criticised that marriage, God struck them down with leprosy until they repented.  Do you like that one?    Bible also justifies slavery.  There is no consistent single message to be found in the Bible.|`|vHcaWpV5aa	The bible instructs you to be racist! It says people of different tribes shouldn't mix etc...

AA10098707	Oh, I love C.S. Lewis!  I have read Mere Christianity a few times, as well as The great divorce, but it has been some time now.  The Screwtape letters are another great one, and give a great perspective on what is very likely going on all around us.  In Mere Christianity, if you try to underline your favorite quotes, I found I need to just give up, because so much of it is amazing.  He is just an amazing thinker, and writer.  There is so much more to him than just the Chronicles of Narnia.  I hope more people read him.  Would love to see that book made into a movie somehow, it would be interesting for sure.|`|90b96411e787348fedfd9dbaaf9c538daa	I read Mere Christianity. I would summarize the book's main thesis as follows:    According to C.S. Lewis Jesus was either what he claimed to be or he was crazy. Lewis reasons that Jesus was not crazy because crazy people don't do miracles or resurrect from the dead. Thus, Lewis concludes, Jesus could only have been the divine son of God and savior of us all.    The logic seemed simplistic to me. The book assumes that the mainstream Christian interpretation of the New Testament is correct. It assumes that the miracles described in the New Testament were real. It assumes that Jesus claimed to be God --and I can't find anything in the NT where Jesus claimed to be God.    I also read the Screwtape Letters which is a mildly entertaining fantasy about demons. And I started to read The Chronicles of Narnia but gave it up because it didn't hold my interest.    No disrespect to C.S. Lewis but I'm not a big fan.|`|1d32a97defe549a9acbcdda54e001abeaa	1). yes.  2). no.      :P|`|AA10550142	I haven't read the Great Divorce, but I'm a big fan of The Screwtape Letters.  C.S.

AA12165299	i always find it amusing when atheists and their subjective morality finds Christianity objectionable on a moral level...the hypocrisy is amazing...and those atheists don't see their illogical stance...    how can you judge Christianity to be wrong on a moral level when your morals are subjective...why are your subjective morals right and my morals based on the Bible wrong...|`|v7Wflu78aa	I really liked "God is Not Great."  I don't care for Christopher Hitchens personally - I like the message, not the messenger.    I was intrigued by one person who, if I can paraphrase and clean up what he said, reminded Hitchens that if one does a body-count of results due to religiously inspired violence versus, then one has to do a body-count of deaths due to atheist-inspired violence.    Actually, now that I have written it out, that critic of Hitchens didn't make much sense, did he.    I now totally agree that tolerating religion is like tolerating racism in terms of the effect on society.    My own opinion is that fundamentalist versions of religion is grossly harmful.  Fundamentalists have no choice but to curb their intelligence and sensitivity in order to believe that there is one source, and one cure, for everything.  This literally cripples the brain - it becomes unable to sense and analyze reality, and makes fundamentalists poor decision makers and poor parents.|`|96e31ceb1fe7561cc98bdbb17b080483aa	The title alone tells me it is a book of misconception.

AA11047076	Judaism is not for you.  It has NVER been henotheostic- when it refers to other heavenly powers the reason those cannto be worshipped is because they are all universally seen as not having free wil and merely being tools of Hashem- they ar enot G-ds, merely servants like angels that have no free will and carry out a job.  this has always been the position in Judaism and it has never changed.    You also some have heavy misconceptions about Judaism- men are NOT above women- the opposite is actually true- women are spiritually SUPERIOR to men, that is why they have fewer rules since men need the extra rules to raise their spirituality to the level of the women!    Issues as to why Judaism is not for you:  Polytheism/henotheism is completely forbidden.  The Torah explictly states "Hear O Yisrael, G-d- is your -od, G-d is ONE!"  Homosexuality:  While homosexuality is not forbidden, homosexual sex is.  Thuis is a non-negotiable issue in Orthodox Judaism since their is an explicit commandment in the Torah against it!  witchcraft"  Once again the Torah explicitly forbids this.    Animal and plant sacrifice:  not done today- but when Mashaich comes it will restart- it is explictly commanded that we do this by G-d!  Shabbos- once again. not working on Shabbos is explicit in the Torah.  Honouring your parents- once again an explicit commandment!    Now if you have problems with those elements of Judaism- you are explicitly rejecting Judaism.  The bottom line- Judaism is not for ou.  Go and find a Pagan or neo-Pagan path you are comfortable with, it is clear that you will never be comfortable with Judaism, and t is highly unlikely that any Rabbi would ever convert you with that list of issues!|`|aO4iCwtoaa	It sounds like Judaism is not for you.      Judaism is a religion based on laws, and accepting those laws is required for conversion.  I'm not sure what it is about Judaism that you believe is drawing you to it, because some of the laws you have issues with (particularly the belief in only one god and rejection of multiple deities) - are the central beliefs of the Jewish religion.  I don't know why you chose to take on so many Jewish practices without believing in the core beliefs of Judaism, but any rabbi (not to mention any pastor) will tell you that as a non-Jew you are not obligated to do them.  Even a Noachide does not believe in plytheism, so I don't see that being the answer, though it's probably a better fit for you.    Keep on searching for what you're looking for - and don't be afraid to take your own path.  It's good that you care so deeply about wanting to find a faith that works for you.  But based on your description, I don't think Judaism will make you happy or make you feel fulfilled - and I don't think you would be accepted into any conversion program so long as you can't let go of your doubts.    Have you explored Hinduism and Sikhism?  They each share some of the things you say you value in Judaism, and do not disallow some of the practices you say you do believe in.
AA12384132	Not only is it in the Bible, But if you know how to correspond certain letter to numbers. 666 will spell out Satan.,as well as evil............ The sad thing about this world is that people just don't believe that pure evil exist in this world.... And believe's that people have the choice's to preform either. And in many, many cases that belief is very far from the truth. Satan is a very real enity and so is his fallen angel's. And one day in the near future this world population will wake up to that fact, But then for billions of people it will be to late for them to do anything about it..................|`|AA11155909	Bible says the mark of the beast is 666.|`|cc1ba6b0728cacb0aa2b8c20c0cb48f6aa	"Here is wisdom.

I have no clue why though other than the Bible says it.|`|fc699ce4663c0eeb3db0d8ed25ae2a81aa	The only place that the number "666" is mentioned in the Bible is in the book of "Revelation".    You can find it in the 13th Chapter, in verse 18.    This is where the number 666 originally got related to the devil.|`|12d99e1ff8a38fe71cc5bdd41198fd16aa	from what one historian said Nero Cesar's name numerically added up to 666. this was the person referred to since Nero burned Rome and blamed the catastrophe on the Christians.|`|6cc20c52cc4407e799b89962d5e63437aa	Its in the bible|`|f47d12bd94a3fd5bf299d1351b6b57bfaa	In the book of Revelation in The Bible, the mark of the Beast will be 666.|`|c3fcdf6bd0f58ae1c19bc74a2947853caa	in  the bible says its the number of the beast|`|a59de3edacd6202132e97c8859514223aa	This is what i remember:  The devil ruled over some people or something.

That mark was 666|`|8451c42275fd7b898691e135249d3adeaa	Revelation, Chapter 13 speaks of the beast and how to identify his followers. According to verses 16 and 17, they will have the mark or the name or number of the beast on their right hands or foreheads. Verse 18 introduces the number 666 itself: "Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six."     It's unclear why the specific number 666 is the number of the beast. According to Dial-the-Truth Ministries, the number 6 is the number of man because in the Bible, God created man on the sixth day. Elsewhere in the Bible (Matthew 16:23), Satan is described as being "man-centered" (as opposed to God-centered). Thus the devil's number would be a twist on man's number. This is just one theory, and the number 666 has generated plenty of debate.|`|efd2275e6ac804f4e7da305b3db6a58faa	dear these are all supertitious things..........u r living in a technology era and we believe in reasons not the facts.........so there is no relationship|`|11c6d4a821d714723f34b9b412cad347aa	It's the mark of the beast it's in the bible, you should read it sometime, trying reading revelation|`|b3619d42ae8bd30f7f3e32139d63e51daa	it was from a passage in the BIble that said (paraphrasing) that the mark of the beast was 666.|`|AA10047634	It's the number of the Antichrist.

Body language tells you things about people, that maybe they can't express or don't know how to express. And language is a way of passing information, which body language does.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Communication IS a language. Body language is being able to communicate you feelings as opposed to your thoughts. It is easy for someone to be able to read when another person is happy or upset. It is the basic form of language, stemming from when you are a baby and can not translate your feelings. It is universal and most certainly a language.

So to find the one tru religion that Christ started, then you have to look at all the requirements he put down in the scriptures. When you find the religion that is actually putting into WORK all those requirements, then you have found the true one.    Start by looking at the Lord's Prayer in Matthew Ch 6 starting in Verse9. First thing it says to do is ...9?YOU must pray, then, this way:    Our Father in the heavens, let your name be sanctified"    Who is sanctifying God's name? Most people call him by his Titles as Father or Lord or God and others. Who is really sanctifying his NAME? Jehovah????    Start there and keep searching...

Without a cause, we will not think and take action in a certain way, so I think that that our choices (to an extent) are determined this way...

Again, I'm just playing devil's advocate here. I myself am not quite sure that I even believe in God, much less in determinism.|`|AA12045591	What causes sponteneity? What causes you to try something new? What makes one option more appealing one moment and less appealing the next? In one moment there are many external influencers and internal influencers that determine how well you will recieve a message and how much importance you put on it. Your past experiences also affect how we respond to the stimuli around you. To say that we have free will or that we are slaves to our surroundings can only be determined by answering what free will is? Is free will having a choice that is only decided by a logical, concious mind that is free from external/internal influencers? Or is it our experience with our surroundings that make us wise? To feel hunger helps us understand poverty. To feel loneliness helps us value friendship. To feel loss and grief helps us to empathize with and console others. The experience of puberty changes the way a boy sees a girl and viceversa. So, if past experiences influence how we percieve our surroundings, and we are constantly influenced by what is going on around us and inside us, then how much of a choice does our "will" have? Sponteneity doesn't prove free will. It proves that no matter how logical, sane, and wise we try to be, we will always be influenced by the chaos that surrounds us.

Here:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaVeyan_Sat...    Satanists do not believe that Satan is a god; rather the function of God is performed and satisfied by the Satanist him/herself. That is, the needs of worship, ritual, and religious/spiritual focus are directed, effectively, inwards towards the Satanist, as opposed to outwards, towards God.    LaVey proposes instead that as all gods are creations of man, worship of an external deity is worship of its creator by proxy. He suggests, then, that the rational Satanist should instead internalize his god, and therefore worship himself; hence the Satanic maxim, "I am my own god."    It follows that Satanism shuns the idea of belief in all other deities as well, including, to the surprise of many, Satan. Satan is viewed as a literary archetype, along the lines of John Milton's epic hero. This archetype is viewed not as a negative figure, but as a positive image of pride and mastery in opposition to servitude, faith, and humility.    Belief in any such externalized deities is generally considered grounds for excluding someone as a Satanist, and devil worship in particular is considered nothing more than a misguided inversion of Christianity.|`|5a09d3522ae00b907170eed9a6d5ec69aa	most "modern" Satanist do not worship Satan.

LaVeyan Satanists do not recognize Satan as a deity, but rather as a symbol to focus their lives around and aspire to.  They respect everything that the Biblical Satan represents, and chose to model their own lives after him.  However, they are atheists and believe that Self is the higher authority.  The basis of LaVeyan Satanism are described in greater detail in "The Satanic Bible" and the other writings of Anton LaVey.  You can also look at the Church of Satan's official website: http://www.churchofsatan.com .  The rituals that are described in LaVey's books are psychological and not intended to manipulate the universe, they are to be used as a tool to break away from the religious indoctrination that many of us are subjected to from a young age, whether it is from our families or society in general.    Theistic Satanists, Traditional Satanists, Luciferians, and Diabolators all acknowledge Satan as an active, living entity.  He is the Bestower of Knowledge and the Father of Wisdom, based on his gift of free will to mankind in the Garden of Eden (as described in the book of Genesis).  He is not the "Lord of all Evil" but the God of this World, representing carnality, intellectual power, human progress, indulgence, and individuality.  Satanists do not "worship" Satan in the traditional sense of the term, but honor and respect him, and see themselves as being Satan's kindred and friends, not his "followers or servants".  Theistic Satanists (or any of the above synonyms) are considered Pagans by many, as some choose to relate to Satan in the form of a more ancient God: Set from Egyptian mythology, or Hades/Pluto from the Greek/Roman pantheon.  Diabolators can mix and match different viewpoints of the Devil according to their own individual experiences with him both inside and outside of ritual, but NO true Diabolator worships or even remotely acknowledges a being of Pure Evil.  Some even view Satan as a formless force of nature, always present and always active.  Some Theistic Satanists acknowledge the existence of Yahweh, but views on him vary also.  Some view him as an opposing force of Satan, required to maintain harmony ... others view him as a tyrant who will be overthrown.  All things are based on the Satanist's individual experience.  You can check out http://www.theisticsatanism.com for more information.    Then of course, there are Satanists which could more appropriately be referred to as "Reverse Christians".  They view Satan as the Lord of all Evil and themselves as the enemies of good and the servants of darkness.  They are usually the ones who like to do things for shock value, like faking animal sacrifice or desecrating church parking lots.  (Note to everyone:  Any true LaVeyan or Theistic Satanists would never be involved in any of those things!)    This is a very brief overview, but I hope that it helps you understand Satanism a little better.  If you have any more questions, you can feel free to email me (the link is activated on my profile).  Have a great day!    ~A.S.~|`|2f124b7a5c1ab950206072bf46bd1f6daa	Satan is nothing but the representation of mans nature/ human nature.  It is the Christians that actually NEED a figure like Satan to exist not Satanism.    WHY?    Simple logic.  Without Satan in the Christian religion there original sin story wouldn't have happened.  There would be no need for this God to kill his child so he could forgive people.  (Yea I admit this one is stupid reguardless of weither Satan exists or not)  However without a Satan there is no enemy for them to hate.  Without someone to hate Christianity would fall on its face!    Satanists do not need Satan because none of the philosophy is based or dependant upon the existence of a Satan.|`|AA10550142	I am a Satanist.    I have never met a "devil worshipper".    Satan is perhaps a concept, perhaps an archetype, perhaps a term for nature itself- but the one thing Satan is NOT-  the wayward angelic son of the God of Abraham.  There is no YHWH.  God is imaginary.    Most of the above referenced information on Satanism is accurate, particularly Marissa's fine answer.    There are some "theistic satanists" out there, but they are few and far between.  Virtually everyone who identifies themselves as a "Satanist" is also an atheist.

To ask if someone is "still" turned on by a girl implies that there was once a time when they were turned on by girls.  As a gay guy, I can truthfully say that I have NEVER been turned on by the opposite sex, and so asking if I "still" get turned on by one indicates a flaw in awareness and in thinking.    There was a time when I pretended to be turned on by girls, but that was in a different age.  It was still possible for me to wind up like Matthew Shepherd if I let on in any way that I was gay...but I've met other gay guys, including my boyfriend, and so the need to pretend is no longer there, and since I don't live in a country in which homosexuality is illegal, there is no need to pretend.  Now, if I stay in the USA, and the religious right gets its way...well...rather than begin pretending again, I'll just move to another country.|`|aa61ff3d10a2b2f424ae78fc72415eeeaa	No honey.|`|AA10530337	I don't think gay men are turned on by women or else they would not be gay.

Xjekjqmqaa	Thats a lovely name i must say, but, i don't know to be honest.    I think it is from Sura 66. At-Tahrim    The Surah derived its name from the words lima tuharrimu of the very first verse. This too is not a title of its subject matter, but the name implies that it is the Surah in which the incident of tahrim (prohibition, forbiddance) has been mentioned.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	it sounds like "Tahreen" which i think means "pure"  but idk    it is a lovely name      :)      Allah(swt) knows best|`|qky7gWosaa	Salaam.

ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	How much are you looking to spend?  If you're looking for inexpensive gifts under $50.00, you could get him some CDs from some of his favorite bands and/or some inexpensive video games from GameStop.com and/or some good Belgian ale (or possibly some other English/Irish/German beer that he likes).  If you can spend more than that, say $100.00 to $150.00, a good pair of hiking boots would be a good buy, or maybe one of two of the newer and more expensive video games.  If you REALLY want to spoil him and have the money to do it, he'll probably love you forever if you got him an X-Box 360 (nothing against PS3 or Wii, but the X-Box 360 is cheaper and more readily available than the PS3 and it has more games -- both on-line and on CD -- than PS3 and Wii combined).|`|AA10550142	Video games and Hiking...

The super bowl should be about the game and not an opportunity for every opinionated party, organization, cause (whatever) to come out of the woodwork and spread their agenda. A PETA ad encouraging viewers to become vegetarians was also banned from the super bowl. I can't say I'm too disappointed about this either.    I'm glad that NBC has stopped trying to indoctrinate us during the super bowl and chosen to let the game just run its course.
Ur53Pf6zaa	Hmmm. Interesting.  Yes, it is supposed to feel like prison.  And, you're only supposed to be 'here' temporarily so, you actually don't belong here.  We are enslaved on this earth to fleshly, worldly desires such as sex, food, material things, status, money, etc.  If you feel this is prison (enslavement) you are actually quite enlightened.   Don't think of any fool thing like leaving this earth before its time.  You are supposed to be here so when our life with Christ comes ... the comparison between freedom and prison brings you such joy that it lasts for an eternity.   The taste of sweet food wouldn't be so sweet without the comparison to salt.  Warm sunny days wouldn't be as good without the comparison to winter.  Good wouldn't be as good without the comparison to evil.       Focus then on the spiritual life that Christ promised you could have now, in this life.  Your 'heaven' can begin now, so you are actually very lucky.  Give thanks for that and start a new life now.   Your example could help the rest of us who cant put down the pizza, porn and pot.|`|wwdllMzYaa	yes i totally understand what you mean    i often have felt that this body is holding me back from many signiciant things, things that 'spiritually' im supposed to be doing    it does feel liek a prison sometimes  why because you know you feel soemthign is missing, soemthing in you, you feel you want and NEED soemthing else that you are not getting in this life, in this body,     i always say i have felt i was pagan long before i even knew what pagan was,  partly because i have always known i have soemthing to do in this life, but my body stops me|`|02sr7hNOaa	No, loosen your clothes and go for a walk, also try eating less pizza!|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	Only if you are lost and following satan, instead of following God through His son Jesus free gift of salvation.|`|vHcaWpV5aa	Sometimes I also wish I would be picked up by aliens and taken to a planet without relgion and the biggotry that comes with it :)|`|MMImKRAgaa	no, but an shelter for my being or spirit, through which I see and hear have touch, and do omniscience to God (show gratitude).|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Making right choices gives you more freedom to make choices. Making bad choices shackles you by the consequences of those choices. If you feel you are trapped in a prison, it is likely of your own making.    Knowledge helps you make the right choices. It is really all up to you (and your attitude about things).|`|CfWXgwxBaa	YES,YES,YES AND A TRILLION TIMES YESSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

But it's not what God has purposed..  So he gives us understanding to know why life is the way it is...  What is the purpose of life...and what hope there is for the future...and things needed to cope during this time.  I always recommend the Bible as the best of help for comfort and reassurance ...you belong here just as much as I and anyone else does...  And I think we can all feel the way you do..we all have a day or daaayyss we feel we don't belong..for me I try to remember to count my blessings. And do the things that make me enjoy life...

It is not our home.imo    If you are feeling that you belong elsewhere, the only avenue imo is a spiritual one.  It will be a personal seemingly unique journey. Most disciplines tend to tell us to go within.  Freedom can be found within.    Once we have travelled down that spiritual road for a time; we probably can see that everyone is doing the same thing:))  Not so unique after all :))))|`|yHfsHp6naa	You can break out of your prison with knowledge and rationality.|`|nHizaTiDaa	Oh my gosh that a big yes for me, too.

ql2fHxxlaa	a soul is recognizing that you exist.    ALLAH LOVES YOU!|`|7NugugsDaa	The spiritual nature of humans, regarded as immortal, separable from the body at death, and susceptible to happiness or misery in a future state.   The disembodied spirit of a dead human.   A human: "the homes of some nine hundred souls" (Garrison Keillor).   The central or integral part; the vital core: "It saddens me that this network ... may lose its soul, which is after all the quest for news" (Marvin Kalb).   A person considered as the perfect embodiment of an intangible quality; a personification: I am the very soul of discretion.   A person's emotional or moral nature: "An actor is ... often a soul which wishes to reveal itself to the world but dare not" (Alec Guinness).   A sense of ethnic pride among Black people and especially African Americans, expressed in areas such as language, social customs, religion, and music.   A strong, deeply felt emotion conveyed by a speaker, a performer, or an artist.   Soul music.|`|nM7xmhgiaa	There is only one soul and we are all in it.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	This question can be approached by so many angles. The soul is the soul. Basically speaking the soul is unconscious, unaware, and has no physical facilities. The base soul is blank/empty. It is equivalent to a state which most would consider death or nonexistence. It is once we start building facilities with that soul that it becomes more complex. But ultimately, in the end, the soul is blank/empty. The problem though is that right now as we sit here we are witness to our existence. So since we can bear witness to our existence at this moment that must mean that when we die and lose our ability to be conscious of our surroundings that we do still exist, but are unable to be conscious of our existence, due to our lack of sensory. Nothing basic in the universe can be destroyed, it can only be changed. Nothing in the universe can enter or leave the universe. The base soul has no concept of time, no senses to sense taste, smell, or light. The base soul does not have a brain to store memories or information. Our brain is like a computer. It stores and processes information but if a computer does not have a hard drive it can not operate. It can not recall or process information because there is no information. Our lack of sensory to be conscious of our existence does not mean we do not exist. We may not exist to ourselves, in a sense, but we still exist nonetheless. As we evolve and grow as living organisms we adopt sensory and the ability to retain information. After almost an eternity of time we have evolved into what we are today. We have eyes to translate energy into forms, shapes, and colors. We have ears which can translate energy waves into sound. We have minds which can store these patterns into memory to recall the information later. Due to the advancements in our physical natures our souls have become more complex. But they are not "our" souls because we do not own our bodies. It is more like our souls are taking a ride in a sensory theatre. Our bodies are just machines which our souls take a ride in. When we die we lose our consciousness again. Where does a soul come from? I couldn't tell you where it comes from but only that it exists as we are here now witnessing it.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	"or is it just a made up CONCEPT?"

(same thing in Hebrew.  I can give you the words if you want)|`|VNrchvUNaa	Made up concept.    If it did exist why can't these questions be answered?:    In a chimera person, where two embryos fuse into one, are there then two souls in that one person? If not, then where does the 'extra' soul go? Or was it never there? Why not? This very well could've been two people instead.    What about one zygote that divides into two separate embryos forming monozygotic (identical) twins? In this case, is it one soul splitting into halves - one half going to each twin? If not, then HOW does each twin get a full soul in the process? What about with triplets? Quadruplets? Quintuplets? Sextuplets? And so on?|`|O3WYA3WGaa	The JWs explain soul pretty well.    http://www.watchtower.org/e/20070715/art...|`|AA11570675	I guess you mean the Jewish-based western Christian idea. In the Hebrew scriptures, the terms body, soul & spirit are virtually interchangeable. The hebrew thinking "I am a living body" can also be rendered with soul or spirit & mean the same thing. Sometimes the 3 terms are used together just for emphasis of a person's humanity or whole being, but any of the 3 terms used alone also refers to the whole being. There are 3 different words for the same thing just like we have lots, loads & even oodles of different words meaning the same thing.  When we move nearer to the present day, we find greek thought coming into the Bible. The greeks separated out the terms body, soul & spirit to refer to different things. As the new testament was originally written in greek & the language reflects the way of thinking of the time, so through the language the idea has spread into Christian thinking. I guess you'd be pretty sure what is & isn't your body wouldn't you? Most probably you'd define it differently from soul or spirit. That's because much of our way of thinking comes from history & language.   Yet all these terms originally meant the whole person.   However, even jews modified their thinking in the light of the possibilities from other language & forms of thought. It doesn't alter the real truth, which most people have probably got wrong in some, maybe most respects. I don't think God's that bothered about the details though & so I wouldn't worry either. Just keep to the basics of understanding that we've fouled up the world, there's a price to pay for it & Jesus has paid the price for that by his death & resurrection.|`|4644ec1ac391913c8f074e3b205f8168aa	From an earlier answer given to the same question.        And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.     For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.         From various Scriptures we can understand that the soul is the immaterial part of man that is his personality, having mind, will and emotion and capable of communion with God through,    the spirit, which is the part of man given by God, having immortal subsistence.    They are designed to subsist in a body through which both the life and the personality are expressed.      It is only through God that we can distinguish between soul and spirit so close and intimate are they.    The spirit of fallen man is dead toward God because of sin, and has weakened and withered so that the soul is dominant and man lives either after his mind, will or emotions if they are the stronger or more developed, or after his carnal appetites.    For man to be restored to know God, rather than just knowing about God, it is necessary for the spirit  to be quickened and strengthened by the work of God's Spirit. The soul must be brought to an awareness of it's sin and of God's glorious goodness and turned from it's natural hatred of God to a humble repentance to seek after and depend upon God through the gift of faith received from Him for this purpose.    The soul is precious beyond the value of even the whole world and the short time spent here asleep and distracted by the temptations and worries of this world is not to be compared to the eternal ages of searing awareness of it's true fallen state.|`|jX6qoxaJaa	It's a concept similar to the concept of having a 'mind' separately from the 'brain'.    I would suggest a good Philosophy course on the study of 'mind', and see what you feel then.  Personally, I don't believe in a soul.      A better question: How are minds/souls connected to the body?|`|EdxUinataa	A soul is that which animates a body.  In some species this could be material in nature.  In humans, the soul is spiritual in nature.  Christian theology teaches that the spiritual soul is infused into every individual by God at conception.    The body and soul act in unison.  Any willful act of the body is an act of the soul.  One could make a strong case that consciousness in only possible by a soul.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	It's mainly your will.  It's made up of your thoughts, feelings and will or desires.  Your spirit is the part of you that hears God, worships God, and can know God.  Those things affect your soul and can be affected by your soul.  But those who are not born again have a dead spirit in them.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	We know THAT  a soul is, first of all. A person is more than the material elements that make them up. You could call a living human being a soul-body composite, though the soul can exist on its own and does keep its experiences when separated, but it requires the sensory equipment of the body in order to learn new things.     http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14153a.h...    Here is Aristotle on the Soul  http://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/32...
lkzTu0Qqaa	I'm sure you know that many religions have an alternate explanation about the origin of the universe than science.  Some religions deney scientific theories and some adjust their beliefs to accomodate science.    In your examples religions that don't deney the scientific premisis you described might say it was a diety (like God) that created the PROCESSES and LAWS that science describes, thereby setting up the stage for the creation of the universe.    To specifically address your question, I don't think I know of any religion that tries to talk about the NEED or JUSTIFICATION for creation.  They usually just differ on who/what/when and how - but do not try to explain why.    This, by the way, is very similar for science.  It deals with what/when/how, but deney there's a who and also doesn't try to explain why.|`|sHCrSIe6aa	****************************************...  **************************************...|`|AA11690436	Well, I think God needed to create Ben Kingsley and even Kate Winslet, and stars of their calibre, but He could have stopped before creating Mary Kate and Ashley, the Simpson Sisters, the Spears Sisters, and the Jonas Brothers.

Since I decided to live, I've been able to travel and have amazing experiences, wonderful lovers, great food and yes, some terrible times as well, but hey, that's life.|`|hqBPRSenaa	I went through a time when I felt a lot like you. I attempted suicide four times. After getting better, my mom was telling me how she thought suicide was selfish - because you don't think about the people you leave behind, and how they feel.    But I also see your side. I think there might be a hint of selfishness in suicide, but it's not completely selfish. Sometimes, things get so bad you can't handle it.    But coming from someone who was in your position, and had life get BETTER, I would say, hang in there. You'll get through it eventually. Find someone to talk to, like a counsler or family member. Sure, it might be humiliating, but it will help. Good luck.|`|4htIOhx6aa	It's considered selfish because you would be hurting those who are close to you.  Think about it, has anyone close to you ever died?  It hurts and probably made you sad.  Do you want to put others through this?  And by committing suicide, everyone who loves you is going to blame themselves, whether there was anything they could have done or not, they will always wonder "what if".  Please don't put others through this.  If you need someone to talk to, please consult a therapist or somebody you feel comfortable talking to.  Things aren't always as bad as you make them seem to be.|`|a8bd16e71ca31170e7af0d30618eac2baa	My history teacher told us this "suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary solution" my life has not been so great for the last six years but since your in this category...try jesus just try its hard you gotta take the good with the bad u dont even have to go to church or buy the bible just google jesus teachings or something just give it try dont kill youself please|`|qhECKgthaa	Suicide is not and never will be selfish.    I'm sure you have family and friends that love you, but let's be honest...will they get over you?  Yes.  Should you live a MISERABLE life to completion just to keep THEM happy? No.  Would them expecting you to do that make THEM selfish?  Yes.    I'm not saying you shouldn't try your best to make life worth living.  But if that doesn't work, it would in NO way be selfish for you to commit suicide.  It would be selfish for your loved ones to expect you to live for them just to make them slightly more happy, when you are miserable and crying yourself to sleep every night.    Anyone who tells you you are selfish or wimpy most likely have never been in your shoes and couldn't begin to imagine your pain.

The big "HEALTH CARE" plan that Obama is proposing will be PAID BY TAXPAYERS. And will cost BILLIONS of YOUR taxes. You are basically paying for your own health care! Everyone wants stuff that is free, but its NOT free when YOUR income pays for it.    YOU are so right. Don't let any of these people on Yahoo tell you otherwise.

I am not American NOR do I live in the US, but the media coverage of this election especially in my country is quite frankly annoying.    After being bombarded with Palin and McCain on our sets, if I ever were a supporter of either candidates, I would be a supporter of Obama.    Your YouTube choice is to be honest, completely typical of someone who is illinformed, who confuses two different genres, and who has yet to come into the world as it is NOW.

God is a trinity of persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father is not the same person as the Son; the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as Father.  They are not three gods and not three beings.  They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all the one God.  Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc., and these are demonstrations of personhood.  They are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful. If any one of the three were removed, there would be no God.|`|wdxTxXHOaa	some are more equal than others    some, are even 'Chosen'|`|AA11440601	Christians believe that Jesus was completely God and completely Man. The incarnation, God and man, is one of the wonderful Christian paradoxes.    The Church thus confesses that Jesus is inseparably true God and true man. He is truly the Son of God who, without ceasing to be God and Lord, became a man and our brother.    The Son of God worked with human hands; he thought with a human mind. He acted with a human will, and with a human heart he loved. Born of the Virgin Mary, he has truly been made one of us, like to us in all things except sin.    The Catechism of the Catholic Church explains what we believe in depth: http://www.nccbuscc.org/catechism/text/p...

And again,           "I WILL BE A FATHER TO HIM           AND HE SHALL BE A SON TO ME"?   6And when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says,           "AND LET ALL THE ANGELS OF GOD WORSHIP HIM."|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Let's see.  1 - First born of all creation  2 - Willing to give himself up (his life) for the rest of us  3 - Willing to give in and live according to the will of the Father  4 - Willing to live a life without sin and sinful thoughts    If you qualify on those points, then yeah.

He died on the cross to save mankind from their sin!!|`|564d359090a6d360bec9ee3849107a51aa	We are not all God's Children. Only those who accept Jesus as their personal savior as the son of God who died on the cross for our sins and rose again on the third day, and you repent of your sins, invite Jesus into your heart and life, turning your life over to Him. If you are not Born Again, you are not a child of God and you cannot go to heaven.Those who are not Born Again Christians remain the property and child of the devil. The Bible teaches us this.     1 Timothy 2:5For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;    Jesus is the son of God who took our place on the cross. That is what makes Him so special.    John 3:3Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.    Romans 10:9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.    2 Corinthians 6:16-18 And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? for ye are the temple of the living God; as God hath said, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.    17 Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you.    18 And will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty.      John 8:44Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.    Sins are not automatically forgiven and covered by the blood of Jesus. You must turn your life over to Jesus and repent of your sins.    Sin separates us from God and Jesus is the one who bridges that gap between us sinners and His Father God. Jesus is the only mediator between us and God. Jesus is the son of God who took our place on the cross and paid the wages of sin with His death. And that is what makes His so special.|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	Only the religious bigots believe that they are adopted because that is what they were told to believe....    and they believed it....Jesus never told anyone they were adopted.  He said "pray to your father which is in heaven." Mankind took it upon himself to write the adoption theory because of the self loathing they were taught to have for themselves by religious folks over the centuries.      ie:  "God couldn't possibly want anything to do with me because I was told by religious bigots that I was so disgusting and such horrible sinful trash that God wants nothing to do with me."    And I believed them!  :)   "Next."    Jesus called them friend, gods, children of the most high.    Mankind made up the adoption story because of their own low self esteem...  Don't fall for the adoption crap.    Jesus is remembered for bringing Love into the world, a moral compass as well.  He is remembered for this because there aren't many shining examples of his morality in the world today.  :)  Especially religion...not a shining example at all.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Jesus is God's Son, by birth.    The rest of us are Sons of Adam, and are adopted by God.    If you've ever had anything to do with an adoption, you know that the love the adoptive parent had for the child is very very real, but the blood line is still nonexistent.    You would also know that the parent adopts the child, not the child adopt the parent.  Adoption is all about the willingness of a loving parent to be responsible for the love and care of someone else's child.  The child does nothing -- it is ALL done through the will of the parent.The parent does all the work, takes all the responsibility.              .|`|TMb076n6aa	Jesus is God and loved us to save us from hell|`|g2XbXYyraa	you're a ******|`|2FTaKXz3aa	Then write one    Im sure there is more then enough people who would be glad to follow|`|K56zvVYXaa	Jesus is gods only child that died for our sins|`|oJ8V9rgiaa	He is the child who saved us all.|`|84981f733d28b73f051420081eec4598aa	jesus sacrifices his life to make every1 live  thats y hes on the cross|`|zXOcVt5Aaa	Because apparantly 'Healed' people by touching them. learn how to do that and Ta da! :L Lol i dunna|`|WuckBywsaa	Jesus is apart of the trinity, that means he is apart of God.

Besides its God the father, God teh Son, God the holy spirit. There are three in one, a God, like a spirit. Sure we are God's children but we sin dont we, jesus does not sin. God loves us all so does jesus and everybody. Sometimes we all go through this question in life, my recomendation is READ THE BIBLE like in the new testament if you really want to understand.

Perfect blood was tainted with sin so we as people could go to Heaven and be with God forever.  if u become a Christian and believe that Jesus Christ died for your sins, and accept His sacrifice, and accept that you sin greatly, u will go to Heaven.  Just to let you know, u already have a book all about u, but its in Heaven, in the Lambs Book of Life, it has everything about u, but its only in the Lambs Book of Life if ur saved and a Christian.    May the Trinity Bless You|`|ZvTbDyxUaa	This is ridiculous.     Jesus is God's physical son, we are only his children metaphorically. Further, Jesus is God because God can take any form at any time, and thus God is in Heaven, and on Earth, and the three separate parts of Him, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, are the Trinity. All claims made herein are justifiable by Christian belief in God.

AA11432517	Your words:  " I want this baby, but I want to know how to explain it to my mom. Thanks."    Why should it be hard to explain? You don't need statistics. You need a plan. How will you support yourself and the baby? Are you expecting your mom to provide a home for you? Are you counting on me, as a taxpayer, to support you through public assistance? Are you getting a job to pay for these things yourself? If so, what about school?    These are the practical things that your friends and family are looking at. Are you? If you are caught up in the warm, fluffy, wanting-a-baby feeling, recognize that the fluffy feeling doesn't feed your baby or pay rent. You will make whatever choice you want. Just make sure that when you do have your newborn you don't suddenly come to the realization of, "now what?"    And BTW, yes, I have had an abortion. I was married, my husband and I lived together, and I had another child. There are times I look back and think, "what if?" but I made the right choice.

Trust me don't do it please.|`|dDMOJWxwaa	Do adoption.    When you had sex, in my book you made your choice "with your woman's body", you do not get to re-choose.  You are killing the voiceless and defenseless.|`|WRn8YipZaa	Wait. So having a bi-racial kid means you can't get a nice guy later?|`|VFWRdAH3aa	the Fifth Commandment states "Thou Shall Not Kill" Abortion is killing of another human being. But besides that I've known women who've gotten abortions and they now suffer from depression and a couple of them have even contemplated suicide because of their choice to have an abortion. Abortion just doesn't kill the innocent baby but it affects the mother and others around her as well.|`|GGUDvicaaa	Good reason?   1. You want to have a child and can take care of him/her or give him/her to adoption. .   2 He/she has not some extremely - and I mean EXTREMELY - serious defects.   Its your life.|`|CODYtcwkaa	Here is a good one:    You don't want one.|`|3cZ4ZJPSaa	Its your body and your baby, that means it is your choice. Do not let them force you into doing anything you dont want to do. Abortion is murder. How old are you? If you are of an age where you can leave home and that then why dont you move out and either raise your baby by yourself or give the baby up for adoption (there are many couples looking for a baby to love). This is a completely personal choice. I had to make it when i was 16. I decided to keep my baby and we now live in our own home and i am at college. Also, you made the choice of the possibility of having a mixed race baby by having sex with a black man so dont even start that as a reason as its horribly racist. Does the father know? If not then i suggest you tell him, he deserves the chance to be involved both physically, emotionally and financially. It is his baby too. All in all, you dont need to make your case. Its your choice, just TELL THEM. Email me if you want to talk. Elle|`|nEc0L0MRaa	Wow, you just ticked me right off.    A good reason to not let someone talk you into an abortion, are you serious?  How about it's your choice and no one else's.  Your body, and if YOU choose, your baby.  Are you so weak that you should obey the popular vote when it comes to your body?  Who gives a flying f*ck what anyone else says?  It's your body, your baby, your choice.  How dare anyone try to enforce their will onto you, you are a grown woman and you are the only one who has the right to place authority on you.  Stand your own damn ground and on your own two feet.    Just for the record, I'm pro-choice.    Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|i6Mi8uWIaa	Well, the best reason is one you've already given yourself: You don't want to have an abortion!     Now, here are some more good reasons to NOT have the abortion.    President Barack Obama: He is biracial, his mother was an unwed teenager, he grew up in a broken home, abandoned by his father. And yet look at what he became, the nation's first African American president. (This is actually the subject of a SuperBowl ad that NBC rejected even though it was PAID FOR.)     Abortion will increase your risks of depression.    Abortion will increase your risks of alcohol and drug abuse.    Abortion will increase your risk of future miscarriage.    Abortion is the MURDER of an innocent baby.    Abortion will increase yoru risks of blood clots, uterine cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and DEATH.     Abortion carries with it the risk of such complications of a perforated uterus, which will result in DEATH.     The abortion might be botched, resulting in a baby born alive, or carried to term but born without limbs or other special needs, which will actually make life harder on the baby.     There is the risk of heavy bleeding, infection, sepsis, damage to the cervix, damage to the uterine lining (resulting in endometriosis, a VERY painful condition), and damage to other internal organs.    You will regret it for the rest of your life. Your heart will be broken.    And that's just the tip of the iceberg.    Your baby is already very much alive! I don't know how far along you are, but if you want to know where your baby is in development, there's a wonderful week-by-week pregnancy calendar here. http://kidshealth.org/PageManager.jsp?dn...    80% of all abortions are the result of the mother being forced or coerced. If you have the abortion, you'll be one of that 80%.    Remember: no child is unwanted. If you truly feel you cannot raise your child, that you cannot accept this blessing, pass the blessing to someone else. There are many, MANY couples out there waiting to adopt, and you can be a major part of the process. You can actively choose the parents who adopt your child. You can also choose, if you wish, an open adoption. In this format, you get to keep in contact with your child!     Also, you said you're in college. If you choose to keep your child, check and see if your school provides daycare for its students! If the college you attend offers a degree in early childhood development and/or in elementary education, chances are that yes, it does, for free or EXTREMELY low cost. The college I attend has a child care center (which I work in), and the cost per child is less than what most teen babysitters want!     The greatest tool that can be used against abortion is education! I wish you luck, honey. Don't let ANYBODY talk you into having an abortion for ANY reason!     If you need more help, here's a huge list of websites that you can use to show your friends and family who are trying to pressure you into murdering your innocent unborn child.    http://www.abortiontv.com/Glitch/Abortio...  http://www.abortiontv.com/Lies%20&%20Myt...  http://www.abort73.com/HTML/I-case.html  http://www.abort73.com/HTML/II-A-abortio...  http://hopeafterabortion.com/hope.cfm?se...  http://www.ramahinternational.org/aborti...

It's your choice, not theirs.    Personally, I think you should get an abortion because if you just started college, you might not be ready for it, but who knows.|`|96wixYvMaa	If it honestly depends on your amount of "class" on having a multiracial child, then it doesn't deserve you.|`|FOCPDsxbaa	Because the bible shows God's concern for the unborn fetus which is a clear admonition against abortion Exodus 21:22-23, Psalms 139:13-16, If God considers it murder, we should too Exodus 20:13, Genesis 9:6, this doesn't make your choice any easier, but theses are the facts

SaQ5d420aa	And you want to do this why?  Let's see, you are gay and want to have sex with a guy who does not look at you as a sex partner...would he date you at least .. would he give you the time of day?  Yes, I've met gay guys who think they are doing the world a service by showing the straight world how wonderful gay sex is.  Me: I think there are many gay guys out there hungry for a partner to even just share a cup of coffee with and not have to be afraid of letting on they are attracted to men.  Spread a little REAL LOVE: give a gay person some of your time and leave the straight folks to find you and make a friend.

3ZgOAUOTaa	because that's what the original words meant...|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Plato, as usual, the Republic :  one must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upward and leads us from this world to another|`|3ZzlrChgaa	Because God refers to the sky/space as heavens and hell as burning brimstone.    Its an anthropomorphism to help us humans understand what is actually a spiritual reality.    Heaven is a spiritual relationship with God(being with an infinite God). Hell is a spiritual separation from God (farthest away from God, alone) and must seem like burning.|`|cByRtCC9aa	Probably some outdated cultural gesture that dates back to when the sun was worshipped. Many traditions of today were routed in some sort of religious superstition at some point.    Also, many people think of Heaven as being above, and therefore, "up there".|`|jSux4kt1aa	It might be because the sun was one of the first entities man started to worship and, needless to say, the sun is in the sky!   Also, consider that in ancient times there was no clear distinction between a 'physical plane' and a 'spiritual plane' ... so people actually believed that god or (the gods) was literally OUT THERE somewhere. And since he was obviously not anywhere to be found on earth, than it was easy to assume he was somewhere in outer space, in the sky. Today with astronomy and space exploration we find it harder to believe that god is PHYSICALLY somewhere up there in the universe, but that's what some people probably thought in ancient times.    As to why hell is usually underground, I'm not sure; but if I had to guess I'd say that it's simply because that's where dead people are: underground. And if you don't go to heaven (up in the sky), then there's nowhere else to go for a dead person than to stay down below.

And you can read Becker's Denial of Death and be scared out of your mind.     The Republic, Book ONE  "For let me tell you, Socrates, that when a man thinks himself to be near death, fears and cares enter into his mind which he never had before; the tales of a world below and the punishment which is exacted there of deeds done here were once a laughing matter to him, but now he is tormented with the thought that they may be true: either from the weakness of age, or because he is now drawing nearer to that other place, he has a clearer view of these things; suspicions and alarms crowd thickly upon him, and he begins to reflect and consider what wrongs he has done to others. And when he finds that the sum of his transgressions is great he will many a time like a child start up in his sleep for fear, and he is filled with dark forebodings.

His neighbor said he'd be at home since he lost his job.That scripture is wonderful it says soon everyone will have satisfying work, their own home, garden, etc...    3) I hope Mrs. So & so is at home. I feel sorry for her since her husband died. I want to bring her this brochure about seeing our dead loved ones again. Plus, I baked her a nice cake, she said she loves carrot cake.    4) I just love coming to this house. The people are so nice. They are the perfect family along with their dog. They just need God in their life. At least they are talking to me even though they are atheists.    5) That man was nice even though he wasn't interested. He said he had his own religion, I respect that. Everyone should act like him, esp. if they claim to be Christian. Jesus expects us to be respectful to others.    6) I feel so bad that I woke that man up. I knocked lightly hoping someone else was up in the house. I don't see a sign that says day sleeper, but i'll make a note of it and come back later in the day.    7) It felt good to find someone home this morning. It was so difficult to get out today. Everything went wrong. I didn't even know how I was going to put gas in the car until Bro.Elder gave me some gas money.  It cost money to go out in the ministry full-time. I'll buy my new dress maybe next month. It's worth it to see people light up when they see the answers to their questions, in their own bibles. It's sad to think that people misjudge us thinking we sell magazines and bibles. All our literature is free. Of course if someone wanted to make a donation we could put it in the donation box to pay for more literature. It cost alot more money to make literature than what they know.     8) My last house today and I'm so happy it was with someone that listened. We just want people to be happy. The bible speaks about a hope for all mankind. Paradise. Next time I visit with her I want to be sure and not talk about the Garden of Eden all the way to Revelation. I sure don't want it to look like I'm shoving it down her throat. I would never do that. Now, I may get excited a bit when I talk to someone, but it's because people's lives are at stake. Jehovah wants everyone to live. He doesn't desire anyone to be destroyed. If more people would take the time and listen they would see how wonderful Jehovah is.|`|37LKDbtsaa	They wake me up at 7am on a Saturday...That's a crime against humanity.|`|5cd72c27261c5c994c0b5c7e6eed47dfaa	There is nothing that's more wrong about JW when compared to all other religions.|`|LLey4VRzaa	They may walk around, but they don't help anyone.

The same could arguably be said about many, many things. Gay  or plural marriage.  Well-regulated drug legalization, as well as gambling, and prostitution.  Unrestricted Nudism (my personal favorite).  Witchcraft.  The list goes on.    If you could honestly say that these are valid lifestyles that you could accept for others, then I'd agree that the JW's lifestyle is just as valid.  However, we humans, being social animals, tend to impose our viewpoints on others (mostly unintentionally), sometimes just through a visual assault (see Nudism).  Unfortunately, "live and let live" only works for so long.|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	Some of my family members are Jehovah's witenesses and I wouldn't want to join that religion, there's nothing wrong with them. They're not a cult. You're exactly right, it's a group of people working to be good people. No one is benefiting from it, the "elders" don't get paid, everything is contribution based. They read the same bible we all do, the only big difference is that they call God Jehovah, they don't celebrate holidays and they go door to door to preach. Other than that, they believe the SAME exact thing other religions do|`|BLTq0vLWaa	Nothing apart from the fact they try and force their beliefs on other people.  Let me think what I want!    Apart from that I'm sure there lovely people ;)|`|2FTaKXz3aa	There really isnt anything weird or crazy about them. You are not wrong. Some of the things they teach can be pretty radical, but when it comes to the bible, whats wrong with being that way? Isn't the bible pretty radical itself?    When i say radicle, its stuff that i sometimes would giggle at when i was at the meetings. Nothing to be scared of, nothing to be frightened for... etc.        No one is benefiting off the donations. The donations strictly go to the making of the free literature and free bibles they print at the organization in Brooklyn, New York.    EDIT:   I think people are so annoyed of them because they preach with the bible and go from door to door, and they are swift to call them a clut because this is not the "norm". But in reality, if you are a christian, you should be imitating Jesus & the other prophets of the bible and preaching the word of your God. Isnt that what Jesus himself told his followers to do?    Kevin Thompson:  The people who deserve everlasting life are going to live on a paradise earth the way God intended for mankind to live. That is the rest of the Jehovahs Witnesses and the ones in the world who are willing to submit to God come judgement day. The ones in heaven will serve in Heaven beside Jesus, acting as judges when the appointed time of judgement comes, or ever will.|`|dcDY9pJeaa	good points to consider     outside of the "annoying" theres nothing really more wierd then all the other religions|`|FOCPDsxbaa	You are very correct, as a matter of fact one of the defining articles of a cult is that someone has to benefit at the top either financiallly or by the power they exhort, and as you have seen no one in the organization does. Another defining article of a cult is that it has to break away from mainstream religion, and JW base all of their teachings squarely on the bible, if it's not in the bible we won't say it 2Timothy 3:16, some people may disagree with what we say but they won't say it's not there in the bible, they may even say that it's not to be taken so literally, but they won't argue that it's not in the bible. So the RULES that people say we have aren't actually rules, they are bible principles and many people chaffe at the idea of living their lives based on ALL the bible principles they even say that it's impossible, but millions do it every day, some that aren't even Jehovah's Witnesses. So I invite you to look in your bible (hopefully KJV) at Exodus 6:3, and Psalms 83:18 and Romans 10:13-15, and you'll understand more why we preach from door to door|`|FZM15NXtaa	Teaching people to obey Jehovah God and the Lord Jesus Christ is hardly "mind control."    Perhaps you have the wrong paradigm in thinking that Jehovah's Witnesses might be a cult.    Many people don't like to be told what to do, not even by God Almighty.    But Jehovah's Witnesses recognize that God's laws, principles, and instuctions all work to our benefit.    You are correct that no one is getting rich out of being one of Jehovah's Witnesses.  Most of us expend our own time, resources, and finances to support what we do.    What we do get out of it is the assurance that we are living as God wants us to live, and the knowledge that this leads to blessings both now and in the world to come.    The Lord Jesus Christ declared: "If you love me, you will keep my commandments."  (John 14:15)  Was Jesus practicing "mind control"?|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Our motivation for witnessing to people is our love for God & to ultimately save lives.  Our message is that we are now living in the last days before God steps in & restores this wicked world back to how it was in the first place. We share with other people the good news that the earth is going to restored to paradise conditions where there will be no sickness, death or suffering. The dead will come back to live on earth. We also are doing a warning work. We fully believe that those who don't respond favourably to the warning message will perish like those in the flood of Noah's day. - Matthew 24:37  2 Timothy 3:1-5    So when you look at it from our point of view... we are motivated to share this message with people out of love. We want everyone to be saved & enjoy a wonderful future.   Psalm 37:29    In answer to your question asking why people are negative toward us.  We believe that Satan has temporary rulership of the earth & he doesn't want any to be saved. He will try any means to prevent the good news being spread.  1 John 5:19  2 Corinthians 4:3,4|`|yz6qXwUiaa	As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I have to tell you that I don't FEEL "mind controlled" at all.  What I feel is convinced.  I personally think that there is a VAST difference.    Isn't it simply possible that someone can feel they are right because they ARE right?  We study the Bible.  We learn from it and we understand it.  We strive to do what it says.  This is all personal choice.  No one coerses us or twists our arms or puts us in little rooms and refuses to let us go to the bathroom without permission (as I've heard some "cults" do).  On the contrary, we ask questions and answer them from the Bible.  People learn from us and get satisfying answers that they become convinced are TRUE.    How is that mind control?  Persuasion perhaps.  But persuasion using the power of reason, not going against it.    Is this any different from going to any school and asking and learning the answers to any questions the school might ask? No.  Our knowledge comes from the highest authority of all, God's Word, but there is no mind control going on.    Do we give our money to an organization?  Some of it.  Is someone getting rich? No not any individual.  Our organization handles large sums of money, but it must.  Printing presses, paper and ink and the buildings to put them in, shipping costs etc, and not cheap.  And we print Bibles, tracts, and various Bible literature and distribute it FREE to anyone who wants it.    I just bought a Bible at a bookstore.  I paid 35 or more dollars for it.  Why did I buy one when I can get one free at my Kingdom Hall?  Because it was a different translation that we don't publish.  So if you multiply that 35 dollars by all the Bibles, books etc we distribute for free, you COULD make a huge amount of money.  But we aren't about money.  As I said, all of our literature is distributed for free.  Donations? sure if your heart moves you to want to help with this work, but if not? we will still give you any literature that you would like to read that we publish.    So how then are we a "mind-controlling cult?"  NOT.  That is just a smear campaign, people trying to link us with all the Shysters out there who ARE out to make money.  That is NOT true of Jehovah's Witnesses.  We want to help people come to know Jehovah.  We want to let them know what the Bible says that is good news about the future of our planet and about what God's purpose and plan is for all of mankind.    They are free to tell us to go away and not bother to listen, but no one is forced|`|4htIOhx6aa	I don't see anything wrong with them, it's just annoying when they come to my door and try to shove their beliefs down my throat!|`|8179167c86c2a954054ffc06276ae83caa	the watchtower earnt $951 million last year. not bad.  they are a false prophet, as can easily be proved by examining their prophetic history. when armageddon didn't happen in 1914, they changed it to christ's invisible presence, which previously had been 1874. as such, deut 18:20-22 proclaims them to be under a death sentence. so all they can impart to their followers is death, regardless of how pretty their sheep clothing is.|`|TdP2k2VGaa	they wake me up really early that pissed me off|`|2pA9an5Waa	My spouse is JW...she is extemely horrible.  I can tell you first hand. We are now separated she did not convert me after 10 years So she created horrific drama with the police etc.  She did the same thing to her father, her uncle and her cousin.  There were probably more but I have only known her for 11 years.  Her and all associated JW get together and decide who to oust because they did not convert after 10 years.  I have proof.  My older son saw it first hand too.    Now I am stuck and dont know what to do because we have two young children.  She is trying her best to get the children to hate me and all relations on my side.  JW hate catholics and gays.  So she told everybody including her aunt that her uncle is gay.  This is one way on how her and her family destroy marriages.  I am Catholic and did not convert, so now she is desparate to make the children say bad things about me.  But they love me and their older brother so much that they have not fell for their mother's terrible acts.      JW are absolutely horrible and I have all the proof in the world.    She also committed adultery with a married man.  She told me that I cannot prove it, so I told her that I will pay for a lie detector test.  She went crazy mad, slapped me, kicked me, punched me and said all the bad words she can.  So she will not take the test because that is the only way for the truth to come out of her.  According to JW we are not entitled to the truth and she really believes that.  But she knows that the lie detector test will capture the truth so she will not do it.
c0125a2c9826a9b04968f2c2fcc1d60faa	No, but I'm a good listener.   I'll say a prayer for you.|`|4737dab527209296cddace0d73d42a5daa	I have a friend who is lying about her sexual orientation, she is also dating a co worker, who she now defends every chance she gets even though the girl is the worst worker we have. I don't know what to do, I bring up how the girl is not working to her (shes also my boss) and she could care less, i have even heard her telling the girlfriend what is going on and what she needs to watch out for which makes me even more upset because now the girl knows I am watching her and they are conspiring against me basically. Now I am next inline after my boss so really I should be able to do something about this girls non work and lateness.  If your wondering how I know this for sure, I recently went on a trip with my boss for work. every waking minute she was on her cell phone, I mean it if we weren't eating, or watching the work stuff we were supposed to watch she was on the phone, on the plane she even turned the phone on when it was supposed to be off to text her, in the taxis, while she was in the bathroom,  even before the food got to us when we were out to eat. Needless to say I was a bit bored seeing as it was just the two of us on the trip. I asked her once who she was talking to she said it was a new guy she was seeing but would nevr say his name. Well once we were in the taxi and it was quiet and I heard the girl from works voice over th phone, I asked when she hung up and she said it was the guy. Then when I used her phone to call home there were no different numbers in the phone, they were all too and from the same person named "baby". and back at the office there are other signs and changes that have taken place with how they act. I don't know how to handle it cause to call her on it is basically bring her out of the closet, and will probably ruin allot of things at work.  But I don't know how much longer I can take dealing with the slacker getting away with not working.

JseyoIfLaa	Well her thoughts on the subject are only one take on the matter. Who says you even need a body to have your mind go on forever? It would be much more practical to preserve the intelligence rather than the physicality that house it.Virtual realty makes that option much more attractive and you could use avatars to react with the real or outside world. For more ideas on this subject check out the book "The Physics Of Immortality" by Frank J. Tipler. He has an even more interesting idea about how people who have been dead for a long time can resurrected.    Okay, now as to whether it would disprove god I don't think so. In fact, maybe you could argue that man is creating god.|`|elAfZpqaaa	NOPE, cuz even Vampires die eventually.    You might have an accident and have your head chopped off or something.  Until scientists can stop someone from dying after being in a woodchipper, then sooner or later you will die!    Besides, what or who created life in the first place???    Immortality is an ILLUSION|`|liGEQEz4aa	You could say immortality PROVES God, since God told us from the beginning that there is eternal life.....as for its being on this earth, no....If you want to prove me wrong, you'll have to have a discussion with God about it to prove where He plans on continuing the eternal life He promised....and the only way to do that is to pray, since God is a spiritual being.  Good luck with that--best to get started now. Let us know what He tells you.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	Oh yes, Aubrey...     Well If he is right, and Immortality becomes a reality, and death is no longer an issue (which also supposed there are no more accidents and such) Then no one will die, which means there will be no one going to any afterlife, which makes the afterlife moot.    So Yes in a sense, Immortality will make the whole religion thing look silly.|`|ViZH5twNaa	No, what if such a deity was himself immoral.    As evidence I give you the Old Testament. I would like to highlight one story in particular, Numbers 31.    Anyways, immorality is relative. It depends on every individuals perspective on individual issues. Is it immoral to kill one person to save two others? Is it immoral to steal for a greater good? Is it immoral to lie to protect others? Some would say yes and others might say no matter if they are generally moral or not.|`|pYrooh0Haa	Immortality is impossible.    We might be able to extend life considerably but eventually  (and I'm talking in billions of years) all the suns in the universe will run out of fuel and all the atoms in the universe will break down into subatomic particles.    No, I agree that we will be able to extend life and probably be able to download our consciousnesses into computers. But eventually everything turns into subatomic particles so immortality is IMPOSSIBLE. If you don't understand what I'm telling you then you need to learn more about the fundamental laws of the universe.

Second, immortality means you cannot die. That is, if I chop off your head, you will still die if something isn't done in a very big hurry. Immortality would imply invincibility and that isn't what de Grey is talking about.    For believers, if God knows how to bring about immortality (life beyond death), then there is no reason why God would not reveal it to makind, if he wanted to.|`|M7r8oaUzaa	yes to answer your first question, this would actually make people stop believeing in christianity because they dont have to act "good" to get into heaven. because... well if they didnt die... they'd never get there anyway    it should also be noted that if everyone stayed alive and reproduced... thered be alot of F*ckin people|`|MVY8xhXlaa	Mutually exclusive- God is the highest level of power, like on a pyramid and we could not exist one second without his constand love and attention    This is not dogmatic, but is evident in man's conscience and all of nature|`|QqxZzvbAaa	it wont happen.  whether you believe it or not the bible says that it is appointed to ALL men to die .|`|VDTTzwlUaa	Immortality cannot be scientifically possible as people can still be killed. You assume that nobody ever has car accidents, is murdered or anything like that. As far as prolonging life, we are going to run out of space on this earth and we won't have enough food to feed people. Then we will die of starvation. We don't even know how the human brain exactly works so how can replicate it and replace it to keep someone going? Science isn't anywhere close to that currently; we don't even have a full cure for diabetes or certain types of cancers.    God and immortality are mutually exclusive. God could easily have created everything and just left it alone. Also, immortality as you see it is just prolonging life. At first I thought you were saying that immortality was disproven by science, something that cannot be necessarily proven or disproven as far as I know.    I would like it if it happened in my lifetime, but even more so I would prefer to have some other physical conditions fixed.    Really I would just like some clear proof that a specific religion is right or proof that none of them are right so I can either a) have a limited life now for the one later or b) do as I please now.

Jess, entre sus muchas ense?anzas, predico el amor al prjimo, de una manera incondicional, algo que es muy bello pero, tambin muy difcil de hacer, entonces y ahora.  Las ense?anzas de Jess, fueron verdaderamente revolucionarias en su mundo y en su tiempo, en el que ense?o esto y muchas cosas mas, como mas igualdad para las mujeres, el no hacer caso a las autoridades injustas, ataco a la religin Juda, a las autoridades, al sistema social y muchas cosas mas que eran injustas y denigraban a los seres humanos haciendolos menos libres y egoistas con sus semejantes.  Estos fueron los motivos por los que las autoridades Judias, desde que se dieron cuenta de lo que hacia, trataron de eliminarlo y no pararon hasta que lo consiguieron, pues si lo ves con detenimiento, Jesus era peligrosisimo para el sistema establecido y los privilegiados de este sistema.  Jesus, si bien es cierto que no era un "Comunista" si es verdad que fue un verdadero reformador social, y muchos de los principios que el propago, fueron recogidos bajo una optica diferente por las tendencias politicas "Socialistas" no comunistas que es diferente, en estos tiempos el que ya no existte es el comunismo , las tendencias llamadas de izquierda o socialistas siguen siendo vigentes y fuertes, en pocas palabras Jesus si fue uno de los primeros proponentes de una especie de verdadero "Socialismo".

Trying to determine the beliefs of such a manipulative person by analysing his public statements is clearly not very reliable.  There seems to be a reasonable level of evidence to show that Hitler was a Christian for at least some of his life, but later he made conflicting statements about his religious views and so unless some more concrete evidence is provided I don't think we can really be sure about what Hitler believed.  But one thing we do know with some certainty is that the vast majority of the people who carried out atrocities in Hitler's name were Christians.|`|FBrwlhPtaa	No. He was a Pagan:    Was Hitler a Christian?     The allegation is sometimes made that Hitler was a Catholic - a Christian until the day he died. This claim is based upon the fact that Hitler was born and raised in a Catholic family.     However, as an adult, Hitler specifically rejected the Catholic Church, as well as Christianity in general. He described himself as "a complete pagan".     The book Hitler's Secret Conversations: 1941-1944, published by Farrar, Straus and Young, Inc. (1953), contains definitive proof of Hitler's real views.

Now, some Christians who don't want to claim him will say "but he wasn't a GOOD Christian."  They miss the point; they are commanded not to judge him in their own scriptures, they consider themselves to be sinners also, and no Christian has the authority to deny anyone the right to profess to be Christian.    So he was one of the Christians who were brutal and depraved despite their faith.  I can point out similar genocidal madmen from just about every faith position, including atheist.

Well, I'm not Roman Catholic, but I know some about it.  I'm sure they still teach church history in Catholic high schools - which means that they do an overview of the inquisition.      2) Can anyone justify these deaths?    No.      3) How could so called christians do such a thing?    The same way so-called Christians do *all* of the sins that they do.  Roman Catholics - then or now - are no more sinless than any other sort of Christian.      4) That would of never happened, if it was the true church.    You are confusing the sinful and erroneous decisions of individuals with the Christian church.  IF the leader of the "true church" - regardless of which sect of Christianity you believe that to be - announce today that all his followers should, well, let's say "kill all abortion doctors" - does that one person's choice mean that your "true church" is suddenly no longer the "true church"?  And if some members of your "true church" obeyed this instruction, does *that* mean that your "true church" is suddenly no longer the "true church"?    Your criteria for evaluating what is the "true church" is severely flawed.  The "true church" cannot be identified by the actions of any individual or group of individuals.  There is no "church" that does not have sinners within its organization - including the leaders.    The inquisition is inexcusable in light of Christian morality, certainly.  So are actions taken (historically) by officials in every other single Christian sect of which I am aware.  There isn't a single one - other than those that are *very* recent - which has not had officials guilty of appalling sins.    I guess, using your evaluation technique, NONE of them are the "true church"....    OR, you can take the view that no church organization can, today, be held guilty of the sins of past officials.  This, after all, is the *biblical* way to look at it.

Don't play the victim to something you weren't even alive for.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	So, you are basically blaming people today for something that happened hundreds of years ago?? HMM|`|HQKuzxulaa	It amazes me how many terrible things are done in the name of religion, whether it was 5 century ago or at the present time.|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	Gee, no, we've never heard of them....    For cryin out loud.    There have actually been several different inquisitions. The first was established in 1184 in southern France as a response to the Catharist heresy. This was known as the Medieval Inquisition, and it was phased out as Catharism disappeared.     Quite separate was the Roman Inquisition, begun in 1542. It was the least active and most benign of the three variations.     Separate again was the infamous Spanish Inquisition, started in 1478, a state institution used to identify conversosJews and Moors (Muslims) who pretended to convert to Christianity for purposes of political or social advantage and secretly practiced their former religion. More importantly, its job was also to clear the good names of many people who were falsely accused of being heretics. It was the Spanish Inquisition that, at least in the popular imagination, had the worst record of fulfilling these duties.     The Church has nothing to fear from the truth. No account of foolishness, misguided zeal, or cruelty by Catholics can undo the divine foundation of the Church, though, admittedly, these things are stumbling blocks to Catholics and non-Catholics alike.     What must be grasped is that the Church contains within itself all sorts of sinners and knaves, and some of them obtain positions of responsibility. Paul and Christ himself warned us that there would be a few ravenous wolves among Church leaders (Acts 20:29; Matt. 7:15).     Fundamentalists suffer from the mistaken notion that the Church includes only the elect. For them, sinners are outside the doors. Locate sinners, and you locate another place where the Church is not.     Just what do you think the existence of the Inquisition demonstrates? That Catholics are sinners? Guilty as charged. That at times people in positions of authority have used poor judgment? Ditto. That otherwise good Catholics, afire with zeal, sometimes lose their balance? All true, but such charges could be made even if the Inquisition had never existed and perhaps could be made of some Fundamentalists.     The first Protestants also tried to root out and punish those they regarded as heretics. Luther and Calvin both endorsed the right of the state to protect society by purging false religion. In fact, Calvin not only banished from Geneva those who did not share his views, he permitted and in some cases ordered others to be executed for "heresy" (e.g. Jacques Gouet, tortured and beheaded in 1547; and Michael Servetus, burned at the stake in 1553). In England and Ireland, Reformers engaged in their own ruthless inquisitions and executions. Conservative estimates indicate that thousands of English and Irish Catholics were put to deathmany by being hanged, drawn, and quarteredfor practicing the Catholic faith and refusing to become Protestant. An even greater number were forced to flee to the Continent for their safety. I  point this out to show that the situation was a two-way street; and both sides easily understood the Bible to require the use of penal sanctions to root out false religion from Christian society.     The fact that the Protestant Reformers also created inquisitions to root out Catholics and others who did not fall into line with the doctrines of the local Protestant sect shows that the existence of an inquisition does not prove that a movement is not of God. Protestants cannot make this claim against Catholics without having it backfire on themselves.|`|gkffZHF2aa	The "true church" must be composed of impeccably perfect people, then, instead of just plain old sinners saved by grace.    This is hardly a "skeleton in the closet", sister.  It's historical fact and I've never heard a Catholic try to deny it.      You really have NO point at all, except of course that you think whatever church you belong to is the "true" church and Catholics aren't Christian by your definition.  Thankfully, you aren't making the rules.|`|ptIIkqq0aa	They sinned. No one is perfect. The way you worded it made it sound as if everything is the Catholic Churches fault. Non-Catholics have done the same thing.|`|bXeHr69Vaa	which one there were many, and there were not the number you have suggested. in fact a lot of people charged with those crimes demanded to be judged by the church.    also remember the royal families had christians hung,drawn and quartered, even children for stealing a loaf of bread|`|MMImKRAgaa	I dont believe it is an Christian identity, but another way corrupt men have done in the name of Christ|`|KaiL6iUJaa	I think any even minimally educated person in the world knows about that.    True religion -- I guess that's what you think you have.  trust me, I did too at one point, until I realized it was a corporation, not a religion.    Take a look, an honest, hard look, at your own religion, and I think you may be less inclined to cast stones at other religions.

However, I think that children should be encourage to think for themselves and to not believe every fairytale an adult tells them.  Religion attempts to brain wash kids, as early as possible.  I remember in high school, I'd have friends that would go away to youth group retreats, and come back feeling like they should break up with their boyfriends because their boyfriends weren't catholic.  Now that shi* is ridiculous.  Who in their right mind thinks it is ok to brain wash kids to the point that they  think it is wrong to date a Jewish guy when they are catholic?  It is just wrong.|`|AA11914997	they're playing you, you obviously took the bait|`|AA12363172	I think you (and most everyone else who answered) missed the point.

The Universal Energies create a circle that has no beginning or end, in other words life perpetuates and continues to Evolve within Mother Nature.Humans must learn to live life in a non destructive way, otherwise all that has been created will be destroyed.The Earth would still exist it would only be lacking in Human Population.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	you smoke alot of weed, its cool man...i understand |`|ij5Sv6staa	My humble opinion.    God created time for man's sake. God does not need time "time" to exist.    Someday, in the afterlife, I believe God will share with us all his mysteries, including what he did before he made the universe.    I believe that those who find favor with God will one day become "God like" (not replacing God, but having God like powers) and will be granted the authority to create things on their own (i.e. planets, galaxies, life forms, etc).    OR    we are just another of God's science projects which he will throw in the trash and start over on the next one until he can ultimately create a man that doesn't sin and rebel against him.    |`|U7sBZKUuaa	Before the creation of the universe, there was no space/time so it is not accurate to think about Him wasting away endless hours playing solitaire. We are drowning in the arrow of time, but it is not that way out side of our existence. It's not easy to think about, but before the universe there was eternity simply because there was no time at all. Therefore, to consider anything happening before the creation is a fallacy.|`|S2Wp2Vjsaa	Go to nearest beach, dig a hole, let the sea water  fill the hole. Your brain represents the hole and the ocean represents God's knowledge.  As far as the potter working with clay, it's that first of all the potter has to select the right clay  many different kinds of clay, many different colors, different consistencies and textures, but some types of clay work better with certain types of pottery. So, obviously there are some choices to make here. Clay of itself has very little value, but once it's been molded and shaped and prepared and finished by a professional, by a master craftsman, it can be something very beautiful and something very enduring; it can be a beautiful work of art. But the potter begins by choosing carefully the right kind of clay. That reminds us of John Chapter 15, Verse 16, it's a familiar verse to us, just like the potter carefully chooses his clay, God carefully and individually chooses each of us. We don't see what goes on in Heaven; we don't hear the discussions that are taking place. But God, according to the Scriptures, carefully selects individuals to become the first fruits, members of His church now, and eventually members of the first fruits, the first ones to be born into His family at Christ's return. We didn't volunteer for this, we didn't choose this anymore than physical clay chooses its own potter.|`|zUMvC6QEaa	God's ways are not man's ways.|`|fvu5KTFQaa	Do you have any idea what I was just doing 5 minutes ago?

LuN1unJ3aa	Yes and no. Some happenings are pure coincidence while other happenings are by our own making and still others are by other peoples' makings. Sometimes, God will intervene, but it may appear to be a coincidence.    How we handle those situations teaches us about ourselves and our nature. We can enjoy life and what it offers and make the best of every situation or we can mope around in our own sorrow. It really largely is up to us, but we need to be aware of the rules of the game, or we'll find ourselves in a bad situation.|`|wwdllMzYaa	not really    i think every action has its own cause and effect, hence NOTHING is a "coincidence"  its all set by each action, each reaction    why do i think this, because i see it far too often, soemon did soemthing andit always affects them, and others, thats cause and effect  its the universal law  i just accept it    as for the spiritual side, ie fate, yes i do also beleive in soemthing like that too  and what happens is not coincidence but communications    why i think this, again due to my experiences, due to my knowledge and own theorys and thoughts, and what seems logical and probable to me|`|J7KSKm54aa	Nothing is written in stone, many things are sheer coincidence.   Many times Om arranges for us to meet a soul mate- so that is not a coincidence.|`|lkxFy681aa	Yes, I am one of those people with logic who think a coincidence is a coincidence.

You may not have all the "evidence" you need yet, and your parents are just trying to look out for you and act in your best interest.    But you may have had a lot of stuff happen to you in this world and you are sure your not a religious person.

I know one family who did this with their son until he was 18 and to be honest he sat there with his head down in a book and his earphones in.  In many ways it was off putting for others.    However, another child of a family said his parents made him go to church and now he is in his 20s he is so glad that they did!    Personally I think that when you become old enough to make your own decisions and are old enough to be left home alone - and wont steal all the cookies whilst everyone else is at church like my son does haha! then you decide for yourself.    My son is 13 and I would not make him come along now unless he wanted to.  He's never usually up in time anyway.    In many ways there is no right or wrong answer, however, as long as you live in your parents home as a minor then you have to go along with the house rules whether you like them or not.|`|FOCPDsxbaa	It's there responsibility Deuteronomy 6:6-7, the same as it is for them to see you grow up healthy, eating your vegetables, looking both ways when you cross the street, and feeding and clothing you.

Remember us on the holidays. Remember just to call once in a while and say how glad you are to talk to us, even if for a few minutes. Visit us once in a while and be a good listener.    Trouble getting to the stores and buy food. Maybe it hurts to drive to the store and get out from the house. Spend one day a week and take us out to the store, or help us with yard work, house work.

XoNuUrYoaa	Orange parades came about when William of Orange from Holland bet the English Catholics in the battle Battle of the Boyne in Ireland.    Orange parades exist today in Northern Ireland and Scotland.For some Protestants they are a celebration their heritage and the survival.For other Protestants they are a way of taunting the larger local Catholic population.For Catholics they are intimidating and just to humiliate them.    Orange orders were once respectable institutions.Upstanding Protestant men were invited to join them.One could not request to join,one had to be invited.But today anyone can join, any thug.    Both of my mom's grandfathers were in the orange order in Northern Ireland,but both left when they saw how the orders were becoming.Orange orders are dwindling, many lodges are closed and others are shabby,so to keep members up and money into the lodges, boys and women can join.|`|AA12349214	It stems from way back in history and William of Orange - his followers were known as the Orangemen and indeed it is a celebration of all things protestant.  But dear god in heaven we shouldnt still be celebrating our divides but our diversity and unity.  Religion is responsible for so many fights, arguments, wars and lord knows what else.  Why cant we all just accept that we worship a higher being of our choice and that choice doesnt have to be the same as any one elses?  You shouldnt be persecuted for that any more than you should for supporting Man U or Man City for heavens sake.|`|KJHt4hiYaa	Different things. Where I live in Scotland it's mainly to show solidarity with the protestant community in Northern Ireland. To some people though it has a broader purpose and celebrates the reformation and glorious revolution and the protestant traditions of the UK. There is unfortunately also an element of bigotry involved with some marchers.      Edit- I don't hate Catholics at all and I'm opposed to any bigotry but I support the democratic rights of unionists in Northern Ireland who want to remain a part of the UK.|`|3rRV3yMZaa	christly blessings unto my sweet -n- godly bible|`|r8qJecrMaa	F*** knows!  What goes on in the minds of the people of Northern Ireland is a complete mystery to anyone outside of the province and particularly to us Brits who have suffered the mainland bombings when we don't actually give a crap!  Edit: The British Army were sent in originally to uphold the peace and to protect the Catholic minority from persecution which had become widespread and intolerable to British Law!  What happened next was an escalation of violence and religious and political bigotry on BOTH sides! And the troubles which were entirely due to the people of Northern Ireland!  Don't blame us Brits! We tried to make the best of a bad situation and hopefully now things are improved and NI can look forward to a peaceful and prosperous future!
YPeWt3o6aa	The fact that he brings the issue that he will not pressure you! should bring up a red flag.  You know the guy and non of us can tell you what to do, or tell you about him.  Open your eyes, and make sure he is the guy for you.  He could be the best guy on Earth.  Make sure he is the best for YOU.  Put aside the fact that you are not from the same religion, and test him to make sure that he means what he sees.  Test him to see if he will not try to change you, or force you to change.  If he is religious, test him to see how he will react if your kids are to be after your religion not his.  Talk to people who has gone through it.  People are not all the same.  He could be truth, or he could be just courting you.  You are before the honeymoon, after the honeymoon, things will change.  we all change one or another.  Make sure the change is not drastic, and he is true to his words, and will give you all that you need and want, that is respect and love.  Forever and ever.    Edit:  queenthesbian, this is for you dear.    Quote:  "He is a sweet guy, caring, and says that he won't pressure me to do anything I don't want".    HE says He won't pressure her to do anything she doesn't want.  HE, not her family.    Also, she asked about exploring the relationship.  It doesn't mean having sex.  Relationship is not just sex.  He sounds like a nice guy, and if he knows he well.  I'm sure he will not ask her to do anything against her well.  Legal Age!! I didn't know there is a legal age to tell your parents what you think.  Loveling or other wise.  Or for having sex.  There is a legal age to whom a person can have sex with, not just hers.  If they are both the same age over or under 18, that is where the legal age comes to play.      I am old enough not to be rude as you.  Read before you post dear, and it was not for you.    ksgirl07 ,  Good luck to you.|`|AA11673580	either one is a christian or not!  that's like saying someone is a little bit pregnant|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	I would say spend time with this person. Get to see how they are when they are around their family or friends. This is where someone's true character come out. In all pray about it. God will show you. Just be yourself. Afterall you want him to fall in love with the "real you" not someone whom he thinks you are. If he can't accept you as you are, or vice versa, dust off your feet and move on. Trust God as he knows best.|`|474611e5e9d3f09380293aff2c231fa7aa	I think you should talk to your parents my dear. You say your mother is putting pressure on you to find out where he stands. Surely the main rock on which true Christianity is built is love for your fellow man (and woman). Christs love was total, your mother should perhaps be prepared to show that same unselfish love to your young man regardless of his faith or even lack of it. I know many "Christians" who attend church regularly, but would not stop to help a drunk in the street. Many years ago a man who I had a great deal of respect for asked a beautiful question. If you were accused of being a Christian would there be enough evidence to convict you. Ask her to give him a chance, he sounds like a nice guy. Good luck and God bless you both.|`|g5cn9AU1aa	Not to Liv E, the guy did not bring the issue, her family did.       I don't know how old you are, so that it makes it tough to answer the qeustion.        If you are of legal age, my advice would be to lovingly tell you family that you appreciate their concern, but that this is YOUR decision, and that you want to explore this relationship on YOUR terms, and make the decisions on YOUR terms.       I would avoid getting into it with them over the fact that you don't know where YOU stand in regards to belief in God.  They will try to blame THAT on his influence.     It sounds like you are good, decent person, and if this guy will honor your decision to wait until marriage to have sex, then he sounds like a real gem.      Good luck !|`|yEm4YVhZaa	Good, honest, heartfelt open communication is all that's needed. Easier said than done....If you talk and I mean really share openly all that is on your mind, with your family and your boyfriend and don't skirt the issues you will get all the information you need. Most people really don't know how to communicate well. You must learn to be direct and ask the right quetions. Poor communication is at the core of all human relationship problems and misunderstandings. As far as figuring out your own standing with God, I suggest you take up journaling. Writing out your thoughts and feelings on a daily basis is an excellent way to gain clarity.|`|AA11586837	You'll Have to Talk to GOD on That One!|`|4c979acd3ee945a6e63181337a60c6e7aa	Wow ... just to let you know, there are people who never attend church or worship the Lord who have high morals and standards.  Just because your mom regrets her marriage she shouldn't base your decision on whether or not your boyfriend is good enough for you by this.
OZ2Ass9iaa	I think of it as "Super Happy Funland."  Like Disneyworld on acid.  I don't think it's real, but that's how I like to think of it.|`|3qqvFEsHaa	eternity does not seem like a good thing    I highly highly doubt after someone has lived for 10 billions years that they would feel like living for another 500 billion|`|v7Wflu78aa	I used to think that.    But, it's more useful to work with the actual figures: billions of years compared with the seventy to hundred years that I will live.    I think it's more useful to think of the scale of time in more realistic terms than to make up a fictional analogy.    Sorry to rain on your parade - I used to think the way you do too, but now that I have learned about the history of the universe, the future of our sun, the history of the earth, and so on, I think in terms of actual events.
AA11550238	Just as there is a standard Process of inviting God or Demigod to kindly stay within the deity (called Prana Pratishtha) so that we can render service and prayer to him.   Similarly if the deity gets Old or Broken, there is a Standard process of asking God or Demigod to kindly leave deity and enter another new Deity so that the worship and service can be performed properly. When the personality leaves the deity then there is a proper way in which the elements with which the Deity is made, can go back into its origin. And that is Called Wisarjana.     But currently people have taken up a Fanatic Concocted Practice.   When a particular festival comes they make Big Big Deities and Worship them for few days, and after that Dump the new Deity into water.   This is a Great Insult to the Demigod like Durga or Ganesh or Saraswati. Vedic Literatures does not allow this...  If you want to invite Supreme God Krishna or Demigods like Ganesh or Durga for serving and worshiping, then you must construct a Proper Temple or place and worship it regularly. Why do you dump new deities into water??   But the Rascals will do that...   They only care for Collecting lot of Money, Making a lot of Noise and Show off and Thus enjoying themself in the name of Spritual or Pious Activity... They Get lot of Money, and now they put Film Songs and engage in illicit Sex, and they drink wine and Gamble and do all kinds of sinful activity..   This is the way these Rascals degrade Vedic Culture..|`|AA10008661	Ganesh, Durga are seen not as a physical entity but a higher spiritual being, and murtis, or statue-representations, act as signifiers of him as an ideal. Thus, to refer to the murtis as idols betrays Western Judeo-Christian understandings of insubstantial object worship whereas in India, Hindu deities are seen to be accessed through points of symbolic focus known as murtis. For this reason, after sacred days the immersion of the murtis of Ganesh (and Durga) in nearby holy rivers is undertaken since the murtis are acknowledged to be only temporal understandings of a higher being as opposed to being 'idols,' which have traditionally been seen as objects worshipped for their own sake as divine.

She threatened passing ships and in the Odyssey ate six of Odysseus' companions.   Scylla was a nymph, daughter of Phorcys. The fisherman-turned-sea-god Glaucus fell madly in love with her, but she fled from him onto the land where he could not follow. Despair filled his heart. He went to the sorceress Circe to ask for a love potion to melt Scylla's heart. As he told his tale of love to Circe, she herself fell in love with him. She wooed him with her sweetest words and looks, but the sea-god would have none of her. Circe was furiously angry, but with Scylla and not with Glaucus. She prepared a vial of very powerful poison and poured it in the pool where Scylla bathed. As soon as the nymph entered the water she was transformed into a frightful monster with twelve feet and six heads, each with three rows of teeth. Below the waist her body was made up of hideous monsters, like dogs, who barked unceasingly. She stood there in utter misery, unable to move, loathing and destroying everything that came into her reach, a peril to all sailors who passed near her. Whenever a ship passed, each of her heads would seize one of the crew.|`|9db8639af613ad7b9ec2e7ef8fc930dbaa	They eat fishermen|`|f45a984d1329f2a7e1c849121b772355aa	yeah, she was this monster from the odyssey. she had like 6 heads, a lot of teeth and a lot of legs. she ate 6 men from every ship that sailed by her.

It is the moral responsibility and ethical duty of rational people to protect vulnerable minds from being contaminated by Bronze Age myths and willful ignorance. Beyond that, Christianity represents a huge threat to the well-being and survival of our country and to the whole world... and so it must be confronted.    http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/...  http://www.yuricareport.com/Dominionism/...    I prefer the term 'Rationalist', or 'Free Thinker', as opposed to 'atheist', or 'unbeliever', since those terms capture more of the people who think that religious beliefs are stupid and irrelevant than the term 'atheist' does. Those terms capture the main reason that people BECOME Atheists... i.e., they have learned how to THINK properly. Once someone learns how to think properly, religious belief is one of the first casualties. Religious belief... particularly the Abrahamic death cults of desert monotheism (Judaism, Christianity, Islam)... simply cannot withstand the glaring light of reason and critical thought. It just evaporates. Poof. The fact that Christians assert and promote such ridiculous beliefs is a clear indication that they CAN'T (or WON'T) think properly.    Rational people recognize that some people who visit this forum are truly, sincerely seeking answers... with an open mind (willing to honestly consider alternative possibilities), and with intellectual honesty (willingness to freely question and doubt their own presumptions). That being the case, it is the MORAL OBLIGATION of rational people to HELP them keep their minds open, and to make them aware of some of those alternative possibilities. Inevitably, those alternative possibilities DO NOT include things like a terrarium earth, talking snakes and donkeys, demons, friendly spirits, evil spirits, walking on water, multiplying loaves and fishes, people raising from the dead, stopping the sun in its tracks, parting seas, people being bodily sucked up into heaven (which, by the way, lies on the other side of the sky), world-wide floods, creating people from dust bunnies and ribs, magical trees of knowledge, gods speaking from burning bushes... and ritual cannibalism by eating god in the form of a cracker.    ******************  "A thorough reading and understanding of the Bible is the surest path to atheism ~ Donald Morgan  ******************    So, when someone comes along in a PUBLIC FORUM, regurgitating dogmatic slogans, and the myths, superstitions, fairy tales and fantastical delusions of an ignorant bunch of Bronze Age fishermen and wandering goat herders, and declaring them to represent some kind of cosmic 'TRUTH' (without the least bit of credible evidence)... well, by golly, that just HAS TO BE confronted.    All faith-based religious belief is fully deserving of all the scorn and ridicule that can be heaped upon it. It is a simple matter of people with rational minds having a moral obligation to stand in opposition to willful ignorance. It is quite necessary that this be done, if we are to have any hope that the human race will survive and evolve to meet its full potential. So, when these myths, superstitions, fairy tales and fantastical delusions are presented and declared to 'TRUTH', in the venue of a PUBLIC FORUM, a confrontation is inevitable.     ***********  "I am treated as evil by people who claim that they are being oppressed because they are not allowed to force me to practice what they do."? ~ D. Dale Gulledge  ***********    In order to have a rational view of the universe, it is necessary that one possess the mental faculties that facilitate reason, logic and critical thought. The things that are entailed by Christian beliefs demonstrate, beyond any doubt, a lack of those capabilities. Christians do serve a useful purpose on this earth... as a classic 'bad example'. They obligingly provide assertions about impossible happenings and circumstances, and magical delusions, and glaring misconceptions about science and nature and the universe... which can then be rationally confronted and exposed, and their preposterousness revealed.     ********************  "The god who is reputed to have created fleas to keep dogs from moping over their situation must also have created fundamentalists to keep rationalists from getting flabby.? Let us be duly thankful for our blessings."? ~ Garrett Hardin  ********************    Again... rational people are not trying to convert Christians... we are trying to protect people FROM Christians, and the insidious mind killing delusions and willful ignorance which they seek to spread, as if they were some kind of organized, dogmatic insanity virus.     However, rational people DO respect everyone's right, in the privacy of their own minds, to delude themselves in whatever fashion they deem fit.     Science, logic, reason, and critical thought have long been regarded (by religious people) as the enemies of religion. Considering that those are the tools of highly intelligent people, it should not come as a huge shock to learn that intelligence (or lack of it) has some connection to religious belief. In fact, there are about 40 studies, conducted over a period of 80 years or so, that reveal a statistically significant NEGATIVE CORRELATION between intelligence and religiosity. In plainer language, that means that they found that the more intelligent a person is, the LESS likely that person is to be religious.    If you think about it, those findings make a lot of sense. Intelligence tests mainly provide an indication of reasoning ability and problem solving ability... logic, reason and critical thoug|`|AA11317725	They have no excuse not to believe.

You are part of a much larger group.  If you look at if from a historical viewpoint, religions have an extremely bloody, violent past, and present.    I know you mean it when you say you don't mean to harm anyone.  But, the harm happens, nonetheless.  If you ascribe to the beliefs, you must also accept some responsibilty for the way those beliefs affect the world you live in.    Christianity, Judaism, and Islam were all born in the Middle East.  Religious wars have raged back and forth across those lands for millenia.  That unrest spread to every other continent on the globe, and is in large part to blame for the violence we are seeing today.    I don't hate you, or even think that you have no right to believe what you do.  I think you're kidding yourself if you think your hands are clean.  The blind refusal on the part of religious followers to see the damage being done, or to accept any responsiblity for the mess we're in, is what makes me see red.     Religion is by its very nature divisive.  I know you don't intend to be so, and that your intentions are good, but...remember what the road to hell is paved with?

Look at the article at the bottom of my page...  http://planttel.net/~meharris1/mikescorn...|`|AA11382947	A partial education in Christianity is a dangerous thing.    It can lead people to change to Islam with only a partial understanding of it.    Study Islam for yourself, objectively, Study the life of Muhammad, what kind of example was he?  Study the lives of women in Islam, Study Shira Law.    You will be shocked, I was.    That being said, there are many peaceful Muslims, but the radicals do have the guns and are not afraid to use them.    I do respect their right to believe as they wish, as long as they don't infringe on my rights to do the same.  You cannot Preach Christianity in Muslim countries without fear of Death.    It just gets really old to keep hearing Muslim posters go on and on about how peaceful and perfect Islam is when you don't have to look very hard to see that is not true in many cases.    Google Islam in Iran, Google Islam in Sudan. Learn for yourself.    Many are being misled away from Jesus.    God Bless you!    Peace!|`|f9f61fdf35dd923baac231c0fa0af3e6aa	In the Qurran it says: God says all christians and jew are hated by God and they are preverse, if any muslum is even friend with them they are one of them. My God loves all his children. The Islamic religion also does not believe Jesus died on the cross, nor do they believe in the resurection. I believe Jesus gave his life on the cross for all of us. Therefore, the god of Islam, I believe, is not the same God the Christians love and worship.|`|15a9cf3049fdbe9bcd21f7a3eb2b93d1aa	it shows the people in this world is unfair..|`|c42709807d173d75e945323545caf4baaa	MUSLIM CONFLICTS AROUND THE WORLD    Current conflicts and wars: Source: http:/www.religioustolerance.o...

AA10315921	Please don't listen to Ms. Genuine's ignorant answer.  Clearly, she has her head in her ---.  There is definitely not anything wrong with you and it is okay to have any sexual preference you want.  It is not wrong, nor is it gross.    In time, your heart will tell you the right thing for you to do.  If at one time you're attracted to a man so be it.  Maybe, you haven't met the right one yet.  If you're attracted to a woman, same thing applies.    The point is that you should not feel ashamed or that there is something wrong with you because there absolutely is not!!!|`|0b01def1aca2a67c87027926c8f0f55daa	First of all, sweetie, you're not gross!  You're beautifully human and you're going through a tough time right now.  It's not easy to come to terms with your sexuality(hell, we've all been there, including yours truly!). Work on loving yourself and telling your family and friends about you.  If they accept it, great!  If not, then at least you have the courage to press on.  Embrace it and love YOU for YOU!  Good luck, boo.    By the way, MsGenuine, it wouldn't hurt for you to use the spell check feature next time.

As far as your sexual preference it is what it is. Don't change unless that's what you want to it would be a waste to wake up one day and say that your not happy because your gay or straight. .|`|8e49a98c498ee2731e51d713bb9145adaa	You're 22 and you can't spell "gross"? That's pretty sad...  Anyway, being bisexual isn't anything to be ashamed about, nor is being straight or completely homosexual. It's just another one of those things that make us who we are, and in my opinion I think everybody should leave the homosexual issue alone, get along with everybody, and let God decide ALL of our fates. It's pointless that we're trying to ban same-sex marriage, since it's not our job to decide who goes to heaven and who goes to hell. You seem pretty unsure about your preference, though, so I think it would be best if you kept experimenting with having relationships with both males and females, and hopefully one day you can find where you are most  comfortable at. Another piece of my two-cents is to not try to force a relationship to continue or to even be started. Everything happens in due time, live a little and stop worrying about dating.|`|AA11592289	i should hope not because i certainly am
AA11647021	OK first off, are you talking about a hand gun or a long-gun?, because If your talking hand gun, they are Illegal to own within the city limits, Unless your involved with law enforcement.    secondly, If you looking to buy a long gun, well you should already have other questions of what it is your looking to buy, because for someone to ask about any old gun-shop in the city as there first question, that tells me you probably know very little about guns in general

AA10550142	Okay ashley, I'll try to help.    Firstly, you're at a very difficult age, and having special needs only makes that even harder.  Secondly, you're also having a lot of trouble with your family and friends, who could normally try to support you but right now that's not happening.  Third, you've had dreams or visions that you don't understand and it's causing you to doubt your abilities.    To begin, remember that everyone has at some time or another been a teenager.  Everyone has made some good choices and some bad, and most of the time, things get better.  Right now, the world is putting you under a lot of pressure, but soon you'll be in a position to deal with that pressure on your own terms.  Being a teen doesn't last forever- enjoy being young and free, and don't let the world get you down.    Secondly, your friends and family are causing you a huge ammount of stress!  It may be because they hate you- but more than likely that's NOT the reason.  They are probably just as confused about your identity as you are, and struggling to adapt to the positive and negative changes you make in your life as you become more adult.  Remember that your family will still be your family when you're 30, 40, 50.  Be yourself, they will eventually come around.    Now it seems to me that these stresses you're under, caused by the physical mental and social changes we experience in young adulthood, have made your hitherto subtle psychic gifts become more powerful and more confusing.  I know that you have had dreams and visions that you cannot make sense of because they are impossible.  You also mentioned that the closer someone is to you, the more you're apt to know about their future.  Your pre-cognitive abilities are empahetic- as is often the case.  Remember that lots of people have occasional episodes of psychic premonition.  If your gift is one that has been with you for a long time, then it is up to you to responsibly gauge which visions should be acted upon, and which may be illusion.  Remember that even people with perfect eyesight still see things that aren't there- just like every psychic sometimes has a vision that does not come true.  Don't let it get to you.    It is my belief that your headaches are caused not by the abilities you possess, but by the difficult time you're having in coping with them.  Stress is probably the culprit.  There are a lot of web sites with great advice for dealing with stress, and a good program is listed below.    In the mean time, when the stress is out of the way, you'll find it's much easier to control your own empathic abilities.  How can you make sense of someone else's mind when your own mind is so shaken up?    Peace be with you,    CORE|`|29258f3f6c5bf7548bbab17bd203f719aa	It sounds to me like maybe you need to learn to block.

This may block all your powers but it depends on how deep you block it.    This is mental work. It worked for me. So well that I blocked myself completely for years. A bad move on my part and I've never been completely able to remove the block I created.    So.... do this....    It's going to take great concentration...    Concentrate and visualize gauze being slowly wrapped around your mind. Strip after strip, around and around. This gauze is slowly blocking your "vision" and it's slowly preventing anything from entering. Depending on how many strips you wrap around, you may completely block your "vision" and be unable to see.    Be very careful. You don't want to end up like I did.    It may take some thought at first to maintain that block but eventually it will become second nature.

AA10550142	If you keep looking for it, you'll keep finding it- just as the shadows move in the corner of your eye confirming that you are being watched, or as the floor creeks reminding you that you are not alone.  The human mind is in a constant state of re-organizing the data given to it, trying to make greater sense of simple things- like the time on a digital clock.  It's a trait that seems only natural for man as the smartest creature on this planet.    I am not a naysayer in matters spiritual, but I am a sceptic- particularly obvious self-deception sets off triggers in me like 11:11 does in some others.  The triggers tell me "We are biological.  Our brains are wrapped like onions.  Help these people understand."|`|AA12199134	I have been seeing this for awhile now.  I thought it was the angels contacting me.

FZM15NXtaa	Jehovah's Witnesses endeavor to follow the preaching example of the Lord Jesus Christ, who did not take up collections.  Jesus did, however, accept the free-will gifts of others, including meals and lodging, and perhaps the costly seamless garment he had before being put to death.    In the book of Acts, the earliest history of the Christian congregation, people were encouraged to give what they could to support the Christian ministry.     In like manner, there are Contribution boxes in Kingdom Halls, for people to give what they can, when they can, and if they can.  There is no mandatory donation, no set amount or any set times as to what or when people can contribute.    shalei's comments about being brainwashed into donating property or money are absolutely false.  The bitter intent of such comments is obviously to mislead.  I have been one of Jehovah's Witnesses for 50 years and no one has brainwashed me into doing anything.    It is easy to call any religion a cult and to allege brainwashing.  Those are ignorant comments.    Our goal is to help people to draw close to Jehovah God and to his Son, our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  In so doing we have the best interests of people at heart, eternally.|`|AA11611437	I have been studying with Jehovah Witnesses for over a year now. They are very sincere, dedicated people. The couple I meet with are truly christian in attitude.   However, they do not teach true doctrine. They do not believe that Jesus is God, and they do not believe that all must be born again, as Jesus very firmly declared.  The Watchtower Organization was formed on false precepts.  They claim to be God's prophet. The Bible says that the sign of a true prophet is whether or not what they prophesy comes to pass or not.  The Watchtower has prophesied some extremely outlandish events that did not come to pass at the time they proclaimed (or any time thereafter). Therefore, they have to be a false organization.  I do not fault Jehovah's Witnesses any more than other denominational christians. They are simply being deceived by the leaders of their respective organizations.|`|6055f289dbcdd061906c9ecf5889049daa	I've been one of Jehovah's Witnesses for 10 years. Our main goal is to teach people about the Bible. We are dedicated students of the Bible and we wish to share Bible truths with others. We willingly go out and knock on your doors. We use our own time, money and gas. We receive nothing back except the joy of knowing that we are trying to help people come to an accurate knowledge of Bible truth.

It has to be in their Will.  Then they let the members die free will by brainwashing them not to seek professionals who can help them or cure their disease.  The leaders also tell them that not even God can cure them.  They have to wait for the resurrection.  Those people are brainwashed cults and my advice to you is STAY AWAY from them.  Seek God and Christ first before all other things.|`|AA12275506	Matt. 10:8: "You received free, give free." 18 Matthew 10:8-10 describes the attitude of those sharing in the preaching work. Gods Kingdom has to take first place in their life, physical needs are secondary. Why? Jesus says: For the worker deserves his food. Our heavenly Father will always take care of those who put their trust in him.    What Queenwegu said below is just plain wrong. Since tithing is not a Christian requirememt, we do not give a percentage of our income to the organization. We each individually give whatever we want. No one know knows what we give except Jehovah.    Many responders to your question have plenty of lies to say about us, but we know better. We have no paid clergy to do the preaching work for us. Our time is given free to all those who want to know the truth about the Bible.|`|ejZeAp4gaa	They believe that is how they get to heaven so it really is all about them.|`|a20537f9e60f7882d8fd2800775d174caa	First I believe one person was right when they said the members of this sect give a portion of their income.    Second, those who say preachers and other ministers should not get paid deny the scriptures.  The Bible teaches that those who spend their lives teaching the word should be supported by the other believers.    I wonder how many of you who hold secular employment will work for no wages.  What do you think you would pay your expenses with or buy your needs with.  For those who think a minister should hold a job and be a minister full time - would you do it?      Ministers who are deadly serious about serving God need their time to pray, search their Bibles, and do visitations to jails and hospitals and on and on and on their responsibilities go.  Some ministers get very little rest as their people call them for anything and everything day and night without caring whether they rest or not.    Get a grip!  There is not one honest person here who will say they will work for nothing 24/7 like these people do.  Most ministers salaries are a joke at best because they are expected to work like a machine on slave wages.    THE PERSON WHO GAVE ME A THUMBS DOWN HAS NEVER SEEN A TRUE MINISTER OF THE GOSPEL WHO WORKS MANY TIMES LONG AND EXHAUSTING HOURS WITHOUT A WORD OF THANKS FROM SO-CALLED CHRISTIANS WHO WOULD NOT LIFT A FINGER TO HELP THEM.|`|c04c66fe2f7520a305d4676ca06e8647aa	The Jehovah's Witnesses take seriously Jesus' command to preach.    "Go therefore and make disciples of people of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy spirit." -- Matthew 28:19    "While I did not hold back from telling YOU any of the things that were profitable nor from teaching YOU publicly and from house to house." -- Acts 20:20      By observing the command to preach, they show Jehovah that we love him.    "I do nothing of my own initiative; but just as the Father taught me I speak these things." -- John 8:28    They also preach because they want to counteract the lies that Satan is promoting against him.  As Jehovahs Witnesses, they yearn to share in exposing Satans slanders and in sanctifying Gods name before mankind.    "The god of this system of things has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, that the illumination of the glorious good news about the Christ, who is the image of God, might not shine through." -- 2 Corinthians 4:4    "YOU are my witnesses, is the utterance of Jehovah, even my servant whom I have chosen, in order that YOU may know and have faith in me, and that YOU may understand that I am the same One. Before me there was no God formed, and after me there continued to be none. I am Jehovah, and besides me there is no savior.   I myself have told forth and have saved and have caused [it] to be heard, when there was among YOU no strange [god]. So YOU are my witnesses, is the utterance of Jehovah, and I am God." -- Isaiah 43:10-12      The apostole Paul showed how important is to preach the good news.    "If, now, I am declaring the good news, it is no reason for me to boast,for necessity is laid upon me. Really, woe is me if I did not declare the good news!" -- 1 Corinthians 9:16      For more information go to:  http://www.watchtower.org/e/jt/index.htm...  http://www.watchtower.org/library/pr/art...  http://www.watchtower.org/library/w/2002...|`|AA11767734	I am one of Jehovah's Witnesses.

Each of us donates to the worldwide preaching effort whatever our hearts move us to.  This includes our time in the ministry and financial contrubutions. All of this is motivated by love; Love for Jehovah and his son Jesus and love for our neighbors.

The Human anatomy favors vegetarianism:     1) We have molar teeth to masticate food, to chew; we do not have canines to rip flesh as carnivores do.  2) Our saliva contains Alpha-Amylase, an enzyme that digests plant foods, which is not found in the saliva of carnivores.  3) Meats putrefy much faster than vegetables; so carnivores have intestines that are only 3 times body length. Herbivores have 10 to 12 times body length, as do humans.  4) The concentration of the stomach acids of carnivores is 20 times that of herbivores and humans, it takes less acid to digest vegetables and fruits.  5) We do not have claws to tear and rip flesh, our hands with the opposing thumb is more suited for harvesting fruits and vegetables.  6) Carnivores have a great capacity to rid themselves of cholesterol. Humans do not.  7) Carnivores lap up water and pant to get rid of body heat. Humans sip water and perspire through skin pores.     Vegetables and fruits are rich in fiber and nutrients, but instead of eating them we feed them to the animals and then instead ingest fats and cholesterol from the animals. Where is the logic?     Health Reasons:     As early as 1961, The AMA journal stated that 90+% of heart disease can be prevented with a Vegetarian diet.  There is a strong link between colon cancer and meat eating ( 3 above). Toxins in meat, do damage because they are not expelled as quickly they would be in carnivores.     Dioxin, one of the deadliest toxins, is concentrated in meat at levels 22 times what are safe, according to the EPA. More than 95% of all dioxin exposure comes in meat, dairy, and eggs. None comes in vegan foods (the other 5% is environmental).     Factory farming has made meat eating more dangerous. Because the animals are given tranquilizers, hormones and antibiotics, the latter often up to 30 times higher than humans consume in a lifetime. Preservatives in meat are dangerous to human health too.     Diseases in the meat itself go unchecked. There are not enough Meat Inspectors and& their checks are cursory. If ever there are recalls- , most of the tainted meat has already been consumed and& the damage done. Cows with eye cancer and& abscessed liver are processed. ( 19 million pounds of beef were recalled July 02).     Rodent droppings are ignored. Meat packing would come to a halt if the laws were strictly enforced.     What about protein? How does the rhino, the elephant and the bull survive? Inadequacy of protein in a vegetarian diet is a complete myth propagated by vested interests. In fact, over- ingestion of protein in the Western diet has been detrimental to health. Grains, beans, sprouts, nuts are all concentrated sources of protein. Cheese, peanuts and lentils contain more protein per ounce than hamburger, pork or steak.!     The Mad cow disease is really  The Man Greed Disease Cows were fed animal matter --remains of other animals. --put in their feed to save money. Being herbivorous, cows have 4 stomachs, and animal matter putrefies in their system and caused the disease.     Ecological Reasons:     We are hooked on a meat-centered diet because of the illusion of cheap grain. Over 70% of grain in USA is fed to livestock. This is most inefficient it takes sixteen pounds of grain yield to yield 1 pound of beef. Six pounds of grain produce 1 pound of pork and 3 pounds of grain to produce 1 pound of chicken.     The South American rain forests are being decimated by conversion to grazing lands, ruining the lungs of mother earth- that convert the carbon- di-oxide in the air back to oxygen.     If the whole world were vegetarian there is enough grain to feed 11 billion people. The current population is 6 billion.     The meat and dairy industry is effectively exempted from the US Clean Air & Water Act. The amount of toxic waste by this industry alone is 1 billion tons per year which is about 60-80% of the total toxic waste.     The total cattle herd in the world is 1.3 billion head; total weight of the animals exceeds the weight of humans on earth.  There is no practical way to dispose of the chicken manure, so cattle farmers mix it with Soya and feed it to the cattle- 500 tons per year!     Global warming would be reduced considerably if meat consumption were reduced. The contribution to global warming by automobiles is insignificant compared to the use of energy for feedstock.     Conclusion:     This David and Goliath battle cannot be won on financial grounds. The Food Industry contributed 41 million dollars to the House & Senate, no Senator or House of Representative would dare oppose them. The Farm bill puts billions of dollars every year for the next 10 years into the coffers of the Meat and Dairy Industry.

Thousands of Americans die each year -- and millions more become sick -- from the food they eat and the number of disease-producing agents in the nations food supply.

Government officials at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention have described the current food situation as epidemic.

Yes because she needs to know that keeping the doors unlocked is very unsafe.  Even if your home you should keep your doors locked.  She should gone to make a copy of the key instead of putting both of you and your valuables at risk.    No because being locked out can be unsafe as well.  You probably should have sat her down and explained the situation to her instead of just locking her out.  Or you could have gone and gotten a copy of the key made yourself, they're relatively cheap.

TasLY97jaa	I suspect the problem lies more with you than the "women" you are referring to.  You must first make a point for someone to get your point.  If what you've presented here is a good example of you making  and supporting a point, then its not hard to fathom how these ladies aren't seeing it the same way.  You've not done a good job backing up your insinuation.  If anything, you've proven more that you have a problem understanding the difference between "understanding" and "agreeing."  Just cause a lady doesn't agree with ya doesn't mean she doesn't understand ya.      Or maybe you just subconsciously or consciously enjoy drama and conflict and therefore surround yourself with defensive and argumentative females.  Perhaps this enjoyment also leads you to vocalize assumptions in a nasty and argumentative manner that encourages others to react similarly defensive and matter-of-fact.  That's a sign you need to look at and understand yourself - not that women can't grasp the concept of generalizations.  |`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	I would have to disagree that this a problem in any way unique to women.  It's been my experience that people of either sex rarely understand either the principle or purpose of generalization.  Having established a basis for a generalization it is necessary to then employ verification to determine if it applies in any specific case.  Failing that you have over-generalization which tends to lead to deductive errors.  If you present your generalization as applying to all members of a defined class without exception, then a single exception does, in fact, refute your position.  Since it an extremely common logical flaw to think in terms only of extremes, black or white, no shades of gray, people will automatically not think in terms of tendencies or in very common but non-universal characteristics, which are the basis of generalization in formal reasoning, but assume that you mean that no exceptions can possibly exist.  Given that, it is on you, the speaker, to phrase your generalization with sufficient specificity to avoid the misunderstanding.  If you can't do that it's your own fault not theirs if they don't understand what you mean.|`|8436981597659ae2a44f3a6c63d4a5c7aa	Why do you not understand that if people (male or female) can cite valid exceptions to your generalisation, it's a weakened or destroyed argument?    Dangerous things, generalisations, exactly because they are so often easily invalidated.    Don't blame females for your being out-played in debate.|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	women are not big fans of generalization. we are all detail and specifics, that could be why we jump quickly.|`|f4doqdSCaa	Well, generally I'm not a fan of generalization, but I'd say you have a bit of a point. Of course, generally men generalize about women's generalizations out of frustration. ;-)|`|eb71d539c6860290e80bdaa4253a2f87aa	Yeah, I guess you have to have a little noodle between your legs to be able to understand generalization.    Thank you for making me aware of this very difficult concept, Noodleboy.|`|LolctYwBaa	You hate women...and they're not fond of you. I'm generalizing...|`|TrsfrdMcaa	it's because throughout history, women have continually been stereotyped and 'pushed' into a certain generalization, that now most dislike it. For example, last century the government said, "'everyone' is allowed to vote"; and then put women in the long list of people who weren't allowed to vote in tiny script down the bottom.    So yeah, we do understand it... |`|YbSsCVRRaa	suggest that they should understand without pain. work for it.|`|AA10260790	I've asked many questions on YA about whether one can generalize anything about women.  The one thing that women in general seem to agree on is that they all like to be held.  I haven't met a woman yet who says they don't like to be held.  So, the next time your wife wants to be held, say to her "why do you want to be held?".  If she tells you that this is a stupid question, because all women want to be held, then just say "isn't that a generalization"?|`|h4aLaE0uaa	Why generalize? The fact that women get upset when you generalize does NOT mean that they don't understand the concept. It means that they don't like stereotypes, and therefore are trying to demonstrate to you that generalizing people is stupid because there are ALWAYS exceptions.

6DZsZbjFaa	Well, since you're aware of the fact that you can be so harsh on people, it's a good thing. That way, you can make an honest attempt at making a change. First off, i don't get bad PMS, i don't really think i get PMS at all lol, (i'm a naturally happy & optimistic person), but i know what your talking about. So as soon as you know that your going to have a bit of a verbal slaying, think of the fact that Allah is merciful, however you can't consciously do something, then repent, then do it again & then repent. It doesn't work like that. I'm sure your aware that the purpose of our being here is part of the great test? (to prove ourselves worthy of entry to janna/heaven), so take on one of the core ideologies of islam, which is peace unto ourselves & others. (Something i'm sure someone here is bound to dispute. lol) & remember that you're the only one that can alter what you do or don't do, so never brush it off as something you can't control. If we don't challenge ourselves or even try, we'll never do anything, or anything great at the least. & one last thing, while it's normal to have your "bad mood" days, the worst thing you could do is take it out on your own mother. Allow me to place some emphasis onto that---the WORST!!! never, ever, ever, ever, ever, EVER, forget the value of your parents, especially your mother. & especially when it comes to pleasing Allah (having ridda/contentedness from your mother, can equate ridda from Allah himself & hence can be your ticket to prosperity in the dinya/present life & mercy in the akhirra/judgement day & the hereafter.) Always think before you act. Good luck.  & Blueberry, i love what you said in your answer, "he is not a mean God/Allah" lol i couldn't help finding the way you phrased that to be really cute! : )|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	Fist of all, Allah is not going to condemn you for "talking mean to someone". On the other hand if you are conscious of it, it is wrong for you to continue your behaviour. Weather you are pms'ing or not, if you know you are hurting someones feelings, its up to you to stop. you cant do what you want and ask forgiveness later.

The first one you have to suffer through, though eating as healthy as possible should help some. The second one, though, is the real problem. There are things you are angry about, maybe a lot of things, and you need to be able to identify what those are in order to address them. My deepest empathy, because sometimes what you are so angry about cannot be removed so quickly. |`|W6vxXjWvaa	Hey don't be so hard on yourself. We are human and have to keep trying to better ourselves. I believe that God/Allah will forgive you, he is not a mean God/Allah.    Before our cycle, our hormones are going up and down, so it is 'normal' to have mood swings, feel down, angry etc. I used to be like this but what i have been doing for the past year is this: I have been praying to God/Allah & asking Him to help me with this issue. Also you will know approximately when you will get your cycle, so therefore, pray strongly a week before hand & up until you get your cycle. God/Allah hears our prayers, just trust him.    Also, try and relax more the week before your cycle, don't pack too much into your week so that you aren't stressed etc. Drink camomile to calm you down and maybe look for healthy things that are known to calm you down for example lavender is very good de-stressing herb. The point i'm trying to make is you need to relax the week before and be nice to yourself.

Pity party time is way over.

However, I would  like  to ask this  guy what does he think of  himself because the most  important thing  is his  own opinion. It is maybe life's circumstances that brought him there, but he is the only ones  who knows.     IN some  countries like  in Italy, it is  normal  for  an adult  to  live  at their  parent's  house.|`|1pBxzfYfaa	He sounds like a friend of mine. But then his mum remarried and he had to move into a boarding house.     My friend isn't the coolest-looking guy and his lifestyle might not appeal to most women, but he is loyal, patient, and witty. I also deduce he is a virgin, by virtue of having no experience with girls at all, I mean I don't think he has even kissed somebody, and he's 29. I have another friend who is a very different person but was also at home living with his parents at a later age while unemployed.     Once you have been unemployed for a while, and perhaps otherwise (see current economic climate) it can indeed be extremely hard to pick up work. But it is also probable that he has some issues with working, either because of the limited range of work available to him or for psychological reasons (eg shyness, bad experiences at work previously).    I think his situation doesn't sound good on the surface, but in reality it might not be that bad. (Although he definitely needs to learn basic skills of cooking and laundry, and apparently his parents won't teach him or expect him to learn. He will be fcuked, therefore, once they die as he won't be able to boil an egg.) Like maybe he and his parents share a good relationship, maybe he's actually quite good at playing games.     If this guy isn't you, and is someone that you know, the best thing would be any initiative that gets him out of the house somewhere he can meet people, preferably with similar interests (eg universities sometimes have electronic games clubs that may accept members who aren't from unis, and may actually be able to look past his exterior). Ideally a girl with similar interests. He probably has a female double lurking in the suburbs pondering her doubtful fate and wishing someone would find her. They need to find each other, learn how to boil an egg and then get some crappy job that pays okay that involves computers in some way.     I am actually quite serious.    The other thing to watch out for is just like personal hygiene standards. In that kind of a situation people can really just let themselves go. Shyness can't be helped, but one can always try to be clean-shaven, smell good, have fresh breath etc etc.     I think at the end of the day we can't determine someone's worth by the job that they do or the position in society that they hold, so to really tell you what I would think of him, I'd have to meet him. But yeah, even in that situation and without an obvious way to transcend it, some improvements could be made that might offer him some chance of a future relationship that might last beyond the one that he shares with his parents.     If it's you, don't be too hard on yourself - just start to push the envelope a little and make some initiatives that might be a bit out of your comfort zone, yet bearable. Bit by bit. Try striking up a conversation even if you feel like the ground might swallow you up. Go for a job interview even if it feels like an anvil falling on your head. Encourage yourself. Status isn't everything; whether you're a good person or not is.    If it's someone you know, try to help them make some initiatives. Maybe go shopping for some clothes or some men's fragrance sometime, or go to some gaming/pop culture conference together, anything to get them out of the house and anything to sort of remind them that they are an adult and they could have a relationship.    I'm sure that even though he's very shy, there's some nice things about him.

BF31Es6daa	I totally agree... I mean, we live in a world where everyone is equal, and homossexuality it's a condition, not an option.    A gay person is not less than me or you or anybody else! We are all the same, we should have the same rights!    I wonder, what kind of world is this we live in, where a person can't marry the one he/she loves just because it's not "socially correct"...    Prejudices against gay people are just as wrong as prejudices against black people or foreign people. And that's wrong...!    We live in a new world... in a global world... we should have all already learned to deal with difference... Prejudices are just WRONG!    Gays are people too... and must have the same rights as everyone one of us...! I know this is the most basic and clich thing to say... but it's the truth that a lot of people seem to have missed.    What's going on in this world, where a human being is taken away one of his most basic rights... the right to get married with the person he loves...    A black man is in the White House for God sake... that mean a very positive avance... let's give rights to the homossexuals!!!    Move on with yoour mentality people!!|`|eGvyFeW9aa	I support gay marriage.     This is not only because I'm gay, but because it could have only positive impacts on the Earth. More children would be adopted, and we could always use more of that. Although, society fears that homosexuals raising children is a threat to their 'offspring', when this isn't necessarily true. The children that grow up with gay parents won't always turn out gay like their parents, they could be heterosexual (think about it like this, do married heterosexual couples with children ALWAYS have children that are straight? No! Look at me, for example. My parents are straight, and I'm not.).    Religion is also a huge thing, but God can forgive homosexuality, can he not? Personally, I'm agnostic, but when I was a Christian, I wondered why God wouldn't change me to be a heterosexual. It didn't happen, so I began to doubt his existence. Churches against heterosexual marriages must feel obligated to marry a gay couple if they're so scared. They can easily say no if they don't want to. Why should religion take part in our laws when there are so many different beliefs?    It's unconstitutional for our government to ban gay marriage, especially since it's a form of discrimination in the minority.

In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com|`|X8LNbaKQaa	You could download the text of a book of the Bible at a time and reformat it as you choose and print it.

I believe He has always tried to warn us about the way things are going to be when the end times arrive.  Do I believe we are living in the end times?  How could I not.  We cannot begin to comprehend so many authors over such a period of time writing "coincidentally" those things which have come to pass and the things which are waiting to come to pass.  If you don't believe the word of God----look at the ONE WORLD ORDER and you will see the book of Revelation in its final days.  :-)  Thanks for asking.    Is God warning us?  More than warning us---He continues  to love us and draw us closer to Himself.    God Bless America|`|25Cu0kjFaa	*yawn*    You realize the first people to decide that the end times were coming real soon now lived shortly after the advent of Christianity, yes? *Every* generation has seen signs and portents that this was the proverbial it, that Jesus was coming, etc., etc.    Never happens.

ahS4TuSEaa	Amen means "certainly" or "verily".|`|ki0tOVUYaa	it is a judeo/christian chant developed from OM that is used at the end of prayers in a sung mass and elsewhere in christian spirituality. the meaning attributed to it is "yes" or "let it be so."

The Hebrew root word from which it is drawn (aman) means be faithful; be trustworthy.    In the Hebrew Scriptures the word is used as a solemn expression to obligate oneself legally to an oath or covenant and its consequences (Nu 5:22; De 27:15-26; Ne 5:13), also as a solemn expression to subscribe to an expressed prayer (1Ch 16:36), to an expression of praise (Ne 8:6), or to an expressed purpose (1Ki 1:36; Jer 11:5).     In the Christian Greek Scriptures the title Amen is applied to Christ Jesus as the faithful and true witness. (Re 3:14) Jesus made singular use of the expression in his preaching and teaching, using it very often to preface a statement of fact, a promise, or a prophecy, thereby emphasizing the absolute truthfulness and reliability of what he said. (Mt 5:18; 6:2, 5,?16; 24:34)|`|8PIiHCZaaa	AMEN is what we would call an acronym.

The "church" he attended for 20 some years bears no resemblence to Christianity, and does exhibit hatred toward white Americans.  There is no way Obama could have been a member of that church for that long without realizing that, and there is no way those beliefs could have mystically been removed from his mind and heart and soul in the short time since it was publicly released that he was a part of that racist mess.  He does have a good poker face, though....enough to get Americans to vote for him.  I've said all along that racism is racism, nomatter what race it comes from.  Racism against white people is equally wretched as racism that comes from white people. Neither should ever be tolerated---and here we've voted into the office of presidency a blatantly racist man---family.

The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23.

Generally, it has not much to do with this present life because we are not under the "blessing and cursing" rules of the Old Testament law.  This is God's "hands off" time for the human race as we learn our lesson of self rule.  You will find the unbelievers doing well and finding fortune and fame ( if they can) while at the same time believers will suffer and find heartache, the same as Christ did and promised the same for many of His followers, or viceversa.

But, that doesn't make what they believe correct. Religion doesn't teach that believers will have an easy life, but only that they will be rewarded. Ones reward may not come until the afterlife. As for the African kids, that reminds me of a statement I once read in an article. In an interview, Mother Teressa stated that early in her life she had a dream that she was in heaven and allowed to ask God anything she wanted. She asked him why do you allow people to suffer? Why don't you help them? Why don't you do what you can to ease their pain? She then replied that she was shocked at first by God's response, but after giving it some thought, she understood exactly what he meant.    God's response was, "Why don't you!"     God Bless!  +?+|`|qyoXSdPCaa	Just believing there is a God isnt going to get anyone into Heaven.  As you can see by the following verse the devils believe but that doesnt mean they will be in Heaven.    James 2:19  Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.  (KJV)    In John 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  (KJV)    Rom 10:8-13  8But what saith it? The word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth, and in thy heart: that is, the word of faith, which we preach;  9That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.  10For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.  11For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed.  12For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him.  13For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.  (KJV)    Mankind are the ones responsible for the tragidy in the world because of our sinful natures.  Don't blame God.  We are responsible because man doesn't want to follow Gods ways.|`|WhcPr1yraa	False. I'm agnostic and rarely even think about the concept of god and my life is excellent.|`|2e2f438d78517ad777fa3313fb112873aa	Lost is an ambiguous term. This simply means that it is used in many ways and often times can become confused during the use of such a word. An example could be "love". When I say I "love ice cream" I don't mean it in the same way if I were to say "I love God". Even though there may be similarities, it is not the same kind of love. Another may be "bark" which could mean the sound a dog makes or the outter layer of a tree.     The term "lost", in the religious sense you are using it, simply means to be without God (more precisley without his grace and mercy). Your question, then, could be restated like this: "If one is without God, then  is one without God?". Using the term "lost" is more rhetorically effective, though. Obviously, when someone says "If you don't have God, then you're lost" is tuatological (self-evidently true) since its like saying "If you don't have God, then you don't have God". Well, duh.     The important thing to understand is the implications of such a true statement, for without God we are doomed to misery in Hell for eternity according to Christianity. If God does exist, and we are without him, then obviously we are in trouble according to the Christian way of thinking.    The latter half of your question is a major problem in the philosophy of religion: the problem of evil. Most Christians will respond by simply stating that free will, in itself, is a good and for God to take that away is an evil. Since God will not do evil, He will not remove free will. However, nothing in the Christians scriptures state that wonderful, magestic things will occur if your believe in God. Actually it is quite the contrary. Christ said that those who believed in him would be hated and persecuted. For this reason many of the authors of the New Testament wrote to the early Christians about persecution and perseverance through it. Also, why must God do something when man also has the power to do this himself? Surely we could help them. Is this not also what God has asked of those who believe in Him? Love thy neighbor? Protect the weak?     What have you done to help?        By the way, you're very beautiful.|`|AA12181796	No, the way your life goes is down to luck, not religion.|`|73455c6a787c90036b88c6c36738f763aa	Dear Jordan,     Because God simply does not exist.

They work hard to provide shelters and necessities for them.      For the non-believers, they may say they have a happy life.  But in some area, whether its now or in the future, they aren't fully happy.  They can only achieve full happiness once they accept Christ into their lives.|`|AygQshkcaa	They're there for a purpose.

N9VN9bwfaa	Whether spiritually speaking or physically, I'd have to pick up the baby.  I'm very partial to babies.  I raised two to adulthood and I'd happily become a granny if my kiddoes were interested in becoming parents.  They're not so I'm not.  And I'm too old to be a mommy again, though.  So even though I'd pick up that baby, I'd have to find some other younger lady to be it's mommy -- regretfully.  Babies are sweet.  Interesting question.    My mother says she used to have a recurring dream about a baby crying that she wasn't able to pick up.  I think it was herself -- she had 6 real ones that she was always rushing around caring for.

All the emphasis is placed on the woman's freedom of choice--which is a good thing--but denies the humanity and the freedom of the foetus.    It stands to reason that "pro-choice" by logical extension really DOES mean the same as "pro-abortion."      It is a sad commentary on our society that we're more willing to deny the most basic rights to the most vulnerable.  Anything--anything at all--but take responsibility for our actions.|`|AA12181796	Forgive me, but you seem a little dense.    I do defend the option of abortion.

They are pro-choice because they do not want to require a person to have an abortion--nor do they want to forbid it.  Pro-abortion was the position of the government of China, where families that violated their one-child policy were pressured to abort.    The people calling themselves "pro-life" really should go back to anti-abortion, since most of them support some policies that are not really pro-life.  Pro-war, for example.  Or J. Kenneth Blackwell, who just ran for chair of the Republican Party, who sincerely is so anti-abortion that he wouldn't permit one to save the life of the woman--say, in cases of ectopic pregnancies.  (His wife is lucky not to have had one of those, eh?).|`|TKZAYJokaa	um and that "pro" your "in front of" is not in front of abortion, duh, but in front of choice.......they could choose not do you know....    but regardless if i like the choice they make i feel a women should be allowed to make her own choice. free will remember......|`|AA10579309	The motto for pro-choice people is: "safe, legal, and rare."

Nice company you folks keep.|`|mC4mnvGFaa	because they see the choices as black and white only, they cannot understand that there are shades of grey.  I support the right for abortions on demand,  because we understand that sometimes it is the only logical oprion, but we would never suggest it is the only option. Let me give you an example. I have afriend who was married for years to an abusive man. she finally worked up the courage to take her children and leave him enroling in college so she could make abetter life for her children. Unfortunately, he broke into her house and forced sex onto her and she bacame pregnant. Her only logical option was abortion since another child would end her college chances and put her onto the welfare role.  and if the a-hole found out she was pregnant again, she would never be rid of him. so, yes, I support abortion, because it realy is pro-life for the rest of the family|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	um, if pro-choice was pro-abortion, we would want all pregnancies to end in abortions. we don't. we want the woman to CHOOSE. hence, pro-choice. we are FOR the right to have a CHOICE. get it?|`|COFPXYvZaa	everyone's already explained it for me, but I'll reiterate it. pro-ABORTION is someone who supports the abortion of ALL babies (and therefore, not much choice). pro-CHOICE is someone who supports the person to make their own decision for themselves (and, in my opinion, this philosophy goes beyond abortion). simply, a woman should be able to choose what happens in her uterus. if she chooses to have the baby, good for her! if she chooses to abort it, too bad. but it isn't the government's job to infringe upon the personal lives of others. if you don't want an abortion or oppose it, fine. you don't have to get involved with it. stay away from planned parenthood clinics and ignore it. but don't infringe upon the lives of other people who don't share your beliefs (and especially those who aren't christian or religious. they aren't obliged to live their lives according to the bible), and also the lives of people you don't even know [a Christian pro-lifer in alaska (you know who) telling some random atheist woman in new york she can't have an abortion]. I wouldn't advise someone to have an abortion, but that doesn't mean a woman can't have the free will to choose herself.    the INDIVIDUAL person should be the one who has the choice, NOT the government. we don't need a government that promotes coercion.|`|t3W4h59haa	I used to like you.|`|nxbuPeoCaa	Don't talk to us about English, Kitteh.    Pro-choice means you allow women to choose, doesnt mean I want to see abortions happening at all.    "I may not agree with what you say, But I'll defend to the death your right to say it" - Voltaire on free speech, interchangable on choice    Free speech and choice are what make this world spin, time to realise that.|`|I1tfz8nVaa	So pro-choice means before or in front of choice. Somehow you got choice and abortion mixed up.|`|elAfZpqaaa	Well some people believe that you can be both because you can support the choice for others to make that decision but be against the idea yourself.|`|R8oS6LB3aa	It's called pro-choice because we support the right to choose. A woman doesn't have to have an abortion if she doesn't want to; she can choose to have the baby, and that's her choice, and she should be able to make it. Likewise, if a woman does want to have an abortion, she should be able to do that too.    The prefix "pro-" also means "defending or supporting" and that's the use we're using in the word "pro-choice." I don't think anybody calls themselves a "pro-abortionist"; that's yet another word made up by fundamentalists.    I'm pretty sure the only problem here is that you don't understand the word "pro-choice."|`|LqyOHY37aa	Pro choice and pro abortion are not the same thing.     I am completely for the woman's right to choose the options best for her.  I am not a big fan of abortion. In fact, I think abortion as a form of birth control is plain irresponsibility.     Stop lumping people together.    Besides, how hypocritical is a "pro lifer" killing abortion doctors?|`|APjnSYKuaa	Why do you think your opinion is more important than someone else's decision that you have no valid reason to be a part of?|`|02sr7hNOaa	Certainly someone doesn't understand the English language, the prefix "pro-" means in favour of. The prefix "pre-" means before.    So, what are you really trying to ask?|`|LhDM4axKaa	People who are pro-choice are for the right of women to choose whether or not to get an abortion, to choose what to do with their own body and lives. This doesn't mean they think that abortion is a good, positive form of birth control- it means that they think that although it's not the best choice, it should still be available as a last resort. I don't *like* abortion, but I still believe it should be legal and available. I am for the right to choose; I am not for women using this as a method of birth control *instead* of condoms, the pill, etc.    Oh, and I would chance to say that I do understand the English language perfectly well. Making rude remarks such as this is not conducive to a productive and respectful debate.|`|8599c16fb8c024a84d9e0e7d395be5baaa	No... you don't understand the English language. "pro" means "in favor of". I agree that "pro choice" is a somewhat misleading term. But "pro abortion" would be as well, because that suggests that pro choice is actually in favor of abortion. Which isn't necessarily the case: people can be pro choice because they think it will happen anyway, better let it happen safe. Or because they think that the decision isn't theirs to make.    "pro life" is a pretty misleading term as well. As if anyone who is not "pro life" is against life.|`|mfC7b6tgaa	I am VERY pro choice. What that means to me is that no body should have the right to tell some one what to do with their body end of story. On the same note I would never condemn someone for getting an abortion but wouldn't get one myself under normal circumstances ie; healthy fetus,etc. Getting an abortion is a very personal choice that only that person should have the right to make.

You won't be successful in bringing murder charges, however.

bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Yes indeed. I found this a while back,  wish I came up with it myself.    1. Jesus owned nothing. 2. Jesus argued for the dissolution of the family and the establishment of communes. 3. Jesus loved all people regardless of ethnicity or class. 4. Jesus revolted against the imperial government, established religion and finance capitalism (usury). 5. Jesus taught that we should act as one body, one blood. 6. Jesus taught that his kingdom (ie nation state) is in the heart and not below the feet. 7. Jesus taught that we should fight for Justice and 'turn the other cheek' to petty morality. 8. Jesus was a laborer and a teacher. 9. Jesus practiced healing and forgiveness. 10. Jesus taught that you can't be an imperialist and a disciple at the same time.|`|9BeUbORtaa	Obviously, it's not really appropriate to use modern words like "socialist" to apply to the first-century mission of Jesus. But I certainly think it is appropriate to interpret the mission of Jesus in a socialist (or even an anarchist) light. He didn't seem particularly to care for the authorities, be they religious or secular, but he didn't think highly of private property or individual wealth either. If concern for the poor and disadvantaged is socialism, then yes, Jesus was a socialist.     "He hath put down the mighty from their seat : and hath exalted the humble and meek. He hath filled the hungry with good things : and the rich he hath sent empty away."   Luke 1:52-53    This is certainly how the early Church seems to have interpreted Christ's mission, with its emphasis on communal living and shared property. The monastic tradition in Christianity is the survival of this early tradition.    The Protestant tradition, however, has emphasised the individual importance of Christ's mission, and stressed the spiritual and moral rather than socially transformative aspects of his message. I think this amputation of the 'social Gospel' is a mistake. Nevertheless, it is important to remember that the 'revolution' Jesus looks towards is not a new economic regime, but the coming of God's kingdom on earth.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"    The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.    There are a lot more chapters and verses mentioned in the below website along with music, speeches and praise and worship.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    Jesus is God. He is alive forever.    The questions usually asked are:-    1) Did Jesus really exist?  2) Is Jesus God?  3) If Jesus is God, then why did He keep praying to the Father in Heaven? How can the Father and Jesus be one God? Why did Jesus have to suffer on the Cross?  4) What is the Holy Spirit?  5) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?      It would not be possible to give a short answer to these questions .    I suggest you visit the below website.    After visiting the below website, you would get a lot of answers.    http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com    1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus  specifically.)  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became  flesh (John 1:1-14)  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as  "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT  (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the  Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things  by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship  is used in each place.)  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts  7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father  that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John  8:58.  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see  Exodus 3:14.  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).  26.

99xBLoLcaa	No limits.    There are circumstances under which an abortion may be absolutely required in the final weeks of gestation.  I won't describe them as they're rather gruesome and anyway I'm not a doctor.  Suffice it to say that there are occasions when an almost-fully-developed baby must die if its mother is to have a chance of survival.    However, that's not my reason for saying "No limits on abortion."    My reason is:  If we believe that people are free agents in the first week of pregnancy, and that they're also free agents in the 40th week of pregnancy, then the rules should be same throughout the pregnancy.    In other words: Nobody gets to tell me what to do in the first trimester, in the third trimester, or at any other damn time.    Fortunately, there's a way to make it less likely that anyone would have occasion to interfere with my reproductive life: Make all forms of contraception widely available to all females aged, let's say, 14 and older, no prescription required and no questions asked.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Not sure of an exact time, but I think it should be at that point where a fetus could survive outside the womb.|`|wR1XyyrUaa	I think it should be legal all the way up to the point that her water breaks.|`|GQk0UNjfaa	first trimester unless medically necessary|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Once the third trimester hits, termination should occur only if there is significant medical risk or emergency.|`|4yg7zZZ2aa	Where I live, the Basic Law of the Russian Federation on Citizens Healthcare says; abortion can be performed on request up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, for social reasons up to 22 weeks, and for medical necessity and upon the womans consent at any point during pregnancy.    I agree with that.|`|E9chZY74aa	Culture is not the measure of right.  The Bible is the standard.

Bo - That's actually really good.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	The word you're looking for is "viability." A fetus is usually viable, meaning able to live outside the womb, between 24 and 26 weeks gestation, based on an average 39 weeks' gestation. There are exceptions and variations, of course.     I don't think a viable fetus should be aborted, but since I am a man and can't get pregnant, it really isn't any of my business. There are always extenuating circumstances.|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Until the 26th week, when the higher brain functions activate.|`|y02PZj22aa	Yes--first trimester.    In my state, there is no time limit.  I have debated the issue with leaders of the anti-abortion movement in this state for years:  My belief is that the state legislature will limit the mother's right to choose to the first trimester if the factions with an interest in abortion rights will compromise on the legislation.  The anti-abortion forces have absolutely refused to compromise for 20 years or more--they want "all" or "nothing."  Currently, they have "nothing."  You can get an abortion in this state as long as you haven't gone into labor yet.  I have no idea if anyone is doing that, but legally, it can be done.|`|9df77ae12f17971731e9883919813c91aa	i think the first trimester is enough time to make up your mind...    unless there is a medical problem.|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	the law is fine as is. the MAJORITY of abortions occur in the first 12-14 weeks. it's pretty rare for abortions to occur electively after that point.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	First trimester, more so in case of medical emergency.    I'm not some jerk who says 'a fetus is a baby' but then nor am I someone who says 'it's just a piece of flesh'.

But really it should be up to when a foetus is able to live without medical attention outside the womb.|`|SmkOq5piaa	Yeah, no later than the first trimester.    After that, it's just cruel and disgusting.|`|y8p5GHaZaa	I think their should be a time limit and it should be early.  I see no reason to wait more that a few weeks to get an abortion.  As for how long, I'm not a doctor so i'm not sure, I'd have to do some research there.|`|oYb4yC0jaa	Add a little more to this and tell me what YOU think...Wait, you're a man so what you think is basically irrelevant...wait, I'm male too and now there is no easy way to stop...|`|g0ZT45OBaa	When the baby/fetus is able to survive outside the womb, it should be illegal.|`|X548yCR6aa	I think after the first trimester it should not be performed except in extreme cases.|`|P0uh2Ckiaa	I count myself as pro-choice, and will answer your question thusly:    If a fetus is capable of surviving on its own outside the womb with a reasonable amount of care (including everything a term infant might need: respirator, occasional IV, etc), then it is considered "viable" and in my opinion constitutes a separate life and should therefore be counted as an individual human.    If, however, that fetus is so underdeveloped as to be incapable of survival outside the womb then it is no better than a parasite, since it behaves as one. A tapeworm is also wholly dependent on its host, and i have no qualms about disposing of it as such.    That's always been my personal defining line, and i believe that's the rule of thumb a lot of legislation uses as well: an embryo is an infant if it can survive on its own outside the mother. For this reason, i am against partial-birth abortions but see no problem with a woman choosing to terminate a very early pregnancy.    Short version: limit = viability.|`|O9omaIDAaa	On demand, during the first trimester, but only if there are extenuating medical or legal grounds, after that.|`|rEDfuU7Naa	When a fetus can survive on its own outside of the womb then I think it should be banned after that point. That's at about 4 months, isn't it?|`|N9VN9bwfaa	I think the last trimester should have limits on it, since the child is viable in that period.  But there should still be abortions available under certain conditions.  If the life of the mother is at risk, she should have the option to abort to save herself -- if there's no way the child can be born safely.  Sometimes at this point a woman learns that the child has a terminal condition such as anencephaly, which means that the child has only the lower portion of the brain and can only live for a few days.  I see no point in forcing the mother to carry such an infant full term and then watch it deteriorate, dragging out the agony.  She should have the option to abort under such circumstances.  Similarly, if it turns out that the child has severe deformities, say, two heads, and there is little likelihood that anything can be done to make the poor thing viable so it will have a normal life, the mother should have the option of aborting.  She should not be forced to do this, but she should have this tragic option.  Sometimes horrible things happen and terrible choices must be made.  I worked as a nurse and I saw some of these.  It doesn't make things better to have the heavy hand of government making a decision for the family, without compassion, without regard for circumstances.    Sometimes also a woman discovers late in her pregnancy that she is carrying more than one child and that one is viable but the other child is not.  Carrying both to full term with endanger the larger one.  In such a case, she should be allowed to choose to abort the smaller, less viable one in order to preserve the life of the other.  I saw such a case when the mother did not have this option and it led to the ultimate death of all three -- the littler one died in the womb causing the older one to die shortly after birth, and the mother died within a week of sepsis.  The father was heart-broken, left with a two-year old to raise alone.    So it's easy to say one is "pro-life" but sometimes being pro-choice is the more life-affirming choice.|`|IDcIww7Baa	Well, when the baby is able to make it on his own, he should be given that opportunity....I'm no doctor, so I don't know for sure when that is...I've heard month 7. So abortions really not an option any more at that point, in my opinion.|`|tMURptI6aa	First trimester. For medical reasons as well as mental and emotional. If a woman can't make up her mind within a few weeks, chances are, she will question the decision for the rest of her life. Abortion should be an easy choice. It was for me. When I was 19 and pg I knew exactly what I wanted to do and the only bad part was having to wait. I was 5 weeks along when it was extracted. Waiting even that long was pure torture because I knew that I DID NOT want it inside me. I can't imagine being in my second trimester thinking "well ... should I? Hmm, maybe."

But if a fatal accident should occur, then you must give soul for soul, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, branding for branding, wound for wound, blow for blow." (Exodus 21:22-25)    Your justifications and rationalizations don't trump scripture.

If you personally don't want them give them up for adoption so that they can be loved as they ought to be. It isn't the children who should not be allowed to live but it is the parents who tried to abort (kill) them who should probably not be allowed the rear them.    Mrs. Nesbitt, have you never heard about 'partial birth abortions' done at the end of a 9 month pregnancy?      For those who think that no-one has ever survived an attempted abortion, you are so wrong. 'Aborted' babies have been found to be alive when they are just about to be put in the sluice. You can read the stories of some who survived, and are living today, on the internet.

LuN1unJ3aa	Some people are like that and some religious denominations even teach hatred toward others who do not follow their exact path.

This applies to most of the world's major religions, as well.|`|TOnq6w6Baa	If that's true what your saying then sincerity and honesty are on the fore front of their lives now.  I can tell you when I became born again I wanted to yell it from the roof to all the people I knew to get on the boat with me and not to waste their time any more searching the tangible.  But the more I tried the more they looked at me as a nut and blew me off.  So in time I realized I couldn't be around them any more cause they just were trying harder to pull me back into my old life. So... because of the way they were treating me and knowing that talking to them was not getting me any where just frustrated and offended by them, I'm sure that during that time, I may have looked self righteous at times and rude to them.  That's my story|`|E9chZY74aa	I have not found that to be true, quite the opposite.|`|9ed79b2c402a7fe054faaa860538c607aa	I'm very religious and I have many friends, and I know lots of other religious people who are friendly, so I have no idea what you're talking about.|`|ki0tOVUYaa	people are attracted to a religious system that reflects their temperment and personality; they often end up in a vicious cycle if they are in any way negative to begin with. for example, a rigid person will become a fundamentalist. a brainiac will become an ideologue and so on.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	We have just enough religion to make us hate but not enough to make us love one another.  -  Jonathan Swift.    You do not have to read many christian posts on here to realize just how accurate he was!!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	That just made no sense at all....If anything your point would be, How come the less caring, more bombastic, less friendly and sincere a person is, the more they invoke religion ??? Wouldn't it. I mean if you put it in a syllogism. Religion is professedly against that way of acting so why not just make the logical choice and put 'religiosity' in that other group of traits.     See, the main failing in Y!A is just reason and logic.|`|MMImKRAgaa	may be they are more focused in one direction, and not so much less caring but less attentive to things of the flesh. I am not saying this is a good thing, but thats not only an religious ideal either, military, capitalist...|`|Ex4Lv68yaa	What answer number one said.  Plus, believing in religion means that they don't have to face themselves but deny who they truly are by means of hiding in religion.    Most use religion to cover up their own issues instead of facing them head on and then dealing with them.  In turn, they bash others for the same issues they themselves have, but now it's okay because they've been saved.  :)  Now knowing this, they think they don't have to put forth any effort any more, they're cured!....No offense, I've met several....that's why I left religion years ago, because of the hypocrisy of it all.|`|8OpFYoO4aa	Are you speaking of yourself, Golden Meadows?|`|89MKzLl3aa	No, that's not true. If religion as a whole was corrupt, the whole world would be much more corrupt than it is today, since religions are responsible for so many charities and foreign missions world wide. Some religious people may be hypocritical, but it's dismissive to criticize religion itself.|`|AA11124121	This may be true in your social sphere of the planet.    However, what you're asking is:    Why are people more intolerant of others once they become spiritual, or religious."    Some people need to. Ignore them and move on.|`|FOZGMadaaa	Often we look on the outside and we measure things by what we perceive a Christian should be. Then we call it religion because it just does not make sense to us.    Attitudes about a God that ask for nothing but gave us everything is hard to conceive. The word of God is hard to understand,it can become insurmountable. So we walk away from God.We just do not believe he exist.    God gives his Holy spirit because he knew we could not do what he needed us to do. He orchestrated the plan for our salvation. Without him we can do nothing.    God does not require niceness nor does he require us to be religious.God chooses ordinary people. Down to earth people,everyday people. He does the work for us. We seek him because he prompts us to do so,by his spirit. Now we can refuse to do it. Is that in your best interest?     So we cannot take credit for what God does for us and through us. So we praise him for his deliverance and Salvation power.    It takes a personal relationship with the Father to be able to stand the test of time. We go through trails and test. God shapes us and molds us never taking his hands off of us,making us fit for his use.We are temporary vassals. Then he puts us in the fire,setting his watch until we are done. The flames perfect us. It is painful. Even the world says no pain no gain.     Religion is a shield for most in this world. But it cannot protect any from God. God makes all men for a purpose be it good or bad God has a plan.    The world is not friendly and not be sincere. Simply because they are lead by their father the Devil. They work by his spirit inside of them.That is religion.So they come among the Church and attempt to discourage others by their actions. Hell bent on destrucion of the plans of God.    The Holy spirit is a gift of God that hell can not come against. God gives us discernment. Can you see? Their intent is to look as if they are deeper and really involved.But just like the snake in the garden of eden. He tricked Adam and Eve so they sinned. They forgot what God said. They wanted to do it their way.|`|64192d3934541ee64b034e0da99e0feaaa	Might be something to do with them knowing "the truth" (usually with no evidence to support it) to the exclusion of other people who dont accept their version of "the truth".|`|liGEQEz4aa	What you're saying is that you don't really know any truly religious people.|`|8n2NO6UVaa	It is not true, a religious person will be more religious if they submit to God's wills that is to be more charitable, more kind, ectra ectra    They are not religious if they are miserly or selfish.|`|yH6JPjwOaa	People will be people the problem isn't with the religion its with the people.|`|LwRNEgdWaa	Dear friend,   your question is really a good question as it is offenly seen that the person involved in the religion normally behaves with others as odd person which he should not do. But think, the person who is associated with GOD or religion obviously will have some different view as compared to a common man. Because it is not an easy task to have a deep link with GOD and if a person do so , he may be a special person or chosen person of GOD. Thus the link with GOD makes him different with other common persons but simultaneously it is also true that such person who is in fact attached with religion may never be a bad man. He will always love to the people of GOD and be a nice person and behave like a nice person.If a person is less caring about the others or ignore others it means he is not a religious person rather he is a person who is taking shelter of religion for doing his bad work.|`|r0Q34IsCaa	I have actually studied many religions and am a Christian.  I do however know exactly what you mean.  So here is my theory:    When someone is so wrapped up in what they perceive as being a good whatever their belief is, they forget that you don't just have to be able to  spout this stuff off, that it is not just enough to turn up at church or whatever.  You need to practice it as well.    Many people fall into the trap that if someone is a "Sinner" that they have done something wrong in their  lives to bring them to this, without thinking that something awful may have made them the way they are, and it is not a personal choice.    I have seen it so many times that I have given up going to church.  I do so wish that people would start living by the gospel instead of preaching it.

They recognize that "Mormons" are not represented by the strawmen the Tanners have created to fight "Mormonism."    A lot of the claims made about the LDS (Mormon) Church are based upon half-truths and those pushing an anti-Mormon agenda will drop into ad hominen attacks when faced with actual, verifiable facts.    That is also a major reason why you'll see thumbs down when someone provides links to the teachings of the Church, including on-line versions of the manuals used in the church.    Edit: By the way, this kind of anti- rhetoric is the same kind that is handed out by those who oppose Catholicism and many other Christian denominations that do not fit with the "accepted norm" of "Traditional Christianity."

Faith is believing in that which is hoped for but not yet seen. God uses the simple things to confound those who think they have knowledge.

But the greatest insight on the question comes from Epicurus:    Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able?  Then he is not omnipotent.  Is he able, but not willing?  Then he is malevolent.  Is he both able and willing?  Then whence cometh evil?  Is he neither able nor willing?  Then why call him God?|`|mC4mnvGFaa	there are no gods, but nice try|`|ATPPWOpWaa	As it is you choose not to believe in God.   I choose to believe in Him in His absence.

John 8:44  You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire. He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth, for there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks his native language, for he is a liar and the father of lies.    Romans 9  19One of you will say to me: "Then why does God still blame us?  For who resists his will?"  But who are you, O man, to talk back to God? "  Shall what is formed say to him who formed it,  'Why did you make me like this?' "Does not the potter have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for noble purposes and some for common use?

Evil is the absence of good, just as dark is the absence of light, and cold is the absence of heat.    Once all the heat is removed from the object, you can not add more cold to it; once all the light is removed from an area, you can not add more darkness.    Satan is evil because he has pushed away God and all that is good.    He has done so after having seen the absolute goodness of God, and that makes him absolutely evil.

2BBKHggeaa	Jesus says: I say to you, You are Peter, and on this rock-mass I will build my congregation, and the gates of Hades will not overpower it. Here Jesus first announces that he will build a congregation and that even death will not hold its members captive after their faithful course on earth. Then he tells Peter: I will give you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.    Jesus thus reveals that Peter is to receive special privileges. No, Peter is not given first place among the apostles, nor is he made the foundation of the congregation. Jesus himself is the Rock-Mass upon which his congregation will be built. But Peter is to be given three keys with which to open, as it were, the opportunity for groups of people to enter the Kingdom of the heavens.    Peter would use the first key at Pentecost 33?C.E. to show repentant Jews what they must do to be saved. He would use the second shortly afterward to open to believing Samaritans the opportunity to enter Gods Kingdom. Then, in 36?C.E. he would use the third key to open to uncircumcised Gentiles, Cornelius and his friends, the same opportunity.|`|AA11124121	In this verse, Jesus is speaking directly to the Apostle Peter, and indirectly to the other apostles. Jesus' words meant that Peter would have the right to enter the kingdom himself, would have general authority therein symbolized by the possession of the keys, and preaching the Gospel would be the means of opening the kingdom of heaven to all believers and shutting it against unbelievers. The book of Acts shows us this process at work. By his sermon on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14-40), Peter opened the door of the kingdom for the first time. The expressions "bind" and "loose" were common to Jewish legal phraseology meaning to declare forbidden or to declare allowed.|`|XJhiXoDVaa	it means that when you get divorced cus u like some one else it not becus u dont like that person its but cus u love that person i know its hard for me to put it in words|`|TgfuqPiLaa	In that scripture Jesus is referring to himself as the "rock".         The name Peter means "a rock or a stone"  (Strong's  G4074)  1) one of the twelve disciples of Jesus    Matthew 16:18..And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, (Peter means "a rock or stone")  and upon "THIS" rock (meaning Jesus Himself) I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.    Another scripture where Jesus refers to Himself as "THIS".  John 2:19..Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy "THIS" temple, (meaning Himself) and in three days I will raise it up    Here are other scriptures that also refer to Jesus as the "ROCK".    1 Cor 10:4...  And did all drink the same spiritual drink: for they drank of that spiritual Rock that followed them: and that Rock was Christ.    Mark 12:10...  And have ye not read this scripture; The stone which the builders rejected is become the head|`|liGEQEz4aa	In Matthew 16: 18-19 Christ is acknowledging that the Apostle Peter is the first of the Disciples to know that Jesus Christ is the actual Son of God.  The other Disciples had not figured that out yet.  When Christ said it was not flesh and blood that revealed it to St. Peter, He meant that God, or the Holy Spirit revealed that fact to St. Peter, and since St. Peter was the one who got that "message" or awareness first, he would be the foundation or "rock" of the Church that Christ would establish on earth.  St. Peter became the bishop in Jerusalem and taught, wrote, and preached to the new Christians there, who were mostly converted from Judaism.  (Whereas St. Paul taught and preached mostly to Christians who were converted from being Gentiles).   When Christ is talking about binding and loosening, He's talking about the confession of sins.  Since the beginning of Christianity, Christians have had the tradition of confession of sins.  It's the clergy of the Church who act as witnesses of that confession to Christ, and then, on behalf of Christ either bind or loose a person from their sins, through the grace given them by Christ.  That verse is a comment on a particular sacrament, or mystery of the Church.  Good question.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Jesus is the rock.  I Corinthians 10:4.    The devil will not prevail over the Church.    The keys to the kingdom were spiritual. Peter gave the correct plan of salvation in Acts 2:38.|`|iNn9mmOtaa	The conversion is 3 staged: Simon-->Peter-->Converted Peter.  When Peter talks law, he's called Satan, told to get converted,  and let's remember it's Peter who denies him thrice, and twice.  Converted Peter gets converted by reading all of Paul's epistles.  So you should do likewise, for 2/3 = 0.666 to infinity of nothing.    As for plural keys, to plural divided heavens,  no key is even req'd for an ever open door of grace,  which doesn't both open and shut like a trap door does.  So consider a door in Rev 3 that opens + shuts could be a trap,  or allegorically an open and shut case of law gotcha, if unaware.
f24a4de342b1375dc37e91955d32d1a1aa	Wiccans have a 3-fold law, that what you send out comes back to you three times as strong. Kind of amplified karma. So it's not a good idea to hurt someone else, even if you think you have a good reason. There are other ways of dealing with it that do not cause additional dysfunction.|`|LuN1unJ3aa	It is all about balance. What many people do not realize is that Wicca is neutral, that is, it is neither "good" or "bad." Practitioners work toward harmony with nature, which by its nature, is also neither "good" or "bad." Therefore, if a person does something bad to another person, they fully expect to be visited with something bad happening to them.    It is a bit like the Christian belief of "Do unto others..." or "What goes around, comes around..."    Wicca tends to be pragmatic, rather then mystic.|`|21808938a2c954ea0389683f10267c69aa	Wiccans recongize that there are consewuences to all actions, and we have to be willing to accept those consequences.  if the consequences are unacceptable, you shouldn't do the action.    Causing harm is an unpleasant thing.  Sometimes the benefits outweigh the drawbacks: slaughter for food, fighting off an attacker, etc.      "Cursing" is almost always done for vengeance.  There's no positive goal for it.  You've been wronged, and you think you'll feel better if the other person also suffers.  That's a very dark place to be, and there are consequences for doing such.    This isn't specific to Wiccans.  This happens to everyone.  Wiccans happen to acknowledge it (as do lots of other people)|`|X548yCR6aa	Wiccans believe that if you wish others harm, harm will come to you.

Instead it sounds like a good thing that your friend does not wish to curse anybody. That is wrong. Wiccans follow the wiccan rede which states the rule of three - if you do good, it returns to you threefold similarly if you do bad it also returns to you threefold. It is Universal Justice - not anythign harsh at all.     If there is anything that needs evening out then the karma of the wrongdoer will even itself out by itself. She need not curse anybody for that. The universal law of karma will take care of it.|`|AA11742929	do some research on wicca, it may help you understand a little better.

Nobody can conceive that nature ever intended to throw away a Newton upon the occupations of a crown. It would have been a prodigality for which even the conduct of Providence might have been arraigned, had he been by birth annexed to what was so far below him. Cooperating with nature in her ordinary economy, we should dispose of and employ the geniuses of men according to their several orders and degrees.""""      1 Corinthians 1  21 For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles(you and I),    Matthew 11:25  At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.    2 Corinthians 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.

The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches:    2271 Since the first century the Church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion. This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law:     You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish.     God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes.     2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society.    2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27  3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life.     2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being.     Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."|`|JXLiZEb2aa	Most Catholics are pro-life but there are certain groups that are pro-choice.

xGmbEzOZaa	You're correct, it does depend mostly on the individual. But, I'd say if the person is living in an area where the citizens only speak French, then the person could pick up the language within a few months. Perhaps, with persistent effort, they can become competent in the language within a few years.    I'm living in the United States now, but I have family from South Vietnam and South Korea.|`|suSWUm5Jaa	Yes, it depends on the person (just like anything else, some people are more or less talented). Another factor is age. The younger you are, the easier it will be for you to learn it. Finally, it depends if you have prior knowledge or not at all.    The good news is: immersion is the best way to learn and you will learn it, whether you want it or not (provided you are really surrounded by locals, as opposed to having fellow English speakers around).    Generally speaking, after a few weeks, you will be able to express yourself and be understoof. It will take a few months (6 or more) to be close to fluent or fluent.    I come from France but lived abroad for years, inclusing 7 in the US. I knew some basic English before living in the US. Took me a couple of years to feel I was fluent. But I was able to work in an English speaking envionment after only a few months.|`|ulQEXb1yaa	I'm interested in answers to this Q, as I might be moving to France.  I'm 16 and have been learning French at school for a few years, but I am nowhere near fluent.    I think that with effort and full intergration into France, anyone could theoretically become pretty competent in French...the accent might take time, and the idioms and other literary devices will be the hardest to master.  I'm English.

Reason being, Jesus words at Matthew 24:44 "On this account YOU too prove yourselves ready, because at an hour that YOU do not think to be it, the Son of man is coming."    It won't be any of these doomsday prophecies with specific dates that end up being right.|`|qiNr0AqJaa	I think so.   The Mayans could not be wrong.  If Jesus comes back, look busy.|`|aPtk8iEXaa	false teachers has put this out thee the Mayans even Nostradamus, Jesus said there would be no prophet after him, so anyone that follows a calender, palmist, voodoo, spiritual leader or astrologist is following the work of the devil.    We do know know how Gods time works he said he built this earth in 6 days and on the 7th rested  is that literally 7 days as we know it or is Gods time calender different I believe different!    You really think that Jesus would make us stress on a dooms day scenario such as the earth will no longer exist...just the opposite, the LUCKY get to live on earth time indefinite.

To me, that is enough information to know that they are real. Or maybe they were raised not to believe in Christianity. On the Secret Life of the American Teenager Ricky was sexually abused by his father, and said he spent too many nights begging God that his father wouldn't come in for a beating to believe that prayer really works. Maybe people have been in a situation like that, and then just grew against Christianity.

If I say to you, You make me sick to my stomach, youd probably find plenty to argue with me about in that sentence. The difference is intention. If I say, My stomach feels queasy, my intention is to reveal my inner experience. If I say, You make me sick to my stomach, my intention is to blame you for my experience. In speaking difficult truths so that people thank you afterwards, the trick is to reveal your inner experience and stay out of blame.
