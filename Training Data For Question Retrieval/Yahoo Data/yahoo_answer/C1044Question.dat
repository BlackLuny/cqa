They were trying to make Batista the next Stone Cold and John Cena the next rock but it backfired and although faces, they received mixed reactions.      And yet people like Edge and Orton while heels, also get mixed reactions. Basically what I mean is there will never be another Rock or Stone Cold, but WWE dont see things like this.

20090309130027AAJF0vs	Sports;Hockey	The "Las Vegas NHL Debate" Continues?	One more time! - Why shouldn't LV have an NHL team?      It is absolutely amazing to me that people think no one lives in LV or that all the people who DO live there live in weekly motels, they’re all gamblers and work in tourist and gambling industries.      There have actually been appalling responses saying that only the tourists would go to the games and you have to get a new flock of tourists every game so the casinos would have to give away tickets!      Come on folks! LV is a city with a population of over 2million people! (28th largest in the US and the fastest growing) Many of those people are transplanted from northern cities and they miss the hell out of their hockey!      Do you people think that no one lives in Orlando or Anaheim because of Disneyland/world? Do you think Disney employs everyone that lives there? DO you think they all sit around watching Disney movies all day?      Another ridiculous point people are making is that all the players will hang out in the casinos and develop gambling problems. / Folks there’s casinos all over! These players could do that NOW if they wanted to! – Most of them are young, responsible adults. They’re not stupid children! – Even if they wanted to hang out in the casinos… so damn what! Gambling is perfectly legal and these people can do whatever the hell they want with their money!      OK – My question… Being that most of your justification is ridiculous nonsense… Can ANYONE give me a good reason NOT to have an NHL team in Las Vegas NV?

20090309123503AAnWtua	Sports;Volleyball	The Coach Hardly Ever Plays My Daughter In Club volleyball HELP!?	My daughter tried out and made the 14U team for a local volleyball club. She has been playing school and club ball for 3 years and loves it more than anything. She is very commited and has a goal of playing in college. She has improved immensly over the years but still needs to refine her skills. She is smaller than most of the other players so she has always played in the back row. Her coach made her a Libero but switches her out with another small player on the team. This has allowed our daughter to play the back row and serve when not playing as a lIbero and visa-versa.    The team has not done the greatest in tournaments but is improving all the time. Every player makes mistakes and some of them make the same ones over and over again but they are learning from their mistakes. The coach has gotten increasingly frustrated with them because they aren't winning much. During one tourney she told them that she was only going to play the girls that knew how to play the game so my daughter didn't play any matches the rest of the day.    Now it has become common for our daughter to be kept out for an entire match while all the other girls play. Some of them are never subbed out even though they lose points for the team repeatedly for the same errors. The last straw was at the last tourney yesterday when she stood out for 3 matches in a row.They were in the semifinals and won. She had played well in the previous matches, of course making a few mistakes but nothing terrible. She went for every ball but lost a few. Nothing that I could see that would warrant her not playing for nearly 3 hours at the end of a long day and spending her time cheering her teammates on.     I know the coach was looking for a win but why at the expense of another player? It was so obvious to everyone and now my daughter has been labled as a player that has no real place on the team.Her teamates feel it isn't fair and they want her to play. My daughter asked the coach 3 times during those matches if she would put her in and all she said was, "We'll see".     I have spent way too much money and time for her to not play the game while others are rarely subbed out. If she needs to improve her skills how is she supposed to do that if she doesn't play the game? I really need help and some suggestions on how to talk to this coach. Her next tourney is 4 hours away with a 2 night stay in a hotel and I refuse to travel there if all she's going to do is be the teams cheerleader.

I seriously doubt hed take a gift basket of Yankees tickets,a Ferrari,hotel suites,and a higher salary to play for the mess that is the Knicks. If he wanted to he could just buy that himself. Its even sadder for the people that acutally donate to that site. I doubt they would be able to get $30 million anyway(the amount needed to match Cavs match offer). Pro athletes are not the people to be donating money too, they're already filthy esp. in the mist of a recession. Money should actually go to people who need. Its something thats also unlikely to happen. Its filled with arrogance as they sad "the change we want and deserve". If they deserve something they should make smart trades and draft picks to get what they deserve.      What do you think of Knicks fans donating money for a cause that might not even happen?

Also, when i read the transportation laws they only mention rifles needing to be unloaded and everything else has to do with pistols. Does that mean it is legal to have the m1 unloaded in a case under the seat even if not going to the range?

When the coach pulled me aside and told me i was cut i was extremly surpirsed as well as alot of players around me. Should i feel like i got shafted or what should I do? i think less of the coach for cutting me even though i have been playing a long time and went to all these preseason conditions that were "important to attend"      On a side note the coach asked me to be team manager...I dont know if i want to do it since alot of my friends were cut as well..

20090309135912AAEPBa2	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	How much more ignorant can some shirt sellers be?	Have you guys read about this Manchester United bringing out a shirt saying "There's only 1 Ronaldo!"? In my view, it's in a reference to the real Ronaldo being non-existent. As saying Cristiano Ronaldo is better in a way to put it. That's how I see it.       http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/footbal...     http://www.ronaldohome.com/2009/03/corin...       What do you guys think of this?    Personally, I think it's very stupid and ignorant to try to even compare Cristiano Ronaldo with Ronaldo "El Fenomeno". To me, there is no comparison, Cristiano is nobody standing next to Ronaldo. I read this comment on another website, and this comment said something that seemed so true to me, the comment said "Honestly, only people who are young, girls who think he's hot, or people who have started watching football 3 or 4 years ago would think Cristiano Ronaldo is better, anyone who actually knows what Ronaldo did and saw him play, would really know who's better, which is "The Real" Ronaldo, "El Fenomeno". I think that's very true. Anyways, what do you guys think of this?

Most people blindly criticize it because it's not the old ECW but they still use the name. Then the first thing they say is "It's not even EXTREME".      Well, people should check the show out and stop going into it with an already existing bias. The recent match between Jack Swagger and Christian for the ECW championship was GREAT, one of the best matches I've seen in a while.       Also on ECW, a lot of the problems people have with the rest of WWE don't exist on this brand. Don't like promos? ECW runs very few to none. Like wrestling? ECW showcases the MOST (and sometimes best) wrestling in all of WWE.

Tell me all of your thoughts on this please, BA goes to most ndetailed and best reasons why one.
20090309140439AAg2SdO	Sports;Wrestling	What was your opinion of Chris Masters when he was in WWE?	I thought he was brilliant!      I adored his gimmick, it was so unique and fun!      Except for his wrestling skills, he had the whole package:      * Size   * Build   * Strength   * Look   * Charisma   * Mic skills   * Unique gimmick      I seen him winning a main championship in his first 5 years in WWE since he had loads of air time, and was in the elimination chamber in his first year.      I really enjoyed him, its just a pity that I temporarily didn't watch wrestling when he was around. He'd be the face of ECW and would be able to improve on his wrestling skills if he was on ECW right now. He would have been great on that brand, he'd be given huge pushes and be really over with the crowd when he came off it. He was also very humorous!      Ah I miss The Masterlock Challenge, it was so exciting, fun and funny!      But don't worry, you don't have to agree with me to get BA, it will be given to the one with the most detail and best reasons why, regardless of their opinion. Thanks very much!

20090309143956AARN3ye	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	Will you fight the Mexican cartels?	If the Mexican drug war spills into the USA and our federal government begins to have firefights in the streets with them and their mercenary armies. What will you do, will you call 911 or grab your 7.62? If they were fighting close to your city, hometown, home or property will you fight back against the cartels?      Important Fact:      Mexico already has some of the world's toughest gun control laws, the reason why so many Mexican civilians are dying is because they cannot defend themselves and are trapped in the crossfire between drug cartel mercenaries and the Mexican army.   Maybe if the Mexican government wasn't so progun control and allowed its citizens to have guns and defend themselves, the people of Mexico would rise against the drug lords.

Ok, so I'm pretty sure that the best place to have a player sign a jersey is on the number (but, please correct me if I'm wrong about that). I have a Yankee jersey that odviously has a navy blue number. What is is the best type of pen to have it signed with? I think I need a color like silver. What is the best type of pen and where can I buy one?   Thanks!!      And please don't say anything rude like no Yankee will ever sign a jersey or something stupid like that. I've gotten a ton of Yankee autographs on balls, and the player who I'm trying to get to sign the jersey (Jeter) has signed a ball for me, I just didn't have the jersey with me at that time. So please, no rude comments. Thanks for any help.

20090309144019AAWVRrW	Sports;Cycling	SPD Unwillingly Disengaged?	Hi      Today I was using my SPD shoes in a spin class and during fast-paced sprints my left shoe came out of the pedals. Luckily the cleat was still attached to the shoe (I've seen it happen that the cleat comes out of the shoe and gets stuck in the pedals - which is very difficult to get out).      But why did this happen? Surely the idea of the SPD clipless system is that the shoe can't come out unless twisted outwards. Oh and yes, I do have Single Release Cleats. I've gone that speed before, and never encountered any trouble      I'm worried now. Could the cleat or the shoe be damaged? How do I prevent this from happening again (as you can't freewheel on a spin bike so a foot dangling loose when the pedals are going at 'blur' speed is dangerous).      I asked the instructor who said it might be just the grip on the pedals and to make sure the cleats were tight when I went home. The pedals are set to the lowest release tension on all the bikes, but again I've done that speed before.

20090309151148AAb2gvN	Sports;Baseball	A new way to play baseball, is this within the rules?	My buddy has devised an ingenious way to play baseball. Since all players must be in uniform they all dress up in catcher's gear.      The catcher is in regular position as is the Pitcher. However the entire IF has crept up to in front of the pitcher, so has the OF.     Basically, the plan is to have so many people directly in front of the batter that all hit balls are stopped by the guys in catcher's gear jumping up and down. And if you pop it up, one guy roams the field to get the out.     Is this legal? He has been touting this for years and always wonders why nobody has tried it yet. Any thoughts on what I can/should say next time he brings it up? He swears it will work. Why not?

20090309170857AAjP65m	Sports;Other - Sports	Sport Injury Stories?	I tore my ACL 2 years ago, and I was only 11. I was playing a basketball game, and when I went up for a layup, i was rammed from the side, and I tore my ACL. It was hard, because I love basketball, and now I couldn't play it. Later, with months of physical therapy, I was up and running, but I can't participate in any contact sports or play on any teams. Have you or anyone you know been in this situation? What Happened?      And also, have you found anything good about what happened to you?   Me, for example, got two major things out of it. A Wii, as a consolation, and a new skill in basketball. I used to be very good at ball-handling, which I still am, but most of my game was just running past defense and laying it in. Now, I can't do that as often, so I had to settle for jump shots. And, before I knew it, I added a new tier to my game.      So, what stories do you have, and have you found your silver lining?

I'm 14, and I just started skating about 2-3 months ago starting in my garage. so far i can Ollie (its kind of high i guess but its a lot higher when I'm moving fast.) i just started working on pop shuvits like a week ago and today i landed a lot of them and they're pretty good I guess. And i can shuvit. I can drop in at most of the ramps at the skate park I go to, but I've only gone to the park once so far. I have an element fiber light which i guess makes it easier to do tricks. My "friend" across the street always calls me a poser and says that I suck. And people at my school keep saying that I suck at skating and I'm a poser. I don't wear the flat rimmed hats or anything, and I only have a few brand name shirts right now, and my jeans are just normal jeans. I do wear skate shoes also. AM I A POSER???

The bail nearest to them had for whatever reason already been removed, but the one furtherest away was still on the stumps. The throw hits the (bailless) stump, knocking it back into the other two stumps, which removes the remaining bail.      In this case, would the wicket be considered to be broken by the ball, (and thus a run-out be possible), or not?

An offensive player with the ball drives into the key toward the hoop to make a shot (wide open) then turns away from the hoop towards a "moving" defensive player and lowers his shoulder (bracing for impact) and charges into the defensive player clearly in an attempt to push or knockdown the defender?

20090227094619AAKzlqq	Sports;Tennis	Does Andy's decision to drop out of Dubai because of Peer change your opinion of him?	I've heard a lot of stuff about how terrible he is on court and how much of a prick he was off court. I for one have met Andy and yeah, he can be a fratboy sometimes, but he's always been about the game no matter what.      Now with Andy being the ONLY PERSON to protest Dubai straightforward because of the denial to allow Peer to play, does your opinion change?      I'm asking because, in a way, it's kind of like a silver lining to all the bashing Roddick's recieved most of his career from a lot of people. He's remained in the top 10 for more than 5-6 years now and is carrying the longest streak of years where a player has won one title. I've always had to hear how average his game is, and after meeting him, I can tell you that he's always wanting to improve.      And not only that, he showed how good of a locker room leader he is by stepping up for Peer when everyone seriously seems to have chickened out.      So what do you think?

I've always fancied myself as an aerobics instructor, and I'd like to give lessons in hooping as I have my own hoop and if I practise a bit, I'd be quite good. I led a warm-up to music and a cool down last week at a voluntary project, and everyone though I was good!   I wanted to know if you need qualifications to legally be allowed to give classes in the UK?
