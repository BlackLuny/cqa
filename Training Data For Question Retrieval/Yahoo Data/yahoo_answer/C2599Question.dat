It's only a 2 wheel drive so no intense off roading with just driving on dirt paths down to the river.      Also any tips for a good stereo system to put in it? as in do I need to get an amp? and bigger speakers? or just replace old stock ones with new ones?   I need to keep it cheap so keep that in mind.      Thank you,      Also please just explain as well as you can because I'm a little slow in some on these departments.

One of the 10"s stopped working yesterday (I think it blew or something), and I've only had them for 2 weeks, and they aren't pleasing me, so I think when I get the money, I'm going to upgrade.       I'm planning on buying two 12" Alpine Type-R's (  http://www.onlinecarstereo.com/CarAudio/...  ), and I need to know what a good amp would be to power these two subs.      Specs:    2 Ohms each   RMS range 50-500 watt each   Peak power 1500 watt each.      So, yeah... any suggestions on a good amp. I would be willing to spend upwards of $400. Thanks.

20090307035053AAJ1xiL	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Golf GTi Mk2 8v Gearbox probs...can someone please help!?	Hi All,      Bought a Golf GTI Mk2 8v a couple of weeks ago and drove it 200 miles home without any major problems.       A couple of weeks later, the gearbox is whining, it jumps out of 3rd and 5th, plus 2nd and 4th are now pretty hard to engage. I'm pretty sure it's leaking where the driveshafts go into the gearbox. I also get a rattle/noise when the clutch is out but not when it's pressed in...then all sounds fine. Engine jumps all over the place which I'm assuming is down to knackered engine/gearbox mounts as well...      Found a gear shift repair kit on ebay so that seems sorted once it's here, but I'm struggling to find the right parts for the driveshaft seals. I've kinda narrowed it down to a part number 020 498 085 G but I'm just not sure it's right. Someone suggested a mercedes part might do the job but I'm a bit dubious lol.       If anyone can give any pointers that would be great......I can rip apart 80's BMWs no problem, find the part I need and off I go but being a VW noob I'm struggling :)      Thanks a lot      Tom

20090307025446AAS5aTB	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	1993 Ford Thunderbird - NOISE!?	This might be very difficult to explain, therefor it might be difficult to answer.    My '93 T-bird is making this awful strange noise. It happens most when in idle. The best way I can explain it is like a heavy, metal rattle...or buzzing sound. It's not constant...it's intermittent...comes and goes in spurts. Pretty sure it's not engine knocking. It's very noticeable from inside the car when I'm driving when I've stopped at a red light...and of course when I first start it. It's definitely coming from under the hood, as I recently started it, left it in park, and lifted the hood. I'm hoping it's a hose or a belt...keeping my fingers crossed it's not something going on with the engine. I already had to replace the notorious head gaskets. Any insight would be much appreciated! Thanks! :)
20090307051351AARxMkR	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	To repair or not to repair, that is the question.?	I've got a 1993 Thunderbird LX 3.8 with 128k miles on it.      What's good on it:    2 years ago I had to repair the head gaskets, of course, tranny is 8 years old, tranny fluid still clear, new alternator, new tires and breaks, resealed radiator. Still runs well except for a funny noise (see other question).      What's bad:   Cosmetic blemishes. Needs a new paint job for sure, basketball sized dent in the right rear panel  between door and bumper, both front seats and headliner need to be reupholstered, struts and shocks are completely shot, needs new muffler, and has cracks in dashboard.       Given all of that info, should I put the $2,000 or so into it, or should i just get a newer car? I can't afford a brand new one, so my concern is if I get a 5-7 year old car for $5,000 or so, I might wind up putting that 2k into that one anyway. I know if I fix it up and repair it I won't get all of my money out of it. KBB is $1600 for excellent condition, $1050 for fair, which it's in now.    What would you do?    It's not a car that I LOVE, but it's fun to drive and fits me well. It's been a real trooper. And not having a car payment is REALLY nice.

20090307022236AApVxeK	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chrysler	Why won't my 1999 Plymouth Neon go into third gear easily?	I am pretty mechanically inclined but don't know that much about Automatic Transmissions. I have a 1999 Plymouth Neon with a 3 speed automatic.  I have had the car for a while now and it has always made a quick "rev" sound when shifting from 1st gear to 2nd gear. But the other day I noticed when accelerating quickly (e.g. an on ramp to the highway) it doesn't want to go into third. It will bounce off of the rev limiter and if you let your foot out of it the car will then kick into third and you continue to accelerate. I checked the fluid and it is at the good level. Could this be a simple fix, such as a sensor, or is my transmission screwed.

My dad just recently told me about this new law for USA that kids under 12 can't have a motorcycle, because someone said they have lead, which they do in the back of it, but is covered by plastic. So unless you lick your motorcycle (which would be difficult to get to the lead considering it is well covered) you won't get lead poisoning.

I have heard of people getting one and running it for a little while and then all of a sudden now it doesn't have any power or it won't run, the cylinders are oval, the carbs are shot, the powerhead is burnt?   Why is it they wont last very long?      It seems like you can buy a nice fishing boat without a motor on a tandem trailer for next to nothing but then here comes 10K just to put a motor on it.   What gives?

20090307071251AAiGMol	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car will not start?	My car was just fine last night but this morning, went to turn it on and it turned on but turned right back off.  My dad said it sounded like I had no gas but there is a full tank, then he said probably fuel pump?  Anybody agree or could it be a number of different things?  And if it is a fuel pump, how much do you think that will run for a 99 Pontiac Grand AM GT?
20090307061901AAQbFlb	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Volkswagen	Problems With My 1973 Volkswagen Beetle?	I have a completely stock 1973 Volkswagen Std Beetle. I am having a few small electrical problems, which are really nothing more than an annoyment.       1-The directionals usually work, but often they won't turn on and the light on the dash is solid. I replaced the plug, which helped it significantly, but it didn't fully fix the problem. When this happens, I wiggle the plug until it starts working again.       2-The interior light only works when it is pushed down an exact amount, to the millimeter. It recently started working fully, but then it stopped a couple days ago.       I am also having a problem with the automatic choke. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. To get it to work, I slowly floor it and take my foot right off before I start it. But sometimes it doesn't work. Also, when I do get the automatic choke going, which is about 70% of the time, it decides to shut off randomly and the car stalls. I will be waiting for my friend in the driveway with the automatic choke on, and about two minutes after starting it will suddenly shut off (the RPM goes very low) and the car will stall. I don't have these problems on the road, only when I start it up for the first time in about 16-20 hours and when it's below about 30 degrees.       Any answer is greatly appreciated

Granted, I don't want to make a race car out of a SUV (...yet), but I don't want my vehicle taking 10 seconds to go from 55 to 60 mph.

The plane was delivered this morning, and I am currently keeping it by the gates where various staff are cleaning it. It has a wingspan of 99 feet, so it's somewhat cumbersome to move about.   I was thinking of tearing down the servants shed and installing it there, where it is visible from a distance. The servants, I would then stick in the scullery or something, when they have their two hours sleep time.

20090307074315AA6JpRQ	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Honda	Fuel mileage loss in a 2002 Honda Accord.?	So far I have lost almost 100 miles on my 17 gallon tank. I was able to get approximately 320 but now I barely get 240. I have changed the plugs, which looked just fine, oil, filter, etc and no difference. The alignment was perfect and I haven't noticed any breaks sticking. I don't get gas at the same place and I haven't changed my driving routine. The strangest thing is the car runs outstanding and it idols perfectly. Any ideas would be a HUGE help. I am about to take the intake apart to check for carbon buildup but that's all I can think of that might cause my issue. I do not get any trouble codes or anything from what I saw at AutoZone. Could it be a possible primary CO2 slowing down to not cause an error but change fuel ratio? Thanks for your time.

They state that they manufacture wheels.  I was told that in order for the rear wheels to fit properly, they would have to change the offset from a 40 offset to a 43 offset.  Does this make sence to any one?  Is it possible to do this to wheels already manufactured or could they do this when manufacturing the wheel?
